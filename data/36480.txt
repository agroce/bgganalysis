This one takes a commitment (or at least a private room where it can be set up with no fears of cats or kids upsetting the table) You are not gonna finish this the first time round. It's more than a wargame so you have to expect the complication of politics and "backstabbing".

Can be lots of fun, does a good job of evoking the period. Components look great. It also seems reasonably well balanced with four as players take turns blasting each other but usually have an opportunity to get back into it after a turn or two of recovery. Seems like there are multiple tracks; military or political, and a tension between long and short term planning.

On the other hand, its also long, involved, procedural and clunky at times. It took us around five hours to get through two turns of a learning game. Also, the rulebook is a wordy, user unfriendly mess with lots of key rules scattered around amongst dense paragraphs of text.

Bottom line: If you like the period and like long, involved games with diplomacy/bidding etc. then give this one a try. Otherwise it probably isn't worth it.

Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah!  I finally parted ways with this howling dog of iniquity.  What a piece of crap!

_________________________________________

Until a proper rulebook is completed, along with a playbook that lives up to GMT's usual standards, Crown of Roses is Crown of Thorns.  The negatives outweigh the positives, but the positive potential remains.

As of May 2013, I am not sure whether to rate the game a 10 or a 1, to love it or hate it; and it call comes down to the botched set of rules.  If you are on the proverbial fence, wait for the living rules and see if significant improvements are made in correction, clarity and communication.  Ted Racier can step aside as the King of Konfusion when it comes to rulebooks.  Only Clash of Arms' Edelweiss and S&T's Ticonderoga are worse.  It will be a shame to let all of this potential go to waste, but the payoff is not worth the payout at the present time.

___________________________________________

This puts Richard III--the game, not the poor dead king--to shame. 

I am trying to solo-learn CoR so I can teach it to the great gaming group at school that played 1812 Invasion of Canada with me last year. I am using the optional rule where you do not remove blocks during wintering--what were the "design team" thinking when they came up with that idea?  

I sense that the rules will hold water, once you sort them out.  The rule book, as designed, is on the verge of a bad LSD trip--not that I've ever done something like that, but I've seen pictures.  The playbook is a failure at helping players learn the game.  Yes, as posted on CSW, it would take 6, 8, 10 hours to write a good 1st turn, 1st OPS example; so write one!

I hope they will produce the play-aids properly and insert them in the next C3i magazine.

Some further laments:

1) Please provide proper player-aids in the box, not after the fact.  This "design team," of which I have heard much--too much, perhaps--was, is, intelligent enough to know that charts and markers are a necessity, and not an option, for speeding up play of an already long game, while putting complexity where it belongs, in the game-play, and not in figuring out who belongs to whom.

The lack of markers and clear, clean, indicators of what belongs to whom slows down the game.  Did the "design team" just let that one go by?  Or did they improve it in playtesting?  If so, I dread what it was like before someone said, "hey, this is confusing and it is really slowing down the flow of the game." :(

2) The rules are another example of great intelligence combined with poor communication skills, as the designer channeled his inner Ted Racier to make them as garbled and contradictory sounding as most of Ted's material.  If this was your intention, you succeeded.

3) The wintering phase requirement to remove and reposition one's units makes me wonder how often the game was play-tested without use of this rule.  Is the game better for it?  Or is a better simulation?  I doubt that both are better, but more plays are needed.

4) The time to teach this to a gaming group that does not have access to the rules, or needs someone to lead them through the muddle that are the rules, makes it more difficult and less practical to unlock the riches contained within the box.  Spending two hours to begin to make the garble less so is not a selling point, and makes me wonder if the "design team" interacted with other human beings during the design process, or simply stayed in their design cave, while ordering take-out the whole time.

Some much deserved praise:

1) The components, such as they are, are beautiful, but some of the cardboard counters tore when being punched out.  I have noticed this happening with GMT games the past year and a half or so, which makes me wonder what is happening with quality control.  It only happens to a few, but it used to happen to none.  Nevertheless, the map is a work of art, and if it is too small for some large battles, how else could it have been made?  But that's what the battle marking counters are for.

After five hours and four full turns...

If you're a fan of card-driven games, have an interest in the period, and can find three like-minded friends, this could be a blast.

Overall, the game seems to need more development. It's not a free-wheeling exercise in diplomacy and fighting in the way that Kingmaker and Warrior Knights can be. More more like carefully sequencing your hand of cards and min-maxing the opportunities they present—like a lot of other CDGs.

Of any card-driven game, this one offers players the most options in how they play their hand. It's possible to begin an operations phase with nine cards in your hand, several that are part of a unique set that belong to your faction, and any allied houses that you may have brought into play on a previous turn—a dozen cards or even more.

I can see experienced players knocking this out in six hours or even less. There's a bit of a learning curve, but CDG veterans will probably pick it up quicker than most.

RATING: 7
P500'd from GMT. A 2 to 4 player block game with elements of the chaos of Kingmaker, the fog of war of Hammer of the Scots, the CDG aspect of We the People, and a combat system akin to Commands and Colors. Couple this with 3 ways to win, plenty of opportunity for scheming and battling and 4 scenarios - I'm gonna love it.

RATING: 6.5
This card-driven game set in the War of the Roses period in Britain is, to me, yet another attempt to make a playable Kingmaker. After just one play I don't think this is it. Extremely long and gritty, this appears to be a Columbia "block game" coupled to the, by now, routine card-driven engine. Some of it reminds me of Warriors of God, other bits call forth War of the Roses: Lancaster vs. York. And, at times, it even reminds me a bit of Kingmaker - but not in a good way.

The victory conditions are a bit of an enigma. There is a simple Victory condition that is as easy to understand as it is difficult to accomplish, with a secondary condition that appears to come down to "economic points" which, despite the game definition, make no sense thematically. There is no "income" per se - the modes of exchange are votes and influence, none of which make any difference when it comes to toting up victory. But these obscure economic points are what seem to count for everything in the end.

As an aside, this really should be a strictly two player game where the fog-of-war blocks work as they should. How you would manage this practically in a four player game I just don't see as the map is too big to keep you from getting glimpses of some of your immediate neighbor's block faces - keeping the blocks face down may be a more practical approach but extremely prone to facing errors either accidental or deliberate.

I obviously need to read more of the rules for myself and play a lot more before I would begin to understand what the basic ideas are in this game as to what your various blocks should be on about. However, I have little to no desire to do either. It may well be that everything works the way it was designed; but, as pretty as a lot of it is, I can't recommend this game.

Quite unbelievable really. Did someone really think this was a playable game worthy of publication? It's thankfully been a while since GMT has done a truly spectacular misfire - PQ-17, 1805: Sea of Glory, Pursuit of Gory - but this qualifies, I think. It feels like the first revision of a game that would go on to become below-average with a couple years more development. Grossly over complicated, a mind-bogglingly obtuse rulebook, way too much time wasted in useless activity, obviously stupid victory conditions, and of excruciatingly painful length, there is basically nothing to like in here except the nice coats of arms.

Nicely produced game which initially looks like an all round improvement on Avalon Hill's Kingmaker. The map art is great and I like the different elements - War of the Roses topic, card-driven, battles resolved with dice, influencing nobles to join your side and the parliament phase to decide on the offices but altogether the gameplay is so stodgy it moves at a glacial pace (5 hours for 4 turns) and achieving the victory conditions seems too difficult given that everyone else can easily gang up to stop a potential winner. In a 3 or 4 player game no one will ever win by being 'elected' king five times. The resetting of nobles each turn adds time and means you are often doomed to repeat many of the same moves. Killing heirs is also very difficult as the battles are relatively bloodless. My rating would be much higher if this game were far quicker and less prone to the 'lets all work together to reign in the leader' type play.

GMT Games. Decent war of the roses war game.  This double blind game can be played multi-player and is best done so. This game uses blocks on a map of England.  The various lords and offices are present.  The game uses an interesting mechanism for bidding/voting for the various offices.  As to be expected, there is usually a lot of combat in the game and alliances are formed quite often.  This game is colorful and good looking.

A fairly ordinary area-control game made wider and heavier with no real gain.  You take ground only to lose it each round.  You gain influence only to fritter it away on silly auctions.  Honestly for all of the mechanisms bolted onto it (CDG, block game, dice combat, auctions, three different value tracks, influencing others units, negotiation) it actually didn't feel so overwhelming, just dreadfully slow and completely unnecessary.  No sense of progression or accomplishment or direction.  Everything seemed so pointless.  With rules explanation, three players played three turns in five hours.  I don't see how you could actually finish this or why you would ever choose it over El Grande.

A four player game takes about a turn per hour and lasts nine turns. This doesn't kill it for me, but the victory conditions do. After a couple of plays it seems to me that the economic victory points (area control) is the only realistic way to go. Getting voted in as king 5 times, or killing all the other heirs will only happen with some gullible opponents. The area control vps feels like a bit of a cop out for me, and encourages rather gamey tactics rather than he great political and historic conflict advertised on the box. This isn't a bad game, but its not great either.


---------------------------------

Played a two player game, lasted two turns and took 1.5 hours. It was good fun, quite a few rules checks, and possibly some mistakes but i've shunted the rating up to an 8 because i enjoyed it at least as much as Richard III even though all the political systems are obviously designed for 3 or 4 players. Even if all the players knew the rules well, i can't see a four player turn taking much less than 1 hour. Your going to play 5 cards each most of the time and then there's voting and quite a bit of book keeping, so a 9 turn game could take 9 hours if it went the full distance and no players were eliminated.


----------------

only played solo thus far. This game is block war game + CDG + Kingmaker, with a fair spread of chrome on top. I think there's a decent game here, but i wonder if more of the fat could have been cut. 

I also own Richard III by columbia. Im tempted to say that Richard III is a more rounded war game, but it abstracts the interesting politics of the war down to a few dice rolls, in crown of roses the kingmaker esc system really shines through. I'd also say Richard III is more prone to generating larger battles, and is for that reason probably more historic, despite its relative lack of chrome.

Multiplayer CDG and block war game in the same package. I was fashinated to get to know this game better, but unfortunately it takes too long time to play.

There are so many different overlapping mechanics in this game, nay, categories of mechanics, that it both intrigues me and daunts me.

You have to be comfortable with each of the following:

block wargames;
card-driven games;
wintering rules;
dice rolling for battle;
secret unit deployment;
voting and negotiation;
player-player diplomacy;
backstabbing;
area control;
etc.

I love all of those things, but this game is a beast.

That said, I've read that it blows other backstabbing area control games out of the water, and I don't doubt it. I need more time with Crown of Roses.

I don't really like block games (dislike the combat system - hitting on 4/5/6s, reducing a step for each hit - feels toooo much like Risk combat), but, still gave it a shot: interesting subject and a lots of stuff in the rules. In fact, on a first run through the rules, looked like there may be a very interesting game hidden somewhere within.

However, those rules proved to be a real problem (no index!!!, concepts with labels that are counter intuitive, poor organizations, etc.. When we finally got around to actually trying to play it, setup was a real challenge (no excuse for that). Usually, we don't care: we'll suffer through poor rules & setup for great game play and story. But, it took us a few hours just to get the point of moving blocks. And, then, it just didn't have any pop for my group. 

Bits and the board are not good for easily looking at the game and understanding what is going on. For example, the map uses a dark blue symbol for one player and black for neutral places; very hard to distinguish the two. Blocks here are also not worth the little extra in fog of war compared to how else FOW could have been simulated. 

Usual multiplayer problem of just feasting on the weak - and moving last in a turn - without any "checks"/diplomatic breaks (which are present in some great multiplayer wargames) on that process. MUCH too easy to flip alliances (no enforced peace, royal marriages, dynamics that restrict unrestrained diplomacy, etc).

It took us almost four hours to play through one turn (1.5 hr setup...huh?...2.5 hours first turn), and, we are VERY experienced waragmers.

Also, a problem with the Victory Conditions: no one is likely to be elected king 5 times as required - and it is very unlikely to kill off all the heirs. So, it becomes a race for VPs (controlling territory); with no penalty for not controlling your own territory. At the end of the turn, everyone goes home and you redeploy at beginning of next turn. So, a lack of tension.

A few good concepts in the rules: we really liked how various things generate Influence Points - that are then utilized to "buy" nobles thru an interesting blind binding process. And, there are other choices to spend IPs on. Very clever. Some of the cards are also interesting, but an absence of any card angst (for a card driven wargame). 

I really respect the overall effort behind the game design; lots of period history, "color" & story here. And, you can tell in the design that the designer wanted to reflect that (kudo's to the designer on that score). Sadly, the game (and thus experience) just weren't accessible to myself and my regular gaming group.

We'll probably play Kingmarker (haven't played it in a few decades - but got the bug now) before we ever give CoR a shot again. If only, the CoR team - actually GMT - (com'n gang!) would give us a how-to-play video, we would have been saved A LOT of pain.

Some interesting concepts and several mechanics (CDG, blocks, auctions) combined to create an unusual wargame with an euro feeling. Beautiful components.

Don't see how someone can win a Political Victory and Military victory seems tough too.

RATING: 7
Crown of Roses began as an attempt to update Kingmaker. But with the addition, among other things, of a card-driven mechanism and the use of blocks, it has become a very different game. It still retains and, indeed, increases the thematic elements of the older game. But it has also added complexity - perhaps a little too much - resulting in a lengthier game.   

Physically the game meets the usual GMT standards. A couple of the blocks were slightly misshaped, which shouldn't be a problem. But it would have been wise for GMT to include a small number of spare blocks. The rulebook is a monstrous 44 pages in length. This does not include the optional rules, which can be found at the beginning of the Playbook! Despite, or maybe because of, the lengthy explanations contained within there are still a number of rules ambiguities which even a few plays of the game does not fully resolve. It does not help that some concepts have two names. Many of the cards are also unclearly or inaccurately worded. FAQ and errata now exist but still do not resolve many issues, so that playing the game correctly still requires plenty of work consulting and interpreting the rules. 

I've played CoR as a 2, 3 and 4-player game, but have never managed more than 5 turns during 7-8 hours of playing! At least one game is necessary to get a grasp of how some of the rules work in practise - especially combat. I have doubts about the suitability of CoR for 2 players, as the player who has the King enjoys many advantages (determines player order in case of ties in OPS value of cards played, gets +5 votes, get an extra card etc.) With 3 or 4 players, the military and political interaction works well. But there are still significant problems: too much chrome for too little benefit (a good example is the use of depleted markers), the inescapable length of the game (all that set up during the Wintering Phase), and the fact that victory comes down to who has most Economic Points (also called Victory Points - nothing is streamlined in this game!), as both Military and Political victories are all but impossible. The focus on Economic Points means that players scramble to occupy shires loyal to other players while having little reason to defend shires loyal to themselves. 

I've played CoR with seven other players so far. Almost all of us have a similar opinion - CoR is a promising game that had not been properly developed, resulting in an interesting but unsatisfactory gaming experience.

After 3 1/2 games I revised my rating from 8 to 7 based on the continuing difficulty of navigating the Rules book. It is significantly revised, requiring a download of the the "living rules" from GMT, but it is now even bulkier and no better organized. A very thin index makes page flipping a requirement to find answers to the many issues that crop up. That said, for enthusiasts of the Wars of the Roses, it is still the most thorough treatment of the subject at the political and strategic level.

Crooked Roses.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This is a preliminary rating based on one four-player game. I did not fall in love with the game. Crown of Roses seems to be a nice game but it also feels messy, not polished at all. It is also a bit too abstract to my taste.

I really like the king phase and the offices, but I’m afraid that Crown of Roses is nothing but a simple area control game with a lot of chrome. I really hope this is not the case. The victory conditions are ridiculous. Killing your opponents' heirs is not feasible strategy at all. Yes, you can eliminate them in theory, but in practice there are too many heirs and killing them is too difficult. In a four-player game no one is going to achieve a political victory. Why others would vote someone to be a king for the fifth time (yes, five times in a game with nine turns) to win the game? 

I had high hopes for it but I sold it.

RATING: 5.75
Too long and complicated for what it offers.

Some interesting ideas in the way the nobles are bid on, but this adds more bookkeeping onto an already accounting-heavy game (as every new turn results in a complete re-setup of the board).

Rules leave some issues unanswered; which is surprising since they reach a whopping 44 pages... A lot for a CDG block game.

Playing time with 4 is going to easily clock in at 7-10 hours for a first play.

Players will also need to print out some support components which should have been supplied (map cards and a way to mark which blocks belong to whom, as the suggestion to just lay all the blocks down is quite an impractical band-aid solution).

A bold design that is ultimately bogged down by too much chrome and unclear player motivations (turtling encouraged by the game design itself).

RATING: 6
Rating after one play, 4-player, so this might change.  It took us 7 hours to complete 3 turns, as this was our first attempt.  I have some reservations about the game, which, while full of interesting ideas, does not, for me at least, achieve the potential sum of its diverse parts.  Beautiful to behold, it seems somewhat bloated, and there was little enthusiasm on the part of the other players to play it again soon.

RATING: 5.5
Based on one incomplete play: This is a mix of a card driven game (such as Twilight Struggle) and a block war game (such as Hammer of the Scots). You can also play up to four players and the fog of war works fairly well as each player can only see their blocks, but it is hard to tell which blocks belong to which of your opponents. Also, there is a lot of down time as the cards each have many possibilities. Such as most card driven games, you can play the card for its operation points or event or even hold it for later abilities. You also have specific cards to your faction. So there is a lot of down time, I would say maybe try it at 2 players first. At four, the game can easily last well over 5 hours.

There's a good game hiding somewhere under the half-cooked rules, strange victory conditions, and large amount of bookkeeping. Perhaps the v.2.0 rules bring it out, but I haven't managed to motivate myself to try them after very poor experiences with the original rules.

Skeptical about a 12-page rulebook given GMT's penchants. Yes, rulebook likely to be about 25 pages. Okay, make that 44. 

I wonder if this is what the designer had in mind. 

I'll soup up my Kingmaker instead.

Almost unplayable out-of-the-box due to a horrible manual and rules issues. The first go at it gave me a horrible headache. 
However, the variant rules go a long way to fix this. The combat and card driven mechanics are great fun. I prefer the VP-based optional rules for victory conditions. This is an ambitious game that combines many popular mechanics from other games like biddable player roles and block and card driven game play.

Two games now - one 3 and one 4 player. Victory conditions boil down to Economic points as killing heirs is very difficult and no-one will vote for someone to be King to win the game. Why bother fighting? Just spread out into other players counties and score your VP's. Going last in the final Impulse of a turn is sweet - scatter the biggest stack!
Too much hard work for a basic area control game. Love the theme but the mechanics are horribly over-complicated.  
No mounted mapboard - that's a shame!

This should be re-developed as a COIN game.

A very long and rather rules-heavy to me.  (We only finished 1 turn in about 3 or 4 hours.)  It might be a good option for 4 exact experienced wargamers though.  Additional colored tokens are really needed for the players in this game as all the blocks are the same color.

I find myself unable to rate this game because I cannot play it as it is intended: a [b]very long[/b], multi-player game.  Those just don't work for us.  We can do a medium length multi-player game, but the game doesn't include any such scenario.  We can do a long two-player game, but it doesn't work two-player, at least with the rules as written.  After three two-player games, we're still toying with the two-player rules to attempt to make it work.  Why are we trying so hard to make this work when we have shelves of other two-player wargames which don't need tweaking? Because:

1) This is the best implementation of combat in a block wargame I've seen, and I've been playing them since the 1980s.  You really have to try it - it's a lot of fun.  It pwns the A-B-C-D system, and I predict you'll see more of this style of combat in future block games. ([b]I rate this subsystem: 10[/b].)

2) The Influence Points system is excellent - it's used to win neutral (and even enemy) nobles over to your side, and also to bid for Offices in "auctions".  Lots of fun, well implemented, highly recommended. ([b]I rate this subsystem: 9[/b].)

3) The card system is largely excellent, and except for [i]Affairs of State[/i] (which I think needs some sort of house ruling), the cards are well thought out.  Each House having their own eight House Cards is also an excellent implementation, to stave off a turn of bad draws.  I like how the Surprise cards allow you to draw a replacement.  Allies are very flexible, something I'm very fond of in games. ([b]I rate this subsystem: 8[/b].)

4) The period of history is rich and interesting and we enjoy spending an afternoon immersed in it.

Now if we could just get the two-player game tweaked to where we like it!  After three two-player games, we've decided to scrap the Political Victory track.  While it's a necessary feature of the multi-player game (to make sure the King Office rotates among the players), it kills the two-player game.

A top result from the wargames maths trade 2015, rules read, just need to find a 4 player gathering to give it a play.  So far just 1 play and it wasn't great.  The design tries to cram way too much in and results in a bloated game that is need of streamlining.  Getting through a full game would require a time commitment that I cant make.  Its a shame as there does look to be a good game in this one.

It is ambitious, incorporating blocks, cards, bidding, area influence and dice based combat/interceptions/evasion. It is slow, awkward, incredibly overladen with unnecesary chrome, and has a bad rulebook. The kernel of a great game is there, but it would need a huge overhaul to get me back to the table with that one. Which is a shame, because a cdg/blockgame on the Wars of the Roses could be a beautiful thing.

The game has many strong suits:
- the artwork is great (the board is one of the most beautiful I have seen and deserve to be framed);
- the stickers for the blocks are really well done, with all the necessary information being clear to see;
- the way to put the blocks turned for you, may seem to be weird at first, but it worked like a charm for us;
- the cards makes sense inside the theme;
- there is a good deal of table talk, since deals can be made for many things.

But it has also many issues:
- the looooooong gameplay - with four, every round takes about 1 hour, but if you add the re-deployment of the nobles, it can take even more. Our 3 round game took 4+ hours;
- the kingmaking. Now this is the deal breaker. In a game that is this long, how can you justify that someone else decides the game for you? Sure, maybe this has historical roots, but in a game that can take 10 hours from you I just can't manage to accept. But this is politics, you can say. You should made people like you so that they don't turn on you when necessary. Ok, fair enough. But nothing is stopping someone to be "hurt" by something minor you did 6 rounds ago, even though from that point on you have been a great "friend" and someone else is making that player life miserable in the game ever since. Anyway, I'm not at all a fan of kingmaking. And in a game this long is unacceptable for me.

Picked up this game in lieu of kingmaker. I play solo, so in essence my review of this game may not give it justice. I think it will be much more immersive with team play. More of a political than a war simulation. Did not like the combat approach in block games (die-rolls). Components are top-notch.

This started as a revamp of the old (and awful) Avalon Hill [gameid=987].  Unfortunately, the designers and developers opted for the kitchen-sink approach.  Card-driven?  Sure!  Blocks?  Why not!  Negotiation?  Absolutely!  Tactical combat?  Of course!  Picking one or two of these approaches would have made for a heavy, but manageable game.  Using all of them makes this one of the most rule-heavy wargames GMT has put out, and the playtime and rules overhead suffers accordingly.

Even GMT seems to have realized they overreached with this title.  The Living Rules and Living Playbook underwent the most thorough rewrite I've ever seen, including the complete revision of the victory conditions and a suggestion for a whole new quick-play mode to try to cut the time down.  Both of these improve the game, but it's still not enough to save it.

It's a shame, because there are lots of wonderful touches here.  The components are great, with beautiful art that pops, heraldry that is nice and bright, and wonderfully thick blocks and cards.  Even the systems themselves are all pretty good in isolation.  I see aspects of my favorite titles all over the rules, but even superb individual mechanics are not enough to support the overly ornamented whole.

The whole thing smacks of trying to please too many audiences. Not only do you have mechanic soup, but it also attempts to be both a two player duel and a four-player free-for-all.  Some mechanics are great for two players and bad for four, like the minigame for tactical combat.  Other rules are great for four players and flat for two, like bidding for influence on offices.  In the end, nobody's happy.

I suppose this is better than the old Kingmaker, but that has more to do with the drivel that is the old Kingmaker than any positives in this game.  GMT has traded one set of problems for another.  If you want to explore the feel of combat and politics in the era and are willing to sacrifice the specific historical setting for a more generic one, try [gameid=22038].

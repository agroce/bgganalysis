This game is fantastic.  A quick, fun, cutthroat game that has wonderful mechanics and an excellent theme.  Remembering where your high point value members are adds an element of memory that makes it a bluffing game a well, though it is equally fun to ignore that aspect of placement and just scramble to get as many as possible to safety.  

Truly a game that should appeal to everybody--definitely give this one a try if you have not played it before, no matter what your favorite type of game is.

This game is a ton of fun. You can play it with your family and young kids and its a great experience, or you can play it with the guys and have a lot of cutthroat play and hilarious shenanigans. The game overall has really simple mechanics but at the same time there can be a lot of thought and strategy into your next and future moves. Everyone I've played this with has absolutely loved it.

RATING: 8.5
Mass hysteria. An incredibly simple and organic experience, pitting players against a crumbling island surrounded by sharks, whales, and sea monsters. These survivors can be ruthless, though, as they are given the opportunity for control over these predators.

The beauty of this game is the lack of complexity. It's an outwit and out-move situation, but it is also a game of social negotiation and memory. Every little survivor is worth a secret amount of points. Players can only view the amounts of their own survivors at the beginning of the game, as they are setting them out on the board. After that, you better remember who your valuable survivors are and get them to safety! You may have to team up with an opponent, offering help to their survivors in exchange for safe passage of your own or perhaps a little mercy from the movement of sharks. 

Survive plays quick, with an emphasis on laughter, tension, and shouting. Lots and lots of shouting! Be careful who you play this with, because if they can't handle a bit of the cutthroat, it may not go over so well. For all others, this is one of those games that brings friendly competition and laughs every minute.

RATING: 6
1 play / 6 players

LIKE: Flipping tiles and sinking the island is fun. Moving the sea serpent is fun.
DISLIKE: Very attack-oriented game, but it's fast and furious. Not much strategy.

OVERALL: This is a fun romp that I used to play as a kid. The new edition has nice tiles. It is a bit rough as a game, but it is not meant to be taken seriously.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This is very simple - so that makes it a family game, even younger one could play it. It is seriously luck based too - nearly zero strategy - but somehow I still enjoy it. I do like the back-stabby aspects quite a bit. And plays fast - so that makes the pain more painless. The production is good (all the wood bits are well done) - but the graphic design is bad. No regrets owning it and will very likely get it back to the table again (or may just as likely trade it away).

Simple pero entretenido y muy divertido, perfecto para jugar con los sobrinos :) Buena edición del clásico, aunque podrían haber metido también los pulpos (Exp. de 5€ más). Hay barata miniexpansion para 5-6 jugadores, pero cogiendo meeples del carcasonne sirven si se juega la versión sin puntuaciones bajo ellos.

RATING: 5
Survive is a tactical game with so much chaos around you that there is really no point trying to devise any grand strategies. Of course, it is better to have some kind of a plan but essentially you just play the move that fits the situation at hand.

There is a clear dramatic arc in the game, which is nice. The island is sinking, people get killed while some survive but the game inevitably comes to an end. 

I also feel compelled to compare Survive with the game it reimplements (Escape from Atlantis). Personally I find the latter more exciting with beautiful 3D components. The rule changes are for the worse, as well. First of all, having meeples of different (secret) VP value makes it much harder to see who is winning. Basically this just introduces more uncontrollable elements to a game that is very chaotic already. This is maybe the biggest bad change. Moreover, the more restricted movement of sea creatures is a change that is very euro in nature. I prefer the rule of the original that with some (bad) luck creatures can occasionally jump to any free space. This creates more excitement since you are not guaranteed to reach safety at any point. Ok, first I am complaining about introducing more chaos and then I want to have more. However, the two things work in a very different way. The first one is totally out of control while the latter depends on players' choices.

Anyways, not a bad game but having played the original, I'll stick to it.

RATING: 7
Ameritrash at its best. You are a tribe of meeples on Atlantis that is in the process of sinking into the ocean. You want to get on boats and or swim, (swimming is a last resort believe me) off the doomed island and to shore of another continent. Certain of your meeples are worth more points than others but you won't know if you don't remember after placement, and they will be competing with other meeple tribes for the scarce boats. On your turn you take another piece of the island away, which usually involves making someone's meeple/s take a bath, and trigger or hold onto a special power. Then you move your meeples and boats and roll a die. This leads to you moving whales that destroy boats, Sharks that eat meeples in the ocean, and monsters that destroy boats and eat meeples. So, the game isn't a coop is what I am saying. As long as everyone is a good sport, than this game plays like a wonderful scramble for safety where a lot of take that and mayhem occurs. Beware playing with happy cooperative people, it breaks the game.

I gave this one to my friend for Christmas.  An awesome new edition of a fun, old-school, cutthroat game.  Still as fun as I remember!

Update: Tweaking this one down a little bit since the last rating.  I find myself hesitant to bring it out when it's suggested.

Update: Tweaking down again to a 5.  Was it just nostalgia that made me excited for this one?  I find myself very reluctant to get involved in a game of this when it's proposed.

RATING: 7.5
First play was with 3, and was lots of fun. I can see this one being played very regularly, my group just likes to mess with each other for this one to stay on the shelf much. Hoping that the new expansion will actually work with my old board, because the only thing that would make this one much better would be the ability to play with 5 or 6.

6-12-11 - Again with 3, and again very fun. In fact, the person who started out being eaten left and right ended up winning - we eased up on him and tried to take each other out brutally, and the ones he lost were all of low value, so he snuck out a win. Lots of fun, and definitely will be playing again soon.

Wanting to trade my older 1980 copy. Box has a lot of wear, but the components are still in good shape.

This is a perfect game for a heterogenous mix of ages/tastes.  It's simple enough that new gamers and young children can have fun, yet has enough player interaction and hidden information to give experienced gamers a surprising amount of depth and competition. It's not necessarily *balanced* between casual and tactical players, but they will at least both have a blast.

Ok, I have mixed feelings for this one. The game play and flow is simple and fun, but the luck factor of this game turns it in a very big chaos and it is very difficult to make a good strategy. Anyway, a fun game and I would play again if invited, but won't ask for it.

It is very, very entertaining, and for a multiplayer 'conflict' game, the hidden values of the meeples dilutes any kingmaking. 

Of course, the same valuing system can lead to very random events, but given those events are people being eaten by sea monsters or thrown from boats it is hilarious regardless.

Definitely not a two player game - it would probably be better with 3 or 4. Tons of luck, but very well done with cute monster-eeples, easy-to-understand rules, and iconic information on tiles. I can see how this would be good in a family setting. Unique game play and design. A keeper! UPDATE: Played this twice with 4 players - tons of fun! But there is luck involved with the tile pick ups, especially since the "moving the sea monster", "swimmers moving 3 spaces", and "boats moving 3 spaces" are much more powerful than the other tiles. 2015 UPDATE: Fond memories of some very good games, so rating stays as is.

Really wanted to like this one. It's not bad, it's just... bleh. You might think you control your actions, but it really comes down to dumb luck. Who will draw the right tile at the right moment (answer: my girlfriend), and who will obtain what he wants when rolling the die. The components are nice, though (although the whales should have been a different color, they kinda blend in, and the numbers under the blue meeples are hard to read). I don't know why Stronghold Games didn't make a multilingual edition, since the components are language-independent.

The theme is interesting. Our island is slowly sinking so we put our people on boats and sail to safety. Meanwhile there are sea mmonsters, sharks and whales that other players can use to 'help' you. This game offers a nice combination of skill luck and fun. Plays in about an hour with 4 players.

RATING: 8.1
I had my eye on this for a while, and it has lived up to all of my expectations!  I am not at all surprised this is a classic.

The one negative I can think of is that there is a fair amount of luck involved.  Some players will flip over more beneficial tiles, experience better creature die rolls, etc.  The luck involved does affect my rating, but only slightly.

On the other hand, there are many positives to mention.  The variable setup is definitely a plus.  More than likely, you will start with a unique island every time.  I also like the variable ending, insofar as you don't know exactly when the volcano tile--which triggers the end of the game immediately--will be drawn.

One of the major points on the plus side for this game are the short turns.  This broadens the potential player pool for this game considerably, and makes it a great selection as a "gateway game."  It also renders it a family game, so long as you are OK with the somewhat violent theme (people are constantly dying, after all).  You will "get the game" halfway through your first game, and start playing very fast turns.  The game plays in 45 minutes, as advertised.

Finally, I find the theme appealing.  Yes, people are dying left and right, but trying to get your people to safety whilst avoiding numerous hazards is quite thrilling.  And the mechanics do fit the theme, to be sure!  For example, if you're flailing about in the sea, you have to spend an action (you get 3 per turn) to climb into a boat, onto adjacent land, etc.

In conclusion, I really like this game and can recommend it to almost everyone; I have a feeling this will get a lot of table time in my house.

Excellent, quick and light game that I've only ever managed to play with 5 or 6 players (with the mini-expansion). I think it's a brilliant game. It's dicky but not too dicky as often you have relatively few options when you roll the shark/whale/monster dice.

The components - particularly the hexes of different height - are fantastic and the game feels thematic. Things escalate quickly.

A game I feel I can easily pull out with non-gamers and ensure they have a blast as they eat eachother's swimmers and destroy one another's boats.

Oh wow, where to start with this one? After one play with two players, I have to say this is one of my favorite games right now. With only two survivors, I was on the receiving end of a lot of attacks in my first game and I can't wait to play again! Hopefully next time I'll be the one dishing out all of the attacks! I can see this game being a blast with four, and with six players it'll be pure chaos! 

I'm very happy I received this game as a gift! :)

My first impressions of this game are good.  It's incredibly simple to play, and generally fun while playing.  I feel a wanton for a deeper level of strategy, and maybe that will surface in time, but for now ...

RATING: 9
A very fun family game with tremendous appeal.  Features a very simple yet thoughtful ruleset; allowing players to quickly and easily understand how to both play and strategize.  The components are all beautiful, with cool meeples and well designed tiles (particularly in the easy to understand symbols).  Only gripe I have however is that my copy came with some marked meeples, but I have contacted Stronghold Games and do expect that they will make good soon enough.  Survive! plays very fast with times fluctuating between 30 to 60 minutes (with most games finishing well under an hour).

All in all what do you have with this?

(1) A great theme (to bring in the family, non-gamers and kiddies), 
(2) simple, deep rules (easily allowing clever play), 
(3) fantastic components, 
(4) and all of this combines into a tremendous game played best with the full accompaniment of four.  Get it!

Update: Stronghold Games did indeed make good on my component request, swiftly sending me in the meeples I requested.  Thank you!

In Erinnerung an [thing=2653]Die Flucht von Atlantis[/thing].
Das Review Video von [geekurl=/user/UndeadViking]UndeadViking[/geekurl] hat mich auf dieses Spiel bzw. diese Neuauflage aufmerksam gemacht. Diese Neuauflage ist mit dem Spielbrett und den dicken Inselteilen einladender zum Spielen als die Plastikinselteile aus den 80ern.
Aber es gibt doch einen Unterschied zu der etwas teurerer Version mit dem Namen: Survie: Escape from Atlantis. In der Umsetzung von The Island fehlen die Delphine (inklusive der damit verbundenen Karten.
Also bei einem erneutem Neukauf würde ich daher direkt zu der Version von Survive greifen.
Ich kann mir jedoch mit den Plastikfiguren aus dem Original Spiel aus den 80ern helfen. Diese alten Plastik Figuren sind eigentlich doch sehr schön (eigentlich doch schöner als die neuen Holzfiguren aus The Island).
Zur Steuerung der Riesen Kalmare und der Delphine haben ich dann die benötigten Würfel (D6 und D8 selber angepasst).  
Die Regeln in Deutsch gibt es beim Hersteller als PDF.

The decades roll on by, but Survive! has lost very little of its nasty luster. You can find DNA from this game in anything from Pirateer to Forbidden Island, not to mention a large number of tile placement titles. Nothing here but mean spirited fun. Oh, what fun. I have actually never experienced the expansions, but will do so once they are released in the all-in-one expansion this Fall (2015). The new version looks good and really pops out to anyone who hasn't tried one of its earlier incarnations.

Nasty little game of extreme screwage.  When competitive adults are involved keep kids out of this game or they will be permanently scarred.  Make that island tile disappear, drop the other players piece into the ocean and let the sharks get him, haha!  We laugh all the way through this, especially if someone complains that we're picking on him.

Downfall of Pompeii has a similar theme, but plays very different.  Survive! is very much an AmeriTrash game, while Downfall of Pompeii plays like a Euro, and is much less random

Plays best with 4

The stronghold version has great production quality.  No more thin cardboard pieces.  The lifeboats in particular are great.  However if you get the Stronghold version, I'd really recommend purchasing the 5-6 player expansion for the replacement meeples and hexes, which take care of some issues in the original.

A fun and light game. Had a bit of trouble actually getting my group to send the monsters after each other.
Had to start it of and took out a couple of boats containing one of each of my opponents. After my destruction of a few boats, they seemed to get an idea of how the game should be played, and started to do the same... to me... only. LOL! 

The game ended in a tie between two players. I think they will play a bit more aggressively the next time around, now that they've understood that it's a lighthearted game.
Considering introducing this game to my family the next time I get the chance.

For a game that was first published in 1982, it's quite amazing that it manages to compete against more modern titles. Undoubtedly, this stems from a very clean design, which has mechanics that mesh well with the theme and that allow for some interesting strategic choices. 

But despite appreciating the design, this game can be quite confrontational. Granted, some of the "meanness" can be mitigated by understanding the importance of coupling your meeples with your opponent meeples, in order to "piggy-back." But it still requires a certain mindset/playing-style to enjoy. 

The component quality of the 30th anniversary is absolutely amazing. Stronghold Games really knocked it out of the park with this release.

My original rating was 8, I've reduced it because where the rules should be explicit, they are ambiguous. Why is writing clear rules so difficult? I'm still not sure how many spaces an empty or full boat can move on your turn.

Jópofa játék, aminek tényleg csak akkor van értelme, ha merünk és akarunk abszolút gátlástalanul konfrontálódni. Ennek megfelelően totális káosz tud kialakulni a táblán. A lényeg, hogy a süllyedő Atlantisról kell elmenekülni és úszva vagy csónakon partot érni a 10-10 emberünk közül minél többel (és lehetőleg az értékesebbekkel)... Az eltűnő lapkák mind valami meglepetést rejtenek.... A cápával meg lehet etetni az úszó embereket, a bálna felborítja a csónakot, a sárkány egyszerre csinálja mindkettőt. Az örvény pedig mindent visz (hogy a játékvégi vulkánról ne is beszéljünk). Ez egy nagyon szuper játék ...lett volna mondjuk 8-10 éves koromban, de nem emlékszem, hogy itthon akkor elérhető lett volna.
Hogy miért adtam ilyen kevés pontot rá? Mert ez nem az a játék, amivel mai fejjel túl sűrűn leülnék játszani, egyszerűen nem üti meg a mai jóféle felnőtt játékok szintjét. Sőt családiakból is sokkal jobbak vannak. Csak a túláradó nosztalgiahullámmal tudom magyarázni a játék irreálisan előkelő helyét a BGG-n.
Ennek ellenére örülök, hogy kipróbálhattam, kíváncsi voltam, mire föl ez a nagy felhajtás a játék körül...

It is essentially the same game as "Escape from Atlantis", and the modifications are not the key to enjoy the game or not.  Components of the older version were nicer, in my opinion.
Very simple but terribly funny game because you continuously kill people. Pompeii seems to be based in the same idea. It is a racing game trying to save your people from Atlantis sinking, but beware of all the dangers in the sea: octopus, dragons, sharks... Just a feast to laugh at other's disgraces

The game is so full of tense decisions, screwage potential and gotcha moments, that everyone I've intyroduced this to has loved it. A great family or friends game due to its simplicity.

Atlantis' flagship mechanic is, without doubt, Take That. This game is all about smashing your opponents while attempting to slip a couple of your guys past their radar. It's simple, easy to understand, and actually quite fun. More fun than being eaten by sharks at least. I'd appreciate a bit more control, but this game really isn't about meticulously strategizing your moves. An additional downside is that the game has a tendency of fizzling out towards the end, with all the important moves having been done in the first few rounds.

When I was a kid, I used to play a friend's copy of Editrice Giochi's "Si Salvi Chi Può!" and I have fond memories of the few sessions... So I jumped with both feet on Stronghold Games' reprint.
When I finally brought it to the table, I was a little worried: would it sink my kid's memories?
Well, the asnwer is NO!
It is certainly a family game, but is quick, fast, chaotic, and FUN!
The production is gorgeous, and now I am a happy owner of Survive, looking for many more plays...

I recently got the 30th anniversary edition, and I LOVE THIS GAME!! Its good with any number of players (I also got the 5-6 player expansion)  and it just feels SO personal, in a 3+ player game going after someone's meeples, or flipping their boat etc... GREAT game!!! TONS of fun and reply value!  My group LOVES IT

Initial Impressions: I remember playing this game back in the 80's. This game is great for families but it can really be played cutthroat. Quick makeshift alliances, begging and pleading are all useful tools in order to get your people to safety. The components in this edition are beautiful and well worth the price of the game. We always use the dolphin option when we play. This makes for a wonderful gateway game.

10 Plays: Still as fun as ever, the kids are embracing the cut-throat tactics in the game without any hard feelings. My kids are also comfortable introducing their friends to the game. This is a keeper for our collection and I can see us playing for many years to come.

A game that the people I introduce it to seem to like more than me.  A couple of my friends have bought it right after I showed it to them, and most others seemed to enjoy it.  But it is a bit too chaotic for me and lasts about 30 minutes too long for a game with this much chaos.

Complete, save for the original rule set.  Rule set included is printed out from BGG.  All parts, tiles, boats, swimmers, and monsters are present and accounted for.  In fact, I may have a few extra:  the box list of pieces state only 5 whales and 5 sea monsters, while this copy has 6 whales and 7 sea monsters. Box shows shelf wear and minor tape damage, but it holds an awesome game that is fun to play with family or friends.

A very light filler of a game in a big box with excellently produced bits (I have the 2010 Stronghold version). Rules are intuitive and very simple. Lots of variants to spice things up and lots of screwage. The randomness of the action under each tile is a step of chaos further than I usually like to go but its fast and dirty, great fun and all over in 30 odd minutes so earns a place on my shelves as a sorbet.

This game is loads of fun.  You need to understand going in that this game is more about the experience than winning.  There is a lot of luck in what tiles are revealed when and in what gets rolled, but I do not play this game cutthroat or with deep strategy (it isn't here).  But what this game does have is lots of fun interaction and eating each other with sharks and sea monsters!  It is also a great game to introduce new people too, straight forward rules and engaging game play in less than an hour game play.

Really fun, really mean family weight game. The goal is simple: have the most of your explorers escape the sinking island of Atlantis to reach safe shores. But in addition to your pieces, you get to move ocean creatures around the board to eat other players' explorers! Great fun with a few good friends and a few good drinks.

I did not know of this game in the 1980's... I was taught to play it in 2007, after learning to like Euro games. This game, however, has the same feel as today's Euros. Hard to believe Parker Bros. had such a nice game and barely ran the production of it. No wonder this game achieves an excellent resale value. I'd love to see a re-release of this game, all modernized for the 21st century with quality components. Oh my, my!!! The game was re-released in 2010 and I have bought a copy. Great job Stronghold!!!

I very much enjoy this brutal, yet easy to play, game.  Though there is certainly luck involved, I really feel like I am trying to beat the people around me while not making them overly vexed at me as to avoid thier wrath come thier turn.  I love the psychological elements of the game.  This is a fun one that I can play with most crowds, including my gamer friends, who greatly enjoy eating my meeples with sharks and sea monsters no matter how much they also enjoy other, deeper games.

Really enjoyed this game.  Great game to introduce to people who are familiar with Catan as an alternative.  The game has an enjoyable light hearted screw your friends vibe, which is more direct than the passive aggressive Euro style.  The game continuously works towards an end which is another benefit as it prevents games from dragging on.

Update: This is my roommate's and I go to cutthroat game.  Enjoy playing it when having competitive people over, picked up the expansion as well

This is a great family game, cutthroat, vindictive, hilarious and silly. Try to ship your people off the exploding island to safety, and watch as someone else pushes a whale into the boat and leaves them swimming in shark-infested waters. Don't worry, they'll pay for it next turn. I'm not sure how much strategy you can really employ when all your best-laid plans can be swallowed up by a sea serpent on someone else's turn, but it's good fun all the same.

mix this game up a bit. place the island hex cards in different places, for instance, place the island on one side of the board, players have to get to the 2 islands on the other side.

make up cards for the game. things such as "kick another player off boat", "move a piece of the island one space"
players get a card if they make a "kill" during their turn.

Great take that game where an island sinks and everybody has to get to the safety of the surrounding islands. Players are messing with each other all the time by sending sharks after swimmers, whales after boats or sea serpents to eat anything that makes the mistake of coming to close. Game is light and fairly random. But there still is a fair bit of clever movement and tile management required from the players. Great fun with children.

I can see why this game would have been a classic back in the 80s, because it broke from the traditional roll-and-move mold that was so prevalent. The way the game works is great because it almost demands some cooperation, and yet you're cooperating with the same people who will eat your people with a sea serpent or shark 2 turns later. The hidden points also lend a good amount of drama because you never know who exactly is winning until the final scores are tallied. I always feel the need to preface this game as one where "you have to be comfortable with being mean and nasty to each other" and that can turn off some players. Yet somehow the group that has embraced this game the most is my family, and they have requested it often. The biggest downside to the game is the length, because it can sometimes drag out a bit longer than necessary, especially when played with slow thinkers. I also think a lot of the variant rules are unnecessary and don’t add much to the experience. This is kind of a bummer because people see the dolphins and want to play with them, but they add some unnecessary confusion to the game. However these complaints are minor compared to the fun we have playing the game.

I remember playing and loving Survive! as a kid.  Around 1998, I decided to get another copy of it and found one on e-bay that was complete and in good enough shape.  It's got a take that feel to it and everyone I play it with likes the theme and enjoys the game.  Get your people off the sinking island and over to one of the safe islands without being eaten by a shark or sea serpent.  I still always enjoy this game today whenever I play it... not often, but often enough.

I've played the new Stronghold version and it's great too.  I like the differing heights of the land tiles.  Stronghold did a great job of putting together nice bits while maintaining the goodness of the original.

This game is all about negative interactions. You want to escape the island with as much meeples as you can and you want to do everything you can to prevent others to do so. Luckily there are sharks, whales and sea monsters to help! The 30th anniversary edition is beautiful and it's a lot of fun to play.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
New gamer friendly... easy mechanics, easy to explain, and potentially hilarious.

The gameplay is mediocre with some odd design aspects. For example, whales and sharks don't populate until their tiles are revealed; thus as the island disappears, more creatures fill the board. So there is a huge advantage (and sometimes this determines the winner) for those who rush to safety in the beginning. 

A story...
My friend loaded up his boat with 3 people. Before his next turn, a whale had been revealed and moved to destroy the boat. Using another boat in a rescue operation, he managed to move the whale and get the boat into the same hex as the original 3 people. By his third turn, another whale was revealed and destroyed his second boat. Having 4 people in one hex off of the beach, we all laughed at what looked like a spring break party. Then someone revealed a whirlpool and wiped out everything. Obviously, he spent the rest of the game vowing retribution. 

This game is a strategically-vacant killing spree of unpreventable scenarios. It is truly a game of survival, I just wish that surviving was less random.

RATING: 8
Waddington's classic family board game sadly long out of print (North American version made around the same time by Parker Bros was remodeled and called "Survive"). A remote island with an active, threatening volcano is also slowly sinking into the ocean. Ten "people" in four different player colours are stranded on the island trying to escape by either swimming or commandeering several small boats scattered about the coast.

Players take turns moving their people/boats then removing a tile (reflecting the erosion of the island), starting with sand, then jungle, and finally the rocky areas (beneath one of which is the symbol of the volcano erupting which ends the game). Finally the player rolls a special die which has faces representing either a shark, whale or sea-serpent and can move the figure rolled, if there is one available, to plague the opponents. Each tile removed has a back-printed symbol adding more sea creatures to the board, or more boats, or may become an "event card" to be played later by the player to aid in moving his people or killing marauding sea creature.

The game is relatively simple and while listed as being for ages "eight and up" can be played and enjoyed by younger children as long as an older person is available to provide some coaching. It is very enjoyable for all ages and provides some delicious tension as the island gets smaller and smaller, more sea creatures roam about the struggling survivors and the threat of the volcano looms ever closer. Why no-one has seen fit to reprint this gem remains a mystery!
++++++
Mystery no more! It's back and with a brand new suit of clothes. Not as three dimensional as the original Waddington version but very nice compared to the Parker Bros entry. No need to re-write any of the rules - this enduring classic is fun for all ages - we've been using it lately as a session ending filler.

MEAN.  You are going to kill someone else starting on the first turn, and you are going to keep doing that every turn until the game ends.  Some room for negotiation/deals like you'd have with Munchkin/Cutthroat Caverns/Cosmic, but plays faster, meaner, and the production Stronghold put out with the different sized tiles, good plastic boats/monsters/meeples make me suggest this every time over the others.

Rating is based on the "Waddington" version (3D island pieces, die with 3 dolphins on it, and people-shaped bits), as played a few times.  Current impressions:  cool-looking bits, fun game, but somewhat random.  Annoyances:  the people bits are quite unstable (a big deal in a fiddly game like this), the rules are vague on some issues, whirlpool action seems to make the game really random, the monster die comes up "dolphin" a lot more than necessary, and the hexes are too small for the size of of the bits that are supposed to fit in them (particularly in combination).  This is one of the games I am keeping because other people in my life enjoy playing them.  I'd be just fine if I never played this one again.  Bash the leader problem, big advantage to the start player, too long for what it is, very chaotic.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
First play: This went over very well with the 3 others I played with.  Easy to teach, with simple mechanics, but it quickly became clear that there's more to this game than first appears.  The game encourages confrontation, since you have to do something with those sea monsters and sharks you keep rolling, but it's also light enough that it's hard to feel too bad when your guy is gobbled by a shark.  

First impression is that this hits the sweet spot of being quite accessible to non-gamers (who make up the bulk of my opponents), but having enough depth to be fun for me too.  I like it.

Second play: 2er.  Significantly less interesting than the 4er game.  I didn't think more control could hurt a game, but it does here.  Half the excitement is wondering what's going to happen between turns.  It's also decidedly more vicious with 2, and not in a good way.

A fine fear-fest with just a hint of cooperative play (via the boats)--and great little plastic bits--whales, sharks and sea monsters!

Eating each other with sharks and sea serpents, not to mention flipping over boatloads of island escapees.  Doesn't get much better for me.

This is a fun game. While the strategy is pretty minimal and you can't fairly compare it fairness/balance wise to most modern euros, everything about this game is just fun and intuitive. The walking, swimming, whale/shark rules all sort of make sense, which helps make the game flow pretty well.

Also, it's just a ton of fun to turn over a whirlpool tile that kills everyone else's helpless people, who have just been tossed out of their boats by a whale. There's also nothing quite like watching another player's people slowly getting surrounded by whales and sea serpents, and the sense of dread that there's just no way that they're going to make it...

It is certainly very luck heavy -- in my first play I received zero tiles that help movement, and ended up with a score of 0, and the winner received a ton of those tiles. So as long as you go in for the entertaining carnage / survivor experience and not a strategy game you won't be disappointed.  The new edition board is also gorgeous.

Initial rating an 8. I'd potentially rate it even higher, except for the overwhelming luck involved and the fact that it is slightly on the long side for this type of game.

Its the type of game that is a chaotic fun when played with max players in slightly drunken condition, and specially for the first time. The game however is not very deep, and rewards blind risk - you can be a runaway leader with everything set up just perfectly, and suddenly lose. Its fun, but only the first couple of times. The game is not very deep and takes a while to play, so except occasional party gathering won't see much love from me.

RATING: 10
It's hard to put into words why this is so fun - it's just a simple, heated, well-designed game. It feels like it has a pretty good balance between strategy (moving through action points, spending your hand tiles) and luck (land tiles, dice.) The pacing is swift and spot-on.

I can't imagine this being as good with less than four... having EVERY land space filled from the beginning is awesome.

This game can be pretty mean, but in a hilarious way (who doesn't think tossing a sea monsters at your friends is funny?) and since everyone is CONSTANTLY doing something "bad" it's not that big a deal when you have some dudes eaten.

Oh, it's also a perfect length. Long enough to be satisfying while short enough that the "one more play" impulse is pretty strong. Good stuff!

Update: Fuck it, Survive, you've earned your 10. Every time I bust you out I have a blast, and when it's over I think to myself that there are few ways to spend your hour that are equally laugh-filled and fun.

Update the Second: It seems silly, but I upgraded from the third Stronghold edition to the 30th anniversary one via a trade. My meeples had worn to illegibility, and it really is one of my favorite games. Gonna gift the third away to a family member so I can always play it when visiting!

RATING: 7
Have not played it since logging plays on BGG but, many plays from my youth earn it my high regard as one of the earliest and best euro-type game experiences.

Update: Now I have played it as an adult and many other designs have caught up and surpassed it.  It was way ahead of its time in 1983 but 29 years have dulled the thrill.

A very funny "take that" game! You are trying to rescue your own meeples while at the same time trying to eat and kill the other players' - great fun! It's fast, tactical, a bit luck-based and especially highly interactive which just makes this game a winner with the right crowd! Always many laughs and curses when playing this, and it's funny to try to convince others not to kill you but the other players... This game belongs in almost every gamer's collection!

A friend of mine had this back in the 80's. I have fond memories of the pieces and having a good time.. but no recollection of the board/tiles. Odd that. And since I must have been in my early teens, there was no alcohol (that I will admit to) involved in my memory blockage.

This game is just pure fun.  I am willingly to play this most of the time because it is so short, but there is quite a bit of chance involved.  We're going to turn this into a drinking game to fill our sessions when we don't want to play a more involved game like Eclipse or Space Empires 4X.

RATING: 6
Survive was one of my favorite games from my childhood. I even still remember the TV commercial and theme song for it. I was lucky enough to receive the updated version as a gift.

This game was genius back in the day, and it has stood the test of time fairly well. It's certainly random, but not much more than other gateway options. What makes this game so darn fun is the theme and the "take that" nature of play. With two, I'm thinking it's probably best to play two colors with each player. There's not enough risk and press your luck with only two player colors. 

The new edition is very attractive. My only two gripes are 1) the numbers are hard to read on the blue meeples and 2) the backs of certain rock tiles punched out with a white border, which stinks when one supposedly random tile ends the game. On the other hand, I admire that the reprint includes tweaks past the original version, with dolphins, new dice, etc. Throw in the squid expansion, and there's a lot of ways to customize this fun little game to your liking. 

Update: 2nd play, this time with the dolphins on the board. It wasn't as bloody as I expected, as the die tended to produce boat and dolphin movement, which balanced out a three hex movement from a swimmer-chomping-sea-serpent. This is probably the better way to play.

[b]key update[/b]: A major "kudos" for Stronghold Games. Unprompted, Stronghold reached out to me regarding the misprinted rock tiles. They must have been perusing user comments (!!!) and actively sought out the few people that received games with this misprint, offering a free replacement. I'm flabbergasted! This type of superior customer service is fantastic. Bravo Stronghold!

...and final update: traded this away along with the 5-6 player expansion for the Claustrophobia: De Profundis expansion. I had a lot of nostalgia for this game, but with a handful of plays under my belt, it started to show its age a bit. It's a good game, and surprisingly good for its time, but I didn't need to own this one. The nostalgia hid some of the game's minor flaws. For me, the biggest flaw is that the endgame is not terribly exciting, as people have mostly reached the outer islands (or their guys are dead), and it's just waiting to draw that last tile. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A classic secret deployment game that truly stands the test of time. You have to get your meeples off the sinking island in the center of the board to one of the small docks at each of the corners. Of course you have all sorts of sea creatures chasing you and your opponents trying to get their meeples to the docks ahead of yours. It's deliciously cutthroat and leads to a lot of laughs around the table. It serves as a great family game as long as people don't mind a few hurt feelings. The only downside is remembering all your meeple values and trying to not knock them over as they really need a wider base in order to truly keep them secret as we kept having problems with them falling over.

This game was easy to understand and alot of fun!!
also play it with the "Survive: The Giant Squid" expansion.

UPDATE: I have played this game alot more now, and it gets better and better, raised score from 8.2 to 8.8

UPDATE 2: After more games with 4 peeps this is a GREAT game!! So much fun, been tweaking with the rules and come up with some own houserules and now its a chaotic fun little game with some great tactics involved. LOVE IT!
Rate raised from 8.8 to 9.2

[b]Thoughts? - [/b]Great update for an old MB classic.  Full of backstabbing and chaos.  The aim of the game is to make your meeples safe, yet the best part of the game is killing the others.  If you get more than a boat load ashore you are doing well if our games are anything to go by!  Plays best with 4 or 5 in my opinion.

[b]Still Play Regularly? - [/b]An occasional treat.

Growing up, Sorry was the favorite family game. Survive has replaced Sorry. This is a great, light, fun family game. Has a lot of luck involved with a little bit of strategy. Making the sound effects of whale hitting a ship is a little more enjoyable than saying "sorry"

I love 'em cutthroat, and this is pretty darn cutthroat.

This is a chaotic game of spite and revenge.  The decisions to be made are straightforward and at high player counts, any kind of strategy can be thrown out the window because the game will have changed so much before it is your turn again, but it is FUN.  This game appeals to that part of your psyche that wants to build something pretty and then just watch it burn to the ground.

The kids and I played it twice in a row.  They loved it and I had fun, too.  I honestly may rate this higher after more turns and those turns being a bit further apart.  2 in a row very late at night, I found myself just wanting it to be over... But I think that's an unfair statement about the game itself and had more to do with the circumstances of play last night. 

Update, after a handful more plays, I'm bumping from 8 to 9.  The kids love it, this game is a ton of fun.

Update about a year later.  I've burned out on this but the kids still love it.  It just seems to take forever to set up and with 3 young kids, the game itself is very long.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Cute mainstream game that is accessible enough to play with the kids while still offering some decision space for the adults. Players each control a stable of people with hidden victory point values on their bottoms. The pawns are seeded out onto an island that is sinking and surrounding by various man-eating beasts such as sea serpents and sharks. A few boats are also present. The goal is to get the people (either by boat or backstroke) to 4 safe islands on the corners of the board.

Each turn players move their own pieces, then remove a chunk from the central island, and then unleash a monster of the deep, which is randomly chosen via a die.

The game ends when one of the later tiles is flipped over which reveals a volcano on its backside, the surviving pawns are checked, and most VPs wins.

Survive is not a hardcore strategy game by any means, but it offers some good decision space, is fast-paced, and is enjoyable to play on occasion, provided that you don't have someone who is too sensitive about getting whacked on the head, because there's a lot of that present here. (i.e.: I could see this being a nightmare with some kids...and some adults I know for that matter). Though the scoring scheme and cleverness of the shrinking board presages the coming Euro invasion in some ways, the gratuitous and completely over the top player hosing reminds you that this is still very much an American design.

Wow, this one's evil.  If your playing with people who can't stand you decimating their players I wouldn't play it.
You're all trying to escape Atlantis before it sinks (I know, big surprise).  Everyone has several small meeples to save.  Players take turns moving their meeples, and controlling the hazards the game offers.  Sharks, sea monsters, and whales.  That's before you add any of the expansions!
So why only a score of seven?  If you have people who try to be nice the game can take a looong time.  Cutthroat is the only way to play!

This game doesn't just play like a Eurogame, it is also better than most Eurogames.  It is extremely simple yet it has a lot of room for planning and decision making and there is a great, layered sense of drama- getting off the sinking island paired with getting your men to islands on the other side of shark, whale, and sea monster-infested waters.  There are a couple of minor issues, the boats seem too rare and easy to get rid of and the endgame is somewhat anticlimatic but nonetheless this is a neglected classic.

A remarkably simple yet fun game. We couldn't help ourselves from going "Daa-dum" every time the shark would make a move. In the end, it didn't even matter if we knew who would win, we wanted to feed more sharks!

One play - a little random but surprisingly fun.  Always a kick to make your opponents meeples get eaten by sharks.

RATING: 7
The saving grace of this game is that it plays quickly.  A lot depends on luck and randomness, but at least it doesn't go on for too long.  As it is, this game is a fun mixture of trying to save your meeples while trying to slaughter your opponent's meeples.  There is a small negotiation factor in table talk to convince other players to attack someone other than you.

A lost gem that thankfully was reprinted recently.  Not for players who don't like direct confrontation, since this game is truly a bloodbath (sharks, whales, and sea monsters!). Much better for three or four players, but still enjoyable for two, there is a constant feeling of adventure and suspense.  The theme of the game matches perfectly with the game play mechanics.  Pure fun for all ages, unless you happen to be a soft-hearted innocent and just want everyone to survive!  Sinking an opponent's piece by removing a tile that just happens to be a shark waiting to eat them is probably one of the most satisfying experiences in gaming.
A vicious game that finds a happy medium between luck and strategy.

This game reminds me a bit of Small World - you have to be mean to other players, but since it's happening constantly all around, it's hard to take it personally.

On a rapidly disappearing island of tiles, players try to rescue their pawns by boat or (much more slowly) swimming.  Dangers abound from whales, sharks and sea serpents.  Some tiles will reveal special abilities to help players along.  At the end you flip over your pawns to reveal their values - can you remember which ones were worth the most?

This game has a high degree of randomness, which could turn off some players.  But it's a fun way to start off or end an evening on a light note.  Try to survive!

Picked this up on Amazon Prime Day in 2016.  Didn't know much about it before hand.  

I think the game is awesome.  My four and seven-year-olds play, and can win!  Lots of dead players, and the scoring on the bottom provides enough variety to make it fun.  

My favorite part is the sinking hex tiles that continually create a moving board.  

I would primarily put it in the family category, but can easily play with adults.  

So glad I chanced my way onto this one.  We played 6 new games over the long weekend, and this was my favorite.

This game is the most fun with people who are willing to get into the game.  I.E. Make sounds effects, talk like a sailor, JAWS music, crunching, etc.  It really does involve a little strategy and is much better than it&#039;s later cousin, Escape from Atlantis.  It&#039;s one of my favorite games to play.

RATING: 4
Fine for what it is, but lighter than I like, and it's just got just enough things going on that it can take longer than I want to be playing it. I'd enjoy it a lot more with either or both of:

* Something to smooth the variance in tile draws - drawing a dolphin is phenomenal, drawing a "relocate a whale" is OK, drawing "add a whale" is meh. Perhaps in a 2p game the luck of the draw evens out over time, but not in 4p.

* A 15-to-20-second turn timer, to promote the feeling of panic and fleeing - embracing its nature as an experience game rather than something super-strategic. (If you don't finish your turn in time, you forfeit some/all of your move actions the following turn.)

I quite like the dynamics of shared boats vs. single-player boats.

Components: Great components in the Stronghold edition. The text is difficult to read on the dark blue meeples, but that has been corrected with the sticker insets in the expansion.
The different height tiles and shaped wooden bits really help the theme.

Experience: This game is all over the map. I was playing vicious, targeting whomever I thought was in the lead, and trying to give my opponents opportunities to do the same. Other opponents were playing nicer, letting boats full of people just skirt by the nasties. The game seems to support both styles of play.

The random setup at the beginning, and the random undersides of tiles should help to keep the game interesting for several plays.

Upon first play with my 7 year old daughter, I really enjoyed this game. The rules were quite easy to learn and teach; everything is intuitive. The components are wonderful; nice thick wood pieces, solid card stock, and nice plastic meeples.  The game play was really entertaining - putting meeples on boats, knocking them overboard with whales, eating them up with sharks.  This game was a blast and I totally want to play it again!  With the added expansion making this playable with 6... I can see getting a lot of replay value. EXCELLENT!

P.S. The only negative I found in the two player was that whales were not as useful in the game.  If I shared a boat with my opponent, I generally don't want to attack it with a whale.  I found we just merely moved whales around the board.  (This game is most likely better with 3 or more players).  I will have to wait to see if my rating changes with more plays.  None-the-less, I am hyped about this game after my first play!

Edit after 3 plays: played with 5 players and the game runs a little slow (due to AP) but it is still fun. More cut-throat action for sure!

Edit after 5 plays: This is an AWESOME family game!!!!  I have played it with my 4 and 7 year old daughters - they both got the hang of the game and we had loads of fun.  I highly recommend this game to families regardless of the competitive nature; just preload the kids before play

Survive is a cutthroat game where players seek to evacuate their pieces from an island that is breaking up, while remembering where their highest-valued pieces are located to maximize their score. An island made up of 40 hex-tiles is slowly sinking into the ocean (as the tiles are removed from the board). Each player controls ten people (valued from 1 to 6) that they try and move towards the safety of the surrounding islands before the main island finally blows up. Players can either swim or use boats to travel but must avoid sea serpents, whales and sharks on their way to safety.

My family hates confrontational games and we usually do best with multi-player solitaire games such as Agricola and Puerto Rico. However, Survive! breaks that mold. Perhaps it's the colorful pieces; perhaps it's the inherent silly-factor that comes along with a gameboard filled with whales, sharks, and sea serpents; or perhaps it's just because the "take that!" nature of the game is so ubiquitous to the game's rules. But whatever the reason, we have a blast playing it and never get pissed at one another for devouring our survivors or sinking our ships.

RATING: 7.75
[21 Jul 2016] - 7.75 (3 plays @ 6 players, 1 play @ 3 players)
This game thrives on nasty player interactions. The goal is to get your meeples off the sinking island while avoiding being eaten by sharks, sea monsters or having the boat destroyed by whales. Without the direct conflict, the game is just a boring exercise in trying to beat the game timer. You have to be willing to gang up on the leader and go after everyone. There is a bit of randomness when you draw the island tile and rolling the hazzard die.

At 6 players the game feels like a race to get safe before something bad happens. You end up tagging along with other players and going full board with the highest value meeples first in an attempt to score points. Being 3 or 4 in the turn order is a huge disadvantage since you lose out on the moving early but don't get an extra boat placement. Once you start falling behind, it's very tough to get back into the game.

At 3 players the game is a little more controlled. You'll get meeples off the island so it's going to be a game or remembering where the high value ones are and not alerting other players to them. Early rounds will have less direct conflict and it's easier to setup longer moves.

This is one of those games that never disappoints. Ever. It's hardly spectacular, but never dull. Better with 3 players, best with 4, this is a cutthroat game where you attempt to guide your prospective survivors off a sinking island to 1 of 4 safe shores, all the while avoiding sea creatures and other dangers that are controlled by the other players on their turns. There are no weak components here: the land tiles really pop due to the varying thicknesses, the wooden pieces are nice, and the small survivors have some weight to them. There is a reason this game has staying power.

The very definition of a Take-That game.  No revenge necessary, just be mean to each other and laugh a lot.  Wonderful bits.  UPDATE: New edition is great.  I'm pretty sure the game comes down to who draws the dolphin or boat tiles but who cares.

This game can be brutal. You try to get your islanders to shore while sinking other player’s islanders. It fits in to the mood of our group and allows up to 6 players with the expansion. We played this one early in 2015 and nothing else we played that year was able to top it.

It's a more-friendly version of Lifeboats, with the right amount of "take-that" for a family game. Beautiful game board and components. (I have an older of the more recent version than the current one -- wooden pieces). I sometimes struggle how to rank these easier/family games.  In that category it's probably close to an '8'.

When I first heard about this re-release I was not that interested.  Unfortunately, part of this lack of interest had to do with prejudice: why should I care about a game from the 80s?  When I first got into board games more seriously I had a tendency to eschew the older games not realizing that there are a lot of gems.  I am amazed at how good this game is.  Survive is one of the most cutthroat games I have ever played, but it is also the kind of game you can play without really caring about who wins.  The most enjoyable games are the ones in which there are hardly any survivors.  There is certainly a lot of luck, but not so much that there are no meaningful decisions to make.

A nostalgic game from my childhood, but it seems to have held up really well and is still quite fun.  In fact, the family-strategy style of this game, and the cool tile flipping mechanic, are what eventually led me to look into newer board games and discover the world of eurogames!

Update: I just replayed this one again, and even with only 2 players, it was much better than I remembered.  I'm looking forward to trying it with more players.  Not only did it lead me to the world of Euro games, I think it also acted as an inspiration for some Euro mechanics.  A classic!

Underrated game! Great fun and for all its seemingly randomness it is well-balanced in the end. A slow-the-leader factor is present but not overwhelming.

Great fun in a simple package, highly recommended for fun factor.

This is just a fun game, which is probably why it is still in print. It's not especially deep, but then neither is it especially long. However there's a little bit of everything for everyone, you want to munch up meeples using sharks, check... but there's also the potential for strategic play and cooperation. The 5-6 Player expansion is a must. And it's good with two also.

Atlantis is sinking and you need to get your people to safety!  The waters are incredibly dangerous, full of sharks, whales, giant squid, and sea monsters, and entire boats full of people will end up being swallowed in one gulp.  Beautiful components and art and just the right amount of conflict and back-stabbiness make this a great classic game.

This game is great!  I wasn't sure what to expect when I played this for the first time, but was pleasantly surprised.  It's above all very fun!  You need to get your people to the other shore safely by any means possible: Boat, Dolphin, and if need be by swimming (not recommended).  Fun bits add to the enjoyment significantly.  Best with 3 or 4 though.

RATING: 7
Light-hearted game of survival whose most remarkable quality is that it feels way ahead of its time.   For an 80s game, it sure feels like a contemporary Euro, albeit a vicious "take that" Euro.   The wooden meeples are a bit of a misfire, as they are not consistent in size or thickness which can make the secret values not secret at all.   There's a lot of randomness in this game, especially with the tile flipping, but it's not a game to take too seriously anyways.

This is just a fun and aggressive game. What I find so amusing though is that people have such a hard time doing mean things to others even in a game where the goal is to screw over your opponents, where the goal is to be mean and where there's no real life consonances. Even then people are like "Well, sorry I just dumped your guy in the drink - Can we still be friends?" This is a game though where people start off like that and I usually just have to come out swinging, make sure a certain tone gets set. Sure that might mean everyone gangs up on me and I don't win, but I'm for damn sure having a great time. So happy to have this one back in print.

Survive is a game for play with friends that aren't aggressive or mad because other attacks them in the battlefield. Is a game that looks for 2 ways, the first one is to deliver your meeples to safe islands, the other one is to be mad with the meeples of others, and make them suffer (by being eaten by sharks or sea monsters).   

The components are great, the tiles are grosser because the kind of terrain they represent. The animals are made of wood. 

Is a game for relaxing and don't go so serious. It's all about fun.

It is a game that teaches you to be a cutthroat double crossing b*****d. The island is slowly sinking and your goal is to have your worthiest survivors on the safe edges of the board. To achieve that you are going to step over the drowning, helpless meeples of your so called friends, you are going to sink the island under their feet and you are going to send all sorts of sea creatures to eat them or crush their hopes. And you are going to laugh about it!

The length of the game is few minutes too long to be a filler but it's perfect small party game. Expansions are bloating the game to below enjoyment and I would not recommend any of them. The base game is just fine.

not really sure this is a great family game. As its pretty aggressive and the only child I've played this with got a little upset when his mum sea monster attacked most of his meeples. There's minimal strategic depth here, just chaotic fun. It is however really simple to teach. Works will with old people for this reason. Can lead to some analysis paralysis as you can't really plan ahead. Although really any sort of plan in this game or analysis is rather pointless.

I grew up playing this game in the 80's, and was always bummed that I could never get my hands on a copy (darn collectors driving up the cost of my childhood memories!!!). HOWEVER, never fear, because the gaming industry finally did something that benefits me; they re-released this game, preserving the feel and function, AND drastically improving the board and playing pieces. I am shocked, and very pleased with this edition. I think it is quite possibly better than the original, and now I am glad I didn't spend 100 dollars on a collectors edition on ebay!!!

BUT, Let's talk shop:

The game board is way bigger than the original, and all the game components are vastly superior in quality. The rules are pretty much exactly as I remember, but I don't remember it being so difficult to keep all your boats. With 4 competitive players playing blood and guts rules (is there another kind?), I would be surprised if there were any boats left at the end.

What I like the most about the game is the island tiles. The thickness varies with the terrain, with the mountain and jungle tiles increasing in thickness, very cool.

The internal storage is awesome, with EXACT spots for all the components. This is a big plus with me because, lets face it, your games unfortunately spend A LOT more time in storage than they do in play mode. So why are the insides of most games seemingly designed by blind monkeys, with absolutely no thought to component storage?

I'm looking at YOU designers of Agricola!!!

Played one game with my niece. It finished 30 to 29 for her, she played he tiles to screw me some turns. Some tiles I flipped over helped her more than me. Sometimes it wasn't funny.


Rules are simple, some straight for what you do with your three actions and do with your tiles if you have any.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Though a children's game, it is surprisingly tactical as well as easy and fun to play. Game length is about right dictated by the fixed number of turns as the island disintegrates meaning it does not bog down. The actual visual and tactile effect of removing the tiles to sink the island is strangely satisfying. It looks cool too and the monster pieces though a bit comic are well done. A simple but great little game.

Solid, fun game. Usually, while playing this game we can't stop laughing as we throw swimmers to the sharks or tip boats. The Meeples in this game are really amazing and the game play is quick and simplistic. Though the strategy is always the same, the game play always differ and the results are not always the same but always hysterical.

RATING: 8
This is a great light weight and chaotic free-for-all.  The rules are pretty simple to learn and the play time is right around an hour or less depending on player number and familiarity with the game.  

The goal is to move your pawns from a sinking Atlantis island to the surrounding safe zones, while dodging sea serpents, sharks, and whales.  If you're picking this one up, I would recommend getting the mini-expansions as well, but they aren't necessary.  The expansions add dolphins and giant squid, and increase the chaos and carnage of the original game.

My group has greatly enjoyed this game for what it is.  You won't find deep strategy here, but it fits the gap between short fillers and the longer, meatier games.   

Players who don't like too much chaos and hate having their game plans messed with should probably stay away from this one.  The game has a high amount of randomness and direct player conflict.  Recommended!  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Survive is chaotic, full of theme and I really love it.  I like the sense of mild panic that comes as the island sinks, more and more people fall into the water and sharks begin the circle.  I also like the way this can be played by children and adults alike and all have a chance.  When playing with 2 we take 2 colours each and have found that this works really well.

A very interactive rush for survival. Players can be as peaceful or cut-throat as they wish, but somebody is going down with the ship! Remembering which piece is a high or low value gets to be tough when drinks are passed around. My favourite 6 player game with the expansions, but player aids are needed for beginners.

45-60m, best with 4-6 players. 10+ plays.

Best enjoyed with taunting and alcohol. There's some, but not much strategy, but that doesn't distract from the fun. Other players and the dice rolls make it difficult to think too far ahead and remembering where you placed those higher value people can be difficult. If played with the right group (one who can playfully get in each others faces) this can be a lot of fun.

I think Downfall of Pompei is a similar game and might be a little bit more of my taste (a little more for gamers), need another play of each to know for sure.

SOLD IT! (for $27)

This is not for the serious player. The game is a pleasant experience however, that is loaded with thematic decisions. I imagine most people will not be concearned with scoring part of it and just cause chaos for the sake of watching their neighbor drown.

I sold it, since I rarely bring want to bring it to game events, since my only reason when bringing it was to have something for casual players. That said, I would still be happy to play another person's copy if they had it.

RATING: 4
More for kids and would be great fun if I was 7.  It's highly random, lots of luck, ganging-up is possible, impossible to catch-up if you fall behind and very little strategy overall.  Whoever gets the red tile boats and dolphins is likely to win.  This should not be ranked so high (#205) best game on BGG.

RATING: 6
Easy to learn game with great bits, but lacking a little in strategy options and, surprisingly, theme.  In this genre I prefer Der Untergang von Pompeji, http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/13004/the-downfall-of-pompeii. Tried the giant squid expansion, but it makes the environment so dangerous that all of the explorers will likely be eaten before the island sinks.  Perhaps using just one squid, or limiting them to plucking explorers out of boats (but not off the land tiles) would be more satisfactory.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Well, I don't know what to say about this one. This title gets a pretty high rating here on BGG as a family game, but Survive fell flat in our household. We simply felt that there was no tension and only a very thin element of strategy. In a 3 player game, we found it to be a grind after awhile. Perhaps it gets better with a larger group.

This is a goooood game.  Ostensibly a "family" game, there's a lot of meat here for the hardcore gamer to dig into and the game can get pretty vicious by those so inclined.

Hidden deployment, pick up and deliver, modular boards, temporary alliances and shared incentives, sinking islands, sharks, whales, sea monsters, and more!!  

And the kids love it too!

Survive is a fast and fun and very mean remake of a game I have played about 20-25? years ago. The thick cardboard tiles (the mountains are massive), the ships and monsters are nicely done, although the board and tiles look somewhat photo-esque. so the style is not exactly what I would have preferred. It plays fast and uncomplicated and is, the rather brave price in mind, a little bit too light for my taste.

Great family game. Simple mechanics, great theme, excellent components. I played it with 2 and hated it, but I love it with 3, 4, and 5. You never know who's winning, so players usually target each other equally with the monsters. This makes the "Take That!" aspect of the game fun, not mean. Giant squid expansion included.

Some of my original meeples arrived badly marked, ruining the hidden value aspect of the game. The 5-6 player expansion fixed that but I was annoyed it was necessary.

(As of [b]1[/b] play) This addresses a lot of the issues I have with [GAMEID=13004]. The theme is more accessible and fun right from the start, whereas in Pompeii things don't really start moving until the volcano erupts. The hidden value of your people adds a cool bluffing dimension, and being able to control the sea monsters is just plain fun. Let me say that again... this is JUST PLAIN FUN. No brain-burning, no deep strategy. Just you, your friends, a sinking island, sharks, whales, and sea monsters. Enjoy.

What should be a quick, fun game of "take that!" and general silliness goes on too long for me. I think those that grew up with this over-value it a bit. It's a good implementation of the cutthroat experience and good for some table talk with non-gamers, otherwise I'd rather do something else for 90-120 minutes (yeah, that's how long our 6P game took).  

For my tastes, I'd rather play a clever card game filler than this type, but it's good for the right moment.

Fun game - the more people, the harder it is. The only thing I don't like is it has the potential to get very conflict-heavy...which for some participants, isn't always a good thing.

I played this as a kid (20+ years ago) and was thrilled to see it was back in print. We have a lot of fun playing this as a family and with visitors (young and old, usually non-gamers). There's a lot of luck in what turns up with the tiles and the monster die but smart tactics will improve your chances. For the sake of my 7yo, we have not yet played with the varying Survivor values (number printed on the Survivor bases); that will be a good mechanic to add at a later date.

Family game, but really vicious. Not deep or overly strategic, but is great as a "Take That" game where you kill off other players with glee. 

And there is definitely some pleasure to be had having more than one opposing swimmer stuck on the same hex with a shark nearby and rolling a shark on the die or having the ship one space from shore and having the serpent  kill it.

Survive is a luck based game with guaranteed laughs -- as long as  you can handle sea monsters eating your meeples...

It is a fun game, where winning seems like an afterthought. The theme is captured in a chaotic escape from a sinking island.

Played 4 times with 2 & 3 players for 2 hours.

OCT 2009: It's like Tikal with a Lifeboats theme and lots and lots of sea-beasties! I loved it! Great mix of action-point system, hose-your-neighbors, and escape for your lives. My first game including rules lasted 45 minutes. Very very nice. It's a shame a mass-market game like this is out of print and yet Monopoly has 3000 different editions.

AUG 2013: A little too random with two players, but still fun.

This is a great game with a lot of replayability.  It is relatively quickly played.  Be mindful that the object of game involves directly harming opponents by sending them to the sharks.  Keep that in mind if played with those who easily anger or if their feelings get hurt.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game is mean but in a nice way. By that I mean that going after an opponent's survivors is often the most defensive move you can make. "It's not that I want your survivors to be eaten," you tell your friend, "it's just that I want that shark as far away from my survivors as possible." This game does suffer a bit from the Catan Factor:  where you might find yourself lamenting bad decisions that you made during the initial survivor placement "draft" way back at the start of the game. Luckily this game is nowhere near as long as Catan.

Played my first game of this with Mr. Billington today (9-10-2011).  We had to play it twice, actually, because the first time the rules didn't make sense to us ... and by the time they did, we decided to scrap the first game and play another one.  And enjoyed the game.  We both agreed it's probably alot better with 3 or more players, rather than just 2.

Very funny game! It's a great game to break the ice, so, it's ideal to start a game session or to be played between more complex or long games. It's all about attack and devour your opponent's playing pieces (guys/meeples) with the help from sea creatures: sharks, whales and the giant and horrible sea serpents. I's not the kind of game to play against very competitive people, as they could feel angry seeing their meeples going to the stomach of sharks and sea monsters.  In the other hand, is an appropiate game to play with people able to laugh at any situation, even at their own expense.

A home-run reprint from Stronghold Games.  I have never played the previous versions, but this is a real winner for me.  The production is incredible and the game is fast, clever, and vicious.  Rules depth is non-gamer friendly and the strategies are deeper than they first look.  I look forward to many plays of this.

One of my lost childhood games!  Yes, so I had the original PB edition, but this one stays extremely faithful to that version, plus has a few extras to it which make it a very nice game with a great theme and good balance of skill, luck, and chaos.  I'm so happy how well this one holds up. It creates some really lovely tension and the new reprint is amazing! It is fun with any number of players. Perfect for all ages and player skills. There is quite a bit of luck to this one (in terms of what tiles get pulled, die roll, etc.) but it still has a special place in my heart and a very enjoyable theme.

I love this game. Every player gets 10 tokens so spread around a sinking island. The sand begins to sink first, then the forest, then the mountains. When an eruption occurs, game over! Anyone left on land tiles that aren't safe, or that are left in the sea will die. As the game progresses, everyone manipulates sharks, whales, and boats. Your meeple tokens have points on the bottoms of them that you're allowed to see only one time, and that's during the phase where you alternate populating the island. Any meeples that have made it to safe shores are flipped over at the end of the game to count up the points. This is a great family and friend game that's not hard to learn or teach at all.

Survive! is a classic game in the euro cannon, that can provide its share of laughs through its simple but brutal "take that" gameplay, but it does show its age.  I feel a few house rules might elevate it, but I haven't as of yet felt compelled to do so.  I enjoy the occasional play, but with so many games already in my collection, and with better games where i can get that feel of taking it to my opponents I feel Survive! will be just what it is.  A fun, light gateway that gets a play or two each year, and then gets shelved.

RATING: 7
Light, casual, confrontational family game. I wouldn't really bring this out in any other context. It's kind of in the same tier as Ticket to Ride in terms of player engagement, interaction, and quasi-strategy: very simple choices, some planning possible but easily derailed by luck, and plenty of room for impish "take that" behavior.

After one play.

Simple game of take that, with a bit of memory and tactical maneuvering. I went into the game with fairly low expectations, wanting only a fun, short game to play with non-gamers. The non-gamers said they enjoyed it, but they didn't demonstrate the same kind of enthusiasm they'd shown for other gateway games, like Machi Koro. I was disappointed--it just wasn't very fun, though I'm not sure why. The take that mechanic feels so simplified that it lacks tension, whereas in more complex executions you could derive greater satisfaction in screwing up someone else's plans. Here it just feels kind of obnoxious and bratty. The core of the strategy lies in how you manage your differently-valued people, whether you try to hitch a ride with someone else's boat or commandeer your own destiny, but that wasn't nearly as interesting as I'd hoped it'd be. In any case, I'll try to get it to the table again, but I'm guessing it may not last long in the collection.

Components are pretty and the cardboard is nice and thick (and it's nice that the different terrains have different thickness), but it feels like thick chrome on skimpy game play.

One of my favorite family games. Be aware it is a mean game, so kids will need to be able to deal with haven't their guys eaten. I think it's most fun when the kids gang up on the adults.

Plays well with all ages and all creeds. Everyone who has played this in my group wants to play it again and again. Sometimes tension can get heated and is best if all double crossing stays within the game but besides that, absolutely brilliant reprint by Stronghold.

Just... all my moves seem pretty obvious. But hey! It's a grest family game that looks great and will make people laugh and cry.

This game rocks. It's so satisfying to send sharks or sea serpents after the other players. This is a game of a sinking island that you need to get your people off of and then to 1 of 4 islands. Boats are limited and many of your people will be swimming for their lives. There are many things to make this difficult for you. Such as, whales, sea serpents and sharks. All of which are nasty. Unless your the one sending them after the other players. Then it's just plain fun lol.

This is a great game and I recommend it to everyone from families to gamers.

A great game for everyone. The Stronghold 2011 edition is by far the best one to date. It's a lot of fun, easy to teach/learn and has the option of playing with a few different varients. Some from the older editions of the game and some new ones also.

RATING: 8
Based off of one game with new edition.

This was a total blast! The piece quality is excellent, the gameplay is fun, and it's awesome to eat other people's swimmers with the sharks. Nom nom nom.

Compared to Pompeii, this game has about the same playing time, a little bit more tactical depth, and a lot more fun. Results may vary, but I prefer eating swimmers to dropping dudes into a volcano.

Played with the giant squid expansion as well, and while it's a lot of fun, I think it turned the nice balance of the original into a chaotic fest of death, which isn't necessarily a good thing.

I'd consider this a gateway/gamer game hybrid. It's very easy to teach and the theme works in such a fantastic manner that everyone grasps the idea of how to win/what they are doing very quickly. There is quite a bit of luck and guessing involved, but also some very tense choices you have to make. You WILL be tormenting other plays just as they are tormenting you....and it's wonderful! }:D

I'm also shocked at the optional rules you can throw in and out of the game. It's very modular in that sense. I see why this is a classic.

Not an awful game, but it starts slowly, the monsters are only moderately effective, and most of the better bonuses come near the end when there's no-one left to rescue. Not to mention more than one person can be left just 'going through the motions' until the end of the game once their people are all saved or eaten.

I'll play it with the youngest, he enjoys it, but I can't imagine asking anyone to play it otherwise.

Good light-hearted, yet suspenseful game - good for drawing new hobbyists in with simple rules and gameplay.

It also looks beautiful on the table.  Fun game!

What a brilliant game!

We played with random initial tile placement, which helps make the game unique every time.

The game is so simple but so perfectly fits the theme of an island self destructing and hoardes of panic stricken tourists rushing to boats and attempting to make their way to safety through whale, sea searpent, and shark infested waters.

What a hoot! Unless someone you play with has had the concept of fun medically removed from their brain, everyone will have one great time with this game.  The component quality is lower than the Escape from Atlantis sequels, but the gameplay is best as written in the original Survive! game.

My husband and I played Survive: Escape from Atlantis again, long after our first three plays many years ago. We still think that this game does not shine with two players.

The kids like this game and the only thing I don't like is the 4 players only...well pretty much. 2 players each take two colours. However it does scale with less. It's just that you'll be playing the game sub-optimally with less than 4.

I like it and it's pretty cool. This is one of those classics that just stands the test of time. The blind points is my favorite part. I love games with hidden information.

KOREA

Survive is the board game I never knew I wanted when I was a kid. Unfortunately, I didn't find it until 34 years after it first came out. The game play has three basic steps: 

1) Move guys and/or boats
2) Take an available tile and follow the instructions
3) Roll the dice and move a creature

Because it is so simple, it works really well for families. But be careful: unless the people you are playing with have thick skins, you will make enemies. This game is MEAN! And I think that's why gamers might still appreciate this game despite the randomness inherent in the tile-taking or dice-rolling stages of the game.

Along with Takenoko, this is my go-to game for people new to the hobby!

A good amount of luck rolls involved, but so much satisfaction getting a boat devoured! lol. Despite it looking like a childrens game, it is extremely cut throat.

RATING: 7.5
Embrace the mayhem! A favorite of my 7 y.o. Having their explorers eaten may be difficult for some younger players to handle, but usually they seem to enjoy the game enough that playing helps them get over that. Playing with the explorer values hidden is critical so that the game continues to feel competitive to the end. Best at 4p. For 2p games, playing with two colors each is a must to fill the island. Components are very nice. Looks great on the table. Negatives are that the game can drag on a bit if if players don't take their turns quickly, and that the limited movement of the sea creatures can make cautious play an effective if boring option. The latter is fixed by the dive dice expansion. Rating rises to 8 with the expansion.

Yeah, it's Parker Brothers, but it's better than you might think. The hidden values assigned to the various people is a brilliant (though unscrupulous) addition.  Yes, the game is very random.  But it's also great fun with its winning combination of unpredictability, light tactics, timing, cooperation and temporary alliances, playing the odds, and eating other players with sharks!

In 1982, I really wanted the Milton Bradley electronic board game, Dark Tower, for Christmas.  But with an insane $80 price tag, I did not think anyone would be willing to get it for me.  I asked for this game instead.  At that age, I was intimidated by the complicated-looking rules, so I asked my older brother to explain it to me, and we had a lot of fun with it.

Years later, I made two surprising discoveries:  my brother hadn't explained all the rules correctly, and the game is actually still pretty entertaining.  It's mostly chaos, but there's some mild strategy involved and it's usually pretty tense right up until the end (unless everyone gets their pieces home early).  

The version I own is just titled Survive! and is made by Parker Brothers.  I'd love to get an updated version of it (although the PB version does have really nice components, which have held up very well over the years).

I have the 30th anniversary edition of this game, and I bought the 6 player expansion at the same time. 
What a great design!
This game works very well at making people mad enough to never want to play it again.
I'm serious.

Don't play it with new gamers. Play this with the same group that plays Cutthroat Caverns - people who don't get their feelings hurt when other players gang up on them. 
This game is the KING of "back-stabbing" game play.
You can't play nice AT ALL. It won't let you.

Nice looking game, but it seems to end rather quickly with the whirlpool dragging the surrounding pieces of land down.  This made it all seem a bit random.  We enjoyed it more with the earlier rules that the whirlpool only drags down items in the surrounding water (boats, swimmers, monsters, etc).

I love this, even though I'm no good at it. I take way too much pleasure in knocking over boats and sending sharks to devour my opponents to actually get all in on the bluffing and deduction.

We added on the squids and dolphins, but I didn't bother with the extra player expansion. The base game has wooden pieces, the extra player expansion has plastic pieces. Technically compatible but just ... ehhhhhhhh.

Surprisingly good for a Parker Brothers game from the 80s. The rules are simple enough that my four year old can play, but there's enough depth that my gamer friends will play it too.

My daughter and I use the following house rules:

- Skip setup and just put your people wherever.
- The first person to get three people to an island wins.
- Sea creatures are friendly, and they don't like to eat people. (Sometimes I can convince her that they're just taking people off the board for a friendly swim.)

Played a few 4 player games now, and I still really like it.  The fact that the die gets rolled 3 times before it's your turn again can really put best laid plans down the drain as your opponents can gang up to send a slow moving sea monster as far as it needs to snack on your unsuspecting boaters.  The feel of this game is just amazing though and it really does give the sense of urgency and doom as the island sinks around you revealing more dangers and rarely any glimmer of hope for your colourful meeples.  And it begs for house rules and variants too.

You want to get dirty, backstab your friends and break relationships, this game is for you! In this epic race for survival, you control a people desperately trying to flee the sinking Atlantis. But you're not alone and you can bet that you're neighbours will throw everything they got to get out before you do, leaving you helpless in a sea of monsters, whales and sharks waiting to eat every single one of you're citizens.

This game is fast and fun. Easy to learn yet challenging. It offers a good opportunity to test who's a bad looser amongst your friends or family.

Not a bad game. Pretty dependent on the luck of the tile draw, not really complaining about it because I don't mind games with a good amount of randomness in them. But to mitigate this and to do well in the game you really have to be quite persuasive to convince people to mess up the other players' plans rather than yours. Or sit quiet like a mouse and hope that no one notices that you are ahead, but that strategy is probably not going to work for you.

The game is fun and has a nice theme. It is fun eating your foes and capsizing boats. This is a good one for families although there are a number of small things, rules, to remember.

Overall its a fun game with great components but the depth of strategy is not so great. However, I do not really think that was the objective of the designer, but rather to just have a fun family game.

To me playing with all people equal to only 1 point seems awful and would remove half of the strategy.

The venerable Survive has interested me for a long time. When I finally got a chance to play it, it did not disappoint. 

You move your meeples as fast as you can from the sinking island of Atlantis. Pieces are removed from the island each turn, sometimes resulting in your meeples turning into swimmers. Ideally, they will boat to safety, but sometimes swimming is the only option. There's a bit of "take that", but clever play is really more about making friends than making enemies. You want to ride someone else's boat to safety, saving your precious actions for other things. Each piece removed from the island also either causes an event (such as a shark showing up) or goes in your hand and can be played later at an opportune time (such as a dolphin that can push your swimmers quickly to shore). 

The one drawback to the components is the dark-printed number on the bottom of each meeple that is very tough to see, especially on the blue pieces. That said, the very cheap (about $7.50) expansion fixes this and also expands the game to up to six players. That's an incredible bargain. Otherwise, the graphic design, the pieces themselves, and especially the tiles are of excellent quality. Seeing it on the table immediately makes you want to play. Its cute, primary-colored pieces belie the vicious gameplay, yet it is simple enough for almost anyone to get into immediately.

Ultimately, this is one of those games that really can appeal to just about everyone. Kids to adults, gamers to non-gamers, etc. It has that "deep filler" feel that I personally love and I will be adding this to my shelf in the very near future.

This was the most played game in my collection for some time. There's a lot to like about it: easy to pick up, intense decisions, exploding islands, and some good ol' fashion backstabbing. The game does peak around halfway or so, and from that point on people seem to lose interest since the characters they have left will likely not make it to land. But with a relatively short play time, that's not too much of a detriment. Overall it's solid game I recommend to any group.

Co-op variant to play with younger kids:

-3 players, or 4 players with only 7 meeples each
-cooperative effort to get as many humans to islands
-ignore the numbers
-at the end of your turn you can give a tile from your hand to another player.
-if a tile has a creature on it, it goes on the spot of the tile
-creatures automatically move to the closest target they can affect
-humans win by outnumbering the creatures in the end

RATING: 9
This game is FUN and very interactive! The fun, and not depth, is the attraction of this game. I have played it with serious games, who enjoyed it, but I believe the typical target group would be families and more casual gamers. 

The game is very confrontational, so it may not be a game for people who dislike direct conflict. You will have to move sharks and sea monsters to eat your opponents' meeples. There is really no down-time, as actions of all other players will change the board and have an impact on your position. Lots of tension and excitement. 

There is some strategy in placing and moving the higher valued meeples, but the luck factor is very high. The good thing is that if you loose, you don't have to feel bad about it - it is not a test of your brain's capacity. 

Prodution quality is top-notch, with a beautiful board, nice wooden components and thick cardboard tiles.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's a cute game, and it oozes atmosphere-- it's fun to watch the catastrophe gradually unfold. Light and quick moving. I'd call it a solid opener or closer. Only one complaint about the Stronghold edition: the meeples are very prone to being knocked over, revealing their hidden score. Other than that it's a great production.

This game is always a go-to for any board game group I play with. They just can't get enough of this game. I really enjoy it a lot. One of the first board games I bought after getting Settlers of Catan - mostly because it looks like Settlers of Catan. Escape the island, get your meeples to safety and thwart your opponents with sharks and sea monsters! Lots of fun. Also - tiles are modular which means it's not the same game every time. Love it! Also .... little boats!!

One play w/ a 1st edition, and now another with my very own Stronghold edition- and you can still color me impressed.

Survive! is a very simple game, but the pieces come together in such a way as to make it competitive, interactive, suspenseful and yet open to newer and older players alike.

The components are truly awesome (though the black ink on blue meeples is very hard to read), and the game is still as fun as ever, and even prettier/better feeling in the Stronghold edition.

A classic!

(05/26/2014) Comment based on 1 play of the reprint.

A well produced, family-accessible, silly-fun game of desperate, panicky, cut-throat goodness that plays within an hour.

You have a bunch of meeples that start off on the sinking island of Atlantis, and you are trying to get them to safety, from the middle to one of the four corners of the board. Each turn, you have three action points to move your meeples onto boats, moving a row boat, or have a meeple swim. another land hex disappears, which can then trigger the spawning of sharks, whales, and vortexes that can eat your swimming meeples, sink your rowboats, or suck up everything within a 1-hex radius. Some tiles can be kept and played later for the players' advantage. However, each turn a special die is thrown, which governs whether a sea serpent (which sinks and eats the meeples), shark, or whale moves, at the player's discretion.

The last part is great fun, as players direct the ever increasing predators at other players' swimming meeples or loaded rowboats carrying survivors. There is a lot of cut-throat action because of this, with lots of yelling and cussing. However, on the bottom of each meeple is a score value (from 1 to 6 VP) that is summed up if the meeple makes it to the safe shores. The other players do not know what which ones are the most valuable, so there is a lot of bluffing and misdirection, in order to get those VIPs out and safe, while sacrificing the lower VP meeples. There is also the "bash the leader", especially if a player has all of their meeples still alive--in this game, no one makes it out with all of their meeples!!!

Simple rules, fast play, little downtime, and great production values make this a pleasure to play. One cannot take this game too seriously, due to the sheer number of predators and high luck factor. You may as well accept it that a lot of your meeples will be eaten, and that there will be a lot of "take that" screwage throughout. If you can get past that, it is quite enjoyable. It is a solid "7".

Be the drunk guy in the lifeboat with the flare gun and the gas can...  [i]sink it out of spite to kill the other two guys and deny everyone else the boat.[/i]

An ugly little game where the land sloughs off into an ocean boiling with hungry things.  You try to drive your people to safety, everyone else drives the hungry things to their appointed dinners.

Who will make it off the island alive?  The hairdresser or the Nobel Laureate?

My money's on NO ONE.

UPDATE:  The art & design in the new 30th Anniversary Edition are flat-out brilliant.  Also, having uniform plastic meeples is actually better than the misshapen, tippy wooden ones from the previous edition.

I finally sat down to play with my wife and daughters. This is a great game.  As usual it seemed a bit complex to them as I read rules but after  2 turns, everyone locked in o. The process.  Basically you gotta get meeples off sinking Atlantis by boat or swimming.  Every turn a player removes part of the island, moves their meeples, and moves a sea creature which will take out boats, swimmers, or both.  We all fou d it fun and engaging with some really good strategies to consider.  Its very interactive, simple for young kids while remaining challenging to adults.  Very few games can pull this off.  Great production value, too. Warning: be sure your game partners, kids or significant others can handle it when you feed their last surviving meeples to the sharks...it will happen.

We used to play the heck out of this game when I was in high school - a friend had grown up with it and introduced it to our original gaming group back then.

The original "Survive" was my very first experience with a board game that didn't involve direct conflict (checkers, chess), cards, or going around a square board. The modular board with hexagonal movement was amazing to me and overall would probably almost count as my first Euro experience. 

It's fun to see that it is back in print and it would be fun to have a copy for old time's sake, though better games have come my way since.

The game's pretty cut-throat. I lost many games because everyone was against me. It's amusing, but it is not for players who hate that kind of stuff. I personally don't mind it, but I think there's a lot of luck involved in this game. I'm not a fan of the single die rolling after every player to see what sea animal moves. Too chancy for my taste.

I'll be keeping this one because Ruben seemed to really like it. I didn't have a great first game. In the 2 player game, luck seems huge. Ruben pulled all of the most powerful tiles, and I pulled pretty awful ones. I also think he played better than I did, so there's that. 

I think this game would be much more fun with 4 players. I'll keep it, since it seems like it'd be easy enough to get to the table. But I am hoping my opinion improves with more plays!

Update: Played a 3 player game with me, Ruben, and a 13 year old. Had a much better time. Even just one more player really seems to balance the luck problem out, and having to worry about fewer meeples helped. 

Original Rating: 7 -> Current Rating: 8.

Yet another hugely successful game for my group - I have yet to find someone not having a blast when they play it. It's simple, funny as hell, and always ends up being requested again and again.  We always play a cutthroat version of it (where a vacant space is simply a space with no land - this leads to much more chaos when people play tiles to move creatures across the board and right under a boat full of meeples) since we prefer the more hectic games.

I have played this game a number of times and always enjoyed it.  It is also short and can be played while waiting for another game to start.

Major kudos to the team who decided to reimagine this 80s gem! The heavier hex tiles and wooden play pieces of the 2010 reboot contribute to a fun and functional design that immediately draws you in. Survive joins a shortlist of games where the goals and strategies are simple enough to make your first turn feel comfortable and satisfying. Yes, you may need the instructions nearby to remind you what exactly your red whale tile does, but I never felt bamboozled by the more experienced player teaching us. Strategy and fortunate timing combined to make a very fun game for us. Bring on more!

RATING: 4
So far this game has succeeded in pissing me off every time we play it. The rest of my friends seem to enjoy it though and I suspect my frustration with this game is my own failing.

I think this is one of those games where you have to go into a mode of completely not caring whether you win or lose. Trying to be strategic is just a recipe for frustration and will probably just end up with all of your meeples getting eaten by sea monsters.

This game is ok for what it is but I just don't like games that essentially come to down to the whims of your opponents.

I had heard that if you liked killing people with lava in Pompeii, you would like its earlier cousing -- survive, where you can eat them with sea monsters, sharks and whales.

P.B. Edition of Survive(hidden numbers) 

What a neat little awesome themed game that I really wish I could have played in 1982 instead of discovering in 2007, THE THEME IS THE GAME, no paste-up here.

Everyone starts on an island (made up of tiles) and the object is to get to shore as fast as possible by swimming or boat. The need to go fast is due to all the lurking dangers, Whales, Sharks and Sea serpents in the water.  The island starts sinking one tile at a time until a Volcano tile is turned over and then the game ends as the Volcano destroys everything left on the board. Who ever has the highest total on their survivors wins.

Simple rules and very fast turns make up this game.  Really almost ahead of its time and quite compariable to games nowadays with 3 action points per turn, hidden values of your men which can induce a bluffing effect, a great dose of screwage and a modular board. The game has a big dose of luck and some randomness which should but lethal together but it really doesn't detract here, it is a 45 minute to one hour light and fun game that would make a great gateway game (leave out over sensitive people maybe though).  

The memory element is optional; my memory sucks so I like playing without it. I also think playing without the hidden values wouldn't  be as fun, easy to fix if you get the other version.  Oh, it is not all luck either, there are some important timing aspects, small decisions and anticipation of where your opponents are hiding their big value people.  Some nice tension created with the monsters in the sea, uncertainty in the tile flip and the unknown time factor near the end. 

Best with four I think, then 3 but playable 2 - 4 (2 with 2 colours each best). A little more control with 2 and more chaotic with 4 but then that is part of the fun here. Not to be overlooked due to age and well worth seeking out if a light fast fun game with screwage sounds good to you. Very comparable to Pompei which I intend to play very soon, will update after playing it.

The Island. Bokkensprong 17/05/2013 met Ward (8), grootva, Claudia en ik. Kinderspel: mannetjes van jouw kleur plaatsen op een eiland van zeshoekige stenen (strand, bos, bergen) dat langzaam in zee zinkt. Mannetjes moeten met sloepen of zwemmend op het vasteland (in hoeken van speelbord) zien te geraken. Walvissen gooien sloepen om, haaien eten zwemmers op, en draken zijn gevaarlijk voor beide. Wie het meeste punten overbrengt, wint. Vrij hoge geluksfactor; daarom vooral tof voor/met kinderen. Ideaal gezinsspel met 6-10 jarigen.

Cadeau gedaan aan mama en papa, Oudejaarsavond 2013.

Great game for kids and adults as well.A  good deal of strategy.Best with three or 4 players as the bloodshed factor becomes high as the island sinks faster and you get fewer turns.Have played this often the last 20 years.Must have the version with the people with the point values on the bottom to truly enjoy.I own the parker brothers version.

Another game that escaped me from my youth, bought the updated version and just played yesterday. Absolutely love it. Although I wish the icons were clearer as how to play the tiles in your hand without having to constantly consult the rule book. Wished they would have added a cheat sheet on the board or a separate sheet. Was giddy with delight once I realized Legos could replace meeples (as I have several of the minifigures). Ordered brown lego slats to go on boats to hold them in place and printed some cards for point value. Added some pics to the image gallery with more to come of a game in progress. Very devious, suspenseful and fun. A MUST BUY.

This was one of my favourites as a kid.  I rediscovered it when my nephews found  it in my mom's basement and wanted to try it.  They absolutely loved it and beg me to play it at every opportunity.

I love the fact that it's a "politically incorrect" kids game.  You have to use those sharks and sea monsters to eat your opponents if you want to win.

If you are playing with people without the "killer instinct" it's not much fun.

1982!  Take another look at this one:  it is really a German-style game in Parker Brothers clothing.  Perhaps that's why it flopped in the U.S. marketplace way back when.  I'm glad my wife held onto her childhood copy of it.  Not quite as interesting as a more modern game, but certainly amazing from a historical perspective.  If you look at the board without your glasses on, you might see a shadow of Settlers lurking there (a hex-tile island with several terrain types---of course, in SURVIVE!, you're trying to escape from the island, not colonize it.  SURVIVE! is a bit like Settlers run backward). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One of the few screw your neighbor(s) games that I actually enjoy, probably because you can plan for loosing meeples since you know it will happen at some point(s). When some get eaten, there is still a lot to think about in order to save the rest.

Survive: Escape from Atlantis! has a very open decision space to enjoy and some fun moments, but it's an extremely light affair with the decent chance that luck will trump any decision-making. I'd recommend it as a family or gateway game, but it's not the kind of game I'd want to play frequently.

Cripes what a great game. The new edition is FANTASTIC. I am sorry I missed this one growing up. A great mix of help-your-neighbor / screw-your-neighbor as you guide life rafts either to shore or into the gaping maw of a sea monster--depending on who's on the raft. The new edition has these cool superthick tiles that do a great job conveying the sinking island feeling. Can not recommend enough.

Initial Rating: 8.0 (May 2011)

Good game that can lead to hurt feelings, I like it a lot because I love confrontational games. The Stronghold edition is very well done EXCEPT for the quality of the  figures. I have played with 3 different copies and they all had some broken component (Stronghold always replaced the damaged components). The game offers lots of fun in a reasonable time frame. I´m not sure about adding more players with the expansion though.

Survive is not a deep game, it´s main appeal is the “take that” factor but I also like the temporal alliances and negotiation needed to win.

If I play I want to play with the hidden values under my meeples, that makes the game a lot more strategic for me.

Current Rating: 8.0

I downgraded the rating to a 7.0 because this is not a game I want to play all the time, only occasionally. Still Survive is a good game.

This way it reflects better my feelings toward the game and it matches the BGG ranking system.

Nowadays, I almost never want to play survive, It is a good game but I don’t want to play it, so for now I’m downgrading its rating to a 6.0. I sold my new copy. I want to play this around once every 6 months.

This comment is for the 30 Anniversary edition. 

I’m a little disappointed that Stronghold  decided to take some things from the game (the Dive Dice, and the Dolphins), the core stuff is still there, but knowing that this edition has less variants than the previous one, (somehow) detracts from the game for me. To be congruent with my ratings, I’m downgrading this to a 6.5.

The only positive are the plastic meeples with CLEARLY read numbers on their bases.

I’m neutral on the art change.

If I’m buying Survive, I will buy the 2011 edition. 

Current Rating: 6.5

2013-05-03

To be congruent with my ratings, I’m downgrading the rating of this edition as well. Stronghold is selling the missing components as promo expansions, I don’t agree much with this policy as the old game had them in it. This rating reflects the fact that I want to play the game perhaps every 6 months AND that I consider this new edition to be inferior to the previous one.

Current Rating: 5.0

There are three sets of players for this game - 1)  AP-Prone Eurogamers - they will hate it, 2) Kids (the intended audience) - they will love it, and 3) Hardcore AT gamers.....they will love it, hate it, and then realize what is, and then love it again.  This is a knife-fight in a phone booth.  Nothing special and winning/losing isn't the point - it's all about screwage of your friends and neighbors.  I love it, my kid loves it, what else matters?  I wouldn't play it for money but that's not the point, is it?

I've played this game since I was 9. My buddy and I used to play this, "Dark Tower", "Cosmic Encounter", "Conspiracy" for ever.

Like "Cosmic Encounter" I have 3 versions of this game (our old copy, Waddington's "Escape from Atlantis", and the reprint). 

It gets a 10 from me, like "Cosmic Encounter", because I'm still willing to play it and I still have a blast.

We had a wildly wicked and bloody game down in Dallas in 2010 with Koldfoot, Okie, another gentleman, and myself. I won, but it was a very fun time.

I remembered loving this as a kid. I've played recently and I still love it because it has such great opportunities to screw with your fellow players.  "Oh, did I just have a whale destroy your boat and put you right next to a shark?"  Plus keeping track of which of the people have which number is very important. Plus not knowing when the game will end exactly makes that last part of the game tense.

This was a pretty great, cut-throat family game. The mechanics are simple and easy to teach. The expansions add a lot of variety and replayability.

Survive: Escape from Atlantis! is the nicest little mean game I've ever played.  What I mean is for a "take-that" game, a really mean one at that, it's actually a good amount of fun.  I love how the board is set up randomly each game and slowly disappears into the ocean throughout play.  Some of the tiles seem awfully powerful, but if you can deal with the chaos, and put your feeling aside for a bit, I think anyone will have fun with this one.

A family favourite when i was a kid. My sister took many a thrashing from me and eventually stopped playing with me. I always gave her green and it was marked so that i could tell where the 6,5,and 4's were so i could kill them off first. This game is timeless in my eyes. To this day my sister accuses me of cheating whenever we play a game.

You have to admit that Survive was definitely ahead of its time, but even though the new version looks nice, the game still feels dated and a little stale.  Maybe because there are so many hidden identity games, the random elements, kingmaking issues and length of play make this more of a game to play every once in a while.  I don't foresee it ever becoming a favorite.

Sometimes I rate my games based on how much I enjoy having the crap being beat out of me. Survive rates high on the "my kids are ganging up on me...and I'm so proud of them" scale. The mechanics are pleasing. The quality of the build is good. My daughter almost always wins... If you get this, I urge you to also get the 5-6 player expansion. It is even more brutal. If you get two people to shore safely, you're doing well in the expansion.

RATING: 6.5
[Escape from Atlantis] Very unique race-off-the-island game. Its a very quick game that seems a bit unbalanced and random (whirlpool?), but is still fun to play. The components for the newer version are fantastic although a bit fiddly, and the map seems a tad too small.

Overall, I think it makes for a nice heavier filler.

There is a movie called "There will be blood".  In this game, there will be blood.  You'll be sending sharks to eat your competition, sending sea monsters to take out boats full of people who were just about to reach safety, and generally doing anything annoying to undermine your opponents.  

Table flipping may occur.

Just recently I had two of my most valuable survivors in a boat just two actions away from being safe and ensuring my win.  A sea monster sat right next to the boat.  It was a risk i was willing to take.  I survived everyone's turn except the very last die roll of the person to my right.  She sent the sea monster to dine on my points and she won the game instead.  AHHHHHHH!!!

Rated as a Children's/Family Game.  I'd probably get rid of this one if not for our 8 year old son.  He actually finds it a bit too hostile still but I do love this newer edition from a bits and gameplay perspective.  There just isn't as much strategy and thought to it as I might like.  I do like the small memory element of trying to remember which of your meeples are worth the most.  Few games employ that well though its probably another reason I wouldn't otherwise keep it.  I do strongly prefer the game with some of the expansions.  A lot of old games should really stay buried but this was not one of them so good job to Stronghold Games in bringing this one back in such a beautiful way!

This game rarely gets played, which is strange since its a good game. It falls within the family game category, but it isn't really family friendly.  It's a fairly harsh 'take that!' game that often leaves my kids upset. One child (12 yrs) kills another child's (14 yrs) meeple and there is inevitable retaliation, which just escalates and escalates.  Also, what happens when the 8 year old's last meeple dies? Near tears is what.  Of course I could limit it to adults only but it would never get pulled off the shelf due to its family game veneer.

+ Easy rules
+ Fast gameplay

- Huge luck factor (turn tile get shark, roll dice, move shark)
- All vs One can have (combined with a bit of luck) huge impact when it happens wich ruins your game.
- Component quality (asmodee)

We found the dive dice from the expansion to be clunky.
As dived creatures must spawn at empty space it is only good for the squid or moving other monsters away. Can be meh when rolling to many dive dice.

[size=12][b]Why I like Survive: Escape from Atlantis![/b][/size]
+ I like how the "take that" is often spread out among all of the players so nobody feels targeted. 
+ I like the randomness in this game (a rarity) because the game is supposed to be a lightweight family game whereby the most strategic player can lose. 
+ I like the theme
+ The game is short
+ The game is easy to teach
+ The game has decent replayability.

[size=12][b]Fixable dislikes in regards to Survive: Escape from Atlantis![/b][/size]
/ I dislike memory games. There are nonetheless a few cheats you can use like rotating the meeples or positioning the higher values in a distinct spot
/ The rulebook is lacking. The FAQ I made addresses this issue. 
/ I would like the game more if the game had some extra land tiles so that certain tiles are randomly out of the game. I am a fan of variable set-ups after all. I suppose that I could get a second copy of the base game. 

[size=12][b]Why I dislike Survive: Escape from Atlantis![/b][/size]
- I would like the game more if there were variant green dolphin tiles (so that you can still use the red dolphin tiles) and if the whale tile referred to the squid too. I cannot fix this issue. 

[size=12][b]VERDICT:[/b] Keep & Sometimes willing to play this game[/size]

This game is so much fun and can be really funny to see everyone panic once their little meeples hits the water. Just dont get to emotionally attached because likely most of them will not see land again. Very exciting game and i have had a lot of fun with everyone i've played this game with.

Just a note to make and a big-up for Stronghold Games and Stephen Buonocore in specific. I had a busted game piece and emailed him to ask if they could assist me and he sent me all the way to South Africa a single board piece free of charge. Thats the kind of service i can get on board with (no pun intended) Great company and i recommend you go out and support them

Neat game about escaping the sinking island. You have a dozen or so numbered people that you are trying to position to get off the island easiest, but once you place them, you dont see the number again so trying to remember what numbers are where is challenging as are the hazards opponents can play to kill your people. Pretty fun!

Survive is a cutthroat game where players seek to evacuate their pieces from an island that is breaking up, while remembering where their highest-valued pieces are located to maximize their score.

An island made up of 40 hex-tiles is slowly sinking into the ocean (as the tiles are removed from the board). Each player controls ten people (valued from 1 to 6) that they try and move towards the safety of the surrounding islands before the main island finally blows up. Players can either swim or use boats to travel but must avoid sea serpents, whales and sharks on their way to safety.

I was quite disappointed with this game.

My (5 year old) nephew really enjoyed going after the other players with sharks and whales, which made the experience of playing it funny and memorable, but outside of that it wasn't much fun.

It's a light game that lacks the simplicity, brevity, or social interaction that makes those games fun for me and those I play with.

Took me a year before I had the opportunity to play it. Now that I know how much fun it is it will definately hit the table more often.

Houseruled it a little, instead of remembering your high value people and not being able to check you are allowed to make 1 check per turn to refresh your memory. That worked better than not being able to look at all or that all explorers are worth 1 point.

Played three time, 2p, 3p, 4p.  Good enough game, fairly abstract but tons of randomness.  I think I'd prefer if the 4, 5, and 6 value pieces were simply worth 1, 2, and 3 instead.  I'd play again, but I'm not aching to do so.

This is definitely one of my all-time favorite games - My friend introduced it a few years back, and it began the slippery slope of getting back into board games...  It was a fun concept, yet there was more to it than the  simple boardgames I had played in the past...   

Completely hooked on MANY new boardgames thanks to Survive!

RATING: 5.5
I think people mostly play this out of nostalgia.  It's a very light affair with tons of fluke, "take that!" and just plain random luck.  The theme is well integrated but overall it feels more like a chore than a game.  I'm not a big fan of "Forbidden Island" either, but that's basically a better more modern version of this, so you should look into it before getting Survive.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Quite a neat little game given that it's by Parker Brothers from 1982.  The theme is really loads of fun... that is until you get involved with sea monsters, sharks and whales.  It's a real blood bath as you fight and scramble to save your helpless minions.  If you add in the diplomacy factor, in serval ways this game reminds me of Survivor.

* Components
+ Nice, very thick tiles
- The meeples do not have the same shape, so it is not hard to remember which one is the 6-valued one, for instance.  Given the fact that meeple values must be remembered, players are actually encouraged to distinguish physical differences between meeples, and can learn them.  Giving players the same color each time helps, as they do not learn the value of the other player's meeples.
- One sea serpent was broken.  I glued the pieces.
- Two tiles had a creased corner, which makes the recognizable, which is not great.
- The box cover was new but damage: the paper covering was broken on the edge, because it creases (?) instead of bending.

* Feelings
- The luck factor is quite high, but there is room for more clever move and for some strategy. Some optimal moves are sometimes not seen immediately: the game requires some concentration, and sometimes some (limited) creativity.
+ The game is very thematic, which helps remembering the rules. Even somewhat counter-intuitive rules ("Squids like dry food only").
- The rulebook is quite complete (the FAQ is not too long), but the information is presented in an "item by item" fashion that does not give the big picture (for instance, I had missed the fact that Dolphins move along with Swimmers, because it was drowned in a list of a dozen points instead of being logically place closed to the "The Dolphins are the good guys" point.
+ The atmosphere of the game is light, with a lot of schadenfreude, exclamations, etc. A nice family game.
+ Setup and game play are both quite fast.

This is a family weight game that requires a great of deal of memory to remember which of your pieces are the ones that are valuable. I wish you could look at your own pieces during the game. Nothing super deep but it's fun to unleash the sea monsters on each other without it being a total luckfest.

The tiles are very thick but it is possible to see what type they are from a sharp angle. The wooden sharks, sea dragons, and whales are great.

Great light family game. With the 5-6 player expansion this game becomes extremely versatile. It plays best 3-5 players though. Success in the game is determined in part by luck (roll of the monster dice, good tile draws) but winning the game is often secondary to laughing with each other about your misfortunes. The game becomes a riot when people start naming their people and providing back stories before they meet a tragic fate with the sharks.

I still have this, but all the stickers fell off the meeples so it is no longer playable.


BETRAYAL. Simple, fun rules and a strong theme with lots of laughs.  Players control an army of little meeples that try to get off the island but also make decisions for monsters that move every turn, so players get pitted against each other while trying to save themselves.  A hex from the island is removed every turn, adding to the fun. This is a great game for casual players or a dinner party.

I really like this game, so I'm reluctant to trade it.  However, I know there's a lot of people who want this original edition, which includes the dolphin and dive dice.  I don't use them when I play, so I might be willing to trade this and buy myself a copy of the new set later on. 

This also includes the 5-6 player expansion pack.

RATING: 8
An older game where you are trying to move your people on a sinking island of Atlantis to the safety of nearby islands.  You have plenty of boats but sea monsters, sharks and whales make the game harder.  The dolphin expansion is important.  There are tons variants.  Very much a family weight game, but young kids are probably going to cry when you drop a sea monster on their boat with three of their people in it.

Highly interactive luck-fest.  Minimal strategy involved in placement of numbered figures.  After initial placement, any planning beyond a turn or two goes completely out the window, particularly with 3 or 4 player counts.  Significant element of metagame diplomacy, as gauging and attempting to influence others' behavior is very important.  Shows its age, for better or worse.

Very simple to play.  Tactical with some mean moves.  Plays up to 6, but you do lose a bit of control.  However, it is easy to overlook that since it is so much fun.

Update after 5 plays: This really deserves more plays.  The table talk in each game is so much fun.  Alliances flying left and right.  People threatening to get payback when they're screwed over.  This is what a light, fun, social game should be.

Just the sheer number of people on here that own this game should tell you JUST HOW GOOD this game is!!  

Kind of surprising, considering all the people on here that bash Milton Bradley and Parker Brothers games...  

This is certainly one of Parker Brothers best...  a fun game even with 2-players, but of course, 4 is the tops!!

For such an easy game to learn how to play, there is plenty of strategy... and the fun abounds when someone gets "Eaten" by the Sea Serpent!!  

I would recommend giving this game a try to ANYONE!!

One of the most vicious and cutthroat games I have ever played.  Lots of way to screw over your friends, but surprisingly very diplomatic.  Table talk is highly encouraged and you will need to temporarily ally with people, otherwise you will have the entire board against you.  Extremely easy to teach and does fall within the 30 to 45 minute timeframe.  The only main issue with the game is it doesn't have a lot of meat to it, so gamers who want a more thinking involved in a 45 minute timeframe could look at other options like King of New York or Ra.

Survive is exactly what it sounds like: pure, lighthearted fun, with lots of opportunities for screwing each other over, narrow escapes, and surprises.

Bluffing about the value of your people (as well as potentially forgetting their value) and holding tiles for later use add some strategy, and the game is short enough and simple enough that it feels just right.

The 3D effect created by the varying tile heights is nice, and the components are top-notch across the board.

LOVE this game! What a classic! If you're into blood sport, Survive is right up your alley. This game is straight-up brutal, but so much fun. You have to go into it with a light heart. Otherwise, the game could escalate into a brawl/divorce, depending on who you are playing with. Typically, I'm not a big fan of direct conflict in games. I only like direct conflict in light games or games that are specifically designed to create conflict. This games meet both criteria. It's fun and light, but it's also supposed to be confrontational. Survive also affords a surprising amount of strategic planning. To be sure, a good memory assists in this planning, but it's not necessary to play well. Add great bits, smooth gameplay and play time under 1 hour, and this gem jumps from great to fantastic. 

P.S. I've only played this as a 2 player so far. I can't wait to play with more!

Update 4/26/14: 

I played with 4 tonight. To be honest, I don't know that it's better with 4 than 2. There's definitely more chaos and less strategy (due to lack of control). It just depends on what type of mood you are in. If you want a straight-up brawl, then 4 is very good. But if you're in the mood for a cutthroat, albeit fun chess match, then two is perfect.

RATING: 7
I've only gotten to play it once so far. I like the theme here, but the game just left something to be desired for me. Perhaps its simplicity merits a shorter gameplay. Or perhaps i was just having a bad night. Whatever it is, apparently it's just me, so i really should give this one another chance. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is possibly the ultimate late-night game of drunken chaos. There's just enough strategy to keep the brain engaged and meanwhile it's laugh a minute as your poor meeples get dumped in the sea and consumed by a variety of marine life, ably backed up by the tension injected into the game through hidden scoring. But, amazingly, the huge amount of variants included in the rules also make it a great family game if you put in all the ones that make it less cut-throat and more peaceable.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.77
More chaotic for my taste than I would like, but it can be offset by at least remembering where you placed your higher point meeples. It is easy enough to get people into the game and has been a hit so far with others who have played it. It just feels very decent is all.

I am terrible at this game.

Good family fun.  My 8 year old relishes the potential for screwage, whilst the entire thing is simple enough for my 6 year old to cope with as well.  Very very popular.  And the in box dolphin expansion makes it even better.

Disappointments mainly from  slightly off production quality:  Meeples roughly hewn and poorly painted; board hefty but easily dinged and scuffed (a problem for a sliding round the board meeple based game -a harder linen finish would have been much more sensible;mountain pieces poorly printed/cut (the latter sorted by the 5/6 expansion - a bonus undermined by the meeple in that expansion being plastic with paper base stickers.

Almost perfect; but would have benefited from as much care in the manufacture as in the (re)design.

The mean-spirited classic. Old game but it was ahead of its time, easily could've come out in 90's. Good gateway game for people who are used to roll-and-move and aren't quite ready for TTR. It has great social aspect and enough chaos to even biggest skill differences out. For that purpose it has a permanent place in our collection.

Great family game or even a gateway game. May need to be careful if you play with small children as they may take it personal when you eat there guy with a shark.

But all in all a fun feed your neighbor to the sharks game.

Fantastic game. Forget strategy and swim for it! Seriously, a fun, laugh out loud game as you cheer your meeples on, hoping they won’t get eaten. 

Definitely best with 3 or 4 people so you get more interaction (and more bad things!) but does play fine with 2 as well. 

This is all about theme as you imagine Jaws or the Loch Ness Monster coming after everyone. If you’re actually thinking about which meeples have the high point values, you’re doing it wrong – focus on the fun people!

Though the random tiles and dice make each game different, it’s really the same. As such, there can be too much of a good thing, but it’s fun to bring out from time to time to goof off. 

Great production value – nice board, components and rule book.  Easy to teach/learn, plays quick. No bash the leader and no AP issues.

My favorite game from childhood. In fact, I bought the new game to replace my long-lost childhood board. Chaos, death, meeples devoured by sharks, boats mauled by whales, volcanic islands erupting... What is not to love??!! Quick play time, tight mechanics, a super fun screw 'em game which make this a must play for anyone. Edit: 11/8/11. Played my first 3 player game. It is definitely more fun with 2 or 4 players (2 player variant, each player removes two tiles from the island), feels slightly off-balance with 3 players. All our meeples had escaped or been eaten waaay before we pulled the mountain tiles, so the fun of destroying the island was lost. Still fun!

Obviously there's the '[i]With the right bunch of people[/i]' preambulum before every game, but it's essential to mention with Survive. Polite people will kill the fun of it, touchy people will punch you in the face. If you don't have the right group, you should hold a seminar beforehand about the joy of viciousness, because the point of the game is to stepping on toes, while saving your bacon. 
So, with the right bunch of people this simple and chaotic game is pure fun.

A little gem of a game. A remake of the 1980 classic Parker Bros game. It's not complicated and it's somewhat random but it's extremely playable. 

Stronghold has re-issued it with really beautiful components. You race to get your wooden meeples off the sinking island of Atlantis and see them swim or boat to safety on neighbouring atolls.

Each island tile you sink has a hazard on the other side, in the form of whales, sharks, whirlpools and sea serpents which go into the water and come after your swimmers. You win this game by eating your opponent's meeples before they can get to safety. Fun! Ok with two.  Best with four.

A bit confrontational which is typically not my thing, but the game is light and fun enough that it doesn't bother me here.  I also like the memorization aspect of placing the meeples, although I'm terrible at remembering most of mine.  The varied-depth hex tiles are fantastic and the overall play feels tight and engaging.  The meeple components could be better -- the originals varied in size a bit, potentially "marking" them.  The replacements with the 5-6 player add-on were consistently-sized but had little paint smudges on them, presenting them same problem.  Overall, great game if you want something lightweight with a nice mix of temporary alliances, occasional back-stabbing, and some luck.

There is certainly a kind of maniacal glee that goes along with this game, something I haven't seen in other games of this type, cutthroat games.  Usually leading to hurt feelings in my group (and hence a leaning toward more cooperative or one v many games), this one has taken root in our group as a new fan-favorite.  Watching the dice get rolled every turn and hoping "notmenotmenotmenotme" never seems to get old, and has the added effect of somehow causing folks not to hate the guy who just capsized their boat with the whale, but immediately regroup and come up with a new strategy.  For its age (I have the old 1982 PB copy), it is WAY ahead of its time and has held up exceedingly well.  Survive is a pretty grim world if you think about it, but it is incredibly fun and uncomplicated.

RATING: 6
Game in a Nutshell: Escape from a dissolving island by securing spots on boats and evading a number of monsters in your way.

Played as: 4 player.

Pros: The theme fits this game like a glove. The race for the boats instills a sense of panic as if the island really was disintegrating under your own feet. Conflict and tension is forced upon players; sometimes so much that it feels better to see the other boats fall victim to a sea monster then relief of getting your own men home safe.

Cons: Awful rule book, don't count on knowing what should happen towards the end of the game. Possibly could benefit from some streamlining: less pawns to move and a smaller island could cause things to pick up as there would be fewer choices to make with the limited actions given. As is, the whole game could come to a screeching halt with only one AP player.

Other: I wish I would have known they made games like this back in the day. I think even a modern remake would stand for some positive attention today.

Best Use: I'm guessing there would be no finer use for this then as a family game with the kids.

The 8 rating is based on several plays, mostly with two players. It is light, fun, easy to learn and entertained the whole family. A neat game idea, well executed.

If all Euros aspired to this level of quality, tension, screwage and theme, the genre wouldn't be so laughably lame to me. It proves that Euro and Euroish games can have interesting themes with well-matched mechanics that--gasp!--make it fun to play. There are no viziers or brown cubes or granaries or textile markets to be seen here. Just frickin' sharks and sea monsters gobbling up swimmers as an island sinks into the ocean. 

The new edition looks great and (I think, maybe I'm wrong) has a few unnecessary changes and additions. There was nothing wrong or in need of fixing about the old edition. Not that the new edition is bad, but...why?

26-Jan-2014:  I still this is a great game and would recommend it to any family or group looking for a light-hearted, fun gotcha-style of game.

Unfortunately, my family doesn't seem to enjoy the "gotcha" aspect of this game, even though it's all in good fun.  Because of this, we've only played this game twice in 2013 and not since June.  My kids, and even my wife, get annoyed when I send Sharks and Whales after their little Meeples.  And if I take out a boat that has both my dude and someone else's because I know it's a high scoring one...yikes!  I'm in trouble then.

I try to explain to them, that's the whole point of the game.  Meeples get eaten throughout the game!  It's all just for fun.

Oh well.  Just keep that in mind.  If your group can't handle direct conflict, even with cute little Shark meeples and Sea Monsters, then I'm sad to say this may not work for you.

If that's not an issue, then this game is great, and has awesome components.  Go get it.

08-Feb-2013: This was a family favorite...at first.  This was another one of my early purchases when getting into the hobby and my family definitely enjoyed it.  The gameplay was unique to use with the sinking island.  The components are fabulous with the various sharks, whales, sea monsters, meeples, and boats all made of wood.

Everyone starts with 10 people on a sinking island and you must get as many as you can to surrounding land before the volcano on the island explodes.  Each meeple has a point value assigned to it, and you'll have to remember who is who throughout the game as the numbers are hidden during play.  Unfortunately, all of the players are allowed to control the various sea creatures in the water which attack your meeples, eating them up and destroying the boats they are using to escape.

If you do not like direct conflict, you may not like this game.  As I said, my family really liked this at first.  It was so different and new to us, no one payed attention to the direct attacks between players.  But over time and several plays, my wife and kids became less enamored when their meeples would be devoured by a sea monster.  I always played the game as a light, fun experience where you expect to lose a lot of your pawns.  If you take it as a fun, family gotcha game, you should get a lot out of this.  If you take it too seriously, you could be in trouble with your kids.

MAYHEM! Must DIY this. Look, this is clearly not a modern design - for one thing, the variation in point values of the little guys is a bit much, and it was suggested that there would be more strategy if one could peek at those values during the game. But, it's really just about perfect for what it is. You're going to lose a lot of guys. So you have to make tough choices. There's lots of screwage, and it's done right. And, as my daughter observed, the different point values do essentially remove any potential kingmaker problem. Plus cool bits... it's just sweet.

The game that brought me to the Geek. I remember many many plays of this against my mom as a kid (she, of course, doesn't remember the game at all) and a hankering for it got me to create an account here to ask what the name of it was. 

Recent plays have shown it to still be enjoyable, if a bit too inconsequential for the amount of time spent setting up/playing. With four people it's chaotic and violent -- and can get nasty. Which is a good thing.

+.5 the boats combined with indiscriminate threats add a small element of collaboration and collusion 

+.5 novelty of eating drowning seamen with sharks or sea-monsters and general 'gotcha!' mechanics are done in a  satisfying and fun way

-2 beyond the subtle stuff, it's not too deep strategy wise, and isn't the most repayable game ever. 
 

A fun game to break out in groups that like novel themes and shallow (no pun intended) dudes on a map games.

See Survive: Escape from Atlantis when available

Set up an island from tiles and place pieces on it. Turns consist of moving your pieces, sinking a piece of an island, and moving a monster. You are trying to get your pieces from the central island to a corner island for scoring.

When the volcano tile is flipped, the game ends!

Sounds good for kids as well.

A very nice party game. Best with four players, the more the merrier. Lots of back stabbing and ruthless take that - mentalism but when done with humour it is just so much fun. Players really feel like rats on sinking ship and do whatever they can to escape the island and the predators of the ocean. It is not a complex game and luck plays a big role so that must be considered when you think of buying it.

Hát ez óriási! :)
Egy valami böki a csőröm: ha kipécéznek, esélyed sincs. Velem ez történt az első játék alkalmával (mindig én vagyok az ellenség, ez a játék pedig adja a lovat), azóta pedig az előző játék nyertese, aki a legnagyobb törődésben részesül. Ez egy brutál tréning sértődőseknek (még nekem is kezdett sok lenni első játék alkalmával a csesztetés, pedig én bírom a gyűrődést).
Ezektől eltekintve gyönyörű, rendkívül minőségi játék. Gondolkodni nagyon ne akarjunk, csak érezzük jól magunkat!

Első BGG Marketplace-es rendelésem alkalmával be is rendeltem a kiegészítőit, legközelebb azokat is bedobjuk a vízbe!

Simple,  fun family game. Those who have a better memory and can remember which are their most valuable meeples have a fair advantage, if they have good poker face so as to not let other players know where your best point scorers are. Has become a fixture in my top 10 and has been out the longest. Glad Stronghold did remake and 30th Anniversary edit. is now the one I use.   Kind of a tough, cutthroat/take that element to it.. 
   
I like the Squid and Dolphin/dive dice expansions and use them sometimes  The 5th and 6th payer expansion makes the board very crowded.  I seldom use it as I usually play with 4. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This game rocks.  Good components, direct player conflict and interaction, fairly quick playtime, and really good 3-6 players.  We own all the expansions but, in my estimation, the only one you might need is the 5-6 player expansion (and that's only if you think you'll want to play with more than 4 players).

2 player is a middling experience at best, but otherwise a great game.

Wow, what a game, can't believe this is from 1982!  The new version has stellar production. This is a game I'd never part with.  Stronghold should try to get this into regular stores.

RATING: 8
This Euro-thematic hybrid is very popular. Making use of a modular board, Escape requires the players to get a team of their people off the island, which slowly sinks over time, to the safety of the 4 distant forms of land in the corner of the board. 

What makes the game so much fun is that the players have duel roles. As well as trying to save as many of their people as possible, they are also trying to help kill the meeple of their opponents. 

They can do this by moving the various sharks, whales and squids to intercept meeple. 

The other thing going for the game is that each meeple a person controls is worth a certain value. Those points are only earned when a meeple gets to safety. So the players are trying to kill as many enemy meeple as possible, but they really want to stop the high-valued ones from getting to safety. 

This can lead to all manner of mind games as the players try to bluff and double bluff by making moves that may seem like a meeple is worth high points when in fact it isn't. 

This is good family fun and kids particularly delight in wiping out their parents meeple.

Theme is excellent, fun to play, and doesn't overstay it's welcome.  I consider this a great gateway game in the same vein as Ticket to Ride.  
You pull out this game if the group your playing with can take a game that has a bit more luck, but offers a fun theme with a 'take that' element.
You pull out TtR if the group your playing with wants a little more control of their destiny, and doesn't like as much in your face confrontation.

I don't know exactly what it is about this game, but it makes it to the table more often than most of my collection. Some of the things I like about it:
Visually gorgeous
Great Bits
Relaxed quick gameplay (usally 2 players controlling 2 colors each)
The "take that" aspect doesn't feel personal or vindictive...if your swimming in shark infested waters, you should expect the inevitable. ;)
There is just enough strategy and sneakyness to make it feel strategy rather than luck driven.
The theme and mechanics mesh perfectly.

All said, this is one of my favorite light weight games. :)

A good, solid, family level game. Random enough that anyone can play and have a fighting chance, but strategic enough to where you aren't just blindly swimming for shore and hoping you don't get eaten.

A favourite amongst my stash of games.  If my island were sinking, I would surely grab this game before dashing down to the beach!

It has been said by the 'losers' of my gaming group that there is a large amount of luck within this game, which I cannot deny given the tile removing mechanic and dice, and that it does reward a player with a good memory and 3D cognitive skills.  Apparently, that doesn't constitute 'strategy' ...

Not for the faint of heart.  This game CAN destroy families.  You have been warned!

This game can get mean really fast, but it never feels particularly personal, and it's really easy to get revenge.  Lots of fun, although watch out for those whose feelings get hurt easily.

I also own the 5-6 player and Giant Squid expansions.

Survive: Escape From Atlantis is easy to learn, simple to play, has beautiful components, and I don't want to own it. The game-play is well structured and achieves exactly the experience it sets out to. Unfortunately it is not an experience that I enjoy.

S:EfA is just too mean. To win you must kill off other players meeples and, as the meeples value is hidden, you need to kill off several to feel confident of any kind of lead. This kind of assurance is rarely felt, so players will literally wipe out boatloads of competitors meeples even to the point of wiping out all of a player's meeples.

Games that induce a 'To win I must kill you' feeling I don't enjoy.

We played this game with all additions, which got a bit hectic.  The game was fun for what it was, and did not seem to overstay it's welcome, but it just fell felt a bit for me. 

I do like the idea that all your survivors are worth different point totals and you strive to get the ones worth the most to the island...if you forget which was the highest, take a guess!

There was also quite a bit of screwing over your neighbor which can be tough for me, but it's short enough that it doesn't seem to hurt the game.

Gioco semplice ma cattivo con una forte interazione. Simpatica a mio avviso la componente mnemonica per portare a riva i personaggi con il valore segreto più elevato. A incidere in maniera predominante è però la casualità nel tiro del dato (per muovere draghi marini, balene o squali) e in cosa possiamo trovare sotto le tessere che si stanno inabissando (da una scialuppa di salvataggio a uno squalo). Giochino introduttivo che fa dell'immediatezza e della semplicità i propri punti di forza.

[b]Survive[/b] was traded away in a math trade 3/17/15. (Received Camel Up) Back in the collection and was sold via auction 10/15/16.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Unfortunately this stopped seeing play in favor of other gateway games with extended family (Camel Up and Diamant to name a few) so I traded it away. In my opinion this is still a great game to introduce to family and friends that are new to the hobby. I definitely prefer it over The Downfall of Pompeii. My kids inquired about this game recently and said they missed playing it. Fortunately I was able to pick up a copy in a local math trade.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- A great introductory family game as long as your family can deal with some take that game play.
- I have found that it plays well with 2, we each play 3 colors and use the overcrowded variant. This helps ensure lots of meeples getting eaten.
- Extremely easy to teach, making it a great family game.
- Beautiful components, especially the sea creatures.[/i]

Very easy to explain, and creates great thematic play as everyone scrambles to get off the sinking island. Not a lot of depth, but makes up for that somewhat by having you care about what other people are doing.

A game where you have to save as your tribe from a sinking island while avoiding whales, sharks, and sea serpents, before the island explodes.  My favourite game when I was young.  When I couldn't get people to play it with me, I developed a solitaire variant so I could play it alone.

Fantastic game! It's too bad that video games came out in the late 80's, otherwise this game might have been a trendsetter in a good way!
Easy to learn, but for cutthroat players it can get quite viciously enjoyable!

Surprisingly fun! Played cousin-in-law's copy over Christmas and even conflict-averse GF had a good time (she won 2 out of 2, though, so that may be why!). In this game it feels like you really don't have a choice: you *must* be nasty, so it's not really nasty.

I still really like the original old classic Survive. My wife however, cannot stop playing the new reprint with the Escape from Atlantis rules and Squids! I really love the original artwork of the box and board and she really loves the new box art and board! So there you have it...for what it's worth. I suspect the new version will be the one we end up playing the most. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.2
These old classics really do deserve a new printing and people deserve a chance to play them! Stronghold games has done an excellent job with the board artwork and components. My wife thinks the game now looks as beautiful as Tobago. I enjoy playing with the Escape from Atlantis rules and the Squids. These added bonuses to the original game create a glorious experience of human carnage. What with the sharks, whales, squids, sea serpents and volcano...how are these people to survive? The dolphins and boats offer a little assisance...but p-lease...your people are in serious trouble! This game now reminds me a lot of Downfall of Pompeji...another favorite of ours.

With 2 players we play with the variant of drawing 2 tiles per turn. It is perfect and doesn't in any way disturb the game.

Excellent jeu où il est impératif d'être méchant et sans pitié avec ses adversaires. Superbe matos avec de grosses tuiles, des pions en bois différents pour les bestiaux. Un jeu où il faudra de la chance, de la mémoire, de la diplomatie pour s'en sortir.

A ne pas pratiquer avec des joueurs rancuniers ou ayant mauvais caractère. 

La fin de partie brutale est un peu dommage car tous les joueurs n'auront pas le même tour de jeu.

A fantastic family game.  The components can make it seem like it might be overly complex, but even the old folks that generally don't play games more complex than Uno were able to pick up the rules and really get into the game.

Winning this game is almost all about luck.  I don't even try to win.  I just try to make the game harder for everyone else by breaking all the boats and getting the meeples in the water.  Of course I lose every game like this but holy shit do I love seeing my friends facepalm and rage when I move our boat INTO a whale and shark tile.  Priceless.

Outstanding !! Women, men, young and older WILL enjoy this colorful every-meeple-for-themselves sinking island-tile game. I actually love the wooden pieces, the thick tiles of various heights, and the tightening of the redone rules.

Gateway Game! Family Game! Beer-N-Pretzels Game! This plays fine for 2, but is much better with more players.

Kudos and thanks to Stronghold for reprinting this classic.

I wish to play the 2012 30th anniv edition to compare its graphics to the 2011. The 2011 graphics are merely okay, but the components and gameplay are worth it.  The 2011 edition also have some "variants", one using dolphin-meeples.

RATING: 3
What I liked:
- Great components

What I didn't like:
- Cutthroat play. People have said it doesn't feel cutthroat, but they are wrong.
- Highly random, which is ok in a filler, but not in a 90 minute game like the one we had.
- Too long. A 4p learning game of a random filler like this should be 45 minutes tops.
- Too confusing to be a great gateway game.
- The pacing is not great, as you can have all the boats show up at the end, or on one side of the board.

I would put the weight a bit higher than 1.7, as it is definitely harder to understand than Forbidden Island or Jaipur.

Based on one play: Be sure not to take the game too seriously and know that you have no friends when trying to escape a sinking island with sea monsters. You move your meeples around and try to get on boats to get to shore, however sea monsters appear and are controlled by others. Try and get you more valuable meeples off, if you can remember which ones they are.

This game is a romp.  Don't look here for serious strategy--Survive is all about frantically trying to escape while tripping up your opponents' attempts to.  Because of hidden information, you never know how much you're helping or hurting your opponents.  While I don't always enjoy this style of game, Survive is very good at what it does, and I think it's good fun as a evening-ending wind-down game.

My most played game, racking up well over 20 games in the last 3 months.

A simple, elegant system that is both a friendly gateway game and remarkably cut throat. No matter who is playing, from a novice to a pro gamer after just one intro game all players will be sinking each others boats, enticing sharks over to their opponents swimmers or slowly pushing the sea monsters towards their next meal!

I can't recommend enough

One of my favorite games from my childhood.

This is actually a great game - you have an island which is falling into the ocean and you don't know when the game will end.  You can play tough against others but you never know who will win because only you know the value of the pieces you are moving, but not the value of the opponents pieces.

Loved this game as a kid... my brother and I would bring this to the racquetball club and play in the lounge while my father played racquetball. Good times.

Could not wait for the reprint... and I wasn't disappointed. Components are terrific... I am in love with the different height terrain tiles, which are pretty cool and nice to look at aesthetically. Game play is pretty much the same as I remember the original -- get your people off the sinking island and try to avoid the roving whales, sharks and sea serpents. Not a ton of depth play-wise, but the nostalgia factor bumps it up a bit.

Played this with some people that are not the biggest fans of cutthroat games and this still went over very well.  Odds are if I played this with more cutthroat players that are willing to attack others at all times then this will jump to a 9.  This for me is up there with Spartacus, Food Chain Magnate, and Ave Caesar for fun cutthroat games while also filling in that perfect void I was missing of a game that can be played in about an hour.

*** Traded for Arkadia ***

$35

--- Includes 5&6player expansion ---

Initial 2 player game with girlfriend made me feel this game deserves a 7/10 rating. Maybe it needs a little bit more players to make it chaotic and fun. 

It is a very nice game with a bit of "take that". The confrontation feels pretty not personal since the game requires us to play it in a very cut throat-y manner. I think this game is a good training wheel game to get my family members to get used to "take that" mechanics in games. They need to learn it is nothing personal.

---- Update ----
Played a 6 player game, the game drags a bit long, but is more fun in the "meta-game" side where negotiation and back-stabbing happens compared to a 2-player game.
Rating goes up from 7 to 8.

---- Update ----
With lukewarm reaction from the game group after only handful of plays this drops back down to a 7. I think this is not suitable for our game group because couples don't turn on each other and in result makes the game bland and unbalanced.

---- Update ----
This is definitely a "depends on your game group" kind of game. My family is not that kind of in your face group so this couldn't hit the table and 2-player with fiancee is just straight mean. Traded in a math trade.

RATING: 8.1
What a great game, excellent mechanics, looks amasing, the quality of the parts is very good, but the best thing is trying to save our meeples at the same time that we try to sabotage all the opponents meeples and everyone is doing that with lots of laughters.

Just got one play under my belt with a 2 player game and I have to say This is a Great game! 4 player would be best as there will be way more screwing over going on. Easy to learn and play. Bottom line, you cant go wrong with this game.
Just back updating the rating on this,,,This game is just pure fun,No reason why it shouldnt be a Ten!

A game I picked up a long while ago so I really was looking to play it. I heard it is so mean and cruel. You are trying to kill off the other players. Everyone has secret values under their guys so you never really know what they are up to. Pretty abstract but cool bits. I look forward to playing again. Could be a good family game.

Fun! Reasonably simple and a little cut throat - but fun. 

It is really possible to find yourself being hammered and there's nothing you can do about it but even that can be funny you're in the right spirit. If you think that the people you're playing with might take it a little personally, then don't use the numbers printed on the bottom. 

Very good pieces.

This is a very vicious but at the same time a fun game! How can you not have fun capsizing your opponents' life boats and feeding their men to the sharks and the sea monsters?

Generally, I'm not fond of games with too much luck and randomness, and this one has both, but I still enjoy playing it once in a while.

The plastic components in its "Atlantis" incarnation are a lot more fun to play with than Survive!'s original cardboard tiles.

Chaotic flight for safety; little time for strategy, just try and get your people to safety. Can be a bit cutthroat at times; some players might get bent out of shape about it. Some variant rules exist to make it a little more or less nasty.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a very cute game, where players get meeples with different scoring numbers printed at the base. On a player's turn they remove part of the island, then move some of their meeples, trying to escape to the safe shores, then the roll a die to determine what monsters they activate if any. The quality of the components in the edition I had was quite nice, but no matter how many times I play this game, I can never remember which of my meeples are high scoring and which are low. The game plays like a chaotic mess. Players are incentivized to work together to escape on the boats, but only one player ultimately wins. The monster effects wind up being a blind punch the player you feel like punching, since your opponents have no idea about what your score is until the end of the game.

This is a funny game that doesn't last too long, but after 7 plays I got tired of it. It's not normally my sort of game, but it was worth a laugh for awhile.

This game was a great additon to my teenage games playing--our family loved it! A charming premise of getting your people off a sinking island (swimming or in boats), avoiding pitfalls like sharks, whales, sea-monsters, whirlpools and finally, the volcanic explosion! Nice game play wraps in around an hour. Much more fun with 4 people as the island sinks more quickly. (Each turn someone removes one hexagonal island piece, starting with beaches, then forest, then mountain. The more people playing the faster the island sinks.)

This game is fun, but very mean. The theme is fun and intuitive, and the mechanics work well together. Every player takes several actions during their turn that are supposed to screw over some of the other players. You can get enough control over the game to not get really frustrated at getting screwed over, but don't play this game with people who will take it personally.

8 - This game is mean, this game is challenging, and this game does not care about the lives of your survivors. Go in with that understanding and it's a blast.  Send the sharks after swimmers, sink ALL the boats, release the serpent quickly and people will groan and laugh and cry when they've saved 3 1's and a 2 while someoen else saved their 5 and 6.

A surprisingly good game from the early 80's. It mechanisms that are well received today. It is a light strategy game with a good element of take that. There is a hint of cooperative play with boats and lot of take that as the sea-creatures close and take out your opponents.  
Finally it has some good looking bits - meeples, sea monsters, shark fins, whale tails.
If you see it at the thrift store don't think twice grab it.

Glad to see it was republished

[ESP] Muy divertido, y con mucho take that pero sin sentirse tan agresivo ya que básicamente cada turno puedes eliminar los meeples de tus contrarios, dejando tomar revancha rápidamente. Muy bueno para iniciar jugadores, y con algo de estrategia si es que recuerdas bien los valores de los meeples.

Cutthroat but cute.

It's so cute that nobody minds dying a sudden death, especially if there's some story and monster noise for entertainment too. lol.

When the boat is filled with three meeples each from different players, we call that the "international" boat. Usually, the international boat goes nowhere. lol. Also, when a boat has two of the player's colors, we call that "juicy". They are usually eaten because it's so tempting. Best survival chance is alone or with another player.

Some ideas I had: [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/617994/more-challenge-rules-perfect-game]My Variant[/url]

The game box artwork is fantastic, the board tile artwork leaves a little to be desired, however.  This is a "good" game.. but I am not overly inspired to play for anything except maybe a change in pace.  I do like the theme.  And maybe with more plays I can figure what it is that makes me somewhat lukewarm about it.  I know I was not thrilled to see the ability to play with 5-6 players served out as an "expansion" that had to be bought for additional cost.  Am happy it is in my collection, however.

Played with two - I think I will enjoy this more with more people.

3 Players - 7 - Still pretty good, but not as good as with four.

2 Players - 5 - Look, there's just not enough going on with two. It's too easy to just avoid each other.

Wow, what slaughter fest. This is just chaotic fun for 30-45 minutes. The more players, the less control you have.

Wouldn't want to play this one often at all, but it was enjoyable, and I would definitely play it again in the future.

Simple game.   A little cut-throat.  It seems to be a little overrated based on what it is, but it definitely has some good theme.   When you see your little guys out in the ocean, you want to get them to safety.

I do think this game is a little too mean-spirited.  Playing your best game often involved destroying your opponents boat and drowning his swimmers.....this can be a little aggressive/confrontational, especially when playing with kids.  For this reason, the last time I played it, I swore I would never play it again.

this game is really a great game.  Way ahead of its time.  It has a nice balance of theme, abstract, memory and luck.  

Update for 30th Anniversary edition-  first off, this addition is beautiful and very functional.  Some of the setup has been simplified and the game play has been tweaked a little but plays the same as the 1982 version.along with my comments above it just a fun game where the theme can generate some laughs too.

I only came to know about this game after Spiel 10. I was a bit disappointed that I had missed it on the fair, so I was very eager to get a copy this year. But then in the days before Spiel 11 I learned that the game would be sold out all together. So I skipped it from my to buy list. Then I heard that the publisher would have a few copies with them, I was very excited. I only came across the Stronghold booth at friday, and when I learned what the prices was, I couldn't resist and bought my copy with expansion.

yesterday evening I had my first survive expirience and it was exactly what I expected it to be. A very nice entertaining game, lot's of fun and a lot of anoying the other players in a way I really like. The game components look beautiful in a simple way, which gives the game a really good feeling. 
The only thing is that you should play this only with people who like to anoy one another, because if you don't, then it would be rather dull, I think. So if you can eat a swimmer with a shark, or throw a boat over with a whale, do it, just because you can.

Simple game in which players attempt to escape from a sinking island. The meeples of each player are worth different points, try to get your most valuable to shore without revealing them to the other players and risking attack by shark, whale, or sea monster.

This is a really great "family-style" game.  The rules are easy enough to learn and the upgraded components in the 30th anniversary edition really do the game justice.  The theme is fun and it takes under an hour to play with 4-5 players.  The only thing detracting from this game is the possibility for the game to be quite cutthroat (though this is entirely up to the decisions of the players, coupled with a few optimally placed tiles and rolls of the monster die).

This is a fantastic and fun game. It's not one that you should play if you want everything to be able to be planned out. Very "take that" and need to be played with people that can handle obvious and deliberate actions to be taken against them. On the other hand, you may end up in a boat with 2 others and have to cooperate with them in order to help get your person to safety. "Winning" seems to be secondary to the experience and game play.

I remember my best mate getting the original version of this game for Christmas back when it came out in 1986. I LOVED the game back then. As the years went by, I quite forgot about the fun we had playing this one - so imagine my suprise when I went to a games convention and found this game in the games library that we could play! Well, I couldn't grab the game quickly enough :) 

For me, this review is a mix of objectiveness and nostalgia. The current incarnation hasn't changed that much from the original version I remember (the spinner for moving creatures is now a dice, the middle island could be a lot more random back then). The game is fairly simple to play, basically just moving your people as quickly as you can to the safety of the islands on the edges of the board. But the ability to send monsters to interfere with your opponents is where the fun of this game comes in! Of course, it's not so much fun when they send a shark towards your clump of swimmers.....

Overall, I think this is a great game to play once in a while. While not a go-to game, it is a great "lighter" game - one to play between heavier thinking games perhaps. Probably deserves a 7, but it gets an extra point from me for the extreme nostalgia factor!

I love games in which you can benefit from other players' moves. If you have one survivor in a boat with two of an opponent's survivors, you can rely on that opponent to move the boat. Thus, your survivor moves without you having to use part of your turn, increasing your action economy. Also, you have a second person fighting to keep the whales, sharks, and sea monsters away from that boat.

Better still, have a boat with only TWO survivors: one of yours and one belonging to an opponent. You can both move the boat, so it can reach the shore more quickly than a boat controlled by only one person.

I love this sort of begrudging cooperation.

This is a surprisingly quick game, which has a good degree of competitiveness without feeling vindictive (i.e. a good compromise between my love of wargames and my partner's pacifism).  I have the older version with plastic island pieces, and I think the new board feels a little bland by comparison.  That said, my box is second-hand, and has pieces from several different versions, leading to some confusion regarding the 'official' rules - I have never played with the same rules twice!

The reprint looks to have all the features of the previous versions of the game in a nicely produced package.

Fun game.  Impossible to not play ruthlessly.  Really, in my experience, the game is all about seeing what tragedy happens to everybody and not so much trying to win.

15-06-2014. Rated after about 10+ plays. What is there to say? What is more fun than trying to save your dudes from drowning on a sinking island by trying to sail them to safe shores..

Basically, you can move your guys off the island into ships. You try to save them from sharks and sea monsters. If you ever occupy a spot with one of your monsters, your guy is dead. Whilst on the way to the island, they're fishfood.. err eaten. 

This game used to be one of my favorite gateway games. I must say, I haven't played it in 6 months. So while it easily was one of my favorite games, it's slipped significantly from 8 to 6.

--Jan2012-- The random tile setup made it seem even more random than [thing=24037][/thing]; I suspect the impression is partially false (in that any given tile setup just informs placement decisions) but the end-of-game reveal is definitely less predictable.  It's harmless.

To help randomise the positions of the island tiles and to prevent positional bias - we do the following: starting with all terrain tiles face down and shuffled, work in a spiral around the centre of the island and working round in a clockwise fashion increasing the spiral with each finished circle - roll 1d6 to give the following results: 1 or 2 = position a beach tile, 3 or 4 = position a forest tile, 5 or 6 = position a mountain tile.  if ever a terrain type is used up then use 1, 2, 3 for the lower level terrain and 4, 5,6 for the higher level terrain.

*edit* I think I'm willing to admit that Survive is one of those games I have for other people, rather than for myself. There is something rather arbitrary about the game. That quality has its charm, but it also pulls some of the meaning from player decisions. It's still a fun game, but only really in the goofy "screw you" way. That's enough sometimes I suppose.

Survive is the perfect game for families who enjoy some friendly competition. The rules are very straightforward, but there is a lot of room for fun screwage and playful banter. There's not a lot of depth to the game, just lots of good times. It's not hard to see why the game was a mainstream hit in the 1980's. 

The reprint by Stronghold games is an absolute home-run. The components are all great. My only complaint is the language-independent tiles. A little cheat-sheet would have been nice.

This game is pure, wonderful cruelty wrapped up in a fancy-looking package. The strategy in this game is somewhat muted - you basically scramble to shore, knocking your opponents over when you can - and yet what's there is constantly fun. There's even an element of negotiation as you form brittle alliances (often by jumping unannounced into other players' boats) and plead for someone to send the sharks somewhere else.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Rated after one play (four players).  Shows definite promise.  Has some Tigris and Euphrates Syndrome, in that the amount of stuff that can happen between two of your turns makes planning difficult or impossible, which makes me suspect that it (like T&E) might be best with two players.  Also not sold on the whirlpools, which seem to add an unneeded element of crapshootery.  Finally, I don't see the point of the rule that you can't look at your pieces' values during the game - turns what's otherwise reasonably strategic into a game of memory.

Want to play again to develop further impressions.

The sinking island should be cool. I should be overlooking the chaos and just enjoy the experience, but ultimately I find myself wondering why I'm not using this time playing something that's more fun, less chaotic, less mean and more meaningful. It'd probably be a hoot with the kids, but with adults I'd rather use the precious time elsewhere. Nothing really grabs me here and says that I want to play it again. I don't see anything I want to try differently. I don't see anything particularly clever to try out. It's okay, but it just doesn't grab me.

Great game of planning and backstabbing. It's one of those games where you can completely screw people over, but still fail miserably in your own strategy. This is one of those games that are a guaranteed success.

You backstab by running other player's people into the sea, eating them with sea monsters and capsizing their boats. At the same time, you have no idea of the value of those you rescue yourself. You are able to rescue the most in numbers but sacrifice your most valuable pieces to the depths of the sea, ultimately losing you the game.

RATING: 8
This game gets an 8 on sheer fun.  The goal of the game is to move your guys from one island to another, while everyone tries everything to kill everyone else's guys with sea monsters.  There's some issues with winning the game, but that's easily settled with some house rules in the rulebook.  Play it with calm people.

This one is a lot of fun, but it can feel very random at times.  Try to sneak your high value boat past a sea monster and your entire chances of winning can hinge on a dice roll or two.  But if you don't take it too seriously, it's a lot of fun.  Especially being the one who rolls the sea monster...

Still, this is my current go-to gateway / non-gamer game (Transamerica is #2, Dixit #3 ...)

Survive's fun for all ages (mix with drinking for adults to enhance enjoyment).

This is the only game I own that, although it is not my favourite game, I would recommend for everyone's collection. Universally fun and dead-easy to teach

Have played this a couple times:  once with 2 and once with 4.  4 is much better, not surprisingly.  As advertised, it's a casual, MEAN little family game where most of the fun comes from killing your opponents' meeples with sea serpents, sharks, and whirlpools.  I like the light social negotiation stuff that emerges naturally ("If you move that sea serpent away from me, I'll pick your swimmer up in my boat next turn", etc.) and if people get into the spirit of the game, it's a blast.  Definitely light and random, but that's nice too - anyone can win.

I've only played with the variant where you don't have to use the numbers under the meeples.  Using that rule would add unnecessary cognitive load, from my standpoint - but I'll try it one day.

Very fun family game where everyone strives to get their ranked meeples to safety before the disintegrating island sinks, all the while avoiding whales, sea monsters and hungry sharks. The rules aren't too complex so even younger children can readily participate. Pick up the inexpensive giant squid and dolphin expansions for added fun.

Neat, but take caution. 

Played it solo, loved it - simple to grasp and tells a story (simple B movie like, but it's there). Played it with 4 guys in a club and though they obliterated me, we all loved it. Played it with friends and one of them whined at "evil game" and "why you kill my guys" and it was awful, downright terrible (the whiner won). 

So: if your family is fun this is a fun family game
if not: take 4 guys and a 6 pack, should work as well.

[6 plays] This is a terrific old-fashioned "take that!" style boardgame.

The initial boatloads are very important. Way too many serpents, whales, and sharks patrolling the waters in the last 2/3rds of the game.

I need more experience before I solidify my rating. What I do know about the game so far is that it is lots of fun. (But don't play it with real little kids because they will surely cry at the cruel play that comes so naturally here.)

Survive does a great job of emulating theme. You really feel like you are helping your people flee from Atlantis as it slowly sinks. People seem to dislike the slight memory aspect of this game, but I've always been a fan of memory challenges, so I welcome it. This game certainly isn't filled in nail-biting decisions. But it's fairly light, quick fun. And more often than not, that's what I'm looking for.

Holy cow - somebody trade this game with me!  I have never seen so many arguments erupt over a board game!  I even brought my daughter to tears in the the second play of the game when I was about to smash her boat with a sea serpent.  I instead declared "that's enough of this game!", packed it up, went outside, and chalked a four square court on the street.  We then laughed and played.

Have the Schimdt Spiel version: Atlantis.

Good fun. Very well made plastic bits coupled with fluid gameplay. A winner. More havoc with 4 players. The whirlpool tiles can be killer and knock people out of the game.

Playersgetto 'whack' other people, take risks, play it safe. It's the sinking of the Atlantis. What more can a gamer ask for? I have the version with the spinner. Good way to solve the 2 dice problem.

Mindig meglepnek a régi játékok. A Survive csak két évvel fiatalabb nálam, mégis nagyon jó játékról van szó. Természetesen gyerekjáték, de nagyon jól elszórakoztathatja a felnőtteket is, főleg ha egy jó kis konfrontációs játékhoz szeretnének leülni. A játékosok felfedezőikkel menekülnek a süllyedő Atlantiszról, amit sárkányok, cápák és bálnák vesznek körül. Csónakkal menekülve a cápák, úszva a bálnák nem okoznak kellemetlenséget, de a vízisárkányok bármikor felfalhatnak így is. Igazi konfrontatív játék, ahol a játékosok megpróbálják egymás felfedezőit megakadályozni a biztonságos helyekre való jutásban a süllyedő lapkákból álló Atlantisból.

Absolutely awesome fun.  I never got a chance to play Survive! when I was a kid, and that's a shame, because I'm positive I would have enjoyed it very much.  I haven't seen the old version, but the new one is FANTASTIC.  It's a gorgeous game to look at and really pleasing to the eye.  But above all, the entire family had a great time escaping to the outer islands, pleading and begging not to be eaten by sharks, and capsizing their parents boats (grumble grumble ...)  This will win Reprint of the Year, and Stronghold Games is to be commended for such great work.  I rate Survive! a 7 for now, but it's one of those games that I think will grow in rating over time, opposed to drop.  *Update* - played with the squids, and yep, the game is now an 8.

This game is great for kids! It's a simple and very visual game. It'd be helpful to have simple crib notes for everyone that list the four turn phases:

(2) Optional: Take up to three movement actions:
  (a) Move from a land space to a land space.
  (b) Move from a land space into an adjacent boat.
  (c) Move from a land space to a water space.
  (d) Move from a water space to a water space.
  (e) Enter a same-space boat from the water.
  (f) Move a boat.
  (g) Exit a boat into the same water space.
  (h) Exit a boat into an adjacent, corner land space.
  (i) Climb ashore onto one of the corner spaces.
  Note: Swimmers may only take one action.
(3) Choose one Tile to sink.
  (a) Follow the instructions on the back of the Tile.
  (b) Other players can play a defensive Tile.
(4) Roll the dice and move one sea creature.

The first thing people said before playing was "looks like we're playing a game for three-year-olds." Then they got mardy when their meeples drowned and started behaving like three year olds, which I found kind of funny and kind of sad.

It's hilarious when you crush the serious players boat with all their meeples on it, then ask them to look at the cute game artwork and explain why they're having a tantrum.

It's also fun to team up and try to make short-term diplomatic relationships with friends so both your meeples can get to shore safely...and occasionally kamikaze your one low scoring meeple into a sea monster along with two of theirs.

The greatest Parker Brothers game of all-time by a wide margin.  This game is much more about taking out your opposition than it is in trying to win, but it's delightful to have a sea serpent chop an opponent's boat with three pieces or a whale sink a critical boat.  The nostalgia factor (having owned and played this a bunch as a kid) adds to the high rating.

An awesome game, providing great fun whether its adults or kids playing.  The game sequence is pretty easy when you get the hang of it, with some really neat mechanics.  Save your people from a sinking island and the perils of the sea (who are moved by other players - inluding you)!  Very similar in some respects to 'Escape from Atlantis', but different in significant ways too.  A classic - highly recommended.

This is always a family favorite! While the components are not great, they are good enough to depict the theme of the game and draw players into the panic that comes as the game draws to a close. While it is fun to simply have the island disintegrate, the interaction with sharks, whales & sea monsters, keeps everyone involved.

This is a pretty fun little game! I generally prefer heavier, less cutthroat games, but I can't deny that it can be fun gobbling up other people's little swimmers!

--- Summary ---
Setup: randomly place tiles in the indicated area of the board. Players take turns placing their meeples (marked with VP values 1-6; mostly 1s) on unique hexes of the island; they may not look at values again till end of game
Each turn:
1. Optionally, play one previously acquired tile
2. Spend 3 movement points moving your swimmers/boats (swimmers move max 1)
3. Remove a tile from the board (beaches, then forests, then mountains) and look at the underside; some are saved till later, some are played immediately (if volcano drawn, game ends immediately)
4. Roll die and move the matching creature

Always a fun game. It's nice to be a little mean, form and later ignore alliances, gleefully move a sea monster three spaces, etc. I also made a cake version of this once, where you removed a hexagon of cake and ate it. That was also excellent.

I love older games, so I have a soft spot for Survive!  It's a fun game not to be taken too seriously.  Lasts a little long to be considered great, but it's a good one for mixiing gamers and casuals as well as adults and children.

Light game where you are trying to save you meeples by getting them off a sinking island and onto some safe islands on the corners of the board.  As tiles are removed from the island (as it sinks);, these tiles are the trigger for adding sea monsters, sharks, whales and dolphins to the board.  There are of course boats that you can use (safe from sharks) put invariably many (most) of your peeps will be trying to swim for it and you may not realize this but  sharks swim faster than meeples.  It is light and entertaining.  Nothing you want to mess with if you want a brain burner, but a good evening ender or a low-stress warm-up.

A great "screw your neighbor" game with a lot of luck. Been playing this with someone with horrible luck, and it's almost a given that he'll get only a couple of points, if any. As with any "screw your neighbor" game, I good amount of social engineering improves the game dramatically.

Now I see why everyone wants this game. It is for much more than nostalgia. Preordered the Stronghold games edition and got "The Giant Squid" mini-expansion for free!

The game came yesterday.  Minor box damage, 1 meeple and two tiles are marked.  They also should have used a color other than black for the numbers on the blue meeples.  Waiting for a reply from Stronghold re these issues.  They seem eager to please so I do not anticipate any trouble.  Will update when I know more.

Received an email to confirm my issues and with assurances that the few issues I have are being addressed.  Thank you Stronghold.

RATING: 5
What a muddle. Survive: Escape from Atlantis is the latest entry in a series which has seen half a dozen different versions with slightly different rules over 30 years (Survive, Escape from Atlantis etc.). The general principle is that players control Atlanteans trying to escape their sinking island. The waters contain various creatures which eat swimmers, destroy boats or both; they appear as the island sinks, one tile removed per turn, because each tile has an effect such as "a shark appears here". Atlanteans reaching the outer islands are worth points.

Notable variations include whether:

* Tiles are flat cardboard or overproduced plastic, which is relevant from a rules perspective as the plastic editions enforce a practical tile limit of 3 meeples.
* Atlanteans can flee to adjacent land tiles or always become swimmers.
* Boats are placed randomly or in fixed positions.
* Sea creatures have movement distance fixed, determined by die roll or by other method.
* "Dives" (basically creatures teleporting around the map) are handled by tile draw or die roll.
* Dolphins exist and how they work.
* Atlanteans have numbers on the bottom worth 1-6 points or are just worth 1 each.
* The game ends when the volcano tile is drawn, when Atlanteans escape, when the last tile is removed etc.

Which variant is best is a matter of some debate. My rating for this Stronghold edition reflects that I find Escape from Atlantis to be more elegant in its implementation (fewer types of tile). There is certainly an argument to be made that fixing sea monster movement to 1, for example, makes positioning more important because it is much harder for one to destroy a boat and eat all aboard. But tile effects are still wildly unbalanced and only conditionally useful so I can hardly credit that it is any less random.

Similarly, some argue that the hidden point values add a fun bluffing element but the game is so random that I don't think it stands up to scrutiny. I personally also prefer the end condition where all of one player's remaining Atlanteans reach an island, because it becomes possible to force an early game end by sending sharks after one's own swimmers.

I like the concept but not, in this latest version, the execution. Escape from Atlantis is a faster and more elegant game.

Would be higher rated if played better with 2P, great family game with 4 though. However, for such a simple game there are a lot of fiddly rules to remember which sometimes keeps me from introducing it to muggles. The game mechanics certainly show their age.

I would rate this a 6 with 2P and 8 with 4P.

[Parker Brothers 'Survive' 82 Edition] {Nautical, survival; modular-board, dice rolling, secret unit; optimal 4p} Survive! is very good family game with strong survival theme.  It's a pity that it's no longer in print. It is a fun and strategic game. Players have to cleverly move their pawns to get high scores. They also have to decide when to let go some pawns.  It's very funny to watch serpents/sharks/whales moving towards swimmers or boats and exciting to know what event is going to happen. It's of strong player interaction and confrontation. In all, it's an exceptional family game. Every game collector should have a copy in their collection.

This is the game that got our family on to boardgames again. Growing up when boardgames were mentioned all I knew of were Parker Brothers or Hasbro games which never appealed to me. Then one summer, while picking my son up from summer camp, he was playing this with his friends. Each time I picked him up they were playing and it intrigued me. So I looked for it and finally bought it...then all the expansions! We were hooked. Then I started looking for more like it and discovered just how great and diverse some of these games were. Now I'm only limited by how much my wife will let me buy!

Lovely game. Short, sweet, and works well with 2 and four players. (I strongly recommend either drawing two tiles a turn or playing with two sets of meeples per player with two players else all tension drops out of the game). The wooden components are a bit inconsistent, but the overall quality of the game is quite good. This is an excellent family game, as well as a great filler game to play in preparation for the main event. I'm absolutely in love with the little wooden sea creatures. And sinking your opponent's boats never gets old.

Great game that I lusted after for a long time before getting for Christmas. Since then, it's lost a little of its hype- and nostalgia-induced lustre, but overall remains a fun experience that I'll gladly pull out.

Survive's relatively simple rules work well with new/casual gamers, and once everyone embraces the 'take that' element, the majority of people that I've played with have had a good time.

I prefer the 'blue dice/dolphin' variant, with a couple of house rules.

This should be considered one of the best gateway games out there.  Simple and fun, while at the same time very "mean" and cutthroat.  Great for all ages.

I much prefer Survive to 'Escape from Atlantis' because of the hidden scoring and the lack of magic dolphins.  It's not a bad game even in this day and age, but it is a basic tactical movement with some randomness thrown in.

30th Anniversary Edition.
Rather than 'surviving', this game is better known for 'killing'. It's more enjoyable to pick on your friends and stop them from saving any of their people. Easy to set-up and play! A fun game where anything can happen as the tiles are shuffled and the rolls can change your fate. If you can't survive, then why not take others down with you?

Solid gate way game. More of a fun filler, "screw your neighbor" type game. I don't mind playing this if someone suggests it, but if given the choice I'd probably select another game.

I might lose this one brutally (not getting a single survivor to shore)  but it's actually a lot of fun to play.  It's got hidden strategy, surprises and a fun theme (I like the idea of the sinking island and how its represented by the mechanics).  I enjoy the secret scoring, the cut-throat gameplay, the absolute douchebaggery and the tile reveals.  Really looking forward to playing this one again with the giant squid expansion.

RATING: 7
It is surprising that a Parker Brothers game from the eighties can be so good.  Survive is an excellent game that has a little bit of a nasty side.  You commonly have to make a decision on who to go after with the sea monsters, and since victory points on the potential survivors are quite varied (from one to six) and hidden, you just have to go with a feel for who is in the lead.  This plays best with four, because in the four player game, you know going in that time is going to be extremely tight, and on almost everyone's turn another guy gets dunked in the sea.  A lot of meeples aren't going to make it to shore, which gives the game a nice tension and sense of forboding before you even start.  The cardboard bits are pretty thin, which detracts a little from the overall feel of the game, but it is fun.

RATING: 6.5
Fun, straight-forward game for a humorous family game night and scales very nicely down to two (just use two colors each). I really like the tiles and their dual-use as action cards (even the thickness varies among terrain types--a really cool detail). Gameplay can be a bit dull as a lot of times your choices are obvious, but the fun is much more in sabotaging your opponents than getting your own people safe. Overall, it's a very light, cutthroat game that's good at keeping everyone engaged. It requires very little thinking, so it's a particularly welcome diversion after a long day.

Survive! is a charming 1982 disaster game that is completely outflanked by modern strategy games.  I'm sure that it was considered overly complex at the time, particularly with its random hex setup.  Today, its blend of light strategy and heavy luck makes it a good game for mixed company.  I recommend the simpler rules of Stronghold's 30the Anniversary edition, which duplicates the original.  Clean and neat.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
I wanted to like this game, but it is too random for my taste. You spend a lot of time setting up the island and placing your people. In most of my games, the setup took as long as the game play. I also found there were not enough meaningful decisions. This is really a filler/gateway game. The problem with this being a gateway game is again the amount of time to set up the game. I wouldn't waste my time playing with 2 players. The sweet spot is really 4 players.

This was another surprise hit. I wanted to try it for a while because it gets generally positive ratings and has great production value, but I always thought it maybe seemed too light and random. After playing it, I have to say the light and randomness is actually a strength here. Much like Cosmic Encounter of Blood Bowl Team Manager, things that are outside of your control are just going to happen. A sea monster will unexpectedly eat a boat full of your people. One of your opponents might suddenly jump out a boat that you were in together and then swim to safety with the help of a dolphin. A lifeboat might suddenly appear next to the last person you had still trapped on the island and now they can escape. This is a light game with a good amount of randomness, but it's a lot of fun.

Loved this game as a kid.  The tile flipping was unique in it's day and there was lots of screwage to go around.  I want to make my own copy since it typically goes for $50 on ebay, but I am holding out finding a copy in a thrift store.  Each day my desire to own it grows though and I may be building it very soon.

UPDATE: So I built it, played it and it still rocks!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Great fun. It doesn't offer deep strategy--which I usually prefer--but does offer a great deal of attack opportunitites for all players. I recommend it for families who want a fun-themed, cut-throat experience.

1/8/12 -- I'm going to bump this down to a flat 7. It just doesn't have staying power. I'll keep it because I have certain members of my family who LOVE it. 

I also bought the 5-6-player mini expansion and I don't recommend that to anyone unless you absolutely need it. Adding the extra players add too much downtime between plays, add chaos to an already chaos-loaded experience. Also, it comes with terrible non-sticky stickers for the plastic meeples.

3/4/12 -- The more my family asks to play this game, the more I realize I don't like it. I'm bumping it down to a 6 flat. Again, I'll keep it because there are a couple younger members of my family who really like it. But I'll probably never bring up the idea to play it again.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pretty fun, but seems slightly overrated to me.  Still it has gotten quite a bit of play and I do enjoy it.

I find it to be slightly too long for the enjoyment I get and it seems that knowing the values of your meeples would make the game better, yet I cannot be bothered to memorize them.  I think I want to houserule that owners can look at meeple values at any time.

Update: Rating stays the same. I've never tried my proposed house rule. I still have fun.

I have now tried all of the expansions and they all bring something different to the game. I don't think any of them are bad, but none of them seems particularly good either. I guess I might say the dolphins are pretty good. The 5-6 player expansion is appreciated as I do often play with up to 6, but I think the game is a bit worse with more.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 1

RATING: 10
The Holy Grail of light games.

Considering that Survive was originally published in 1982,  it is s safe bet that this may be the number one game of those that are categorized as "way ahead of their time".

Regardless of when this was released,  be it decades ago or just yesterday,  this is a nearly flawless design that yields a level of fun unrivaled by all challengers.

I own both the original Parker Brothers edition and the Stronghold 30th Anniversary edition.  The original has a nostalgic charm,  with excellent components considering it's era - featuring, as Quint might say,  meeples that look like "they'd been bitten in half below the waist".

Stronghold upgraded the game,  which for the most part was befitting of this classic gem.  Some components,  like the wooden boats and thick tiles are obvious improvements.  Some are less so,  namely the use of the color black for the shark fin and the less than menacing look of the powder blue whales - not to mention the meeples who appear to walk on water.  Perhaps I am a bit harsh on the revamped edition - a lot of effort went into all aspects of the design - and it shows.  I suppose the fact that I hold this game in such high reverence has much to do with it.

Survive excels at the full player count of 4,  or as a 2 player game providing you use 2 colors each - which is my favorite way to play.  You need to start with a full island to visually appreciate the chaos that is sure to ensue.

All in all,  I recommend the stronghold edition over the original - if not for the sole reason that you will want to play this game repeatedly - and those components,  at the very least,  stand a better chance of survival.  You should be so lucky.......

The exclamation point in the title says it all! Perfect balance of skill, luck, offense, defence, and fun! Move your escapees to saftey, dodge whirlpools, and send sharks to eat your friends - all in one move! The game looks great, but my color-blind friend does have a bit of trouble telling the difference between the purple, orange, and red tokens. Regardless, this is an excellent find, works well will 2-4 players (with 2, we each play two different colors, so instead of 10 escapees each, we play with 20), and the random setup really adds to the replay value. Get this game!

About [thing=2653][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=2653][/thing], like the description says, is a cutthroat game where players seek to evacuate their pieces from a island that is breaking up and sinking, while remembering where their highest-valued pieces are located to maximize their score. This it is. And it is also a game of revenge, persecution, some teamwork, backstabs and drowning, a good deal of drowning. Because most meeples will die. Boats will be destroyed, sharks will eat and sea serpents will crush and kill. Whatever the atlanteans did, it was probably really horrible, as the beasts can even teleport themselves in order to massacre more.

[thing=2653][/thing] is a fight to survive against nature, only in this case nature have human cunning on its side. 

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
In her turn the player have 3 movement points. She can move the same meeple, on land, one, two or three hexes. Or one, two hexes, and other, one hex. Whatever. If the meeple in swimming, it can only be move 1 hex - but multiple (up to three) meeples in the water can be moved 1 hex (or use 1 movement to climb into a boat). A boat can also me moved, but only if is empty or by the player(s) with the most meeples on it. If a meeple, swimming or using boat, reaches a beach, it is safe.

After its three movements, the player takes for herself one of the land tiles - first it must be a beach tile, once all of these were taken, then the forest tiles and, finally, the mountain tiles. Each tile has an action associated with it: the ones with green borders are used immediately, and usually serve to add things to the board (like sharks, whales, boats and sinking holes); the ones with red borders, that have varied uses, the player keeps and can be used in later turns.

Finally the player rolls the monster die, to know which monster she will be able to move. There are three types: whales, that move 0 to 3 spaces, and can destroy boats; sharks, that move 0 to 2 spaces, and can kill meeples on the water (but doesn't affect those on boats); and the sea serpents, that can only move 1 space, but do both things: destroy boats and kill people on the water (and can do both together, when destroying a boat with meeples). After moving one creature of the kind rolled on the die, the turn passes to the next player.

Play goes like this until the volcano tile (which is bellow one of the mountain tiles) is revealed. The game ends immediately and the winner will be the player that scores the highest among the point value of the meeples saved.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Where to move. With whom divide a boat with. Which sea animal to move. Which tile to take and, if is a red one, when to use it later. Good positioning and some teamwork can help a player a lot, as you can work together so save meeples, but you might have you 6 (highest value) on the boat, while your opponent has her 1 (lowest), so, while you both achieve the same goal: saving your meeple, you took greater advantage - and you can still use this as a bargain chip later "we worked so well to save these, we can do it again" or "I helped you here, don't kill my meeple!".

You can even use your value 1 meeples to cause havoc, entering with them on the first boats leaving the island (usually filled with the highest value meeple of others), only to be able to steer them to destruction. Don't expect much friendship later, though - but, there isn't much left anyway.

[thing=2653][/thing] is mostly tatical in nature, and players are required to do the best possible with what is given and what is going on. There are a lot of luck involved in the game, so there is little reason to overthink actions and options. Decide just what is safer and/or more fun.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Light and easy to teach;
- Lots of interaction between players;
- Good production value - the pieces are well done, the tiles are thick and the board is pretty;
- While there is high level of luck in the draw of tiles and in the die, most of the game is driven by players decisions, not random.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- A metric ton of take that - and is not even "guided". Normally, if a player has a chance to not screw anyone or to screw a player losing badly, the second option will most likely be taken 80% of the time. This happens because of the secrecy of the value of the meeples and works in two ways: I could have saved only two, but with them being my 5 and 6, while you saved 5, a 1, 1, 2, 3 and 4. We both have 11 points, but who do you think will take more heat? On the other hand, I could have saved my 1 and 3, but someone could think I did saved my 5 and 6, so I couldn't really count on mercy;
- Huge difference of usefulness of tiles: I can reveal a Boat tile that don't even help me at all, or a Swirl that can kill my meeples, while you can take a superb "Teleport the Sea Serpent to Anywhere", which is totally amazing and carries no drawback. By blind luck, one can do win (or lose) the game with the tiles taken;
- Due to the way the game works, someone could lose early all of her meeples and has no chance of winning, just staying on the game causing havoc.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
[thing=2653][/thing] reminds me of a chocolate cigarette: a relic of a past time, in which family oriented games where filled with things today we consider almost crazy. Today chocolate should have low sugar and no trans fat (I can't say for a fact, but I do believe these two items counted for the composition of 85% of the chocolates I ate in my younger years), and most definitely must not have a cigarette shape. For games, this means: family games now should have low harmful interaction, normally without killing and being eaten by sharks after being throwed in the water by Dad. This is the stuff psychologists thrive on.

While keeping itself simple and easy enough to understand and play, the game is filled with opportunities for everyone being mad at each other. It is all for fun, though. One can't really take anything in [thing=2653][/thing] seriously. It isn't a thinky game, nor it poses as one. Players have control over their movements, but so much can happen between your plays that you can only hope that something is on place when you are up again.

Of course, when playing with the kids, is possible to hold back and put mom and dad as targets and going around chasing air with the sea beasts. But best of luck trying to hold back an older sibling - still, the same could be said to the brawls started with my brother and friends due to Super Street Fighter II.

[thing=2653][/thing] relies on players to keep being mean and unforgiven - and the designers, being humans, knew it would work. Though the degree can vary.

Fun light fare. Simple concepts and few rules, make it approachable for non-gamers and kids. But can be complex enough to keep it interesting for everyone. Fair amount of luck, in the tile distribution, also keeps the game competnitive regardless of skill levels. Certainly the hefty cut-throat aspects work to keep things moving along and suspensful.

Great little game!  Uses tiles as cards (remove a tile, do what the back says) and the sharing of boats makes this a cooperative game as well as competitive- at different times.  Suprisingly sophisticated design for a 1982 Parker Bros game.

Survive is a cutthroat game where players seek to evacuate their pieces from an island that is breaking up, while remembering where their highest-valued pieces are located to maximize their score.
An island made up of 40 hex-tiles is slowly sinking into the ocean (as the tiles are removed from the board). Each player controls ten people (valued from 1 to 6) that they try and move towards the safety of the surrounding islands before the main island finally blows up. Players can either swim or use boats to travel but must avoid sea serpents, whales and sharks on their way to safety.

Why didn't I have this game as a kid? It's fun and challenging. The play can run a bit slow because the people I play with don't always want to be cutthroat when maneuvering sea creatures but even that choice makes the game dynamic and allows players to tailor the game to their own style.
We have the newer version and the art style is lovely. I especially like the creature pieces. The weight and style add to the play of the game.

This is currently my favorite game.  I received this as a gift from my parents, who will play games but it isn't their hobby.  This game had them in stitches, laughing at the munching up of meeples, the plight of my little yellow guys who seemed to attract all of the sea monsters.  First and most importantly this game is FUN!  Secondly it is easy to explain and play.  There is some planning and strategy, but also a fair amount of randomness which levels the playing field and provides unpredictability.  Fun game, and I love it because it had my mom laughing.

Played the original 1982 Parker edition once and I feel it is a nice family game. The first few rounds are agreeable, and then (as the island becomes smaller and more sharks and whales appear) you start feeling the turn angst! In the end, it is the randomness that stops the game from getting a higher rating: Especially the island hexes depicting shark fins seem a bit unfair. I also played the Hasbro edition, but for that one please deduct at least two points from this score.

Quite a bit chaotic, but then again, this was to be expected. The game play was also a bit slower than I actually enjoyed. Pros: lots of laughs and backstabbing in the game. There is nothing quite like eating your opponents survivors just as they climb up the shore. Lots of fun. The board is also nicely constructed and the various bits are well produced. Certainly coming close to what I call a party game. Cons: A bit too long for 4 players. Can be a brutal game where one player gets engulfed with bad luck. May not be suitable for non-conflict oriented players since players can gang up and take on a single person.

RATING: 9
My 3 boys love playing this game- especially when they get to eat their brother's meeples.  Very nice components, thought I think there are probably too many.  This game has an interesting mechanism using the island tiles as your 'draws' for your turn.  However the game becomes a bit clunky- you move you meeples, draw a island tile, do the action from the tile, roll a dice, find the creature on the dice and move them a certain number of spaces.  That's a bit too much for each turn.  Still an enjoyable game to play.

I had a copy of this during the 80's and it was one of my favorites at the time. The sinking island tile mechanic seemed pretty novel at the time and the use of action points to make your moves (and that of the sharks, whales, and sea monster when they come up on the special die) work well. Ahead of its time for a mass-market game from the 80s and the theme is extremely well integrated. Plus it plays quickly. I highly recommend playing a game if opportunity presents itself. A classic!

This game is fun and thematic.  After hearing about how great the components were I was somewhat disappointed with the quality of the pieces.  The meeples were all different shapes and the other pieces looked like they had been cut with a dull bit.  When it's all said and done, though, the quality of the bits did not affect game play despite their lack of polish or consistency.  There is so much happening on the board that I doubt I'll remember which meeple is which or notice the slight defects.  I enjoyed some of the take that moments and the tension that develops during the game as more and more pieces come out to the board.  My wife and I both had fun and look forward to playing again soon.

Now that I've had a few plays of this game, I'm feeling pretty underwhelmed and a little let down.  I knew the game had pretty simple mechanics, which is fine.  I wanted an easy to play game where you could mess with other players, and I loved the theme of escaping a sinking Island.  Also love all of the pieces.

In play though, I always feel a little bored.  The people I play with always say they enjoy it, maybe I'm just expecting more.  Turns just felt kind of uneventful and too samey.  Feels like you get your first 3-6 Adventurers to safety with no hassle and then the second half it's near impossible to swim across.

I like it, I'll probably keep it around as a game to play with non-gamers or younger kids, just not in a rush to play it.

Rescue your guys from the sinking island, and have them swim or take boats to safety. Numerous creatures like sharks and sea serpents are waiting to eat them, so not many will make it through the gauntlet.

Take your adventurers from a sinking island using boats or just dive and swim to the nearest land. But be carefull!! There are dangers in the sea.Hungry creatures live in the depths of the ocean.
Light family competitive game which involves some strategy, but it's more fun when you don't think too much.
There is a lot of interaction between the players and usually you will want to "revenge" someone. This is happen very often and that was part of the fun. Mechanics and theme bound nicely together resulting in a very pleasant gaming experience.

Chaotically fun game. I don't know if it holds up to today's standards for board games though. The game is incredibly luck driven with the tile draws and the dice rolling and it's core mechanics are as mean as they come. The theme is good and prevelant. Components are above average as is the art. The rules are easy to learn. An aging game that maybe passed by eventually.

This was the game that showed me the benefits of mean-spirited play.  It's not that you want to hurt the people you're playing against, but sometimes it's just in your best interest to hit them once or twice to gain an advantage.  I wouldn't recommend doing this to someone in real life, but in games, it's perfectly legitimate.  Survive! has some randomness through the tile draw and the die rolls, but hey, it wouldn't be much of a game without them!  Interestingly enough, this is one of those games that thrives off of the chaos, so it doesn't seem to click as well with just 2 players.  It's a little too easy for both players to do their own thing at that point, and it's far too easy to make plans that can carry from turn to turn.  I would mark this game as strictly a 4-player affair.

One of the better mass-marketed games from most gamers' childhoods gets a well-deserved and well-made reprint.  The gameplay is identical to the original, and Stronghold made the right decision to include both versions of the game in the reprint.  It speaks a lot toward their commitment to making good games, and accommodating gamers from both sides of the pond.

SURVIVE!: Well, it's the same game, so I may as well copy my comments directly from there: This was the game that showed me the benefits of mean-spirited play.  It's not that you want to hurt the people you're playing against, but sometimes it's just in your best interest to hit them once or twice to gain an advantage.  I wouldn't recommend doing this to someone in real life, but in games, it's perfectly legitimate.

RATING: N/A
Survive is a cutthroat game where players seek to evacuate their pieces from an island that is breaking up, while remembering where their highest-valued pieces are located to maximize their score.
\13\\13\
An island made up of 40 hex-tiles is slowly sinking into the ocean (as the tiles are removed from the board). Each player controls ten people (valued from 1 to 6) that they try and move towards the safety of the surrounding islands before the main island finally blows up. Players can either swim or use boats to travel but must avoid sea serpents, whales and sharks on their way to safety.

Its a great game. I really like its board and its materials. I think the production its really smart. Every time that I play it I enjoy it. The board its different every time we play it, so you can have lot of hours of fun. But I don´t like that sometimes people waste a lot of time thinking on their play  and  the game takes more than 45 minutes.  I think that the main reason of it, it is because you have to do so many actions in each turn and people do not get properly the game mechanics.... In spite of it, I think it depends on the people  you are playing with.... If they are used to play board games or not.

RATING: 6
I remember owning this as a kid and I played the hell out of it, often times solitaire. At some point, like most kids, I stopped playing because of some other new toy or distraction and Survive! was mostly forgotten.

Here we are a couple of decades later. My good friend Zxqueb is telling me about some old boardgame from his childhood he rediscovered while he was cleaning out his parent's attic. Survive!

The next games day, Zxqueb brought it over and it hit the table immediately. Amazingly enough, it was still as good as I remembered it as a kid. It was exciting to flip a tile and watch the island slowly disintegrate. It was fun to jump my guys into someone else's boat and take control from them. It was awesome to dump my opponents villagers into the drink...and the mouth of an awaiting shark. Even as I type this I am a little bit amazed that the game has held up so well. It has a remarkably modern feel for a game that is almost 30 years old. I really wish I had my old copy back...

UPDATE: Reprint....Woot!

I first played this game at DTC and thought it was really quite fun.  I have not had many plays but I do really enjoy it.  I have played a game where one player kind of got shut out...if that is common in a game, it is not one I would typically want to play.  But I am hoping that was a rarity and at the moment I still really enjoy this game and have success introducing it to new gamers.

Survive is an excellent family game and yet it also has enough depth to be fun for a group of gamers as well.  Survive can be a pretty brutal and cut-throat experience (and that fierce competition is most of the fun) but as long as the players know that, it makes for a delightful time.

It's rules are very simple and easy to teach and the game only takes about 60 minutes, which makes it great for gatherings around the dinner table.

Highly recommended.

This is Adrienne's favorite game. The objective of the game is to save as many of your colored meeples from the sinking island of Atlantis. Each player gets three movements, then the flip over a tile, and finally they get the chance to move a monster based on a die roll. Some of the tiles will put sharks or whales into the game which can eat swimmers or sink boats respectively. There are also sea monsters which can destroy anything it the same space as it. This is very much a "take that" type of game, and the more players the more meeple violence. It is very easy to learn and fairly quick to play, and in general a good game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I am surprisingly good at this game, which makes it all the more fun. I am good at remembering where my "maximum valued" pieces are and I seem to be good at whatever strategy this game entails, but I don't always like the fact that my pieces die (it can be aggravating when you're so close and then bang, shark attack!) and I don't always (read: never) remember what the shark, whales, and sea serpents do. In this case, I am surprisingly happy with trying to sabotage other players and can do so while keeping track of my own pieces, which is rare. I do get a sense of satisfaction when my pieces survive. Good theme, great execution, lots of fun.
PS. I also like the whole "who controls the boat" aspect and how tiles you flip can get you surprise bonuses or abilities. I enjoy that element of randomness. I don't like how evacuating a boat counts as a move and I always forget that part, d'oh! I don't like how random the end condition is. >

This game is a classic. It proves this time and time again by being very new-gamer friendly. I love taking this game off the shelf in it's large square box and letting the box art and concept entice players. It also has an interesting competitive dynamic and memory friendly game play. 

I really like this game, but over time it becomes a repeat of the same mechanics same experiences and encounters. 

Update 10/4/2017:

When the average man thinks of board games they may recall sitting in doors on a rainy afternoon playing with their siblings. At some point some sibling does something reasonably diabolical in the game and another sibling gets annoyed or upset. Survive could very well be that game. When played as an adult it is a fun and nail-biting experience as everyone fends for themselves to survive a sinking island. This is a perfect gateway game and extremely easy to teach.

Fun, fast and with enough strategy to make me happy.  Love the pieces--whales, sharks, sea serpents, dolphins, and the island sections.  

One of the reasons I enjoy gaming as much as I do is because of the tactile experience.  Touching, flipping, holding and tapping pieces as I contemplate my next move has always been enjoyable to me.

Survive: Escape from Atlantis has that element more than most games.  

Quick play, loaded with giggles, pleasant to look at.  Fine family game.  If you are attempting to lure your family into gaming, try Survive.  :)

I'm sure they'll look back at this game with some fondness as they get older so it'd be stupid to flick it off.

Not a bad game. I like the idea of it, I just wish it had a little more meat to it. As it stands, it's a bit too much on the light side.

We played a 2-player variant to use two colors each, and randomly placed meeples in the beginning. I understand knowing which one is worth more is a part of the core concept, but that much tracking isn't my thing.

Probably better with more people and the right (young) crowd.

Fun concept, and often some hilarious moments... but the rules are often a bit fiddly for the amount of strategy they add. I was also a bit disappointed in how straightforwardly the game plays out; things progress too fast for you to detour or change plans, so there's lots of carnage, but not much frantic swimming/rowing back and forth; either you make it to safety or you don't, pretty much.

(TRADE Interest: low) may be a "kid's" game, but it sure did entertain us adults.  i found that there was plenty of tension in the turns, and lots of possible strategy, and a bit of memory.  the randomness of the tile draws maybe was a little big, but it still has some neat mechanics (the island disappearing), and good game play.  one point must be made, and that is, it seems that often the person who is lucky and draws the good tiles (move boat, move swimmer) or more tiles, will be the winner.

7 after 1 play.

Light game with some humour. Only part I dislike is the numbering under each person. Remembering the number forces one to play the game more seriously, but isn't this a light game?

We all love this game. It's a great "get even" game to play in the middle or end of a session where people can get you back pretty savagely for winning at other games! I think this is probably one of the favourites in my group and I can't see myself ever getting rid of it.

+ 5/6 player expansion, Octopus

Nagyon vicces játék! Ezt tényleg nem lehet komolyan venni!
Ez a játék tényleg a játék öröméről szól. Teljesen mindegy hogy ki nyerte meg a játékot, az élmény felejthetetlen.
Ennyi nevetéssel még egy játék se tudott megajándékozni!
Tökéletes családi kikapcsolódás!

AFP: Giant Squid is stupid and I won't with it ever again.
I doubt if two dices are also such a good idea - they're more random than the single red die.

I'll give it another try but this time with basic rules and no challenge rules (but I would miss the dolphins ;) )

ASP: without stupid Giant Squid and with basic rules the gameplay runs smoothly. It was fun with three.

Classic game over 30 years old! Stronghold wouldn't have reprinted it if it wasn't good. It's a great filler and good game for non-gamers. The more I play it the more I appreciate this game.

RATING: 7
This feels a bit like faster, randomer Pompeii.  If the special movement tiles end up distributed fairly evenly it might even be more fun... but if one person gets a bunch more good tiles than the others they should win this in fairly lopsided fasion.

If you like having your friends over just so you can eat their tribesmen with sea monsters and sharks, this is the game for you. Warning: Sea monsters are scary. I also recommend the expansions for this game, as they add a little bit extra. 

Also: Dolphins are awesome.

Love the concept of moving men on boats in this one. It's a bit cutthroat for some, but every group I play this with is engaged and having a great time. One of my favorites!

A great game to add to any collection. It plays in about an hour. Even though it is a competitive game, it plays good as a family game too. The rules are easy to learn after the first play through. I would suggect playing with the Blue Dice/Dolphins, it adds a little more element to the game.

After playing a few sessions, this light beer & pretzels game turned out to be more enjoyable than originally expected.  Even though a player's choices are relatively simple, they could drastically affect victory conditions.  The randomness of the tiles certainly contributes to the unpredictability of the game and its replayability factors whilst helping to balance the varying experience levels of the players.

The components are extremely nice, well made and durable.  The board is especially beautiful and all the components reflect the theme quite nicely.  One would certainly feel he/she received his/her money's worth.

Picked up what must have been one of the last remaining copies of the previous release (not the 30th anniversary). Good balance between simple rules, light strategic thinking and take that-elements. Top notch rule book!

This is a pretty good family-eats-family game; however, all the gobbling each other up isn't really my cup of tea.  I recall enjoying it a bit more in my youth, although finding it more fascinating than specifically good.

RATING: 7.5
Pretty darn fun after 1.5 plays (we discovered we were making a mistake with a rule halfway through the first play and re-started.)  The ultimate in quick and easy cut throat gaming.  Very recommended if you're looking for a light filler that will elicit groans of pain from your fellow players as you repeatedly screw them over.

Based on one play with 3, I think 3 or 4 players is fine.  I would avoid if seeking a 2 player game.  I don't think it would work well with 2.

Loads of fun but I'd prefer to play Black Fleet since Black Fleet simply has more interaction with all the players and the ability to truly be an ass, which is always fun.

For a lighter game, Survive is stellar. It is probably my favourite game that I could play with my parents. The rules are simple and easy to pick up, but there is enough depth of play to keep more strategy-oriented players interested.

A strength of this game is that play can be varied to different levels of competition. Both friendly and cutthroat games are possible, and I enjoy both experiences. A must-have for a family looking for boardgames.

It's very random indeed, and as a 2-player experience is very dull. Yet with 4-players it's one of the best I've played in the backstabbing, cut-throat, style of games.

It looks easy enough to escape, but getting your players to safety is often like feeding fish-flakes to goldfish.

Upgraded to the 30th Anniversary Edition. It features better artwork throughout, and plastic seaples as standard.

I do not miss the dolphins or dive dice at all, and on the odd occasion we did use them the other players weren't too keen on them either.

The one tiny let down is the 'red creature die' which should have been an engraved one rather than a crappy printed one.

The most destructive and non-paedagogic kid's game :) Great fun to drown your opponents men or eat their boats with the seamonsters. Never saw such a game - if you're out of the game you can still try to create as much mayhem as possible :)

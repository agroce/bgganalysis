The game is pretty easy to learn but, nonetheless, sufficiently deep in strategy and tactics to make it one of my favorite "45 minutes games".
I'm up to play it anytime. It's a little trasure: simple and intelligent.

A really good filler game.  It's something of a math exercise.  I can see how this could create Analysis Paralysis if placed in the hands of the wrong people, but if not, it's a quick trip through resource management and on-the-fly decision making.  The rating will probably go down with more plays, because there are not a lot of directions to go (the strategy is straight-forward), but for the first two times playing it, it was a fun one.

RATING: 7
A tile-layer where the luck of the draw is minimised by giving each player an identical and partially ordered stack. Players decide how many tiles to lay (1-3) and can distribute up to five control markers - sorry, robber knights - in a row from each castle tile laid.  The hitch is that your knights can be overlaid and whoever's knight is on top at the end scores for the tile.  The game presents interesting decisions on placement, pacing, and risk taking in placing knights.  A conservative strategy of placing knights up to a tile's limit can be beaten by one that risks some losses for greater gains.  Having tiles and knights to place at the end, while opponents have run out of either or both, is potentially game winning.  

Raub Ritter fell a bit flat for me with just two players.  I think it needs the greater chaos and interaction brought by more players to keep it fun. 

As others have commented, the artwork is a bit uninspired, but the components are all serviceable.

Played it once with three - and we all introduced too many knights early in the game.  This is a game is tactical and obviously fairly abstract but I like it quite a bit.

Played it some more and my opinion hasn't changed.  I have yet to play with two though.

RATING: 5
{1 play, 4 players} Didn't really care for it, but am willing to try again, just to make sure.  Most of our moves involved dropping 1 on the first tile, then the rest of the stack on the 2nd valuable tile.  Well, assuming you drew the right tile to start that play... or got set up by the player on your right.  Ugh.  Plus, it's very dry, which I don't care for in games.  I think I'd rate this a point lower if it weren't Dorn... but I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt - maybe further play will reveal something.  Of course, there may not be further play, as the others in the group were unimpressed, as well.

RATING: 6.5
Small box games can often contain some real gems that play deeper than the box size indicates.  This game, however, plays per its box size.  That is not a bad thing, it just means that you should expect a lighter game.  This game is basically an area control game with a simple ability to capture spaces previously occupied.  This makes the order of your plays important.  The variable board ensures each game plays out slightly different.  Game length is very quick, especially with 2 players.  The game seems to be slightly better as a 2 player versus multi-player.  A good selection for a warm-up or while waiting for another game to start.

Played one four player game of this. Seemed quite decent although most of us were a bit non-plussed about how to deveop a strategy. The small hand size seemed to really limit your options for developing a grand march. However, once the edges of the board were defined we got into protecting our conquests and it played fairly well, if somewhat slowly. To be fair we were all newbies at this game. A plus for this one is the mechanics - it constantly surprises me how many new mechanics game designers come up with.

Raub Ritter always leaves me with a somewhat odd feeling, as if it tries to do more than it is capable of. Or, perhaps more accurately, that it [i]is[/i] capable of more but is now stuck to this relatively simple 'interface'. 

What is immediately obvious is that the game is tremendous value for money. You get a truckload of Carcassonne-like tiles; in fact, even more than in that game. Then add 120 wooden discs; that's more wood than the meeples. The only gripe I have with the tiles is that the artwork is a bit bland and sometimes difficult to recognise. On to the game, then: with 2 players I like it considerably. It is short and tactical, but the game forces you to consider the long-term effects of your actions as well. With 4 players, I'm not so sure yet. I played a few games which were exceedingly close right until the final tiles were placed: some people got lucky and managed to collect 6 to 8 points each because they drew a castle and could place their final knights uncontested. This is a rather brutal end which does not seem to square well with the rest of the game. This cannot be easily fixed, and that is a bit of a shame.

Easy to learn, easy to play, not so easy to win :) 

Robber Knights is a majority-game, each player can add tiles to the existing tiles and every time you place a castle, the robber Knights (you can choose 1-5) come and occupy the neighbouring tiles. You can simply put your knight on any Knights that are already on the tile, but when there are 4, then you can't add any more.

For every forest you need two Knights and for mountains even 3 knights. In the end, when the tiles are placed and all the Knights have been used, you count the tiles where you have the majority. A castle counts for 1, a village for 2 and a city for 3 points and the player with the most points wins.

That's all there is to it! I've played one game with my son (7) and he liked the game and so did I. The first game was an easy win for me, but i'm sure that he'll be able to make it more difficult in next games.

I rate this gate 6.5 for now.

RATING: 6
Players are empire building on a 10x10 tile board (4 players).  On your turn, players flip and play up to three terrain tiles, in Carcassonne board building style.  If a castle is placed, up to five wooden knight discs can be played, then hopped across the board in a straight line, leaving a trail behind them.  There are certain restrictions as to the minimum number of knights that have to remain when you leave a tile, and no more than 4 knights can occupy any space.  It's all about being the knight on top of the castles, villages and towns at the end of the game, as these score the victory points.  Solid, tactical game that works well.  I don't think we've played it correctly yet, but I can see the potential.

This is yet another successful installment of the essential Rudiger Dorn "chain movement" mechanism that was made famous in Genoa, Goa and Louis XIV. Here we find the mechanic being applied to the placement of knights among various tiled terrain. All are vying for area control of the common lands. This is a very quick and enjoyable game that has very little luck even though it is a tile laying game.

Played 1 time with 4 players. This game was really disappointing. It reminded me of Reiner Knizia's Kingdoms (Auf Heller und Pfenning), both in theme and gameplay, but I'd much MUCH rather play Kingdoms. The tile laying could be clever if there were more obstacle tiles (ie. mountain tiles and lake tiles) but as is, our game too often degenerated into leaving one marker at the castle and moving the rest of our markers to the valuable twon squares. Talk about inelegant! =) Now, you might say, 'Ah, but if you play longer, you'd see that playing that way leaves you short of tokens; you really ought to let others do that and win the game.' Wel, I can see how that would be, but mostly I used the 'one move and done' strategy and I won. And honestly, the game is just not interesting enough to have me come back and try and play it better. Dull.

Players lay tiles to build the landscape and send out knights to occupy territories. The dilemma is that you don't have enough knights to conquer everything and only a limited number of castles which are required to actually place them on the board. Therefore you need to spend your forces wisely in order to both maximise points scored from occupied territory and make sure that that territory can't be taken away from you (cheaply). Simple rules, plays quickly, but a bit too much of an abstract to make a great gateway game.

RATING: 6.5
Merciless tile placement game, with a good "conquest" system -that reminds me in a way the merchant tower in Traders of Genoa.

The choices are quite limited, and the game can be frustrating: you only have 2 tiles in your hand, and since an opponent can almost always rob a conquered position, it's very often a feeling of chosing the lesser evil.

Plays fast.

RATING: 6.5
Nice small and fast game that's not as easy as it may look at first. You really have to knmow what you are doing unless you want to lose your influence and the game.

This is nothing new or great, but definitely a cool game. I wouldn't have bought it for more than the 5€ I payed, but for that price I will keep it.

RATING: 8
The people who have mentioned that your first moves are always wasted have probably only played the game a time or two.  This is a common beginner mistake but can be avoided by playing tiles into "safe havens".  I've upped my rating to 8 for this game.  It plays wonderfully with 2 and loses little with 3 or 4 (although a beginner can pass a good move along to the next player).  The way that your draw stack is built greatly minimizes the luck in the game as long as you know what's in each tile group.  For this reason, it's important to make up a tile manifest if you want to play intelligently.

This is a very strange little game. It's an area control game of sorts, except that you can decided yourself where the valuable territory will be, and you can guarantee yourself the ones that you play.  This sounds kind of interesting, but in practice it means that you NEED to guarantee that you control the ones you put down, so that's what successful players do.  Does not reward creative play.

First played April 9th, 2009. Taught in 10min, played in about 45 min with 4 players. Good mix of luck and strategy. Each player gets about 15 tiles. You start with 4 and decide which two to keep. All of the other unkept tiles are shuffled and make the starting grid. Grid can be no wider than 10x10, so once a 10th tile has been placed orthangonally, no more can be placed in that dirrection. Tiles are grassland(0 pts,1 at least x pawns), mountain(0,3), lake(0,0), castle(1,1), town(1,2), and abbly(1,3). Some tiles are in forrest and require at least two knights to be placed there. No tile can have more than 4 pawns. No one can enter the lake tile. The player with the top most pawn, gets the points at the end of the game. Game ends when all players place all of their tiles. On your turn, you must place a tile. If you place a castle, you can place up to 5 armies. Then you can take a number of armies leaving one behind on each tile and moving the rest forward. Note min and max armies above. Next you draw a tile and may repeat for a 2nd and 3rd placement, however you turn is over after the 3rd placement. You may aslo pass. After all tiles have been placed, the high score wins.

Raub Ritter is of moderate length and based on a set of simple concepts. However, the game play is more complex than is initially apparent. It is essentially a game of tactics, although the structured distribution of each player's tiles and the restricted number of knights introduce an element of strategy. After playing the game with 2, 3 and 4 players, I've found Raub Ritter to be considerably more interesting as a 3- or 4-player than as a 2-player game. Still, It would seem that the game needs to be played several times in order to judge it fairly.

What a disappointment from Rudiger Dorn...
  This is very very abstract game (basically a logic one) with a thin theme pasted on.  My only play was rather boring.  Maybe if it wasn't disguised as a game with the theme...
Still, I don't rule out that my rating might go up with future plays.

Tile-laying:Area influence:

This was quite good and better and tougher than it first looks for sure even if it is virtually themeless (no different than most Euros). Slightly prone to AP in a Tikal kinda way as choices can be tough bogging it down a bit with 4 but still very playable in 90 minutes or so, I think 3 would be a great number for this. The choice of laying 1, 2 or 3 tiles was good while keeping 2 in your hand worked well. The choice of laying up to 5 knights at once was good also. Scoring at the end was OK, I think a half-way scoring would add more tension and I will include it if I play again. Much better than original Carc, a little strategy but mostly tactical.

Update: This fell pretty flat with only 2 players, will only play 3 or 4 now

Update: 7 => 5 Played with 4 players again many years later, was mostly boring overall and a little long for what it was, not enough decisions to make and the ones you do are mostly obvious. Probably decent for 3 players but havent tried it, will still have the same main issue though.

RATING: 6
During my first play, I had no idea what I was doing. As such, the player after me was able to take advantage of my less-than-ideal moves so this game may suffer from the "bad player to your right" syndrome. Really though, what game doesn't suffer from this.

In general I felt the game was over too quickly, which is praise indeed. That said, I didn't want to start another game right away as the start game is very chaotic.

Regardless, I purchased the game. The first game with me and my S/O did not go over very well. Where I liked the feeling of helplessness during my first play (randomly trying things to see what would happen), she thought it was dumb. I doubt it will get any more plays at my house.

Although I think it is a good game, it is too abstract for most and the strategies are fairly illusive. This makes it difficult to introduce to new players. 

Traded.

This games seems to offer more choices than you have. You -can- place more than 1 tile (up to 3) each turn, but if you do, the other players can place their last tiles uncontested while you just watch them score. Whoever places his knights first will likely be overbuild, so it is prudent to delay placing knights until you must place them. Whoever is forced to place his  knights first will lose. Didn't like it at all.

Cool design that I imagine would scale well from 2-4 has players placing tiles and then deciding whether or not to place their knights (using the stack mechanism which always has you leaving at least one piece behind you).  The different terrains determine how many knights must stay to defend the land.  There's actually quite a few decisions to make both defensive and offensive.

I'm downgrading this one because it seems to have turned into little more than a memory test now. The need to keep an eye on your opponent(s) tends to negate any long-term strategy and the kindest thing to say about the theme is that it's a little bit artificial. Even the scoring doesn't quite add up: the risk involved in gaining villages makes them comparatively worthless.

Like many Rudiger Dorn games, Robber Knights involves assembling a 2-dimensional grid, and leaving a "trail" of your pieces to claim the various spaces.  This one, however, has a pretty high random factor--you may not draw the tiles you want when you need them.  There is also very little turn-to-turn strategy; it's practically impossible to set yourself up for future turns.  This might be a good alternative to a light game like Carcassonne, but I wouldn't bother if you're looking for depth.

Nice tactical game which plays well with two to four players alike. The game it self is simple and therefore very good to introduce non-gamers to the wonderful hobby of playing games. Recommended and with an added bonus that game is cheap in purchase, at least in Europe .

RATING: 5.5
Feels similar to playing something like Othello, but with more interesting options & scoring. Plays about the right length for what it is. Artwork could perhaps be improved to make it easier to tell the different structures apart, especially because the wooden pieces obstruct your view of them once placed on top.

I don't understand why this game is so underrated?  
The components are good.  
The rules are simple.  
There is plenty of strategy.  
It plays quickly.  
Lots of "screw your opponents" going on.
It's compact - can easily be a travel game.
It's cheap.

There is obviously a luck element to it, but it by no means ruins the experience.

Don't let the low ratings put you off!

A tile laying/area placement game. Something like Othello meets Carcassone.
Primarily a tactical game, with a strategy of delaying placing markers until later in the game when you "protect" your scoring cities. The game appears to be more strategic with fewer players.

Each turn gives up to 3 tiles and up to 5 makers for each castle played (which are spread in a direction like bread crumbs). At the end the player with the topmost marker on a tile scores.

Another well-presented small-box game.  Have only played 2 player so far but it works very well as such.  Try to get your knights to control the point-scoring tiles at game-end, but beware using too many knights too early on as you may be unable to stop your opponents from mopping up valuable points near the end!

This seems like an advanced version of Kingdoms.  Not Dorn's most elegant game, but surprisingly decent for what it is.  I'd like to play it a few more times to get a better sense whether or not there is much strategic depth involved.

RATING: 8
If you, like me, searched in vain for tactics (or even moderate brains) in the much-hyped Carcassonne, then this is the game for you. Robber Knights/Raub Ritter is a tactical tile-placement game that actually offers possibilities for either aggressive or defensive play. It's simply WAY better than Carcassonne, with which it will certainly be compared. Simple to learn and a joy to play -- another winner by Rüdiger Dorn. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
You'll know from the descriptions and reviews if this is a game that you will enjoy, as it does not pretend to be anything it is not.  I like it a lot: it is a simple abstract game with a nice blend of luck and tactics and some opportunity for direct conflict.  The game is like a stripped down racing car: it's down to the bare essentials, which makes for a fast, focussed game, where there is a lot of looseness in the player actions: you can choose your number of actions, the number of knights to commit and tile placement is about as free as it gets. The early game is the least interesting as most of the claims will be taken over again later.  Once the frame for the board is set, then the opportunities for clever plays abound.  The shortage of knights leads to some interesting decisions, and there is definitely the chance to pull off some satisfyingly tricky plays. The game feels to me like Through the Desert with more direct confrontation.  It is more tactical than Through the Desert and allows cleverer actions, but lacks the strategic dimension that the initial placements in Through the Desert sets up. A spatial game with a small element of inter-player psychology. Rate it an 8 with fast players.

[Excellent condition. Played once. Complete.]

Abstract strategy game with tile laying and token ("robber knight") deployment in rows and columns where the player whose token is highest up will score. Ability to play conservatively or aggressively (with risk), and players must account for landscape limitations on each tile as well.

RATING: 5
This game feels rather like Carcassonne, the tiles being similar, even though the gameplay is nothing remotely the same. It's basically an abstract with a small element of randomness in which tiles you draw - and (based on just one play) it seemed a perfectly decent one. But not ultimately very interesting either. Most of the tactics involved seemed fairly obvious even on a first play, so unless we both missed some more complex plays, it's probably not all that replayable anyway. We have since sold this game.

Nobody is ever interested in playing this game... A pity, because it's a true hidden gem. Lots of risk taking, opportunity weighing and opponent out-manoeuvering.

What a surprise, the patented move a stack and leave your trail behind you mechanic. This is a Dorn game alright.  

Well, what should be the same 'ol, same 'ol, really isn't.  I was surprised how much I liked it.  Many tough little choices, in how you are going to use your knights.  Blocking and baiting for larger targets are essential.  The dilemma in the game is that there are very few safe moves so you have to take your turns according to how inefficient you want to be to protect yourself. I like the forests forcing the cost of the Knights. Great for two as well.

1 play.

A simple, tactical, abstract area-control game. Everyone has the same tile mix, but a little bit of randomness in the order of the tile draw should decrease AP. Also, having only 2 tiles in hand should help the game move along faster. To play well, however, it seems you would need to know what is in each group of tiles -- would've been nice if that was on a player aid or something! Better graphics, including something telling you the movement/VP info for each tile, would have been nice, too. I think I'd like it more, but my first play was with someone (Mary!) who HATES area-control-screw-your-neighbor-take-their-stuff games!

Each player has an identical set of tiles, arranged with B's on top and E's on bottom. Of the 4 A tiles, choose a castle and another tile for your hand; the others (from all players) form a random starting play area. On your turn, you place 1, 2 or 3 tiles, immediately drawing a replacement after each placement. These are played one at a time, and must be orthogonally adjacent to what's already on the board. They may not extend beyond the play area (7x7, 9x9, or 10x10 for 2er, 3er, or 4er). If a placed tile has a castle, you bring 0-5 knights (discs) into play onto that castle. Then, you may move those knights in a straight line, placing a number of knights on each tile entered (including the castle) based on terrain: plains=1, forest=2, mountains=3 (lakes impassable). Max total of 4 knights/tile at end of movement; if you can't enter a hex (e.g., forest with 3 knights present), you may not move beyond it. May not skip any tiles. If other player knights are present, place yours in a stack on top. The game ends when everyone has played all their tiles. Earn VP based on tiles controlled (knight on top of stack controls tile): castle=1VP, village=2VP, town=3VP. Most VP wins! Tie-breaker = most unused knights.

The author's recurring idea of starting with a stack of pieces and moving it, leaving a trail (as seen in Louis XIV, Mykerinos, Traders of Genoa, etc.), is finally distilled down to its purest form, where it is pretty much the whole game.  I think the idea is at its best here, and is still only very slightly interesting.

This is a great game tile laying game. 2 tiles in your hand gives you a choice and you can lay up to 3 tiles in your turn. But you only have a limited amount of tiles (as each person has 24) You also have a limited amount of knights to play (30 for each player) It's a balancing act between going for VP's and leaving yourself tiles and knights to be able to take advantage of other players who might use up their pieces too quickly.

Queen was extremely generous at BGG.CON 2009 where they gave every attendee a copy of Aton, Robber Knights, or Roma, plus they ran Chicago Express and Alhambra contests with great prize giveaways. I was lucky enough to get copies of Robber Knights and Chicago Express, although fitting them into my luggage was quite a challenge. I've had both Aton and Roma for some time and enjoy both a lot. They're two of the best 20-30 minute two-player games I have, but I was skeptical of Robber Knights because I hadn't heard anything about this 2005 release. I've played it three times now and it turns out that it's an overlooked and underrated game. It's another 20-30 minute two-player game, but this one is by Rudiger Dorn and uses his signature "breadcrumbs" mechanic, which you may be familiar with from Traders of Genoa, Louis XIV, or Goa. That is, players drop a number of discs (representing knights) onto the board and then proceed to "walk" the knights across the board to claim towns, villages, and castles, always leaving at least one behind where they walk. It's an interesting game because it combines the Dorn "breadcrumbs" mechanic with a fairly standard tile-laying game, which is a very different context for this mechanic than the other Dorn games mentioned above. I appreciated that the game rules include a common Carcassonne variant of holding two tiles and thus having a choice of which to play. It's a light and quick game, but a solid entry in the pantheon of light and quick two-player games.

I am a big fan of Dorn, especially since Goa ranks quite highly on my list of favorite games. That being said, this game is puzzling...I think I don't like it that much due to the luck of the draw in tiles, but I am not sure if it is due to my inability to see the opportunities on the play area needed to win. Perhaps this game has more subtle layers than I give it credit, but again, it is not that clear to me. Perhaps it is just that simplistic and there is nothing to it, but this game still puzzles the heck out of me. Perhaps that is a good sign?

Played once, 4 player.  Interesting abstract game, simple rules, attractive to look at.  When we played we were all quite conservative in that almost every village or town claimed received sufficient knights that it couldn't be retaken - and I think we thereby wasted too many knights on the villages leaving too few for the end-game.  I'd like to think an alternative approach was viable, minimising the initial knight outlay, expecting to lose some holdings but to (re)capture others, but that remains to be seen.

Unlike some commentators here, I look forward to becoming familiar with the tile distribution, as being able to anticipate your next couple of draws will allow some lucrative set-ups.

There are a ton of tile placement games out there, and most all of them have some interesting mechanism going on in their designs to make them somewhat interesting.  In Robber Knights, that interesting thing is the size limit of the grid.  It means that there can be some manipulating the board to get certain areas locked in to allow you to score them without competition.  Unfortunately, that's about all there is to it, and the game designer who played it with me (not the one who designed this game) commented that the game was degenerate, because once players understood the strategy, it would be a slow game of placing tiles one at a time, and then an end game of going all out to place their castles and score the largest parts of the board.  It sounds interesting still, but I can think of several other tile-laying games I would play before this one.  It just doesn't have enough to carry it in the end.

Disappointing to me.  Not what I expected out of Rudiger Dorn.  This is a dry abstract game with a theme lightly pasted on.  Kind of reminds me of a typical late model Knizia game :)

very different, depending on number of players (with 4 you can place all your tile, with 3 you can't). Sitting behind a bad players is a very big advantage.

Very much like Carcassonne, it has the same cosy feeling about it when you play ^^ A tad more complicated, which is good since you can play it over and over again without getting bored :D

Played a few times (with 3 or 4 players). A pleasant game with clever mechanisms, reasonable luck (knowing how many castles are in each group of tiles helps), and some interesting choices. Quite nice overall, although the tiles might have been made easier to recognize.

Quick playing and not very complicated.  Interesting strategies and tactics present themselves making for a very interesting little game.  Do you spend your knights early to secure points and risk running out or do you leave points open to potential capture in order to preserve your knights for future opportunities?

While not an impressive game, it is probably the most portable of all games I've seen. 5 mins of rules and a little ziplock bag of bits for each players and you're set to go. Great for the suitcase.

Very interesting, quick game, which features Dorn's trademark tower-trail mechanism.  This time, the tower has to work harder to cross certain terrains.  Quite nice!

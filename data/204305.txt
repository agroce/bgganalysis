Wow. This is the story-based board game that I've been looking for. This one does it all. I love the thrill and the simple framework that's here. We tried a one-off campaign and got slaughtered against Holmes' superior intellect!

This is immediately my #1 game to play with my wife as well as my #1 story-based game. I absolutely cannot wait to dive into more plays of this gem.

Clever, thematic, and quality. But beating Sherlock is ridiculous... those leaps of deduction literally don't make sense. Play for the story, not for the win.

West End Adventures is a 10 for me (even if the last case wasn't particularly good), but the Jack the Ripper Cases I found much less enjoyable.  I play games to relax and have fun, not read grizzly details about real life serial killers.

RATING: 7
The Ripper case is off the scale difficult.  The fourth part transitions from difficult to annoying, with its heavy opening prompt to focus on the time of the murder alone and to find it out quickly.  That's only so if you had deduced the Ripper's identity by the end of chapter three and  need this final piece of information merely to confirm your brilliance.  And if anyone has managed to find George Hutchinson at a location that isn't in the directory, please geekmail to tell me how.

Goldberg and Grady were the originals and the best at this.  Their six West End Adventures have some entertaining thematic flourishes: the murder of an actor playing Sherlock, a scandal involving the Prince of Wales, and the murder of a Transylvanian Count.  Though for my taste, the last of those is too quick to dismiss vampirism.    All except the final case are well done.  A Simple Case of Murder asks us to believe that the many staff of a wealthy household were all deaf and blind.  

More among the Ripper cases than the West End ones, there are some disappointing failures, either of research or translation.  Minister of the Interior instead of Home Secretary, Treasurer instead of Chancellor,  quarter penny instead of farthing, Head Inspector instead of Chief Inspector,.  Then there are the Americanisms - guys, jerks and (argh!) gotten.   The Ripper chapters cap it all with some peculiarly worded passages that suggest poor translation.    

Space Cowboys has done its usual gorgeous production job.  The artwork is also excellent.

Feels as much a choose your own adventure as a board game, not that i think that is a bad thing it just feels a different experience.  Watch a traditional murder mystery in your home and pause it before the palour scene where everything is revealed and debate it with those in the room and you have a similar experience although without the "investigating" of the system.  The system works well and I could see it being used in lots of different and possibly more adventurous ways.  Unlike the "escape rooms" this doesnt give you lots of out of place logic puzzles to solve but it is set in a non-realistic setting of crime novel cliches ..which is I guess what people wanting a Sherlock Holmes game will want.  Can be solo or coop - would be interesting to give 2 groups a copy and see who can solve first with the least clues...  The system is not without its flaws, it can easily stall, if you fail to make one of the leaps of logic the game wishes you to it can sort of spoil that case whether it is not checking out a key location or just not seeing how it all comes together. There are lots of minor leads and regular "helpers" that kind of end up giving clues to minimise this but it is still a flaw.  Generally I will rather read a crime novel and guess the ending than do this game but I still like how different it is and how fun and satisfying it can be when everything comes together.  The Ripper cases are a bit odd.  Not entirely sure they work well and they are certainly less interesting and enjoyable than standard cases but they are different and so I kind of like that side of it.

RATING: 8
Completing a scenario felt more like completing a book than playing a board game. It's quite a fresh take for a board game. Get a good cup of tea brewing, good company and a pen and paper; and you're good to go. This game is not meant to be played when you're feeling tired cause there's a lot of reading and you need to digest all the information you received. Components and cases are very well done. 

You really feel like you're investigating a case, going after different leads, hitting dead ends now and then leaving you stumped and frustrated. Satisfying when you finally manage to crack a case. 

However, replayability is zero once all the scenarios are solved so I probably sell it then.

Have not played the original, but wow, what a unique experience.  There are games starting to come out that steal elements from this game... but this game came out in the 80's.... so its a bit shocking that only now we are starting to see an evolution on this type of design.  The scoring is a bit wonky, and it does seem impossible to come up with the best solution like Sherlock, but its a lot of fun trying to figure out what is going on, in as little time as possible.  Looking forward to exploring all the available cases for this one.

Wanted to like this more.  The first few adventures were fun and had us engaged... over different sessions we realized that the "clues" were just too small for our brains and we were randomly grasping straws, making guesses, and getting irritated that the answers to the crime were so deliberately hidden DEEP inside trivial details.  We don't mind feeling stupid...but trading cool  "Oh, how did we miss that?" moments for lame "Wait, THAT is what they wanted us to consider?!!" results left us feeling underwhelmed.

A fantastic iteration of this system, my second favorite in the series (I'm including Mythos Tales here), with Gumshoe still reigning supreme, despite its massive flaws.

The Jack the Ripper campaign is the primary draw here, with the additional West End cases taking a back seat. This historical, grisly series of cases are linked together and culminate with the possibility of catching the maniac. The chilling real-world facts behind the cases make for a contemplative experience and make up for the fact that they're more difficult and less tidy from a solution perspective than the West End and original SHCD cases. Anyone who enjoys this system needs to play through the Jack the Ripper campaign.

Picked this up to play with my 11yo daughter.  Great fun.  We spent a good 5-6 hours or so hours on "case 5"  over 2 days of play.  We ended up with 50 points and getting most of the questions correct.  Looking forward to the next cases and picking up the updated original version of the game.  Fun game, that is well written and pulls you into the case.

First impression score is a 10. I have played halfway (I think) through case #5 and I give this game a 10. How can I possibly do that, having never played the game before this new version? I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT THE CASE! No other game has had me so intrigued and consumed with finding out the answer. I love it! I can't wait to get back to following more leads.

Edit: We finished the first case. The score is remaining a 10 because of how much my wife and I enjoyed the experience.

Brilliant game. Playing it is not just playing a game, it's an experience. You won't feel like Sherlock Holmes - it will take you far too many leads to get the answers for each case - but you will feel like you had a very nice evening solving a crime. It has it's problems, but man I wish there were (many) more games like this.

RATING: 8.5
This is not a game in common sense, it looks more like an activity/reading/solving cases. Anyway, you will have great time playing this.
The box contains 10 cases, first four are somehow connected into one big story using its own map. The rest of six cases are separated each solving own story.
In every case you will follow the clues, investigate (interview) witnesses, trying to find what's going on. You can visit special places like dissecting room to ask the dissector about the corpse foundings, you can ask local newspapers for information, there is also a big book of people living in London so if you can find them there you can visit them to gain some valuable information as well.
You will get some number of case questions (for example who was the murderer, what was his motive, how did he do it and so on) and when you feel you know the answer (or you think you cannot find anything new) you can finish and    check your answers with the Sherlock Holmes findings. 

What I like:
- You have total freedom where you can go, whom to visit (at worst he wouldn't be involved in the case so you won't get any information) so everything is just up to you and your deduction how will you process the case
- Everything is the top notch quality. The stories are interesting, captivating and well written, The story book is nice, map and people index is well produced. The best looking thing are the newspapers though. They are absolutely brilliant, looking as if they were original and  it can be also source of interesting information (although most content is just irrelevant, but still very flavorful)
- You actually feel as if you were detective solving some murder case, writing notes about the case, trying to figure the time frame and the motives of each suspects, you are hooked totally until the case is finished. Very strong experience and memorable moments.

What I dislike:
- The language used there is somehow harder for non-native English users. If this would be translated into my native language, I would be thrilled to get this. It is OK when playing by myself, but when I need to translate everything when playing with people who don't speak English, it could be very exhausting. Also some little clue could be easily missed due to the translation process.
- Also plan to have plenty of time to solve the case. I don't recommend to stop and start next time (unless it would be next day) because you would forget a lot from the case and it could be hard to continue where we stopped. The case 5 took us 5,5 hours to finish (we visited a lot of clues and also the translation took a lot of time).
- When you finish the case it would probably mean you cannot play it anymore because you know everything. So replayability is not there - you play this once only. But still you got 10 cases so you probably spend cca 30-40 hours on this game, which is fine. Also maybe you can go back to this after several years when you probably forgot most of it. Or you can serve as a game master in next session letting other people decide what to do and just be there for the atmosphere.
- I wouldn't recommend to play this game competetively trying to solve the game as fast as possible scoring the best score. You probably cannot beat Holmes anyway and it is just pointless to finish the case as fast as possible instead of enjoying the atmosphere and visit as much people as you can to get more clues about the case. This game is not about the destination, it is the journey which  is fascinating. To cut the journey to the maximum will cause loosing some great experience. So, take some time, don't rush, and enjoy this as you cannot go back to this anymore.

This is hardly a game. Really, you're just following the crumbs unveiling the story. I would say for most part the game is research, not deduction. Also, this is mostly a solitaire experience.

We have gone through 8 of the 10 cases, but it is really hard for me to formulate an opinion about the game. This is the only version of SHCD I have ever played.  In my opinion there are two sides of the game:

1. The bare design: The idea of the game is incredibly good. The fact that one has to travel to different places to find the clues, the newspapers and the map, the illustrations, the atmosphere of the era... and I did not expect it, but the writing style is also very enjoyable. This game is super immersive.

2. The actual cases: There are a few nice ones, but I didn't like most of them. It was partly my fault: Before playing the game, I expected that they will be structured as interwoven threads of subtle clues. The clues will be hidden as organic parts of the story line and through different paths will inevitably lead to the same conclusion. It is not like that, which is understandable as each case only covers about 20 pages. So expecting something so intricate was not realistic at all. They are more like mazes where some information is hidden here and there. (These are dumb metaphors, but I don't have any better idea on how to describe these stuff.) You run through them fairly methodically, find out some stuff automatically and at the end you read the questions which - with some exaggeration - tell you which information were actually important and which weren't. I would not have a problem with this, but quite often it is completely random what your next step should be and the solution is really often not very satisfying. (Also there are typos, but they are not that bad.) Regarding the Jack cases: We haven't yet finished the last two as the two we did made us feel quite uncomfortable. That's maybe also good to take into account before buying this version of SHCD.  

So, I don't know. Really cool idea, the production value is exceptional, has a really strong atmosphere and there are some pretty nice ideas in a few cases. But I was generally disappointed. I understand that my initial expectations were too high, but even so I just don't think that the cases make a good puzzle.

This game is rated R and for good reason.  Unlike the other Sherlock Holmes adventures, the Jack the Ripper cases go deep into the real life history of the crime.  That makes them very different, as all the other are works of fiction whereas this is most certainly not.  But getting to the end of a four case game and thinking you might actually know who Jack the Riper is is such a satisfying feeling.  If you're not afraid of descriptive gore, you might just fall in love with this one.

First things first: Yes, this game has essentially no mechanisms. You (or a group) read the introduction, and then decide where to go from there. It's a choose-your-own-adventure mystery. At the end, you compare yourself to the famed fictional sleuth, and that's that.

With that unpleasantness out of the way, let's examine what Sherlock Holmes - Consulting Detective really is: A brilliantly-written, clever game of deduction that works just as well with groups as it plays solo.

This can be played and enjoyed by people of all skill and experience level, and although it can be controlled by alpha gamers, that's really the only issue I have.

When I'm not playing this game, I find myself thinking of it -- like any good story, I suppose. Additional cases can't come quickly enough for me.

Oh, and as for the lack of replayability, try giving it another spin with a different group. Already solved the cases with your regular gaming friends? Play it with your family or non-gaming pals. Sit back, gently guiding them, and you'll be able to have fun in an all-new way.

I think the score at the end of the game is not important but the moment you know all the answers: who was the culprits, why did they do what they did. In short, playing with case was a great adventure to me.

Only played through one case so far. I really enjoyed the game and they way it flowed. Sometimes you get stuck of go down the wrong path and the game lets you. Then you ask for help and the excitement builds as you realise you're close to the truth. The writing is excellent and you feel like a detective. 

I don't want to spoil anything for anyone so I can't give any details. But some of the less important "answers" didn't seem explained clearly. But that's my only criticism. 

I can't wait to play through the rest of the cases.

Edit: Second play through and my issue with the answers not being explained wasn't a problem here. I think that issue was more likely one with my brain than the game!

However, the box is a slip case a little smaller than the Yatori version of the original game. Was going to put base game in slipcase, but books and newsprint papers are just shy of fitting in the box. Other than that, great to have it in my collection.

Rozwiązywanie zagadek kryminalnych niczym SH, czytając gazety (teksty z pudełka nie z kiosku) i jeszcze zeznania (chyba). Cała gra to tak naprawdę czytanie i prawdziwa dedukcja. Jednorazowa. Warto grać w dwie osoby. Na końcu odpowiada się na pytania (chyba) i porównuje się odpowiedzi z jakąś kartą odpowiedzi czy coś. Kilka zagadek kryminalnych w jednym pudle. Wydana wiele lat temu teraz wznawiana z nowymi jak i starszymi zagadkami. W Polsce Rebel ogłosił że najpierw wydadzą część z nowymi zagadkami. Miała wyjść w 2017 roku, jednak przeniesiono premierę na IIIkw 2018r gdyż tłumaczenie wymaga bardzo dużo pracy i korektą mają się zająć tłumacze literatury a jednocześnie miłośnicy SH. Tu również nieprawidłowe tłumaczenie może uniemożliwić rozwiązanie zagadek więc warto poczekać.

A very challenging game but very very satisfying. Yes it can be extremely frustrating since there are not clear directions and if you miss something it is hard to figure out what you missed.  The information to solve the cases can be found. Holmes does cheat frequently (i.e. doesn't go to locations but yet knows information). This version does not seem to have the same translation issues as  Yasari's print of the original game.

More of a reading activity than a game to be honest - a choose your own story as you decide where you want to investigate. At the end you have questions based on what you have read to test what you can deduce from this. I imagine it could be good for two-players, but I think it might actually just be best solo.

Quick Blurb: I have only played this a few times but I already know that this is a simply amazing game. I highly suggest this game for groups and it is a great way to introduce non-gamer people to board games. Incredibly simple rules that give the game a world of depth.  

My opinion:

In short, I really enjoyed this game, it allowed me to play a more complex game with my friends who normally are not into my kinds of games, the game was also enjoyed by my dedicated gaming group. It’s appeal to both groups really puts it over the top for me. The game can only be played 10 times through since it has 10 cases, 4 of which form a campaign- but even with that the game is still worth it. 

Important Notes and Criticisms:

> Player Count: While this game is listed as being able to entertain 1-8 players, I would never bring more than 4-5 into the game.
      This game is great for smaller groups of interested/ invested players. I would highly suggest this game as an evening relaxation/ rainy day event. While I did enjoy playing it solo, the game really shines when you play it with people you are close to, whether that be your S/O, your family, or a good group of friends. 

> Scoring: The scoring system in the game is brutal, but and I think it somewhat detracts from the game. If you wanna have fun in a casual group, I highly suggest you don't fret your score at all. While I see this system may appeal to some players, I think it could be improved somewhat.
      The game says you should challenge yourself and try and be a better investigator than Sherlock Holmes, who always scores 100 out of ~120 or so and your investigation is scored by judging your solve against his. You get 10-20 points for each fact about the case you correctly solved, but then you lose 5 points for every extraneous lead you followed, that Sherlock did not use during his search. While this second part may not seem that damaging, Sherlock Holmes is just the same genius that he was is in the books, meaning he uses almost no leads. 
     For example, during my group's first case (Case #5), after about two hours of running around Victorian London digging up leads we decided that we finally had enough info to understand what was going on. We ended up correctly solving almost everything about the main case and scored over 100 points! Our excitement/pride was quickly crushed, however, for, while Sherlock used only a mere 6 leads to solve the case, we ended up using 26. 
    My problem with the scoring system is that, while challenging yourself to beat Sherlock sounds like it would be fun, I think it goes against the actual *fun* part of the game. Since each case can only be attempted once, if you want to try and beat Sherlock you have to take a large risk, and may ruin one of your limited play-throughs. Also, most of fun in this the game comes from investigating lots of leads, following the red-herrings, and getting immersed in wild speculation and discussion - and the scoring system goes against this entirely and punishes the players for doing this. Again, while I see this system may appeal to some players, I think it could be improved somewhat.
 
Overall 9/10 game - Play in groups with friends and don't fret your score

Purchased for solo play but have found that it works very well with multiple people as well. Not like any other board game in that the satisfaction doesn't come from beating opposing players or even the game itself, but rather from solving the case using your (and your group's) own method of detecting. It's like playing out your favorite Holmes mysteries for yourself. 

As mentioned in other reviews, it is more of an activity than a game and should be treated as such. If you're looking for a more competitive game, try Pandemic (cooperative) or Watson and Holmes.

First Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detecting game we've played (never played the original). It works as a stand alone game. We are following the game's suggesting that for beginners, you start with case 5 and save the independent Jack the Ripper cases for later. So far it is a great experience. Even though each case is a one-time play through, it seems well worth its price tag.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Scratches a special itch that no other game I've played has yet even come close to. This has been a wonderful experience so far. There's so much tension in trying to not follow too many or too few leads; but, all the while, you are absorbed with the setting and the characters. It's fantastic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Essentially the same game as the original, but with a four-mystery story arc revolving around Jack the Ripper. It sounds nice, but unfortunately the Jack the Ripper cases are very poorly written. The six stand-alone cases are still very very, as you would expect from a Consulting Detective game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
For cases 5-10: Fun non-linear deduction game that tests your ability to approach a problem from many different angles and think outside the box. Great coop game that encourages discussion and human interaction. I would highly recommend the game because of these cases.

For cases 1-4 (Jack the Ripper cases): These ones were definitely not as fun for several reasons. They may be a better simulation of actual, tedious police work, but this is not very fun to do. The cases also have very little charm and are real downers. I also have some beefs with the questions that determine your score at the end of the case. I don't think the questions for these ones really measure how much you have figured out. I also don't like that they have a limit of 15 leads, so you may have to end the case before you are ready.

What I don't like about the game is that if you go somewhere where you're not supposed to be yet, the "narrative" falls apart and feels out of place.

Doesn't feel much like a board game.
Mostly you go to different places and read a lot of text.

Played the intro scenario, got -5 points (all answers right, way too much reading). Not overly convinced of a system where the decision whether you press on, convinced that your story may be a red herring, or you stop and see if you actually had all important content is a good game mechanic. When reading a crime story, you know where the ending is and you can make your guess with the knowledge that everything you should know has been given to you. But storywise it was very cleverly built, and ultimately who cares about points.

RATING: 4
Definitely entertaining, up until score counting, just like I remember from the original, back in the 80s. Holmes solves the case by magic, as usual. The game's production value, concept and writing is superb - but scoring is just silly. You get more out of it if you laugh off, or simply ignore, scoring. Which is what I'll do, and also not race to beat Holmes (meaningless), rather take my time and enjoy the puzzle. Would work very well as cozy evening fun for two players!

Going into the Ripper case. Their scoring is severely flawed. I knew this would happen, but going into a historical case I also happen to be a buff about, it's turning into a problem. They're making unhistorical assumptions that are VERY doubtful, and scoring for random irrelevant stuff that's clearly worth a downgrade. Bye bye initial rating 7. Will see if the next scenario changes anything. I really want to like this game.

The process of discussing and solving was fun - I'd prefer to deal with a wholly fictitious case myself however, preferably gentleman jewel thief or anarchist plot against Duke of Zenonia. Ripperologists may find a lot to like here, if only the opportunity to display their unsettlingly deep knowledge of obscure details of a 130 year old series of brutal dismemberings. The text is poorly written (translated?) as far as evoking any atmosphere goes - frequently being addressed as “guys” by the NPCs was grating.

[thing=204305][/thing] is, well, an unusual game, and follows the exact same way as [thing=2511][/thing].

First, the amount of rules: read the introduction of the case. Now, go wherever you want whenever you want (following the map by using the Directory, which contains the adresses of everyone of interest, and also the adress of several business locations) and talk (read) with the people there. Read the newspaper of the day, if pleases you. Also, you might want to talk with some fine folks that usually are aware of things (like Mycroft, journalists, go to the morgue or Scotland Yard, and such). Now, also whenever you want, you can return to present your fiddings regarding the case to Sherlock. The booklet will contain some questions, each will be worth an amount of points. Then, for every location you went above the number of those that Sherlock did, you will lose 5 points. Now, compare the amount you achieve with that of Holmes (he always gets 100 points). Then, you can feel good or bad, depending on how well you did. And that is it. Well, less than it, actually, since my last bit of feelings is more a thing I added. That is all the rules.

In every case you will have at your disposal: the booklet of the case (you can always consulte passages you read), the newspaper, the Directory (the adress of many things and persons in London) and the map of London, and this one, by the way, one of the players (we played in 4 people) thought it was utterly unnecessary, since how close one thing is to other, or the relation of one to another, wasn't playing any roll in the case. But then, in the end, the game hit us hard in the nutsack for not using it properly (you know, as a map). So great.

[thing=204305][/thing] is, probably, one of the most pure experiences of playing that one can have. There is no board (the map is not a board, you don't take action on it, you use it, as I pointed out, as a reference), no meeples, no pieces, no tokens, no money, no cards, no keeping rounds (though, you can see every new location as a new round), no gameplay time as we usually time it. What there are: reading and talking. After the reading of what happened in the case we started discussing: where to go? With whom to talk? What information we had? What means this or that? What about visiting the school for girls? And after we decided to go to a place, and the reading of what occurred there, we returned to the discussions. And now what? What we take it from this? Which lines/leads we now can follow? Usually quite a few, but it was worth our time to follow most of them? Which was more likely to actually advance our case? What was the place - or the person - with the best chances of providing clues? We compared notes, explored options, created scenarios - this because of this and this. Yes... but what about [i]this[/i]? Well, [i]this[/i] I can't explain properly right now. So, which place or person would shed light on this matter? I think this one. But wouldn't he just say what we already know? Then, we can take a chance here. Yes, it can work. And things went this way during the whole game. [thing=204305][/thing] is a game of pure deduction, taking notes, clashing options.

A play of [thing=204305][/thing] ends when the players want. You can visit 10 places, 50 or two. The decisions is yours, always. You know you are "running" against Holmes, but you did not know how many places/persons he went/talked to. I doubt that in any of the cases Sherlock needed to go to 50 places to solve the case, but the main question here is: which is worth more - beating Holmes or solving the case? For us it was solving the case, and only after we had a solid overall view of most of the things in the case, and a scenario that answered (for us) most of our own questions, that we went to see the end result. And this can't be taken lightly: once you read the solution of the case, you probably won't be able to ever playing it again since the challenge will be gone. There aren't any variations in the set up, nor event cards, nor different characters to take - the case will always be the same, the result will be the same, the clues will be in the same places.

So, yes, [thing=204305][/thing] has a "due date" - after the 10 cases, it is over. Except by reasons of really weak memory, disease and amnesia, even many years after playing you won't be able to fully enter a play of one of the cases (since, you might start not remembering things, but then something clicks, you remember, and now you basically can't participate). However, this is all that much important? There are lots of games I bought and probably won't clock 10 plays of them. But, more relevant, a game that gives you 10 memorable experiences? For us, every one of them were.

The amount of work of the authors in the cases is awe inspiring - the newspaper and so many places with informations (most not relevant, but there, anyway). The only thing I wished it was present in the game was an internal clock - but I know this would make the game way more linear, so I'm fine without it. However, for those that want to enjoy something in the likes of this, you can download some of the Sherlock Holmes Solo Mysteries (a game book series) [url=http://www.abandonia.com/pt/gamebooks#Sherlock+Holmes+Solo+Mysteries]here[/url] - or go after the actual books (but they somewhat old).

This recent edition is also quite marvelous - sturdy booklets, great graphics (but I would like if the cases booklets were color-coded by region) and a box I would be proud to be on display.

They were nights of talks, exploring in our minds. We visited places, talked to people - and even when going to only 10 different places, still the play lasted for almost four hours! The play reminded me of when, in college, we discussed books in the class of literary analysis - many views trying to reach an overall acceptance of the intent of the whole thing. 

Baker Street Irregulars to the work!

Unsure how to rate this.  You have to be in the right mood to play and enjoy, but if in the mood, it seems like it deserves higher than the suggested 6ish (right mood) rating.  For it's genre, it seems great.  I'm not sure if I'm super in to this genre, though.  Writing is solid and the main plots good, though some of the side questions seem barely supported.

First case (non-ripper) was great fun - expecting to enjoy this as much as the amazing first 10 cases.

after 6 games = Jack campaign + 2 cases

same comment as the base game, it's more of an activity than a game

Jack campaign is very very hard and I often felt very lost, I did not enjoy it overall;

on the other end of the spectrum, the first 2 cases are on the easy side and much more to my liking, especially the second which has a fun premise.


after 10 cases

I enjoyed the West-End cases way more than Jack the Ripper campaign

I think there was a wide range of thematics (theatre, domestic politics, foreign politics, aristocracy, etc.) quite a few surprises (other murders while investigating), I still don't like having to go back over 4,5,6 journals to find some intel, I still think scoring is irrelevant, overall I enjoyed it.

Really enjoying playing this with my daughters. Not sure it works well as a game, but is definitely a fun activity.

Was not happy with case #7, though. I'll avoid spoilers, but there were way too many gaps in reasoning on this one, and the eventual "solution" made us all a bit furious.

More great stuff of the same. I just wish for the deduction genre at large that there was more subject matter out there besides Jack the Ripper.

More of an experience than an actual board game, but definitely great fun. I can't imagine how much work must have been put into the creation of the different scenarios.

Like an elaborate, extremely difficult, solo/co-op version of a Choose Your Own Adventure mystery. Better starting place than the original SHCD:The Thames Murders & Other Cases.

*Start with cases 5-10 first (in order) and then the Jack the Ripper saga (1-4)

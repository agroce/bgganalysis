RATING: 7
A pretty deep optimisation game hidden under a fun veneer, unfortunately there may be just one core winning strategy.
Especially helps sitting to the left of the weakest player.

Second play: if everyone knows to optimise duplicating the big gems then the game is about finessing around that, which sort of works. But it is still a slow game with substantial downtime.  Maybe 2-3 players is best.

Played with 3, better, rating raised 6 to 7

Super quality components and one of the few games I've ever seen that comes in a box sized for what's inside it. Cool theme, nice illustrations and fun combination of Dig-Dug and deckbuilding. Lots of downtime, though, since it's hard to use your oponents turns to plan your next move. If it weren't for that it would have been an 8. As it is now, the very frustrating downtime, even in a 2 player game, almost makes it a 6.

A relatively light deck-building game (and fairly light theme-wise as well). Although I'm not a fan of deck-builders, this is definitely one of the better deck-builders out there, and FAR better than Trains! 

Negatives? A little long for what it offers: ending the game can take forever since the end has to be triggered by someone, and no one will want to do that if they don't think they're going to win. But other than that, it's a great game!

Fun in my one play. "Space Dig Dug" in a deckbuilder. Slightly vulnerable to AP as there are always a bunch of decisions to make, but this makes it interesting. Weird Soviet-vibe art.

Amazing graphic design and presentation.  The game was enjoyable, however I would not rush to play it again; I cannot see much variety here.  The game a little too much luck for my taste (for this style of game): Players can find themselves in an excellent situation through other player's game play, instead of their thoughtful planning.  The same goes for the minor achievement cards.

RATING: 9
Let me start off by saying that Super Motherload is an immensely entertaining game. It blends 2 mechanics that can be difficult to put together, tile placement and deck building. It is not the only game to do this, but it manages to combine them in a way that makes everything seem to come together incredibly well, and make for a unique and  entertaining experience.

Your first time playing, it may take you awhile to setup the game, as there are several parts that need to be sorted through. But after your initial setup, and subsequent play through, it should be pretty easy to replay from then on out. This is due to Super Motherloads's simplicity. In any given turn, there are only 3 actions that can be taken, draw, drill, and bomb. By making draw an action, the game forces you think through your combinations and manage your turns, so that you are not left with actions and no cards. You use the cards you draw either drill or bomb. Both are used to place tunnel tiles on the game board to collect the various pieces of treasure, and special items. You then use this treasure by placing it on your stacks of cards in your buy area. This is both Super Motherloads most interesting mechanic, and its weakest. You must place all of the treasure you obtained on the same card stack, meaning that you have to carefully plan where you tunnel to get the amounts that you want. This is actually one of my favorite parts, as it allows you to build a strategy to "combo" your card buying with special abilities that the cards have when they are purchased. The only real drawback to this mechanic, is that each player has the same piles of card that are sorted by the same color. Now while this means players can choose which cards to allocate their recourses too in order to refine their specific strategy, it leave less options then I would like to see.

Overall a very solid game, and I cant wait to work it into the rotation for my groups game nights.

I really enjoy this game. It gives me a very "Video Game" feel. I'm not the biggest fan of pure deckbuilders, so the board aspect of the game really appeals to me and how you do, in fact, interact with other players by how you drill into the earth. It's a really engaging game and I always have fun teaching and playing it with others.

An intuitive, fun deck builder which benefits a lot from having those digging boards, so you get a tactile feel when you Drill or Bomb tunnels through the rock to gain the resources you cover. Plenty of card combos for different benefits. Colorful, good looking, Roxley seems like it could very easily be the next Plaid Hat or Tasty Minstrel Games. In fact, having played the original video game this was based on, I can say with all honesty that I prefer this version...excellent design, a contender here in 2015.

Initial Impression: This game was released during the wave of deckbuilders and although it doesn't offer anything new in the way of cardplay, manipulating the board through the use of deckbuilding is interesting. The components of the game are well made, with good artwork. I particularly enjoyed the way a new board was placed below the old board as it truly gave a sense of travelling deeper into the ground. As you travel into the lower levels, the number of minerals become more abundant. This leads to some serious deck progression by the time the game ends. Overall, I enjoyed this game and would like to play it again.

Super Motherload (SM) oozes fun. It provides a decent mixture of theme and game play; doesn't overstay its welcome; and has a simple, intuitive rule set. The deck-building aspect is, perhaps, a bit slow, but individual turns can still include a powerful, satisfying combo. The satisfaction and fun are present even if the combination is pulled off by my opponent. For us, the fun and depth SM initially provides puts it in a similar category as base Roll for the Galaxy. SM is a bit lighter than Roll for the Galaxy and plays in a similar time (45-60 minutes), but SM still provides a similar depth in the available strategic and tactical choices. Unlike Roll for the Galaxy, however, I worry about SM's longevity due to the limited board combinations. The asymmetric factions may prove to be more impactful than first blush, but I doubt it.

Edit, Sept 2017: This, Isle of Skye, Via Nebula, K2 and Pandemic Iberia are my go to games for when friends or family who aren't gamers are around.

Really clever take on a deck building game.  The puzzle aspect of the main board is really cool, and the decisions throughout were interesting.

This game has a lot of potential to be great, but doesn't quite reach it.  It is a house rule away though.

I bought it after the perfect Kickstarter campaign for Roxley's second game Steampunk Rally.
Super Motherload was on my wishlist for a pretty long time, went off, went on again. The gameplay was pretty interesting, the artwork was impressive.

After it got available again we got it, played it and loved it. The movement on the board is a really cool twist for deckbuilding games. It takes the game to another level and offers so many choices.

I highly recommend this game even to people that got scared away from deckbuilding (for being repetitive and too simple).

I love this little game. It really feels like a video game. Rules are simple and gameplay is light, but decisions are tough and the game can get really tense as you hope your opponent(s) won't do what you want to do on your turn. For this reason, I like this best with two players. I'd love to see some expansions with different card powers and player boards.

Super nice game, but with two players, the games last a little bit too long for our taste. It essentially is an interesting deck building game, but it feels rather light with little "meat". The game desperately needs an (or multiple) expansions, and there is great potential for that, but without additional variability, we decided to let go of this game, as we have other games that feel more rewarding for the time it takes to play this game.

The spatial puzzle crossed with deckbuilder is neat. The dynamics around "all mined stones must go towards a single stack" felt both intriguing and frustrating, though more of the former. Tempo was tight. But even 2p, the board play felt much more tactical than I'd have liked - with more than that, there'd be more downtime and you'd have to wait for more your turn to figure out what you could do. I wish there were some analogue to Cavum's stations, where you could claim a small area of tunnel as yours and others couldn't go past it.

I am friends with the designer, a playtester of this game, and a member of the Game Artisans of Canada (GAC). We have an annual gathering called "Cardstock" where the GAC playtests all of its current games and I think I've been testing this game since 2009 or so. Gavan and Matt tested this game so intensively I was gobsmacked they were still testing in 2013, let alone 2014. Still, like the pros they are, they kept tightening every single bolt on this thing like it was a deep space telescope or something. The dedication these guys have to this design is borderline obsessive. If you want to play a game that is airtight, fast, furious, and most of all - adrenaline-pumping, just buy it. You will be satisfied.

Had a good time with this one, it's just that at the end of the game, we didn't see ourselves wanting another go at it. There aren't a lot of meaningful choices, but it's light and quick enough that it wasn't boring. The art was a delight and we enjoyed how easy it was to score the minor goals, just wished there was more long-term planning involved.

Super Motherload is a deckbuilding game with a board element. It's interesting that the tunnels made can be used by other players. you have to be very careful about setting up your opponents. this can be hard because you don't know what kind of cards they have in their hand. I think this works best with a lower player count because you have less time to wait between players turns, and it's hard to plan when the board is usually changing on people's turns. It's also different than most deckbuilding games because you don't draw cards after your turn. You have to spend precious actions to draw cards. My biggest complaint is that the cycling of the minor achievement cards can randomly benefit other players. Probably best to implement a 3 card display that will replace claimed achievements so you can do some proper planning. I thought it was a good game, but I just have to keep in mind that I do not like playing non-digital deckbuilding games. Definitely give it a try.

RATING: 6
As a fan of the MotherLoad online game, I was immediately entrenched in the theme of Super Motherload. Start your mining operation with next to nothing, stuck near the surface surrounded by low grade material, but after several passes you begin to turn your corps into a focused machine capable of lengthy drilling runs and huge (or precisely targeted) explosions. This drilling and bombing puzzle offers a slew of interesting options as do the asymmetric player decks. Unfortunately, drilling alone will not win the game, players must instead focus on achievements. The major achievements are quite boring, and divert focus from the most interesting parts of the game by demanding players pursue a handful of specific goals, which undoes the interesting aspects of the asymmetric decks. The minor achievements are a bit more interesting since they are often fun to complete and act as a short term race between the players. Overall, its a fun and nostalgic game, but without the legs to make it a staple.\

Awesome mix of deck building, tile placement & resource management working towards minor & major goals scoring victory points. Minor gripes are the somewhat lack of variety and the small start player advantage in a 2 player game (perhaps a solution there could be to give the starting player only 1 action ?). A little less control with full amount of players perhaps as well, so I'd say 3 playes is the sweet spot for this one.

Had no idea what to expect with this one as it was randomly brought out during an evening of games.  Ended up liking it! The "digging" aspect is pretty straightforward but the interesting stuff comes out of the gradual deck building and the correct timing of playing cards to your advantage.  Feels not like other deck builders I've played, which is a difficult thing to achieve in a somewhat limited basing for a game. A minor complaint I have is that it is that there isn't a whole lot of variety to the board, and you can at times be sorely limited by the cards in your hand.  The worst part of the game is the "minor achievements" which is one of those things where a player may have already achieved them through no planning and thus are able to claim them without any work being done. I really dislike things like that and it's a pretty significant part of the game.  There are ways to get rid of the minor achievement cards before a player can capitalize, but it's not a sure thing. Otherwise, I liked what else was going on in SM, though I'd worry about replayability as - again - there isn't a super amount of variety to the game, and it's a little long for something so simple at times.  Still, I think it's pretty good.a

Nice idea and blend of mechanisms.
There are many subtle nuances in the deck building and hand management. You can definitely have some great moves - like bombing this and that with a consequence of recieving some cards and some minerals that will acquire you a pilot on hand or give cards or more minerals, that will allow for even greater second move in your turn.
However, I'm not really sure about the replayability and the achievements. 
The first one - the deck building aspect closed to the small set of cards might give a similar syndrome as in case of Rococo or Arctic Scavengers - even though subtle changes matter a lot, the game may seem a little bit too samey after several plays.
The second one is quite luck based really. What I mean is - you find yourself in very lucky situation, while your opponent not so much. Hey - you need 3 bombs in your play-area? Good news - you already got them. 2 point for free with no effort.

Anyhow - pleasant gaming experience. Putting achievements aside - very nice, clean design. Nice game.
Probably a keeper.

Tons of fun. Art style for characters is weird and a bit off-putting, but the gameplay is great. I love working toward the goals, managing the board, and slowing improving my deck.
The game is very much NOT a deckbuilder in the traditional sense, but either way it's a good time.

I have been looking forward to this and what a great addition to the development community!  A's all the way around.  Linen finish and great quality.  Dripping wet theme with mechanical integration.  Deceptively quick play with very fun decisions and plenty to enjoy while playing.   Very streamlined and they did their own "best in class" intro video to boot. 

No, I bought my game and I never communicated with any involved in its production.

Maybe this isn't for everyone, but this production seems like the way it should be done from top to bottom. No Air in the box!  I could go on...  Congratulations to the designers.

The gem-cloning power seems a little strong, but I am hesitantly assuming that would balance out if all players knew about it. Similarly, ending the game is very powerful and you should know what you're doing if you give your opponent the chance to do it. For all that, a nice take on deckbuilding that's mostly more about the overall composition of your deck than about single big cards.

Love the aesthetic, and the really interesting integration of deckbuilding (Which I love) with this cool dig-dug board. Overall a really unique game. I haven't gotten the strategy of it yet, not careful enough about setting up my opponents. I'm personally a fan of deck thinning but it's nice to have all cards be useful and in play.

I think we played it wrong the first 3 times, playing properly and with only [b]two players[/b] made this game feel so much better. Still a bit of AP, but having less people meant that we still got the game done in a reasonable time frame. Some concern about faction balancing/the resource doubling being too strong. The only really terrible thing I can say about this game is that I keep losing....

[-]Seems very snowball-y, kinda wish there was a bit of a catchup mechanic. Rulebook hasn't been quite clear with timing in some cases. Hard to plan moves leads to some AP/longer downtimes; good game for the chess clock[/-]

I really like this deck-builder.  The gameplay is simple and original.  Plays well with any number of players.  Asymmetric starting decks are a plus.  The racing aspect for the objective cards is fun.  Only downside is that it can be hard to catch up with the leader if you get screwed out of good mineral veins early on.

(06/23/2015) Comment based on 6 plays.

This is a fast-paced, streamlined deck builder, with spatial tile-laying, resource gathering, sci-fi underground mining theme.

The comic book graphics and Soviet Mad Max-ish world are eye-catching, with interesting depictions of the four factions that are vying for resource supremacy. The game quickly draws one in, with furious action of playing cards to tactically drill for the best resources, so that one can hire additional pilots for better drilling options. The main play centers around a series of boards, where players drill tunnels "down" into the Martian underground, overlaid with a grid and scattering of various resources, each with varying degrees of dollar value. There are five kinds of "terrain": dirt, rock, and three different metal-encased dirt. As a player drills over a grid spot with a resource, they collect that resource and then immediately allocate it as payment towards the hiring of one of four pilots, each with a hiring cost.

Like any deck builder, each player starts with a deck with minimal capabilities. There are three kinds of "suits", red, blue, or yellow, that allow drilling through the three different kinds of metal-enclosed dirt. Otherwise, they can drill through ordinary dirt regardless of suit. However, they cannot drill through rock, which can only be blown-up with bombs that are activated with red drill cards. The red drill cards have explosion patterns that blow up two to four (and six depending on the faction) grids per bomb. As the players collect enough resources to hire a pilot, that pilot represented as a card gives a one-time benefit when hired, such as cards, bombs, extra action, splitting resources, or bring the card into hand. Otherwise, the card is placed in the discard pile. When the deck is exhausted, the discards are reshuffled like other deck builders. The new pilot(s) give additional capabilities, such as deeper drilling, cards, bombs, or other capabilities. Further, the new pilots come with progressively increasing amount of VPs that become relevant at the end of the game.

Throughout the game, players are not only competing for the resources on the board (since once a grid space is drilled and resource extracted, that grid space cannot be drilled again), but also for a number of minor and major public objectives. As the players drill deeper and deeper, the resources get more valuable, yet more challenging to extract. At the same time, the pilot cards are getting more expensive with each hire, although they are providing more VPs. There are sixteen total, four each in the three colors and four in a "wild" suit.

The play is fast and furious, with players eyeing for the juiciest resources, bombs, and artifacts, the last which can give surprising boosts in terms of additional resources, or other positive effects. However, it can be frustrating to watch resources that you were eyeing get snapped up by the player to your right. Still, the drilling by the other players can sometimes open up other avenues to reach more valuable resources. Every play opens up the board to the other players, so it is a balancing act of tactically drilling for specific resources, while eyeing strategic plays a turn or two later. There is plenty to think about here, but overall the decisions are simple. Thus, there is not too much downtime. The game clips along at a frantic pace, and a satisfying game can be had within 60 to 75 minutes, while feeling much longer. It is a solid "8". A fun romp in futuristic Martian mining, but may be a tad too random and/or chaotic for some.

RATING: 7
Great chill game. This one is smooth and easy. Perfect after a heavy game. It just feels right playing this! Sometimes downtimes can appear if you think too much about opportunities - just go with you gut instincts for the sake of the other players, its pretty straight forward.

I had my eye on Super Motherload for a while. While I was a bit surprised by how light the game was, I wasn't disappointed at all because the game was really fun. In this deck-builder, all cards represent drillers in one of three colors or a wild. Red drillers can also use bombs and each one bombs in a different pattern. You start with a deck of seven basic cards and a hand of four. The board is a grid of squares with various minerals, bombs and artifacts that you can acquire when you drill or bomb them. On your turn you take two actions between drilling, bombing or drawing 2 cards. When you drill, you can turn in a set of cards of the same color and drill through as many spaces in a straight line as you have drill symbols. The object is to collect minerals, which are worth money, to use to purchase more and more powerful drillers from your personal market. Once you drill out all of the artifacts on 3 or 4 boards (depending on player count) the game immediately ends. 

Some areas can only be bombed and some can only be drilled. You spend the game building off of each other's work to dig deeper and purchase your upgrades faster than the others. There are also major and minor goals that can be collected for points. At the end of the game you add up the points on your purchased cards, completed goals, and any artifacts that happened to be worth points (they have various effects). It's very straight forward game of getting the most you can without leaving obvious big plays for your opponents. The game plays best with 2-3, I think. I haven't played four players, but the downtime might be a bit much and the board state would change so much that it would be hard to plan between turns.

Kolejny zakup na wspieram.to i to jak najbardziej udany. Świetny i nietrudny do wytłumaczenia deckbuilder połączony z kombinowaniem, jak wiercić w ziemi, żeby przyniosło to jak największe profity. Ciekawe jest to, że każdy gracz ma swój zestaw kart, które może używać do rozbudowywania swojej talii. Do tego dodatkowe cele (małe i duże) dają poczucie, że ciągle się coś osiąga co zwiększa satysfakcję z obcowania z tym tytułem.

Cool combination of deck building and... action selection on a shared board?

Some downsides though. Timing issues and power resolution can be kinda iffy, especially the gem doubling one. And the examples in the rulebook also don't help.
Oh, and price. This game is almost double as expensive as it has any right to be. 50 bucks?! Jeezes. Roxley pulled this same crap with Santorini. It's a good game and I'm happy to have received it for free but wouldn't have bought it for that price.

Deck building meets tile placement. I must say that I don't care for Ascension (too much luck in the center deck and your draw) or Dominion (too static, feels like a puzzle/race to simply synergize the cards), but I actually really enjoyed the deck building in this game. The combos were not as crazy as what I was hoping for, but I've only played it once. I like that your deck is small enough so that you actually see cards many times throughout the game, but it's not too small (where you could anticipate your cards easily). The tile placement is very fun and actually has some 'depth' to it, since where you place could open up opportunities for your opponents. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed the fresh feel of this game. I like the theme, but my wife didn't care for the artwork, as it's not very bright and happy. This game is causing me to look at Steampunk Rally by Roxley, as well.

2017-03-04 - 6 - Just another deckbuilder with really ugly drawing on the cards - please, don't get inspired by Dominion artwork (worse half at least). I can play it as it's pretty quick and OK game, but at the same time I could never play it again. Those black tiles are really unconvenient when you cover what you were supposed to get and you don't see it.

Deck builder for a focus on gaining resources from the board, the game plays best at 2-3 players and clocks in at about 90 minutes at most. You are rival mining companies and digging under the surface for resources, but everyone can dig from the same set of tunnels, so you have to be sure not to set other players up for big plays.

Interesting mechanism to dig and bomb for point generating tiles.  The art is not at all appealing -- I don't care for the style and it seems a but amateurish.  The whole feel of the game is not very modern.  However, the game play is challenging and you don't see spacial thinking in deck builders too often.  Lots of decisions to make on a turn.  And there are some good card combos, although some of them can be rather awkward which lowers my rating.  The other players also enjoyed it.  Keeper for now.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I'm always curious about deck builders that have a board component and a purpose beyond just buying and cycling/trashing cards. This one doesn't allow you to trash cards so you are just adding better cards to your deck which can be aggravating later in the game when you get a poor draw of starter cards.  However, I found the game interesting, particularly in the placement of the drill tunnels which determine what you acquire and what you potentially set up for your opponents as far as what minerals and such are now accessible to them as it is a common board. Minigoals give you something to pursue and there are also longer term goals in play. Roxley Games always has top notch production levels and the game box does not have much spare space! Another interesting touch is that the four player decks are different outside of the initial 7 starter cards so each faction plays a bit differently.

So far a very fun medium to light strategy game. Don't buy this thinking the deck-building is on par with the likes of dominion or Legendary; it's kind of a minor part of the game.

RATING: 7.85
There's a lot of very cool decisions to be made., the way the deck-building is done is also pretty interesting and innovative and also like that each player has his own deck to upgrade and these decks are little different from each other. It also plays very fast.

The only negative point of the game, and it's not exclusive to this one, is that the game immediately end when someone collects the final artifact. My problem with this is that it causes the situation of not all players having played the same number of Rounds and that bugs me a lot, I don't think it's fair that one, two or three players may play an extra round that another player wasn't allowed to play... in this session me and Nuno played one less Round than Tiago and Olavo, I don't know how many points Nuno didn't make in this last turn, but I would be able to do at least 15 points, in a game where I scored 27 not being able to score 15 in one round is HUGE!!!

A fairly unremarkable and unengaging experience. The game is pure fluff. One game will be very similar to the next, and no matter what you do, you're guaranteed to get points from somewhere. I really don't get the hype behind this one...

Really great deck builder with a spacial reasoning element. Unfortunately it only had enough longevity to get us through 7 plays before we felt we'd seen it all. Recommend you give it a try.

Malgré une mécanique bien connue de deck building "à la Dominion", Super Motherload apporte néanmoins un coup de fraicheur. 

L'interaction entre les joueurs est omniprésente.

D'une durée moyenne, et gérable (elle se fait en fonction du nombre de plateaux), le niveau de difficulté de compréhension est moyen. 

Convient au joueurs comme au non joueurs, qui en fonction, auront des lectures du jeu différents.

Une extension est en préparation

RATING: 8
Not the Trains-killer I was hoping for, but still a really good game.  I love the art style, and the game flows well and quickly.

My biggest issue with the game is that the deck-building aspect is pretty unsatisfying.  Yes, the cards you add to your deck will make big, immediate improvements, but since the artwork on the new cards is the same as the old, it doesn't feel "special" when you upgrade a pilot.

I am always ready to write off a game when it is described as a deck-builder, but this one is an exception. I love the puzzle-like tile-laying. It just look really cool and the asymmetric characters is a nice twist. The art is a bit weird, but not so much to be a deal breaker and on the plus side the icons are really clear. I'm ready to buy this one.

[b]Super Motherload[/b] was received in a trade (6/2/15)

[COLOR=#FF0000]Updated thoughts and rating a few years later (8):[/COLOR]

My fmily and I still really enjoy Super Motherload, but it is no longer our favorite deck builder. It has since been replaced by Clank! and Tyrants of the Underdark. We also tend to play Super Motherload sporadically since repeated play in a short time span causes the game to feel a bit samey. An expansion would certainly help boost the replayability; that said I'd still recommend checking out Super Motherload and it will still remain in our collection.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]My favorite deck builder and that's saying a lot since I don't enjoy most deckbuilders. The real genius of the game is the combination of having a small, but powerful deck you construct combined with vp cards that help craft a unique play experience each game. I'm surprised we haven't played this more, but it comes out about once a month and has been a hit with everyone I've taught it to. My wife also enjoyed this game (my kids taught her) and she's even requested this one which is a rarity. Roxley continues to put out games which combine different mechanics in some unexpected ways, if you don't know much about this game I'd highly recommend checking it out since it works well with new gamers, families and more dedicated gamers.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8/10):[/COLOR]

[i]- The perfect translation of a video game into a board game (I sunk countless hours into I Dig It HD for iPad).
- Excellent family game, it's easy to learn, has a fun theme and plays quick.
- A deck builder I really like for two reasons:
1. You don't have to cycle cards out of your deck, they are all useful.
2. Your deck is small (after an average game you probably have 12 cards in your deck).
- Combos are relatively easy to set up, you can piggy back a bunch of actions together using artifact powers and the one time powers you get from buying cards.
- The addition of the goal cards add a lot variety in how you score points and help kids see different combos and plan ahead.
- *I love the tactile nature of the game, I enjoy seeing the board fill up with tunnels we've dug.

*A note of the upkeep: 
I think some people have a sliding scale of what they will accept in terms of a upkeep to complexity ratio. Some people will have no problem with the constant upkeep in Agricola or Caverna because the game is so heavy, whereas people look at light games and want something quick and almost maintenance free. If you are going to make an exception do it for this game. There is no other way to simulate digging through multiple layers of dirt in a board game without having some amount of fiddliness.[/i]

The box cover's colors are weird to me, but the game is cool-looking and fun.  We tend to like the mental aspect of manipulating pieces to fit in the board like this, Ubongo, Blokus, Princes of Florence, Castles of Mad King Ludwig, etc.  It seems to take a little long, but that would improve with repeated plays...which we may or may not get.

We love the theme.

I tend to not love tactical games as much, but I love dealing with tactical while trying to execute a longer-term strategy.  I need to play this more to see if this is a sweet spot or just OK.

Wow ...I love DBG ...but this appears to be the best IDBG  I have played ...

I call it an Interactive DBG ..because it truly works ...you are deck building with real game play outcomes that interact with a board that really serves a purpose in the game and that purpose adds some real tactical game play and not just something that appears tacked on ...more than just thinning ones deck of cards ...

Stronger interaction than Trains, and other DBG that claim to be more than just deck building ...

Review to come ...

But in a nutshell fantastic game, great components, nice size box ( no empty air) good rules presentation, well supported ...it is the mother-load of IDBGs...

Not really a deckbuilding game in the sense anyone would think of - Motherload couldn't exist without Dominion, but it really reminds me of Goa. You compete for the resources displayed on the central board, limit your opponents' opportunities, work your way down different upgrade tracks, and select from a menu of actions to suit your position. Fantastic theme, too.

Deckbuilding with a board. And with a lot of cool ideas.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Based on one play: A deck builder, sort of. The deck building is minor as you only add a few new cards to your deck through the game. Your cards are used to dig into the ground which gives you money to buy new cards so that you can dig faster, while at the same time trying to earn a few achievements. The turns go fast since you can only have five cards and they mainly just dig, but there is a fair amount of interaction as you all dig on the same board. A very cute game with nice art and theme, putting a little twist on a known mechanic.

Super Motherload [sic] is a combination of a deck-builder and tile-placement game. Players each control a mining consortium trying to extract valuable minerals from an alien planet. Collecting these resources allows the players to purchase new cards that grant more powerful or versatile actions. Instead of the typical deck-building scenario involving drafting from a shared pool of cards, each player plays a faction that has its own drafting pool, with some specializations among factions. The interaction comes from the mining on the main board as well as racing for the public goals. Overall, there were enough interesting ideas that I’d be willing to give this another go. Considering the limited card pool, I’m not sure it will hold up over time as a deck-builder, but the resource management and variable powers do add some variety.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Super Motherload is a super unique game that is going to stay in my collection purely because of how unique of a deck builder it is.  Once you know the rules and understand it's also surprisingly fast in how it works.  But the only reason why this didn't earn an 8 or 9 is because the actual deck building aspects themselves are not that deep due to the lack of cards and variety between the decks.

But I can definitely see an expansion boosting this up to an 8 if they added more boards and more unique decks/customized decks.

After a handful of plays with all different player counts I can say that I REALLY enjoy this one. It plays quick and gives you plenty to think about while playing. I was concerned at first that it would become sort of the same after a few plays but that has proven not true with many more plays. Each game plays out very differently. Achievements give you both short and long term goals to shoot for. I love the purchasing of cards for upgrades. I also enjoy the fact that you can speed up or slow down the pace of the game based on how things are going. Are you ahead on points? Drill like crazy to get that last artifact to trigger the end game. Are you behind on points? Do everything you can to not help drilling towards those artifacts until you purchase some cards. I could go on but so far I am really enjoying this one. Oh and the COMBOS, wow, once you get going you can pull off a really productive turn. EASY to teach, fun to play.

Mindblown by the artwork and gameplay videos. High hopes.

2plays: Not what I expected tbh, still a good game though. It felt a littl dull sometimes even though I fought against the feeling throughout the whole thing. There's a lot to like and there's a lot that I like. But it felt a little boring at times, like just going through the motions and I didn't feel engaged. The deckbuilding aspect is quite good, I really do enjoy how the game handles that. Everytime that you dig and find minerals, you're given those minerals as a sort of currency. With that you will pay your future employees by putting said minerals on top of a card (of 4 different face-up stacks). Each employee has a value and he/she/or it, because some of these candidates just straight up weird and I can't decipher if they're human or.. Something else. Moving on, so yeah the deckbuilding is very good. Some of these folks will go straight to your hand and others to the draw deck, while yielding one time bonuses upon purchase. I like how the board changes based on your cardplay, so it's not a straight up deckbuilder in the traditional sense. The game is quite thematic and you really do feel like you're a team of galactic outcasts drilling for riches. The artwork is very good, although a little cartoony but I suspect that's what they're going for. So why didn't I love it? Well, for one, I didn't like how easy some of the minor achievements were compared to others and how fast they seem to be obtained. I just didn't enjoy the flow of it. And I just felt like a lot of the turns were repetitive and formulaic. My g/f loved it though, so that's a huge plus. Am not done with it yet, a couple of more plays and I'll have a better idea.

Final Verdict: I can see it's a good game but it bores me to tears everytime, and would never play with more than 2. My g/f loves it so I'll play it with her when she requests it. But we agreed that with no more than 2 players, as it becomes too chaotic for my taste.

What a fantastic game!  There is a lot to love in this undersized box.  I love the spatial aspect of placing tunnel tiles to try and maximize your resource generation and setting yourself up for future turns without giving too much to your opponent.  I also love the deckbuilding mechanic which works very well, especially the fact that you can partially pay for cards each round.  The timing surrounding when to unlock cards is a big deal, and great fun!  

I can see this one rising with more plays for sure.  Tentative 8 with room to grow!

I am not a sci-fi girl so if you would have said to me that this game takes place on Mars, I would probably have looked the other way. But thanks to Rahdos runthrough I found this game to acctualy be about digging/mining! :) 
As a child I loved the videogame Diggers for Amiga. 

The theme is awesome and you feel like you are digging for gems. 
Once you know the rules it is farely simple but in the begining it is hard for new players to know what all the symbols mean. This game has no text and is therefor good for people who doesn´t speak english though!

I would classify this as a midweight game.

tl;dr: sci-fi deck building mining game

Games with a space theme always grab my attention. Deck building games are a dime a dozen. Mining games are nothing new. Space themed mining games with artwork by [person=32887][/person] are [thing=63167]also nothing new[/thing]. But that doesn't matter as long as the game is fun.
What is cool about this game is how you have to manage your deck to take into account the different mining techniques. And how every player's cards are different.
All in all this game combines a bunch of familiar mechanisms with some nice artwork and components. The result is an enjoyable game with a good game length and the difference in the decks leads to a good replay value. Which is why I got myself a copy. Nothing too new, but good enough to play a couple of times.

Super Motherload is an boardgame conversion of the computer game of the same title. The game is mechanicaly simple - a  combination of basic deck building and tile placement - but has some strategic potential, especially in a two player game. With more players, it's virtually impossible to plan your moves in advance, because the situation on board changes rapidly with every tile placed. The game also suffers from long downtimes with more players. Nevertheless Super Motherload obviously isn't broken by any means. It is nicely balanced and pretty fun to play. Definitely worth trying.

I like this approach of deckbuilding where it's not your aim to amass tons of cards and then try to thin out the crap you don't want/don't need but where the improvements in your deck are subtly nuanced. Add a game that plays smooth and fast with interesting tactical choices to be made along with a great theme. Highly entertaining, every single of its not so many minutes. 

On a sidenote: It isn't mentioned in the mechanics for this game, but I think you could also add "Variable Player Powers", because the cards you can add are different in each deck. Or at least, the drill powers of some wild pilots are.

In short: It's great.

Update: Unfortunately I've concluded that the game is a little too chaotic with four players. The minor achievements and the tunnel change so radically between your turns that you have very little control. The game is still fantastic with two or three players, though.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 2-3[/b]
With four players, downtime becomes an issue and you really can't plan ahead of time because the board and the achievements can change so much from turn to turn.

Two plays in, can't wait to get this to the table more.  Seriously better than I expected.  We were all fans of Undermining, this is better.

rahdo made me buy it. Thematically was problematic to bring to the table, because my wife doesn't enjoy scifi. Which is why I traded it away for Cyclades.

Simple, original, and refreshing take on deckbuilding, perfectly integrated with a board element.

August '15 - downgraded to 8 for limited replayability. Still a slick piece of design but I find myself reaching for it less and less.

A solid deck-building game that combines puzzle element. I love the artworks by Gavan Brown and the components are remarkable. To be honest I acquired this game with a pretty high price but no regret at all. Definitely a keeper in my collection.

Super Motherload is a very simple deck-builder. There are only 16 cards to buy and each one you purchase accelerates the game while awarding you some victory points. It's a clever way to entice players into following the game's path, although I think once you figure it out, the game becomes a tad one-dimensional as a result.

Fortunately, it plays quick. Usually under and hour and it takes all of five minutes to teach, making it an almost perfect game to throw into any game night. I don't love it, but I'm definitely going to keep it for it's ease of play. Besides, even if it is somewhat predictable, it's still a ton of fun to fire off a big multi-action combo and swipe a bunch of gem stones out from under your opponents!

A cool combination of deck building and spatial puzzle. You can pull off some pretty sweet combos in this game (which may not be that obvious when you first start playing). I really like the tension that builds around the race for fulfilling the short-term and long-term goals. Good game overall, I would gladly play it again.

Already an instant favorite of mine after just one play. Have played it three times now and still think it's an excellent game. Straightforward puzzling strategy on the board meets deck building, and working towards short term and long term goals on the objective cards. The weight of the game is just right but still there are plenty of strategic options to consider. Combine that with great artwork and you've got an instant classic!

Light tile laying deck builder. Teams of mining pod pilots compete on the surface of mars to excavate rare minerals and artifacts. The surface of mars central board displays a stratigraphic geological map with icons that depict ore, obstacles and artifacts. The board reminds me of the video game digger. Play drilling and demolition expert cards to place tunnel tiles on the map and collect tokens of your findings. Use those findings to buy new mining specialist cards for your deck-I like this twist on the basic deckbuilder. Try to collect major and minor achievements along the way. The trick is to mine an area without leaving easy pickings for the next player. Light and amusing. The board is not randomized so it might get samey.

Liking it so far after one play. I like the artwork. I like the tough choices in what you choose to purchase to add to your deck as you likely won't add too many cards to your deck so your choices really need to matter. Overall a very fun game with a cool theme.

Man this was a lot of fun, a deck to board to deck game with objectives! A great first play cant wait to break it out again. First game was 2 player. I do get the feeling though that I would like it less at the max player count, wont know until I try it but I think 3 is the sweet spot for this is two was a lot of fun.

I just stumbled in to this game on BGG one day and I was immediately taken by it. It took the "deck building with a board" style of game and made it appealing to me. It also brought me back to the days of the C64 and games like Dig Dug. The fact that it looked relatively light and played quick was also appealing.

I've played the game now a few times and really enjoy it. I really like how everyone starts off with a different set of cards and their abilities are fairly different and that you're able to improve your draw deck with increasingly more powerful/better faction specific cards as you mine materials. That itself makes the game play differently depending on who you're using. I also like how, as you progress through the game, you see the board evolve and you're left with difficult decisions about what you should be going for as you can set your opponents up for very big turns. Everything works seamlessly together.

I do believe that the game plays best with 2 or 3 people as a 4 player game can get to chaotic. It's also very different from most deck builders as they generally have a slow building of your engine that leads to a race at the end. With Super Motherload the game really is a race right from the start.

All in all, I do enjoy it for what it is. A lighter deck-builder with a nicely integrated board mechanic that make sense. Very fun.

A deck builder without a communal deck, but individual ones paired with a communal resource board. The theme is drilling on Mars... or, let's be honest, it's Dig-Dug the board game. I love so many aspects of this one. The different decks each player gets to build from, the multiple uses of cards, each player has one single card that gives them a special ability when they use that card, the scrolling/double sided boards, video game/space theme. My only complaint is I hate the name. Sounds like a porn.

I liked the video game. This is a solid board adaptation with high quality components. There's little player interaction and game slows while others think about their turns, which is too bad for a game with not a lot of strategy. Unlike the video game the board game doesn't get harder the deeper you dig. There's a feeling of accomplishment when you chain your board play with buying and drawing several cards in one turn.

Played it for the first time. I see this as a 2 player game because there is downtime between turns. I might play it with 3 but definitely not 4.

I say this because i have better 2 player games than this.  I like the deckbuilding aspect and also the action phase but i don't like the extra stuff you can do. This can leave me thinking of the possible options i have in order to maximise my benefits in a single turn.  The effort and reward of these are not to my liking.

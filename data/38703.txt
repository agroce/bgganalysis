RATING: 4
A game with lots of interesting mechanisms [which we'll nick] ... and completely boring [which is fine for Herman Boring from Borehamwood]. Sci-fi was always fantasy's poor cousin and Eve shows how badly you need the public image that comes with a well-known licence.

There are enough spaces on the board to allow four players to expand their empires whilst avoiding combat until they have done so. De rigeur set-up is therefore huddling in a corner. Knizia had a similar problem -- expansion initially, combat ensuing -- in early versions of Tigris, which he solved by reducing board spaces so that players  were tipped into combat immediately. Designer's antidote: play more games.

Empires cohere, so the space theme plays no role. The links between spaces could just as easily be muddy medieval lanes.

Components are high-quality but discriminating between them isn't easy. Heavy box.

Just alright.  Kind of uninteresting play, and the visual organization is terrible- it's very hard to tell things at a quick glance at the board (who owns what, etc).

With that said, it's pretty well balanced, and moves along decently.  It's just not interesting enough for me.

Underrated. Played only once and the game surprised me a lot. The sci-fi theme hides its true wargame structure. Hard decision within a deep mixture of strategy, optimisation and tactic. The "poker chips" appeared as a good production decision. A great surprise! A bit expensive but many deals available at the time I wrote this comment.

Just didn't seem to quite work. If someone starts well it can snowball - developing into a corner and settling large numbers of outposts mixed with constantly cycling region markers. Combat seems to take too long to prepare for to counter this.

Map is not easy to play with - hard to see at a glance who controls what and how close to an outpost you are.

Shame, as there are some nice ideas here.

Very abstracted space combat.  The rules are pretty slick, dare I say, elegent?  Relatively fast playing,but with adjustable game length.  Everyone I've played with alwyas asks for a longer game next time.  A space conquest game for Eurobitches.

Provisional rating - I need to play it more.

I'm struggling to write a comment on this - it's such a strange beast. I haven't played EVE the computer game, so I don't know how this matches up (not a lot I suspect). The game uses poker chips and this works well for the game, but I suspect many players would want space ships. I like them. I think this is rather under-rated here on the geek.

Calendar mechanic is great - you can manipulate when you do stuff in the year. And the combat starts off looking obvious (take red dice) but once you have some cards in play it gets rather more interesting.

Much better if you play that the owners chips go at the top and agents underneath!

I prefer playing a long game, with the variable end condition.

This is the most gorgeous boardgame I've ever seen. In scope and length I think it matches Shogun pretty much. The gameplay captures some of the MMO:s nicer themes e.g. long term planning and resource allocation. Sadly there is no trading. The factions are identical except for labels and colors which is also rather unfortunate. I guess that on a galactic scale they can be assumed to not differ greatly but still it removes some of the flavour I think. Cards are used to spice up gameplay. I know it sounds cliché but the basic mechanic is simple but with strategic depth. The rules require a thorough reading once or twice but then you should be good to go. I will get back on replayability when I've been through a couple of more games.

To sum up: A very good (and pretty) boardgame that captures some of key elements of the EVE universe. The designers have chosen to make a good game rather than try to cram every little detail from the MMO in. This is mostly a good thing of which I approve, however I miss trading. But not to much...

I've owned this game for four years now and I've managed to score only one play even though in my gaming group we quite often give new chances to games that have failed to impress on the first few plays.

Why? The game simply is so boring. It's not that it is completely broken (just a bit) but that it is so bland in everything that it does. Also, there are so many other games that do the same thing way better, so why bother with this one?

Pros:
- Box art. I bought the game for it's box art and well.. The brand sold me too (I've never played the pc game).

Cons:
- The battle die. They just don't work as they are not balanced at all. The 'attack' die is so much more better than the other dies that we can't understand why anyone would use anything else.
- The gloss of the game board. It's like a woman with way too much makeup on and you try and struggle to see what kind of monster lives under there.
- The game chips and small figures. These are about as uninspirational space themed figures as there can be. It's like a steam roller drove over your game components but you still try to play with them while that geeky boy next door over has a brand spanking new set of Twilight Imperium 3rd ed.
- Lacks original ideas.

I play EVE so was very interested in this when I heard of it.  I got it for my birthday and have managed a couple of games and really enjoyed them both.  It's pretty abstracted which knocks out some of the theme (which is a shame as I love Sci-Fi themes and, as I said, I actually play EVE.)  However that aside it's a very good game.  The components are great and the map could be used to bludgeon a rhino to death with!  I love the combat mechanics and the calendar mechanic and just the way the whole thing fits together.  I'm glad that I got this one and can't wait to get some more plays in.

RATING: 7
This game played better than I expected it to; it was challenging, I love the calendar mechanism and it works. 

There are a few cons; the game needs to be played for a minimum amount of time or else it doesn't develop, the endgame seems to grind to a halt and worst of all, there can be a significant swing in the "political landscape" (completely by chance).

That last part can be mitigated by players trying to ensure they hold on to the most valuable systems, and perhaps planning around knowledge of what is in each pile; but if a player instigates a strong defence from the start of the game, then it's just a matter of whether or not his cards come up.

For now, I give it a 7; this could go up or down, but I sense given the game's length it might be some time before it gets another outing.

RATING: 6
Aside from being complex, horribly tedious and unbelievably luck driven... I think Eve is the game that had so much potential but couldn't quite seal the deal. It's a fun take on hold and defend but really the game is for people who probably enjoy the online genre more so than board gamers. Eve is when you mash up risk, and starcraft. It's complicated and should only be played with someone who already knows the rules and has a good command of your first language. Once you grasp this game though, watchout! It's filled with strategy, interesting concepts that really don't exist in other games (like the combat system) but lags deeply in the victory conditions.

Plus: Very nicely created, the game is stunning! Awesome combat concepts.
Minus: Stock up on drinks, food, and cancel your plans for tomorrow. This game can and will go on forever.

I don't know anything about Eve, the MMORPG, but it doesn't matter. Everything about this game screams "Epic!" There are no starship miniatures, like TI or Galactic Emperor. Units are represented by poker chips, where enemy units can stack to designate agents, sort of like Conquest of Pangea. Regions of space are connected by links, sort of like warp lines from Imperium. The most fascinating mechanism I have seen so far is the Calendar. Players have three different actions: development, production, and logistics, that they schedule on the calendar, in a staggered fashion. However, the players can use resources to ramp up or ramp down the timing (or frequency), and the amount of units/actions procured. For example, if I am willing to wait six months instead of two, I can create eight units, instead of two during production. The risk is, in the meanwhile, my empire could be destroyed by other players taking more actions in the interim. The schedules of all the players actions can be seen at a glance on the calendar. Because of this, the game has an epic feel. Galactic expansion is painfully slow, and it is like steering a barge when trying to react to something happening on the other side of one's empire, so one must plan several turns in advance, while taking into account everyone else's development/production/logistics schedule. The battle mechanism is neat as well, where players secretly pick the combination of attack, shield, and tactics dice, in an attempt to thwart the opponent. The victory conditions can adjusted to shorten/lengthen playing time, which is approximately 2 to 3 hours for the "normal" game.

A very detailed combat space game. My first impression reminded me of an Axis and Allies -like game but set spanning a galaxy. The game is driven by building up units, and attacking other players until a victory condition is met. The game draws from the artwork and background of the EVE online MMORPG, but does not have the same play experience. 

I enjoy this game a lot, and I found it to be very fun, although time-intensive. A light game will take at least 2 hours, and plan on at least an hour to get a hang of the play system. There is a two-player variant that cuts the board down to half the size, making encounters happen quicker and less confusion with the multiple locations of conquest.

Fairly interesting game to be honest. Definitely need to get it to the table again some time. But the rules and mechanics seem to be a little convoluted.

I feel like there should be more conflict than there is, and the way in which you acquire political territories is mostly random...but there is still something to like here...

The components help make this package above average.

EVE: Conquests is an epic game of space conquest that I managed to win without once participating in a battle. Some nice ideas, but it didn't seem particularly well balanced. It was far too easy to bump your capacities up to maximum and it seemed hard to catch up if you missed out on early rapid expansion.

A game with lots of interesting mechanisms - I love the combat system, the scoring system, the time track, the cards...

However - the actual board play is far too abstract (almost forgivable), extremely unbalanced (borderline forgivable), and completely and utterly boring (unforgivable).

One to avoid.

This is a fun four player game.  The key is choosing a position that will allow you to get two outposts on turn one and setting up for a defensive position.  Very critical.  Getting points in the beginning not a priority in the first year.  Definitely getting them in the second year.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Let me say first that the production value is fantastic, very thick heavy game board, great components although at first I didn't like the poker chips but they work perfectly for this game and great graphics. Played with 4, 3 and 2 all great games. On top of it all very well designed. I honestly wanted to give this game a 9 even from the first play since everyone really liked it but the random placement of the region markers, which are what actually allow you to get victory points causes some inbalance to the game. You can really spread out your forces over the board but if you are not near any of the region markers you'll have issues getting victory conditions. Watch out for those players who set up on the outer regions they get outposts quickly which in turn provides resources, more units and more actions. Our final score was 16, 11, 5 and 2 victory points, so not a very close game. Hopefully the  next play will balance out a bit better since we'll know the rules. The issue with the region markers and victory points is balance with the fact that if you attack an opponents region with an outpost and you win the combat and remove it you can take one of their region markers that matches the colour of the region. This way if someone is getting lucky with having the region markers showing up on most of his control regions you can decrease their victory points so they don't run away with a quick win.

I like this game well enough.  I'd really give it a 7, but due to my fondness for the genre, I pull it back to a 6.  It's fun and replayable--the directions are a bit awkward but I try not to let directions skew the game itself (though it is part of the whole package--and, in this case, a rather pricey one).  The minis are nice, and the chips are...round.  Everything fits in the box pretty well--I felt a little like "Now what?" when I had 2 of each resource, but couldn't upgrade my turns anymore.  Also felt a bit confused why, when I took a card labelled "Development", it clearly was for use in a Logistics turn.  *SHRUG* I still enjoyed it well enough, and though it's not TI3, it will also not send people who don't have eight hours to play a space opera running from the room when I pull it out.  I also think it's more approachable for younger players and/or those not as keen on hardcore SciFi epic play.

Too long for it's game mechanic.  Even a short game takes too long for what players have to do.

Also, combat is too evenly matched.  In an entire (3hr; 4 person) game only 5 systems changed hands. (and not for a lack of trying)

Finally, the mechanic for determining which systems are worth points throughout the game is not balanced.  In the game we played, these systems were all on one side of the board.  Players on the other side spent the whole game doing nothing.

The production value of Eve Conquests is massive like the box itself. Everything seems really well thought through, from the thick and beutiful game board to the space station pieces. And the artwork on the cards is just amazing! The box is a little pricey compared to many games, but I felt like I was really getting my money´s worth. But looking good isn´t enough, so on to the gameplay...

I´ve played this game 5 times now, plus one test game, and so far I am impressed with the mechanics. As far as strategy goes, it feels like I´m still just scratching the surface. It plays well and be warned that it really cooks your brain. Warning - If you want a game of luck, this isn´t it! I play with reasonably serious gamers and have won 2 times out of five and if there´s anything we agree on, that is it :)

The game is innovative. First I mention the action wheel. It shows the production cycle over the course of a full year and is the key element in planning ahead. I can see what the opponents will be doing all the time, allowing me to guess their plans. Working the action wheel constantly in my mind is taxing but also a key to winning.

Second is the layout of the game board itself. I´ve seen abstract game tables before, but the scale of this one really blew my mind. The solar systems, light years apart, are connected with jump lines and color coded based on their resource value and difficulty to secure - and hence the size of the table, it´s simply huge. Interlaced with that is the background color of the gameboard. It is like interstellar gas or dust clouds and we were pretty impressed when we realized that the background color is used as visual cue in the game and not just decor. It is like the rest of the game - Multi-layered and multi-faceted. The game always plays different. Objectives vary and out of the five times we´ve done we´ve had two where late bloomers took over in the endgame after the stronger factions had torn each other down, two even games and one game where I grabbed the lead around mid-game and withstood the other players ganging up on me when they realized what I was doing. 

Thirdly, the action starts immediately. I really like that the game starts cooking even before I lay down the very first piece. It feels like every single decision I take is crucial and that maintains excitement throughout. Losing ground early on feels pretty brutal I must say, and some people may not like that. But me and my players agree that as long as everyone goes for the leader and form alliances while it remains to your benefiteveryone enjoys a potential comeback. Teaming up with your main enemy is often necessary.

Next the dice combinations that you make in secret before combat are a clever mechanism as well. At first it felt like stacking just one type of dice was the way to go, but that has proven to be absolutely not the case. Even though you´re pretty sure what the opponent will do, not being sure until the dice are revealed is exciting in itself. Seeing what the opponenent chooses is also revealing of his strategy, so it´s a show-and-tell situation. I think it´s very cool.

There are more features, like the ongoing production cycles and the cards but this is getting pretty long :)

On the downside, the rulebook is damn dark, as if molded out of space itself and as a result, it´s pretty heavy to page through. But on the other hand it isn´t too big and it is well written. We didn´t have any special problems getting started at least - We did one test game as usual before really getting started and it took around 90 minutes. Another potential negative is that the game is made for competitive thinkers, I don´t see it being played casually. It is demanding. Personally I think that´s great, but for it will probably be too taxing for a certain type of gamer.

Overall it is beutiful, epic game that rewards player politics and the ability to think ahead. A thinker´s game and I rate it as such with the best.

Definately a cool game to play.  The rules are a bit convoluted in the instruction manual.  And I use a few house rules just to make things easier to play.  I hope to do a quick reference for the instructions at some point to make things a bit clearer and more concise. 

The scoring system of claiming systems is a bit wierd.  But it makes for intersting strategic situations. 

The quality of the pieces and board are pretty nice.  My only complaint is the production/logistics/development cards seem to be printed on too light of a card stock.  They feel really flimsy.  And finding the rings indicating systems on the political landscape can be a bit hard to see.  

All in all its definately a good game once you clear through the muddy instruction manual.  Definately a game of strategy though.

I think someone else had it right when they said that for this game, the total is less than the sum of the parts.  Everything works well, and there are even some outstanding parts (like the turn mechanism), but the game is kind of flat.  

The strategy seems to be - grab as much territory as you can, and then hope that the point cards you need show in your territory.  It's hard to attack too much, as it often takes two logistics turns to attack - one to get in position, and one to attack.  In the meantime, the other guy gets to refortify, move, etc.

Too long. You can be out after 30 minutes and be forced to play another 2-3 hours.

Bought a second hand copy as I played EVE for about 6 years and always wanted to play this game. My experience was marred by the fact that I was playing with people who had little interest in the New Eden experience. Having said that I did enjoy the gameplay and liked the strategy element of planning you type of action you take and what order they are resolved in. It can make the end game a very interesting strategic affair.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Like the components, like battling on a "graph" and the calender schedule mechanic. Bit slow to build up an attack, rather clunky in that respect, can overpopulate with outposts really easily so that allocation of resources isn't ever tight, but too many outposts leave you open to attack. Yet to play other than solo so not the best idea if this would make for an enjoyable evening. Still, 7 for the concept.

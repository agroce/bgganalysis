Guilford Courthouse:  It is historically accurate.  I'm just not sure how the Americans made such a fight out of it.  Not all battles translate into good games and this seems to be one of them.  It seems very lopsided for the British.  

Eutaw Springs: I enjoyed this one more.  I love how the British have to defend the perimeter or lose AM.  You could "game" this to a draw pretty easily, but if you try to stay within the spirit of the rules, it makes for a very historically accurate battle.  I really like the special rules for the foraging party as well as the looting rules, which can make the American player every bit as frustrated as Nathaniel Greene.

Low counter density makes for a relatively fast game (90-120 minutes), which in some ways makes it more enjoyable than its predecessors, but since both battles are lopsided, the tension is not there.  However, if you are going to buy a bunch of games in the GMT [family=54][/family] series, start here because the low counter density makes it easier to pick up on the mechanics.

GMTs American Revolution Series comes close to what I like in my tactical games. Beautiful components, larger hexes, low counter density (more manoeuvrability), clever game mechanics and tactical choices to make.

However it falls short:
* I don't like d10s (what is wrong with 2 d6s?)
* Tactical Matrix doesn't make much sense and is time consuming
* Too widespread combat results

Still it feels like a light, clean, clear and fresh game system.

I really like the Series. Feel - in my point of view - as AmRev Battle Games shoul feel. I almost smell the powder and see the Militia-Boys run!

This two battles are good beginners to learn the rules and the system.
Really fun stuff. 

If you play Guliford Courthouse, you should not use the momentum chits to reroll die, because this gives the British a VERY powerful mechanic and turns to a snowball effect that limits fun a lot. The British troops do not need help anyway.

Don't like the Tactics Chits as well, which slow the game significant without adding anything but little (very little) historical chrome.

ideal game for me as I have limited time and space to play. This sets up very quickly due to the low unit count and also plays likewise. The rules are fairly traditional with nice chrome and an excellent map.

My first foray into the Revolutionary War series from GMT--picked it up on sale from their site along with Von Manstein's Backhand Blow and Zero.  I've enjoyed it so far, although I haven't played with the advanced rules on momentum yet.  After this one, I've got some interest in the rest of the series, although the $45-50 range is probably a little more than I'm willing to pay for these games.  I'd definitely consider them if another sale came along, however.

RATING: 7.5
Learned the system by playing Eutaw Springs scenario a couple times. I love the counter density and the wonderful historic feel to these American Revolution games. The rules are relatively simple, but still provide lots of interesting decisions. I greatly appreciate the several pages of historical narrative in each rulebook, which helps to pique my interest in the battes.

The part of the game that just really makes it "work" is the Tactic Chit Matrix. Before each battle, players get to secretly choose from among up to 8 different tactics for their troops to use, ranging from "Withdraw" to "Commit Reserve" to "Flanking Maneuver". The presence of leaders and an open flank will make all the options be available. (No leader and you can't do some of the more aggressive maneuvers.) The result is a die roll modifier, depending on the interaction of the tactics used by each side. 

Another great feature of the system is the "Momentum" counters. A decisive win will net you a chit that can be used to force a reroll later in the contest. But Momentum cuts both ways.

If I didn't have a natural interest in this era, I'm sure my enjoyment of the games would be less...but I think they are colorful and fun battles. Its also nice that the scenarios are limited to something that is very realistic to play through to completion in an evening. I'm looking forward to trying other titles in the series.

My first impressions from several games. This is a very nice, easy to learn game system. Both scenarios (Guilford Courthouse and Eutaw Springs) are quick and fun to play. I first thought the tactics chit system would be too gimicky but it works really well with this system (kind of keeps you on the edge of your seat until they are revealed). Very well done. I will be looking into the other games in this series (Brandywine, Saratoga, Savannah, and Monmouth).

Very clean and nice system for the subject and the period. Scenarios are small and simple but with some nice historical flavour...
Guilford battle seems straightforward: the English with a strong army will try to advance to the courthouse while the Americans with more troops, but of very low quality, will try to stop them... A very defensive game for the Americans trying to delay things as much as possible... Nice little introduction scenario with some sudelties that can only be seen after few games played.

Eutaw Springs is less interesting and very striagth forward. Goog enough to learn the rules.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Two games in one. Guilford Courthouse strongly favors the British, but it's still fun to play the Americans and throw your weak militia at the redcoats in a desperate attempt to delay. The terrain restricts maneuver severely, much like Saratoga.

Eutaw Springs is more upfront, in your face fighting, due to the nature of the terrain- the Americans' main approach to the British camp is more or less limited to the main road running down the middle of the map, although opportunities for flanking maneuvers do exist. I would have liked Eutaw Springs more were it not for the looting rules; a cautious player will find "gamey" ways to minimize their impact, and they felt a bit contrived to me. But I still enjoy it, and play it from time to time. Eutaw Springs is the fastest playing game in the series to date.

Overall, a fun system that is only moderately complex, and quickly becomes second nature. There are a lot of DRMs which are annoying at first, but with time even they become second nature. 

Within a month of purchasing this game, we played it about five times. That says a lot, I think. The average game can be played in only 2 or 3 hours, which helps to ensure a lot more replays. The large 5/8" counters and excellent map artwork are a joy, and further help to draw new wargamers into the hobby.

GMT had this on sale as part of their 3 for $45 (I don't know if it's still available), and at only $15 this is a great buy. I can't quite recommend it as an "intro" game since the rules are upper-low to low-mid complexity, but with the right teacher they are pretty quick and easy to pick up. I've used this (or Saratoga) to introduce two newbies to wargaming, and it went very well, despite all the DRMs. :-)

I would probably rate Guiford a 7.5/10 as a game, and Eutaw Springs a 7/10. But the fact that you get both in one well designed, attractive package makes me bump my overall rating up to an 8.

A real player on little known American Revolutionary War battles--these (includes Eutaw Springs as well) take place during Greene's Southern Campaign.  Definitely design for effect, which turns off those with a bent for miniatures-like treatments (such as we see in CoA's Battles of the Age of Reason (BAR) series).  Can't stop playing these--lots of color, excitement, tension!

I like the American Revolution system very much.  It's intuitive, well designed and fun to play.  My concern is that it is near impossible to achieve a decisive victory for either side in the Guilford battle, and because of the morale rules, that it seems very easy to achieve a british sybstantial victory through morale depletion.  Once the american is the 5-10 morale range, nothing improves from that point on and the slow descent only accelerates.  We enjoyed the game enough to try it again; we will definitely play the Euthaw springs scenario.  Good game.

Initial rating after one play of the Guilford campaign. The American Revolution series has a nice, clean, reasonably easy living rules set. The individual games then have their own brief rule extensions which add just a touch more chrome/fiddlyness than I like. I just ignore those bits which I don't think are worth the effort to remember.

I don't consider myself a grognard, and I'm enjoying Guilford very much. I love the low counter density. I'm looking forward to trying the Eutaw Springs map. More comments later.

The Guilford Battle scenario is be a good balanced game (using the draw as a US win rule change) but the big scenario is allfully tough for the US.

Uses the basic Am Rev system, simple but full of flavor. It does favor high morale units though, so those militia guys are little more than speed bumps.

I don't like Eutaw

RATING: 7
*This is based on the Eutaw Springs scenario only* Very clean system, and this one played very quickly. We figured that the best British strategy was pull back through the camp ASAP to try to get the Americans looting. Attempts by the British to defend further forward tended to get stomped on. Little in the way of command and control limitations, but the morale track gives you a nice picture of your army disintegrating before your eyes. For my side anyway...... :)

My first brush with this series & I liked it enough to grab a few of the other titles.
There is no sledgehammer offence but, rather, a lot of hit and run attacks, retreats & advances and ever so careful positioning of units to foul up retreat routes.  The low counter density makes every unit, no matter their strength, a precious commodity.  
The most striking thing I found in playing this and the smaller extra game, Eutaw Springs, is that the attacking side is battling the clock as much as his opponent, as there is much ground to cover and not a lot of time to do it.

Next time I will definitely play a defense in depth. Had a 2nd play today ... Putting this one back on the shelf.

These three ARW games are all professional, Brandywine is probably the best.  I would like to give them all 9s or 10s based on the graphics and the OOB, but the game engine itself is just a little off for my tastes.  The combat matrix is almost just another die roll, without adding much narrative or strategy to the game, it is actually kind of annoying.  The turn flip flops hinder the design too imo, rather inelegant.  All of the game suffer from what I call the 1vp syndrome...games will often ride on a single step loss on the last turn.

RATING: 5
Well, it is a fun experience.  However, it takes awhile to get used to the rules.  They are typical GMT fair but maybe not worth it.  Ted and I enjoyed our first go at it but it definitely was a learning game.

Downgraded March 2011: I just do not feel that this game or the series gives enough historical flavor.  I now played Eutaw Springs and felt like it was too gamey and not simulationy enough.  Also, do NOT buy this for full price.  It is NOT worth it.  All of the scenarios should be combined into one game and cost about $70.  

I will still try it.  I do not feel like I have given it the good old college try, but it is trying my patience.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Guilford is certainly a game with low counter density. The British have only around 14 units in play. This makes it a game that is very easy to manage. The rules are low complexity too, and the scenario booklet with exclusive rules is only several pages long. Set up is extremely quick and all 13 turns can be played through in 2-3 hours. Eutaw Springs is perhaps more interesting, again low density, but the forces are fairly evenly matched. Guilford is unkind to the Americans. Much prefer to play both on CB - the constant modifiers and chit pulling gets too repetative.

Battles of the Amer Rev is not a series I'd recommend unless you're pretty committed to playing all the titles. Too many modifications and advanced rules to committ to memory for a one off game - it can get fiddly and repetative. But as a series, it's good fun at a complexity similar to C&C. This one is a good place to start; it's inexpensive and not overly strategic.

The game components are nice, but there is not a lot there.  The fact that the games come one or two battles to a box is a major disadvantage to DG R&R.

And does game play offer a major improvement over what I didn't like about R&R?  Unfortunately at this point I'd have to say no.  Like the DG offerings, units in the line are free to just march off across the enemies front and attack a flank, the rules are slightly fiddley for a simple game, and there just isn't much to think about.  Game play is primarily about factor counting and then luck before skill takes a distant 3rd spot.

Edit: Downgrading rating for this game because of poor scenario design of the Eutaw game.  Word on CSW is Eutaw is "finely balanced."  IMO that is more a function of small game with equally sized forces than any achievement of the designer.  In fact i would rate the Eutaw scenario as poorly designed becase there are a number of scenario specific rules that do not come into play unless the British players plays a passive defensive game which is what the designer probably intended.

I still prefer Redcoats & Rebels, which is much more bang for the buck. Makes me think Miklos must be some kind of business genius--$55 for Germantown vs. $65 for a box stuffed with Commands & Colors: Ancients or a Musket & Pike title layered in mapsheets and countersheets? I'd like to hire him to negotiate a contract for me sometime. 

A bit too simple for me--no facing, lacking terrain effects, etc. In fact, the latter makes it impossible to replicate Guilford as actually fought. Since woods offer no benefit to those within them, there is no incentive to line up in them as the original Continental militias did. (True, they do slow movement down, but this is offset partially by there being no ZOCs exerted by defenders in woods hexes). 

Instead, lining up at the stream in a more forward position makes much more sense, given the stream offers a modifier. Even with this strategy, though, inflicting the kind of casualties the British suffered is near impossible. So much for simulation value.

Still, the game is decent fun and may make a good intro wargame system for a person new to the hobby, although a more balanced series entrant might be more ideal, or maybe Eutaw Springs.

Played Guilford twice, won as British and held Brits to a marginal victory as Americans. Played Americans at Eutaw, rather wantonly, and lost when artillery blew up General Greene.

I'm no longer on the no-terrain-effect fence about these. They have nice touches and look great, but the whole affair comes off as dismal. In this one, you seem to build up some big stacks and go around hunting for good match-ups. Lines or anything resembling command and control are almost irrelevant.

Two interesting battles, a fun game, and great components. I love the tactics chits, which help me get over my loathing for CRTs. Neither battle is particularly balanced, but I suppose you could give the Americans some momentum chits if that matters to you.

RATING: 7
Based on one face to face play of Eutaw and a couple of solitaire plays of Guliford, I appreciate the simplicity of the system, but it still leaves some important decisions to the player. I also like the fact that once you learn the system, you know how to play all 5 games in the series. Some of the terrain rules were quirky--the woods and orchards hexes don't really provide much of a defensive benefit and fences also do not effect combat, but these are minor issues. I was also leery of the tactics chits, but they work in this system since there aren't many rules to remember.The strenghts and weaknesses of the different units don't get glossed over. Militia, state troops, Continentals, and British Regulars all have different capabilities and part of the fun for me is seeing these differences play out in the game.I have not played the other games in the series, but after Guilford I feel comfortable moving on to the larger battles.

Nice, quick playing game with a surprising amount of nuance and depth. I particularly like the Army Morale and Momentum rules, which make this a cut above older stuff like SPI's "Blue & Gray" series.

See Brandywine for my comments on the system.

The Guilford & Eutaw Spring scenarios are a little less interesting IMHO as the options are more restricted.

Excellent entry point into the system. Plays reasonably fast. Wished it didn't use the matrix chits as they aren't realistic at this scale.

Simple game to learn and play, as is the entire series so far. Low counter density makes for a quick set-up and short playing times. The rules lack some clarity, but overall they are functional.

Somehow I just didn't like this one compared to the one done by GDW in 1978. This version covers a larger area than the actual battlefield and therefore the battle doesn't necessarily have to occur where it did historically. Not all the battles of the Revolution fit into this 'system' and perhaps this is one of them. It's not a 'bad' game, but one is heavily influenced by 'what came before' and personally I prefer the GDW title better.

My first experience with this system. Only played solo to date but very much enjoy the game. Solid design... challenging - love the combat chit system - adds a nice layer to the combat sequences.

Pretty good simulation of the AmRev battle, good game too, extra point for the bonus Eutaw Springs game.

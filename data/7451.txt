The best word game I ever played, and one of the best two player game. Almost everything in this game works perfectly: play fast or your opponent may find something before you do; pay attention when it is not your turn since a Jarnac is the best way to win a lot of points quickly; play until the end since with one or two Jarnac you can turn a losing game into a win. Brilliant.

Terrifying and demoralizing word game. "Jarnac" must be Klingon for, "You missed a word, fuckwit!" 

Made from Anagram tiles.

Keep adding letters to your tableau to form new anagrams. If opponent spots any after you pass he steals. Letter distribution needs more vowels (is it based on french?), as game bogs down once rows get large. Rules seem sound, so will experiment with different letter distributions. [gameid=9556] is a more "free form" anagram alternative that is a better imho.

The best word game you've never heard of. Except that you're reading this, so you've heard of it.

Unlike Scrabble, it plays quickly. Unlike Boggle, it doesn't overly reward those who are fastest at scribbling 3-letter words.

Bought for the tiles. Gave both copies away to a friend when he couldn't find his after moving. They're put to better use there I think!

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Enjoyed this as a team game where one team makes words until they run out of tiles or can't figure out another word. At that point, the other team has a quick moment to try and steal words if they can extend the word.

Closer to Foil than to Scrabble, Jarnac pits two players or groups against each other to build or improve and score words on their respective boards using letters from their hands, all of it open for everyone to see. If the opponent spots any better way to use the letters, they will steal the full words and leftover letters needed for this improved combination and then add their new word to their own board.

Jarnac is quick, relatively luck-dependant (the letters don't score according to their frequency or position in the word so that a hand with many vowels or consonants can be hard to manage) and extremely unforgiving: for each steal one player loses an amount of points while the opponent gets yet a bigger one, so that one error can be utterly fatal. It can be said as well that it rewards both great vocabulary and a knack for anagrams (words can be reassembled changing the order of the letters), as many other word games. Nevertheless, there is one feature of Jarnac that is truly unique: each time a word is built or improved a letter is collected on the hand, so that the ideal words to use are those with lots of derivatives, which have to be built as slowly as possible.

Letter games are clearly not my cup of tea but this must be the best in the "serious" category (and "in extremis" in the fun category)

Based on one play: Much simpler and less long then Scrabble. You make words with your open letters and pass when you can no longer make a new word or add to an existing one. But if you miss something the other player can steal your words. It was ok to pass the time, but not really a fan of word games.

It's a multiplayer solitaire word game done well. Players ensure that the game moves quickly. Every time you create a word, you take another tile and take an extra turn. If you can't create a new word, you pass. However, if you take too long before you pass, your opponent has a better chance to find a new word that you missed -- and can steal that word! 

This is the game you should play if you have Bananagrams and only have two players. Both games use 144 tiles. The Jarnac boards themselves are not necessary. However, I own the Blackrock Editions version that comes with plastic player mats in which tiles stay in place; these boards make this game a joy to play.

Other pluses:
* No need for paper and pencil to write down scores throughout the game (which seems like a requirement for most word games)
* You can play the game sitting next to your opponent rather than opposite

Scrabble fans should probably stay away; there isn't much for long term strategy,

A brain-burning word game, as you build words on your own mat and try to steal your opponents' letters by catching words they've missed. So far, I'm pretty bad at it, but it's still enjoyable.

Interesting word game, although I imagine very prone to AP if played face to face? Although maybe not, since both players are actively looking for new word combos all the time.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Start with a bunch of letters. On your turn, use your letters to make new words (3+ letters long) or add to existing words, rearranging letters as you like. Each word allows you to draw an extra letter. Keep playing until you can't find any more words = pass. Other player can call "JARNAC" if they see something you missed; if so, they steal that word from you! Then, they take a normal turn.

The game ends when one player has 8 words. Players score VP for each word = length squared. Most VP wins!

RATING: 8
A two-player game that compels you to pay attention to your opponent's turn and to move quickly on your own turn to give your opponent less time to study your words. Hence, a word game that actually keeps moving.

It's all about rearranging and adding to existing words. Shout "Jarnac" immediately after your opponent ends his turn, if you can see how he could have redeveloped one of his existing words, with some of his unused tiles, to form a more valuable word.

If you own Scrabble and you've never played Jarnac, go get the rules on the Net and use Scrabble components, like I do. Jarnac is a much more active game, it's got lot of tension and it's fast paced. Try it once and I'm pretty sure that you'll never go back to your old flat Scrabble...

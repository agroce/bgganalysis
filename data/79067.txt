RATING: 5
This is the only dedicated drinking game in my collection. I'm convinced that this is where the game really shines. 
Lose X voice = drink X fingers. 
Gain X voice = nominate someone to drink X fingers. 
Give everyone a new Vexed card at the start of each round. 
Just make sure you keep the drinks well out of the way of the Hexen Stix...

Played this for the first time last evening and we could all tell it will be a go-to staple of our gaming nights.  Just flat out fun.  There is something to be said for simplicity mixed with a high dose of malice.  The variants are superb, as well.  Hope Smirk and Dagger releases some add-in card packs in the future.

Fast game that is fun with the right crowd as curses and hexes get thrown around the table until someone gets hit by it and loses somes points while the hexer gains them. 1 Play.

A lot of people hate on this game.  Saying it's basically "Hot Potato" ...well, yes, it is.  However, it is a super fun game and a great, quick one to just open up and start with. Easy to learn and the expansions make it even more chaotic.

●Rule is super simple, I believe anyone could actually invent this kind of game. Game was really fun.
●You're basically need to use the limited cards in your hands to pass the hex token away from you. The player who do not have any cards or don't have cards that make him pass the hex, will be hexed.
●Game has a lot of interaction and suitable for party.
●There are symbol on the cards but none actually mean anything.
●Also, it's kinda hard to memorize the usage of the card (except a few) as there are too many kinds and sometime the text is kind of hard to understand. It would be cool if they can make it more simple, really.
●The stone to mark the value  of your voice is kinda big. They can either print the voice values a little bigger or just reduce the size of the stone.

Components:
●Cards were made of good quality, just like any other game.
●Stix were made from wooden.
●Token were made from normal card stock.

[13 plays] I love this game semiobsessively. Whenever I'm disappointed that my gaming buddies didn't appreciate some game that I'm crazy about, I remind myself that they all loved Hex Hex.  I can take the expansions or leave them alone; Hexxen Stix adds a dangerous dexterity element and Vexed makes things a little more party-gamish. I actually enjoy both but don't find either essential.

It's a 'take that!' style of game where you're deflecting hexes towards your other friends, there's an optional dexterity element to the game which my group chooses not to play with. It's pretty fun most of the time but there are certain card combos in the game that can turn it into a rage worthy experience.

I love the idea of this game. But since text is in english, the game drags a little while players read every single card and decide what to do. I have to translate the cards and try this game again

Full of spite and laughs, Hex Hex allows for a great bit of light (though dark-spirited) fun between friends. To be clear: It is not a heavy tactical game. While strategies can be formed, the play is mercurial enough to dissolve most long-term plans. Perhaps the most enjoyable mechanic is the ability for the winner to create an additional rule (which must apply fairly to all players) for the next game. Many memories can be formed with these rules, as some will be so effective in their ridiculous one just can't help but enjoy them.

(Initial comment after one game)
Thought I'd enjoy this more than I did. Seems like a game that wants to be played quickly with minimal fiddliness or downtime, but kept getting bogged down as soon as hexes started splitting and multiplying, and several cards had to be resolved simultaneously - with much resulting ambiguity about how various cards interacted. Eventually one of the last rounds got especially complicated and my opponents lost patience and gave up before finishing the game.

I'm willing to give it another chance or two as maybe this was just part of a learning curve, but I can't see this taking off as a casual party game as I'd hoped.

(Update after two more games)
Pleased I didn't give up on this - with the right group it's very entertaining. It can definitely get messily chaotic and complicated, but there's fun to be had from untangling what each hex does to whom. My rating has gone up from 5 to 7, but it does have to be the right sort of group - light-hearted gamers in the mood for chaos.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Solid game, but the issue with this game is that it's too long, and there's too much to teach for new players for such a simple game.

If they made a second edition which streamlined the rules/gameplay and shortened the length then it would be much better

Combining the best cards from HexHex and HexHexNext (and removing most of the more confusing cards).  It plays well in a streamlined fashion.   Haven't had a chance to play the HexenStix and Vexed variants yet.  Remains one of my favorite "take-that" style of games.

RATING: 7
Crazy, random, take-that fun. But I've found that casual players find it too confusing. You really need to read and understand all the cards and pay attention to the game.

High replayability with very simple rules. More fun than any game I have played in a long time. Several of the card mechanics clash with one another, leaving players guessing at the correct way to resolve them. While a bit fiddly with additional hex tokens, it is worth the effort to keep track of long turns. The inclusion of the hexen sticks is a nice twist. Players who favor stratic over purely tactical games might feel like rolling a D6 to determine the winner would be a better use of time. But if you are looking for a game that is simple to have laughs with friends then this is a must have for your game stash. 

TLDR: Super Fun game. Flaws and all the comradery it fosters is priceless.

I'm down with a lot of the things this game does, especially as a party game (for which you can excuse some of the ambiguous rules, etc).  That doesn't excuse some of the bad design elements (punish players for making reasonable decisions, disproportionate rewards assigned at random, runaway leaders/losers causing loss of interest for half the table, etc).

You may say "that's the point!", to which I say that random wackiness may be the point, but it ceases to be a very good point when half the table has lost interest 50% of the way through the game.

RATING: 9
Elegant and simple mechanics, probably one of the best implementation of an auction system, great variety of options and paths to victory, fast to play and easy to learn. It's good with any number of players, you learn its main dynamics just after the first turn and then it's all a matter of choices, trying to balance your long term strategy to the opportunities that every turn presents. You have to maximize the effectiveness of every action you have at your disposal, while managing your resources in order to gain victory points and more actions. The system is simple enough to give you always the right perspective on your situation and let you concentrate on your options, to the point that, at the end of the game, you can easily spot the errors in your strategy, what went wrong and how it did. There’s not much direct interaction among the players and theme is not exactly dripping from the mechanics, but it’s one of those rare cases in which I don’t mind.

Great (as usual) Hans im Glück quality: good components, well designed and functional. You could use a playing aid about exploration cards and tile use, but a couple of plays is all you need to learn the meaning of every symbol.

P.S. remember to use the right rule about the exploration path: first discard the cards that would be in excess and then draw the new ones.

Superb game. Only played with 2. Filled with tense decisions and alternative strategies with an excellent balance between managing your own position and countering your opponents. Would be a 10 if it weren't for the suspicion that it's so well-balanced that almost anything you do might lead you to victory or defeat and it's not possible to tell what actions leading where but hopefully more plays will sort that

Individual action/optimization strategy game with an auction phase central to each round.

You're a spice trader who has VERY limited actions to get spice to ship, ships to ship the spices, money to purchase new and helpful items, action cards that allow you special benefits, and risky ventures to find new and valuable spice colonies.

Each turn you have to decide if you're going to advance (which you need spice and ships to do), or if you're going to "cash in" at the particular level you're at (which you often need to do).  The further you advance, the more points you get, and the greater the benefits when you "cash in".  You'll always want money, because it's crucial to purchase items in the auction phase, plus most money is worth points at the end of the game.  You won't be able to resist grabbing action cards, even though their benefits encompass a very wide range, and they're also worth points at the end of the game.  And who can resist trying to found new spice colonies, since they not only give you points, but also valuable spice storage capabilites.  You're also tempted to move down the columns evenly, in order to moderately increase points across the board, and to obtain the coveted extra actions, but there is also the desire to go deep in a column to further increase points and obtain free action cards.

The auction phase is central to the game, has some innovation to it (re: the flag-bearer), and it actually works exceptionally well from 2-4 players.  In fact, the overall game plays equally well with 2-4 players, and ranks among the more strategic and most requested games by myself, my wife, and my friends.

Our group played our first and had great fun discovering this game.  Since we were all new to this game we played in teams of 2 for a total of 8 players. It did make the game longer(4 hours) but we had a better chance of exploring the strategy. Everyone wants to do play it next Friday and I hope to bring down play time under 2 hours.

151117 Need to revisit this fellow, though it might be at the bottom of classic games I'd revisit if I had a choice.

130929 A couple plays later I'm just not fond of this game.  Part of the issue is that I don't like games with technology trees.  So even though I like auction games I just don't enjoy this one.  I also don't enjoy having to flip cards over to see if I win my colony -- for that sort of randomization, I much prefer dice instead of card counting.  So with those two big strikes, its way too long of a game for me to enjoy.

RATING: 7
1 play / 3 players

LIKE: A classic, dry game that has held up because of its unique spacial-auction mechanism and tightly woven upgrade system. I enjoyed the feeling that everything felt balanced and I wanted one-more action. I also enjoyed how the money could shift to another player during the auctions, as this added a nice extra option when decided on tiles to auction.

DISLIKE: A money-snowball effect can happen if tiles are not valued and bid upon properly in the opening game. The game is dry, and modern gamers are less enthusiastic about it.

OVERALL: I like it. I wish it would get an update and available to more people. I feel that from a high-level this game doesn't stand out as much as it should, other than the central auction. Art or theme change would address this. Considering how long ago this game came out, I wish other designers used it as a bar for their designs, as everything is so tightly packaged together.

(Side note: The game is almost language independent once the iconography is deciphered.)

RATING: 5
Goa has a poor interesting decisions vs. play time ratio. Auctions are the meat of the game and the phase of greatest interaction, but they only constitute 15% of the play time. Most of the time is spent on solitary paralysis when you are trying to make the best use of the actions no one can block or influence. This part of the also grows linearly with increasing player numbers.

I have to say that Goa was an ok experience but it is not a game I would suggest.it just is too long for what it i, which is a shame since I usually like auctions.

My son was not interested in Goa, which is rare for him not to want to play a new game, but we made a deal with him that if he won, he could stay up two hours past bedtime. Needless to say, he was very attentive to the explanation of game play and did a great job, even took the "A" round hands down. He ended up loving it, but came in third. (We still let him stay up a little later.) I asked him what he would rate this and he said a "9". I could not agree more. Love, love, love Goa.

Finally another meaty game by Hans im Glück. There is not a lot of player interaction except in the auctions, but it's a good game with loads of decisions. A real Gamer's game. You'll probably like it if you like Puerto Rico, Zepter von Zavandor or Outpost.

The best new game I have played in 2004. The blending of resources is sublime. 

The immediate view of its quality was to compare this game with Puerto Rico and Princes of Florence, both of which it resembles in various ways. 

While there is some solitaire planning, you do need to follow what others are doing and the auctions of course do involve all players. 

Even after playing this a few times, there appear to be multiple routes to victory, which suggests the game is as promising as it feels.

There is no doubt in my mind that this is a 10 game for me.

I had heard a lot about this game. It plays pretty quick, the auctions are fun, and the game feels like a mix of Puerto Rico, Endeavor, and an auction game. I think this is probably also one of those games that improves as you play it more. 

Most Euros I feel like there's less to them with repeat plays, but I think this one would be better the second time. These ratings though, are reflective of first impressions. In that sense, the game was ok, but nothing unique out of the gate.

If only we could play more often!  It's a great game, but it is always [i]stressful[/i] -- every move counts.  So it doesn't work as an evening's fun, and leaves you thinking long after the game is over.  The tiles (yes the tiles, not the expedition cards) serve the purpose of cards in Agricola, varying the game with each play -- but Dorn's done it better, in that in Agricola most cards are fairly weak, while in Goa the tiles can be critical -- but you get to bid on them, which makes it less luck-dependent.

True, the expedition cards can introduce random luck, when both players play well, but a little luck isn't bad.  Not every game must be Caylus.

What's more, as our plays increase, it becomes less stressful, and the rules are surprisingly easy to remember even if you go a month or two without playing.  It's just a great game!

The rules are written in a way that is absolutely confounding. It completely ruined the first game for me and my bf, and I can see us putting off another game because of it. I have since downloaded a bunch of game and player aids to help us in case we do get a game in (and I can already tell they'll help big time). Since Goa is so highly rated as a 2-player game, I want to play again before I rate it.

UPDATE 1: Finally got a chance to play Goa with 4 players, and it took all of us nearly forever to figure out the rules based on the rule book. However, well worth the effort! For me, Goa is in the same category of games as Puerto Rico, Caylus, and Power Grid - except Goa is way better! I will elaborate another time! UPDATE 2: Lowered my rating due to painful headaches that appear when I think about the rule book - 2 hours to go over the rules and find answers to basic questions!

Like this design very much! After reading the review of the new edition in the Spielbox, I decided to get the OLD one.
The so-called design flaws in the old edition will never occur with my gaming group, given how seldom we play.
I like especially the interesting auction system and the push-your-luck possibility when discovering new colonies - will I play safe with enough settlers, or am I pushing my luck, assuming there will be a 2 or 3 settlers card on the card pile?

Fantastic game. Fairly deep yet simplistic in design and execution. However, it can be very mentally taxing since every move you make must be optimized to play efficiently. 

Dropped to a 6 from an 8. Dislike how everybody starts out unique (different advantages in separate skills), but becomes more similar over time. Comparative advantage is still maintained at game's end, but not by much (player distinctions become lessened through advancement, which is the opposite of what I'd normally like). 

Nice game otherwise. Perhaps a bit abstract.

New version. It does feel a bit dated in the components and how spare the game mechanisms are (games seem to be gravitating toward "kitchen sink" designs). But, nevertheless, it has a solid auction system that holds up for two players and then just a lot of constraint on your choices and what you'll be able to accomplish within the game. Upgrades on the various tracks are essential, as you hate to take actions when you've not upgraded, but you need to balance that with actually doing things.

A fine Euro that holds up (better than Princes of Florence, for example).

A very solid Euro with a bit of everything, from bidding to action selection and combo making (yes, that's not a game mechanism, but there's no other way to describe it). 

Good things: 
- it's interesting all the way until the end
- there are plenty of options 
- the luck element does not make or break the game or the winner

Bad things:
- one strategic mistake and you're out of the path to victory. The most you can still hope for is that every other player will make at least 1 mistake.

Neutral:
- people with good memory will have an advantage, I was able to keep track of everyone's money until the end of game, which gave me a strategic advantage at auctions and 3 VP for richest player

An interesting game that combines planning the growth of your colony (developpement board), adjusting to your acquisitions in the auctions board and choosing the level of uncertainty (luck) via the expedition cards.  It seems that there is always a certain type of spice missing and that make for a stimulating challenge.  30 games played mostly 2 players, my preferred configuration by far.

3/20/08 Played at Matt and Brad's place with Sterling, Joshua and Brad. Sterling and Joshua had played the game before. Basically you have money and and bid each round on plantations (that give can produce goods), various special abilities and special actions. Before the game even starts you need to decide upon which strategy you will implement in the game. Although through the bidding process you strategy might be foiled. That is unfortunate but you must still maintain a clear idea/strategy. This game rewards planning and implementation. It is not very forgiving. I don't think it would play well with less than 4 players. Overall Goa is a very complex Auction/Bidding euro game. After 1 play I would rate it a 8.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
Long game that has almost too much to do. The strategic horizon can be very limited and paths to victory are hard to plot. Extra actions are a necessity in order to progress, so they become the touchstone and I would bet that there is a clear correlation of players with more actions receiving higher scores. It seems like such a general and unforgiving necessity that to lose out on gaining extra actions leaves a player with limited options. Also, it is *very* difficult to figure out who to bid against because it is hard to determine who is leading.

There is very little time to do way too much.  I have only played this game three times (and have yet to win).  I have yet to figure out any good strategy to this game.  Also the player with the most money tends to run the game.  Compared to other games of this genre, I really am not impressed with its mechanics.  They tend to get too one sided.  More plays of this game with different people may change my mind to it, but for now I will probably play it if everything else gets a bit overdone.

RATING: 7.5
{1 play, 4 player}  It was good, but I made some pretty bad mistakes (at one point I "misread" a spice tile, thought it was red when it was brown) and still came in a close 3rd: 39, 36, 35, 34.  So I'm a bit concerned that after all that thinking (and there are a lot of decisions to be made here) it might not make much difference... but that's probably not the case.  I hope.

*** UPDATE [initial rating: 7] ***

Played a few more times, and I think my original worries are, in fact, correct.  Barring major mistakes, I don't think your action choices are as relevant as they feel (and boy, do they feel that way), which means, really, that the auctions are everything.  And for now, I don't care.  Even though I still feel a bit unsatisfied afterwards, I really like being "in the middle" of this game.

[ESP] Goa es un juego de bidding y manejo de recursos. Las compañías compiten en el negocio de las especies, enviando barcos y colonos al mundo e invirtiendo dinero. El éxito dependerá del modo en que se inviertan los recursos: aumentando la eficiencia de los barcos, mejorando las plantaciones, reclutando nuevos colonos, etc... lo que a su vez significarán más puntos de victoria.

i'm not sure if i've played this once or twice.  i did really enjoy it, but i can see the complaints about the power of the expedition track and the somewhat static nature of the game.  if something's going to be auction-driven, i think i tend to like it completely blown open or distilled down to currency basics like modern art.  when static progression choices are tacked on, i think it's really important to focus on the balance and offering multiple genuine paths to victory.  that isn't to say that i think one can only win with expeditions, i certainly don't have the experience for that.  i would be surprised if this game were extremely replayable for me though, and thus it was a trade.

I was skeptical of the auction in Goa before I played it the first time, but I love this game. The auctions are usually tense and interesting, but my favorite part of the game is definitely the management of the development tracks. I love trying to find ways to chain together multiple developments in order to get extra actions and expedition cards. I love trying to find the most efficient way to use my resources and money to advance the tracks in this game, and I don't think I will ever get tired of playing this game.

Similar in spirit and cause-of-fun to Puerto Rico, but less susceptable to being fouled by haphazard players.  However, the expedition cards introduce a strong luck element that PR is able to  avoid.

In any case, this is a strategy discovery game, so it probably has a limited replay half-life.

Only 1 play, but already I can see all of it's potential. True, the expedition cards can add a very random element to an otherwise very strategic game, but I find it's a healthy dose of luck: just enough to keep it interesting.

Plus, the auction selection mechanic is just brilliant. It only takes a couple minutes each round, but it's one of the best parts of the game.

UPDATE: Still love it, but I wouldn't always suggest it. I guess that brings it down to an 8.5.

First game.  This game was definitely inoffensive yet not exciting.  This game just doesn't excite me all that much.  Don't get me wrong.  I like economic games, but this just didn't give me a very good first impression.  The mechanics are sound enough and interesting enough.  The flag is a pretty cool mechanic and how bidding revolves around it.  The biggest strike for me against this game is the one time bidding.  I just don't like that very much.  I don't know, maybe then if we did it power grid style, then I would complain about the game being too long.  Another thing that bugs me about this game is that it seems that there is one set strategy, which is to upgrade your Expedition Track all the time so you can get those crazy widly varied powerful expedition cards.  You then build your short term strategy as to take advantage of the expedition cards that you recieved.  Rinse and repeat.  I also do not like how convoluted the scoring is.  I guess it is good to recieve points for all the various things that you do but they are not linear so it gets tedious scoring at the end of the game.  I guess we will see how my impression of the game becomes.  For now this falls in mediocre category for me.

Goa is an unusual auction game, with an auction mechanic that allows a challenging and engaging play even with only 2 players. It is also a resource management game, with a race like feeling, because players receive rewards to reach certain goals before the others.
Every element in the game is so interwoven with the others that the game can be very hard to explain, and quite heavy to play, so I don't know how much play it will see... (but the not-so-long playtime can give it an edge!).
Nevertheless, it is a wonderful game, and it starts with a 7.5. Hopefully I will play it some more times to raise its rating...

I believe that the difference between drawing 2 Colonists and drawing 6 Colonists when attempting to found a Colony is just too severe a setback in a game that otherwise rewards careful planning and efficiency.  I also have concerns about a player matching too many or too few symbols from Expedition Cards.  Although I should just be accepting of the level of randomness in Goa, I often wonder if Goa is simply too random for its own good.  

Goa is really good the first few times you play.  After a few more plays, the game starts to feel stale.  I believe that the truly great games become more enjoyable the more times you play.  Unfortunately, my peak enjoyment level for Goa was around my 4th session.  Perhaps the randomness adds a little bit of spice to an otherwise good (but sort of stale) game.

This is a wonderful game that combines an auction/bidding stage with an action point stage, similar to Princes of Florence.  The players always bid on the starting flag, but then each get to pick one item to auction afterwards, making the placement of auction pieces key.  After the auction round is complete each player gets a minimum of three actions, though extra actions are available, and valuable, through a couple different methods.  Even if you have an extra action each turn, you still want more.  There is a really nice balance between resources, economics, auction and action and is a highly recommended game.

An auction based game with what appears to be several strategies to acquire points and win. You manage Dutch colonies in the East Indies and are trying to improve various parts of this endeavor, such as farms, shipping, colonists, etc. I enjoyed the theme and competing with other players to acquire the stuff I needed or make them pay dearly for allowing them to get it. The once around auction style makes for quick turns, necessary because there are 5 auctions every turn in a four player game. 

I won the fewest auctions in my only game, always concerned about not paying too much for things, even though I wasn't sure what that was. Because I kept losing auctions even when bidding what I though was high, I concentrated on colonies and won the match!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I quite liked my first play. The only problem I have with it is that the current start player can keep his position as start player (and gain the extra action) at a lower cost. If he had the option to raise and keep it - which is still an advantage - that would make it better for me. Will see how this house-rule goes down.

After 5 plays, I really like it. Great mix of strategy with a fun auction that can play a critical role in the game. Even though there aren't any ways to hose other players, you must manage the auction well to do well in the game. I like how there is a bit of a "race" element in upgrading your abilities. The auction phase keeps things from getting too predictable or mechanic. The action phase goes by quickly. A very fun game.

Took three games to get the rules right but this is now a top 10 favourite. The mechanisms are beautifully balanced with the constant feeling that you need just one more action to do what you need. Sharp focus on what is achievable needed at all times. So many ways to win. I want to play more.

11 years pass and I play again to a new crowd. I was excited to show off this old gem but over a decade later, it just goes to prove that nostalgia aint what it used to be. I did remember the luck that presented itself with the colonies but I seemed oblivious to how swingy the expedition cards are and how they can be utterly useless if you lack the funds etc. Come game end I am utterly disappointed to realise that the luck element is so great. My '9' rating is totally out of proportion with more modern games that earn this high score and I must down grade to 7.5.  Perhaps time to sell on.

Rating after one play. I really liked this game and want to play it again soon. Definitely a gamers game. I'm a little worried that the rules may be difficult to teach to some people. I "got it" after a few turns, but I suspect this game takes a game or two to reveal what your best opportunities are and when you should execute one action. 

2013 Update: Revisited this classic and bumped my rating to a 9. This wonderfully balanced game is a great blend of mechanics. The auction, actions and bonus actions are all worth figthing for. Great game!

A great game. Sadly there isn't much player interaction other than in the auction phase, and there's not much there either. Initially you don't seem to get any clear idea of what to do but everything in the game is interconnected. This sadly leads to a feeling that the game almost plays by itself, since you often don't have any tough decisions to make. There is also very little chance involved, which can either be a good or bad thing. Still I like this game, though as it's only for a max of four players it doesn't get to hit the table as often as I want.

Wonderful and deep game about developing spice trade in east. Auction system is clever for it is fast but need careful judgement about tile values and strategy adopted. Furthermore players can inflate or deflate currency with their actions and this is very important.
Played many times and still evalueting different strategies. Cards can seem too powerful, but my experience is that the game is very well balanced. There is not just one winning path.
Our group record is 51 points using ship/spice strategy. Note that in our latest games all 4 players score well above 40.

After being on the shelf for quite a while, I finally was able to play this game again. I must say the game itself is a very good combination of an auction game with an engine building game. All the mechanics work together like a charm and create an intricate puzzle for the players to try and solve. The bidding and bonusses to be won provide just enough interaction to save the game from a multi player solitaire feel. All in all a great game which I hope to play more in the coming time. Oh, just dont expect that the actions you take have anything to do with Goa or colonizing in general. This is a very abstract Euro. But it's a good one.

I'm getting better at this. Played my third game with practically no memory of the first two, but somehow I won finally. I think I'm gonna purchase my own copy.

Definitely something to getting the flag. You need extra actions to get and do extra stuff. I feel like Ginger/nutmeg-working the outside colonist and ships box worked well for me. But it could have been because my opps weren't employing the same strategy. Much to learn in this one and I know I've just scratched the surface.

Definitely need to work the expeditions more. Why? Because they give you flexibility. Flexibility is so important in this game.

After 7 plays, I've decided that this is a really good game.  The more I play it, the more I appreciate it.  It's good with 2-4 players, but definitely best with more.  After playing the original several times and the New Expedition once, I believe the improvements in the new edition are really good and make the game better.  They are not major, but just tweaks that improve the game.  If I play this once or twice per year, that would be good.

The different mechanics in this game don't gel right away, but once you get moving they work well enough and make for fun choices.  I dropped this game a whole point, though, based on the overpowered expedition cards, especially their potentially game breaking bonus structure at the end of the game.

This game works very well as a 2-player bidding game.

Goa: A New Expedition is a gamer's game. It ties with Bora Bora for first place in my collection. Goa is brilliantly designed and scales well with any number of players. Multiple paths to victory, high replay value, and easier to learn than it looks.  Great components, clever auction mechanic, constant tension, and always more options than opportunities to exercise them. If there is one thing that I would improve it would be player interaction.  Still, Goa is a superb, solid 10 Euro game.

[Got it new and very cheap with damaged box on eBay.]
I love this game more and more every time I play it. The resource management feels a little like Puerto Rico but with even less time to accomplish your goals. I got this because I heard it works great for 2 as well as more. With 3 and 4 it's great--one of my favorites. I wasn't that crazy about the 2-player game. If one person gets behind in money, they have no chance at any tiles. Seemed like a run-away leader problem with 2. I'll try it again, but I'm disappointed.

UPDATE: Just learned--after four plays--that I've been playing it wrong--I haven't been giving free spices with every plantation purchase. This might help mitigate the 2-player run-away leader issue. Will re-evaluate after next play.

UPDATE 2: Finally played again with 2 players. It was fine. I usually had less money than the other player, but I ended up winning by three points. Granted, I'd played 10 times before, and she'd never played. She probably should have beaten me by taking a few more of the auctions, but I think it would have been close, anyway. I did enjoy the 2-player game more this time.

I'm not quite sure what it is about Goa that makes it a hit whenever I introduce it--it certainly isn't the endgame scoring, which is very math-y and has some annoying minor rules you just have to remember. But I've yet to see a group of players *not* take to it. The limited number of actions combined with a very competitive auction and a "get there first" mechanic encouraging players to specialize in different ways make it an tense, interactive, and very strategic euro. And all of those traits are exactly what I want out of a euro.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pegging this at 9, despite slight imbalances.

Update:  Further plays shifted my views on the expedition card "problem."  If anything, this game needs more imbalances.  As it is, you can succeed pretty well using any track combined with expedition cards.  This really limits any strategic maturation within the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A new favorite.  Lots of choices to make each turn and it seems like there may be several strategies to win (although some people on bgg don't think that is true).  One of those games where you have to make sure you will have enough turns to get everything done that you want -- like Traders of Genoa and Princes of Florence, which makes for good tension at the end of the game.

This could possibly go up to a 9 in the future -- but in our first game we played (surprise) with a couple of incorrect rules.  Will give this a try again soon and see if it is as good as the first game makes it seem.

Have played a two player game.  Good but since it was my first game I made a big mistake early by not getting enough money.  This led my son to win both tile auctions for money and getting his additional action cards for paying for each.  Also played a three player game; better than two.  I am looking forward to a four player game.

I have now played a 4 player game.  Enjoyed it and won by getting the colonies.  However, I'm just not getting this to the table often enough with limited space, thus may be willing to trade or sell.

RATING: 6
Okay game if you like economic games with lots of auctions, but (for me) it runs a bit too long for the amount of fun involved.  The auction mechanism is a little weird to wrap your head around at first, and there is a lot going on in terms of technology trees and combining actions to get yourself ahead in the game.  Novice players can "wreck" the game since they don't have an appreciation for the actual value of items (especially extra actions).  Additionally, there might be a slight runaway leader if someone gets too far ahead in cash.  Typical final scores are 30-50 points.

2012 update: Through no fault of your own, you can get really shafted with respect to your choice of tiles (or lack thereof) that you can put up for auction.  This can cause some sizeable money imbalances and "slow starts" for some players early in the game.

2014 update: I don't like it. No control over bad auction placements and people bidding too much to remain competitive or not bidding enough to put pressure on the leader.

** NOTE: I'm curious to test Double Dan's theory that the Exploration/Spice track combo (even with no discarding before or after drawing cards) is an unbeatable strategy w/4 players.  Also, Larry says that a variant rule for the Exploration cards is needed for the 1st edition.

RATING: 8
This game immediately reminded me of PoF: choosing how best to develop your board in order to collect the most victory points. Player interaction is also limited to the auctions. Goa has a higher learning curve because a larger number of strategies are possible, which raises it above PoF for me. I like that there are a lot of things to do and choose from each turn, with the option of getting extra actions.  Unfortuntely doesn't see the table as much since our game groups have expanded beyond 4-player gatherings.

Lots of paths to victory in this one. It seems that each auction has something helpful, so losing one auction just means a cheaper buy of another useful item...  This was probably the first tech-tree game I played but I love that mechanic.  I really want to find a copy of this.

From all the games from Rüdiger Dorn I played. I easily find this his best. They don't come more cube-pushy euro than this, but when done right, I'm all up for it.

The stack of cylinders is a mechanic that seems to have transferred from Genoa, but now has its place in a much better setting. It's auctions for resources, combined with simple engine building, where the engine building itself is responsible for most of the victory points. Simple and clean.

Unlike Genoa not every resource or agreement is tradeable, but auctions are more ordinary, just using money. This, and the fact that auctions happen by default makes it suitable for a much broader audience.

Pretty much a classic.

Wow! My first time playing it and I was impressed! It reminded me of New Amsterdam and made me wonder why I'd ever choose that over Goa. It was simple and elegant without as many moving parts but with multiple viable strategies. It's an auction game where you bid for tiles X number of times during each of 8 rounds (where X is the # of players) over the game. Each tile either gives you additional space to put one of 5 different types of goods or gives you a one off (possibly recurring) bonus. After each set of auctions, players get 3 actions where they can advance tech tracks, get resources, or discover islands. At the end of the game, you get VPs for islands, tech advances, and a few other things. It was simple, elegant and I'd love to play it again. Why do we need new games when we have these old classics to play!

Es un juego de desarrollo. Cada jugador dispone de dos tableros. Uno en el que aparecen determiandos parámetros (que corresponden con acciones que escoger), y otro en el que ubicar losetas para almacenar mercancías y colocar losetas de conolización.
Cada turno tiene dos fases. Una en la que se colocan marcadores de secuencia de pujas y las pujas correspondientes por adjudicarse la loseta. La otra fase consiste en la utilización de tres acciones por cada uno de los jugadores. El tema se repite cuatro veces con el primer set de losetas y otras cuatro con el segundo set.

Al final se puntúa según el nivel de desarrollo que hayas obtenido en el panel, y según la cantidad de losetas de colonización.

Es un juego de bastante cálculo y sesudo, de los que a mí me gustan. Altamente recomendable y con reglas fáciles y asimilable por no jugones. Dura sobre la hora y media.

Lo compré en un pedido a juegamestore, aprovechando el vale entregado en las CLBSK2012. Lo recibí el 1/06/2012

It's a dry Euro. There's nothing like "shipping spices" or "harvesting spices", there is no "developing your different branches". You never have the feel that you are really doing something like building ships and gathering colonists: it's an exercise in paperwork and as exciting and funny as sitting through a meeting with your ex-wife's lawyer.

A game for people who like filling out MS Excel sheets. I'd play sporadically, but there's not much that I really like about this game. Worth the hype? Definitely not!

The neat thing about this game is that there are truly many viable ways to achieve victory.  One game I didn't buy a plantation and yet was still competitive (go cities).  It wasn't a planned strategy but I was able to make it work.  It takes a play or two to achieve a comfort level as there is a lot going on.

Very fun, lots to think about.  Not as good as PR, simply because I think it's now common knowledge that there is only one or two paths to success in Goa as opposed to several in PR, but still, a very good game along that theme!

Seemed  long for what it was.  I think there are far superior games in the similar genre (like Princes of Florence).  I also agree with a comment above that it seems that once you fall behind, you aren't going to catch up.  

Although if you fall behind and draw the right expedition cards, you might have a chance.  Only because some of  expeditions are ridiculously powerful (kind of like the path/hut business that ruined the new Entdecker).

Very engaging game. I was surprised at how well it plays for 2 players. Progressing down the five different areas requires some thought with regard to the final scoring and attention must be kept upon the several secondary scoring opportunities, especially with the expedition cards. Came in first my first play against two vets (and one other newbie), which is a rare occurence for me on a first play.  The auction is more versatile than other games with auctions, and allows for a fun two player game. Also somewhat solitare, but not really any more than Agricola. Multiple paths to victory.

A very solid but somewhat too devious game for me - that's not a bad thing; it's just that I'm not devious enough!  Early mistakes hurt badly in the long run and, especially in a 2-player game, it can be very difficult to restrain the leader.  The wealth of choice and paucity of actions makes for some demonically strategic play.  This is definitely the game for someone who likes to batter his opponents with economics!

I initially held Goa in great esteem until I played with someone who, after stating there was a broken strategy, proceeded to mop the floor with us using said strategy. That realization somehow soured the game for me, and now it no longer entices me as it used to.

RATING: 7
Four player games can end with only a few points between first and last. The games are very tight. Sometimes too tight for the result to be meaningful. 

There is minimal player interaction. This is the quintessential multi-player solitaire euro of maximizing self efficiency. Nevertheless, this is a solid game. 

Rating update: 8 -> 7. After 6 games, I've confirmed Goa's Achilles' heal. The exploration card track is unbeatable. If someone has a set of 4 or 5 cards, then it breaks the game.

This is NOT a game with multiple equivalent paths to victory. There is a single path that dominates all others leading to poor replayability :-(

A real pity that such an otherwise well designed game is 'broken'.

Update: A New Expedition attempts to fix it. Based on one play, the card collecting seems to have been dampened. But the power of using Expedition cards is still there. It's less broken, though the power of that 4th track is still there.

I do spreadsheets all day at work. Couldn't stomach the idea of doing one while gaming.

The canonical 'heavy euro'. This one's from right before they got way too complicated & fiddly (e.g. Agricola, etc.) for their own good. I think this is right at the tipping point of complex piece manipulation vs. deep game play - any more complicated to set up or play and I'd be turned off. Looking forward to trying this.

Based on 1 play:

I really like this game! I think I like it about as much as I enjoyed Puerto Rico on my first play! Similarly I can see this game moving up in rating if it holds up after repeated plays(unlike Puerto Rico). I think it will take quite awhile to properly value all the tiles let alone form good strategy! I look forward to finding out as I will almost for sure purchase this in September. Great Game!

Mid-weight auction game. I'm really enjoying the "economic engine" element of it thus far, but am concerned that the Expedition Track is "too powerful" (whatever that means in an auction game). Anyway, I'd heartily recommend it to anyone looking for a good auction game for 2 players.

Note: I am enjoying it more and more with repeat plays.

Played once. I want. 

After 2 years, I finally got my copy with the Z man reprint. My experience from my one play years ago was not an aberration. What a fantastic game Mr Dorn has created with Goa. From the tactical positioning of the auctions placements, the actual auction mechanic, the usage of one's actions and the fantastic tech tree, Goa is the first game in a long while which I could consider being my absolute favorite game after more plays. Time will tell.

Goa is awesome.  When we first got it, I was just so-so on it, even though I'd been lusting after it for a long time.  The more I play, though, the deeper it gets.  It's a hard game to score high on!  A bit spreadsheety, but the auction mechanism is very well done, and works incredibly well with just 2 players.  Why don't more auctions add a spacial element?  The production values are top notch as well.  I'm a sucker for exploration themes, done to death tho they may be, and no, that doesn't make me an overlord oppressor.  Just the idea of those bearded dudes "running" to help me colonize gives me a warm fuzzy - bring it, Dutch Masters!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Whoa, this one's intense. So many things to keep track of, so many difficult choices, and you often only get one shot at them. What your partners choose has a direct impact on what you can do, and you always find yourself one or two actions away from doing what you really want. A very tight, tense game.

The auctions are painful, primarily because it's hard to gauge how much each tile is worth (since that value changes throughout the game depending on how much money people have). So during the bidding rounds, since you only have one shot, you may grossly over- or underbid on an item, which will give you a huge disadvantage that turn. One stupid mistake can make or break the game. I have made that stupid mistake three times. Sigh.

Falls flat every time I play it.  Seems like I wasted my time when I'm at the end of the game, even when I've won.  Really dry game and the horrible theme suck the life out of this one.  I'm really not asking for this one to come out, even though I do well at it.

BTW, if you want to win.. just concentrate on nutmeg.

I've played this now a number of times so it was high time I rated it. The bits are nice, the gameplay is relatively good. The auctioning is fun (nice mechanic), but I find the game a bit dry. It's a bit too complex for what it returns. This is a personal thing, but I find some of the euro games have too much complexity. It's almost as though the designer thought the game too simple and threw in yet another mechanic, or scoring mechanism, or resource.... 

I will certainly be playing Goa again, but I don't think it belongs in the top 25. One particular thing that I find somewhat annoying (along with many of the people I teach it to) is the different manners in which VP can be gained. This is usually a good thing, providing more than one avenue to success, but for Goa it seems there are too many and that they are tacked on. 

A difficult game to learn, but worth it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I didn't find it to be either as complex or as strategic as its reputation might suggest. Instead, I thought the play was tactical, with a focus on the short term. Tempo is very important, as is money management, but in general, the triangle number scoring paths leading to victory points are so closely balanced that the best overall path is to go for what you can maximize in the short term. I can understand players agonizing over wanting to do too many things but having too few actions to do them, but one answer to that is to buy the flag, tax with the extra action, and spend the money to buy the flag again (along with another extra action) in the next round. But for its length, I would put Goa clearly in the family game category.

RATING: 8
I've been holding back a bit rating this game due to the question about the possibly overpowered Exploration track, but now, playing with the apparently correct Hans im Gluck rules, I will ... I really like Goa. As these high-end games go, it really isn't that complicated and is pretty streamlined and, like Traders of Genoa, it innundates you with really hard choices. There is incredibly subtlety to the auction process. Then, do you go for balance, or focus on one or more tracks? Which tracks are important? It's great. And while there are certain truisms (you'll need to pick up some Exploration cards), there are a variety of ways to win - my most recent game I won and never took the Explorer action, I won by running up the Money track and acquiring everything I needed the bidding. Goa is reminicient of Traders of Genoa in the constant temptation to invest in all these cool things you can do, but like Traders, you need to balance long-term focus with taking advantage of short-term opportunities. It's definitely less of a meatgrinder than Traders though. For me, scores big over Puerto Rico and Princes of Florence in the huge variability of the auction phase, so you get a lot of variation in the course of play - you can't play pat strategies as you can in Puerto Rico, you have to keep adjusting.

This one falls for me into the category: happy to play it again, but I'm unlikely to suggest doing so myself. After all, games like Puerto Rico or Princes of Renaissance are more alluring. And far more interactive. Goa simply strikes me as too dry. The subject is great, but I found its implementation not terribly convincing. It felt more like one was playing the mechanics, rather than building up a colonial enterprise.

While winning our first game by a fair margin, I am unlikely to ever suggest this game. However, I am happy enough to play it if others wish to do so. It is after all a good game. But that can be said about SO MANY games these days. Not enough to get a lot of plays with my gaming group.

A bit of a longer game for our lunchtime group (with Colin having to step out for the last round as he had a hard stop) but I am glad we got this one going. I think future plays we can make this work in our hour long lunch. The game suffered from a few iconography issues, but having the rulebook handy got those cleared up quickly. I like the game a lot. Build your engine, a very unique auction mechanism, and working your way to points. I like that it didn't take me too long to see how to build my engine (after a first round shaky start). Everyone seemed to be trucking along, with Spencer just doing that quite a bit better job. Securing second place on a first play definitely helps me enjoy the game. It isn't an instabuy game (like Splendor is) but it is one I would love to come back to again.

Okay, this is just excellent.  Lots of possibilities on every turn, not too much direct conflict, and a few good strategies that can win you the game.  I'd be a bit happier if there were just a tad more in the way of messing up peoples' plans, but it seems like outside the auction phase, there isn't much you can do to affect others.

I've only played once so far, but I enjoyed it immensely.  If only we'd noticed that you were supposed to end Part A of the game after 4 turns, not when the board emptied..

I really like this game.  It takes 2+ hours usually, but it doesn't feel that way.  I noticed 2 things in the last game I played (this is after playing 4-5 games and competing in each one) that I didn't really pay attention to before that makes this game deeper than I thought initially.  Make sure you play with the designer rules, pertaining to drawing for expedition cards, for final scoring.  (Thanks RGG for changing the rules for the worse) 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Problem comes in the action phase. If turns are taken in order, game takes forever; if taken simultaneously, the game loses any feel of interaction and competition. You are playing against the system. 

Also the game provides false choices - banging away at the expedition track is the only way to compete. There is no variety - yeah if everybody knows that it can still be competitive but so what? The opening few rounds are very standard. And getting lucky with matching symbols at the end of the game used to decide nearly every game when I played regularly, which is kind of ridiculous. 

Spectacular auction phase makes up for it somewhat. I love this auction, and wish this style would be copied more often. Great economic system.

I'm glad to hear that Goa is being reprinted, because this fine game deserves to be available to all board game geeks! I like the two different phases in the game, the auction and the action, and I think the combination of the two makes it an interesting game. I think you need to come up with a good plan/strategy to win, but you are never sure what you are going to win in the auction, so you need to be able to shift your focus too and make more tactical moves instead of strategic. I like that there are multiple paths to victory, and I really like the 5 different upgrade tracks! 

However, I have to mention the biggest negative part of the game: the founding colony action... This is a very random part of the game and can really screw you over! In one game I tried to found a colony and got 2 x 1 - after I tried to found a colony again, I got 2 x 1 again! While the other players got 3+2... And I ended up losing by 3 points, which I'm sure I could have managed to overcome if I didn't lose two actions in a row. I don't complain about losing, I don't have a problem with it if the winner played better than me, but when such a random element is a big part of it, it frustrates me.

I think it works quite well with 2 unlike many other games with auctions, though I prefer 3 and 4 with 4 being the sweet spot.

Such a great classic! Simple to play and strategic. The auctions make the game. Highly engaging without direct conflict. There's great replay value with the random tile layout for auction. It plays fantastic with 2-4 players, which is strange for a auction game to play well with 2. Theme may look boring but the game will capture just about anybody after first play.

A great economic strategy game.  I love that it has a 'tech tree' that you can improve over the course of the game.  Some have complained about there being little interaction between players, but the game is usually still tense.  Great for 3 players.

Another tiresome re-working of a German game concept.  Very Puerto-Rico-like, and that is SO played.  On the other hand, I had fun playing, and it IS better than Puerto Rico.

RATING: 6
Received Goa via a trade and gave up Acquire, Tobago, and Incan Gold.

Initial rating an 8 after two back-to-back plays. I've got some divided feelings about this one. On one hand, I love the mechanics, with various resources, tough auctions, and tech routes. On the other hand, the theme is paper thin. Playing this game requires a joy from watching the mechanics at work and trying to manipulate this system. And for me, that's fun. But, the difference between this game and some of my "nines" is that something like Carson City or Shogun has a theme that backs the experience.

Then again, I rated El Grande and Ra a 9 as well, so maybe I don't know what the heck I'm talking about. Ultimately, this is a solid and tense game that plays in a reasonable amount of time.

Update: After playing Goa 5 times, I finally decided that it's a decent but not a top-tier game for me. Ultimately, it feels very themeless... even for a Euro. There's just too many other games I want to pull off the shelf if I want auctions and tech trees.

RATING: 8
The combination of phases in this game is quite interesting, and there seem to be a lot of different strategies to take to be successful.  I like the colony-founding mechanic (random settler draws plus settler cards from hand) and the way in which the different categories are advanced.  Luck plays a relatively small role in this game--unless one has a nasty tendency of drawing exploration cards that are useless for one's strategy.

A longer, heavier auction game. I like the spatial setup of what is auctioned. The game kind of encourages you to be a generalist buts scores you for your specializations. There is a problem of players that fall behind getting locked out of the game. I would now only play with 4, there are serious balance issues with less. I think the 4 ducats per turn tile is overpowered because players never have enough money to bid its true value in the first two turns of the game. 

The more I play, the more I see all players managing to almost complete all tracks. Very computational game. It is enjoyable in its complexity and playing your own little puzzle. Ultimately, it is too easy to max out a track and just not exciting enough for the three hours it takes to play. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I like playing games with some innovative mechanics or can make you involve the theme well.  Goa cannot fulfill both of my needs but it is still a very solid game.  Goa is a well design bidding and card management game but the mechanic is a little bit fading out after almost 10 years and most of its idea has been employed in many other games afterwards.  I believe it could be a very good game in 2004.  I like the ship exploring part most as it can really reflect the chance to discovery and navigation.  But I don't like the random tile layout and some too powerful tile actions.  I like playing this game but I'm not too eager to own it.  

Comments after 3 plays:
the revised rules of GOA.
* Pay 1 less (rather than 1 more) when buying your own auction item.
* Player 1 starts with 5 gold (rather than 7)
* Money action tile gives 3 gold per turn (rather than 4)
* Three number 1 colony cards increased to number 2 (thus, the colony founding deck is more favorable)
* Third row on colonist column gives +4 to colony founding (rather than +3)
* Spice requirements reversed for the "refill plantations" and "gain cash" tracks.
* Special card "pay cash to increase technology level" is not an action modifier (and thus, effectively grants an extra action)
* New "2 colonist" B tile (this seems weak to me)
* New "exchange colonists for ships/spices" B tile (will allow spending those leftover colonists)

The game does not change that much.  I can see it is relatively easy to find colony.  Again, the first player is still too strong.  THe one who engages to card strategy sill overwhelms the game.
I wonder why the revised rules do not change the symbols matching score.  The game play will be twisted if everyone draw cards trying to match symbols in the last 2 rounds.  The game becomes dry and lost its original sense.

7 after one play. But I'd really like to give it another shot. I really like Dorn's stuff, and I can imagine this getting better with repeated plays. The theme thing gets me though. What is the theme here again? And its represented how?

Update after second play: This game has nothing to do with 'multiple paths to victory'. It is an auction game pure and simple. The different tracks merely provide the dynamic that creates the asymetrical values necessary to make the auctions work. Once looked at in this light, it is a better game.

We don't play this one that often, but it's a pretty good game. In fact, I think it's actually probably better then the frequency with which we get it out would indicate.

RATING: 4
More than 2 players: The expedition cards feel a bit too rich and far too random.  The central square and flag mechanism is delightful, but breaks down increasingly as you move higher than 2 players.  While first glance shows many routes to victory, I suspect that in fact there are really only two or three at core due to congestion on ships and money being rapidly depreciated due to diffusion among the other players (buying from the bank is an insufficient drain).  

The two player game is quite good however and should be rated separately at around an 6.5.  Goa is unusual among auction games of working very well with 2 players.

RATING: 8
Rating based on one play. This can go up or down, but I can't see it moving more than one point in either direction. What a solid game. Elements of many things here. The tension and feel of battling the clock like Agricola, resource conversion and plantation building like Puerto Rico, auctions like Power Grid (but better). Gotta say, I need more plays, but this could go to 9. 

2 more plays and its sitting at 8 so far. Could go either way. I really enjoy this game, but it still hasn't "clicked", as in, I'm not able to read the gamestate effectively yet like others I'm more experienced with. Hence the rating stays static. 

Traded away. Really good game, but just wasn't unique enough relative to others.

RATING: 7
Really good. In a game with this much to offer tactically, the expedition luck is a mixed bag. It gels nicely with the auctions, where what you draw will influence what you do (and if it doesn't, either you drew exactly the right cards or you're not maximizing your situation). In other words, I feel that the card mix is almost, but not quite, enough to allow for creative and effective reactions to random draws. It feels almost like there wants to be two decks, one for each epoch, with the more useful cards for each more heavily clustered.

Regardless, the auctions are vicious fun, and the action sequences are a series of delicious puzzles.  While in some games I don't care too much about the trackable 'hidden' information debate, in Goa the game improves dramatically when cash is open. This is a game that revolves around very important auctions dealing with very small numbers, and it seems contrary to the game's calculating atmosphere to have to make decisions based on fuzzy numbers.

Best with 2, almost as good with 4, kinda lame with 3 among experienced players (well-documented in Goa's forums).

Based on 2 plays, both with 2 players.  Outstanding game.  I'm really impressed by how balanced it is.  2 games with 2 players, 4 significantly different strategies, grand total of 3 points separation in scores.  Update: 2 more games with 4 players.  With 4 players, it's still great, although a tad long.

This game has  many choices during both auction and action phases.  The auction is fun and tricky to work for your favor.  The actions are agonizing due to the fact that wasteful moves can hurt a player.  The development tracks are balanced but unique enough to that  one or the otheer can be favored.  My wife used the taxation track to control the bidding, while I tried the harvest and shipping.  Many other possibilities. Nice game.

This is one of those rare auction games that works well with two players.  I enjoy the spatial aspect of the auction as well, and when coupled with the tech tree, it creates a nice blend of player interaction and solo optimization.

In the end, i traded this away.  I admire the design, but the tech tree did not lead to enough specialization in the two-player game (Which is where I would almost always play this).  You ended up maxing out in too many areas for your decisions to have that much impact on your overall strategy.  For the time being, I will keep Louis XIV for the spatial crumb-trail play, which works a little better with the third dummy player.

This game sat unplayed on my shelf for far too long.  The rules complexity dissolved away into intuitive play once I understood the production board and its actions. My game group unanimously were impressed with this game and all wanted to purchase a copy immediately after. 

The auction phase is a splendid concept and well-executed. Some feel the initial flag is an advantage to the first player. I'm not sure. I'll have to pay attention to that over several playings.

Basically take the addictively fast play and variability of Puerto Rico, and then marry it to the tight decisions required in Kramer fare like Princes of Florence, and finally sprinkle on Dorn trademarks like the 'insane turn made possible by taking many extra actions' and you have Goa. 

Winning or losing this game feels *real*, you can usually sit back and point to something you did right or wrong, or even a few things, which contributed to the results, and you *want* to do that critical after-game analysis, the sure sign of a great game. 

All players are really trying to do, at the most basic level, is gain time, but you can do that in a wide variety of ways, extra actions are an obvious choice, but newbies often miss the fact that gaining 4 ships when your ship track is still on level 1 is effectively gaining you 4 actions, or that the oft-maligned Vice King is saving you a minimum of 1 action, but likely at least 2 or perhaps 3 (harvest - ships - the advancement action itself). I think the time saving crux is the root of the Expy track issue, as those cards are one of the only reliable ways to save yourself actions (not to mention pull away in the end game scoring) and if players aren't aware of the track and allow a double nutmeg to go on the block and to go too cheaply then the game can get out of whack in the early going.

If I have a knock on this game, it is that the paths to victory are not as balanced as they appear when you first sit down to the game, and the game has a certain flow that is rather samey from outing to outing. I think the Pepper/Nutmeg (Harvest plus Expy) combo is by far the most powerful one in the multi-player game, and is still a worthy one to pursue with two at the table. This is because the most powerful expedition cards are fueled by having a large harvest action ability (i.e.: Advance for only spice, Harvest in your choice of spice, boats, dudes) and having the extra spice around also allows one to go after the "Sac 6 spice for 4 points" tiles, which are a huge points boost that not everyone will be able to use. The ability to upgrade your whip (bigger taxation numbers) seems to be undervalued by the BGG population at large, but I think it is a crucial third option, and find it extremely powerful in the 2 player game even as a primary strategy. As long as everyone understands the value of the items, the game self-balances to some degree as it becomes a battle for scarce resources, but I do think it negatively impacts my impression of it slightly.

With all experienced hands this game has a lot interesting interactions going on though, and I love the choices involved in where to place the flag, how to bid in the auction, and so on. I still enjoy this game a lot. That said, as it currently sits, I like it, but I'm mildly burned out on it. It doesn't have quite enough variability to really demand even yearly play from me anymore, though it is certainly a cut above most of the stuff out there.


Update Summer 2008:
I've started making use of the variant cards that switch columns 2 and 3 so the pepper/nutmeg combo results in tax and cards instead of harvest and cards, and think that it improves the game noticeably. Since the most powerful cards in the Expy card deck are fueled by a big harvest, making it harder to get that two column combination makes for a more interesting, nuanced game where early game decisions are not as automatic as they were getting for me. I plan to play henceforth with the new cards, and I'm mildly interested in exploring the game again, though I doubt it will ever be a heavy play type of game for me again.

As I suspected, Goa just didn't hold up through time like it should.  After many plays I feel like I'm "done" with it, and I don't particularly care to play again any time soon.  It just doesn't move me to play again even though it's a very well done game.  The strategies are just too repetitive over time, and I'm really tired of winning with my tried-and-true exploration card  strategy.   Nonetheless, this is probably a must buy for fans of Puerto Rico, Princes of Florence, and the more in-depth German games in general- it's good for about 10 plays but then you'll be ready to move on.

I love this game. I don't think I've ever won a game, my wife always kills it on the player board progression aspect. And she seems to always have the extra turn marker (hmmm...connection there??). I love the bidding, the spatial auction options, the decision making always feels TIGHT, and games tend to be pretty close in scoring. It just combines a lot of really fun mechanics and requires some different kind of thinking and planning that it's always very challenging for me to stay competitive. The components are all very nice and high quality. Applying stickers does drive me a bit crazy, but those little spice tokens are very, very cool. One of the best games in my collection.

Goa has taken quite a lot time and a few strategy guides to grow on me. I don't play it very often, but each time I take it out and play it, the game treats me like a good old friend full of fresh, interesting stories. That was different in the beginning, where I was just floundering about and not really paying attention to what would secure me points. In that sense, it has proven to have quite a steep learning curve for me. Ever since I managed to wrap my head aroung the the VP-gathering mechanisms, I could begin to actually play and make life really difficult for the other players: through the auctions. If people are complaining about a strategy being too dominant, what they mean is that they stink at this part of the game. If people are saying it is too much multiplayer solitaire, what they mean is that they've got their playing priorities reversed. Goa is an auction game with a few actions in between; look at it the other way at your own peril.

The second thing you need to learn to manage in this game is time. There's only 8 rounds of play, so make every action you take count, and don't waste your time (and money) on pointless auctions. Learning to balance the cash flow against the actions you must take with the added constraint of there being not enough time to do it in, wasn't an easy task. That is why the game offers many seamingly pointless tiles worth a few points: sometimes buying such a tile is a better alternative than going for the development chart and/or colonies. I had this terrible Pavlovian urge to play the game 'properly' and move all my cubes down the tracks in an orderly fashion: screw that. Points is what you're after, don't go wasting actions on items you won't be using before the end of the game.

The result is a rich and challenging game which, despite it sometimes rather mechanical feel and not particularly evocative theme (what do auctions have to do with spice trade?), offers plenty of possibilities to have you work out the best course of action. Inexperienced players have the disadvantage, but the 'reset' of the action tableau halfway and the fact that the game only takes 8 rounds means that even as an experienced player you cannot take things too easily. There will come a time when Goa no longer holds your interest because players tend to pick fruitful auction locations, but at the rate I am going, that will not be in the forseeable future.

I am a bit surprised that I haven't written a comment for the game that I consider my second favorite.  I love this game, I like the choices I have and the ability to do whatever suits myself.  Some would argue that there isn't much player interaction, but then you get to the auction and if you haven't been planning you can really get hosed, and pay some other player way to much money so you don't lose outright.  A game I need to play more.

One of my favorite two player games.  Would like to play it with more players sometime too.

Acquired May 2007

First play - November 2007 - 2 player Game is good.  Took a while to get wife to warm up to it, but once we got beyond the fact that its not another auction game, she liked it.  We both enjoy games with lots of choices so this is a winner in that regard.  Initial rating is an 8.  Could go up once I play it with more people.  For 2 player, it seems very good.

Second play - Ditto.

Third Play - Like it a lot.  But, the wife feels threatened by this one.  Don't know why, but it just doesn't work for us.  I'll have to find someone  else to play this with.

Fourth Play - Wife is a real trooper.  She's back at it and has a love/hate relationship with this game.

Fifth Play - Game back on the dung pile.  May have to turn to outsiders to get my Goa fix.

While the subject matter may be a little dull and tired, this game wins for the month because it combines a lot of things I like.  Beautiful artwork and cool pieces, many ways to score points, the ability to personalize your journey in a way that suits you, and a little bit of auctions.

Similar to Hansa Tuetonica, players have a board with tracks where they can improve their various action abilities - taking ships, money, colonists, and replenishing their supply of spices.  Everything works together, so focusing too much on any one thing will hurt you in the long run.

It took awhile to really get underneath all the required strategy, but I could see how I'll appreciate it more with future plays.  Dorn is becoming one of my favorite designers, and this classic is definitely a part of that.

The N+1 auction structure and the constrained nature of what tiles can appear for sale ensures that auctions are varied and interesting, and rewards a high level of tactical flexibility. That in itself might have well have compensated for the lack of balance between the development tracks, in which level three cards are practically mandated, spices are far more useful than ships, and money and colonists largely superfluous. But Goa is all about small efficiencies; it takes multiple actions to make marginal point gains on your opponents. A single bad colonization attempt or a good run of expedition cards in the endgame, however, can completely overshadow that, and that's pretty galling.

RATING: 5
Components: Very well-made, and despite all the different sorts of cards and action tiles, the information is layed out in a very intuitive, pictoral manner.

Experience: There is just so much to do in this game, but not enough time in which to do it; I never felt satisfied with any of my actions because they left other objectives incomplete. It doesn't give me the excitement or tension I'm looking for in a game (except in the auction phase).

Bad learning curve, Solitaire strategic production management meets bizarre auction-for-resources.
Flaws: your production is semi-random - you WILL see games where you're stuck with a string of crummy resources NO one will buy, and of course, the luck based set collection of stupid symbols for VPs. I'm tired of strategic production games with set collection.

RATING: 7
Similar to Puerto Rico in that each player is working on their own to try to build a little empire.  Different in that there's little competition for the "best" things to put in their empire.  Better (IMO) because decisions you make in Goa do not benefit others as much as they do in Puerto Rico.  This means you aren't continually deciding what to do based on what helps your opponents less, you can decide what to do based on what helps you the most.

Me parece un diseño excepcional. No se parece a nada de lo que he probado hasta el momento, muy original la verdad, y con muchas mecánicas que encajan a la perfección unas con otras. Además el juego está 100% equilibrado, alguien que sepa jugar te ganará siempre en la primera partida, pero no tendrás la sensación de ser "aplastado" como ocurre con otros juegos. En Goa te divertirás durante toda la partida, ganes o pierdas. Me encanta la subasta, y esa sensación de "tantas cosas por hacer". Es posible que es juego mejore su nota con más partidas, cuando pueda evaluar la profundidad del juego con más criterio.

RATING: 7.5
Good game, but I was disappointed with the imbalance of the different tracks.  The gold track is weak, since the gold you spent an action to take is eventually being paid to another player during the auction.  Not near as exciting of a game as many of the other heavier Euros (Brass, Caylus, Steam, etc.).

That said, it's still a solid heavy Euro, so that means I will always be happy to play it.

RATING: 8
Number of games played: 10 2-player games, 2 3-player games

The good

- Great auction system that works even for 2 players

- Nice strategic gameplay

- Nice engine building aspect

- Not a worker placement game for once.

- Equally enjoyable with 2, 3 and 4 players

- Reasonably low luck factor. Also, there is a (non-official) variant that almost totally eliminates the luck factor, requiring only a minor change to the rules. According to Luca Iennaco: let all expedition cards have "2" as "foundation number" rather than the printed (1, 2 or 3) value.

- Relatively short duration (approximately 2h with 2 players)


The bad

- Very thin theme

- Dull artwork

- Some counterintuitive rules (how exactly to obtain colonists?)

- No quick reference sheet


Conclusion: if there were a stronger theme and more interesting artwork, I'd probably put this game in my top 10.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Initial rating based on only one play, so take this with a lot of salt (or pepper or nutmeg). Clever game that required balancing a lot of things simultaneously. Although it is a classic "lots to do, few actions" game, I never feel hamstrung: there are always good options that open up possibilities, so it's about choosing among several good options rather than the least bad of several bad options. Reasonably quick-playing strategic game that doesn't stall. Negative aspects are that it's not the most interactive game one could envision, it requires experience to know the value of tiles, making it difficult to mix experienced and new players, and expedition tiles are arguably a little overpowered.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An auction game that plays great - maybe even best - with 2p. So much fun!

Edit: I've played this a bunch and it is still one of the best auction-based mid-weight Euros there is. It's the integration of the auctions that really makes it special. There is a ton of game outside of the auction phase, many deep decision points, but everything comes back to getting value in the auctions, and making the most of what you get. 

This is a classic that entirely stands the test of time.

It was one of my favorite games when I first encountered it at the Gathering before its release.  But since then, I have grown fonder of simpler games.  This game is a very heavy brain burner.  Expect 2 hours of everyone sitting and the table and pretty much no one talking or joking around.  If that's what you're looking for, then you love this game.  It is very well crafted.

Where have these German games been all my life?  Oh, Germany.  Anyway, I would put this game in the same box as PoF, except that the bidding is not as dynamic.

Downgraded from a 9 to 8 and could drop further.  Exploration/Spice track combo is an unbeatable strategy w/4 players.  This is even with no discarding before or after drawing cards.

RATING: 9
Solid, meaty game themed on the Portuguese attempts to corner the spice trade out of Goa.  Players auction off tiles (that do an assortment of things), then take actions (improve in shipping, harvesting, tax, expeditions or colonisation) in order to gain victory points.  Victory points are awarded in lots of different ways, the main sources being from your improvements and colonisation attempts.  Lots going on, but a game or two in, it becomes suprisingly fluid and feels very nice to play, with lots of ways to win.  The concept of the "grid" seen in Traders of Genoa returns here to determine what tiles are auctioned - works well.  Excellent with 2, 3 or 4 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This game just seems overwrought to me, but I concede it is a functional one where hardcore strategy fans will excel.

It has many many dozens of auctions over the course of the long game. You all slowly build up a rather same-y engine on your player mats. The amount of inputs required to get something accomplished is crazy. Eventually you build up technologies for growth, colonization, money income, etc.

It also features a bizarre phase where you select which upgrades will be auctioned off. There is a grid, and you must chain the tiles Boggle-style. Novel? Yes, but I fail to see what this phase accomplishes over any other selection mechanism; more weird experimentation at work I suppose.

Lastly the auctions rarely pay to the bank; the tile you selected pays to you (even more severe than in Traumfabrik where it pays out evenly between players). So the timing of the money flows can trip you up too. The money can even bounce between two rich players and leave others out in the cold.

Overall, it's an unbalanced and thinly-themed euro of pushing cubes around via auctions. Ultimately I find it too complicated for the payoff.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Goa. The game of Goa is divided into two sections an A and a B, and within each section there are four rounds, each consisting of an auction and an action selection phase. This very dry sentence encapsulates most the criticism of this game. Namely that the theme is a bit thin and the game is just mechanics, and that the mien is austere. However, I don't think this game is dry at all as the decision space that this game provides - through these mechanics - is so rich. This is achieved without the game being overly complex or long. There are a few smaller rules that can easily be missed from the rules, but these are small print. I have the German version of the game and was initially wary, however the English in the game is minimal, basically use once per round, use immediately and use at end of game, these are also coloured coded. In fact I don't think the German version added anything additional to the picture in terms of extra fiddle and the game ran as smooth as it would have done had this been the English. You'll still have to look up the iconography on the cards, but you would have had to do this anyway had the game been in English. 
 
As to the game: the auctions work extremely well (even with two, which is a massive plus in my book) and give the game a pleasing economic feel, which to me means one of being always conscious of what you can afford and conscious of efficiency and usually with the best move is selected rather than scripted. You are auctioning off tiles, and also the flag which gives you the ability to go first, which is actually quite important in this game - hence has a value. Money is done via cards in this game so that your solvency is hidden.  Once you've won certain tiles, which give you game abilities, resources and the ability to store them (the spice bags are lots of fun) or one off currencies (ships, colonists, money); this is followed by an action selection round where you aim for maximum efficiency on your three actions. The ability of which is determined by the level you have on each ability. A cursory glance at the player boards will get you up to speed. 

The game plays in just over an hour, offers a range of satisfying decision, plays well at two, plays smoothly without long set up, and most importantly for me doesn't really feel like any other game I have owned or played. The auctions are different to the ones in Powergrid, Ra etc. I'd never turn down a game. I'd play you now if you were game.

So much to do, but such limited actions.  It seems that you need to come up with your overall strategy fairly quickly, but fully implementing it is likely to be tricky.

RATING: 7
Solid game that has some of the charm of a simpler era.  The use of micro-actions keeps the game engaging.   The auction mechanism based on the central grid couldn't be more divorced from the theme, but it still works surprisingly well, and that seems to be this game's greatest achievement.  The engine-building might dry up after a handful of plays.   Since so many other folks in the local group own this, I'm not sure that I need to, but 3-4 years ago this would have been a "must-by" for me.

Interesting auction mechanism saves this from being a tedious multiplayer solitaire. Lots of micromanagement, but it was complex in an intuitive way that made sense and offered real variety instead of being more of the same. Dorn is the master of clean busy designs, if that makes sense.

UPDATE: Bumping up to a 7. I don't expect it to go any higher than that. It's a fun game, but there is still too much downtime and not enough player interaction. It reminds me alot of Princes of Florence, but with more length and less theme.  

Have only played once and have to give it a more modest rating until proven otherwise. The game had an exhorbitant amount of downtime during the action phase. Therefore, the game took way too long. The game looked pretty good, but future plays need to be better to earn a higher rating.

Love this game.  Most of the player interaction occurs during the auction at the beginning of each round, but there's an amazing amount of strategy in the bidding, and even more in deciding whether or when to raise the money you need to do well in the auctions.  The strategies for building victory points are many, and bluffing your opponents is a lot of fun, too.  "Better tax those peasants there, Joe, there's an auction coming up!"

RATING: 5.5
Only played once or twice, so still quite preliminary.  I'm not a huge fan of auction games, and especially ones like these where one player is in the driver's seat and you've got to influence them to do what you want.  Bunches of goods tokens in near-indistinguishable shades of brown and a strange randomized colonizing mechanic don't help either.  It's just one of those bland euros without much to recommend it in my eyes.

The auction is very well designed thanks to the tile selection mechanism and the once around bidding.

Loved this game ever since I first played it, and had to buy it (even though it was a tad harder to get my hands on for a good price).

Very happy that it is in my collection and will stay there forever. Such a fun game!

Bidding on what is available and decided on how/when to do upgrading and what action to take can get pretty crazy. But it makes for a very fun playthrough every time. A thought provoking and great gaming experience.

Az első parti: bár 1xrűnek tűnő szabályok, hisz csak lictre felkészülés, licit majd cselekedetek, és a cselekedetek is 6 féle lehet amik jól körvonalazhatók, de sok pici részletecske emiatt hosszan szabály magyaráztunk, no meg nem is ezzel kezdtünk, majd még egy próba fordulót is lenyomtunk a jobb érthetőségért. Utána jött csak a játék. Tetszett: már-már a kedvenc Caylusomhoz hasonlítottam, mármint bonyolultságban és a sok alternatív lehetőségben. A konfrontáció minimális a játékban: gyakorlatilag csak a licitáláskor, és épp ezért nem is nagyon lehet bezavarni más köreibe, nyugodtan építgethet mindenki. A licitálási veszteségeket jól lehet más dolgokkal ellensúlyozni. Elsőre 9-es, de látok rá esélyt, h újabb játékok után ez esetleg 10-re menjen.
Update: most már volt még parti: továbbra is tetszik, egyre közelebb a 10-eshez.
Update 2: még mindig jó, és egyre jobb, bár azért tanulság, ebben a játékban nem szabad szórakozni, pl. csak 2 db 3-as felborított kolonista szükségességével megpróbálni megszerezni szigetet, és 2x is eljátszani mindenképp hiba, amit büntet a játék. :-). Mondjuk így is csak 12 ponttal maradtam le az elsőtől. kis  hiba beleférhet a játékba, vagy nem optimista menet, és attól még lehet jó helyet elérni.
Update 3.: igen, ha az ember nem kockáztat feleslegesen, okosan rakja össze a dolgokat, tud váltani, akkor esélyes az első helyre. Szóval az egyik legjobban összerakott játék ez.
Update 4. Ilyen ré volt: nem em t a játék nem éreztem, nem tudtam váltanai, plusz most először éreztem, h az expediciólapok ha rosszul jönnek mennyire bedönthetik a játékost. Semmi enm jött össze: az első 2 lap segített, onanntól kezdve csak számomra rosszakat sikerült kézbe vennem. PLusz a többi akcióval sem tudtam ahaldni, és itt a másik lényeg: a balszerencsés laphúzásokon kívül a kreatív módszer változtatás sem ment, és még a licitnél is minden ellenem esküdött. Ez a 3-as együtt nem jó.
Azaz a játék nagyon jó, de ha pech szériája van vkinek, -és ez előfordulhat a lap húzásnál- akkor  nagyon a topon kell lenni, és nagyon kreatívan rögtön reagálni kell rá, és megpróbálni más irányokat keresni. Ha ez épp nem megy, akkor a játékos játékának meszeltek.

I lost wonderfully in my first game as it didn't really click for me (the a-ha moment) until turn 6 of 8. :(

Still, it was a wonderful experience and had a lot of fascinating mechanics behind it.  Definitely one of those games where you just can't do everything you want to do.  It's just not going to happen.  The entire game was overrun by someone amassing extra actions and naturally, he won.  Be mindful of anyone picking up those cards as they will run wild if left unchecked.

I'd like to give it another shot to see if my rating still stands.

I enjoyed very much my first game of Goa. I'm very happy that I got this game in my collection. 

I have not played Goa in the last couple of months due to the fact Goa plays only up to four. It would be nice to get Goa on the table again. We are often 5-6 players. Definitely a game which is worth more plays. 

I recently replayed Goa with 3 players and another with 4 players. I had forgotten how fun this game was. 

Fact that when bidding for tiles, the money does to your opponent instead of the bank is a neat twist to the game. You have to judge the value of each tile very carefully. If not, you risk giving lots of money to your opponent for him to buy the next tile or two.

The randomness in the cards is highly annoying. I want to try this with a variant to remove that randomness - or trade it away. I haven't yet decided if it's worth the work to fix.

As is, though, I'm not all that fond of it anymore.

Update: Tried it with a variant allowing players to just select expedition cards which they like. Didn't work. Played very differently, and not particularly well. A tiny mistake at the beginning of the game cost me the game, and I knew it for most of the game.

Decent auction game with plenty of paths of victory. A great way to limit player interaction while still ensuring paying attention to everyone's gameplay is important. The board could use some life, but it's certainly functional. The extra actions each round are essential. Competitive auctions might make or break this game. Feels a bit dated generally and doesn't interest me.

I wanted to like this game, but it feels so much like multi-player solitaire, it's very dry and mechanical, and the theme is so obviously pasted on.  Other than bidding for tiles, your opponents hardly matter.  The bidding phase lacks any tension - if you don't get exactly what you want, you'll still get something else that's useful.  The final scores tend to be very close, not because of a tense struggle, but because everyone pretty much is doing the same exact thing - they will eventually build up colonies and progress on the development chart.  The only significant variable to the scores are the Expedition card sets, which often get drawn at the end of the game as everyone makes a last grab for VPs.  The problem with this, is that a player often wins because he got lucky enough to draw a set of matching symbols.  Goa is not a horrible game, but there are so many better games to play that provide more interaction and strategic tension.

UPDATE: Sold it back when it was going for crazy prices, recently re-purchased. Looking forward to playing it again.

Good game in the Puerto Rico mold. Auctions with some strategy and luck to keep things interesting. (It also suffers less from the Puerto Rico deterministic factor) Also, I'm usually a sucker for the "build your own little economic machine to crank out the VPs" genre.

Unfortunately it suffers from the "this is a great game, but let's add some crazy power cards!" factor. Still it's a great game.

Goa merges auctions with a spatial element with resource management and tech trees.  The first thing that struck me about the game was the auctions.  You start with a grid of tiles with various abilities.  The first player places the first player maker next to one of these tiles and places one of his auction markers on it.  Subsequent players will place their auction markers on tiles diagonally or orthogonally adjacent to the previously played marker.  After markers have been placed you'll have a 'once around' auction ala Ra (the person who is auctioning bids last) and if someone else wins the auction, they pay the auctioneer.  If the auctioneer wins, they pay the bank.  After that you'll use actions to gain resources (a number of types of spices, money, ships, and colonists), increase your tech and set up colonies.  This is a decent mid-weight euro that works with all player counts who I would recommend to any one that likes auctions and either tech trees and/or resource management.  The caveats are the randomness of the expedition cards, the tech trees don't seem balanced (though the new edition apparently fixes this), I worry about any game that allows you to pay someone else (because newbies can throw the game), and I find scoring a little too tight.

Excellent game. Very deep and subtle strategies involved here, which means this game has some legs - you'll spend some time exploring different strategies over many games.

[3 plays] Not sure if I'll like this better or worse when I play it more--could go either way.  It kinda has that auction-game annoyance where I never know how much to bid and feel like everything I do is wrong. I thought the 2nd game was a massacre and was stunned when I only lost by 2 points.  If I could play again before completely forgetting all about this game, I might be starting to get the hang of it.  
UPDATE: I thought I was getting crushed in my 3d game of Goa, only to end up winning.  While I was trying to figure out how that happened, it occurred to me that maybe I won the game for the same reasons I was starting to think I didn't like it.  Well, that would be too strong--I wouldn't say I dislike Goa, but I can identify some things I dislike about it.  I like games like Louis XIV and Macao where nothing is wasted.  Goa is the other kind of game, where the game ends and you have heaps of stuff that you spent blood, sweat, and tears to acquire, but which is now worthless.  This annoys me.  I felt like what happened in this third game is that I couldn't do what I was trying to do--and let it be noted that I NEVER had the flag, not one time--but because the relationship between what the game makes you feel like you should be doing and what actually scores points is so loose, the stuff I did in desperation when I couldn't do anything else ended up propelling me to victory.  Part of my edge was points from cards, which wasn't because I'd been trying to collect them or because I got lucky and got a lot of matching ones, but just because toward the end of the game I had the bad luck to get a bunch of cards I couldn't use for anything.

Pretty interesting, but will always be limited by its thematic disconnect.  Who knew that spices had such interesting and varied powers?

But Goa more or less works for me because the odd central mechanic - the game show like action maze - is pretty fun.  In a game of negative cynics, it seemed that every move was to keep any good tile out of the auctions.  So we scrapped and fought over mediocre rewards, which was fun.  I'm not the world's biggest auction fan, although the movement of the money makes it very difficult to analyze and more pleasantly unpleasant that your average auction.

This was a 9 for me at one point, but I dropped the rating due to a lack of inspiration to play it after about 10 plays.  I always do the same thing -- go down the right two tracks first and fish the deck on the last turn for matching symbols -- and I score about the same every game (and usually win). I'm curious about the changes to the new version, though, and would very much like to try it because there is a lot to like about this one. 

The auction is a wonderful exercise in brinksmanship and spatial positioning. The closed economy means the balance of power swings back and forth in a way that makes bidding decisions extra delicious. There’s a nice rhythm of having three actions every turn (well, plus the occasional extra one) that keeps the game humming along with planning and turn length. I hope to revisit the new version one day.

It's a really solid design, and it's one of the few heavy 2-player Euros I can think of. There are a lot of valid paths to victory, and it's a very tense game overall.  I really dig it.

I have to be honest and mark this down. It is a nice game, and heavy gamers may well get a lot from it. But it has one deep flaw for me, caused by the combination of two aspects: it's a progressive game (so the rich get richer), and it's an auction game (so the rich get richer). Having more money enables you to outbid players to get the resources you need to get more money and so on. I grant you, it is a nice set of mechanisms, the theme works, the spices and ships and the development chart all work, the scoring is nice. It's all there, but killed for me by the richer getting richer and no way to catch up. Screw up at the start and you stay screwed.

I may play this again, but my heart is against it.

Played 1 time, with 4 players. I admit, I liked it, but I didn't "love" it. It definitely has a feel similar to Princes of Florence: both games involve a common auction, and then solitary optimization of acquisitions. Part of the problem with Goa is theme, or lack thereof: this is, for all it's bells and whistles, a game that doesn't feel thematic. In that sense, it feels a lot like Industrial Waste. The good news is there is a lot more strategic options that IW, but not as strong of a connection to theme as POF. Felt a bit too much like IW for my tastes, and although I enjoyed exploring the game a bit, there is nothing in the game itself that draws me back to it.

reading the rules left me with the sinking feeling that i bought another game that was no more than a contrived collection of arbitrary mechanisms that don't add up to more than the sum of the parts (and in some instances much less) but while the game is indeed rather abstract, it has good pacing, rhythm and style, and is quite entertaining.

Feels like a full course meal at a great restaurant.  There's some auctionning, some building, some action-based planning and lots of heart-rending decisions.  My first game was a revelation and a teaser for the many to come.  I was only the first player once and it hurt me; one should balance his ressources so that you can grab the flag more often than not.  Excellent game.

The development tracks fall a bit flat with me, as you upgrade for the sake of upgrading rather than having to use the powers to generate points elsewhere. I'm not sure I like the spatial auctions, either.

This has many more economic game elements in it than you'd think because of the once around auction where you pay the auctioneer.  There's a nice ebb and flow as money goes around to different players and inflation or deflation occurs as money flows into or out of the game.  The relative values of the tiles up for auction for each player make for some agonizing decisions regarding your bidding strategies.  There's a lot more going on than simply trying to buy what you want.  What really sets this game apart (and what makes it great for 2-player) is the once-around auction.  It's so easy for the person after you to just bid one ducat higher and take what you wanted but you don't want to overpay, so you have to get the price exactly right.  Fantastic.

RATING: 8
[System Game, Auction/Action, Economic] {2P:8, 3P:7, 4P:8} "System" game in the same mold as many of the heavier German games. However, this game is unusually simple from a systems standpoint. I don't see any potential for it to develop a nasty, brutal side, which can happen when a game like Puerto Rico or Euphrat & Tigris is played defensively. Its demeanor is closer to Amun-Re and The Princes of Florence, but with more speed, less system complexity, and a similarly huge amount of fun. ***UPDATE: Still surprised by the speed at which this game can be played. 4P game completed in just over one hour, with the players taking actions rapidly, almost simultaneously. My take on the expedition track/cards so far: NOT broken as designed. Players who max the track are no more likely to win than the players who max the taxation track or who take a balanced approach. However, you can't ignore it any more than you can ignore building or shipping in Puerto Rico. As in many auction games, the system self-balances once the players catch on to the strategies taken by the group. So far, excellent game, but I'm still not thinking top shelf. No lower than 8, could go higher depending on the strategies that reveal themselves. My group tending to bid fairly high for the tiles, cash in the system turn-to-turn tends to be low, despite a lot of taxation track development all around. It's also not as complex as, say, Puerto Rico, but there is a lot going on and there are many options. One observation I have is with the scoring, which seems to be rather even all around, and is ultimately broken by either the bonus tiles or the expedition cards. Seems like you need that "edge" to win, and those are the only two sources of the "edge" as the track scores develop fairly evenly for all players (assuming they know what they're doing) and everyone makes sure that they get all four colonies. Am sure that there is much more to discover here. *** UPDATE: Increased rating due to the novel economics going on here. The auction round is substantially deeper than it initially seems, primarily due to the money supply fluctuations caused by people buying their own stuff and generating new cash via taxation, tiles and exploration. It's like the closed-economy Traumfabrik auction, with sporadic injection and draining of resources. This adds a very important memory element to the game, which is very interesting as it is maddening, as the ability to corner the market in auctioned resources is very powerful. Really cool, extremely fun, and worth the price of admission in and of itself. (It's also an inflation / deflation lesson in an economics jargon-free environment, always a good thing for younger players!)

I have an extremely good impression of this game after my initial plays - it's very close to rating a 10 for me.  I wasn't sure about how different it would be from Caylus after hearing a lot of comparisons, but I would say it is definitely different enough to warrant buying if you already have Caylus.  I can't wait until I get a chance to play this again.  It has a similar flavor to Princes of Florence.  UPDATE: I'm putting it up half a notch.  It's now my favorite game that can be played well for 2 players.

This game is pretender to Puerto Rico's throne as the colonial trading game of choice; the depth is roughly similar to PR with a slightly more significant chance element in the form of the expedition cards.  Brilliantly put together game, seems to strike the right balance between choice and obligation as far as player actions are concerned and will probably surface more often than PR with our group.

Goa is a heavy game that combines the mobile bidding of Medici with the optimization of Princes of Florence.  The game components are of good quality and the rules are well explained.

Régóta szerettem volna kipróbálni, végre sikerült.
Elsőre kicsit ijesztőnek tűnika  táblán és környékén levő sok dolog, de végül a szabály egyáltalán nem volt bonyolult. Akár nem annyira gémereknek is simán tanítható, bár a licitáló játékokban azért mindig nagyon el lehet úszni, ha valaki nincs képben. A licit rész amúgy nagyon jópofa, tetszik a licitmegjelöléses ötlet. Az akciók már annyira nem villanyoztak fel, kicsit uncsiak érztem őket. Viszont jópofa, hogy a licitrészen igen nagy az interakció viszont utána akár lehet párhuzamosan is cselekedni, annyira szoliter. 

Ami tetszett: 
- a mechanizmus, 
- a játékhossz, 
- a nehézség
- pihentető, szórakoztató volt vele a játék. 

Ami viszont nem tetszett: 
- grafika, 
- jelölések nagyon nem egyértelműek (pl piros/fekete áthúzás), 
- kártyahúzás a kolonizáláshoz, teljesen játékidegen, felesleg szerencsét visz be, és elkerülni se egyszerű, mert kolonistát nem nagyon lehet szerezni
- kicsit nekem összeségében száraz, tematikátlan volt.

All those comments calling Goa a real brain burner confuse me a little. There are admittedly quite a few options to consider and the cute non-linear auction serves to spice things up a little but when you concentrate on what you want to get done the game really seems to be rather more straightforward than I expected.

The major factor contributing to the players' level of uncertainty somewhat surprisingly does not seem to be the auction but the expedition cards. They can provide considerable bonuses, certainly enough so to call for a change of plan, but they can also be pretty useless under the circumstances. As such they do feel a little out of place at first in a game where every single action counts. However, if you think about it, they quite likely add a necessary fuzziness to a game that otherwise would be almost fully predictable.

I'm not quite sure how I feel about that. The expeditions do seem swingy, and I wish the problem would have been solved in a different way, but I cannot think of a better one.

Goa is a great game. One of the games we play the most.

This game holds numerous options. Each tactic could be the winning one. And more importantly each player has a chance to win. Luck doesn't play a very big role with Goa.

It's isn't a very easy game to play. So you'll have to play Goa a couple of times before you'll get the hang of it.

Thoughtfullness is in orde, because each action (which actions are limited) counts.

GOA hat schon so viel Jahre auf dem Buckel, das es anderen Spielen etwas erzählen kann. Zum Beispiel von einer Zeit, in der das Gamers Game Qualitätsniveau, das GOA erreicht, noch nicht so verbreitet war. Hinzu kommt, dass GOA bei aller deutlich zu erkennenden Handschrift von Rüdiger Dorn mit seiner öfter verwendeten Spurversteigerung wie auch in HÄNDLER VON GENUA und DIAMONDS CLUB ein recht eigenwilliger Vertreter ist, der sich vermutlich tatsächlich nur noch mit Kreationen von Herrn Dorn selbst vergleichen lässt. GOA ist eine Art gekonnt zusammen geklebtes Spiel aus zwei Spieltypen. So prägen zwei ganz unterschiedlichen Hälften das Gewürzspielwerk: einen interaktiven Versteigerungsteil und einer Phase, in der jeder autistisch an seinem Entwicklungstableau herumdoktert, wo man in 5 Spalten thematisch bemüht in niederländischem, orangefarbenem Kolonialdrang Schiffbau, Ernte, Steuergelder, Expedition und Koloniegründungen verbessern kann. GOA war in seinen jungen Jahren und ist bis heute kein wirklich eingängiges Spiel, das durchaus mit Verzögerung Klick machen kann. Das kann im blödesten Fall 12 Jahre dauern wie bei mir. Das Einzige, das die Zeit nicht so recht mitgemacht hat ist die grafische Einbettung von Oliver Freudenreich, die heute staubtrocken daherkommt. Betrachtet man GOA als heutiges Kiffer- und Aussteigerparadies, dann geht's schon wieder.

The interesting part of the game is the first phase when the auctions occur.  The players set what will be bid in during a control sequences and then each player auctions off an item where they either take the money from the top bid or undercut the market but pay the bank.

The second part of the game is player execution in turning resources into advancement on 6 types of tracks which have standard eurogame victory points at the eod of the game depending on how far down the track you've been able to move.

Wow! Fantastic, fantastic game. Certainly one of my favourite auction and medium-weight economic games. The auction phase and then the upgrade/action phase work very well together. Though the action phase isn't so different than the usual "tight resources to spend on limited actions" system that is found in many Euro games, it works perfectly for what the game. Every decision is tense and maybe the auctions are the most tense I've played. Love it, love it.

I need to play this a few more times before I can truly substantiate any claims I make about this title, however after my first few plays I can't give it a very high score  Goa lacks any semblence of theme, and from first impression makes Puerto Rico (which I enjoy) seem a theme park of colonization.  The mechanics work well but it fell flat - it never built any moments of real tension.  I like auction mechanics, but usually have a problem with once arounds - especially in a two player game.  As aforementioned I am interested in playing this again. However, if Goa fails to blossom outside of it's micro management bud I can see the score dropping in the future.

UPDATE:  This game just doesn't click with me.

Goa is quite good, one of my favorite economic-engine building game right now.  The once-around auctions are the heart of the game and are even better and more tension-filled than the "action" phase - which is also interesting.  There are many options, tough choices and trade-offs - almost too many for some people.  But the planning horizon is limited by the frequent auctions (which provide you with additional options) so perfect calculation is only available over a relatively short horizon.  Even with this, some players will suffer bouts of analysis paralysis if they are prone to it.

This wonderful game of auctions & commerce take place in the early years of the Colonial era. It was a time when great risks could lead to greater fortunes! In your game room, great economic strategies & careful choices w/ your auctions might lead to victory, even if it's just by a whisker! One aspect that is rare, most players feel that it plays equally well w/ two, three, or four players. In addition, nearly 500 BGGers rate this a perfect TEN!

Good game, lots of decisions.  My one reservation is that the auction mechanic combined with the flag is not quite to my taste and creates some strange dynamics the way money is, for the most part, in a closed system, but changes hands in a way that creates imbalanced positions.  Not nearly as elegant, as say Traufambrik (Hollywood Blockbuster).  The tactical part of Goa is very good.

Pros : A rich and deep game in which the players must remain involved from the beginning to the end and perform every action available with utmost care. 

Cons : So well balanced and tight that no strategy can really be pursued : one must try to develop equally well in every category. Feels like playing an accountant.

Used to like it very much but now find it boring and often frustrating.

Goa is definitely an interesting game with lots of different aspects (I love the auction system and would like to see something similar implemented in other games), yet I'm not quite sure I'm enjoying it as much as I'd expect. The flow of the game seems bit confusing and lacks intuitiveness. My opinion might change if I get to play more, but at the moment it seems hard to convince anyone else to sit to the table. Confusing first play scares them off.

I played my second game of this with a couple experienced players and a newbie.  The experienced players pondered every single thing and came close to outrightly mocking some of my bids.

[b]Goa[/b] [i]Rudiger Dörn 2004[/i] 
Goa is a superb design that works like a swiss watch but has some minor drawbacks. First it is a bit cold, second new players, as happens with most auction complex games, can be quite lost in the first games. However, it has a neat bidding system, fast and clean, and loaded with interactivity and tactical chocies, a system I do love. The new version contains dice (for the colonization tries), but the deck of cards works well for me. So yes, it is somewhat cold, and quite abstract, but given its quality I couldnt care less about it: a keeper and an excellent rotation game with an extremily clever and fast auction mechanic.

Very very good non-confrontational auction-type game for two players.  Both my wife and I had a great time (she loves buying stuff).  Multiple plays and always wanting to play again.  Played a couple 3 player games, still brilliant in design.  45-60 mins.

A good resource management game. A drawback is that the single bid auction and tile-walking mechanic make this game much more dependent on seating order than most games, so it's harder to introduce new players or play in groups of differing abilities. Like all games that include auctions, the balance is dependent on players remembering the value curves of all the bits to bid on, so it's a better game with frequent play than occasional play.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Components: good board, good cards, good tiles
Complex: easy to learn
Weight: medium
Players: 3 or 4
Length: no more than 90 mins
Mechanics: bidding, tech tree development, hand management
Decisions: a lot, where to place the bids, where to bid, which path to follow...
Opinion: this is one of the first game entering my collection, and it is still a good one, no matter the time that has passed.
Lovely medium game to play to "relax" your grey cells, as they will be busy, but will not die :)
Probably is the best bid system I have seen out there, you have a grid of tiles, and you place your marker in one you want to be out for bidding (following adjacency with the ones previously selected by other players), and then make a one time bid in order, being the owner of the marker the last one. He has the option to accept the money bid or pay one more and take the tile (paying to the bank).
Then you have the rest of the game.... 8 turns, with 3 actions each. And, believe me, you do not have enough time to do all what you want. You have 5 techs to develop, and you can execute any of those paths.... should I go for ships (needed for develops), or should I go for spices (also needed for develops). No, I prefer going for money, used for bids, or for the amazing exploring cards....
The exploring cards, another thing I love about this game, small cards with 3 uses... you can use them for the bonus depicted, but you can keep them to the end game scoring, but, in the meantime, they are also used for the settlement of new colonies.
As already said, a medium weight game that I love since the first time I played, lot of tension and decisions, accurate length and lot of fun

The different tracks aren't equal and the tiles aren't either. Since it is auction game it isn't a problem with itself, but it leads to very similar strategies. The rest of the game is interesting in itself to make up for it.

A difficult game to rate because it scores big in a lot of categories but whiffs pretty hard in others. It's an engrossing thinking-man's game which demands repeat play (because if I just tweak that strategy a little bit...), but then it's also short on player interaction, it lacks drama, and it has absolutely no theme-to-mechanism relationship.

RATING: 7.5
2005 acquisition.  Really want to play this one.  First play 2008.

The game has fantastic components and a very good insert for the various tiles and cards.  The board is very well made and functional.  There are a lot of things to remember and it took us a while to get through the rules.  Once we got going however, it wasn't too bad.  It is a nice auction, resource management game.  The players first bid for various tiles sequentially selected by the players.  Once all the chosen tiles have been auctioned off, each player then has 3 (or more) actions, to try to do a number of things to found a colony, harvest, tax the locals, build ships, go on expeditions, or advance on the development board.  There are a lots of things to consider and a lot of things you may want to do but there is often an agonisingly limited number of action you can perform.

Can't wait to play this again.

Decent game, but if there was no auction/bidding there would be no player interaction at all. Still enjoyable.

edit: my initial rating was from 2005. In 2012 I played the new edition with slight rule changes. The game is now much easier, saying this, it is possible now (if you play well) to reach with each cube the end of your development track. In the earlier version, this was not possible. And imho this shouldn't be like that. A game should always be a challenge where you think 'next time I'll do better'. With the new edition, this is less the case.

An excellent game and very enjoyable. It suffers a bit, in my personal opinion, from some of the same issues as Princes of Florence (although I think it has improved upon them) by, in this case, focusing on a "control panel mechanism" (which emphasizes the players' agonizing over the long-term advancement of different elements in the "right" order) that has no interaction between players (which is important for me to have when I play a game). The clever bidding for interesting tiles is what makes this a great game instead of a frustrating puzzle.

I know this one is the classic, but I played the much later Steam Time first, and to me they seem like Dorn doing very much the same thing twice-- which of these color-coded tech tracks do you put your resources into?

Actually, most of the other Dorn games I've played (Las Vegas, Dragonheart, Istanbul) are more or less also about making you confront the danger of putting all your eggs in one basket. Only Asante (again, of the ones I've played) orients itself around something other than that particular tension.

So anyway, this seemed all right. I was glad the colors weren't interchangeable (i.e. because of the tech tracks, getting access to red spices supports a different set of strategies than getting white spices-- it's not Lords Of Waterdeep's "well, the right color of cube for your strategy is whatever's printed on the quest cards you have".

Great game that centers around the auctioning of tiles from the board to the players. The theme is familiar, trading goods (spices, in this case). You grow the goods yourself and then ship them back home (Portugal) to advance yourself down the "tech tree".

The game moves quickly, has a fixed length of 8 rounds, and avoids multi-player-solitaire via the auction every round (requiring you to actually speak with your fellow players). A fun, solid euro game of low-to-medium difficulty.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I think that the key to the game is in realizing that you get very, very few actions over the course of the game, choosing a strategy right from the start, and then doing everything you can to stay on track.  One slip at any point in the game can mean defeat.

First play in many years, so I tried to remember what it was I didn't like about it. The synergies are very subtle, and I think anyone's first game will be a learning experience. Also, the bidding values of tiles is very hard to determine without having played before. I respected the game, and I imagine my like of it would increase over time, but I don't really feel like bothering.

UPDATE - Played again after a couple of years. I liked it better. I think my last play was hampered by playing with very slow players. I liked it more, even though I'm clearly not very good at it.

It's a very solid design and I can see why some gamers love it, but while I enjoyed playing it, I thought it was very dry and abstract.

RATING: 7
A tight and nasty economics game that is too unfocused to be truly great.

The auction is a stroke of genius. It works fabulously with two. Playing with open money makes for a vicious game.

Sadly the rest of the game is lacking. As nerve racking as the auctions can be, the rather tame action rounds boil down to perfunctory maintenance of a generic economic snowball.

The expedition cards are kind of hokey, and add an unwelcome dose of luck to an otherwise pristine game of pure skill. I'm not opposed to luck in games generally, it's just implemented poorly here.

I'm also disenchanted with the Euro trope of special-power combos, though I'm inclined to give Goa a break due to its age.

The game just doesn't quite gel together, with the auctions feeling somehow disconnected from the rest of the game—even though what you're bidding on, and thus the pricing, is intimately tied to the rest of the game. I'm not totally sure where the feeling of disconnection comes from, but it's definitely there.

The theme is totally—and I mean [i]totally[/i]—pasted on. We could be anywhere, trading anything. This isn't a problem for me really—I mostly don't care about theme. It's just so blatant an example of pasted-on theme that it bears mentioning.

It's a well-designed and [i]strange[/i] game, and is worth playing—if not owning—just for that.

Euro medio-ligero que probablemente está bastante sobrevalorado.

Parte de un excelente diseño de mecánicas (subasta+árbol de desarrollo de tecnologías) pero también adolece de ciertos defectos, sobre todo en su primera versión.

Tras dos partidas y usando la versión corregida del reglamento, el juego mejora bastante con respecto al original (que estaba roto debido a que era posible explotar la mecánica de sacar cartas de exploración y hacer colección de símbolos para reventar el marcador) pero no carece de azar. Hay a quien esto pueda no molestar ni una pizca, pero no deja de ser chocante que un juego tan bien pensado como gestión de acciones y recursos pueda decidirse por la mala suerte en una carta.

En fin, si se está dispuesto a aceptar esto es posible disfrutar mucho del juego. Al fin y al cabo, tras unas cuantas partidas, pienso que el factor azar está bastante minimizado y no debería resultar un grave problema.

Too much fiddly things and needs too many plays to figure out how much each tile is worth in a specific situation to be really accessible for the casual player, which explains why it didn't win the SdJ 2004. Traded for E&T!

Joc de subastes de losetes a 3-4 jugadors, bastant abstracte. Funciona com un rellotge i és interessant de jugar, tot i que totes les partides s'assemblen entre si.
Molt estratégic, hi han molt poques accions durant la partida, això fa que una puja mal feta et pugui costar la partida. Molt difícil de remuntar si vas enrere en el marcador.

My initial impression of this game was Wow! amazing. As I played on and in subsequent plays i ma getting the feeling that the end game is lacking, the game almost feels like it builds down rather than builds up. 

You can easily end up with most if not all of your last two or more rounds pre planned (within reason).

The start is good, the early mid game is great the end ......

Still happy to play but I was also happy to sell my copy before I had actually played with it. I will probably buy it again. I bought and sold another copy without playing my copy and eventually aquired a copy in trade.

A tightly designed auction and action game.  The theme is weak, ther interaction is minimal (the auctions are pretty constrained) and it is super dry.  Therea are a few different strategies you can take but none of them really feel that different and ultimately you remain at the whim of card draws and auctions you have little control over.  Probably a good game if you are into the low interaction  style of eurogames but not really my thing.  I only really like those games when you are building something interesting and Goa doesn't hit that area at all. Takes 90 minutes or so, too long for a game with such a small amount of meat on its bones.

One of the better pure Euros. The auction phase is the important part and trickiest to learn. Works well with 2 or 3. Card draws can be very important to success, but that level of luck is acceptable for this type of game. Spice bag bits and orange box are very nice. Spreadsheet.

Tentative rating after one play. I really liked the auction element, both in they way things are put up for bid and in how the bidding process works. The economic aspect seemed a bit banal, though. Seems to scale pretty well within the admittedly small player range though. 2-player auction games don't always work so neatly.

I like this game because it is continually a game of limited resources and tradeoffs.  However, I don't like how the luck of the draw in expedition cards can change the game so completely.  People who draw more "advance down a track with spices only" or even "advance down a track with ships only" get a huge advantage over those who don't get these cards.  I try to play so as to cycle through lots of expedition cards in a game, but a lot of bad luck can still happen.  (Oh, and the randomness of the cards can also screw people if they try to go for a colony and miss because the expedition card total is too small... ouch!)

Game of Action maximization/management.  Essentially everyone is using resources (Spice, Ships and Colonists) to upgrade different aspect of his/her company, or colonize the four islands.  It is mostly a game of upgrades, where everything is intertwined.

Player interaction limited to the auction phase, and the board serves little purpose other than as a place holder for the cards...

Still, it can be an enjoyable experience with the right crowd.

RATING: 7
Tech trees? Resource procurement and conversion? Economy-building? And spatial auctions? Where do I sign up? This game has a lot of the traditional Euro tropes, blends them incredibly smoothly and adds a fine spice through the spatial mechanic for auctioning. We had already seen this mechanic in Traders of Genoa and would see it again in Louis XIV (together in what I would call Dorn's "trailing tower trilogy") but it seems most brilliant here with auctions as auctions are usually more discreet and less relational spatially (i.e., there isn't always a spatial relationship between what is auctioned). Above and beyond this, this game doesn't do anything screemingly innovative (even for its time) but it does it all so well (and still does it so well to this day).

While I agree that the the exploration cards can be powerful, the game balances out when it is understood by all players the degree to which they can be a make or break risk (which seems counter-intuitive in a game that otherwise plays like clockwork -- but this is a positive feature and not a flaw).

[Initial Impression: 9]
Just a fantastic auction and resource management game, made all the better that it works well with 2 players as well as 3 or 4. It's incredibly strategic, all the way from where to place the flag, to how much to pay in each auction, to which actions to take in which order. Even though you're working on your own advancement tracks, it is important to keep an eye on how your opponents are advancing - if they beat you down certain tracks, they will get the bonus card you were hoping for, and you can block them from successfully completing certain actions by buying tiles that they clearly need (or at least make them pay a lot at auction for them). Because the auction is once around, it is important to consider your bid carefully for each item, and don't make the mistake of allowing an opponent to scoop up a bargain. Be sure to always keep in mind that the aim is to earn victory points, which you'll primarily earn by carrying out actions - don't underestimate the value of free actions (including that won with the flag auction). Lots of people overvalue the expedition card track - it is very possible to win without relying on these cards (if your opponent is concentrating on the expedition track, you can block their access to extra actions and to the plantations they need to advance that track during the auction). It takes some time to learn all the tiles, how to value them, and to understand the interplay of the various development tracks, but once you learn it, Goa is an incredibly rich and strategy-laden experience.

We have now given the game a few solid plays.  It definitely suffers from some complex rules and a fairly cumbersome setup process.  I don't know why, but we keep having a situation where I win the game by a decent margin, but only after 6 of the 8 rounds go by and we seem more or less even.

I suspect it is a stronger game with more than two players.

-----------
Only one play so far, and it was a bit of a struggle through some complex rules.

Challenges for a new player:
1. Auctioning is hard when you don't have a good sense of the relaive value of the various pieces.
2. Rulebook is not very well written... Encourage all new players to read the example on the last two pages before reading the actual rules.
3. Extra action card rules are buried on the 8th page or so.  very confusing.
4. Exploration cards cleverly adapt to three roles (end game points, opportunity to take special actions and random element when building colonies), but this mix of uses is very confusing at first.

That all said, the game seems to offer various ways to win.  You can focus on moving the grey cubes down the card for end game victory points, or you can focus on getting the most colonies, or you can focus on getting the tiles worth points directly.  But, to win, you need to do more than one thing, although not necessarilly all of these things.

Look forward to another try.  Feels like a mix of Alhambra and Settlers of Catan... (Auctioning like trading in catan, building settlements and multiple avenues to win like catan, tile style and payment system kind of like Alhambra.)

RATING: 7.5
Goa is an awesome auction game, with multiple paths to victory, and truly varying values to the various commodities being auctioned.

At the bottom of it, there are two rounds (A/B) each with 27 posssible choices, only 25 of which are visible, and only 20 of these will actually be auctioned. This ensures both some options, and variable commodities in games to keep the action fresh. (Note: In a 4-player game- all these choices are reduced with smaller numbers of players)

Each player chooses (1) tile to uaction, and the start player chooses a 2nd, making 5 total auctions.  These can provide plantations for harvest and advancement, or other usful commodities, such as Settlers or Ships, or vital additional Actions.  The winner of the 1st auction also gets to be start player in the next round, and takes an additional action - two potentially very useful assets.

After the auctions, each player gets (3) actions to harvest, advance, collect resources, or try to found colonies in the Spice Islands. There are rarely enough actions available, even with extra actions.

Players advance on (5) Technology Trees, each of which enhance your overall abilities, and capability to succeed in different ways.

I am very glad I won this in geeklist auction- it was truly a "game I didn't know I needed;" and I DID need this one.

Rated 7.5 based on a 1st solo 4-player session.

Raised to an 8 after the 2nd 4 player solo game- felt tight, and tremendous.

The game is great ... but has a luck factor which can be a bit frustrating (drawing cards when buying colonies). But, the following variant helps out: Not matter what you draw, you always have at least additional three colonists. 
The ranking of the game is according to this variant.

I really like Rudiger Dorn's designs.

This game is great, due to the tight auction placement and multiple strategies to pursue.

It can at times feel a little staid, though.

My review on 26 March 2007:
http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/158277

Since the review, this game has seen less playing time, mainly due to the fact that our group is entering a more direct-conflict gaming phase. 

Consequently the score has decreased in relation to willigness to play.  I still think the mechanics of the game are excellent, and potentially the score will climb by a point or two again in the future.

(11/13/2010) Wow... this is an impressive design that has interesting choices, engaging theme, and is FUN to play.

It has a resource generation mechanic similar to Puerto Rico where plantations generate spice crops. Spice and shipping are needed to upgrade capabilities in five areas: more shipping, growing more spice, generating more cash, the ability to "explore" through exploration cards, and ability to claim colonies through greater number of colonists. VP are awarded on how much progress is made in each of the five areas.

The game consists of 8x rounds, where each round starts with a bidding phase, followed by 3x actions. The bidding is a truly novel mechanic where players place bid tokens in turn order from 1 to 5 on a 5x5 grid of tiles. The starting player determines where on the grid the next player may place a bid token on a tile (to temporarily "claim" it) adjacent to the start location, and subsequent players can place bid tokens adjacent to the last bid location. Players then bid once around for the next start player, and then for each of the remaining 4 tiles. The twist is that the winning bid is paid to the player who "claimed" the specific tile, sort of like Modern Art. The player who claimed the tile has the option to overbid the last player, where the bid is then paid to the bank. In this manner, players can generate income from the selling of tiles, which may represent all sorts of goodies: new plantations, action cards, ship cards, or additional colonists.

After bidding, all players take 3x actions in sequence, either making progress in one of the five areas, or getting more ship cards, planting (or harvesting, as the game says) more spice, extracting income, gaining exploration cards, or attempting to establish new colonies, which give more flexibility in spice production (Variety is the "spice" of life, and spice variety is crucial to making progress on the five areas).

There are other things to consider, such as attempting to gain "action" cards and exploration cards. Action cards are important, since normally there are only 24x actions per player in the entire game; additional actions are therefore advantageous. Exploration cards give random items, but may give a significant advantage at a critical moment in the game; they should not be ignored, as they are like "prestige" cards from Princes of Florence.

All in all, this is another solid game from Alea, which also brought you POF and PR. The rules are somewhat poorly organized, however (for example: how exploration cards are played and limited is explained in three different sections of the rulebook). Otherwise, everything is tight, and everything makes sense. A solid game, and I can't wait to play it again. Too bad it is OOP, but I hear a reprint is in the works! Initial rating a '9'.

Update (06/01/2012) 3 plays: First play after buying OOP copy from a friend. I had forgotten how nerve-wracking this game is, as it seems like every move I make is a mistake! Determining the optimum bid during the auctions is intense, as is the squeezing as much efficiency from the limited number of actions. I'll need several more plays to be comfortable. The initial buzz is gone, but it is settling to a solid '8'.

Update (02/02/2014) 5 plays: I've stayed away from this game for awhile, as I don't like how I feel after a game. This 5th play was no exception. I never have a clear idea of what certain items are worth during the initial auctions. After that, it is just a variation of collecting resources, converting them into "stuff", and slowing accumulating VP along the way. There are so many ways to go about this, but there is so little time. Thus, every action card is precious. Winning the "flag" and extra action is significant, as the player has the opportunity to profit off of two bids next turn. There is still a period of unfamiliarity that I am wading through. There is a great game here, but I still cannot figure it out. Holding at an "8".

I'm not sure about this one yet, but I certainly would like to play again. I found myself getting annoyed at the once-around auctions, but know that it probably takes 30-60 minutes off the play time as opposed to open auctions (and adds a depth of strategy). It also has the old style euro mechanic of draw a few cards and keep one or two of them which I never really like.

I really enjoy the tactical nature of the game and how your strategy has to evolve around what tiles you win during the first few rounds. The fly by the seat of your pants nature of the beginning of the game is really exciting. I'm worried that this sense burns out toward the end of the game though.

Goa is my kind of game.  There is so much depth and thought required.  I love the fact that there are two sub-games involved - the auction phase and the development phase.  Like many good games, there is so much to do and so few actions or money to do it with.  This game forces difficult decisions.  Fun, fun, fun.  I picked Goa for my first microbadge.

Interesting game.  The auctions are where the player interactions really come into play.  You can suffer somewhat for other's bad decisions - for example, if the player to your left just loves to buy out his own auction he can take you out of the running along with himself.  Also, one of the developments (expeditions) does seem a bit strong.  It is hard to imagine winning without progressing that heavily, since the cards make up too many points at the end.  But I'm definitely willing to give it more tries to see what strategies are viable.

An auction plus engine game. Most of the interest lies in the auction: deciding where to place the flag and which item to offer for sale. After that, it's really just a game of eking out small advantages to get slightly ahead in the scoring, although there is a bit of luck in founding colonies and which exploration cards you get. It's better than Princes of Florence in that auction items are much closer in value, there's no 'must have' item like PoF's jester, but the connection between theme and mechanism is weaker than in Puerto Rico. It's a little lacking in tension or excitement, there's no scoring track or VP chit pile to give a sense of who's ahead, but this is still much better than more recent Euros and playing it again recently was a breath of fresh air.

Excellent. I'd describe it as "efficient".. each action you take must benefit you as much as possible, BOTH in the long and the short term, and you have very few actions allowed to you.  Since value is very dynamic due to the tech tracks and when things come up, there is always some question as to what things are worth. Lots to think about here. 

After several plays it's become a little more manageable to me and I'm just liking it better and better. Even if you are pretty flush with resources, there's always something more you need to attend to to get where you need to be.

Yes it feels like each player is playing on their own as their is no direct competition, but the auction phase is very strategic and involves everyone.  After that, your on your own, but I find it very engaging and always a pleasure to play.  Still can't get the point of holding cards at the end, but I probably need to play the game a bit more to refine my strategies to include holding cards for end-game VP's

Gestión de recursos que se explica en unos 20 minutos y es bueno para los iniciados que buscan algo más. El objetivo es desarrollar, de manera muy abstracta, tu negocio de exportación de especias durante la época colonial portuguesa en la isla de Goa. Posee algo de "solitario multijugador" que se ve compensado con la fase interactiva de la subasta, con la dosis justa de interacción sin que llegue a ser agresiva. Al igual que en otros grandes juegos "hay muchas cosas que hacer pero pocas acciones o dinero para lograrlo". Además, es bueno para 2 jugadores. CONTRAS: puedes necesitar más de una partida para encontrarle sentido, tema pegado, suerte en forma de cartas.

[ENG]

Resource management that can be explained in less than twenty minutes. Good for people who are looking for more after a gateway game. The main goal is developing (in a quite abstract way) a spice export business in the colonial portuguese era of Goa´s island. It has a bit of "solitaire multiplayer" game balanced by the interactive auction phase,that gives a bit of non-aggresive interaction. There are a lot of things to do but you dont have enough money or time to do it. Further, the game is good for 2 players. CONS: You might need more than one game to understand the whole mechanism. Pasted theme. Luck (in card variety form).

I would probobly give this game a 9 if I didnt have to keep looking up what all the tiles and cards do? There is still debate in our group over some of the rules.A really superb game of action managment. 

I now feel there is a bit too much solo play in this, I still like it - but I never get to play it as too many feel it too dry.

The bidding evaluation is at the sweet spot, which makes the game shine. It will be much better if rules can be a little easier(Say, from BGG weight 3.4 to 3), but it's fine. Also, one needs a game or two to get the feeling on numbers.

First played May 16th, 2007.  This will take a while (20 minutes) to go over the rules.  It will also take a while to play (90 min is pushing it; more like 2 hrs for the first game).  With that being said, it's worth it.  After two hours gone by, I enjoyed it and still wanted to play it longer.  It has a great mix of luck and strategy.  There are so many options and straties to go for that it could take many game plays to figure out or master what exactly your gameplan should be.  I would definetly recommend giving this a game play and strong consideration into your games to play on a regular basis.

Goa offers a lot of fun. The game system and the theme are fully harmonized. Auctions, resource management and city developement are also intimately connected each other. However, one of tactics, which is called "Special Card Tactics", is too much powerful. It ruins its balance of the game. The collapse of balance weakens the replayablility of the game and other various strategic approach.

I haven't finished a game, but it was definitely a great game that left me much to think about afterwards. The two related but somewhat distinct elements--the auction and then the action sequence--make for a lot to think about and open multiple paths. The auction provides one kind of tension while promising very different game play each time as we weave our way through a different path. The other aspect, managing the resources and fulfilling a strategy, afforded interesting decisions each round. I imagine the rating would improve with more plays.

I'm enjoying Goa more with each play. The theme is rather hackneyed but the mechanics of the game - particularly the auction - are interesting enough to make up for this. There are a lot of interacting elements to the game, and they seem to be fairly well-balanced. The only drawback for me is that player interaction is limited to the auction. UPDATE: played again for the first time in more than 3 years and enjoyed the game very much.

This one plays you, not you it.  Only one winning strategy.  Way too long for the minimal satisfaction you get out of it.

* I HATE the new edition.  It messes up with rules, tiles and introduces new ones (graphically inconsistent and I have doubts about their balance).  All this fuss and confusion and agreeing the set of rules to be applied before the game is COMPLETELY unneccessary :-//  The original edition worked perfectly fine...

** Starting with 2 steps already on developments tracks already makes the game too easy :-/  I'm not going to use this variant ever again!

This reminds me of Puerto Rico, Princes of Florence and RA actually. Why RA, the importance of knowing the worth of what items are up for bid, also the items are worth different amounts to different people, these two things stand out for me plus you have the once around type of auctions as well. The multiplayer solitarie complaint is slightly overrated, lots of interaction in the auctions and you need to be watching what each individual is doing as well, kinda like PR. The fact this scales so well from 2 - 4 is another big bonus in my book. Another big thing that stands out in this game is there are so many things you need to do and never enough actions to do them, all this and the multiple paths giving you lots of strategies to explore really make it a great game.

Vrij strategische topklassieker waarin je kolonies moet stichten en specerijen verschepen naar de oude wereld. Het spel duurt 8 ronden, met per ronde een veiling- en een actiefase. In de veilingfase worden door de verschillende spelers tegels geveild met plantages, terugkerende voordelen, of eenmalige voordelen. Dan kan elke speler een actie doen tot elk er 3 heeft gedaan. Acties zijn o.a. goud nemen, specerijen produceren, op expeditie gaan,... of op het waardetableau een blokje doorschuiven. Wie het meeste punten heeft, wint. Zelf vind ik dit een uitstekend spel; Ward vond het minder, Anneken vond het redelijk.

I really enjoyed how the auctions worked, and I liked the idea of upgrading your personal actions, but I ultimately felt like the entirety of the non-auction part of the game was pretty straightforward, and the auctions weren't quite enough to carry the game on their own.

This quickly become one of my favorites but my desire to play has tarnished a bit over time. It's complex and hard to teach but in the end it's not all that difficult. The abstractness of the game starts to show through after a few plays which bumps it down a notch for me. Yes, it does have a slight solitaire aspect, but that's a blessing when playing with certain people anyway! This game had me thinking about stategies more than another game in 2004. My personal game of the year for 2004!

A brilliantt game of resource management between Puerto Rico and Princes of Florence. Auction system is clever for it is fast but need careful judgement about tile values and strategy adopted. Furthermore players can inflate or deflate currency with their actions and this is very important. Player interaction is limited to the auction phase similar to Princes of Florence. Played many times and still evalueting different strategies. Cards can seem too powerful, but my experience is that the game is very well balanced. There is not just one winning path.

I'm not convinced that the card drawing is unbeatable.  It's strong for sure, but I've been preferring a mixture where I go for the cards late in the game.  By then, I should be able to upgrade quickly, get in some drawing, and reach the 5th/6th rank on some columns for the extra cards.

RATING: 8
With 2 I can't help feeling the auction mechanic isn't fun, twice around or not starting at zero might have worked better (but I'm probably missing something clever there). 2 can also suffer easily with a runaway money issue - without auction money, even for one turn, a smart opponent can lock you out of the game significantly. 

4 players works better - although often I have a somewhat dry time of it and think it's dying on it's feet but then everybody afterwards says that they really enjoyed it. One of those kind of games - it's satisfying decision making, but there's little direct interaction between players.

First off, I'll have to say that on the surface Goa has everything I enjoy in a heavy German game: Auctions, many roads to victory, turn angst, and a cool theme to boot. For a German game, it's quite complex (even compared with other heavyweights) and feels most of all like a mix of Puerto Rico, Amun-Re and Princes of Florence. Like Princes, every round consists of auctions for common resources, followed by individual actions by each player. "Money" (ie. spendable resources) come in many flavors, including dubloons, colonists, ships, and spice sacks. Add to this a healthy handful of different tiles, a deck of many different cards, and about 6 or 7 different ways to score points at the end of the game, and you've got an incredibly meaty game.

Despite my enthusiasm for "those kinds" of games, I am not ecstatic about Goa: The theme (while cool) is almost non-existant and Goa really feels abstract in a way Puerto Rico or Amun-Re don't. In addition, a few of the more random game mechanics (drawing cards to colonize, getting VP for sets of expedition cards at the end) don't fit well with the rest of the game's uber-heavy feel.

So overall, I find Goa to be a fine game, if lacking a bit of the soul which makes other heavyweights (eg. Puerto Rico, Amun-Re, E&T) the classics they are.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
While the game is good, there did not seem to be anything original about it.  There are multiple worker tracks that players can advance.  The choice of items available in the middle through turn order was the most original idea that I was able to see, but the following auctions were often not as compelling as I thought they would be.  Overall, it is an auction game with choices of advancementand resource management.

Brilliant.

Auctions create tension - will player B select what he knows I need because he knows I will pay him a lot of money for it, or would he prefer to screw me over?

Auction tile placements create tension.

Building your engine isn't overly difficult, but there's enough to it that you need to take risks sometimes, make a few small reaches if you're going to be able to win the game.  It takes some planning to get there - usually 2/3 of my actions are pretty well scripted, and the third one can usually be used on a whim.

Triangular scoring rewards specialization, but specialization makes it harder to advance, so the best result seems to be towards slight specialization to maximize score, but some balance to maximize efficiency.  This helps games play out very differently.

This based on one play.  I found it kind of dry, although I could tell it was well designed.  It seemed a little abstract and almost spreadsheet like in the player mat.  The auctions seem kind of non auction in the fact that the last player can buy at a discount.  I guess the only reason is to be able to manipulate what people purchase tiles for instead of straight purchasing.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (May 2012)

After 1 play I think this is a very good game, every decision is meaningful. In particular the auction mechanic is brilliant.

The game has simple rules but don´t let this fool you. It is a medium heavy game with lots of hard decisions and tension until the very end. It plays quickly so you don’t feel any downtime.

I don´t like the theme but the gameplay is too good to pass.

I believe the rating will go up with more plays and I can´t wait to play again.

I continue to like Goa, however I feel the cards are too unbalanced (in power and in scoring) and, ultimately, add a lot of unwanted luck onto the mix. For now I would play again, but I´m downgrading its rating to a 6.5

I love anything with a tech tree.  Goa is in part an auction game, and the other part is an optimization exercise that provides the basis for evaluating the auctioned items.  The genius of the game is the closed economy, with limited opportunities to inflate or deflate the currency.  If there is a secret to playing Goa well, it is keeping track of the inflationary/deflationary events.  A player who is tracking those events well will score great deals in the marketplace and ride those deals to a decisive advantage in the final scoring.

Requires a few plays to really enjoy, as it takes a while to figure out how to value tiles properly.  This is one of those games that plays far better if all players are near the same experience level, which isn't always possible.  In fact the newbie binding seems so deterministic that I'm much less willing than I used to be to play with a newbie whom I don't think will be interested in making it up the learning curve eventually.

I do wish the cards weren't so powerful, though of course an auction game does self-balance to an extent.

Played it twice.  This game is complex, but in a very entertaining way.  As Raife said, "A game where you want to do everything, but can't . . . nifty!"  I still haven't figured out how to manage the resources yet, but I like this game enough to keep trying.  
Update 6/17:  Played a 3-player game where the outcome was demonstrably effected by the "luck of the draw" in the Expedition cards (whilst being used to resupply and found colonies).  Made me drop the rating one.  Want to play again to see if this is really a consistent problem.  I don't mind a fair bit of luck in a 45 minute game, but in a 2 hour one?  No thanks.

Interesting system to figure out how much each of the tiles are worth during the bidding phase.

I think you need 4 to balance out the movement of the cash.

Wow.  A little long, but that will change with experience.  Very nicely put together.  So many (SO many) things to do, and so few actions.

Yet another Euro with a whole bunch of processes intertwined with an auction phase. The spatial aspect of the auction (you can only put up an item that is adjacent to the previously auctioned tile) is a twist I hadn't seen before. 

Not much in the way of thrills, this is definitely a game played largely in silence. One game isn't nearly enough to explore all the possible strategies, but I know my tastes well enough to file this one under "Not My Style." Still, I'd play it again.

A game rife with challenging decisions. I think of this as the book-definition of a Eurogame. The only luck is in the tile draw, but the bidding mitigates it. Every choice affects every subsequent choice, as each game element intricately depends on one another for advancement. Every turn you are left wanting to do more than you are allowed. I'll play this anytime.

My only criticism would be that the mechanics are almost TOO obvious, which can make the game feel a little mechanical at times, but it doesn't detract from my enjoyment.

Esperaba más de este juego.

Tiene dos fases distintas, la fase de subasta y la fase de acciones. Los jugadores pujan por las losetas en la fase de subasta y colocan las que ganan en sus tableros. En esta fase hay un poco de interactividad.

Por otro lado, en la fase de acciones cada jugador tiene 3 acciones, basadas en el progreso de su tablero. Y aquí está el problema, me temo. Este juego te obliga a estar muy centrado en tu propio tablero, y en la segunda fase no hay interactividad.

Es un juego muy parecido a Los Principes de Florencia, pero no tan bueno como éste.

I was expecting more from this game.

It has two different phases, one auction phase and one action phase. Players bid for tiles in the auction phase, putting their won tiles at their own board. There is a little bit of interactivity in this phase.

On the other hand, in the action phase each player has 3 actions, based on the progress of their own boards. And here is the problem, I guess. This game forces you to be very focus on your own board, and in the second phase there is no interactivity.

It is a game very similar to The Princes of Florence, but not so good as it.[/color]

     The only thing that keeps this from being a 10 is that the card track is over powered, but with reasonable players this is offset in the auction phase.  I love the auctions, the tech trees, the planning.  The auction placement mechanic keeps each game just enough different that you can't follow any one route every time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Marvelous game - very abstract.  I think the technology development is what does it for me - increasing abilities in the different areas with intense competition during the game, and the way it integrates with the other game mechanics.  The main board may put people off as it is so abstract - and my first reaction was such, but once the play started it has enough flavour to make the theme stick, and I just love the little spice bags.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
While the game itself is solid, I found the theme pasted on. The auction phase is the only player interaction and the point scoring is relatively tight. While the game didn't win me over completely, I wasn't dissappointed by the experience either.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Goa is always a little anticlimactic. The subtleties and unique qualities of the auction are enough to set Goa apart - way apart. But at the end of the game I always score within a narrow point range, and even if my tech trees vary a bit, the end product feels too similar. Goa has the intense pressure for action efficiency that sours me on Agricola, but at least it keeps the rhythm even. Goa may also be one of the most unforgiving games I can think of. Making a mistake feels very rigid, as though your best possible outcome is now irrevocably worse than it was before you made the mistake.  

Update: I love the auction, but sometimes the game around it just bugs me. Managing 5 generic bottlenecks with 24 actions can feel tedious, but then, there are sessions where the cards and inflation add a sort of outrageous giddy quality to it all, which is weird. On the one hand, the cards often feel too random. On the other hand, the game badly needs them. 

2nd Update: I've decided that it's not just the excellent auction but the expedition cards as well that give this game substance. Maybe that makes me extraordinarily slow to catch on. The actual infrastructure part of the game is just plain bad on its own. A sizable number of Goa players object to the expedition cards as overpowered - essentially creating a single path to victory. I'd go them one further and say that leaning on the cards is not only crucial to success to required for the game to be any fun. The cards give you tangible short term goals, a clear head during the auctions, and much needed shortcuts as you improve your score. So the question is: will skilled players be following similar paths every game, and if so, does it matter? A score of 42-60 can win (usually, more like 45-50). Almost every score in that range will have four of six (counting the colonies) infrastructure tracks maxed out. So it's not really a question of which tracks you go into, but in which order. I think the even-handed approach is largely doomed to failure. Instead, an expedition foothold at level two seems like the standard opening. From there, perhaps anything is viable, but the shipping and taxes tracks seem significantly weaker than the harvest and colony tracks. The harvest track combines extremely well with the expedition track, because you can leverage it a couple of different ways for massive upgrades, sometimes using it to make up for a neglected shipping track. There is no way to do the same thing with the shipping track. You can also use the harvest/expedition combo for one or two large influxes of cash, making the tax track questionable. I suppose you could go into the tax track to double up on money and then buy your way up the colonize track. Either way, harvest/expedition seems flat-out better than any other core strategy. 

Despite that, there are still couple of game layers that can be played any number of ways. Extra actions? Mission VPs? Most Money? Espionage? Is the Auction enough to allow for different playstyles? Would the game be better if taxes/shipping were stronger and if bad luck on colonizing weren't as jarring? Or would it just feel easier? And if it just felt easier does that mean the game isn't interactive enough? I don't have the answers to these questions. At times they feel largely theoretical... the occasional game of Goa can be both lively and satisfying.

There is an auction phase in which you can buy various cards. Many of these are used to produce goods on that player's plantation board. Another option is to colonize which also builds up the plantation. Then players have a chance to take three actions. Items from the plantation can be used to advance any of five tracks. Also ship cards are needed to advance along these tracks. As the tracks advance more resources can be generated such as ship cards by using an action. The victory points are mainly from how far advanced are the tracks and how far along are the colonized plantations.

Entertaining game to be played with more serious Eurogamers. Auction mechanics means it takes a couple of plays to get the "hang" of it (as you need to be able to start valuing what comes up for auction). Winning strategy seems to be to balance all development tracks while trying to get what you need from auctions as cheaply as possible (and this requires counting/guessing who has what money left at any point in time ...)

RATING: 8.5
Just barely makes an 8.  While I love the entire economic system, the game is a bit dry and brain-burny.  It has some spirit in common with Puerto Rico, with the notable lack of the engaging player interaction that comes from the choice of roles.  I am not sure that there is enough "surprise" circumstance in the game that would force a player to alter his initial plans and adapt to current conditions.  If this proves true, then replayability will suffer.

Edit:
I see that I've upgraded my rating.  There is a lot of solotaire in the game, it's true, but after repeated playing I've come to appreciate the variability injected by the crucial auction rounds.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The auctions are the only source of player interaction (almost true).  The action phase of the game drags on, in a four player game we started taking our actions simultaneously, this worked well but really reinforces the multi-player solitaire.  It might be better with two, time will tell.

Finally bought this from the FLGS after coveting it for many years.  After only 4 plays I can see why it has maintained its position in the top 50 here on the Geek!  It scratches all the same itches as Puerto Rico, Agricola, Stone Age, etc, but with much more player interaction.  The game changes so drastically from round to round and you can't guarantee you'll get the plantation tile you were hoping for.  I feel like this will need many many more plays to truly explore all of the strategies available.  A solid game and great as a two-player as well.

RATING: 6
Two plays in and I'm not convinced. I would have to spend more time/plays on Goa to see if it takes the Saint Petersburg way and gets enjoyable once I've got down the basics or the Stone Age / Yspahan way that I don't find the strategies interesting enough. As there's no online implementation the question probably won't be answered.
The issue is that I'm mostly not interested in learning the generic strategies for success, applying them again and again while only varying them in detail between plays. In Goa, the exploration cards seem to be one strategy which must be followed and colonies are mandatory as well. Focussing on money on the other hand is suboptimal at best. There's enough randomness in the exploration cards and the establishment of colonies as well as player interaction in the bidding phase to add interplay variety but at the same time the potential for frustration is raised by the random factor.
When it comes to classic gamers eurogames I rather go for the Knizia ones.

Very cool experience for those that like efficiency engine games.  It is very difficult to correctly value everything, and the fact that all of the auctions are only once around makes valuation very important.

Though I guess an experienced group could make sure that one strategy doesn't become too dominant.

Goa is really a great game. It has a sizeable level of complexity and the cards and tiles hold a significant number of easily missunderstood rules. The premise and theme of the game are interesting and are well incorporated into the great artwork. The auctioning system makes for some deliciously difficult decisions and is the crux of the player interaction. For some this might seem a little too solitaire but I feel with experience it will hold great value. I can see this game holding a longlasting respected position in my collection. Losing position to games with more clear rules and more viable strategies (and less luck).

Lots of strategic and tactical thinking going on all the time. However, the gameplay could almost be done as a multiplayer solitaire, so you don't have to mind yourself too much with others' doings save the auction phase, which is sad. Also, once you have fallen a little behind, you'll most probably never recover, no matter what you do. And this game always feels to me like it is taking a too long time to play in relation what's actually happening, so when you're clearly behind the game becomes utterly boring. Also the amount of luck is surprisingly high. This game has huge potential anyway and learning everything takes a lot of time and playing.

Goa is good but I need to play it more to be sure of how good. It seems to be very solitaire like and I am not sure the auction provides sufficient interaction.

It seems a bit on the long side but I now am convinced that it merits its place in my small collection.

I love the pure optimization chain: how can I reach my goal in as few steps as possible, with as little waste as I can? It requires you to think 5-6 actions in a row, which leads to a very fast pace.

This game is simply amazing, the auctions are interesting, the choice of actions to take is often deliciously painful, and you never feel like you have quite enough of them.  I love this game!

edit: A couple years later, Still awesome!

There is a lot to do in this game.   This game has an auction phase and an actions phase similar to Princes of Florence.  Most people that play this game have said that it 'feels' more like Puerto Rico though.  The auction is interesting and fun and after people have played this game a couple of times, the actions phase moves pretty quickly.  It is a very intriguing game.  I would suggest this as a must have for serious gamers.

Proper rule on Expedition track is a MUST or game fractures. The auction is why Goa>PoF. In PoF, ppl have made reasonable estimations as to how much a jester is worth on round 3. This type of specialized knowledge is a death knell (for me). In Goa, no such analysis may be done since it depends on how inflationary (money track actions, payments to other players) or deflationary (payments to the bank) the particular game has been. Advancing the Expedition track makes that player's game chaotic, but it can be a powerful option. The randomness of successfully founding a colony is not infrequently unbalancing in a given game... hence, not a 9.

A building game.

Good: Wonderful and deep strategy game. Many different options and strategies to choose from. Each player has a matrix board with 6 columns of different strategies that can be advanced in any order. Rules are some of the simplest I have ever seen for a heavy strategy game.

Bad: Takes 3 hours. However, typically you are so immersed in the game that the time just flies by. I am not a fan of the expedition cards, as I feel they bring too much luck into the game.
The bidding can create problems - it takes time to develop a feel for the value of the cards. Therefore anyone newer to the game can accidentally give things away to another player.

Probably my favorite serious auction game, with Hollywood Blockbuster being my favorite, new player friendly, fun one.I enjoy the ability to hose an opponent based on not only auctioning, but the spatial placement of the auction start piece.Great game, though a bit fiddly on setup and break down which is going to cost it .5 point.

Scales 2-4, so it gets the .5 point back.

I use to own this, played it at least a couple time, but remember next to nothing about it.  Doesn't help that it has a forgettable look to it as well.

Acquired in 2006. Total number of plays = 5. Would like to play more and explore the intricacies of the game. Seems to still take about 2 hours (which is a little long for the fact that the game seems to end somewhat abruptly). Not impressed with the not-so-smooth card quality of the reprint. I think my rating will go up with several more plays since I feel this is a solid design, and I find it a very engaging game.

Liking the game more recently as I understand the interactions between the paths.  Since it is an auction game, I also like the fact that I am beginning to understand appropriate valuations.  Game is quick, but feels meaty.  I really like the auction mechanic where one player is the auctioneer and gets the money, and therefore is probably not in a position to buy his own item.

Combination of an auction, action and exploration game. So many choices and options ... maximising some of the tracks or trying a balanced approach. There are many roads to victory, but don't forget the expedition cards as these might just make the difference in the end. ***** Reminder: mistakes made during first games: (a) During a turn (action + extra actions via blue tiles) only one expedition card can be played. (b) If the founding of a colony is unsuccessful, then you get one colonist - not an extra action card. (c) If you develop all 5 columns to the second row, then you get an action card (that's why it is mentioned next to the colonist column). Same for the next rows. (d) The expedition cards with an A enhance an action and have to be played before - NOT during - the action (e.g. the extra expedition card, 3 instead of 2, when founding a colony). (e) The viceroy blue tile gives a free upgrade for the least progressed track. (f) The blue tiles (e.g. espionage) should be played in addition to a normal action (either before or after).

A lucky cheap auction grab, that I tried to try but ultimately couldn't be arsed, just didn't click with me at all. The auction system is really neat, but is better implemented in Neue Heimat, which offers a lot more bang for the time spent with considerably less luck. The solitaire micromanagement on the player boards is just booooring and a too big part of the game. The same 'advance techs to get stronger actions' -bit works better in Hansa Teutonica (coupled with the interactive route building part that I like). Also too much luck of the draw for a soulless solo-opimization Euro.

RATING: 7
I really enjoy this game, which merges bidding and development components, much like Princes of Florence.  Play flows pretty smoothly from player to player, so downtime isn't really a problem.  There may be some balancing and chance issues among the development paths (dependent on the number of players).  For a Eurogame, it can also have a hefty time requirement for a full complement of four players.  Player scalability seems pretty good though.  Unfortunately, I get really annoyed at some of the random factors, particularly colonization draws that can range from 2 to 6.

Goa is a game which I'm ready to play every now and then.

Goa is a great game.  Like Jambo it has a really great feel to the game.  The plantations are just really fun and different and really make the atmosphere of the game.

If, on first hearing, the rules sound a overly complex and too fiddly, don't let it stop you and give Goa a chance: you won't have to regret it. This is a beautifully crafted game and it flows surprisingly well. Many different tactics can be used to win, some involving more luck than others - which can be a bit frustrating when your carefully elaborated plan is ruined by some luckard with his expedition cards. Goa is not a beginner's game, its theme is dry and artificial but if you enjoy a well crafted and well oiled gameplay, then you should definitely try it out. But before you do, one word of advice: make sure you understand scoring well!

UPDATE: Has anyone played with the 5 player expansion?

Embarassingly enough, we only just played our first game at GenCon. This is a great game and even though the player with all the experience won, the game was tight with scores of 36-32-30-27. 

The auction mech is greatly enhanced by the selection of tiles off the Flag location - and you have essentially the ability - money allowing - to take the one you chose. Then choosing which of your "techs" to advance also provides a wealth of choices in pursuing a strategy.

We liked enough order while still at the Con and look forward to becoming something of a regular game around here.

Will likely try with fewer players but absent rules that alter the auction process, it would appear that a 2 player game would lose a lot.

Goa is basically two great games in one package. First you have your auction game with its own unique set of rules. Then you have the resource management/VP portion.

I am very happy I got to playtest this before buying - because I didn't like it. Basically felt like a convoluted, less-streamlined Puerto Rico clone, and a poster child for pasted-on themes. Even worse, I played more than half the game with no clue of what I was doing, and the rest with just a rudimentary understanding, and still ended up doing quite well without feeling that I deserved it at all. I'll play it if that's what everybody wants, but otherwise, I'll pass.

VERY, very good game!  I've played both 4-player and 2-player and enjoyed both (I actually prefer playing with 2-players).  The unique auction set up makes each game different.  The card draws to recruit colonists feel somewhat like gambling, which is fun.  In all, this is a great game.  And, like I said, works very well with two.

Another highly tentative rating (see High Society) after 2 plays.  I have to admit I'm having a hard time getting my head wrapped around everything that's going on in this game, so I can't give it a real firm assessment yet, but I definitely want to play again.

UPDATE: After 3 more plays, I am raising this rating to a 9, The game offers great depth, and is a strong intellectual challenge of trying to balance numerous factors.  I'm not sure if it will stay at 9 forever - the replayability probably isn't infinite - but I definitely enjoy playing it a lot right now, and expect to for the foreseeable future.

UPDATE: Goa's replayability is much better than I had feared. Of course, some of that may have to do with how bad I am at the game, but, nevertheless, I am now 16 plays along and still eager to play several times more. The visible gears, and the clunkiness and asymmetry of the colonization track keep it from being a 10, but I doubt that I will ever really regret playing.

One play. Heavy euro with a lot to think about. Not too thematic but not too abstract either. I like the fact that you have lots of different "currencies" to manage (ducat, spices, boat and colonists). I think the exploration track is really important. In fact you cannot neglect any VP sources. So even if there are a lot of ways to make points, it is still important to have a balanced approach.

Goa is a unique game, seemingly highly abstracted and a mess of mechanics thrown together, but in fact is a neatly balanced combination of market fluctuation and skill trees.  Some of the aspects might seem randomly included (or randomly applied; read: Expedition Cards), but correctly assessing what is of a good value not just to you but to every other player as well puts this game in the ranks of Power Grid as far as highly-interactive Euros with no preset strategy.

My initial plays were with my wife, 2 player. I enjoyed the "cat and mouse"  game in the auction and liked the openness of the tech tree. I rated it an 8.5.

Then I finally got to play a 4 player game with my euro gamer friends and one of the players "broke" the game. He was able to acquire everything in the game. From set collections, to colonies to maxing out the tech tree. He maximized his money earlier, then expedition card tech and continuously focused on those cards. By the second last round, there was really nothing else for him to do except cycle the expedition cards to try and score more sets. The other players at the table should have been more competitive and recognized the power of this strategy earlier but at the same time, the fact that someone can "maximize" their score during a game doesn't sit that well with me.

But worse, is that in the future, whenever I think about playing this game, I'm going to be aware of this strong strategy. As a game that comes out once or twice a year, most players won't be familiar with that strategy or maybe even remember it and especially with my wife, my main player for this game, it basically isn't going to work anymore as I'm not going to power game.

Decent euro-game.  Not the most fun I've had with an auction game.  Can get very lucky (or have your [i]ship sunk[/i]) according to your draw of expedition cards.  Another pasted-on-theme euro.  Despite having an auction mechanic, I felt that there was very little player interaction.  My rating might improve with further plays, but I don't see when that is going to happen.

You must own the second edition of this game.  If fixes the dominance of the card track.  There are other options in this game where you can score well using other strategies.  It is one of the better Euros out there with an investing auction mechanic at the beginning of a turn where you select the tiles that will be actioned relative tot he last one selected.  

The theme is the game is not very deep but I really like this Euro.

8/2004 Didn't quite catch me. It tries to be one of those "lot's to do with too few resources" type of games, but it's too easy to get locked out with nothing to do and no resources.  Also, it suffers the "mighty get mightier" syndrome.  Nice components - poor layout.

Excellent game with a lot of subtleties. It's got a simple but challenging auction, and multiple paths to victory. Just enough luck to give everyone a chance, but planning and good strategic are hard to beat. Friends who like medium-heavy games have universally enjoyed Goa. Two-player plays very different from four (both are very good).

RATING: 7
Played a single game. Bun tried hard to get this game and eventually bought one in Japan.
The game is ok at most. Outdated, I should say. The basic mechanism works but the almost single player second part and unlimited auction are going to scare away many new players. They simply won't give this game a second chance. Personally, once I notice I'm trailing there's no catch-up mechanisms (or I might miss), so I just spend 1.5 hours playing a game that I'm certain would lose.
This game is thus best (and only) be played with players with similar level.

A very fun economic based game and a great alternative to Puerto Rico. Unfortunately the game does not lend itself well to two or three players and has a max number of four players.

There is a good game here but it's overshadowed by the Expedition Cards strategy.  What is the motivation to do anything else when I could just focus on drawing cards and be rewarded with free money, colonists, ships, etc.?

Update:  acquired 2nd Ed., is it "fixed?"

A real gamers game where you need experience to win from other experienced players. Its not a very forgiving game. That is what bothers me a bit. On top of that, visually, there is not a lot going on on the table. It's pretty abstract.

A not bad game.  It's not the greatest thing I've ever played, but certainly not the worst.  It has nice components, but the possibility for 'king-making' and one player having a horrible experience are two things that really detract from the fun-factor of this game.  Too bad, really.

This game is at the top of my list. It's an excellent 2 player game and also scales well to 4 players. My wife likes it which is a plus for me. I also like how close the game scores are at the end, making losing players not think that you creamed them to much. :-) I found this easier to teach than Puerto Rico. You do use the whole 1.5 hrs or more to play, which does not bother me. I highly recommend this game.

Not a bad game, but a little too something for me...  I don't like the randomness of the exploration cards.  I like this game less every time I play it.  The third time, I won because I got luck enough to get a set of 5 cards by drawing with my last three actions.

Based on 3 plays.

I am not sure I understand what people like in this one. Its rather dry, very abstract and seems to have more luck than it should in the cards.

2-4p, 90+m.  Highly rated--some people prefer this to Puerto Rico, the latter handling 3-5 players.  I also prefer it to PR, though both tend to be a bit longer than I prefer.  Goa's limited actions per turn becomes agonizing towards the end as you realize you may be only 1 or 2 actions away from overtaking an opponent.  I must say that the end-game bonus for the matching island names on the cards-in-hand is a rather arbitrarily lucky stroke.  It allows someone who appears weak on their mat position to actually win, which can seem anti-climactic and random.

Update: Played again after a long hiatus, and again I got the feeling that auctions sometimes are just a detour from the main action. I enjoy the actions, with development and stuff a la Endeavor, but auctions can be really tiresome. I won´t mind playing this once a year, but that will be enough.
- - -

More friendly than I expected. It seems that almost anything you get can be useful, so just make sure you win _something_ in each auction. Rules were surprisingly incomplete for such a major product, but so far all answers could be found here on BGG. Most of my playings so far have been 2-player. It works, but 3-player is better. Haven´t tried 4 yet.

Can be complicated to teach (people often don't see the point until the end of the first game) but then becomes an exciting race to the finish. Some element of luck can swing the result, but there's a nice emphasis on personal goals with player interaction in the form of the auctions.

I love that there appear to be multiple paths to victory.  Player interaction did seem to decrease as the game got closer to the end, but at least you weren't constantly watching everyone else to decide which action to take (ala Puerto Rico).  

Like some other games in my collection, this one does not get played very often.  It's a little too long.  And now that we have Diamonds Club, it's even less likely to hit the table.

I bought the game 06/30/04. I used the expedition card hand limit rules as written in my Rio Grande rulebook for two years, since the arguement was never resolved as to why they differed from the German rules and what the designer said. At the time Jay Tummelson of RGG swore he changed nothing. And strangely/interestingly his "version" matched the Hans im Gluck FAQ. Very weird. 

Two years went by. Now (July 2006) RGG has issued a second edition. And I see the expedition card hand limit rules now coincide with the German rules. Yet Jay Tummelson never did admit they were wrong in the first place. They were just quietly changed. Whatever. Either way its still a great game.

As of 09/06/17 I've played using my set nine times.

Very good with 2.

One play. Had a nice time playing but felt the random elements had too much influence compared to how much fun they brought to the game. Would be cool if some elements could be turned into a proper boardgame with physical exploration and such, but now I'm dreaming. Will play again.

Edit: now had a second play a couple of years later. The random bits didn't bother me this time. I enjoyed the game more, even though the scores were extremely close (would have been 23, 23, 23 if not for a late game misunderstanding which brought one score down). Wondering if the game might be a bit *too* balanced. But I'm not really worry about that yet, since I had fun.

Played again. Brought rating back down. Just can't make up my mind on this one.

After first 2 plays: Good game, various tactics possible. Reminds me in a positive way of Puerto Rico (choices, choices....)

After some more plays: definitely a great game if you can stand many options and a constant shortage of money... I like it a lot.

After some years: my taste has changed to a point where I think this is a rather unthematic euro, and I'd rather play something else.

I don't understand how this game is rated so highly on the Geek.  The expedition cards are way too powerful, and the winner typically seems be the person who draws the most.  I agree that it has the potential to be an amazing game; it has very well-designed mechanics and intriguing gameplay (even if the theme is a bit light).  But it just isn't fun in its current form.  My gaming group loved this game at first, but now we absolutely hate it due to the overwhelming power of the cards.

Game in a Nutshell: Gain victory points through a mixture of different game mechanics... you know, it's a Euro.

Played as: 3,4 player

Pros: Even after one three-player game, I can see why this would scale well for eather two or four players as well. A lot going on and many different ways to play but is amazingly forgiving in that you can't hurt yourself too bad with a bad choice. 

Cons: Player interaction seems minimal, only rarely did I need to look at what the other players were doing. Even though the listed game length would hint at this being a possible, 'non-gamer' game, the actual gameplay left me far less optimistic.

Other: My one play was a little frustrating. It turned into a learn as we go play with a lot of fixes of rules during the course of the game with going back to fix decisions we'd already made... definitely not the best first impression. That said, I did see promise as the play reminded me a lot of Caylus... not a bad thing. Will be giving it another try.

(edit) Holy crap! Just read the rules... I counted no less then 15 rules eather broken, not observed, or needed some serious clarification in our first play. It's a wonder it was still as enjoyable as it was...

Best Use: Need another play...

I am aware that I am against the overwhelming majority here.
But this game is not only WAY too abstract for my taste, it also lacks (almost) any means of interaction, with the exception of that awfully awkward auction.
Furthermore I fail to see how the game-mechanics are related to what the game is supposed to simulate.
This is a game about game mechanics, not about building a colonial enterprise.
Thus, if you like abstract games with low interaction and pointracing, this will be your game. Otherwise, if you prefer sophisticated simulations with a high amount of flavour and interaction:
Beware!

Played this game a lot recently and once again we learned that this game is severly flawed and unballanced.

In order for this game to work all collums must be equally strong to advance, hence a lot of different strategies.
This is not the case in the game as printet.
Furthermore some cards are clearly broken, all of which makes gameplay messy and an unsatisfying experience.

Edit: New version comming in 2010, with some of the flawes from the original corrected.
Cant wait, as the idea and gameplay for this game really could work.

Solid auction game where you're building up production (similar to PR plantations) and improving actions (similar to Industrial Waste).  Be flexible because you're not going win every auction and if you do win you'll have to pay that money to your fellow opponents.  You have to be savvy with your money and be able to plan ahead of time.  Except for the auctions there's little interaction (similar to Princes of Florence) but there are a ton of decisions to make.

I think the problem is that I just don't get it. I mean, I get how to convert one thing to another in the economy, but I just don't have any idea how to do it more or less efficiently. In the auction, I don't know how to value things.

Maybe I should give this another try, now that I have more gaming experience in general. It might be like my experience with Princes of Florence, which I got a lot better at in only my second play, having played a lot of other games between.

Great game, fun mechanics (I think), and with a reasonable (though not great) theme added on.  Hard decisions, and usually a very close game to the end.

Highly recommended if you like Princes of Florence (likeness to Puerto Rico mentioned by some seems more in theme than in mechanics).

This is a great bid'n'balance game.
You will always be short on something you need in order to do something else.
The scoresheet is a bit diverse and should be handed out to newbees before they start playing so they know what they are striving for (I don't think it is reasonable for anyone to remember them from just one telling).
It is a very enjoyable game but I think needs to be taught to someone by a journeyman not learned from an instruction manual. 

The only negative is that the cost of failure when you try to open a new spice colony seems a bit brutal.

[b]Original Comment (Better for New Players)[/b]

Goa is about on par with Agricola as a "resource management game that I actually like." Both do a good job of mixing a light spatial element with the more prominent process of converting various colorful wooden bits, cards, money, etc. into other colorful wooden bits, cards, money, and ultimately victory points. Both have a completely solitaire "tableau" area that players develop over the course of the game and a central area where the inter-player contests occur, driven by worker placement in Agricola and auctions in Goa. Agricola has the advantages of a more integrated theme and replayability from the cards, but Goa's actually the game that has a bit more of my interest for now.

I had the fortune of finally playing this with three recently, and I must say I decidedly prefer Goa--and perhaps all such games--with just two players. My three-player game took two hours, some bits of which were slightly more interesting than what you'd get with just two, but not really worth the extra hour. At that length, I also become more aware that I'm playing a "spreadsheet" game, as my patience begins to wear a bit thin. With two, Goa takes us only an hour but provides enough to think about that I'm engaged the entire time.
____________

[b]Updated Comment (after over a dozen plays)[/b]

Pretend for a moment that money was removed from Goa. Players would just pick tiles they wanted (instead of picking tiles to be auctioned), as long as those tiles were adjacent to the previous pick. Essentially that would be a worker placement game in which you're competing for "actions" (tiles) to help you develop your individual tableau. Sound familiar? As with all these other games, enough plays will probably find a somewhat optimal path. In this case, it seems to be getting to the second row in all five columns (literally or virtually via an orange tile) and then pounding down the Expedition track.

But Goa [i]does[/i] have money, used in auctions for tiles and brought into the game via player actions. This layer is to me what makes Goa different from any other game I've played and is therefore its most interesting aspect. Moreso than the randomized tiles, the money management aspect of the game is really where the variability comes in. New players will undervalue everything. Old players will have preferences you need to accommodate in your bidding. You constantly have to be considering how much money is in the game, how much everyone else has, and so on. While this additional layer got Goa past my "JASE" filter, now that I've seen it for what it is, I'm not sure how excited I am about it. Take the money management away, and you've got Agricola (Family Rules). Take the tableau development away, and you've got Modern Art. I don't think I really need a mashup of the two.

Wow.  Really interesting.  Love the auction mechanism.  There is a lot going on, maybe more then my gaming friends would care for.  But maybe I need new friends.  Want to play again, maybe own.

Liked my 2nd game even more.  It may have helped that I won.  And I've played a lot more games since my first time so it didn't feel as heavy this time around.  Great game.

It well deserves the title of Classic and that's why it still gets table time after all these years.

A great auction game, I like it when the auction is changed from the basic "I bid X", "Then I bid X+1" "oh yeah? I bid X+2"... Those kind of auctions are boring and drag the game... In this one you only get 1 chance to bid, so you have to weight carefully the need you have for the item and if you want the others more... Like this a lot.

Saw a copy a few days after playing it with the YVRBGG group, and bought a copy because of its relatively hard-to-find reputation. A Fun game of production and resource management, with many paths to victory, each of which really has to be mixed with at least one other to produce a viable winning strategy, producing dozens of combinations. Also relatively forgiving of switching strategy midgame. The oft-maligned colonist cards certainly add a level of adrenaline that most Euros lack, despite the disappointment when they work against you.

Auction mixed with action selection.  I like the way the auction goes since the auctioneer can buy the item for slightly less than the highest bid.  This has an interesting impact on the auctions and ensures that most players will bid at or near the "right" price.

Excellent game.  The auction rounds followed by the action rounds are reminiscent of Princes of Florence.  Both games have that multiplayer solitaire feel to them which I quite enjoy from time to time.  Sometimes it is fun to see if you can build your production engine quicker than the next guy without having to worry too much about interference from the other players.  My goal is to see if this game can hit the table more often.

Rather stale.  For a medium to heavy game, you should expect better game play, but this one leaves me flat.  I will play again, but there are much better games there with similar mechanics (i.e., Puerto Rico, Princes of Florence, to name a few).

This game is a little difficult to grasp the first few plays.  In fact, it took three plays before I had all the rules correct.  However, this is one of my favorite games for 4 players.  Goa is deep and strategic, but still fun.  Nearly every time I play I wish I had just one or two more actions, to help improve my score.

RATING: 6
Probably not ever going to be in my top-tier, but a very good game.

I see elements of Traders Of Genoa in it, particularly in the different combinations of spices needed to pay for the developments [this is reminiscent of the different combinations needed for each of the Large Orders, in particular] and in the placement of the auction markers on the grid [reminiscent of the tower movement]. 

Along the economic engine scale, more like Agricola than Puerto Rico.

This game is right in my wife's & my wheelhouse -- Euro, mid-level complexity, little conflict, some optimization to be done. And the game did not disappoint -- we both enjoyed it! I'm a little curious about long-term replayability, as it felt like throughout the game, both of us were generally following the same pattern of which track to upgrade and when. But I'm certainly not going to worry about it until after a few more plays.

One nice thing about the game is that the turns are very straightforward. You don't really have to worry a lot about following a specific procedure, upkeep of certain things, etc. It's simply: 1) place your auction markers; 2) auction; 3) take 3 actions; 4) repeat. As a result, the game moved at a pretty quick pace! I appreciate games like this because I find that in other games where there's some between-round upkeep (like Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization or Agricola), I have to break my concentration more than I'd like just for game maintenance. I like a game where maintenance is minimal.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The auctions are the most interesting part of the game. However, I can't help but feel that the rest of the game is not much more than an optimisation exercise on a spreadsheet.  Its a good example of how dry and dull Eurogames tend to be. Overall its an OK game but I'll usually only play it due to overwhelming consensus.

This is such a fun game.  The only thing that keeps me from playing more is that my group plays after the kids are in bed so we are too tired for thinking games.

In this elegant looking game you must bid for tiles to improve your enterprise.  There are a number of ways to gain victory points by improving various aspects of your production.

I like the myriad routes to victory you can take.  It does require a long term plan as you never get enough turns to do everything you want to do.  And you never have quite enough money to buy all the things that you need

When you're looking for something a bit more meaty for 2, while still playing easily under 1 hour, look no further.  Goa has beautiful components and is a challenging game.  It plays quite differently with 2 than with 4.  I'll be wanting to play this a lot, because we've undoubtedly only scratched the tip of the possible strategies iceberg...  I must warn you that it's, while good, not a really engaging game, never did I have the need to give a whoot of joy over anything I achieved, so it's a strategical race to get VPs, not a blast and a hoot...  Caveat emptor

Already a classic. As a 2 player game, between experienced players this easily can get near '10' rating, as this has almost everything: depth, choices, replayability, balance... played with more is less rewarding expecially because there are some balance problems that make a strategy clearly better than others.

I really enjoy Goa, but I was okay getting rid of it after awhile. The length of the game is problematic for what the game offers, and the game is particularly dry, much like Dorn's other offerings. Still, the auctioning in this game is very unique, and the tech tree is perhaps my favorite of any game. I just prefer Medici or Ra when it comes to auction games, and even Princes of Florence for a longer, more involved auction game. I would love to see this style of auction re-implemented elsewhere though, as I think it could make for very interesting possibilities.

I feel the same way about Goa as I do about Medina, except this is a game I could not teach to kids.  A lot to wrap your head around.  But I gotta say, you get your moneys worth with this one.
It suffers from AP, but I would love to play this again when we would not have to expain the rules again.  That alone took a good 15-20 minutes.

Very tightly designed game....fun to play, the more I play it the more I like it....very interesting bidding mechanism and learning that extra actions are not as critical to winning the game as first thought as expedition cards can also serve as extra actions and with the bonus they seem one of the keys to winning....nice mix of luck and skill...we play it quite alot...slighty difficult and long but I like that..upgrading again after further play...tough to control myself in bidding but great discipline when I win.  Extremely satisfying.  Moving up my all-time favorites list after further play.

A brilliant game that benefits from random tile layouts to keep the game fresh and a well designed auction mechanism to keep it balanced.  Player interaction is limited to the auction phase similar to Princes of Florence.  I consider this a boon towards limiting kingmaking.  Others may prefer more direct conflict.

I fell a bit behind on the learning curve with this game in my group, which sort of sucks the fun out of things a bit for me. I'm also not as good as I should be at auction games and am terrible at calculating values of things. So, I say to Goa, it's not you, it's me.

Goa is an intriguing game, and another one that is good to play as a two player game at lunch.  I like that there is a lot going on in this game, and the nuances of the auction round is really cool.  The fact that you pay one of your opponents, and not the bank, when winning most auctions is really cool.  The one 3 player game I played was very interesting too.  Most people believe the game plays best with 2 players, but I much prefered the 3 player version.

Goa doesn't really have anything wrong with it, except that there isn't a whole lot of player interaction.  The auctions are a good time to mess with the other players, and the competition for the first to the fourth and fifth row is always good, but other than that there isn't a lot.  I expect this rating might go up with more 3 player games.

Overall comment: multi player solitaire with interactive bidding.  Plays well with any number of players due to the solitaire aspect

Initial rating (wow factor): 7 (game board not very exciting and the player boards are kind of bland)
Family rating: 8 (requested sometimes)
Game group rating: 9 (played frequently - like the quick play and the value decisions that need to be made)
AP rating: 9
Solo play rating: 10 (#2 SoloPlay game - very challenging. Almost prefer to group play)
Purchased: 2006
Expansions recommended: None available
Age Range: 8+

Reason Purchased: Geek analysis

Pros: plays quick, cost decisions, close game scores even with varying skill levels, solo-play
Cons: replayability does suffer due to a sameness of each game, playing more than a few times a week can cause burnout (solo exempted).  An expansion to the game would be welcomed.

Recommendation: worthy purchase, game has a nice flow and plays quick.  Decisions are not overly taxing and it is possible to come from behind to win it in the end 
Replayability: moderate
Game value (play/cost ratio): very high

RATING: 7
In 16th century Goa, players first bid on a number of tiles on a 5 X 5 gird. The number of tiles auctioned is equal to the number of players and the first player gets to place a flag which determines which tile is auctioned first, and the flag itself which is bid on is worth an extra action. Players place their player marker to determine which tile should be auctioned off, and bidding is once round, with the money going to the owner of the player marker. 

After the bidding round each player has 3 actions. Each player has 2 player mats - one mat tracks the colonies they have founded, the other has 5 different tracks to progress: 1) more ships, 2) produce more gems, 3) more money, 4) expedition cards, 5) bonus in founding colonies. 

Players earn pts for how far they progress down the tracks, the number of colonies they have founded, sets of cards and other tiles won from the auction. 

It's a very interesting game and it grows on you. However there is one flaw, and that to be successful, you are forced to go down the expedition card track. The cards in the game are typically better than actions you can take on other tracks. There really is only one way to victory, so the game doesn't have a lot of variety in terms of strategy. I like the auctioning mechanism and the different tracks to progress on, so I sort of wish the expedition card track could be balanced out. The game was published in 2004, and there was a release in 2012 to try to fix some of the imbalance, but I'm not sure that was achieved. It's an engaging game, tense and full of angst, so it's too bad there aren't too many alternatives to your strategy.

Another minor quibble I have with the game is that two people can collude to pay  a high price to each other for the flag, thus gaining an extra action over their opponents.

It's a good game to try and explore for a while, as it has a lot of depth.

Love this game, it's the similar everytime, but I could play it again and again.


Virtually no luck here and the only way other player's can screw you is the auction phase.  But really if you keep track of the money floating about and size up the resources held, you can reduce there screwage and pave your own way to a victory or downfall.

Really engaging decision points and end was close 42-42-45 phenomenal and tiny bit of luck that balances out I suspect even in more than one game. I liked how important the positioning was, the auctioning, the tile placement and usage and the use of three actions. Everything is fairly tight but not too much so and overall just a great experience. Cool tech track too.

Issue is it can be a bit too dry without the tension or dynamism of some other classic euro. Very thinky and strategic but I do wish a bit for more interaction or excitement and not as dry. It can feel kinda lackluster if you don't play with a hardcore euro group imo.

Two other small things I dislike is the Colonization card flip chances, esp if a player essentially wastes an action on that. I generally dislike chance, dice, or card flips in high strategy games. And the other issue is the fourth track is a smidge chance based but also can be a bit overpowering.

After scoring 53 pts I feel less inclined to play nowadays. May trade because I'm not craving to play much if at all. Wish it felt less dry or maybe a bit more thematically fun.

A great game in the style of Princes of Florence or St. Petersburg; that is, a game where a lot of small efficient moves will determine the winner. Progress is steady and measured, with many interesting decisions for the players to make, due to the marvellously designed interlocking subsystems used in the game.  However, it's also a game style that lacks drama -- there are no surprise moments or grand gestures, so if what you want is [i]excitement[/i], you'd better look elsewhere. Thematically, Goa is similar to Puerto Rico, but structurally more like PoF.  If you  like Princes and do well at it, you'll enjoy this one too.  

Unlike Princes, this plays well with fewer players, so it's worth owning both games.  However, Princes is less fiddly, more strategic, and has a more dynamic auction phase, which makes it a bit better game overall.  Still, Goa is an excellent purchase if this style of game appeals to you and you are looking for something for 3-4 players. It certainly appeals to me! :meeple:

Some of my love for this game has worn off, largely because I keep seeing the same players get very lucky or very unlucky, ALL the time, when it comes to colonizing.  Goa, with its tightly limited number of turns, demands efficiency from its players, yet the only sure way to circumvent the colonization luck factor is to acquire lots of colonists, which may turn out to be a total waste of resources.  Still, its merits are numerous enough to keep it in the class of games that I'm always willing to play.

This game is so well balanced.  Every action in every phase is loaded with tension.  I love this.  Nothing is overly too important in the game.  Money is very important, but again not the be-all-end-all of the game.  Interesting bidding mechanics similar to Modern Art in how money is doled out.  There are a few brain burning minutes, but they are relatively low in number.  A lot of strategy, a few simple actions, downtime is pretty low between turns.  Highly recommended.

More comments after a couple of plays.  Seems that the mechanics of this game are wearing thin.  A friend called the game "antiquated", and I believe that term to apply perfectly.  Classic euro game, but maybe a little too euro for my tastes.

RATING: 8
My thoughts on this game have changed more than any other in such a short period of time. At first I thought it was an incredibly deep game, but I had some concerns over the luck aspects - particularly the symbol scoring of the expedition cards. A few more plays convinced me that this wasn't nearly the problem I thought it was since the cards were too valuable to collect. Now, after about 10 games, my opinion is heading downward. The reason is because of those darned expedition cards. In my mind, the only viable strategy is to invest heavily in gaining the ability to draw and hold more expedition cards. All other courses of action are just too time consuming based on the limited number of actions you get. We went from the winner scoring in the low 40s to now when the winning scores are near 60. The only way to compete is through the cards. That said, the luck factor shines through in full force, both in who gets the "good" cards (all cards are good, but not all cards are equally good to all people - if the right cards come up for you, you'll do well... otherwise you'll struggle... though you will STILL beat those that try an approach OTHER than using the cards) and who gets the matching symbols at the end. I still enjoy playing the game, and that's the most important factor... maybe I'll find other ways to win during future plays!

I gave it a second chance.  A 5 was a bit harsh, but a 6 is probably spot on for me with this game.  It works as a game, no doubt.  There are some interesting things to manage.  I don't care for how exacerbated the runaway leader phenomenon can get, though I imagine that's less of an issue amongst experienced players.  I don't care for such a head-heavy game having a luck component that can burn you so heavily in the form of founding colonies and I don't expect that will ever change.

But most of all I just don't feel the fun.  Challenge, yes.  Fun, not so much.  For the amount of mental work the game demands there should be proportional payoff in enjoyment and I'm just not getting it from this one.  I'll be surprised if the rating changes from here.
-----

Update - Bumped up to 7.  The scores still seem artificially constrained and the luck of drawing colonists still bugs me, but the game has slowed down after a few plays.  The auction is more fun than I gave it credit for initially (back when I was jaded with auction mechanics in general).  Time will tell if it goes up another point, but I feel it will settle at either 7 or 8.

-------
Finally at 8.  Likely it's final resting place.  Steep learning curve on how to finesse the auction.  A bit of a sledgehammery scoring system, but the game engine overcomes that enough to push Goa into the upper tier.

Played one 2 player game and this game is great!! Bidding will be even more interesting with 4 players.Love how little time you have for everything thus making players strongly fight for additional moves. The game is basically based on getting as many moves as possible and developing your player board in all criteria. 

Edit: After a 4 player game it seems that fighting for the flag is vital. It guaratees you not only an additional action but also gives you a chance to make money before the bidding starts for other tokens. I won the game as only one person fought for the flag. Would like to see what happens when all 4 players make use of the flag bidding and do not give it away too easily.

Really enjoyed this one, particularly the mechanic whereby players select the items to auction.  I might have to buy this so that I can play it more often.  Looking forward to the reprint.  The only downside of this one is that the action phase is too player independent, and each action takes a little too long.  My house rules will include an everyone moves at once fix.

A core bidding game.  Everything in the game is decided by bidding and it all works very cleverly and well together.  The problem I always find with bidding games however is the length of a game is usually determined by the slowest bidder, and it will take a few plays for people to understand the impact of each different tile to bid for.

I really loved how everything meshed together in this game where you want to build up different parts of your player board to allow you to acquire more cards and/or actions.  I would definitely play this game again, but with the bidding and my group, I don't see this being a game needed in my collection.

Classic auction euro that, 11 years later, feels like it's missing some dynamism. It may have been a point salad back in the day, but there are few ways to make points when compared to contemporary euros of this weight. Perhaps it's a more disciplined game for it, but for me it felt stilted.

When I saw the tech tree and heard the victory points were mostly based on it, my heart sank.  It looked like we were getting into yet another Excel spreadsheet game with a tacked on Euro theme.  And in a way, that held fast.

But in another way, a fantastic race game appeared.  Running as fast as we could to the end of the tech tree, the colonies.  Running against the clock as our limited actions ticked away.  Running on caffeine fumes at 10:15 on a Saturday night.  And wow, did I find myself enjoying it.

Completely based on 1 play, and I don't care.  It's good.  I could see it getting annoying after 20 plays, perhaps, but for the occasional itch, it satisfies.

Once you understand this seemingly complex game you will love it. The auctions are tense, and there is plenty to think about for your action choices. There are many ways to win, plays best with 2 and it is also good with 4 players, with 3 players it is a bit less balanced. There's quite a bit of luck involved in the card draw. If played slowly, it takes less than 3 hours with 4, less than 2 with 2.

Game seems balanced and there is lot to do, but not much time to do it. There are 8 auction rounds and 24+ actions for each players. After the second game I was sure that Goa is a very good game. Something with this game just works. Great resource management game that offers (at least an illusion of) many ways for a victory. An excellent game!

With my group our games with four players take some time (2,5-3h usually) but they never feel long. Sign of a good game. I've played with 4 and 3 players and game works equally well with both ways.

An excellent game of using action points to their best effect under changing circumstances.  This will appeal to any eurogame fan that doesn't mind the 90 minute playing time.  A must-own, in my opinion.  The only criticism that I have for it is that it's a little bit like a lot of other games, and doesn't have a whole lot new going on.  On the other hand, if you take the best of existing mechanics, you're likely to get a good game, and the result in this case is Goa.

A well executed efficiency style Euro, but at no point do you feel like you're a company trading in Goa. A bit bland for a game about spices...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Not being particularly innovative (managing six or seven things at once has pretty much become a fixture in German games nowadays), Goa is nevertheless one of the games where the wealth of included mechanisms (positional play, auctioning, resource management, action cards, engine building, a pinch of luck) have been interwoven in the most tasteful fashion. Players auctioning for tiles placed on a board before each turn is a quite ingenious addition to the usual "four actions in a round and four rounds in a phase" routine, and the rather complex network of dependencies between all resources to have them developed as evenly as possible for optimum results has been faultlessly balanced.

The eclectic amount of the elements comprised in Goa means that it takes a bit longer to understand it than other games with a comparable or even higher level of difficulty (as the ever so present Caylus). The other side of it is that Goa is a more varied game, where both the setup and the development of each phase can lead to unexpected turns more easily.

Bella scoperta. Un gioco molto carino, con aste, gestione risorse e scelta della strategia. Coltivare le spezie, spedirle, riseminarle con continue scelte e valutazioni. Un gioco ben pensato con pochi tempi morti, ottima interazione e molto profondo. Il gioco è complesso e forse un po' lunghetto, anche se dal di dentro ogni partita sembra volare: 4 turni nella fase A e 4 nella fase B. Viste le poche fasdi diventa importante scegliere con fermezza una strategia e portarla fino in fondo.

RATING: 9
Lovely action-management, an intriguing auction mechanism, and quite possibly the most mis-read set of rules anywhere. The worst box inset known to man, but a very, very good and surprisingly lightweight game for all that.

The 2-player game has been much lauded, but with more players the focus switches from the auction to the Action Card distribution, and the game is all the richer for it. For the lengths to which it involves and engages its participants, this is deservedly Rudiger Dorn's masterwork.

Further Thoughts: I just can't find the flaws in this game any more, not since I junked the box insert! Upgraded to - and beyond - the elite.

Further, Further Thoughts: Ah...sometimes a quarter-century is enough. Downgraded from 10 to 8.5: this one doesn't quite grab me as often as it used to.

Played a few times:

- some depth, but not overly complicated (still, it is a gamer's game)

- game where you build up your production/resources but typical Euro where you can't suffer setbacks or destruction (i.e. you can't be wiped out, go bankrupt or be conquered or have things stolen from you)

- interaction with other players is limited to the auction phase, and a lot of time people are taking actions which wont likely effect anyone else directly

- although funds are kept secret, being able to track what others have so you know what to bid is an important skill (haven't tried playing with open money, but I'm sure some do that)

RATING: 8
Goa feels like Puerto Rico thematically, but the mechanics and scoring are completely different. Goa is (slightly) more complex and quite long at 2hrs30 (4 player). Each player has their own separate board to track their holdings and there is a central 5x5 board of tiles which determines what can be auctioned.

The game centres around scoring points (mainly) by producing goods and putting them on ships in order to make yourself more efficient at the 5 main actions (producing goods, taxation, founding colonies, acquiring ships, drawing development cards). The cards make the game more random than PR’s plantation draw, but I don’t find it a problem.

There are 8 turns, each turn has 2 parts, the auction part and the main part where players take actions. Each player nominates a tile (or 2 if you are 1st player), the catch is that the tile you nominate must be adjacent to the tile nominated by the player before you. Then they are sold in a once round auction, so as auctioneer you get to hear everyone else’s bid then decide either to take their money or buy the tile yourself (paying your money to the bank). Also the 1st player marker is a purchasable commodity.

With money leaving the game and entering the game (through the taxation action, tiles and cards) the players collective decisions result in inflation or deflation of the game economy. This is significant since money circulates around via the auctions. This is distinct from the progressive devaluation of cash in PR as you get bonus points for most cash at the end, so you always want to have as much as you can get your hands on (but that’s also true of other game elements that need to be weighed up). Oh, money is also kept hidden, though I strongly prefer to house-rule it open.

The other main pressure acting against you besides money is the limited number of actions. You really want to do 5 or 6 things per turn but can only do about 3 or so. So you have to prioritise and decide which are your most important actions. Another agonizing dilemma is that you get more points if you get very specialised, but if you neglect to advance some of the tracks you'll run into problems which leads to some delicious decision points.

As a warning, the game is low on interaction outside of the auction, the theme is thinner than most German games, and it has a fairly hard learning curve because there are so many different tiles. As a new player I found it difficult to evaluate the tiles so I can see this leading to under/over bidding issues in a group of mixed experience. I expect it would still be less of a problem than a mixed PR group where one person is crafting too much. In other words it is less “new player friendly” than many games of similar complexity.

Excellent game, though I will never play it without 'Pauls optional rule' (Colonist cards always worth 2), since this random element can completely screw the game for you on round 1.  Played it a few times now with this optional rule and it is a lot better

Rudiger Dorn does it again. One of the most pleasant experiences I've had gaming. I've played this two times and they've both been placid despite it being a victory-point Euro. Maybe it's building your own tiny colonial merchant empire away from other players or the beige colors of the components, but I felt very at peace (not bored) playing Goa. The auction mechanic works well here as there are several different tiles that have their unique value for any strategy. There are multiple paths to victory (although getting more actions per round seems to be the common denomination) and the set-up of the tiles changes all the time, forcing players to re-evaluate their strategies. While non-interaction with other players may be a downfall for other games in my opinion, I felt constantly engaged with my opponents during their turns. Enjoyable and always a fun game to play with friends who aren't afraid of "colonial"-themed games.

This game is today still the best optimisation game around.

After many years it's still one of my favourite games! It doesn't seem to age! I love the emphasis on efficiency, you just have so many actions to do so make 'em worth your while! I love the idea that you can't develop all the columns but have to combine at least two, discovering these combinations is a beautiful process. Once you discovered these and feel that you got the strategy down, it's time to dedicate your full attention to the auction market and try to make it work the best way for you.

An absolute must have in any gamer's collection. Do not live without it.

- Good rules, well structured and barely give you nay reason to resort to the rules once you went through them.

RATING: 8
Interesting auction phase followed by a solitaire-ish action phase.  The auction is what makes this game shine since players determine what tiles go up for bid and players must decide to sell their own tiles for profit or buy them instead.  The fact that if a player wins a tile through auction he pays THAT PLAYER instead of the bank is really what makes this auction great.  A player only pays the bank if he purchases his own tile.
 During the action phase, you are faced with many choices, most of which are good.  But you have to tailor your actions around the tiles you won in the auction phase.  Yeah, the game is a bit dry and not all the mechanics make thematic sense.  But I'm a euro guy so I obviously don't care.  I would never turn down a game of this.

UPDATE:  After a couple of dozen plays, I feel like I have played this one out.  It's still a euro that deserves classic status and I won't turn down a game of it when the situation arises, but I decided o put it up for trade.

RATING: 9
Goa is one of my favorite games. The fantastic thing about Goa is the staggering number of choices you have, and the many ways they intertwine.  It favors having a strategy early on and nurturing it through the game. This is an uncommon trait in euros!

Is it multi player solitaire?  I think of all the euro-games this charge has been made to, Goa does deserve it to some degree, although not as much as Puerto Rico.  The action phase seems to be hardly interactive in any way, except that you do need to watch what the other players are up to, and try to figure out how much money they have (or play with open money for a very sharp game).  You need to spend your actions carefully to prepare yourself for the next auction.  But, observing other players' actions is not interaction.  

We play by letting players take all three regular actions together. It makes no real difference to the game (contrary to prevailing wisdom around here). After all players have played their regular actions, players may use any action cards to take extra actions.

The auctions, of course, are brutally interactive.  They get more and more cut-throat as the game proceeds.  Play this with two and just see how vicious it can be close to the end. Errors in optimization at any stage of the game will set you back, but errors in later rounds are naturally harder to recover from.

This is a fantastic game.  I really like the spatial aspect of the auction, you have some control over what gets auctioned, but not complete control, and some knowledge of what will be auctioned in the future, but not complete knowledge.  Each turn presents a variety of tough decisions, and you can take your company in a number of different directions.  The game can be a little fragile; if one or more players runs out of money or doesn't value things properly, other players can benefit based on seating.  Additionally, the once-around auction demands that your valuing be right on the first try, because you don't get another chance.

Picked this up at a shop outside of Albany in the summer of 2005. Beautiful components, will surely hit the table soon. 12/20/06 Played solitare, I like this one... too soon to rate, but it will be hitting table soon, probably to supplant a Puerto Rico type itch. 1-5-10 Traded with Attika and Goa for Command & Colors: Ancients, and ?

9/2014: I consider myself to be a German gamer, a Euro Gamer, and a Hybrid Gamer. I've come around with the hobby as it's developed since 2000.

Goa was a grail game until the reprint. I got it when it was a grail game. I tried it several times solitaire, and it seemed ok...

But then I dragged someone into playing it with me, and it fell completely flat. 

It felt like a "modern" German-game (Stefan Feld style), but it was more of a precursor to it I think.

Anyway - it just fell flat with me.

RATING: 5.5
OWN July/06.  Unplayed.  Read the rules; there SHOULD be some sort of summary card with this game!  Auctions, then actions, and something like 8 ways to score points...

More reading, and this sure seems like it'll be an auction + multiplayer solitaire.  I hope not, or I may have made a mistake & have difficulty getting my typical casual gamers to play it.

TRY Aug/06: Well, that's definitely what it is.  However, it seems decent amongst this type.  The auction isn't too bad to figure out approximate values.  Opening rating of 6.5, but needs more plays.  Some player aids to remind of the different ways to score seem like a necessity.

Apr/08: Traded.

Pretty good Euro. Simple rules yet oozing with strategy. Compelling auction mechanics. Components are rather cheap. I like having cards for money rather than coins though. Many tough decisions throughout and final scores are usually fairly close. Play time is short but requires a lot of thinking.

When our gaming friend comes over, this has replaced Puerto Rico as the one that gets pulled out for the long game of the evening.  One of the biggest reasons it keeps hitting the table, I think, is that no one is able to come up with a dominating strategy.  The games are always close, and very rarely does anyone win twice in a row.

RATING: 8
Rules are simple, but you need a lot of attention to get into them, provided the great number of pieces that the game has. The material is really gorgeous. The game is rather standard, not so similar to PR, rather a mix between PR and Siedler IMHO. You have to produce some resource, get it and use it to create greater productions, or money, or victory points, always in tention to decide how to use your new resources. Every moment there's a decision that can change your entire long term strategy. It also works very well with two players. One disappointment: there is no way to count the 3 actions played within a round, and this can create a little problem. Strange, because every single piece has its own place and every thing seems thought with a lot of accurancy. Maybe I just missed something.
=====
After some plays the score remains 8, although it feels more and more abstract, sometimes lonely, and very very very difficult. This is the point: the game is very brain-consuming, but it doesn't look to be very deep: you always have to manage a hundred of things, that's why it's difficult.

Another impressive economics game. Interesting, strategic, multiple ways of achieving your goals and a very intelligent auction mechanism  that really elevates this above the average.It's a true gamer's game that rewards planning, flexibility and creative playing. Luck also plays a role with the expedition cards and the colony foundation mechanism. Some people complained that its role is too important but in my (limited) experience it has never been an issue. Overall a great game and a very solid design. My favorite Rudiger Dorn game to date.UPDATE: I played again 4 player and I definitely prefer it with less players. It's not a bad game with 4, far from it, but there are other games that I prefer for that particular setup (PoF, PR, AoS, ...). Rating went down 9->8. Still an amazing 2p game... I think I would rate it a 9!

The game is tough. There is a lot to do and so few actions. At the same time others are harassing you by bidding higher and higher prices.
The board isn't very beautiful but at least it's very practical.
At first I was quite confused with all the options but I got the idea of the game rather quickly. After that there wasn't many moves I considered wasted afterwards. Occasionally can be very forgiving game!

The auction system in this game is fantastic - you really have to consider the other players' objectives to get what you want out of it.

My kind of game.  Compete for tiles and build an economy.  Way more fun than it sounds.  It's really close to perfect and it's a lot of fun.  However, I'm non-plussed about the weird tile selection puzzle in the middle of the game board - and the rules regarding the purple cards get too mucked up and out of balance.  Less could be more for this one.

I played this game today at my local board game meetup. I've heard so much about this game and I finally get to play it. It was a fun game. The navigation cards are so important to have at the end game, but as a newbie I started to play the game developing every row possible. I would like to play again if I have a chance.

RATING: 8
An excellent game, but not as streamlined as Puerto Rico or El Grande.  Every move seems carefully balanced, and the final scoring for the cards can be a bit nutty (as can founding the colonies, but not to the same extent).  Other than that, the game feels like it forces even scores.  Not very intuitive and difficult to learn.  After a couple plays, I'm beginning to "get" it a bit more. Extra Actions rock!

Good game, which probably would have gotten a higher rating if I hadn't played games like Puerto Rico or Age of Empires III before. Now it felt like just another (good) game in that category.

Edit 19/096/2016: Second play after more then 7 years. Imho this game ain't that great. Drawing cards seems to be the way to go and it's sort of frustrating that it's a 1-bid-only-auction. If it would be an auction were everybody bids until all but one passes, you can really go for the tile you want, while now it's a bit of a crapshoot and if you're second you can almost be sure you want get it.

Phenomenal!!  Better than "Puerto Rico" - Yes, it's THAT good!!  (It's very similar to PR)  All the great elements I love about board games put into one: Unique bidding that fits well for the game, tight scoring, fast flowing, agonizing decisions, tight scoring, upgrading/progression, multiple paths to victory, cleverness, extremely well-balanced, beautiful bits & artwork.  My only beef is that the "colonization" theme is a bit old & rules are a TAD fidgity. Definitely best with 4 players although good with 3.  Probably won't reach PR's high rankings because there is a bit more luck involved, but not too much more.

Goa is just full of mechanisms and light on player interaction.  There's a paper-thin theme in there as well, but the game seems so convoluted with mechanisms and considerations that it's hard to squeeze the 'fun' in there.  Teaching this thing is daunting.  I can truly see why many people like it - it IS a brain-burning game, and some of my friends DO really enjoy playing it, but it's not my favourite kind of game and I'll only really play it if the group asks for it.

A fantastic multi-faceted game with great replayability value and balance. It has some general similarities to The Princes of Florence, with lots of details to pay attention to. Fantastic player interaction and an incredible amount of tough decision making through out.

Goa is generally somewhat heavier and more involved than typical German style games.  The understanding of functions of the tiles and the Expedition cards require some careful attention to details, which may scare away first-timers, but after a couple of plays familiarity with the tiles and cards will enhance the understanding and enjoyment of the game.

Goa is one of those games that starts out very strong and rapidly declines in interest. Here, the reason is that the expedition card strategy is too strong and this lack of balance tarnishes what looks like a game with many paths to victory.

Excellent resource management game (probably one of the best, if not THE best). May suffer from optimum strategy syndrome but needs additional plays to determine.

Goa is a brilliant Euro game. It is one of the best game in it's genre. Goa almost feels like a pseudo-civilization game where players build up technology tracks to improve their civilizations. The auction mechanism is perfect. If I could rate this game an 11 I would.

Of all the classic designer Eurogames I have played this is by far my favorite. 

Disclaimer: The latest edition of Goa seems to have changed some significant rules that I am not in favor of, specifically how the person auctioning can pay for their own auction at a -1 cost. I would rather play the original rule set. I am a Goa purest.

A very enjoyable play of this classic has got me thinking about the word 'dry' when it comes to games, which is a derogation usually aimed at Euros (I'll leave Abstracts out of this). There is almost no theme here, which seems to be the qualification of 'dry', yet the game is undeniably good. Excuse me for an aside...

I can think of three other games I’ve played at my regular group that have been described as 'dry': Medina, Mombasa, and Kingsburg. I found the physical building of the buildings in Medina to be enough 'theme' for me. Mombasa is great, despite its wonky bookkeeping track, and as it's a re-themed 18XX (AFAIK), then the accusation is a fair cop. Kingsburg, though, was both dry and random which is what really made me never want to play it again.

So, Goa, I think, works despite being dry because the good mechanisms are bolstered by minimal randomness which is restricted to the settler draw. Spicy goodness.

I had been looking forward to Goa for quite a while; it's a well-regarded Euro that sounded right up my alley. But I was rather disappointed by my first play. The meat of the game is optimisation, and players spent most of their time with eyes down on their own little 'spreadsheet', working out the best actions. The theme is almost non-existent -- why should ginger and cloves (or whatever) be just what you need to advance your ship-building technology? -- which makes the game feel very dry. The best part is the auction, but even then the once-around bidding reduces the feel of interaction. I can see that there are lots of subtleties that could be revealed over multiple plays (the inflation/deflation effects are interesting), but I'm not sure I have much desire to uncover them.

Good resource management game. The one who is most efficient in their actions will usually win. It is a little bit of a solo game in that the majority of interaction only occurs during the bidding phase, however it does give you the opportunity to attempt to block other players strategy during the auctions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I'm so glad this is finally back in print.  Clearly the development columns are not balanced, but that's what the auction is for!  As with nearly all auction games, success in Goa pivotally depends on your ability to correctly value the available items.  I you believe the expedition card strategy is the strongest (as I do), then go for it!  If your opponents agree on this point, then it is going to be very expensive to get the necessary nutmeg and/or clove plantations.

Like the 2 phase approach - A limited action, resource optimization phase with a combined auction phase. Both mechanisms are well balanced. 
In the auctions you find yourself auctioning items that you know others want to get money to get what YOU want.
In the action phase you are trying to get the most of each action. To specialize gives you more VPs to be more balance gives you more actions which should help in getting a better position

The game plays well with 4, and I could see that it could scale down to lesser numbers and still play well.

I would give that game a higher rating if it was not for the fact that I have played mostly 2 player games and each time, it was the guy that had built less plantation and that had less spices that won the game. The expedition cards seems to be to powerfull and are you best bet for victory. This gives a little bit less importance to the theme of the game. A must have game. I will have to reconsidere my rating if I play the game with more players. Would deserve to be in the top 10 of BGG

Je donnerais une note moins sévère à ce jeux si ce n'était que j'ai joué toutes mes parties à deux joueurs et que chaque partie a été remportée par le joueur ayant le moins de plantations et d'épices, ce qui va l'encontre du thème du jeux. Les cartes expéditions semblent trop puissantes et semble être la meilleure chance de vistoire. Reste un jeux indispensable. Je vais reconsidérer ma note suite à des parties de plus de deux joueurs.

A wonderful, glorious mess of a game. This is a game to give Puerto Rico a run for its money. There are so many things to think about here, and so many ways to earn points that I don't see much overlap in strategies. I think each player has to be very adaptable to what happens in the auction round, and work their hardest at the action rounds.
  This game really feels like the bastard offspring of Princes of Florence and Puerto Rico. I mean that in a good way. It has a feel all its own but pays homage to both those worthies of recent years.

Fantastic with 4P -- Good with 3P -- Poor with 2P.
Third on my list of all time favorites after Spades and Union Pacific.  Nearly every game I've played of this the winner has been determined by one point.  The room for mistakes are minimal and not succeeding in founding a colony can kill you.  So many options and so many paths to victory!  Spend a ducat too much on something and you could lose the game.  And deciding what will be bid on is crucial.  So much to think about and plan for!  Love it!

Interminable. The auction is cool and is without question the best part. It's spatial, you can exert some influence, you can be a jerk.

Interesting game.  I like the "Dorn Tower" mechanism of the bidding and there are a number of paths to victory.  The bidding phase is a very exciting tactical element to the game.  It's fun to try and figure out how badly the other players want specific items.  It's also quite fun building up your tech trees and exploiting the special powers that entails.

RATING: 5
UPDATE: Traded this away. I really don't like auction games (except the blind variety). And I only enjoy it as a two-player game.

I love the action element of this game. It forces you to try to deduce what your opponents want. Although the mechanism to choose the elements to auction off is incredibly abstract, it adds some subtle interaction.

Unfortunately, the other part of the game -- the "develop your business" part is *dry*, time-consuming, and fiddly. You don't actually build anything; all you do is move gray cubes in one direction, one step at a time. Also, these steps, which improve your business, are too incremental; they don't jump in dramatic spurts like Puerto Rico, which adds to the dryness, and the "lack of dramatic arc" some have complained about. Indeed, this part of the game feels like a uneven conglomeration of every mechanic in which resources can be gathered and/or spent, complicating this game way too much, and adding way too much game play time (in the form of bookkeeping and squinting at your own and your opponent's player boards). To be fair, this conglomeration is tightly integrated with each resource dependent on another in a significantly different manner.

However, it is because of this conglomeration that makes the auction part great; the actions being auctioned off are so disparate and varied (and useful, unlike the special actions in Age of Steam) compared to other bidding games, which ultimately makes this element of the game constantly tense.

Basically, best heavy auction game, which loses (a lot) of points from undue (but perhaps necessary) complexity.

Nice game. There are several strategies that can take you through the game. Can't wait to play a few more times to get a better feel for each strategy (cards are good).

I do not like this as a 3 player game. Would rather play with 4. However, once I get better at strategies, I may change my mind.

RATING: 8.7
Very good set of rules give the player an exponentially expanding number of paths to victory - or defeat - to explore, so each game will be different from any previous game.  Combines resource management with auctions. I do wish there was more direct player interaction, though, and I didn't like the mechanism of ending the game (too abrupt), so I can't quite rate it a 9. Even so, the more I play it, the more I like it.

Seems similar to Puerto Rico in my estimation, though Goa does not seem to follow such a patterned sequence of play. Unlike Puerto Rico, however, Goa seems even more abstract and fails to evoke its theme as well.

RATING: 6
Goa has a lot of fascinating economic elements that require a bit of play to really begin to master.  Having to pay other PLAYERS for things you need to win makes you think on a whole other level.  It also leads people to take FOREVER to make a decision... that's why I ended up selling it.

Do NOT expect to bring this out at a gathering to play and be done in time for dinner.  This is a game that deserves time allotted to it, not the other way around.  Rushing your players will only make the game harder to play (honestly! If people start getting distracted it's AWFUL to try and finish).

I enjoy this game.  It can get fairly tense towards the end as you try to accomplish too many things with too few actions left. 

I enjoy the mechanics of placing the flag and the auctions.

One problem is that there is a clear strategy that cards + spice harvesting is the strongest strategy.  (Well I guess cards + anything, but harvesting gets you the special harvest, selling spices, and ship w/o boats as excellent bonuses).

My brother claims cash and flag are king in 2 players

update 2012

I've tried this again with the new rules for money from the new edition that is due out (5 for start player, buy own auction for 1 less, 3 ducats per turn for the red tile, and advance track with money is not an action).

I enjoyed this rule set much more.  Money was more relevant and dynamic.

A very heavy game from Rüdiger Dorn. The theme couldn't be thinner, it's more like an abstract, but mechanicalwise it's very good! The 3 different phase of the game, the deploying of the auction markers, the auction itself and the action-phase all have their own twists and flavour, and you never seem have enough money and action to do all that you want. But don't play it if you are tired!

LOVE this one. I've always felt that I don't like bidding games, but the bidding in this one is different.. strategic, yet civil. Cute spice bags and seemingly many ways to get ahead.

Outstanding bidding game, where each round the tiles to be auctioned are selected by players in a unique method where each selected tile must be adjacent to its predecessor. Actions are then taken to: improve one's strength in 5 resource tracks  (money, ships, goods, colonists, or expedition cards collected); to collect those resources; or to found colonies. There are many paths to victory, yet the game is so balanced that completely different approaches can result in a win by just one point. Very fun and interactive. Played with 2 and 3 (which was much better), yet to try with 4.

My only play of this we played the auction rules incorrectly, and initially the game felt a little bit dry. However, on about the fourth round everybody's attempts do things collapsed. We realised that the economy was rather more complicated than we had thought, which is what makes it interesting. 
The game is played over eight rounds: in each round players bid for various tiles and then take three actions to develop their colony. These actions allow them to get better resources in future rounds and score victory points at the end of games. Fairly standard but the way they are put together makes the game challenging without creating a dominant strategy. 
Definitely one I'd like to try again.

My favorite game. It scales well from 2-4 (3 being slightly best), and it has a ton of choices which lead to multiple paths for victory. It has just the right amount of player interaction for those less aggressive types but just enough to keep it exciting. For us there is also a "fun" factor present that might be lacking in other "deep" games. If time permits, this is the game for my wife and me.

One of the most enjoyable auction game out there, though the tech tree building is arguably as if not more important than the auction aspect. I'm not fond of the symbol matching of the exploration cards granting VP, even in the second iteration of the game - it's an unwelcome, luck-driven, potentially game-deciding late game move if you have no other way to score points in B-IV.

25-09-2015. Rated after 1 play with 3.
Goa is a fairly typical auction euro game.

You have a playerboard and a board where you can stock resources and 'discovered?' cities.  Each turn consists of auctioning several tiles (1 more than the number of players, I think) from a main board. You can get fields (resources), settlers and ships. You can use resources and ships to upgrade your playerboard. This is filled with special abilities you can improve.. like getting more money.

Game is quite ok. It's a fairly light euro-game, but it's really hard to see 'proper' paths. I finished my game last and gave away the win because I didn't know how to auction in round 1. It's difficult to.. 'judge' the value of a tile starting out, especially when you play gamers who played the game 100+ times.
That said, it was quite ok.

Based on one play.

Dry but engrossing. Really makes you think.  It's certainly a gamer's game, but the vast amount of paths you can take to victory are enticing and add mightily to the replayability.  I really want to play this one some more. 

Theme is so pasted on that it's actually kind of funny.

Rating is a tentative 7 right now, which could go up or down with more plays... but with only one play (which was over 1 year ago), it's hard for me to make a concrete conclusion on this one.

Goa is one of the elite games I have ever played. It's auction is great, the limited action and planning aspect is my cup of tea, and the tight economics are fun. Since the reprint this is my most played game. I had played it a couple of times before the reprint and really liked it, now that I grasp it better it's even more fun to play. Playing it a lot with the same group has gotten the time down to a reasonable hour and a half with 4 people. It's climbing in my rankings.

I am sure I will be playing this game for years to come and still finding new strategies. If you like the meatier german games, you will love Goa.

Great econommic game. It has something from Caylus, something from Puerto Rico and some very nice, innovative own features. And it's hard. Not a game to play with your girlfriend ;)

I will never turn down a game of Goa. Mind you, I'm rarely offered a game of Goa. I haven't found any flaws in this one yet. The auctioning works beautifully and the advancement tracks seem well balanced. So, anyone going to offer to play this with me?

I spent my entire one play in a total fog, and I still tied for the win. It's one of those horrible Euro-games, where every mechanic on earth is thrown into the mix simply for its own sake. It bakes your brain with no return on your toil. Avoid this one.

Played this once. It seemed like Puerto Rico with auctions. Fun! I should buy this. (addition: I have got this for my birthday!)
(13 Sept 2017): I have played this more often since last comment. It's really nice, but I don't see it hitting the table easily anymore. The last time I played it was with 5 people, and it became a bit long a repetitive. So I sold it.

I honestly do not understand why Rudiger Dorn isn't better renowned.  His games tend to be excellent and unique; if I have a complaint about this game, it's that the auction mechanism could scale better (the grid seems much larger than necessary for two players).

After a few plays I thought the shine had worn off. Not so. The expedition card strategy isn't necessarily the be all and end all I thought it was. Players have scored 56 points to 46 points in a four player game while mixing up their strategies. Auction choice and valuation make a huge impact, and I'd say getting this right is one of the major keys to the game. I await further plays and attempting yet another different strategy.

Rudiger Dorn is really climbing the list of my favorite designers lately.  This game is all about planning and economics.  You will always want to do more than you can, which makes for some of the toughest decisions in gaming.  Your choices impact your opponents, and theirs impact you, even if there is little direct interaction in the game.

After 10+ games I can say this game is really that good. A meaty game with just a hint of luck. I like the multiple paths to victory. The game flow very much depends on your opponents play, making each game different. A great 'Gamers Game'

RATING: 8
Four plus years between plays - but that isn't because I didn't enjoy it.  Au contraire, this is really a fun game.  Easy to jump back into with just a quick glance over on the rules - and just about as easy for a new player.

Interesting to see how various strategies are/aren't successful.  And surprisingly the 'no money' route (never go up on the money track, and by focusing on a picking up a couple of "get one every round" tiles right off the bat instead) was ultimately the winner.

An excellent game. The game board & tiles could have been a little more thematically interesting. First impression: not very impressive aesthetically. A 'fascinating' 5 x 5 grid of square tiles holds center stage. But don't hesitate to play the game-it's very good.

RATING: 9
This game sounds extremely complicated when someone first teaches it to you, but once the game starts going, everything clicks almost immediately, and the game seems surprisingly simple.  Much like Dorn's other games (Traders of Genoa, etc) there's a lot going on, but play proceeds very logically.  There are a lot of tough choices to be made, and never enough actions in your turn to do everything you want.  The different mechanics - from the auctions, to the plantaion production, to the action choices, to the technology advancement track, and all the different possible paths to victory mesh beautifully to create an intriguing and very original gameplay experience that despite it's uniqueness seems instantly familiar once you play it.  This game is a winner and belongs on every gamers shelf.  I'm going to get my own copy as soon as my game-buying budget re-fills.

12/13/07: First game of Goa in a LONG time... I tied for first, lost out on tiebreakers! My own fault too, I screwed up the last 2 rounds something fierce!

04/20/07: Played my first 2p game today. I was blowing Tyler away, but he came back pretty big in the last round and we ended up tied - he won the tiebreaker (most money). Good comeback, Tyler!

01/11/07: I just got 2nd (to JOE) in a 4 player game because of tiebreakers! That's pretty frustrating, but it was a good game overall.

I pooh-pooh'ed this game for quite some time without even looking at it because I had remembered reading something on the web which made me think I wouldn't like it - something like it was formulaic, similar to Princes of Florence (which got old quick for me). A friend of mine got the game, opened it at my house and wanted to play it, but I couldn't make myself interested.

A few weeks ago I finally played the game, and much to my surprise it was ABSOLUTELY NOTHING like I thought it would be. And it was awesome.

My rating may go down over time, or when my 100% record gets broken, but for the time being I think this might be my favorite strategy game.

So this is where the multiplayer surplus-transfer auction began (2er incarnation seen in Lowenherz and Basari, multiplayer in Neue Heimat)! Choose things to put up for auction, and the winning bidder either pays you, or if you win, you pay the bank.

This is merged with some pseudo Genoa-like system to choose what gets auctioned (which I don't really see the spatial point of), and a tedious Splendor-like spreadsheet exercise to collect the necessary resource combinations to up your power tracks and increase efficiency. It's held together tenuously and arbitrarily by cold hard mechanisms.

Not enamored with my only play (2er), but I'd give it a try with 3 or 4 players, and try to focus on the auction instead of the uninspired rest of the game.

3+2

Clever auction system; excellent game, but the cards are a little too powerful.

Goa has always been an excellent but flawed game; however, Z man has fixed it. Now it is a perfect game and I'm moving it up to a 10. The six development columns have been evened out in strength, so that there are more viable paths to victory and the auction system is still one of the best I've ever seen in a game. Each game is intense and full of tough choices.  If you don't have this version, you must go out and buy it immediately.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Finally got to play this oldie and it's a really good auction game.  The tiles are always laid out differently and make for a variable play every time.  The only drawback is that you need multiple plays to really have a grasp on the values of the tiles, but aside from that it's really a good game that has held up over time.

After another play, I have to downgrade this.  It's really dry and I don't like an auction where you kind of already know what a tile's minimum value is.

I really want to play this game more.  I enjoy it alot everytime, but feel like my plans and those of my opponents arent refined enough yet.

Goa -- Played four-player.  I like games that impart the feeling that I'm building something -- from the map in Carcassonne to the simple societies in Settlers.  Somehow, this game gave me that feeling.  Both Maharaja and Goa integrate disparate game mechanics, but in Maharaja, I find myself stepping outside the game to notice the different mechanics, while in Goa I don't -- My immersion in the game is more complete.

Remember:  Play using the original Hans im Glück rules.  Namely, discard [i]before[/i] you draw (so that you only draw up to your hand limit), otherwise the exploration track is overpowered.

RATING: 1.5
2 solo plays. This is the optimistic rating. 

I expected a MPS core with an added auction, but it was even a little bit less interactive than expected. And rigid. Firstly the once around auction is too controlled and I just don't see a reason behind its logic. The engine building part is also fairly static: just tick the boxes (a.k.a. tech three). It falls somewhere in a similar feel as hansa Teitonica, and yet that one is less balanced, a bit more interactive and hence a tad more interesting. 

Better than worker placements though. 
The theme, ehm, what theme, is there a theme? The spice bags pieces are cute and that's it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A reasonable game, a cross between Princes of Florence and Cities and Knights of Catan. Suffers terribly from wild swings of luck that destroy hours of planning for no particular reason (theme, perhaps, but not an enjoyable reason, anyway).

Like PoF, you need to deal with what you get from the auction, and plan a game strategy around it. Like C&K, progression gives you more vps, better production and more bonus cards. If you like these games, you will probably like Goa.

After a very slight change (no flipping for colonies, just add 4 to your attempt), and no three player games (bad auctioning in three player), the game is somewhat more enjoyable, but still a weaker version of Princes of Florence, and dominated by whomever secures nutmeg early (in four player games). Two player seems best.

Yet another romanticized colonization game (why is the conquest of the "new world" so fascinating to Euro game designers?) When I first heard the game rule explanation I thought it would be boring.

I feel like I have a long way to go before mastering the best direction to go. After 2 plays: 7.

Only played 2p so far but it is a terrific game for 2 evenly matched players.

Tom's favourite game!
We have as many laughs playing Goa as we do in any other game in our collection. All thanks to the Auction!

After more plays I think that Goa really shines as a a 2p game.We rattle off our games in 45 mins. and another player simply slows down the game too much.(and the fact that the 2 others I taught this to were not enamored!)

Creates a lot of tension and a terrific amount of concentration.

No other game like Goa!

[10 plays] I am deeply impressed with Goa. Each time I discover and further develop tactics. Few other games cause my brain to burn as pleasantly as Goa does at moments. I think Dorn has created a brand new animal, and like a platypus, it reminds you of other parts of other animals, but nevertheless is its own unique beast.

Goa is also a tremendous game for 2 players, very unusual for a game using an important auction element.

Every time I play Goa, I find myself halfway through the game marveling at how I cold have forgotten how much I love it. This is definitely in my first box of desert island games.

First off, get someone to teach this to you. The rulebook is HORRIBLE. Dense and poorly written. The game however, is an above average yet typical style German game.

Players seek to manage their resources: money, found colonies, manage ships, harvest crops, etc. The bidding aspect seems to work well with more than 2 players.

The game is strangely broken into 2 phases: the first one is usually one where players build up their base resource productions and the second phase is where they crank up the VP scoring with missions.

A little too long for what it offers but like most solid German games, offers a plethora of options and limited actions to perform them all!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
We play with closed money, and do not keep track of it. As long as I have a reasonable idea of how much money is in the game, I feel I can make a reasonable bid. We are still figuring out strategies for progression, so I am thinking it will take a long time before we figure everything out.

As many others have pointed out before me, the auction mechanic works well even with two (although it does seem like it would be better with more). I like the spatial aspect of flag placement. 

A few more plays in, Michelle still doesn't understand how much to bid on anything. I don't think she's ever won? Of the new games this year, I think the only one she hates more is Agricola.

A game that successfully blends an auction mechanic with resource management. So many decisions to make is this game: from the onset of the auction choices, to how you want to spend your resources to improve your ships, plantations, etc. It's like an unrestored hotrod, it could use some updating in the "eye-candy" department but underneath the hood there's a monster of a game engine.

Goa is a captivating game. It's the type of game that forces you to think 3 steps ahead and just when you think you've figured out a game plan, you're adapting a new strategy. 

There are two wonderful elements to Goa. The auction phase and the action phase. I would even venture to say the auction phase trumps that of Princes of Florence. This has quickly become one of my favorites.

The auction phase is critical to your gameplan. Try to bluff, try to win, but never let anyone know how much money you have in your hand.

It's a game about the spice trade, but expedition cards count a heck of a lot more than spice production. And why is ginger necessary for ship production? Arbitrary, artificial rules bother me. Also, the rules are not well organized. On a positive note, the auctions are interesting, if a little cumbersome.

Bought finally after a long search, with all stores out of stock, from BookandGame on BGG.

Now I've played it a few times, I am glad I got it, though it has more randomness than I was expecting.  The core to the whole game is 'What do I do?  And what do I do first?'  It definitely has that "OK, next time I will try this method' part to it that should lead to many repeat plays.  A couple of th scoring elements seem a bit off to me, especially the matching symbols on left over expedition cards but for now I am just enjoying trying out different things.

Looks boring, but: Very interesting decisions, plays well with two players, multiple ways to victory, theme is not perfect but works. Full of tense decisions, extremely complex ressource management problems. I like it a lot, but it also gives me a headache. The action tiles and the cards take a while to learn and the symbols used are not very intuitive.
UPDATE: The game gets better the more I know it. Once I understood the basic principles of how to play this game and actually started to be able to also watch my opponents moves and react to them, the game became a lot more interesting.

After 10-12 games of Goa, I have decided that the game is not really the second coming of PR and PoF.  It is a good game, to be sure, but I don't get the same "boy, is this game slick, or what?" feeling that I get from the other two games.<BR><BR>

As I noted before:<BR><BR>Goa has an excellent auction system, which allows for great flexibility and creativity in the auction choices, as well as the opportunity to purchase more than one item at auction.  Based up auction results, the player must then plot an expansion course which will maximize their dollars and resources won at auction.  Each player will be pursuing a different course, allowing for even more excellent decisions in future auction rounds.<BR><BR>One needs to realize, though, that the "Expedition Card Track" needs to be part of your gameplan in some fashion from the very beginning.  Pursuit of matching symbols cannot be ignored the whole game.<BR><BR>One distinct advantage that this game has over PR and PoF is the excellent 2 player game.  Even though a 2 player auction is usually quite dull, Goa's is very good, with extremely tough bidding decisions to be made.<BR><BR>I think that this one is an excellent game, but not PR.

2013 update: if the new edition has fixed some of Goa's flaws, I'd be interested in trying it.

[Update2]I ended up trading Goa. Too long for my friends. The randomness in colony founding and the disparity in Expedition card power level annoys me. Down to 6 (maybe a bit harsh)
---
[Update1]: PoF is more of a planning game than Goa, so they aren't really that similar. A game I feel is in the same genre as Goa, and is better is Amun-Re. As I'd rather play that, Goa is stuck at 7.

After three games I'm starting to get a feel for the auctions, and the game is speeding up. This is definetly a game that most players will take several games to "get". Could yet rise to an 8, though currently I still prefer PoF in this genre.

Elsőre megvett a játék. Nem igazán szeretem a licitálós játékokat, a Goa licit rendszere viszont magával ragadott. Abszolút nem éreztem azt, hogy bármelyik játékos hátrányt szenvedne miatta. Nagyon jól kitalált az ültetvényes rendszer is. Több út vezet a nyeréshez és a végén pár ponton múlik ki lesz a győztes. Fantasztikus játék, tökéletes összegyúrása a különböző mechanizmusoknak. Nem véletlenül hiánycikk mindenhol.

Több, mint egy év után végre újra játszhattam. Semmi nem változott a korábbi játék óta, továbbra is fantasztikus. Várom már az új kiadást!

This is one of my all time favourites. It plays great from 2 to 5 players (5 using the extra components printed from the Files section here). I avoided this game for a long time because of the auction element (I'm normally not a fan of auctions), but here it works wonderfully.

Zow, this game keeps me Engaged right to the end.  There are so many things going on in this game.  Tough decisions abound.  This is a perfect game for those that love the "make due with what you've got" mechanic.  I have a feeling this will always be one of my favorites.  

Regardless, I can't imagine how you could possibly play this with anyone that hasn't already played at least 15 or 20 other euros.  Absolutely a gamers game.  The game isn't overly complex but there is just a ton of stuff to take in and work towards.  There are quite a few other game mechanics grafted into this one, but still feels quite original.  Certainly, one of the most innovative auction system. We play with the Roads and Boats rule where everyone plays their actions simultaniously unless someone calls for turn order.  If you think that this is a multi-player solitare game, prepare to be in last place.  Tragic that this is out of print already.

Sold my copy. It seems to be more about mastering the system than about competition with other players. One thing that gripes me, as in Wildlife, is the awarding of VPs for things that you need to do anyway. I'd rather be working toward a clear goal than maximizing VPs by tinkering with the balance of various mechanisms.

As I sit down to play Goa, I become overwhelmed with a supreme lack of desire to review, again, the attributes and benefits of the individual tiles.  So arbitrary.  I'm not one to complain of Euros with pasted-on themes but this is definitely one of the bigger stretches for me to sit there pretending I'm a Portuguese spice trader.  And what possible chain of cause and effect could constrain my choices about the order in which I wish to complete my tasks?  It's a nice build-your-whirring-engine-thingy puzzle game, like so many others.  Back into the box it goes...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This game deserves the reputation it has as one of the classic Euro games. Every decision is tight, you have to watch the board, the other players' strategies, and understand how to bid in the auction phase. This is truly a classic in the same vein as Puerto Rico.

Superb auction game with lots of variety and many interesting decisions. The variable board ensures that 2 games will never be the same. Some expedition cards are really good while some are utter crap, this makes those cards a bit to random for my taste. I play with somewhat modified rules, at the beginning the guy with flag only gets 6 gold, down from 7 and if you fail at finding a colony you get 2 colonist instead of 1.

RATING: 8
First off, I've only played it 2p, albeit four times.  Second, it's a fantastic game, with that really solid sense of completeness like it's cut from whole cloth.  Which of course it isn't, but that's neither here nor there. This is a "by definition" BGG rating of 8 for me.  But I don't own it, and I'm not sure I ever will.  It takes a few plays before you really snuggle up to it, and I doubt my wife would have that kind of patience with a game like this (meaning the theme).

Personally, I love the look of the game, especially the surreal pilgrim and ship cards (Yeah, yeah.  They're Dutch.)  The spices are quaintly clunky, and the auction tiles are thick and pretty.  
Gameplay is rather subtle, especially the auction phase.  In the 2p game, you really need some idea (within a buck or two) of what your opponent has to spend.  Valuation of the flag is tricky, and it's easy to overspend on tiles.  The rest of the game, which is fiddling with advancing your income/capacity/exploration tracks, seems straightforward, but so far it's been pleasantly fraught with surprises.  One constant is that you can never have enough extra actions.  Much like Louis XIV, this game is usually won by the player who is still taking actions while everyone else watches.  Again, caveats all around, I've not played 3 or 4p.  

This is by far the dryest game I've played since I started with Euros.  But I think it's worth getting over that hump if you like meaty Euros.  Oh, yes, multi player solitaire, blah blah blah.

RATING: N/A
Initial impressions, still need to explore it more.  I can see how awesome this game must have been when it first came out, but since then we've had a slew of other games that scratch similar itches, but better.  I think the auction mechanic is still pretty unique, but I'm not sure if that mechanic alone warrants playing this game over others.

Games like Goa tend to be hit or miss for me.  I bought this game on recommendation alone never having seen it or played it.  I can honestly say I've never been happier with a game purchase.  My regular group really enjoys Puerto Rico and I was looking for something kind of similar.  After only a couple of gamesI could tell this was a definite keeper and worthy of my top 10.

RATING: 8
Fun auction-based game.  Each round, after you auction tiles, there's a solitaire element where you ship spices in order to find colonies and increase abilities to harvest new spices, etc.  The limited number of actions and the various spice mixtures required make for interesting decision-making.

UPDATE: I do really enjoy the auctions since they are only once around and the closed economy of paying each other the winning bids. A solid game that has stood the test of time.

I never seem to get excited to play this, but when the game is over, I always enjoy the brain burn I felt playing it.  Many hard decisions, and one mistake will cost you, with two experienced players, in this somewhat low scoring, tight game. 
This game is decided in the auctions, imo.
It is as "spread sheet" as they come, which is why I don't get all that excited to play it.

EDIT:  I do get excited to play this now.  This game is a classic.

I had hopes for Goa. I guess I should like it for the auctions and whatnot, but there's a lot I don't like. The tech tree/spreadsheet is neither innovative nor intuitive--and detracts from the interaction in the auction. The resources are generic spices with no real connection to anything else. They might as well be cubes. Granted, the auction is pretty neat. If it were the whole game, I'd be more enthusiastic. At the end of the day, I think Dorn's games are too long and too bland for the experience they offer. I prefer some combination of more narrative, more drama, or less playing time.

RATING: 7.5
This is my first auction game and I have become quite fond of the mechanic but the actions phase of this game continues to feel lacking to me.  There is no way to influence the other players development track except indirectly.  Maybe what I'm hoping for is the perfect union of Goa and Puerto Rico.  Will continue to play as we quite enjoy all the haggling and badgering during the auction.

The rules take longer than most to learn, but once you play a few rounds the mechanics are pretty straightforward.  Goa has a very tight system and it appears the author put in a great deal of effort.  A very good game that should appeal more to serious gamers.  After one play, I'm still not sure how to approach the auctions, but I know I would use the action phases to advance shipbuilding and harvesting, since you always need ships and spices to advance in any of the five categories.  I wish I would have realized that earlier!  Update:  It seems like every time I play I like it a little bit more.  Good sign!

Possibly the most ingenious game in my collection. The initial bewillderment as to how much to bid at auction when you first play it is replaced after three rounds by the most sophisticated and nuanced micro-economy. Hard to entice new players since it doesn't sound that engaging but once you've tried it you are well and truly addicted.

RATING: 9
BestWith:2>4>3 [Auction/Action, Economic] 120 min. Note to self: If need to replace, make sure to get the older edition, not the 2006 reprint from China.
2011 Reprint changes:
* Pay 1 less (rather than 1 more) when buying your own auction item.
* Player 1 starts with 5 gold (rather than 7).

Tiles:
* Money tile now gives $3/turn instead of $4.
* Colonist track goes 2/4/5/6.
* Ship track goes 1/2/3/5/6.
* Spice requirements reversed for the "refill plantations" and "gain cash" tracks.
* Duty tile (A and B) is now 5 VP instead of 4.
* Two new tiles for each era, so 4 are removed for each era, but no more than 2 plantation tiles.
  These new tiles include:
  * Crop Rotation (A), a wild single plantation, but worth zero victory points.
  * Foreman (A), causing single plantation tiles to improve from one victory point each to three victory points each.
  * Favor (B), select a tile from the four A and four B tiles returned to the box during setup.
  * New Tile (B): "2 colonist, exchange colonists for ships/spices" (will allow spending those leftover colonists).
* Eight new tiles for the "Bonanza" variant/expansion.

Cards:
* "Advance with money" card is not an action modifier (and thus, effectively grants an extra action).
* Three '1' colonist cards are changed to '2' colonist (thus, the colony founding deck is more favorable).
* "Sell spice" card can sell a max of four spices
* A new symbol, the elephant, has been added. There are now 5 each of 6 symbols, instead of 6 each of 5 symbols.
* "Flip an extra colony card" card can be played after you see what your two colony cards are.

COMPONENTS (cosmetic):
* New tiles and chits to track the current round (A1/A2/A3/A4/B1/B2/B3/B4) and current action (1/2/3/extra)
* Stickers to put on the spice baggies, so that colorblind players can tell the difference between red nutmeg and green pepper
* Plantations and colonies now have the name of the plantation/colony printed on the tile (e.g., "Ginger," or "Quilon," or "Crop rotation")

RATING: N/A
I like the game. It's not very heavy, it's not a mind burner, but still has a couple of decisions to make. The only thing I don't like that much in the game is, along with the lack of interactivity, the fact that we can always make your own game. The resources never end, if you can't produce pepper that's ok, you can produce anything else because the result seems to be the same.
The balance on the development still seems to be the goal of the game and that's why I like it.

I tend to ignore the multiplayer solitaire aspect of this game, maybe because I love the theme and the art. I'm only expecting to play it again and again to see if I'll rate it higher.
_________________________________

Played again last night and it was very enjoyable. Goa resisted the time and underlined its classic status. Not amazing but comparing with lots of games that are published these days, it's such a great design. And the clever way the cycle of the money works really shines and makes it worth it.

First play impressions were so so. A huge amount going on without too much interaction. probably will see the auction interaction after a few plays. Rating likely to go up.

Apart from the auction this is a solitaire cube pushing/conversion exercise. Bears a close similarity to Endeavor , which (with the benefits of 5 years hindsight) has Interaction on the map, and a much shorter playtime.

I've just not been all that impressed after a few plays.  Just seems that there are better options out there to play than this.  I can't stand the once around the table auction.  If you are unlucky enough to be put to the right of the guy that always bids 1 over you, might as well not play.

Well, according to the ratings "2 extremely annoying game won't play this ever again" is accurate for me.  I've passed up many chances to play this because I can't stand it.

This game is weird as you don't build a engine to make points, but the engine building itself gives you points.
It's also not that hard to count how many cash everyone has, so the bidding is not terribly exciting.

Nothing particularly wrong with this game, everything is functional ; I just get a weird feeling playing it.

It's ok, but a bit abstract for me.  The auctions make me crazy, because they totally punish you for saving up.  For example, if two players keep buying each other's stuff, and the other two players "save for later", obviously the two players who don't buy anything get hosed.

Right up there for favorite game, Goa combines auction with player development rounds a la Princes of Florence.  The key difference is that the Auctions in Goa are even more exciting, and the player rounds have a certain competitive edge with a little more going on.  Trying to figure out the best timing and connecting all of your decisions into the best possible result is fascinating, especially when you have to be flexible due to the auction.  Can go too long with certain players, but I'll rate them down for that instead of Goa.  Always want to play and expect that never to change.

This game is just what I like in games.  I had a blast figuring out what the best move to make each turn was.  Played this a second time now, still really enjoyed this.

[RGG 2004 (first printing) edition] {Colony, economic; development, auction, hand-management, utility cards; optimal 2 or 4p} A brain-teasing strategy game which is only suitable for veteran players because it's an unintuitive scoring game with small degree of player interaction. 

Rule is complicated and unintuitive but the game system is not complex. Goa is like a scoring game without a convincing theme. It has some luck elements (expedition column and the colony establishment); yet a proper strategy can overcome the luck elements. Goa is well-balanced (with the German rule) and no single strategy must win. Nevertheless, I usually start advancing the expedition column early to give myself more tactical alternatives. The limit of 24 actions requires very precise calculation each time; thus, Goa needs an extremely effective strategy to win and is unforgiving. I think additional actions are necessary to win. Goa is vulnerable to analysis paralysis. Don't play with slow players or perfectionists.

Goa has a unique auction mechanic, which makes Goa stand out from other strategy game. Actually, the auction is the cornerstone of Goa. The money flows from one player to another player in this system unless a player chooses to pay the bank and gets a tile himself. Therefore, a player can decide whether to get money / tile when placing his bid markers. In addition, the EV of the tile and money changes at each bid because of the closed economy, which makes it difficult to judge a reasonable price (I saw price ranging from 1 to 35 gold). 

In practice, Goa is like solitary games with 2 to 4 players playing together. Auction of tiles provide the only player interaction. After that, players can actually take actions themselves independently except for drawing of expedition cards and selecting colony. Therefore, don't expect loads of fun in Goa.

What a fantastic game! The more I play this, the more I love it. A bit daunting at first with so many options and so many different ways to score, but once it clicks this  game is very, very good. This game started as an 8, but after a few plays I can comfortably rate it a 10. I cannot think of one thing that I don't like about it.

This is a classic that I've amazingly never managed to play, though it's been on my "Want to Play" radar for quite awhile. I was a little wary coming into it--after a bad brush with Princes of Florence, I sometimes treat classics with caution, for fear that I will have too high expectations. In this case, however, no such kid gloves were necessary. Goa was an incredibly entertaining game, albeit a schizophrenic one. There are several different mechanics all cobbled together, and yet, amazingly enough, it works. The auction placement mechanism adds a lot of interactivity and tension, the semi-closed auctions provide an interesting method for obtaining income, and the tech-leveling system provided several different methods of approaching the game. Goa is one of those games where you don't have nearly enough turns to do everything you want, and it works very well within that genre. I'm surprised and pleased with this classic, and am looking forward to getting another game of it in sometime.

The best laid plans often get blown apart in the Auction.  Three player could be broken.  Player three and one can pass money back and forth, while the guy in the middle can be left out totally.

But still a very strong game and perhaps in the top ten of 2004 year games.

A very good game. Just short of a 10 rating. The only thing about the game that I don't feel is absolutely perfect would be the bidding mechanism. Sometimes, players just keep the bidding hence and forth with the other players falling short in between.

Update 04/15/2009:
Downgraded to an 8. I am now convinced that the bidding isn't balanced. Players with more money than the others simply shove their money to and fro, so that the other players have a hard time to intervene. Starting player flag is probably worth the maximum that you hold in your hand whatever that currently amounts to).

Terrific set of decisions each turn.  Moves quickly.  Awesome components.  Scales well from 2-4.

The only thing I don't like, after several playings, is that I feel like I develop my game in very similar ways - not necessarily that there is an absolute best strategy, but that there are only a small number to pull from.  I still love the game, but I feel like you can get a little bit programmed.  This is what keeps it from being a 10 for me because otherwise this would be up their with my very favorites.

Not a bad game.  I definitely want to play it again at least a few times.  I'm oddly disappointed after my first game.  While it has all the earmarks of a great game it just doesn't quite grab me for some reason.  My suspicion is that this is something I'd play semi-heavily for a while--maybe 5 or 6 times--and then relegate to a back shelf to gather dust for an indefinite period.  Perhaps my opinion will improve after I've played another game or two, now that I sort of know what I'm doing ...

Auction game centred around resource management. On each turn players have to bid on a number of tiles, each of which bestows a different benefit to the player - some provide resources, others extra ships or colonists, and some methods of scoring extra points etc. Once this is done actions are taken such as moving along one of five different tracks (ships, resource production, money, hand limit, colonists), activating one of the tracks to acquire the associated benefit, or attempting to colonise areas with your colonists. This is key to the game as the player who most efficiently progresses along the tracks will be able to perform more powerful actions on their turn in comparison to their opponents. Victory is determined by points awarded for the progress made along each track, the number of colonies established and any other for of scoring such as extra tiles or having the most money at the end of the game. 'Goa' provides an interesting challenge to the player and the game can take several paths determined by the tiles available at any one point. Victory points aren't particularly abundant either resulting in generally tight games.

Based on one two-player playing, it seems that Goa is a nicely balanced resource management game with an auction mechanic built in.  The great theme is slightly superfluous when it comes to gameplay - not that that has stopped other games becoming favourites.  I'm sure with three or four players the auction phase of the game would take on considerably more significance.  But I liked it so far.

This game is excellent for 2, 3 or 4 players. Definitely the best auction game I've played and the way that actions can be increased is pure genius.

Took 1/2 a game to figure out what was going on.  Will probably take several more plays to get a firm grip on what the various tiles are worth.  Will definitely play again.

Hard bidding, because you can bid only once and of course money is hidden, so you don`t know how much lepf have the other players.

You have your own board, it`s hard to do something against another player, but you must watch what the other players do. For a particular stage of development you could become a bonus action, but if some other player reaches this stage before you, he will get the bonus action. In a game with a ecacly numer of actions, every bonus action is crucial.

EDIT: In the new version you will buy more "own" tiles, because you can buy tchem cheaper than in the old version. 

After one game I don`t know if the new version is better or not, but it affect the game.

I found it a bit "one-track". There are so many avenues to gain VPs that you might as well stick to one or two and keep on those. Throughout the game, I was just figuring out which VPs were the easiest for me to attain and concentrating on that. Like I managed to bag the " 1 Colonist per turn" chit early and so I concentrated on getting all 4 colonies which involved improving the Colonist track. I figured that lots of cash early was good, so I improved the Tax track and ensured that I had lots of cash at game end to get the "richest player" VPs.

It's a clean game, but I found that I wasn't really concentrating on the aspect of "getting out there and colonising spice islands/ports". I suppose the lack of a map contributed to this.

Is Goa perfect?  No.  However, it always seems like something is happening, and you always want more actions than you have to spend.  Less like multiplayer solitaire than other "auction-then-action" games, perhaps as the actions aren't done all at once by each player, so there isn't much waiting - a big plus.

Update - reduced to a 7.5, from 8.  I still really like Goa, but I can never seem to get it to the table.  I've tried many ways of teaching it yet there's always one or two people that simply don't get it.

Great game, I like the bidding along with the strategy of a development game.

The first Dorn game I owned, now I own several others.

The auction to enable you to do certain things during your actions is brilliant, somewhat reminiscent of Princes of Florence (though when choosing what to put up for auction, there are more choices on the board than in PoF).

My girlfriend doesn't like this game, it reminds her of Puerto Rico, and she just doesn't like the theme for PoF, PR, or Goa.  I wish I could play this more.

There is a lot at work in this game of spice trade. Many options to progress on the development track and trying to optimize this growth is one of the main challenges. Interesting auction mechanism that works with 2-4 players. Can be a tough one to wrap one's mind around initially.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The auctions in Goa are snappy and substantial but the analysis paralysis between them slows things down a bit.  If I were in the mood for either an auction or a development game, I'd pick something different.  But for both in the same game, this is the best choice of all.

I can never turn down a playing of this game, although I never win. Why don't I win? I have no idea. I think it's because I am allergic to special action cards in games, so I ignore them in this one. My advice to you: don't do that. So why do I like the game so much? I love development games. I love auction games. I love meaty games. I love games with multiple paths to victory. And mostly I love racing up the ship track to the exclusion of all else. So don't do that either.

This is a good game.  I think what makes it not a great game for me is the lack of transparancy of what's going on.  In Ra I can look over at your game board, decide what is important to you and so decide how to bid against you.  I've found that in Goa I can't really figure out what people want.  This makes the bidding less interesting and makes the game feel a bit more like a bunch of solo games being played at the same time.  Still, a good engaging game.

Fantastic auction game that works great with two players. Having to pay your opponents after winning certain auctions, and being able to only bid once, makes for some tough decisions.

This works better than a lot of auction games with two players, but it's much better with 3-4 because you're never sure how much money the other players have so there are no safe bets.

Update: Moving this up to a 10. The interplay between the two distinct phases - the auction phase and the action phase - is just great.

I've only got 6 plays under my belt, but I think this is a fantastic game - easily a tier above other really good games.  We'll have to see if it holds up or fades back into the crowd.

It's got a funky bidding mechanic, multiple paths to victory, tough choices (both in bidding, placement of the flag and what tracks to emphasize), and plenty of tension with a kind of push-your-luck feel on some of your decisions.

First Impression:

A decent auction/development game.

The mechanics of this game work pretty well and keep the players involved during the whole game. The development part of the game really rewards the players while keeping them racing forward, while the auction part doesn't allow the leaders race too much forward. I also think that the game has great replayability.

The theme is really bad, not that well implemented and in the end lacking.

This appears to be a good euro, and scratches the same itch as Nations for me (although it lacks the theme and falls below in several other categories). However I find themeless games more and more hard to choose to play.

In the same vein of Amun-Re and Princes of Florence.  The auction/action system is one that seems to produce winners for me.    This game does provide me with laughs, when people claim "bad" luck when failing to start a colony.... especially when they were counting on "good" luck to create it.  Bonus points for common misguided whines.  Anyways, time is your most valuable resource, and there are many ways to lose time.  Fun time, well balanced.  Just enough luck to keep things interesting.  It's good, its flawed, but its fun.  The big lightbulb moment is realizing everything needs to be reduced into number of actions, and set the auction cost/want to that.  It helps properly evaluate the auctions and compare seemingly different currencies, that only relate into number of actions.  Having a general guidline for price/action saved based on the current economy at the table, and you will fare well in this game.

RATING: 6
A really fun little game but doesn't generate the tension in me that other games like Puerto Rico (although this game is nothing mechanically like PR even though so many people compare the two) or Louis XIV...I like that tension but with Goa everyone seems to be doing their own thing and what I do doesn't impact anyone else outside the bidding phase. A fine game I'll play once in awhile but would rather play others.

Pre-ordered from Thought Hammer in October of 2005, arrived in July of 2006, and I'm loving it!  It's an auction game but with so much more going on than in Ra or Modern Art.  There genuinely seem to be a wide variety of different strategies you can pursue in terms of how you develop, and it's nice to find a game where you can really distinguish between the tactics of each turn and overall strategy.

Definitely a keeper. I really like empire-building (in the general sense) games, and Goa is a fine example. My experience has it fairly well balanced, with the possible exception of the money track, although my group seems to be a bunch of underbidders, so money may be better then...

RATING: 7
I've been having fun with this game.  The only problem I have seen so far is that in the six games I have played, the winners (a few different people) always use the same strategy to win, which is upgrading the card drawing path as soon/much as possible.  It quickly leads to me assuming there is only one "best" way to win, and the moment a game gets too mechanical, I get bored.  I'm worried that there is only one sure-fire way to win.  Must investigate this more.

This game has a hole in it. Everybody only gets 16 moves for the whole game without counting the extra actions and I know everybody gets a couple every game. However something that has also happened every game is someone always tries for the colonies and misses a couple of times. This is a serious blow because now that person has 2 fewer turns than everyone else. I played one game and the person was unusually unlucky and missed 3 times in a row...Owie! The reward to punishment ratio is just too high.

RATING: 8
[thing=9216][/thing] is the sort of game of "old", when the games had "only" one major mechanic and one or two little ones to complement the other. A time of not several mini-games, but only a big one. And [thing=9216][/thing], though not literally big (it uses a reasonable amount of table, even with individual player boards).

A game round has two phases: in the first one, the first player chooses a place in the main board. From this spot the next player can choose one of the adjacent tiles to offer for bidding. The next player chooses a tile. And so forth until the first player chooses the last one. Then players bid on the tiles - like in [thing=12][/thing], everyone gives only one bid, no one has a chance do rise the amount given. The money is paid to the "owner" of the tile, and the player himself can buy his/hers own tile, if he/she pays more than the bid offered to the bank.

Next is the action phase: everyone has 3 actions, which can be: developing things (the ships, the production, the acquisition of money or colonist, etc) - for this is necessary to pay goods and ships; trying to colonize (Quilon, Cochin, Madras or Calicut); using one of the developments (getting ships, producing, getting money or cards - the colonist are passive, they give a value that helps in the colonization of those four places).

There are a few other things (like when all developments leave the level 0, the player get one action card; or the first one to reach the 6 or 10 points level in one of the rows, get a special card), but this is the basic of what goes on in the game. A few rounds of this and the game ends. The winner is the player with more points, which comes from:
- the level of development of the rows (goes from 0 to 10 points);
- the number of places colonized (goes from 1 to 10);
- the player with the most money in the end receives 3 points;
- special cards are worth 1 point (but they have symbols, so with two cards with the same symbol you will get 3 points; with 3, 6 points and with 4, 10 points);
- points from the tiles.

[thing=9216][/thing] is a great game, that requires though decisions, as with onlt three actions per round, something always will get pushed for the next round, or putted aside. Money wasn't really tight as I thought it would be (as with many other auction games) - usually everyone could by at least one tile, so the real questions are: which tile to buy? Wich to sell?

The interaction among players happen in the bidding phase. In the action phase is everyone for himself/herself. There is no limited action nor blocking someone of doing something. If the player wants to produce, it will happen. If the player want ships, he/she will get them. This means you must be aware of what the other players are doing when you choose the tile to offer and, when the bidding is happening, what the others will do with the tile they are getting. Because once they got it, there is nothing you can do.

Playing time is around 90 to 120 minutes.

I liked [thing=9216][/thing] a lot. It was probably the game in the Top 50 that I wanted to play the most and it delivered. A great game through and through.

It looks so dry with its earth colours and tech tree but this game has bite. The auction system is great both in the way what is auctioned off and how you have to decide between getting money from others or paying the bank the highest price bid. This is a very good example of how games used to be and are not like anymore. Simple rules, plenty of positive interaction and deep gameplay. It is a classic for a reason.

A parking spot rating. Needs play. As a 2-player, this rating could rise substantially. Cool auction mechanic.

The auctions are very interesting.  The value of a given tile depends on many factors.  If you bid too high on an early tile, your opponents may be able to take the remaining tiles cheaply.

The action phase also presents some tough choices.  Do you take a particular resource now or wait until you can advance the track?

Too gamey.  Tiles are clunky and the whole thing is uncohesive.  

The middle auction is good.  The flag is smart.  The walking auction mechanic is strong and interesting.

When I bought it, I wasn't sure about it, and several geeks said it wasn't for us.  Sometimes it's ok to be very, very wrong.  In the first six days we owned it, we played 6 times.  More than any other board game, I like to 'play' with this one.  To date I have won:
- without taxing
- without buying the first-player flag
- without advancing on the expedition cards track
I've also come in second a couple of times without advancing on the colonist track.  
All kinds of strategic fun.

Traded through Canada Spring 2016 math trade:

2 plays: Was by far my biggest disappointment. I had high expectations for this game after reading people's reviews about how it played with 2-players. I found the game very dry with 2-players because many moves felt predetermined and the overall theme and components were very dull as compared to PoF and PR. After a 2nd game the rating at least deserves to be bumped up into the 7's. Theme is still lacking though. Would like to try it 4-player.

A very solitaire-esque game, but a good game. Very tactical and little mistakes here and there will cost you the game. This game also balances the auction phase with the building phase really well. Highly recommended by Rudiger Dorn.

Playing this after a couple of years, I still love this game. A very tense but elegant mechanic. The balance between the auction and the actions is quite well integrated.The tension is delicious

020711- Just upgraded this game to a 9. After repeated plays, this game still comes up great.

072911 Played it again and love it! The multiple paths to victory is subtle and shocking each time I play it. A colonist and expedition card only strategy can also win the game!

RATING: 6
Like Notre Dame, I can see why people like this one. It's decidedly a Dorn design (intricate mechanics with a barely-there theme), but there's just enough bubbling in the pot to keep things interesting. The tech-tree improvements remind me of Hansa Teutonica, the once around auctions remind me of Medici, and turning in X amount of Y to upgrade Z is balanced by the by-now fine tuned Euro dilemma of only having 3 actions to do 5 things.

A very solid game, but one that I'm not going to drop a mint on for an out-of-print copy.

Update 5/6/2017: And yet that's what I did anyway when the chance arose to acquire the (by now also out of print) second edition. Will update once I get another play in.

Wow, what a game, I definitely need to play this more. I've played this now with 3 and it's just as fantastic as with 2. I only wish there were more randomisation with the tech trees, but the auctions is where it's at. And the auctions are GLORIOUS!

A decent example of the "efficiency" game; its main unique point is the wonderful "walking" idea, here used in the auction, which seems to be Dorn's calling card (also found in Traders of Genoa, and I've heard it's in Louis XIV, though I've yet to play that game).  After a handful of games, it still had most of its new-game shine, and finding new obsessions certainly helped to prolong that.  However, I worry that there's a killer strategy in (at least) the 4-player game.  Still a good game for the moment, but it's in danger of falling quickly if it ever manages to get played much more.

I played Goa shortly after Princes of Florence and while they felt very similar in structure (both are a round of auctions followed by a round of actions building up your engine efficiently), I think I prefer Goa a bit more. Neither one is very interactive, but the auctions in Goa are more interesting and everyone is involved in every one. Furthermore, there is so much more to consider when building your engine in Goa and the choices are much less obvious, that I find the down time much less noticeable because I am so engrossed in my own situation.

Anyway, it is a rather quietly contemplative game, so I'll never love it, but it works for me far better than others in the genre that I've tried (PoF, Puerto Rico, Das Zepter)

After 3 plays, I'm starting to figure out the internal logic of this, and enjoying it.  The auction is not like any other game I've played.  Definitely a solid design.  I think it is probably best to use the designer's rule regarding expedition cards (i.e. you may not draw above your hand limit when using the expedition action), rather than the rules as written in the RGG English version. (Comments apply to the Rio Grande Games first US edition.)

fun;  I like auction elements to games so this was great; will probably get more fun with more plays;  have to get your head around board placement for auctioning as a key strategy of the game;  had a bit of a Hansa Teutonica like feel in how you build your own bonuses on your playmat area (ie. more actions, more goods taken a round, etc.)

The theme doesn't come through at all, but I'm a euro-gamer and therefore don't care. The unique auction mechanic is pretty cool, with the initiating player having the decision to buy or pass when the bid reaches them. This creates interesting decisions for the others at the table. It must be kept in mind that buying the item you put up for bid is very costly. Not only do you pay for it, but you also forfeit an opportunity for income.

Not as much like PR or POF as I thought it would be.I was pleased with the plethora of scoring options and how tight the scores were at the end. At the nickel, I found myself thrilled with this game. While the game feels scripted, -I mean there are certain points in this game where I am reminded of previous games- you are never sure who will win. I appreciate the "prison of your own devise" that this game creates. Not to mention how every little point you make matters or the subtle player interactions. Perhaps there is a "solution" to this one but, I think I will get my money's worth on this one. A very fillng and some what draining gaming experience. Also of note is the attractive tiles and board which give Goa a great look.

RATING: 9
An incredibly well-done euro.  This is one of the pinnacles of the form.  Though the theme has been done to death and the mechanics initially seem dry, the gameplay is good enough that even the most vehement thematic gamers I know have been won over once they played this masterpiece.

Why is it so good?  There's no one thing that stands out about it, but it is balanced in so many attributes.  It's interactive but not chaotic, richly tactical but not strategically restrictive, and richly replayable but not difficult for newbies.

Games with semi-closed economies like this one can be fragile, but this has a very strong forward momentum and plenty of ways to make sure that nobody can break the system.  Timing is important, as infrastructure improvements are desperately needed early, but difficult to obtain.  That great feeling of too much to do, too few actions pervades through the entire game.  The goods intertwine in a very simple way, but have a dynamism that will force re-evaluation as the game goes on.

In an era of shelf churn, where most games get sold or traded after a few plays, this has stayed on my shelf for a long time, and will probably never leave.

The endgame gets a bit drawn out and lengthy, but seasoned players can work through the end of their turn while the next player starts on his.  The various ways to get VPs make for a nice game, and the "multiplayer solitaire" issue means that this is a gentler sort of competition for crowds who prefer that sort of thing.  Like Amun-Re, though, there's definitely an issue with the random action cards giving a player a large advantage near the end of the game, but it's difficult to balance that against all the other options you have on your turn.  The last few times I've played the game, though, I've just become frustrated, and I find myself wishing that the game would end, three rounds before the end of the game.  That's probably not a good sign, but I still respect the design.

I'm glad I stuck with this game past the first couple of plays. Before playing this game for the first time, read the rules carefully! On both initial plays we made mistakes that dragged out the game terribly and didn't give it a fair shake at all. After properly following the rules on how many turns to play (there really should be a component to help groups track this), the game is shorter, tenser, and more challenging -- that is: it turns out to be pretty much as advertised. Not much in the way of player interaction other than the auctions and trying to spend your resources better than others in order to get your share of "first awards" in the various development tracks. But a very good resource management game for those that like "build up from boostraps" games with little in the way of interaction (I have several regulars in my group that really prefer games like this to others with more direct player conflict).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Played with 4 players and with 2. I like the 2 player games a little better than 4. 

It is essentially a resource management game where you build your spice trading empire. 

There are 2 parts to the game:
One is an auction phase where you fight for different resources that will help you to expand your business. The player interaction is all in this phase. Making others pay a little more for their items or denying them items is as important as grabbing something for yourself cheaply 

The second is an action phase in which you use the resources you gained in the auction phase. This phase is more solitaire and all about resource management and executing your broader plan, but you do want to keep an eye on what your opponents are doing.

All in all this is a great game with a lot different ways to get to your goal.
I do like it a bit more than Puerto Rico at the moment

This is about as classic of a Euro as they come. When I first came to the geek, Goa was the game everyone referred to as the best auction game on the market. I'm not sure that claim still holds up today, but it's still a solid entry into any game night. Like most Euros, it looks more complicated than it is. The basic structure of the game is players auctioning resources that they then use to improve their technology board, which in turn lets them acquire even more actions and resources. It's quite simple once you get into the flow, on par with other classics of its day, such as El Grande and Tigris and Euphrates.

This game starts growing on me. So many choices and ways to develop a strategy. The expedition cards are just awesome I think. In real life expeditions had a (calculated) risk. Playing the expedition track as a strategy has his risk too, a game can be won or lost by leaning on the expedition cards. Just the way it happened with expeditions in the 15th/16th century too. The auction can be very exciting, if I just could get my hands on that tile....

RATING: 6
New version comments: I think I like all the changes, but after playing, I feel like this game has a fairly short shelf life. It lacks tension.
---------------------
Old version comments: The auction is wonky. I hate to meddle, but I wonder if "buyer pays half (round up) to auctioneer, rest to bank" would work better. Everything else is nice, but perhaps overbalanced, with victory lying in tiny little fluctuations here and there. Luck plays a largish role, larger than the feel of the game (heavy, calculational) would dictate.

And yet, it remains very appealing. I suspect most people see it as "heavier" or "deeper" than it actually is, which may explain in part the ratings here.

Great game with a unique auction mechanism. I love how the money flows between the players after bidding, it really makes you think hard about the price you are willing to pay for something that you desperately need. I don't know about the long-term replayability of the game though - the upgrade requirements are static and this may lead to pursuing similar strategies every time.

I changed my rate (from 8.5 to 7) as I first liked the game a lot, then I discover that at the end the strategy is to loosy to be followed and you play "casually" using exploration cards "a gogo"...

Interesting spatial auction mechanic.   Two player is definitely different - you should almost play with open money since it's completely trackable.  An "engine" game,  although I'm almost convinced it would have been better with a central, shared board so you don't have to squint to see where other people are at.

Sticky cards is definitely a thumbs down,  but otherwise the components in my printing were good.

Just played my second game, more than 5 years after my first one, and the impression is still the same: a complex, deep, rewarding, perfectly balanced game, a total experience. The only defects that I see (to justify a rating less than 9) is that it lasts a bit too much (but in the end u would like to play still one more turn "just to finish one or two things...") and there is too much luck in colony founding and set forming, that is, once again, with the exploration cards. A part these minor shortcomings, Goa is a game that lets you breath deeply in the end and say "Woah, Goa!"

Competing Portuguese spice merchants colonizing India to export our goods back home. Common board setup of random 5x5 grid of upgrade tiles. Cards for ships, coin, exploring and colonist. Player plantation boards also track the 5 progress and scoring paths of ship building, spice harvest, tax, explore, and colonize.  Unique auction mechanics that limit what comes up for auction and the winner pays the player holding the auction.  A little dry and abstract for our group.

purchased 020704. first play 110704. Hugely enthusiastic about this game, minor quibble is that it seems quite mind blowing as to what to consider the important actions to acheive by beginning and mid game and worth of tiles during auction rounds..sure experience will improve upon this for me...haven't been enthusiastic to replay my first couple of games though. UPDATE: 170807 Played my 3rd game and this time as a 3 player. I thought the game wouldn't be as good but I stand corrected. It was great. Maybe even better than with 4. Auctions were cut-throat, I didn't miss any attempts at colonization this time, and also managed my first win! 51 pts. Play time for 3 was 2.5hrs, not too bad play time at all. Would be keen to replay in the near future.

On this matter, I am a complete hypocrite.

Multi-player solitaire games usually rub me wrong ten different ways, but Goa's once-around auction system, tile selection procedure, and closed economy provide enough interaction and depth that the whole package works for me.

Were I to learn the game for the first time today, I might not feel the same way.  Goa, in fact, may be the last remnant of the days when I was open to economic efficiency games being enjoyable.

Played numerous times (with 2 to 4 players). I am not too fond of once-around auctions, but somehow I can stand them here, and there is much more than them in the game anyway. Player interaction is more important than it seems at first, and I like the progression along the various tracks. The main drawback is probably the randomness in the expedition cards (especially when they contribute to a lot of victory points in the end game scoring). Also worth mentioning is the fact that it scales surprisingly well for 2 to 4 players.

Rating is after one game. It's a good tough economic engine game, but seems like it may be a little more complicated than I care for. After a few more plays if it becomes simpler to manage, my rating may go up. Or the rating will go down if it still feels too complicated.

I played it a couple of times with two and it didn't really tick.  However, it plays well with three and, one assumes, better still with four.

Complexity:  probably 4 out of 5; on a par with Puerto Rico, I'd say (lots of tiles to learn what they do, a decent amount of recall needed for the turn order, analysis can get quite deep).
Choice:  4 out of 5, quite squarely.  There's randomness in the initial set-up, and in whether you get to found a colony, but other than that, it's all based on the players' own choices.
Conversation:  I think 3-ish; the bidding round *is* the engine of the game, but after that, you're basically doing your own thing.

Hmm.  Lots of number crunching in this game.  and while its not hard it is time consuming (so many choices).

Awesome game. A great blend of several different mechanics that all work well together. No direct conflict, but some indirect. A lot of conflict is internal: build for later or act now?

The action system works great. Just a very well-rounded game that was a blast to play.

I have played this game once now and it's a very interesting game. I've recently become more interested in games that have an economic element to them. These types of games are also lacking in my collection to date (along with auction game), so I thought that this was an opportunity to take a chance on something different.

While I enjoyed the engine building aspect of the the game, I realized how awful I am in auction games. It probably has more to do with my lack of exposure to those types of games and fully understanding what a good return is on my bid.

From an initial play of the game, I was pleasantly surprised. I'm definitely looking forward to trying it out again soon to see if my opinions on the game will change.

Nem rossz játék, de többet vártam tőle. Sajnos a nehézkes és körönként változó szabályok miatt a játékélmény erősen romlott, és az egyik játékos rombolása se segített jobban élvezni.

Erősen gémer játék, ha a társaságban nem egyforma erős játékosok vannak, akkor boritékolni lehet, hogy a jóval gyengébb játékos mögött lévő játékos komoly hátrányba kerül a licitek miatt.

A licitálást követően passziánszá válik a kockatologatás! Ha valaki előnyt szerez a saját táblán, akkor azt nagyon nehéz behozni a későbbiekben!

Wow. Very impressed. A bit tricky to get the feel for just by the rules, but tons of options, lots of depth, virtually no down time and tough decisions make this a great game! Each individual action seems a bit fuzzy, though, as there are very few "bad" moves -- just shades of grey in how "good" they are at the time. [UPDATE] The more I've played, the more I'm convinced that the order of operations is largely irrelevant -- as long as you make progress, it's very hard to screw up. There are a few exceptions, but for the most part, the only thing you need to time is taxation to get a monetary advantage for bidding, or when to seize extra actions.

This is a great Euro gamer's Euro game.  Dry, nearly themeless with strong rewards for good planning ahead.  The spatial auction works pretty well as on some turns folks feel like they have lots of choices and on other turns the 1st player can really control the flow of the auction.  However I found the real meat of the game to be in the ability growth and action taking of the game.  Add in a mix of special abilities vs set collection from the expedition cards and you have a lot of very interesting choices on your turns without really getting bogged down in AP... except perhaps on big spice harvest rounds as you plan out your turn based on spices in advance.

If you like "tech trees", interesting twists on auctions or dry Euros in general you should really give Goa a try. But for me it didn't have staying power as I'd rather play Hansa Teutonica for the better tech tree or Metropolys for the more interested spatial auction.

Yes, I like it. I do wish my opponents took their turns a bit faster. Perhaps the game will go a bit faster as we get to know it better.

The method utilized for the tile auction is a neat design.  However, I absolutely do not care for the bidding, even if it's just the somewhat painless once around.  Most of the time the value seem very arbitrary, it is pretty much at the whim of the other players.  There is almost no way you can determine the worth a given item besides how badly you want it.  Is the exploration track broken?  Probably not, at least I can't tell from just a single play.  Yet you cannot deny the advantage these cards confer to those who can and are drawing them at a faster rate than those who aren't.  The amount of free actions you can get, whether in ships, colonists, money or spices, simply cannot be overlooked.  My initial reaction to Goa is that it's an overhyped game undeserving of the high rating here.  I may try it again, but certainly would not miss it if I don't get the chance to.

Haven't played a full game of this yet...but what I've played, I've enjoyed a lot!  Takes a winning formula (PoF) and twists it upside down on its ear.  Can't wait to play this more.

Gameplay is great.  Only reason it is not a 10 is that the strategy seems to be fairly similar between games (like Kingsburg).

Very tight mechanics, easy rules to explain, wonderful bidding system, really strategic but ugly, DRY, souless and I did not have really fun with it. The art work is terrible, the board  is  not necessary and it is better if you put meeples for your resources to make it flavourish. I loved the topic but is "drylly" implemented. I would love to give it a second chance but there are similar resource management games,  more enjoyable. I would love to give it a second chance.

Pretty good Euro.  A bit dry even for my tastes, but I enjoy the deep strategery.

This is a brilliant abstract game in spices' clothing.  Trying to make progress in 6 categories and nab miscellaneous points over 8 turns with only 3 actions per turn is a blissful challenge.  Fortunately, some of the actions (and auctions) can grant you extra actions, and - needless to say - extra actions can carry you far in this game.  Player interaction is about as low as Princes of Florence, but like Princes of Florence and Puerto Rico, much of the fun is in trying to solve the puzzle of the current game as it unfolds, whilst your opponents do the same, competing for items you need for your grand plan.

Very clever tight game.  But, special tiles and cards introduces too much special rules.  Very close to be a brilliant work.

(1) Subasta losetas de especies, barcos, colonos y otros. (2) Usa tus puntos de acción para avanzar tus marcadores personales: aumenta la eficiencia de los barcos, mejora tus plantaciones, recluta nuevos colonos, etc... lo que a su vez significarán más puntos de victoria.

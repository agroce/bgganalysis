Latest rulebook:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/dqkpag4pon6ijl7/201en_rulebook.pdf

Something that particularly impressed me about the rulebook was the innovative choice to print a plain typeface in black on a background of white! A daring departure from the usual script or runic typeface in darkish brown printed on a slightly less darkish brown textured background. An unexpected side-effect of this design decision is I found the text extremely easy to read even with my ageing eyes in dim light 
There are nice colour pictures in sidebars and examples but these are only used when they help the rules, rather than to balance the graphical symmetry of the page.

Hidden behind a layer of crappy art, there's an action-packed war game, with a nice balance of strategy and luck. Plenty of tough decisions.

Interesting wargame, with a command system that is fast and flexible. Still new, so my enthusiasm may fade, but for now I'm very happy with this one.

Facila baza militoludo. Mi ne ≈ùtatas la arton (tro infaneca?)
 
Very clever board set-up, use of abstract symbols and playing pieces. The board is rather unstable, and the art is a little too cartoony. The blue units are superkitsch:  a first in hex-and-counter war-gaming?

I could see this score going up with more plays. It feels/plays more like a miniatures wargame way more then wargame board games that include miniatures.

I've heard various issues people have had over the years, but this game remains a very tight and viscous tactical war game.   Not only does it have the depth for repeated, veteran level players (I have played in several tournaments and been a semi-finalist in addition to owning the game) but it is very accessible as both my wife and 9 year old step son enjoy playing the game.  Especially when I lose :)

Was not aware of this game till I read a review on here. It's an excellent sci fi addition to the C&C series. I use Epic minis on hex terrain to play this and its a hoot! Really like this game. Big chunky counters and tactile tokens and cards are a feature of this game which work very well. Buy it.

RATING: N/A
Every now and then, some random guy manages to actually publish a Kickstarted board game with really nice physical components at a very reasonable price. This is one of them. Hopefully the gameplay lives up to my initial positive impression. The rules are a close cousin of games like Commands & Colors and Maneouvre, which bodes well.

It's games like this that soothe a little of that Up Front sting.

RATING: 6
It's okay.  It seems to go for that C&C feel, but instead of the board sections, you activate units by suited cards.

To its credit, the game does play within an hour so long as the army-selection process is completed.  That could take some time, I think.

Ultimately, however, I feel that "wargame" is the theme and not the actual game.  It's a fun head-to-head game, but it doesn't scratch that wargame itch.

Also, the art is horrrrrrible.

RATING: 6
Another Command & Colours clone - this one with just unit counters rather than blocks or minis. The upside is that all unit stats and abilities are immediately on show while you play, the downside is, well, no blocks or minis.

AV has made some nice modifications to the rules to make play very tactical with clever use of terrain an absolute necessity. Command points are somewhat less restrictive than the left/centre/right mechanic used in classic C&C and you get to select your own army which is nice and the special unit abilities will give a lot of variation/interaction.

A complaint is the lack of any hidden information other than the command points held in your opponents hand of command cards - and no hidden information means that luck is even more dominant. Battlelore2 has addressed this well with its Lore cards that can mess with your plans and expectations. 

All the card board bits are good quality, although the art is very basic cartoon style. Dice are engraved but with a lot of blank sides! The rules are very well done.

Kickstarter was well run although delivery again lagged well behind the promise.

Watched the gameplay video, Similar to C&C system games like Memoir and also Conflict of Hereos with some of its own flavour. 

You get to make a few nice choices and is supposed to complete in an hour which would be great. I do wonder if there are a couple too many small fiddly rules for what it is but its likely only a couple, so very small concern. Might have the same issue that bugs me about Battlelore and the like where you can't draw the right cards to activate some of your units.

Fun, quick 2 player wargame. The hand management mechanic is pretty good, although I'd prefer a bigger handsize. Some of the rules seem a little fiddly (which is normal for a kickstarter), but overall a very fun game. One of the only wargames I own.

Goofy but fun.  Surprisingly a little MORE complex than C&C: Ancients.  It's a bit of an oddity and not surprised it didn't sell great, but I got a deal on it and will play around with it some.

RATING: 8
Ars Victor's parallels to Richard Borg's Commands and Colors system are obvious but not actually to the game's detriment. In fact, Ars Victor takes many of the recognizable elements of the C&C system and tweaks them in interesting ways. Instead of a static board with terrain pieces, AV has a modular board. Instead of only prebuilt scenarios, AV has both prebuilt (mostly as tutorial) and a rather clever point-buy system that increases flexibility (possible, in part, because there's no patina of history to AV). Instead of left-right-center as the basic organizing principle, AV uses four suits and an even distribution of two colors and four suits across mirrored decks of 24 cards (one deck per side), and players have control over which units get assigned to each suit (and can order off-suit--but not off-color--though at a penalty). Instead of focusing chiefly (sometimes only) on unit elimination, AV has three ways to score points, including capture-point hexes as a standard feature. Customization is nigh limitless: although there are two factions in the Kickstarter/Limited version of the game (more possible through expansion or print-and-play), there's no need to stick to one-faction-one-side since the counter sleds in red and blue determine which unit belongs to a given side. The advertised 60-minute playtime is not the hook I would've hung my hat on--the game runs longer than that, and there are plenty of hourlong wargames these days, C&C games included--and the art style will either strike you as charmingly amateurish or simply amateurish (I fall in the former camp); otherwise Ars Victor brings some interesting innovations to what was already a sound gaming foundation and avoids being a mere goofball-fantasy clone. (Bonus points for the high-quality and easily interpreted player aid.)

A simple C&C-like game.  Some think it is good as advertised.  Some think, to quote, "In fact, the whole game is quite silly." https://videogamegeek.com/thread/1394746/whats-last-wargame-youve-completed-july-2015-editi/page/5

The game plays well and there's a lot to like in how it plays. The factions and card movement mechanic reminded me of Sekigahara. One downside is that game seems to suffer from too harsh of forced push penalties, especially considering how much trouble it is to advance through differing terrain with limited move actions.

This has everything a good tactical wargame should but really does play easily and within about an hour. Units with varying stats, special abilities, force building balanced with victory points, and variable terrain all make this a fun, quick fight, with a lot of replayability. A bit of a Command and Colors feel to it because units are activated by cards.

Played at Strategicon 2012 Los Angeles, Sept 2012.  Met with designer Stephen DeBaun whose enthusiasm for the game was contagious.  AV had lots of real estate and a presentation video at Strategicon and even held a prize tournament.  Game plays well, seems to merge Hold the Line and C&C system well.  Language independence a plus for me and wife.  Count me in as a customer if it gets official publishing.

Kickstarted.  I'm a big fan of Borg's Commands and Colors, and this feels like a similar but different evolution of the same.  It uses four card 'suits' rather than sectors to drive unit activation, so newbies are less likely to suffer the pain of not being able to move due to poor hand management.  The art is cartoony, but the mechanics are very sound for a light war game.  All in all, It feels complete, plays well, and is infinitely replayable thanks to the variable set-up and army construction rules.

A great strategic game to have in any collection.  Fun mechanics and good customization of teams and terrain for replayability.

My only criticism is that the 2-player aspect is somewhat limiting and two or three good rolls can skew a game in one player's favor pretty quickly.

There is so much to like here. It could have been another half-baked Kickstarter game, but it's way more interesting than that, and surprisingly polished.

Fun unofficial Command & Colors game. The box is packed with stuff, and there's a lot of potential for rolling your own missions outside of the four described in the rule book. I expect my rating to go up after more plays.

Really fantastic components, if you don't mind the cartoony art. Personally, I love it. The counters are large and thick, with iconography that is clear and well-thought out. Also, engraved dice FTW.

Two player card driven tactical hex map war game to eliminate opponent glory. Movement and action token costs depend on the suit of that unit. Unit tiles have fun and interesting attack and defense characteristics and are placed on player banner cards. I like how the icons are used.

A very nice sci-fi battle game which reminds me of Commands and Colors, Hold the Line and Neuroshima Hex mix. You build armies, use cards to move them on the battlefield and try to kill enemy units (by rolling dice) and hold victory point locations to earn victory points. Tense and fun game play experience.

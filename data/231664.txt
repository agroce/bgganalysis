Played 11 games to see whole rule set (all in single sitting). After that I have really no reason to play this ever again. Quite static and boring game. Extra rules and/or permanent rules coming from the deck don't really add so much to the game.

Fear was the second Fast Forward game that I played. After a nice experience with Flee, I decided to give Fear a try. I figured the commitment was minimal since it played fast. Three of us played through the whole deck in about an hour or so on a busy day at the con. The game was super simple and it was neat how it played out with the rule changes mid-game. It is basically a game of the straw that broke the camel's back. I suspect this one would be the least interesting to replay after going through it once. I also suspect that this would be the best one to play with kids and/or non-gamers. It's definitely simple to get into, but also feels quite random in terms of who wins.

Fast Forward: FEAR is an entry in the Fabled universe that allows for easily resetable legacy games. Its a mechanic I really enjoy. Unfortunately I don't recommend this game with two players. Its much better with 3, the best advice I can give you is to stick with the game as the first few are pretty slow

A mix of luck and cards with nothing to do with ghosts or fear this game lacks well game.  I think it was put best as uno legacy.  If you are looking for a light game with little need for skill this is your game.  I don't write many reviews but this game was so bad I felt the need to warn others of it.

RATING: 8
This is not quite the total win that Fortress is, but it’s still surprisingly effective. It’s a light card-playing game in the general genre of Fuji Flush, but it has a bit more meat on it. While still being light and family friendly, it also has some pretty interesting tensions. The Fear is aptly felt as the screws tighten and you try to avoid busting,

Advice for this is: it really wants 4 or preferably 5 players; it’ll play 2 or 3, but 2 is fairly weak and probably not worth it while 3 is just OK. Also, remember, the goal is to *win*, not to not lose. once you start playing to win and not just to ensure you’re not the one who busts, the game is much more interesting.

It took about 45 min to Play through the entire deck on first play. The game is extremely light and repetitive, kinda disappointing. I like the mystery of not knowing what to expect, and that’s about it. The Card play is a luck fest that will lack replay. I do like the innovative approach to the game but don’t feel the need to play it again.

I like the concept of learning as you go - sometimes there's just no time to prepare for game night, and to have the ability to pull out the deck and go is very appealing. The game itself was ok - probably best for kids and non-gamers. We played 2p which definitely didn't feel like the ideal player count. Would like to try with 4-5, but am doubtful that this will have much staying power, though the novelty of the first play-through was fun.

This is a neat concept--no rulebook! learn as you play!--but it's a better concept than a game. It takes too long to get interesting, and by the time it's more interesting, your expectations for the payoff are so high that of course it disappoints. Not one I intend to keep or play again.

After 3/4 games, my conclusion so far is that the fable system is brilliant and perfectly implemented but that this game (at least so far) is lacking in climax or finality. A game takes no more than 10 minutes, and someone just wins after 3-5 turns...

FEAR, a part of the "Fast Forward" series, is a light card game with no initial rules. Instead, as cards are drawn from the deck, every dozen or so cards will introduce a new rule. In FEAR, is is all bout have high or low numbers in your hand and how to play those cards in the market. In introducing rules as you go, it does well enough. What this also does, though, is remove most player agency throughout the game. The positives of FEAR are its unique was of changing the game as it progresses. To get the best of FEAR, playing the entire deck in one sitting would be satisfying to see how the rules change and grow, but the game is so shallow that playing the two hours needed to get through the deck would much too long of a sitting. With everything FEAR offers is seems to take away something. FEAR is not a great game, but it should be played to see how a game without a rulebook can work.

There's a pretty serious rules ambiguity right off the bat, but we interpreted it correctly. Without spoiling anything, let me just say that if you go with the spirit of the game, you should be able to figure it out. There's only really one way to play that makes any sense. That doesn't excuse the ambiguity, but at this point I've come to expect and tolerate it from FF.

The game is very light, maybe too light, but I had a good time with it for 2 hours or so, treating it as a legacy game where the fun is in discovering the twists and turns as they come. In that time we played about 15 games. I don't know if I'll ever pull it out again, but I do feel like I got an enjoyable evening out of it for $20.

As a game, Fear is mediocre. Almost on par with Uno. As a gimmick, it nurtures gamers' craving for the cult of the new with its fable system. Curiosity what will change next keeps interest up to replay the game and drives attention away from the otherwise uninteresting and luck-driven gameplay.

The specific rules system also makes it unappealing to enter a playthrough of the cards in the middle, reiterating the stepwise introduced rules in one go. Fabled Fruit is the better fable choice for this concern.

This must be a joke.  

The reason there is no rules booklet is that the 'rules' are just printed on cards.  Also, games as simple as 'Go Fish' don't need a rules booklet.  

You heard that right. This game is not much more complicated than Go Fish.  There is no 'hand management' and there is no 'system' to explore.  I feel duped.  It's a stupid game. 

The themes of ghosts and fear have absolutely nothing to do with the mechanics of the game.  The description above is completely inaccurate and misleading.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Didn't have high expectations for this one but our group of three had a good time playing. Rules were simple and straight forward and it felt like there were meaningful decisions to be made most of the time. Some of the rule changes were nasty though - particularly when they occur in the middle of a round!

Das zweite "Legacy-Spiel" von Fridemann Friese, das ich gespielt habe. Wir haben 18 Partien gebraucht um durch den Stapel zu kommen, wobei eine Partie vielleicht maximal 5 Minuten dauert. Das Fabelsystem aus Fabelsaft wurde hier weiterentwickelt, und das Spiel macht zwischenzeitlich immer auch mal wieder Spaß, aber dann kommt schnell Langeweile auf, bis die nächste Sonderregel aufpoppt und das Spiel verändert. Dann nimmt der Spannungsbogen weiter zu und ab, bis das Spiel dann durchgespielt ist und man es verkaufen kann.
Ja, mal Spielenswert, aber legt das Spiel nach 2 Partien noch nicht beiseite, denn ca. erst in Partie 3 bis 12~15 wird es interressanter.

Good but light game in the fast forward series based on Fabled Fruit. You learn the game while playing. Thr game itself is quite simple (for now?) and plays very fast 10 minutes on average. It is enjoyable to play though very light, looking forward to play more and see how it evolves. We just played it 8 times until now, having reset after 5 games to start again with another group. Played with 2 and 4 players, better with 4.

An interesting progression of the Fabled concept, but does the end game justify the means? It will depend on the consumers (who - at the time of publication - seem to be demanding an upswing in size and chrome), but replayability will mandate a decent skill level, which is not always easy to put into a new card game.

OK.  First statement.  I lost BADLY during a two player session with my wife.  I think the final score was somewhere around 12 games to 3 in her favor.  (We played through the entire deck.) I would like to think this huge loss isn't clouding my review, but it may be. I will also throw this out there -- this game MAY be better at higher player counts.  I can't say.

That said, here we go. (Minor spoilers ahead.  Read on at your own risk.)

With a two-player count, this game is all about not losing.  The push your luck element of having the high sum total of in hand cards doesn't factor into the game.  We found that winning really came down far more to luck than it did to skill -- especially with the random rules cards in play.  I'd be on my way to winning a round, when bam, suddenly the cards I had in hand simply couldn't be played anymore.

Or, alternatively, I'd find myself without a hand of cards, and end up drawing a full hand of un-playable cards, while my wife would draw card after card she COULD play,  It really all came down to luck of the draw.  Something she admitted aloud and I only speculated at in my head as I tried to remain a good sport.

Are there strategies you can employ?  Certainly.  There are plays you probably should, and shouldn't, make at various points in the game. But overall, with 2, we just found it VERY much luck driven.

In fact, we brought up comparisons to Fluxx.  I admit I have not played Fluxx in a very long time, so my memory may be flawed.  However, at least with Fluxx there is SOME ability to attempt to strategize rule changes by playing those changes yourself.  With FEAR the rule changes happen at random by drawing them into your hand and being forced to play them immediately.

We might try it again with more players, but I think before we do, this will probably end up on the for sale/trade pile.

Played 3 games so far and not particularly impressed. I'm still on the hinge of considering the Fable system a gimmick... Ok, this fast-forward fable system is officially a hoax! Not only does it any fast forward, it's also incredibly irrelevant and unsatisfying. 

A friend and I played through the end of the deck in a single session and were really disappointed with what the game was trying to accomplish. There are so few rules in this game, that it just makes more sense for it to have a rulebook and have us play through the deck with the full rule set. Instead, we played a total of 15 games which took us just over an hour to learn the rules for this game. If I get to read it I can learn and explain the rules for this game in under 10 minutes!! 

Fast Forward is nonsense. 

I would recommend any player to take out all the rule cards, read them and then explain this game to their group and play with full rules right from the start. (I would also recommend shuffling the deck once but not look at the cards as discovering cards that come out is a fun process).

On first glance, Fast Forward: FEAR reminded me a bit of Fluxx, in that the rules to the game are constantly be added to or changed (heck, the game-starting rules don't even provide a way to win). Once you get playing though, it's more akin to something like Red 7--you play cards to try to avoid losing and last another turn. That said, this game has a complete lack of interesting gameplay. Winning or losing sessions mostly depends on luck of the draw, and while a few cards had special text, there wasn't a huge variety and the abilities were fairly standard. The one thing that kept me playing was the expectation that there might be a payoff for all of this dull repetition, but there really wasn't. I can't recommend this one.

The fun in the game is forcing another player to lose. Haha, you lose, I have 13 points, do I win? Maybe, maybe not. But I didn't lose!

The idea is interesting, with the game being slowly revealed and altering as you play. Part of the experience is the discovery, and the possibility you have mis-interpreted rules. Realistically you will only want to play it once but the novelty value is certainly worth the price if you have not tried the idea before. If you have played Fluxx you can think of this as a pre-programmed Fluxx set.

This comment may contain spoilers.

One of Friedemann Friese's range of recent "legacy" card games that gradually reveal new rules as players progress through the deck. Here, players can either draw a card or play a card, and some of those cards change the rules temporarily or permanently. Cards are individually numbered so the system can be reset.

The game goes through a number of iterations, but the core is a sort of collaborative Blackjack  or Khmer type exercise. Cards are played to a shared pot and the goal is to have the highest value in hand and avoid breaking the centre. It's obviously easier to play a card like a zero without going over, but you won't win with only low cards. When a player busts, their hand is removed from the game and remaining cards reshuffled to the top of the deck, so the composition changes. This is probably the cleverest part of the design: temporary rule makes certain card values illegal, for example, which thins them from the deck ahead of a different rule that would have made those same cards unrewarding.

The problems are threefold. First, it's too easy to play to "not lose" (i.e. force someone else to bust) and progress to the next rule change, rather than win, which saps a lot of the fun out. Second, the second half of the deck is packed with an increasing number of tedious UNO-style reversals of turn order etc. And third, probably the most interesting rule is the last to be unlocked, but at that point you're likely ready to call it quits.

It's possible to just play with the complete game at that point, without resetting the deck, but I'm not sure it's good enough to bother. I heard it compared to Fluxx (ouch); it's not quite that chaotic, but there are still too many abrupt changes to wholly disagree. The main reason to play is to experience the "what's going to happen next?". Like many Friese games, it might be utter genius but I still appreciate its cleverness more than I actually want to play it.

A failed experiment. Reading the rules as you go is no different than reading them all at the beginning. In fact, it's more annoying. A game this light doesn't need this treatment.

Each "game" lasts no more than a few minutes. Was each "game" an actual game? Or is playing the deck through the "game?" It's not clear. It feels like more of a way to pass the time than an actual game. We finished the deck in less than an hour. The basic game is not terribly interesting and the tweaks don't make it so. 

Finally, whoever put 2-5 players on the box owes me $20. The game is terribly weak, IMO, but for two players it's just bad bad bad.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's an interesting experience. The game is of course very light, but the rounds go quickly and there's some fun to be had. The most exciting part is discovering new rules and adapting to those. There is an issue with a core rule very early, in that it is worded poorly - at least in the english version. That's just sloppy, and we played several rounds of a broken game due to it. Only when the breakage was bad enough did we realise that the rule must not be right.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
FEAR does one thing really well - it allows you to start playing with zero rules explanation.  There is a stack of cards, and you start drawing cards until the game tells you how to win.  The rules change as you go an new rules are revealed.  This is really cool and creates a sense of discovery.  However, I think this novelty would wear off after the first play.

The game play itself is quite simple on the scale of Uno or Rummy.  Each turn you draw a card or play a card to the center.  There is a hand limit of 3, and you bust if you would be forced to play a card that brings the total above 15.  It's probably 90% luck. 
 Over the course of the game, you repeat this process about 15 times and there is always one special rule that keeps changing.

I found the game play a bit uninspired and repetitive.  Our whole game took about 45 minutes, which felt about 30 minutes too long.  I'll give the game a lot of credit for being able to play with zero rules explanation, but beyond that I have no desire to play again.

Spoiler-free comment:

This is a neat enough system. I've been enjoying it overall but there are a couple of issues:

The main issue is with some ambigous rules. The game's mission seems to be "give this to anybody and they can start playing in seconds" but we've had to halt the game several times to discuss and look up vague rules.

The other issue is that this is almost more of an activity than a game. There is very little strategy and the winner feels like whoever happened to get the best cards at the right time.

Despite those issue, I've been enjoying the experience. A single game might only take a few minutes, so you can play several times in a row as you dig deeper into the game system each time.

I love the premise, that rules are slowly revealed over time, but the execution is deeply flawed. The game takes too long to become interesting. A gamer might be better served by simply going through the whole deck, removing all the rules cards, shuffling the deck, and starting play. 

Also, some of the rules are unclear. In a game with so few rules and where the rules are meant to be self explanatory, this is downright shameful.

We're gonna try the game a few times with the full deck now, but I think my rating is unlikely to improve. Great idea, mediocre execution.

Slower moving deck than in Fortress. Even 20 games were not enough to go through the deck. As most of the fun comes from discovering new cards and rules, also not as interesting as Fortress.

Played through deck stated goal of game not how you may want to play it. Annoyed at the end.

2017 stocking stuffer and family hit.  We played through the entire deck on Christmas morning: ~15 games in 90-120 minutes.

It'll be fun to fully rewind and introduce FF:Fear to non-gamers and other families.  We'll also keep playing ourselves with a randomized deck.  FF:Fortress is up next...

Note: If you're expecting anything but the lightest of gaming experiences from this one, you will be massively disappointed.

While the learn-as-you-play experience of FEAR is fascinating, it unfortunately does not make for a very interesting game.

You're basically going through a deck of cards, playing a multitude of short rounds until the end is reached, with the possibility of taking a break, putting everything away, and instantly continue from where you left off later.

The gameplay itself, however, is sleep-inducingly boring. You draw a card or play a card, with the occasional change in rules from some of the cards. Perhaps this game was to celebrate the 20th-year anniversary of Fluxx, because that's what this game heavily reminded me of. 

The rounds are too short to be engaging; after a while we stopped caring about who won and lost each round. The game is simple, and the idea of pick-up-and-play fine, but it's just devoid of interesting decisions, a narrative, memorable moments or a good time to be had overall. 

There's only so much players can do during the game. We didn't feel you had a lot of influence on whether you won or lost, and the game was just repetitive. Once you've gone through the deck there's simply no reason to come back to this again. Halfway we were already thinking about quitting, but were hoping something more engaging would happen as the game went on, but alas. There are way better card games out there.

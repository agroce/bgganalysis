My first choice for large groups. Also good for newbies.

I'm so used to playing vanilla Bang! and Bang! dice, that I keep calling the roles in this by their vanilla names. This has caused problems...

Still love the game but this implementation was somewhat inferior to the original.  Components aren't as nice (mainly had a problem with the chits in this game not being double sided), but love the IP so solid all around.

We hated Bang, and heard that this was a great improvement, but this just not very fun for us for many of the same reasons. Arbitrary, uninformed attacking at the beginning of the game just feels stupid, and the player elimination aspect is never fun. Throw onto this some powers that seem much better than others, and the game collapses into a hot mess. After giving this several tries, no one I played with enjoyed it. Sold.

Lower production values detract from the fun of playing Bang! in the Walking Dead universe.

Got a chance to play this on New year's eve 2016. I like the walking dead theme and it fits well over the existing bang dice game mechanics. All the characters you know and love or hate. Nice and quick. Good solid fun party game.

I think I am in the minority by liking the card game more than the dice game. I think they are both pretty fun little games. When I am playing with a bunch of new people and I'm not sure what to play then I get this game out. All in all I will play it if someone wants to but I usually pick other games first.

If you are a fan of WD and enjoy bang. This is a must. We enjoy it better with this edition. Comments about lesser quality are true though.
Still it's not a big deal unless you play every day.

Love Bang the dice game, I enjoy this theme a lot but I like the engraved dice in the original bang better. It is a wash.

Not as good as regular Bang! The Dice Game but still lots of fun with the right group.

Identical to the original. Rating it a little lower because of the quality of the dice. They need less colors and should be engraved.

Plays identically to bang the dice game but with a different theme and art work. The question is do you want to play as a sherif or Ora zomby?

I dislike how the Survivor/Saviors names are so close.  I like Walking Dead theme, but I prefer Bang Dice with Cowboys/Indians purely to avoid the name issue.

RATING: 8
Great game but will really depend on the company you keep. My friends and I always have a lot of laughs playing this game but understand it depends on the company which is why I didn't rate it higher.

It's exactly the same as Bang th
e Dice Game, so if I preferred this theme, then I'd rate it a 9, but I don't. And I'm upset that they didn't just produce a cheap expansion for Bang with more character abilities.

I enjoy the 'western' version of Bang!: The Dice Game much better, but this is simply a retheme...so the game is the same as the original, but the theme is different. I prefer Bang!TDG over The Walking Dead.

Simple fun filler. Not very deep but I like it better than the card (BANG!) game

RATING: 8.9
Retheme of BTDG. No new rules or mechanics - just graphical overhaul to depict TWD universe which doesn't affect gameplay at all but.... is a missed opportunity:( 

Components quality is *slightly* worse (e.g. tokens are only printed on one side, dice are not engraved). 

Overall, I'm pleased to have this great game in my collection and I think the theme actually fits the game better than the original cowboys version and... I can live with the components.

Really enjoy Bang! The theme is great as The Walking dead is one of my favourite shows. Simple to pickup for newbies too with the dice.

It's the poorer quality components that ruin this

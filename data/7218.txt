Seems interesting stuff with the mines and ports but they tend to just survive alongside each other, not enough going on with a small map which locks you in quite easily.

8/9/09: Rating based on one 4 player game.  Interesting with freight trains.  As usual, beautiful Deep Thought components.

B&W may be one of the better companies.

Rather enjoyed my one play with 3. It was fun and very fast, 3 hours or so. However, I was left with some doubts about how balanced the game is (coal seemed very powerful), though I suspect that was probably down to the fact it was our first time playing this particular game.

18VA is a short (for a 18XX) game that has a nice gameplay. It has some special rules that make the game different and the card is equilibrated.

Virginia - This is a great 2nd step level 18xx game. Very involved and engaging. Longer than it claims, however.

One playing with 3.  Seems nicely balanced at that number, although there were some concerns over balancing of the B&O.  The gigantic runs of other 18xx games appear to be absent here, leading to somewhat faster play as there is less route calculation.  Differentiation between passenger and goods runs, and trains, are an interesting mechanism.  All in all, a decent game.

RATING: 10
Superb 18XX game that bridges the gap between the longer games (1856, 1870) and the shorter games (18GA, 18 AL). The 5/10 share corporations create a new tension in the stock market manipulations. The different train types and various offboard location types also add a new element of fun to running a railroad. Solid game, but probably not for inexperienced XXers.

RATING: 5.5
Interesting game, nice balance between different trains and routes, but I got the feeling that the game does not develop too differently from one game to another. 


The designer himself mentioned on the yahoogroup that this is not a main goal in his games, so it's probably not a matter of newbie's first impression.

Coal mines are waay too strong, only the 4D could possibly keep up with its income, to the point where buying a 6 train instead of a 5G seems stupid.

RATING: 5
Not a bad game. I'm curious if the B&O is balanced against the 5-shares early. It looks like the B&O starts strong (assuming the B&O gets its first 6 shares sold) but players are only getting 50% the payouts of the 5-share companies. Should make for an interesting balance for a few games. My guess is its replayability will be limited, but after one play I'd rate it either a 6 or 7.

Challenging game that took longer and was less enjoyable for me than 1830.  Seemed to be lots of fiddly rules, some of which we got wrong.

My first 18xx. Also the first 18xx I've ever managed to scrape together a win in :) A nice tight map with a very brutal train rush. Some of the companies can play in a slightly scripted fashion.

I think that there is a bit too many different mechanics for one small-map 18XX game. Also, city tile upgrade rule seemed bit too restrictive and odd. Otherwise an interesting game and I definitely would play it again.

RATING: 6.5
Of immediate interest is the auction style, which is run in parallel rather than in series. The oddness of passenger vs coal trains is ... well, chrome. It *does* add something, it's just not terribly interesting since the choices are more or less forced down the throats of the companies by geography. There is a 5 share to 10 share conversion, but it doesn't pose much of an actual decision.

A fair medium length 18xx, probably most useful as a way to add variety to a collection.

Virginia. Was supposed to be short, but wound up being medium. Coal trains. 5-share companies expand to 10-share.

I really like the variances of VA.  The coal trains, 5 share companies and the length make it one of the better 18xx games out there.  Probably not the best beginning 18xx, however.  Still, a worthy addition to a collection.  *update* I have now played 18VA well over 20 times.  Of all the short 18xx I have plus thus far, this is my favorite.

This is a smaller 18xx game (which in my mind is a good thing).  Plays well with 3 players.  If you like the 18xx game system this is a good one.

There's nothing about an 18xx game that provides me any form of enjoyment, and so the prospect of spending another three hours(at minimum) per session at least half a dozen more times just to progress past the conscious incompetence stage is unappealing. The strategies and tactics of this genre will forever remain opaque to me.

RATING: 8
There's a lot to think about in this 18xx, and though the board is small, it is dense.  Thanks to the light initial capitalization and the rule where the bank buys the last 40% of a company's stock, the early game seems longer and then the train rush seems twice as fast.

The coal off board locations and the ability to token off-board locations to double their value are unique and interesting.

RATING: 7
although 2-player does work (and was enjoyable)  - the game will be a lot more fun with 3-5. As usual, Mr Tamplins components were outstanding. The game play was unusual in that there are 5 share companies that become 10 share companies in later phases - and the cash you use to run the companies comes into the company in different ways. Managing the company credits is a whole new addition to the game play.

RATING: 7
A small but not an introductory 18xx due to too many specialities. Two of the three private papers have extraordinary special powers. The B&O is a strong earner in the beginning although we might have overestimated its strength. The off-map territories (coal, ports, cities) are so dominant that the map play is almost secondary. Incremental capitalization guarantees a quick development with all companies except for the B&O starting as minor companies. The train rush is mitigated by the capitalization rule that all major companies get 100% capitalized once the sixth share is sold.
Our game had an interesting dynamic with the B&O switching ownership twice and becoming a lame dog towards the end. New companies were more attractive with surprising power shifts when they got fully capitalized. One more fresh minor company makes a big difference in this phase. More plays have to show if the limited track-building possibilities also limit the replayability.

RATING: 8
A nice 18xx game, fairly easy to teach to new players.  It doesn't have any limiting terrain, which can make the map a bit "boring" for some, and yet there is a lot of tokening out that can go on, which provides a good challenge for me.  There are 5 share companies that grow to 10 share, good private companies (although only a few) and the challenge of weighing coal companies vs. passenger companies.  A mid-length game by 18xx standards.

RATING: 4
The map seemed tight, but playing time wasn't significantly reduced from a "full-length" 18xx.  Perhaps this is because our normally fast group  had to stop and do some rules checks?

The main McGuffin here -- the decision between purchasing normal trains and coal trains -- seems interesting at first, but the effect is that it forces players to commit to either east-west routes or north-south ones, and those decisions tend to reduce competition for track builds and token drops.

I didn't see anything here that would make me want to re-visit.

Great 18xx game for 3-4. Interesting coal mining rules which allow for extra $ to be earned directly by a company.  Lots of doubling of value of cities.  Virtually no stock manipulation.

Excellent stuff. The game is deep, fun and well-produced. It's fiddly and we had a ton of small mistakes in our first game, but experience should help smooth things out. However, the game is slightly too long as it is, which means it gets played very rarely.

Suggest.

Not my favorite 18xx game, but good nonetheless.  I really like the freight train/passenger train mix.  However, I'm not sure I care for the freight train doubling at harbors.  It seems too strong.  I will have to play this again to draw final conclusions.

Whatever glitches you find in other XX games, you will find that they have been fixed in this game. Its a graceful of all XX games. Our group refers to the opening auction style as "VA STYLE", and sometimes use it in other (pin-style) XX games.

RATING: 5
Has some potentially interesting aspects - freight vs . passenger trains and the associated map elements - but wasn't that interesting overall. There is a long midgame where things seem very processional. Also, it appears that pushing the B&O presidency up to the right price is crucial, given how powerful the B&O is. Since it's very hard to tell what the right price is before several games have been played, it would have been much better to have set the price in the rules, rather than having an auction.

I have played 1830 in PC, but 18VA was first 18xx game. It takes about four hours and was nice experience. I guess this is good start for 18xx-games.

RATING: 7
This is more of an impression than an actual review.  The reason is because I played an accelerated game of 18VA with a veteran who didn't explain any of the rules beforehand and then proceeded to calculate all of the run earnings himself, made suggestions (which seemed like commands) to us how to build each operating round and basically hurried us through the process.  I was not able to grasp any of the intricacies of the new rules such as using station tokens to double earnings, building into ports and mines to collect bonuses and the timing of turning into a 10-share company.

I would definitely like to try this again.

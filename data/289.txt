Lots of random factors but not enough to spoil the strategic choices needed to do well. This is a long game...even in the real sense (as opposed to the german style sense wherein 90 minutes is a long game). Plan on at least 6 hours. But it will be a fun 6 hours.

RATING: 6
Looks like it should be really cool, but Charles Vasey wrote the rules, which means they are ambiguous and hard to understand, almost as bad as Mark Herman rules.  Also way too long, especially if you play with people who want to look at your victory condition cards. Want to try with the Mighty Warriors rules.  Might actually be finishable that way, at the cost of some flavor.

RATING: 6
Good game using the Britannia system for the pre-classical ancient period.  Rules are poorly written, however, and the first game will likely be a write-off.

Three-player variant either too chaotic, or slows the game down too much, depending on how you play it.

How could a small people like the Judeans establish an empire when located between such giants as Egypt and Assyria? Why did some Empires endure for centuries while others lasted only a few generations? Chariot Lords shows you the how and why.
Each Lord controls between 5 and 6 nations, some strong, others weak, each with varying goals and objectives - indeed some of these countries may not even exist at the same time. Players compete against one another to achieve the victory criteria for their empires. Nations quickly become rivals, involving them in death struggles over expansion. Each turn (90 years) will see new countries come to the fore, while established empires struggle to levy reinforcements and arrange alliances. A fine line must be walked between conserving one's forces and expanding one's empire. Too much expansion will see your resources spread thin and possibly swept away by a new emerging empire, but not enough aggression will see your empire fail to garner sufficient victory points to win.
Armies are of a mix of foot and mounted units, along with the occasional leader of note. It is not enough to conquer -- you must be able to keep what you have taken. The winner will be the one who has the most victory points after all the armies have had their moment on the stage. 
Compare with ANCIENT CONQUEST I AND II

RATING: 7
7 with the new short rules, 2 with the original rules.  The developer should be shot for his half-baked original rules which are riddled with errors and inconsistencies.  There is a fun game buried in here and the short rules help uncover it, although they need some tweaking as well.  When you finally make it right, there is a lot of fun to be had fighting your way through the history of the cradle of civilization.  The different victory conditions for the various factions make the game particularly fun. However, be advised that the short-rules still mean 6 hours of play time.

Excellent portage of the Britannia system into the era of biblical warfare.  Players score points for occupying territory and achieving historical goals with their various tribes.  Random activation system is a welcome change from Britannia, which adds some tension and uncertainty.  Tons of chrome, history and good old terms like &quot;smite&quot;.  Seems very well balanced too - I&#039;ve won with three of the four colours!

I was a bit surprised when I played this game. I wasn't aware that it had the same mechanic as History of the World, Britannia, or Maharaja. It's as long as the others. Lots of downtime.

Chariot Lords could of been a 6 if only the rules were better written. I find these type enjoyable to play, but with the length and downtime, sometimes I go do something else while I wait my turn to play. (or roll the dices if am being attacked).

Take a long game like Britannia and increaase the number of territories and pieces by 50% or more and you get...an even longer game.  The element of randomness in country play order increases re-playability I suppose but it means luck can make a significant difference (if your puny people go first they can swarm into Sinai and claim the VPs before they get smashed by the Egyptians whereas if the Egyptians went first they would occupy those sites and you could kiss those VPs goodbye).  Comments based on 2 games only.

An interesting and enjoyable game that is very nicely produced.  It remains rather too long for what is, even under the 'fast play' rules provided by the designer, but is useful in teaching broad brush history lessons about this place and period.  In the revised 'Battles of the Pharoahs' guise it is a smooth and nicely polished game.  Rules edited and clarified.

RATING: 9
Excellent high-level simulation of the rise and fall of ancient empires before the emergence of the Persian Empire.  The usual multi-player wargame problem of bash-the-leader does not appear to be much of an issue with this game.  Individual nation turns move quickly, although the sheer number of empires (21, although not all will be on the map at once) and the number of turns (10) yield a very large number of nation turns and thus a playing time of 6-8 hours.  This did not bother me, however, as the game moves quickly and is very exciting.  The history tends to follow the traditionally accepted chronology of events rather well, although there are a few question marks.  It seems odd that the Mitanni and the Assyrians are the same color and thus natural allies when the historical notes mention that the Assyrians helped to finish off the Mitanni.  Similarly, the Kassites and the Chaldeans being the same color can be problematic if the former aren't wiped out by the Assyrians or the Elamites.  Presumably these color choices were made for reasons of balance, but that seems off as well since blue or red appears much more likely to win than white or yellow.  I didn't have much trouble with the oft-criticized rulebook.  Most of the nation-specific exceptions, which seem to be a bit confusing upon reading the rulebook, become obvious as soon as play begins.  (The desert raiding peoples don't have a navy, the horsemen from the mountains don't have to pay extra to enter mountain terrain, etc.)  The only major criticism that I have with the design is the nation-specific victory point conditions, which are unclear and difficult to track mentally.  Oddly, nearly all of these conditions just give bonus points for "slaughtering" units, controlling cities, and controlling god markers.  The game can be improved by giving a victory point for each of these things and tossing the overdone nation-specific victory point lists.

The Britannia-system ported to my favorite period of history; the pre-classic ancient world. Charles Vasey has come up with some very interesting innovations to the system (eg. random activation order of nations). My only caveat is the confusing victory point charts. I much prefer to play Vasey&#039;s alternative &quot;simple chariot lords&quot; rules, found on grognard.com. All in all, a great game.

I've never played this.  I was drawn to it due to it being in the Britannia family of games.  But these sorts of games don't get played much, and I traded this away for some rare 18xx stuff.

After reading the rules to this game I was worried about the random turn order.  This could potentially allow a player who has a strong ending position at the end of a round to immediately take another turn at the start of a subsequent round.  But I now doubt I'll ever play this game.

Brilliant game, by far the best of all the Britannia style ones.  Great fun and good history is hard to beat. Only drawback (that's why it doesn't get a 10) is that at 5 hours it's a bit too long for a Euro-evening.  Have not gotten around to try the shorter scenario that was offered later; if it's as much fun it will seal that gap.

A more involved Britannia derivative.  Quite a few special rules that take some constant checking up, but it holds some good promise, although the playtime appealrs rather long.

July '17: played the first five turn game in three and a half hours.  I did not handle the Hittites very well.  Quite a few small details to try and keep track of.  The English translation shoud not have changed the location names as that slowed me up quite a bit.  Tough to do the special scoring for all four colors sometimes.  It did not wow me as some of the other Britannia style games, but it was ok.  May be better with more players, but holy heck it plays slower than others of its ilk for some reason.

I agree with all the criticism about this game: the random turn order, the huge amount of luck, replacements, history being prevented from occurring, the bizarre victory conditions, and the infernal bookkeeping.

After some tries with Britannia and one final play of Italia i have realized i don't like Britannia-style games - to much special faction rules and knowledge about the ebb and flow of those rules during the course of the game needed to play properly (Can Oskar the Dane fly in turn 6 or only airdrop with his special elite guard?).

Britannia in the Near East, basically. The biggest single difference is the randomized nation turn order, which annoys some but that I think adds an extra layer of strategy because you have to plan for a greater spectrum of possibilities.

I recommend the fast-play rules, which cut the playing time considerably with little loss of flavour.

This comment is related to game plays using the designer's (a.k.a. short) rules. 

Simple and subtle game based on the Britannia engine, but with a twist: No fixed sequence of play - Each nation shit is randomly pulled from a cup each turn.

Consequences:

- Increased re-playability. [Positive]
- Impossible to plan your strategy on the long-term: You have to adapt each turn. [Positive]
- Play balance may be a problem. [Potentially negative] 

The yellow player starts with more nations than the others and should lead the game until turn 6 or so. 

The Blue player starts with Egypt only and should make a maximum of it! Later nations help him to keep up the pace...

The White player must survive with Elam and make the most of Hatti. On turn 8, the Nubians must control Egypt.

The red player must also survive with Mitanni and Sumer. Assyria is his VP workhorse. Beware of the yellow player, as your VP areas are very often identical! The red player must lead after his Assyrian turn 8... But victory won't be easily achieved, as several major invasions / activations occur during the last two turns:

- The Cimmerians (white)
- The Medes (blue)
- The Chaldeans (yellow)
 
All this should make a very enjoyable and tense game and the winner should be decided on the last turn.

I see two potential problems:

- Game duration: Between 8 and 10 hours, depending on your experience. [10 turns of increasing length, as the number of nations increases during play.]
- As Britannia and other similar systems, it's better to have equally experienced gamers around, otherwise play balance will be (even more) hurt.

Each player has a number of civs that they're controlling, each with different VP objectives to drive people to simulate the theme. To play well, you need to be observant of what every civilisation needs to score points, obviously maximise your own whilst doing so in a manner that makes hard for other people's civs to score easily. Altogether too much concentration and work required in what is essentially an all-day game.

This is a fun "History of the world meets Brittania" kind of game with great ancient historical background. I am o.k. with playing a 7 hour game with heavy elements of dice luck, because dice average out in the long run. However,  I get frustrated with the luck of nation turn-order draw in this game, and I think that I would prefer having a set turn-order for the nations as Britannia has. I saw many instances where the luck of the draw made the difference between a nation thriving or being eliminated. Luck-based systems are fine for shorter games, but less enjoyable in epic games lasting over 6 hours.

Very fun boardgame in the tradition of Britannia. We played with the "short rules" available on Web-Grognards and I feel that the simplified rules, victory conditions and battle segment didn't make us lose anything in term of flavour while enhancing the game and making it faster.

The random turn order made the all experience more replayable and unpredictable, which is an asset (Britannia can be a bit too prone to planning).

A little bit of advice : the game is still long so if you want to make it end in one session, you'd better not losing time (not too much chit-chat). We were not particularly slow (and rather fast in the second half of the game) but only could make 8 turns in the 6-7 hours allocated.

Overall, while Britannia stays my favorite, Chariot Lords is a very valuable and nice addition to the system, probably the best of the games about ancient Middle East (one of the players said it was better than "God Kings", another game set in the same era).

This is a great multi-player game with four different colored factions who have their own interesting strengths and weaknesses requiring different strategies, something that I did not expect when I simply selected a color.  Like all History of the World style games, it is pretty simple.  The randomness of the chit draws helps create more tension (and frustration) than other games of this type.  Overall, this might possibly be the best game of this type.

This game should get points off for messy and confusing rules, but it's so entertaining that I just can't bear to deduct anything. One thing that's great about this game is the variety--during any one turn you will usually play the role of a mighty empire with lots of units and lots of strategy concerns, and also the role of several smaller groups with much more limited range.

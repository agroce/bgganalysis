Spinderella is a wonderfully produced, ingenious kids game.
Every player controls three ants, and the goal of the game is marching them through a path.
But Spinderella and her two spider brothers (also controlled by the players) are trying to catch the little ants...

Roberto Fraga has a reputation as a great designer of kids games, and Spinderella definitely confirms this: it is a gorgeous game, simple but clever, and seeing THAT look on my youngest (4 and a half) daughter's face while she's playing is one of the most satisfying things in gaming!

Great family game.

The 50% of it that's a toy gets a 10, very smart, very cool, and a spectacle that everyone will admire.

The 50% game is less perfect, roll and move... The dice determine a lot of the outcome but that's okay. It's a kids game and the kids love it!

I liked the design (the use of magnets, graphics) right from the start but I'm not sure if I like the gameplay that much. 

Pros: quite unique, nice-looking game

Cons: what's the target group? Moving the spiders is a little tricky; I'm not sure if my 6-year-old daughter could capture an ant with the spiders, however she's not very keen on this. My 3-year-old son likes this very much and likes moving the spiders, but there's not much planning involved... Also with small children, the adults have advantage, although lots of luck is also involved.

Juego infantil, tipo oca. Cada jugador tiene que hacer llegar sus tres hormigas al hormiguero. Sobre el tablero (la propia caja), se monta una estructura en la que se mueve una araña colgante, que con imanes, puede capturar hormingas. Además, hay una ficha especial que permite bloquear a un jugador. Se juega tirando dados, y según el resultado, se pueden mover las hormigas, la araña, o el hormiguero. Si una hormiga cae a lomos de la otra, la superior es transportada cuando la inferior se mueve. 
Sencillo y resultón. Lo de la araña colgante le da un aspecto espectacular.

Played with my 6 year old on a two player game and with my 16 year and my 6 year old on a three  player game and the young lad had a blast both times and the grown-ups enjoyed ourselves. There are some decisions to be made and when your opponent rolls a spider or a leaf, that can be a game changer. The components are top notch and the mechanism for the spider is simple and very clever. Love the feeling of a 3D game. Great stuff.

An interesting take on roll and move, but in a way it did not feel that innovative. Yes the spider moving is cool, but it happened so infrequently in our games (three times in two games) that it kind of took away the novely from other standard roll and move games. To move the spider you have a 1/6 chance and we played on the shorter board so I can understand it, but I feel like the whole novelty of the spiders is lost on the game because you do it so infrequently. It's definitely a game where the more players and a longer board would help. My 5-year old really enjoyed it so I will probably keep it around for her, but it didn't really grab me compared to some of the other Kinderspiel des Jahres games I have played.

After another 2 players, the longer board makes all the difference! Wonderful game!

Fantastic Children Game - my expected Children Game of the Year 2015 - Germany

RATING: 7
Amazing toy factor, with some sly design touches. Kids are drawn to it like... ants to a spider? Takes a simple roll-and-move race game — so there's instant familiarity with that — and puts a couple spins on it. It can be hard for the youngest kids to grasp quite how to use the three dice, as well as how to use the spider, as well as how the stump must be moved. But with kids 6 and up, the game sings. The stump gets used tactically in both a positive and negative way, and they much more readily spot opportunities with the spider. So, it's a super-light but quite clever kids game.

This game has a cool mechanic with the spiders that make the kids have to think a bit on how to get the spider where you want it.  There is a lot of luck with the dice rolls that give a more equal playing field between the young and older kids as well as grown ups.  I also really like the option of a short track and a long track.

Very cute kid's game!

It's generally a roll and move with *some* choices, although the biggest choices [which piece to move] are determined by what you rolled. The 3D element is very neat and works, easy set-up. There are also two boards/maps to play with: a very friendly long zig-zag path and a mean narrow path. (Mean in that it's very easy for the spider to capture players since they will always be in the same area.)

The kids loved it.  It was so-so for the parents.  Not as good as Push Monster, but this one will probably win the kinderspiel.  The mechanic is pretty novel.

I worry about its staying power though, and I worry about taking it apart and putting it back together (ie the longevity of the components).

Cool spider mechanic with magnets, but the game can go on indefinitely, and this game gets boring fast after 20 minutes. Also, when you have your last ant trapped under the tree stump, you lose a turn until someone rolls the leaf. We finally called the game a 4-way tie when all our final ants were sent back to the start by the spider after 40+ minutes of take-that. I wish there was a better game around this mechanism.

RATING: 8.2
Spinderella is just simple fun.  It's basically a roll and move, but there's some really neat stuff going on that makes it so much better.  The "spider" mechanic makes for a really enjoyable alternate move, allowing players to hopefully set up captures.  We found capturing not always so simple to pull off, but the stump really came in handy in a lot of situations.  It's a kid's game, and so I rated it a little higher than I normally might.  Though, even without taking that into consideration, it's at least a 7 in my mind.

RATING: 6
More than a year after purchase my 7 year-old still asks to play it-surely a sign that the designers have hit their mark on some level.  Game play doesn't involve much decision making, so it can get a little tedious for those outside of Spinderella's target age group. That said, just about anyone can appreciate its ingenious spider-magnet mechanism and the theme and components are top-tier.

Totally a gimmick game, but the gimmick is really cool. I need to play it more to see if it can hold up, since it seems very difficult to make it through as long as the opponents know what they're doing with the spider. The spider could also potentially be too difficult for smaller children. But with some practice they would do fine. It lasts a little longer than I would like.

In Spinderella, players race to get their three ants across the forest floor as quickly as they can, but spiders await in the branches above and — with a little help from opponents — one might swoop down to scoop up your ant and return it to the starting line. You can do the same to them, of course, so search for the right time to act and the right places to hide.

Rating is children's game rating (rating for how good I think it is as a kids' game for kids of the right age).

Innovative gimmick on a roll and move game (so the result still mostly depends on luck but that's not a problem in a kids' game). The theme is fun and the rating is not higher only because of the somewhat complex rules for a kids' game - it's really a 6+ game (5+ with gamer kids) while for such a roll and mover I'd prefer a 5+ complexity. Still, it's a very good one.

I'm actually surprised that a simple roll and move game won all those prizes and awards as I think there are so many better and more fun children games out there, though I appreciate the design. It takes longer than it should if played competitively, but at least it teaches children that not everything is going their way. I rather play Kakerlakak, Leo or Coconuts than this one.

Clever kids game, trying to be the first to get your ants across the board, with a spider dangling by a thread, using a magnet/pulley system, trying to snag the other players ants. With more fun mechanics like placing a stump over your own ants to protect them from the spider, or placing them over others ants to stop them from advancing, or piggy backing your ant on top of another player's ant to take advantage of his movement, but at the same time making you an easier target for the spider. 
This is a kids game that parents can actually enjoy playing with their kids.

Mülleres félárú vétel. Nem gondoltam volna, de behálózott a játék. ;) :P
Rendkívül látványos a kivitelezés (ezért vettem meg...). Féltem, hogy nincs kellő játék mögötte, és eleinte úgy éreztem, hogy a félelmem beigazolódott. Aztán játék közben kiderült, hogy bőven lehet benne taktikázni, bár azért a kocka az úr. A pókok mozgatása még felnőttek számára is kihívást jelent, ezt bizony meg kell tanulni. Az pedig számomra óriási pozitívum, hogy eddig minden játék végeredménye mindvégig nyitott volt, sőt a befutó meglepetést is tartogatott, így tehát végig izgalmas volt.
Rendkívül jó gyerekjáték, több készséget is fejleszt az eddig felsorolt pozitívumok mellett. 2 Kinderspiel des Jahresszel játszottam eddig (2014 és 15), és bizony mindkettő vitathatatlanul megérdemelten nyert, mi felnőttként imádjuk őket (a másik a Geister Geister Schatzsuchmeister, ami még egy szinttel feljebb van). A Spinderellát ráadásul én Camel Up nehézségűnek tartom, sőt itt kicsit többet kell gondolkodni, bár talán kevesebb az izgalom/szórakozás. Ennyit a SDJ-ről, de ez már más lapra tartozik...

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]We played this a lot earlier in the year and had quite a bit of fun with it. First off, moving the spiders around, capturing the ants (everything is magnetic and the spiders hang in the air) never gets old. This game uses roll and move as it's central mechanic, but there are still some good decisions to be made, especially for young children. Our plays of this have become almost non existent as my youngest daughter no longer wants to play "her" games. It is fun introducing her to more complex games that really help push her skills, but sad that some of these amazing children's games aren't getting played as much. 

For those of you with young children, I'd say 4+ for Spinderella, this game will most likely be a huge hit with them and one you'll enjoy playing.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]- Top notch production, the board is surprisingly sturdy and the pieces are awesome.
- Another innovative roll and move game (following in the footsteps of the 2013 Kinderspiel winner - The Enchanted Tower).
- This game will work well for younger children (I'd say 4+) but be aware that moving the spiders is a bit tricky and may take some time to get used to for little ones.

This game is a blast to play, my youngest daughter (5) loves it. There's enough strategy in the decisions you choose to make Spinderella a fun game for older kids and adults to play as well. In my opinion that is the hallmark of a great children's game and Spinderella pulls it off. The tactile experience of moving around the spiders to try and catch your opponents ants is a blast and never fails to bring a smile to everyone's face. I think Spinderella will compete with the big 3 (The Enchanted Tower, Spooky Stairs and Animal Upon Animal) when Lilly is choosing a game.[/i]

Great children's game that's also fun tobplay for adults. Very creative idea, beautiful artwork and high production quality.

BUT parents be warned: This game demands a high degree of frustration tolerance from the kids. With my five year old nephews it doesn't really work yet because catching their bugs will lead to table flipping, but it's no fun to always let them win. Well, some kids learn to deal with that kind of frustration sooner than others - just be sure your kids are up for it.

In this game you are trying to get your three ants across the board.
But there are spiders above in the trees that swoop down to catch the ants.
A wonderful kids game that adults won't mind playing.
A cool and unique method of spider movement where it will descend down to the board from above along a string.

A bit of a gimmicky concept but it works well.  This is a kids game but there is some decision making in this too.  Almost a weigh you risk aspect whether to try to slip your ant by or whether to cover your own ant to protect it or another to slow them down.  Probably best at the highest player counts as there are more ants on the board and more piggybacking.

Rated as a kids game, neat twist on a roll and move game. Still in its heart its only a roll and move game

A really nice kid's game. The mechanic with the magnetic is so unique and also totally thematically implemented. I played the game once with two other adults and we had fun.

Everyone loved it

:) Fun and eye catching
:) Fast and easy to play
:) Catching ants the first few times will make you feel like a little kid

:?block: - Should have taken a page from the Tales & Games line, and included rules and such for adults

:soblue: Very random

Another example of how to make roll and move exciting and smooth by true and tested method of THE MAGNETS! Yes, they're cool, aren't they and form the backbone of Drei Magier Spiele kids games and now Zoch follows suit. 

Basically it's like a cross between Snake and Ladders and Survive! - the basis it a race game (with ants) from start to finish and it's roll and move. But wait, there's the trio of spiders - Peter, Parker and Spinderella who try to catch the ants in a similar way that sharks, whales and monsters work in Survive!, only here it's done by some clever use of pulley and magnets that create a satisfying CLACK sound when the ant is caught. The game has some other clever tricks up its sleeve - like piggyback riding (like Russelbande and Camel Up), and the whole stump manoeuvre which can reporter ants, hide or reveal them and stop the movement of those that are hidden under it. 

If you'd call it Survive, the roll and move game, you'd be quite on target. There's A LOT of take that. If two players gang up on one it's highly unlikely (though still possible) they can get away with it. But they could - the game uses unpredictability of dice (with which it also assigns possible actions a player has at their disposal) as a way to create excitement and pushing your luck. My most memorable game was kinda like Cosmic Encounter - the game only began when some players were close to winning, then the gloves were off and only a lucky and persistent one could finish on top. 
There are many way the game promotes risk taking - things that make your ants more vulnerable will also make them potentially faster (piggyback riding or being on top of a stump). 
The stump action - which is 1/3 of the actions (in probability theory at least) is quite complicated. I mean, it's not as easy to wrap one's mind around (which is why the game is 6+), yet it's the most potentially creative. Ant action is the simplest and spider action kinda in between - so you have variation and the tempo of the game has a sort of stop-move-move rythm so that the slowest part don't make the game too boring. 

Surprisingly this game has been a hit with everyone I showed it to. Nongamers - kids, students, adults. Roll and move is accessible, friendly and familiar so people are quick to adapt to it. But then the game proves to be varied and dynamic enough to grab the players, plus it's interactive, very tactile (pulley, the CLACK) and a visual magnet. 

While not as clever or elegant as Magical Labyrinth it might actually be more fun in the long run.

Magnetic spiders drop from tree tops on strings. Toy factor is fantastic. With 4 young kids I couldn't keep them focused enough to finish though. Maybe better for age 7 and up.

Excellent children's game whereby players try to get their 3 ants to the picnic food. Depending on dice rolls, players may also get to move the spiders to capture enemy ants, or the tree stump to protect or block ants.

Rating is for my enjoyment when playing with kids.  This one was a little disappointing, but my daughter really liked it.  It's a nice twist on roll and move, but it's still pretty basic.  The pieces are really nice.  Much more fun than Chutes and Ladders or Candyland, but not nearly as fun as something like Ghost Fightin Treasure Hunters.

[Zoch 2015 edition] {Animal; roll-and-move, magnetic; scalable} My daughters like this game.  The production is top-notch.  Essentially it is a simple take-that roll-and-move game.

Simple, short and fun.  But I hope the Spider an move more often.  We have a house rule to let my daughter have a token to move a Spider once in a game, no matter what :P

Rating 5 for adults; Rating 7 for kids.

Aranyos gyerekjáték, bár a pókokkal néha nehéz odaérni, hogy elcsíphessünk egy hangyát. A fatuskó használata nagyon ötletes, plusz lépéseket spórolhatunk vagy éppen ellenkezőleg, plusz lépésekre kötelezhetjük az ellenfeleket.

A really fun kids's game. Worthy of the SDJ award. Kids love or hate spiders but this game captures the movement of spiders across the board.

Fun.

Fun game for kids that also adults can appreciate.
It is very luck driven and sometimes this can be slightly frustrating. Nevertheless, the idea to move the spider is really clever and the components are of good quality. Altogether, I liked it and I think that some of my friends with kids will enjoy it too.

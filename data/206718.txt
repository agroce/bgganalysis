I really enjoyed Ethnos when I first played it, but as I've let it sit for a while I've really cooled on it. It's essentially Ticket to Ride with a pasted-on theme, and that's just not compelling enough to make a game great. Plus, while the area control is rather interesting, I find a much bigger challenge in the area control of Concordia, which is not too much more complex and yet terribly satisfying.

RATING: 5.5
I was hoping for a Ticket to Ride-ish area control game, but this is very very random, even considering that it's a set collection card game. This is partly due to the way the deck works, which forces blind draws; and partly due to the high value of bands, which promotes hoarding strategies. These are extremely effective if you're lucky, and terrible if you are not.

LIKE: Such a quick, smooth playing area control, and the subtle interactions are interesting. I like waiting for someone to play cards and reveal what they had been holding, so that I may be able to snag what I need. It's an interesting mechanism, but I'm not sure it's emphasied enough here. The variety of card powers really adds to replayability. 

DISLIKE: The card draws are a big luck element. The art is muddy and not easy to distinguish between cards. I enjoy seeing what other players surrender when they lay down a band, but it doesn't seem to happen often enough.

OVERALL: Good game for 3-5 player counts. The theme doesn't bother me at all. Has an ok game build across the eras, I wish there was more differentiation between the eras other than points. Not sure about longevity, as the card revealing isn't as tense as it should be.

An okay game that I would play again.  Ticket to Ride + Area Control + Hand Management.

Second play had a weird combo of races.  Down from 6 to 5.  Minimal desire to play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very good! It has elements of Small World I think - in the combination of races that 'break' rules. This surely also makes every game quite different each time you play. Turns just fly by so I suspect this supports a full table quite well. The single card draw is maybe the weakest part of play? But it does guarantee a fast pace. I like the push your luck feeling of seeing dragons come out and hoping you can get your cards to the table. The production is a bit challenging for color blind folks like myself - pastel playing pieces and no symbols for colors on cards (orange and green are especially troublesome). A bit more work here would have really lifted the game to the top for me. But still, very fun and fills an important niche in gaming given the player count and brisk play.

Rating after initial 3 plays. This is like a better implementation of 504, that actually works, by offering flexibility, limited to a few areas. Mixing up races results in various game metas, some tight and muted, some dynamic and volatile. There is a lot of luck, which can result in very frustrating rounds. Thankfully, even with 6 players, the game moves VERY quickly, and can be completed in 60min. Alt rules for low player counts are offered. Rated an 8 based on the flexibility, potential for pimping and re-theming, will not rate higher at this time due to the high randomness and potential for frustrating player experiences. I don't think this one will get old. If it does, rating will drop.

Excellent and the most pure area control game based on a really interesting card mechanism: draw a card or play cards. 
Scales very good for different player counts. It is also a quick game and easy to teach.
The twist: after you played cards, you have to discard all remaining cards in your hand which are then available for all players.
However, the artwork could be better.

Was an interesting game and had a lot going on for being pretty easy to explain.  Felt like there was a lot of blind drawing (randomness) but the game played fast enough that I didn't mind.

Would play again, but is not something I plan on owning due to having games I like at least as much.

First game had me concerned, we used all the simplest races. Used the opposite half game two. WOW, what a difference a 2nd game makes. One of the best of the year.

Would be a 10 if it wasn't ugly, and if the spatial relations on the map mattered AT ALL. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
1st play: I was not impressed by this game.  Some sort of area control mechanic with drawing cards from the deck blindly.  I'm told that with other champions it would be better, and playing with less than 6 it would be better.  It felt really random and uncontrollable with 6.

2nd play: We avoided the two champions that seemed to be problematic, and the game still didn't really work very well.  We played with 6 so maybe the game just isn't ideal at that count but scoring sets seems to be a lot stronger than scoring area majorities, though that could be group think.

RATING: 9.2
Excellent game from Cool Mini or Not (probably from the "Or not" division, 12 races and not a single mini:) )It's an area control , but that is not the only, and perhaps not even the most important, aspect of the game. It's a card driven rummy-style design witha lot of points to be had from the groups of cards you play. Lots of variability as only six of the twelve races from the base box are used in a game. The games are incredibly different each time you play. can't Recommend enough.

I think this will be played for a long time.  It has a real Ticket To Ride feel to it.  It's no where near as good as TTR, but I really like how they do the set collection and the way you draw cards and the way the rounds end suddenly.

So, so bland, but they burned away extraneous rules and are left with two basic elements: set collection and area control. The result is a fantastic mix of replayability, speed, and some luck. Maybe consider a custom board?

Normally I consider superficial claims about games to be overblown when I see them for myself, but holy hell this is truly one of the ugliest games ever made.

Feels very ticket to ride ish. Set collection, play cards to score points, etc. One of my least favorite parts of TTR (but which is key) is the end game where you are stressing out about whether or not you'll get another turn - and this does that 3 times! I recognize that's an important gameplay element, but it stresses me out. Also: graphic design for this game is butt. Overall, a good game, but a step below ticket to ride for me.

RATING: 7
A simple, quirky and distinctive card driven area majority game, that played in a surprisingly breezy fashion with five. The card mechanics are straightforward and interesting, particularly the mechanic that requires one to effectively give away all the other unused cards from your hand, when playing a group of cards from your hand.  That simply "give away" rule makes for some original and interesting card play decisions.  And, curiously, we had a lot of fun with the three dragon card endings.

On the minus side, the theming of the game, the name (Ethnos?) of the game, and components (plastic?) in the game, deserved more work.  Was this game rushed to production?  Nevertheless, bottom line:  a simply amusing and distinctive game.

An interesting but shallow game. Components are a bit schizophrenic, but not as bad as people say. My gripe it's the excessive randomisation and the fact that VP value for the region can favour players that can quickly establish an early dominance.

Played two games with 4 players of this excellent game. This is a light and fun game. The best part of the game is people's turns seems to go pretty fast. Only when you get about 9 or 10 cards on hand decisions took time. Overall the down time on this game is very fast paced. And sometimes it took less than 5 seconds before it was my time again. I highly recommend this game if you wish a light strategic game with some luck factor.

There is a lot going for this game - I do like the premise of Rummy/Ticket to Ride card play combined with area control and special powers, but I have two problems with the game. First, the area majority score seems a bit off to me, but I could very well not be getting it. More importantly, when you complete a "run" (of the same rank or colour), you have to discard your whole hand to the display, which otherwise is not refreshed, as in Ticket to Ride. This is vastly inferior to Ticket to Ride, as it makes any strategy impossible and makes for round upon round of blind drawing from the deck, without much of anything (true, there's spam drawing in Ticket to Ride, but you can at least look at what your opponents are drawing, which provide some information for strategizing and some 'pseudo-interaction').

I know some people hate the production but I don't mind it. I think the game looks great in person. The theme is super pasted on though.

Played it yesterday with 4 players. I've got to say I'm not as enamored by it as the community appears to be. It took us 90 minutes to finish the game and I think it's slightly more than the game should take (should be as the box says: 60 minutes). Maybe it's due to halflings which essentially add 12 more cards to the deck and prolong the game. What is more, I don't think I will ever play with halflings again. They also make players focus more on set collection than area control. The former is too much based on luck, whereas area control requires more skills and I'd rather there was more emphasis on it. On top of that - at least in our game - there were often moments when players just kept on blind drawing from the top of the deck hoping for something matching their band. Sometimes a player would play a band and discard 2 or 3 cards which were gone in a second. I don't know... after that first game seems too much based on blind draw. I'd rather there were more options to more consciously draw cards. And last thing: some races are really uninteresting at certain points. Trolls' tokens were gone fast and minotaurs seem not necessary in the first 2 ages. I've got to play it again without halflings, maybe with 3 players this time?

This game is brilliant.  It is simple enough that a new player can enjoy it on their first playthrough, yet it does reward skill as the best player will win most of the time.  It also handles 5 and 6 players without getting too slow, as you essentially only have one decision to make each round (take a card or play a series of cards).

This game succeeds at what it is trying to be. Ethnos plays quickly (under an hour including setup), is easy to just pick up and play, plays at a wide range of play counts, and has lots of replay value in the combination of races. Overall, it is a very good game that fits the bill if you don't want something too weighty. The extra replay value bumps this from a 7.5 to an 8, for me. This and Via Nebula are probably my and my wife's most preferred lighter strategy games at this time.

Regarding the seemingly constant criticisms of this game's art/design, the pictures of the board/components make its art/design seem worse than it is. There's nothing wrong with the art/design of the game in person, as it's going for a classic/timeless look. It succeeds in that regard. The quality of the art work is high (without regard to whether one enjoys the theme or not) and the design of the board/cards is clean and functional. If anything, the tokens could have been a bit more sculpted on the bottom to assist in stacking stability, and the board could have been made a bit taller along the y-axis.

RATING: 8
An excellent gateway+ style game. It takes the familiar mechanics of set collection and area control and gives it a couple new twists. One, when you play a set you also get a special power depending on the kind of card you choose as the "leader" of the set. Each game has 6 different cards in play with a total of 12 in the box so each game will play a bit different. Also, when you play a set any unused cards get discarded to the table where your opponents now have a chance to snatch them up. This means you want to build your set efficiently but building a big set can mean big windfalls for your opponents as you will likely have some unusable cards in the end. The production quality of the game itself is subpar by CMON standards since the board is rather small and the art is generic fantasy but it's all functional. Also the turns are super quick so you're only even taking a card or playing a set. Overall excellent game.

RATING: 5
I'm still undecided how I feel about this game. It's an area majority game that utilizes cards in a clever manner. 

The thing that rubbed me the wrong way was that at certain moments the cards on display were non-existent and top-decking or just drawing the top card was prevalent.

For example, in my first play, an opponent played all of his cards and top-decked (drew cards from the top of the deck that were very beneficial to him) a number of cards that synergized incredibly and played a fantastic hand on his next turn winning the game. That type of luck doesn't appeal to me in games.

Anyways, the jury is out and I would like to play it again if just to formulate a more concise opinion.

Very fun and surprisingly easy to grasp, Ethnos is similar in play to "Ticket To Ride", but with area control rather than route building, and special powers for each of the kinds of cards you play. Every game will be very different as the 6 races you use are random each game, and their respective combinations will always impact strategies.

Need to play more, but it has lot's of interesting decisions, a little push your luck, and plenty of variety. Looking forward to playing it again.

Really enjoy the gameplay for this one - I said to my group that it may be a Ticket To Ride killer for me as I found the set-collection more varied and more dynamic. However, after the 4th play I am slightly concerned that your enjoyment of the game directly correlates to drawing the "right" cards. However, there is lot to praise in this game - both mechanically, in the way it scales and scores, and in its fantastic production. I'm sticking with my initial impression of 8/10 for now, but unfortunately I half expect this to decrease with future plays.

One of those games that makes you think, "Why didn't I think of that?" Such a simple rule set, along with some very interesting card powers, come together to make a very accessible, but truly excellent game. Decisions are tough, as you either wait, hoping for better cards, or play your hand, giving cards up to opponents, in order to gain presence on the board or activate an ability. 

It's so nice to see designers making card-driven games without just plugging card drafting into the design as a lazy way to "self-balance" the card powers.  I'm also pleasantly surprised by how well this game works with only two players (unlike most area-control games). Really hoping there's a sizeable expansion in the works for this.

Weird game; this has gotten some love with my Instagram and Geek buddies, but our game felt like there was almost nothing going on - the draft pile got quickly exhausted and then everyone was just drawing from the deck blind;the pool rarely refreshed so you rarely made interesting choices. I think part of this was that we had both the Elves and Centaurs in play, both of which allow you to utilize a lot more cards without discarding, but, uh, you are supposed to test for that stuff, right? Then the late game got sclerotic because useful plays become both quite limited and hard, as you’ll have only a couple provinces where your play matters and you’ll need 4 of a kind to manage it when you’re just drawing blind most of the time.

It was really weird. It felt like there were pieces of an interesting game here, but they just hadn’t been put together. Either that, or the various combinations just weren’t vetted well enough. If the play time had actually been 45-60 mimutes it would have been OK but at 90 the opportunity costs are really high.

Anyway, it’s inoffensive enough and easy to play, so there’s that at least. But tough to recommend.

RATING: 6.9
This is an enjoyable Euro area control experience. It's about building sets to deploy control markers to the board but it has a nice tension in pushing your luck via drawing from the deck. It also has a very interesting hand mechanism where you discard every card that's not in your set. This pushes strategy towards maintaining efficiency and maximizing your set construction via the action economy.

There's lots to like here and this game has gotten quite a bit of hype because of it. There are definitely downsides though. First of all, the overall graphical presentation is lackluster. Secondly, and more importantly, the game really suffers from avoiding conflict. It's a very passive aggressive experience without direct conflict or interesting social connections made with other players. It's less interactive than something like Tyrants of the Underdark or Godfather: The New Don, which keeps it from elevating itself from good to great.

Also not too enamored with the constant drawing of cards from the deck when the display runs out. This leads to swingy outcomes in an unfun and arbitrary way.

I would not turn this game down and I enjoyed myself while playing, but it's also not something I have to own or need to get played. The process of play simply doesn't produce memorable moments or great drama.

I really like this one. A great alternative when you don't fell like going Cyclades or more recently, Inis. As many have eluded to the game features mechanics similar to TTR and Dragonwood. The recommended age says 14+ but I strongly disagree unless its a subject matter thing . My eight year old had no problems at all and played competitively after a 10 minute tutorial. The art was the only off putting thing for me. I know the artist worked on Tolkein's books but the fantasy art from 1950's is dark and brooding and really doesn't fit in a modern board game ,although, Cyclades isn't much better....sigh.

RATING: 8
Rated 8 after one play. This is a sneaky game that is much better than its unassuming presentation. Set collection. Simple board with simple area control. Fantasy races of orcs, elves, etc. Yawn.

But this is a surprisingly fun game that plays smooth yet offers enough decisions to keep it interesting. There's great tension in the decision of how dedicated you want to be toward a particular set, as inefficient set collection means everyone else gets to benefit from extra cards that you dump on the table.

Factor in the variability of playing only 6 out of 12 race powers in any given game, and this one looks like it has some real staying power.

This is an ideal lunchtime game with coworkers. Reliably plays in under 60 minutes, tons of variability over time, easy to teach with streamlined turns.

RATING: 6
A pretty simple area control game of building sets to gain control in one of 6 areas. I feel the varied powers make this game since you play with only half of them in a single game so future games will be very different and that has me interested to try the other allies. However, I have a few problems with the gameplay. First, it seems after the initial round setup cards are so rarely added to the face up display it increases the amount of blind draws and really takes away the fun and any sense of strategy the game may have. Second, you can't move into new areas with your existing pieces you only build up in an area. Part of the fun of area control to me is moving around and being able to attack others, that doesn't really occur here. Finally, it seems to fit in that space where of too many rules for gateway gamers and not enough depth for gamers. If I want an area control game of this weight I'd go with King of Tokyo. Combine those things with the very drab artwork and you have a game I'd play but likely not one I'd suggest.

Cons:

- Some factions are hiding complexity that can be surfaced better. Have to go to the rulebook just to figure out what certain factions do. 

What a gateway game should be. Simple to learn and simple to play. Easy decisions to make and just a few things that need explaining. Offers a good amount of strategic depth for the more hardcore and doesn't lock out new table top players.

Mostly elegant gameplay except that a few factions are hiding complexity in their own specialized board and such.

I have no idea why this is ranked so highly. Pretty simple game. A step up from Ticket To Ride. To be honest, I did have fun in my one play, but that was mostly a function of who I played with (mostly non-gamers). If I took this to game night, I'm pretty sure it would get the Gong. It has one my pet peeves where the start player both has a turn order advantage, AND possibly more moves that other players (game does ensure equal number of turns). The also degenerates a bit, where it starts with a fairly large draw pool of cards, but it evaporates, leaving players with sometimes no choice at all. Feels a little weird. I do like the variety, though. So, extra point for that.

This is a fun area control set collection game that has lots of replay-ability so there are different combos of characters that will come out from game to game.

Components are a little cheep and the board is small.

This is a soulless Euro with questionable component choices--they are fancy plastic which don't stack well. Easily could have been wooden discs. 

As for gameplay, there really weren't many interesting decisions to make. The cards play you, so you don't really have much agency. I'd estimate that about 85% of the turns were players drawing a random card off the top of the draw pile. 

There's nothing wrong with the game if this is your type of thing. But, I tend to enjoy more thematic games with a little more meat.

John Howe's artwork is nice, however.

Enjoyed this... went for an Orc strategy in first round, and mostly got away with it since no-one else noticed. Then everyone else tried it, so no-one really got much more. Didn't do so well with the area control, but got enough points to be in contention at least. Third round ended rather abruptly (all 3 dragons appeared toghether) so most of us had cards ready to lay.

Boy is this game over-hyped.  This is a complete luck fest.  There is virtual no control over what happens in this game.  You just travel down a path and hope for the best.  If you top-deck well, you have a good shot at winning.   I can't believe people are heaping love on this game.  I mean, for a game of total luck, I suppose it isn't bad...but anyone trying to say this is a strategy game is fooling themselves.

Keeps dropping.  5 --> 4.  I dont get why ppl like this top deck random game.  Why not deal a card to everyone and high card wins?  Next game up!

RATING: 8
Players recruit fantasy themed tribe cards into their hands, or play a "band" or tribe cards to potentially place a control token on the board.  At the end of a deck, control tokens score area majorities.  A seemingly bland drafting cards based area majority game is actually quite good, due to clean mechanics, fast paced play, and the fact that every band played needs a leader, who provides a rule breaking power.  Any cards not in the played band must be discarded from a player's hand into the draft, adding to the agony.  Pretty neat little game.

There are interesting ideas here but it's really hurt by the presentation, and I don't mean the choice of generic fantasy rendered in browns. The visual design of the cards emphasizes the wrong information - faction should be the easiest thing to see across the table, not territory - and half the tokens have the same color value. A game released by a major publisher in 2017 should not do this poor a job at communicating the game state visually.

Solid game, more of a set collection game than an area control; large variability with the different races. What it loses in absolute lack of theme, and blandness of affect, it makes up for in ease of teaching and little down time. Drawing from the top of the deck can be a drag. Overall I really liked it as an decent area control gateway with a versatile player count, it gave me that feeling of having played more game than I had in the time as your turns come round so quick, similar to some rondel games and century spice road.

Addendum: Ultimately its not particularly exciting,and though I wouldn't turn down a game with you later, I don't feel the need to own it.

A CMON game that was not published as a Kickstarter but blew most recent Kickstarters out of the water.

It's a quick gateway game into area control with some set collection aspects of Ticket To Ride.

It's so much fun that my gaming group constantly is constantly begging me to bring it along.

Randomly drawing six races out of 12 (13 with the promo) adds some nice replayability  to the game.

The components could be a bit better considering the game's price but hey, it's the gameplay that counts.

The game comes with a well designed tray that sadly FAILS when you want to sleeve the cards. This should not happen to a veteran company.

An area control game (at heart) driven by a rummy engine.  (Thurn and Taxis is a good comparison here).   There is a nice mix of races and abilities.   I was a little disappointed with the amount of ties that occur in scoring, but perhaps more players and/or Trolls will solve that.   Plays very quickly, but there can be (not always) a crap-ton of top-decking that is going to be contentious for some players.   Has stood up to multiple plays without getting old - the variability is excellent.  (Pro Tip:  remove the Elves from the game, they break the utility of the card display.)

The game has gotten hammered for the graphical presentation, and I think that is unfair.  Yes, it has a very dated early 90s look....  but I think that feels fresh at this point in gaming where every single Mayfair/Lookout game looks EXACTLY THE SAME.   I'm sick and tired of cartoon figures with heavy shading gradients.  Blech.   Ethnos slaps that in the face.  The John Howe artwork is fantastic.   The corner icons on the cards would be more clear without the triangle frame - that was a bad choice by CMON.   Same goes for the cool-looking plastic bits.  They don't stack well and are pretty unstable.   That's not really excusable for a plastics-based company to get that wrong.   The colors are awesome, though.

David Doust - if you see this, you still owe me $80 from New Wave unfulfilled orders.  I have avoided CMON games up until now for that reason, but Ethnos drew me in.

Oh my.  TtR finally getting upended... the mechanic of discarding the rest of your hand after playing a band along with assigning a leader is brilliant.  Just a great design.

If only CMON would have gotten remotely close in their art/design direction with the feel and weight of the gameplay.  The game is brilliant but the wrapper is just off on many levels... personally believe this is a gateway GOLD MINE should they decide to re-wrap this with a lighter vibe and get rid of the pastel control markers.

RATING: 6
[thing=206718][/thing] has been heralded as a new Ticket to Ride, an area majority gateway game.  It is a little too complex to be a true gateway game, and has a truly dreadful generic fantasy theme which would make any non-gamers I know run a million miles.  

(Personal rant time: When will publishers begin to realise that the general public do not like Fantasy?  If you want a game to have broad appeal in a wider market use a theme people can relate to.  This game could be animals in a forest, nations on a map, groups of people in coffee shops, anything would be better than what is presented here.  I know in the world of BGG Fantasy is a popular theme, but believe me, it does not resonate in the wider world.) 

The game play is smooth, if rather bland.  All the rough edges have been rounded off to the extent that there is not a lot of bite left. The artwork and components are appalling, with cheap plastic bits and an uninspiring map on the board.

Nonetheless it is has much to recommend it: it is short (an hour or so), turns go very quickly so it plays with 6 with little downtime, and there are enough decisions to make it interesting, if ultimately there is too much luck to make it [i]that[/i] interesting.

Many people call Ethnos the Ticket to Ride of Area Control games. While I understand that sentiment, I still feel Web of Power is more apt to that description. I think Ethnos' best aspect, is the fact that the game comes with 12 races which distinctly change the game and you only use 6 each game. This makes the replay value of this game massive. Additionally, it makes the game easily expandable. The turns are simple. You just draw a card or play cards. There is a nice feeling of push-your-luck tension near the end of each age. I say this because there are 3 dragon cards at the bottom of half of the deck and when the third dragon is drawn, the age immediately ends. Though, there are some aspects that I'm not so fussy on. First, when all the cards have been drafted from the display, you draw random cards from the top of the deck. This happens quite often, making the luck of the draw quite pronounced. Second, the map and graphic design are pretty mediocre. I do love the illustrations however. I think this is going to be a great gateway game for some people. For me, it's good but not great.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Ethnos is essentially a set collecting card game with two suits and card abilities unique to each suit. Play is quick and has a great push-your-luck or bust element. Everything works for a clean card game, so it is too bad this needed a board to play for the added territory control scoring. I'm not against this, but egads the look of the board and garish card desgin took my rating down a notch.

In the end, Ethnos is solid to play, but I wasn't sure it offered much beyond other smaller and cheaper card games.

Set collection with some area control and pasted on races with no real theme.  Big deal.  If you want the Ticket to Ride of area control games, come up with a better pasted on theme.

Most of my turns were simply taking a card off the top of the deck, and hoping someone else would play a set and have to discard a bunch of cards that I needed.

Nothing that would make me want to come back again.

The more I think about this game, the less I liked it. I think it's too random & the card row doesn't work the way I think it was intended.

I don't think the races are as important as dumb luck of the draw.

This game's essence, is rummy. A wonderfully new interpretation of it, but it's still, a card drawing game. If you like waiting on lucky card draws, trying to decide when to cut your losses or whether your discards will help others, this game is for you. 

On the plus side:
*In addition to set collection, there's also an area majority mechanic that is significant. It requires ever luckier draws to get the area majorities, but it adds a risk/reward element to your decision
* Suits have powers that affect what you are trying to get
* Some suits or suit combinations mitigate or improve upon the rummy aspect
* Turns should be quick
* Replayability is high
* Expandability is high, and I'm sure they will do this

On the down side:
* Cards are very poor quality, which is a horrible thing in a card game. Add sleeves to the price if you're considering buying.
* Cards are not very well designed to see at a glance the two aspects (region/faction)
* The luck aspect is pretty significant. By the second age, you'll typically be waiting for a usable card once your hand takes shape
* Some starting suits or suit combinations work poorly and strip down the game rather than augment it
* Takes a lot longer than 3 hands of rummy, and requires some set up/tear down

Overall, this is a much-enhanced version of rummy, which I don't really enjoy. The enhancements add depth, and play time, without mitigating the weaknesses very well (although some combinations of starting factions actually work well together). As a light card game, you almost need sleeves because of the poor card quality, so it's pretty expensive for what it is. Still, there's a game here, and if this kind of card game is your thing, I could recommend you check it out even though it's not to my taste.

RATING: 6
Kind of a classic rummy game with sets used for area control and for direct points.  Different "races" instead of suits have special powers and the box contains a bit more than is played with at a single time.  

Many will love and appreciate this but I don't particularly enjoy games with traditional cardplay like trick taking or rummy style set collection.

RATING: N/A
Pretty basic area control game, but the set collection and the fact that you might get fewer points in later turns adds some nice depth. It's pretty great that a game can be knocked out in an hour as well.

I wanted to like this game. I like area control, I like fantasy. But what I don't like is too much luck. And this game is 80-90% luck. For example, the centaur card lets you play another card, it's like you get another turn. If you're not lucky, you never get one and have several turns less than others. This game is just about drawing cards, luck, luck, luck, yuck!

Fun, weird mix of generic fantasy rummy and area control. Even the art clashes a bit with the painterly illustrations on the cards and the bland, tiny board & generic tokens. Still though, it was fun and reminded me how I like these games even though I am TERRIBLE at them. Makes me want to revisit El Grande and China.

RATING: 7.5
EDIT: After 10+ plays this game is starting to show its flaws. The turn order advantage is way too impactful, most games play out the same and the area control part of the game is simply much weaker than the big band portion due to the point reward from areas being too low. The last point is the one that made me lower its rating, because the "correct" way to play this game is to just keep hoarding cards until you get big bands, which is not that interesting or interactive and is also more luck-driven than all of the other aspects of the game.

This game kills Ticket to Ride for me. They both have cards of different colours with a central market and you play cards to advance your position on a board. Ethnos differs by managing to get rid of the things that I find most annoying in TtR. There's a hand limit, so you don't sit around with 30 card hands. The market row isn't random, it's made up by the cards your opponents discard. All points are open, so you don't get blocked by random. Above all, the cards have several uses, so you're never stuck with an entirely useless hand. 

The rules are simple yet the game has depth. It plays super quickly, turns take 5 seconds and you can easily play the game in 30 minutes. The card play isn't particularly unique or interesting and the area control part is very basic, but combined together with the many different special powers and the undetermined age length it all forms a wonderfully engaging game. With this and Libertalia, Paolo Mori is quickly becoming my favourite designer.

My one complaint and the reason I don't have it in my collection is that the art design is flat out ugly. Sure, I didn't notice it quite as much while playing and it is functional, but the bright neon player discs on the drab, tiny map and the cards with serious art pasted on top of a rectangle of colour with no attempt at all to make those rectangles interesting just feels wrong. It's a great game and CMON is the publisher, I expected a lot more. I feel sorry for Paolo and his beautiful design and for John Howe and his beautiful art that was mishandled in this way.

Very simple rummy-style, set-collection, area majority game. Different factions allow you to break or augment the rules.

Glad I got to try before a buy. It was a good game and I wouldn't mind playing again, but not a buy for me - just a little milquetoast from theme to mechanics. While well done, it's like if every decent game was averaged together, this is what you'd get. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's a well-designed game. Very abstract with theme completely pasted on. The push-your-luck mechanism when taking cards has some interesting dynamics, especially toward the end of the game, but ultimately is less interesting than I had hoped. There isn't that much of a feel of having to worry about what opponents will do with your discards because just trying to achieve your own goals seems to override most other considerations. It would be nice if there were some compensation for the gamble of taking cards and receiving something that you can't really use; as it is, it feels like a lost turn when it happens.

My main knock against the game is that it is ultimately very hard to to get into your hand the cards you want—which is an odd choice for an area control game based on playing cards. The band mechanism balances that out a bit and does offer an alternative VP path, but overall it's fairly random with a predominantly tactical feel, which is fine for what it is and for its length. The key to the game seems to be to play reactively with what you are able to muster rather than trying to plan ahead too much.

RATING: 6
Every time I see the box cover for this game I think, "Oh yeah, that sweet game about fantasy races battling to the death... awesome!"  Then someone opens the box and I groan, remembering  what the game actually is.   

It's not that Ethnos is a bad game.  Its game mechanics can actually be very sharp and fast.  It's a good, lean design.  The problem is, it's just such a bland, ugly game that I can never get excited about actually playing it.  The gorgeous box art looks like a fantastic game of fantasy battles, but the actual game is just set collection and placing really lame "control tokens" on the board.   The oversized rulebook, filled with distracting quotes from the various fantasy races involved in the "battle," is just embarrassing.   

Admittedly, some of the games I enjoy are a triumph of style over substance.  Ethnos is like the opposite of that.   It's like kids flailing cardboard swords at each other shouting "we're having a battle!"  No, you're not.  You're playing Ticket to Ride.

For those who are skeptical of its fantasy genre, the box art will do it the most disservice.  It plays as a game that could well be played with people who don't like the fantasy genre, and for those who are looking for it, it will contain enough fantasy to keep them entertained; but this game is area control simplified down to a very simple core: Pick up a card and put a marker on the board.  This is a gateway game to draw new people into the hobby, but a box art filled with pictures of werewolves and skeletons might just unfairly push them away.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Enjoyable game with familiar mechanics of area control and set collection. The rules are surprisingly simple and elegant: on your turn, take a card or play a set. When you do the latter, you must discard the rest of your hand to the open pool, from where any players can take them. The various races with their unique special powers add interest and, as you use only half of them per game, replayability. However, luck of the draw is huge and potentially decisive, as the open pool is empty most of the time, forcing players to draw blindly from the deck, with no way to mitigate randomness. The game seriously needs a variant imposing a minimum number of open cards at all times.

RATING: 6.8
First impression rating: good game, not a great game. It plays quickly and the depth is just about right for the length. Different races/factions look like they will add enough replayability for most players but I'd need a couple more games under my belt to decide for sure.

It's an OK game. Each turn is quick, but sometimes you won't have a lot of choice for a few rounds which will be a bit boring. The art direction in this game is non existent.

The number of different races makes the game feel somewhat different every time which is a good thing.

After one play.... OMG this game seems amazing! First game was engaging, fun and tense in the right way.... Best of Mori in my opinion!

Update: of all the races, I think the Centaurs is the race that can make the game way more random, simply by the fact that fewer cards get "discarded" to the market for others to choose from. Basically this makes the luck of the draw from the draw pile very much an issue... Lowering my rating 0.5 because of this...

It's fun quick game but it's a pain to teach because of all the different rules you need to explain. I really enjoy the push your luck of the dragons in the deck. However, I don't like how obtuse it is to figure out what to do. It almost feels like any strategy is a valid strategy and determining which one is the best is hard to do since they all seem so closely pointed. I'm sure this gets better with more plays as you understand the strengths and weaknesses of all the races and then can better gauge the combinations.

RATING: 7
The game is mostly good. Very light, family weight area control/set collection game. After repeated plays however, I have started to see some of the flaws in the game. The game is heavily dependent on luck, much more than I like. You have one of two actions you may play during your turn: Draw 1 card, or play a band. Problem is, in the draw pile you have three dragons cards, and once the third is drawn, the round ends and you must discard any unplayed cards. So if you were holding out for a huge band, you may get shafted.  

You are at the mercy of the draw pile, and yes when other players play bands the cards you need may show up, but what are the chances for that. But even with that the game is short, and is very easy to learn, which makes it still a "good" game. However I think I need something with just a little more punch, and more control.

RATING: 6.9
It's not a really exciting game, but it is certainly a worthwhile suggestion if you're wanting a game that can play 6 people because it fits the bill fine for that.
The main reason keeping this game from being rated higher IMO is how inevitably everyone will be just drawing cards from the top of the deck (because there is no options in the display) so there is a high luck element. The good thing though is that the game moves VERY quickly, even with 6 players (because it is either "draw a card" or "play a set & discard the rest" on your turn).
The different cards add a nice variability for replays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I don't think this is the title I would have chosen for this?
But I liked this game.  Players try to create sets of cards, but are limited by the strict hand limit.  However, the cards are different fantasy peoples who have different powers that affect the game in various ways (and there are lots of different decks, which probably helps replayability).  There's a board with some area control on it too, but it's really the card play that makes the game interesting.
The rhythm of the game is unusual and imperfect.  Players can take cards to their hands or play cards from their hands, so at some times during the game, it's mainly just drawing cards and trying to build up your hand. However, there's also some incentive to get your sets out early, and I think that works out well. (1 play)

I'm not a massive fan of area-control games in general, but this was a particularly bad example. Can't put my finger on it exactly but the game simply had no drama to it, I really disliked it that the players never lose influence in the areas, players simply race to cram their cubes in ever-increasing piles onto the map.

For a CMON game, the production value is disappointing. 

The graphic color choices are fine for all but the colorblind, but the background texture used should have been varied for each color. The logos for each race are rendered indistinguishable at a distance due to the triangle framing of each icon. The illustrations are technically proficient, but the printing is washed out and lacking in contrast, making most tribes look similar in tone, again, minimizing their distinctiveness.

A better Ticket to Ride. You can actually INTERACT with your opponents by contesting the areas they control, and the cards you pick can be used in multiple ways, making for more interesting decisions on each turn.

Despite the boring presentation for a CMON game (shock horror!), this game adds a new spin to the area control genre. The difficulty of adding more pieces to an area as you grow stronger and stronger is interesting and definitely new. The variable powers of each race also adds a lot of variety to the game. Despite being so different in terms of racial abilities, the 12 races are quite balanced. Every race felt overpowered which in itself balances each other out. High recommended.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (January 2018)

I have disliked every Cool Mini or Not game I have played (with the possible exception of Xenoshyft, the jury is still out on that one) so I wasn’t expecting much from Ethnos. The reason I bought it was the designer, Paolo Mori, which I respect a lot. Every game I have played from him has had some interesting feature and Ethnos is no exception.

The rules of the game are easy to grasp and teach, you can teach them under 6 minutes. Playtime is, surprisingly, fast. Even with 6 players, there is almost no downtime.

One thing I have come to expect from CMON is the high quality of their games, but here, they dropped the ball. The board is way too small and ugly. The art of the cards is functional, but nothing special. The player´s pieces are merely ok, but they are unstable. I’m very surprised by this.

The theme is really cool, but sadly, it is pasted on. You really don’t feel it in the game.

Gameplay is very fun. At first I was very engaged with the game. You will play for 3 rounds and at the beginning here are many cards to choose from but after a couple of turns you will have to draw from the deck and luck will decide which card you will get (this bothers me a lot and it is the deal breaker for me). The decisions needed to play the game aren’t very hard making Ethnos a family level game. Either you play your hand or you draw another card. When you play your hand you will discard the cards that you didn’t play. This is a neat feature.

There are 12 races in the game and you will only use 6 in each game, each race has a different power. I love this feature in games. The relationship between the races will be different most times and it is easily expandable. It also makes the game highly repayable.

The luck factor is high. When you lose a position, there is no way to attack again if the cards don’t help. When you have options of which card to draw the game is great, but when you have to blindly draw from the deck (as most times) the game is boring.

Another issue is that the first players have a definitive advantage as the round ends immediately. This means the first players will have (more likely) more turns than everybody else. I didn’t see any way to mitigate this and I feel it is very unfair.

When you attack a player, it doesn’t really feels like an attack, that is, you don’t feel the game is mean and that’s weird in an area control game. I prefer games to be this way.

Bottom line, Ethnos is among the best CMON games I have played, but the luck factor is too much for me. I already sold my copy of the game. I would play again if requested as I kind of liked it. I´m very glad the game moves at a fast pace so the 2 big issue I have with the game can be (barely) forgotten. Perhaps with 2 players the luck factor would be reduced. The graphic design leaves a lot to be desired and that’s very weird coming from CMON. It can be a good family game or it can serve as an introductory game for new gamers. It is mostly a tactical endeavor.

One play only, but very promising. Simple mechanics are easy to explain and understand, but the decision making has the right degree of challenge for the game weight and length.

Multiplayer works well as the turns are short. the game has a cyclical tempo, with a number of turns just around drawing before sets are played and the draw pool fills up with cards.

Rivals Arboretum for the best use of a discard mechanism in a game.

Solid, light gateway using set collection (Ticket to Ride) as the mechanism for placing area majority. The various creatures provide fun additions to these collection aspect yielding higher replayability. Turns are simple - draw a card OR pay a set.

Ethnos is an interesting blend of set collection and area control, both of which are viable scoring avenues in the game. The theme of this game could really be anything (medieval lords, sci-fi, etc.), but the game itself is satisfying enough that you can overlook how thinly implemented the theme is. The various mix of factions and abilities makes for immense replayability. The brief play time and simple rules make this a no-brainer for me.

Ethnos is a simple area control/set collection game.  It had potential.  I enjoyed my first play or two.   What kills the game for me is that you are often relegated to drawing blind in a set collection game.  That  is a poor design choice.   There needs to be an automatic reset of the open cards at some point.  Too many gateway games that are much better.

Not really loving this one. There's a lot of top decking and some of the races just seem straight up better to me, so I haven't always enjoyed how it feels to play. "Ticket to Rage," sure, but I'd rather play Ticket to Ride or Blood Rage.

RATING: 7
How can a new game look so old-fashioned in 2017? Every average Kickstarter game looks far better than this release. The gory illustrations by John Howe are a huge mismatch to the drab gameboard and the otherwise functional graphics. 

Once beyond these stumbling blocks, Ethnos is a solid eurogame; a smooth mix of set collection, push-your-luck and area majority. Players try to collect sets in rummy-style. The trick is that they are allowed to collect a maximum of ten cards before having to play a set and then discarding the rest of their hand to the center display. This display is quickly emptied and not refilled from the draw stack. Thus, drawing blind and hoping for a matching card is a big part of the game. Gamble high unsuccessfully and the game can be lost early on.

With the played set, players can place one army to the board with each consecutive army in the same area being more expensive. The leader of the set played grants a special effect depending on his suit. Only six of the twelve suits are in each single game ensuring variance between plays. A good game for a higher player count if played reasonably quickly.

Ethnos is quick playing and peaceful old school-ish Euro area majority game. It combines TtR-style card drafting during three rounds that you don't know of when they are going to end. It is a mix of known mechanisms combined with uninspired, generic fantasy art. Beginning of the game is very random and you can't plan much early on. Towards the end there is some tension and less randomness, but three rounds also signals a lot of rinse and repeat. It offers me feelings reminiscent of Alhambra and TtR, but both of those are more exciting as Ethnos falls short on both competition and doing your own stuff.

RATING: 8.5
The game's uber-simple structure leads to frenetic pacing, but the leader powers lead to a good level of strategy. Also, with 12 races, only 6 of which are used every game (and this reeks of potential expensions), the replayability is through the roof. Can't wait to play again.

Ethnos is pretty much a Ticket to Ride area control game with a single twist that makes the game good: when you use your cards, you discard all the rest. This creates a push your luck element that transforms a somewhat boring mechanism into a tense and interesting one.

Ethnos is a really smart game. It is mechanically as simple as Ticket to Ride — its core is set collection. Yet there are enough decisions that it could almost qualify as a mid-weight game. Add plenty of player interaction that never feels mean and this becomes a fun and memorable gaming experience.

Tienes que asociar cartas del mismo color o de la misma raza para poner tus marcadores en un terreno concreto. Hay que intentar tener más marcadores que los demás para controlar ese terreno y llevarte más puntos de victoria. Además, cada raza tiene una habilidad especial.

Un buen juego, con una duración ni larga ni corta, con un buen rango de jugadores (2-6), con buenos materiales. He estado dudando entre ponerle un 7 o un 8, me he decidido por el 7 porque creo que le falta un poquito más para ganárselo.

OK game. Very light and didn't feel too engaging. Quick and fun enough tho'. 

Don't know how much life it will have after you've seen the different characters. Feels strangely old-fashioned with the little board and basic rules (not that that is necessarily a bad thing - I like good, simple, clean designs) - if this had come out 5 - 10 years earlier it would have stood out a lot more. As it is it's 'OK' but not thrilling....

Mishmash art, mishmash mechanics. I think there's something good here. I think the art is fine and the theme is fine. What I don't like is some of the factions seem so much better and the value of controlling regions seems completely besides the point. A 2.0 version of this could be awesome though.

Bought and played @ International TableTop day at my FLGS.    Played well with 3, 4, and 6.  Cards are a little flimsy for a heavy card holding and shuffling game.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Thought this to be a solid midweight euro in which each game will potentially look different as different races/abilities are in play. This one is cleverly put together and plays quickly. My only frustration is how much you draw card unseen and fate unseen in this one and wish there was a visible tableau most of the game. When you do play a set, you do discard all cards you do not use in the set to the tableau. Ripe for expansions.

Sammle gleichfarbige Karten oder Sets von gleichen Karten, spiele diese in Deiner Runde aus. Die Karte, die zuoberst liegt, gibt vor, in welchem Gebiet Du einen Einflussmarker setzen darfst und welche Spezialfähigkeit man nutzt.

Wenn aus dem Nachziehstapel drei Drachen gezogen wurden, ist das Spiel vorbei.

A pleasant throwback to earlier Euros which is simple and pure in its design. The variety of races act as card suits with inherent abilities and keep game plays fresh and interesting. My only complaint is the tendency for the draw action to deteriorate into a boring exercise in top-decking when the available card pool nears depletion waiting for cards to be added. Perhaps this could be resolved by allowing for a minimum pool size as in Ticket to Ride or allowing for two cards to be drawn off the top deck with one discarded to the pool. (Credit to Thurot for noticing the Gangs of Slovakios.)

You gather different types of races that are in different colors.  When you gather cards of the same color or the same card type, you can play them down.  You can play one card or many cards, but when you play all remaining cards are discarded.  You can only hold 10 cards.  Each race a different ability.  You are trying to gain control of different territories. And you score after the third dragon shows up in the course. 

The game was ok.  It was light and it had some decisions but often you find yourself drawing blind for a card, hoping for the card you need before the round ends.  It is too light and a bit of miss for me.

Traded away July 2017 for Captain Sonar

Solid if a little dry. My group tends to like player interaction, even if it is just trash talk. For some reason, we were quite silent while playing this game. We like that the turns are very quick. But it seems that the deliberation about what/how to play doesn't require players to speak to each other. Likely because this game is simply about setting up majorities without direct conflict. Still, a decent game and very easy to pick up. Would make a decent gateway game. As far as the art....old school fantasy roleplaying feeling. The game name....kinda lame....but at it's heart the game is pretty good. Time will tell if it's a keeper.
Further plays confirm that this game is really dry. Wanted to love it, but I really can't.

playing warbands from your hand using colours or fantasy races - using 6 races out of 12 which gives a lot of variety - played 3 times and came last twice and 2nd from last once. this hasn't put me off as its a great game.

Ethnos was way better than I was expecting it to be.  I think part of the appeal is each tribe has a special ability.  You're not just doing basic color set collection, but you're also trying to get abilities that will give you an advantage one way or another.  Super fast gameplay that can handle a lot of players.  Looks to be a keeper.

Originally picked up Royals as a light area majority game for my collection.  Similar to Ethnos since you're using set collections to claim "Royals".  However, Ethnos is way more exciting to play.  I know Ethnos gets picked on for it's art, but it also is much easier to parse visually than Royals - now that's an ugly game and makes it a bit harder to play than it should!  Royals will be leaving my collection and I don't see Ethnos budging.  Should get fairly regular play.

RATING: 8
Excellent gateway+ game. The combination of set collection and area control flows together perfectly and the result is a super fast playing game with lots of difficult decisions. The end of age push-your-luck aspect adds tension as well, making the call to play what you have or wait for something better excruciating.

Good: 
Very little downtime so turns go quickly. 

Good amount of strategy. 

Because random cards are selected at during setup as well as points for each section of the island different strategies are used each time you play keeping the game feeling fresh. 

The quick turn order and diversity in cards makes you want to immediately play again.

I like the artwork used on the cards. 


Bad: 
Card quality is very lackluster, they are extremely thin and feel flimsy. 

The art used for the board is very generic and drab. I would have preferred something more vibrant and varied.

The markers are oddly colored, I am not sure if this is so it's color blind friendly but the colors selected are pretty ugly.  

Even though there are a decent number of races in the core box I would have liked to see even more (that don't require extra boards) for additional variety. 

They labeled a goblin an orc... a scrawny green critter as an orc? Someone failed their lore roll when putting the cards together.

I've waffled on this game a lot. The base mechanisms are pretty simple but the racial differences are great, blending into hundreds of different combinations, each with its own strategic requirement. Unfortunately the game can devolve into a top deck battle which isn't fun at all, but I am hoping that is the result of bad groupthink. When players play bands at the "right" rhythm to keep the draft pool at least somewhat full, it moves fast and feels good.

RATING: 8
I like this game, but a few things keep me from being as enamored with it as I normally would be. For one thing, the theme is almost nonexistent. You're playing these fantasy races in sets to control areas of the board, but the theme could have almost been anything. Also, the little discs that you use to show control are one of my least favorite components ever. They're difficult to store properly in the insert, and they're so difficult to stack that they constantly fall apart when I handle them. Lastly, I feel like the round end scoring is a little awkward at times. In each area of the board, ties are very likely to happen, and so most of your points actually come from the sets you've made. It's fine, I guess, but a little strange in execution.

Those things aside, I did find myself enjoying Ethnos. It's a bit of a slog for an area control game that should be this simple, as you're only drawing one card every turn. It's also a little awkward that the card offer doesn't replenish unless someone has cards left in their hand after playing a set. It really made me long for the Ticket to Ride style of replenishing the offer and having the choice of drawing two cards every turn. Having to blindly draw one card from turn to turn can be really annoying.

I'm really coming off as nit-picky on Ethnos, but I don't really mean to. It was just a bit of a slow burn for me, and I imagine it will get better with repeated plays. This really does feel like the best gateway to area control out there, even if the fantasy theme may be a little off-putting for some. The area control actually isn't as interesting as the card play and their abilities, which range from really cool to just being extra ways of scoring points.

It all feels very dry and Euro-y, which is typical of Paulo Mori's games, but it is nonetheless fun. This is probably my favorite game of his along with Libertalia and Augustus, but all of them are prone to runaway leaders, which is a pretty major drawback for me. So time will tell if this game rises or falls for me, but I do think it has potential despite its rough edges.

No sense, You have just to draw from the table the best cards you can get, then draw from the deck and hope you have luck. Full stop. Boring, not even a game for the most of the time.

Played this game 4 times as soon as I purchased it. It plays supurbly at 2 players. Each game feels different because it offer so much variability in only playing 5 of the 12 tribes (in a two player game). This game is so much fun. Yeah, theme is pasted on but still an amazing game. I can't wait to play it with more players!

Fantastic game...

...with ZERO table presence.  Utterly generic board and poor graphic design.  Completely forgettable name.  I can handle the high-fantasy theme (the John Howe art is nice) but overall it's an uninspired package and feels like CMON didn't realize what they had on their hands... 

It's a real shame as it feels like in the hands of a Days or Wonder or a Space Cowboys that this could have been a modern classic with lasting broader appeal along the lines of a Ticket to Ride or Splendor.

Not the most attractive of games, the components are fairly bland and the "theme" is the old tried and tested fantasy races (orcs, goblins, halflings, etc).

The game plays quick, your turn has 2 actions and you're done. You almost don't have time to think and there is a feeling that the other players breathe a sigh of relief when someone takes a little longer to make a turn so they have time to think.

Simple area control game, that plays better and quicker than El Grande.

What an amazing game.  Gameplay elements are stripped away to reveal a finely honed machine of game design.  It combines Ticket to Ride style set collection, Blood Rage Area control, and variable race powers like Small World, which swap-out with every game.  A lot of strategy, and I believe that the only luck comes from the allies draw deck.  The components and artwork are beautiful, and the theme is unique in that anyone playing can ignore it and focus on the mechanics, and yet anyone can easily step back and see how the theme makes sense ot what you are doing in the game.  Dirt simple to learn, really fast gameplay, scales beautifully, and has lots of room for mastery.

I find that when I encounter a game that I can describe as "It's like ______, but with ______" I usually wind up preferring the original to the remix, unless there is some aspect of the original that has been significantly improved. Ethnos is a rare case where I can't decide which is better, it or the similar, Ticket To Ride.

So yes, Ethnos is just TTR, but with Area Control instead of Route Building. The thing that stands out in Ethnos is, when you play a set you are forced to discard all the other cards you have to the table, where they are available for other players to snatch up. Combined with each suit having its own powers, this makes for more strategic play than TTR without significantly increasing play time.

For those who find TTR too simplistic, Ethnos might be something to try.

P.S. Ethnos looks like it was trying to get a Tolkein license and failed. The art, graphic design of the board, even the font looks cribbed from War Of The Ring.

A great area majority game. The card types have different abilities and changing up the card types gives lots of replay ability. The rules are very simple to learn and teach.

I was hearing a lot about this one, but once I finally played it, I'm not sure it lived up to the hype. I enjoyed it fine, but the whole drawing of cards over and over again can be slightly tedious. Seems to have plenty of variety though with the 12 races and I'd play it again.

RATING: 8
Enjoying this one. Area control is always a favorite of mine and this has an interesting collecting card sets-Ticket to Ride feeling but then the special power make this really interesting. 
My enjoyment might depend a bit on race combinations though, I don't mind phases of random card draws for a bit, but having elves and centaurs together in our most recent game gave us way too much of that due to the display never really filling up again, so I might try to stay away from that combination. Otherwise I do like the variety of different combinations though and the feel of the game does indeed change based on what is in play, while still maintaining its overall ease of play. See this going into regular rotation for quiet a while even with Essen coming up. :D

Now let's see if I can find those german fairies anywhere.

If Ticket to Ride had an affair with Small World, and their love-child came out looking like Sloth from "The Goonies", it would be this game.

It's area-control by way of a two-pronged set-collecting mechanism that punishes you if hoarding cards for too long. Add to that the special abilities of the races, with a soft trigger for end-of-round scoring, and you have a winner of a game with an awesome ease of entry game play that attracts newbies and gamers alike.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (2):[/COLOR]

[i]I'll just cut to the chase, I haven't disliked a game this much in a long time. I was really looking forward to playing Ethnos; I love area control and the idea of combining it with a set collection mechanic sounded fun. It wasn't... at all. The game is almost completely driven by luck. Each age, of which there are 3, "x" number of cards laid out depending on player count. That row never refills until a player plays a set and then has to discard their remaining cards to the display, this leads to countless turns of drawing blindly from the top of the deck. Because of this, it becomes difficult trying to plan at all; as the game goes on you can't count on getting a card you can use. 

For me Ethnos fails as an area control game; the best part of an area control game is the constant jockeying for position with other players by moving your pieces around. Not only can't you do that in Ethnos, due to the random card draw it was almost impossible to plan when you'd be able to add another token to a specific region.

Ethnos is a frustrating game to play and wastes unbelievable potential. The different race abilities are interesting, although some are clearly better than others; the lack of control takes away from your ability to execute any king of strategy. I will not be playing Ethnos again and I'd caution anyone who gets caught up in the hype of certain reviewers. Marco Arnaudo summarizes the problems with this game in his [geekurl=/video/128034/ethnos/video-review]review[/geekurl]. If you are looking for a family weight, area control game that also uses set collection I would highly recommend [thing=165986]Royals[/thing].[/i]

A fairly simple area control/set collecting game. I like there are 3 ages to play through (Two with 2 or 3 players), scoring happens at the end of each age and your control markers stay on the board. There is a decent amount variety as you randomly select the armies that will be used each game (by flipping over 6 army selection cards) and each army has a special ability, 4 or 5 of them have small extra boards for even more scoring. One of the mechanics is one you place a band of allies (matching set of cards) you must discard the rest of your hand face-up on the table for other players to draw from, unless your leader of the band has a special ability to prevent that (Elves let you keep X number of cards and Centaurs let you place a second band of allies).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I really like the idea of the dragons that suddenly ends the game.  You have to be aware of them. Another nice thing is that you can't collect a lot of good cards for later use,  since you sometimes have to clear your hand after you have played a band of allies. (Depends on the setup for the game.) Also very good rules for 2 players.  There are 924 different setups for the game,  which means that you have to play with sligthly different tactic every game.  I can really recommend this game.

This thing is a few things blended together in a very neat and fun package. This game is 1. Very fast 2. Very simple 3. Very fun. I could play this game about 5 times in a row and not get bored of it. The turns are lightning fast which I think is one of it's most endearing qualities. You will not be bored because it will be back around to your turn again before you know it. There is a lot more game here than you would think as well. A massive amount of possible race combinations makes for an endlessly entertaining and engaging game. One of my current favorites.

RATING: 6.5
2 plays - This game did seem over-hyped. It didn't help that the first time I played, I was presented with very few good options for almost the entirety of the game. The 2nd time I had a better run, but watched others suffer the same fate. There is a lot more luck in the card draws than I had first anticipated.

With that aside, the different faction abilities were all very unique and interesting, ranging from additional card draws (wizard), becoming the leader of the giants or progressing yourself on a track (merfolk thingys). I really enjoyed using the abilities and deciding which character powers to 'lead' a card set. The area control aspect is also a very well-conceived idea. As an area becomes more populated with control markers, it simultaneously takes you bigger (and therefore more challenging) card sets to advance. This coupled with the varying point tokens makes for a very well engineered and balanced area control game, where high point tokens are more greatly contested. 

The artwork is obviously lacking but really, don't get to caught up on that. Many German style euro games are equally as boring, if not more drab, but are still widely loved. I think this point is definitely over-made and for a game that's simple and quick, you'll not even notice it once you get past setup.

Overall, I feel this game could have become one of the 'very greats', but unfortunately is tarred by its over-reliance on luck, which ultimately takes a lot of 'player agency' away. As it is, I'd still have fun playing this from time to time with a crowd who were just looking for some laughs and not something too strategic.

Ethnos is a set-collection area-majority game set in a fantasy universe. Each game will use six of the 12 possible races; cards from those races are shuffled into a large deck. Players must then collect and play cards either all of the same race or all of the same color to place a token in a region--the number of cards in the set must exceed the number of tokens you already have in that region. The card on top of the played set determines the color of the region you place in, and its race determines the special ability you get when you play the set. At the end of each of the three rounds, players score majorities for regions, as well as triangular points for the size of their sets. This game was very easy to learn and play. However, as a card game it had a significant random factor, and lacked some of the strategic depth I would like.

Solid design, definite keeper; good gateway/next step. The overly battle-y front cover and bland board are really the only downsides to this game which, at its heart, is one of area control by way of set collection. The geography of the board is not used at all (in the base game, I'm hoping an expansion will give it some purpose) but everything gels together very nicely indeed. The game can absolutely fly - even at six players - when everyone is drawing cards, so allowing time for the band-making decision is then fair enough. The different races allow for good variability, although if teaching to new players, I'd suggest using the 'obvious' powers (Wizard, Dwarf, Halfling, Giant for starters) before kicking in with the funkier ones.

This is an area majorities flip luck heavy game that genuinely manages to be compelling, which is an unusual thing for me to encounter. The idea is this; the central board has different regions that do a majority scoring each round. On your turn you draw one card from either the faceup display or the top of the facedown deck, or you play one or more cards that either all have the same color, or have the same fantasy race, and then you discard the rest of your unplayed hand to the display for other players to pick over. If the cards you played were greater than the number of tokens you have in the region of matching color, you get to add one new token. You also get to use the special power of the top card in the set played, and this is where the game gets really interesting. Despite how luck of the draw it is, you actually wind up with interesting puzzles in your hand as you have to choose what you want to go for, faction ability, color, and which province you are aiming for. Then you also have an aspect of pushing your luck, knowing that each time you blind draw to improve your set, you're running the risk of improving other player's draws. 

The rounds can end suddenly, as three dragon cards get seeded in the bottom half of the deck. This can often create some frustration as players might have been lining up a great move right before the round suddenly ends, and they're forced to discard their hands. It's an interesting tension, that I perhaps would like a lot less in a longer game, but in this format it seems fine.

The faction powers are all really interesting, and they interact with each other in compelling ways depending on the setup, as you don't see every power every game. Another compelling aspect of this game is that there's also the option to ignore the board state, and focus on getting larger sets of cards, which can score big points at the end of the round.

I don't see this game becoming a favorite, but it's a really nice light ride.

Friends will be shocked to hear that I enjoyed a game with orcs in it! But beneath the lazy pasted-on fantasy setting is a stripped-down old-school Euro with a dash of modern variable setup and special powers.

There are a number of similarities to Ticket to Ride: each turn is a simple choice to draw a card from a display or play a matching set of cards; playing a set allows you to play markers on the board which may score later, but you also score directly for the size of sets you play. But instead of route-building, the board-play is pure area majority, and to add a counter to a region, the set of cards you play must be larger than the number of counters you already have there.

So far so simple, and the turns move pleasantly briskly (in fact the biggest problem was players not realising it was their turn again already!). But there are a couple of twists. At the beginning of the game, 6 races (this is where the bloody orcs come in) are randomly chosen from 12. When you play a set of cards, you also choose one of them to be the leader and get to execute the special power of the associated race. Some give extra scoring opportunities; some get round the restrictions on adding counters to the board; and some help you mitigate the other big twist...

Unlike Ticket to Ride, there's a hand limit and when you play a set, you have to discard the rest of your hand into the face-up display for the other players to pick over - in fact, this is the only way the display gets replenished. This helps with the briskness because you can only really focus on one objective at a time, but it also generates the biggest complaint about the game. Often the display will be empty and the players are reduced to drawing blind, hoping to add to a set. 

Opinions on the game in our group were divided and I suspect this was correlated to the amount of luck in drawing the right cards from the deck. Time will tell if it was due only to my good fortune, but it was a good first impression for me.

A set collection/area control game, with a fantasy theme. On your turn you draft a card into your hand, or play a band from your hand. A band must be either the same color with different races or different colors of the same race. One card is chosen as a leader which determines the location of the board to place a control marker, a twist is that the band must be larger than the number of control tokens already on the board for the player. Also the the race gives you a special ability, to twist the rules. The remaining cards must be discarded to the table and are now available for draft.

The size of the bands determine the number of points scored. Being in lead for the regions determines control for scoring the regions. Some of the races have some specialized scoring for that race.

Easy to learn, fast paced, mechanics are clean and understandable. Some variety is provide that only 6 of the 12 races are used during the game. All in all a nice little game.

First impression: after one two player learning game, we really liked it. Once the Dragons start coming out, the push-your-luck tension gets palpable. The map seems completely superfluous; could just as easily have been 6 colored cards or 6 tracks. Hoping they add expansions in the future which take adjacency of regions into account.

About midway through the first round, I was like, "meh". I don't really like set collection games that much. However, as I started to catch on to the special abilities and the growing challenge of the area control I all but fell in love with this one. The only reason I give it a 7.5 is because I've only played this one once and I could see myself cooling on this one a bit. The board looks terrible, but not as bad as it did on the youtube videos, and I actually kind of like the art on the cards. This is a quick game with a lot of meaningful decisions to be made. If I get a couple of more plays of this one and am still loving it, it could definitely be one that I would add to my collection to feel that quick set collection itch. My only other set collection game at this point is Castles of Burgundy the Card Game, so I definitely have room for another set collection game on the shelf.

Mechanically and thematically, could be a gateway game. Play is simple enough--it's easy enough to teach--but it seems a little more complex than a gateway game should be. Perhaps it's because understanding the powers of the races (which vary from game to game) is integral to success. Such knowledge only comes with repeated play, and that seems counter to what a gateway game should be.

Another roadblock to gateway status: the unfortunate theme and artwork. Doesn't match the easy nature of the game system.

Hype definitely did not match the actual game. While I like the different races of the game, I'm not too particularly fond of the actual card play in the game. You spend a few rounds building up a hand, play it and then have to start all over. Building up a hand is slow, boring and random. If no cards are available from the face up supply, you have to draw a card and hope it matches what you need.

This game was ok...completely over hyped.  First, components and presentation count (for me).  Nothing about the physical aspect of this game was appealing.  The art was bad, the components sucked - the cards were thin, the plastic pieces were cheap...this game was just soooo uninviting.

Let me say that we were taught this game by Mike Fitzgerald and it was a joy to play with him (he's so nice!).  After, both my wife and I commented to each other that playing with him was great and the game was perfectly "meh".

It's just Ticket-to-Smallworld, and the "new" mechanic of discarding your remaining hand when you play cards that other players can pick up is not fun.

Not a bad game but I just cannot wrap my head around a strategy on how to play. Plus I find that there is a lot of luck in the game. If you do not draw the cards that you need or they are not on the table in front of you then it is hard to get your sets.

A fun, fast game. This game is very dull by appearance. I'm so glad I got to play it though. A simple game of area control and set collection that plays quickly. There's a decent bit of randomness with the card draws without much that can be done to mitigate it. However, since the game is so short it doesn't feel like you are spending hours playing a game that you have no control over. I'd happily play this one again if someone requested it, but I'll likely not seek it out for my personal collection.

(+) Novel mix of area majority, set collection, and push-your-luck elements is fresh. Multiple races contribute to the variety found in each play.
(+) Simple, straightforward ruleset.
(+) Able to accommodate high player counts without losing a beat in the pace of the gameplay.

(-) Far too luck driven--turns almost always devolve into players fishing for a card that can salvage their hand from the deck.
(-) Decisions are not very meaningful. Often, the action you take on your turn is quite obvious.
(-) For an area majority game, it lacks tension through conflict. This is unsual, to say the least.

RATING: 6
Trolls are terrible for the game.  Tie breaks are just too good, and getting the most troll tokens is just too random.

My first game also included (at random) several cards that have weak powers and thus further add luck to the draw (hobbits, giants).  Looking at the omitted cards, I think the game would be better on a repeat with a different mix.  Many of the other sets reward larger hands, add tactical tradeoffs, and reduce variance overall.

But separate from that, the game can get a bit slow -- individual turns are generally fast, but you get so little done each turn that the overhead of passing the turn adds up.  Also, one slow player (Even if they are justifiable managing a large hand with a lot of centaurs or elves) slows down every one of those micro-plays.  If everyone keeps up the pace, it's not too bad but still can suffer.

RATING: 6
the game is just muddy to me. maybe lower player counts would be different, but with ~6 players it's such a chaotic, muddy mess that it's almost not worth your time to figure out the race powers and rather just do what you can to stay afloat with the best tactical play as it comes around to you. the area control shifts so greatly at times, like walking through mud, you can't bank on any advantage. on top of that, the card graphic design just kinda blends muddily together. my friends love this game and on paper it SEEMS like i should too. i don't, though. and, as much as they say they love it, i haven't seen it recently hit any of the tables at the meetups.

Area control mixed with set collection and it works well. We played with a wrong rule where we thought we could put our chip anywhere as opposed to the region represented by the leader's card, but I still enjoyed it even then, so I can imagine I'd like it even more with the added thinkiness that provides. Has a very uncommon mechanic where once you place a set you have to put all the other cards into the middle of the table for others to get, so collecting a bunch of cards could end up being a waste of precious turns and a lot more agonizing. Also like how it plays up to six players with no scaling issues that I could tell.

Wish the game had a more unique theme instead of dreary-looking generic fantasy, though. I'd probably get this to the table all the time if it had a more interesting and family friendly theme. Box art doesn't help the game look interesting either.

Pros:

-It plays up to six players.
-It is easy to teach, yet still offers at least a bit of thinking to not absolutely bore actual gamers.
-12 races (out of which you only use a random 6 per game) offer quite some variety

Cons:

-Absolutely no flair or the like, random theme. This might as well be a 100% abstract game.
-Even for a gateway game, a bit shallow. Just a few more options would have improved it significantly I think.

It's okay, I think a lot of people will like this but doesn't set the world alight, set collection with area control and push your luck all nicely combined, only minor gripe is that perhaps the strategy might be a bit solvable and then it's all a matter of hitting the right cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This moves at a very quick pace, but part of that is down to the lack of choices you have. If you have no cards you need to pick one up. If you need two or three cards to add to an area then you need to pick up another card. Along the way are decisions like whether you want to jump into an area cheaply or hopefully keep drawing that race or colour to hopefully add to an area you're already in. At the end of the day the choices are rather limited and the game is almost playing you. Almost. With a simple take a card from the top of the deck mechanism you draw what you draw and there's not much you can do about it. What separates the scores however should for the most part come down to the little decisions and the little risks you take. Some of that comes down to card counting. Some of it comes down to evaluating whether the reward is worth it. They're the decisions.

I think this one is rather decent for two main reasons: Firstly it's quick. The turns are quick and the game is quick. Little things might cost you a bunch of points, but it's all good because you haven't invested a whole evening into the game. You take your lumps and enjoy the ride. Secondly there are twelve different races to choose five or six from each game. That spices up games and gives you something to explore. (It needs it, because otherwise it'd get old quickly.) The points available in the areas will change from game to game, but playing, for instance, with or without Wizards is going to make for a different experience. Each race has it's own little or big quirk that mixes up the rules in a small and yet not insignificant way. Nice.

The game plays great with six players and is easy to teach. Worthwhile for any collection if you need something light and an hour long that plays with five or six. The fantasy theme is the usual fluff, but it needs a theme, so it might as well be goblins, trolls, orcs, giants...

I have a special place in my heart for easy playing light-medium Euros.  Games with a small selection of actions available on your turn, interesting decisions to be made, quality components, 30-45 minutes in length, quick turns, engaging gameplay... Games like Abyss, Splendor, World's Fair 1893 - Ethnos sits along side those quite nicely.  A fantastic game.  I really hope CMON supports this one with more races some day, but there is plenty of fun in the box to hold me for a while!

Honestly, I can't believe the overwhelming hype for this game.  For me, it was the ultimate epitome of a meh-fest.  I'm probably rating it more harshly than I should as it wasn't long and wasn't terrible, but man...where is the game.  It's area control, which I normally detest, but it doesn't feel like you're in control of anything.  You're top-decking cards most of the game, which makes for a total random mess in your hand.  One of our players was literally just collecting every card he didn't need.  The production quality is also dicey.  The map is ok, but it might as well be 6 islands since adjacency means nothing.  The control markers are terrible.  The insert is trying to be this perfect means to hold everything and it fails.  The primary good thing is that the pain ends relatively quickly.

RATING: 7
A surprisingly decent game which is one part hand management, and another part area control. Players form melds of factions in their hands to lay down influence on the board, and each faction comes with a special ability too. These special abilities could boost your chances at area majorities, meld scoring or even set up a subgame for VP.

The key to enjoying Ethnos is to accept that you will be drawing mystery meat from the deck for most of the game. Yes, you are reliant on luck of the draw, but that doesn't mean that the decisions you make don't matter either. There still is tension in deciding which meld you'd want to gun for and which scoring avenue to prioritise. If there is one thing I dislike about Ethnos, it's that the grim artwork is a mismatch. It sets up expectations for a brooding, conflict-ridden game when the reality is that the game is much closer to say, Ticket to Ride in nature. The garish player discs don't help the overall presentation either.

I love the simplicity. Each turn, take a card or play a set of cards. Dull art design sadly, but I can live with that. The gameplay isn't deep but there are real choices (do I go for big sets or grab some territory?) and a lot of variety (12 different races of which only use 5 or 6, depending on player count, each game.) Other players also matter. If you're smart you're watching what cards they're taking and of course it matters what provinces they're trying to grab.

I am surprised that I do not like this game.  I did not feel like I had much control over the card play.  I seemed lacking real strategy.  Maybe it was just a weird assortment of races.  Even though I am a fan of John Howe, I did not find the art very well done either.  I am up for giving it another try, though.

Similar to "Ticket to Ride" in both mechanisms and weight and quite possibly a better game. Instead of playing the board as "Ticket to Ride" does, where the board determines the routes and cards needed to claim them, "Ethnos" has you playing yourself. To lay claim to a territory you need to accumulate more cards than the influence you already have in that territory. 

In a great twist, all cards in a players hand not played as a band are added to the pool for other players to take! 

Each clan having a unique "leader" ability adds a lot of variety and strategic opportunity.

What a cool, quick, streamlined area-majorities / card drafting / set collection kinda game! The rules are quite simple but game play is still interesting. The powers vary widely (meld another set before discarding, hold onto some cards, place in any region, count as a bigger set, etc.) and with so many races in the box (and surely more coming soon?), you'll play a different combination every time!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Players start with a hand of cards, each of which belongs to one of the races and has one of 6 colors (corresponding to the 6 regions of the board). There's also a random display of 5(?) cards at the start. On your turn, you either draw a card or play card(s).
- Draw = take a card from Display or deck, add it to your hand. If you draw a Dragon (3 were shuffled into bottom half of deck), discard it and replace unless it was the 3rd Dragon = end of Era (immediately)
- Play = meld a set of cards, either all the same color or all the same race, with one card on top. The top card's power activates. Then, if the size of the set exceeds the number of your tokens in the top card's board region (matching color), you may place another token there. Then, add the rest of your hand to the Display!

When the Era ends, score each region (chits worth 0-10 VP were randomly distributed during setup; values increase with each Era) according to area majority: award VP for 1st place in Era 1, 1st/2nd in Era 2, 1st/2nd/3rd in Era 3. Also earn VP for your sets of 2+ cards. Then shuffle all the cards and repeat. After 3 Eras, most VP wins!

RATING: 6.5
Interesting combination of area control and set collection.  Unfortunately, it is a game that wouldn't request to play. A good portion of the game felt like you were just subject to results of the draw off of the top of the deck or what other players left you :( This makes the set collecting rather difficult with several bad draws. Also the game has rather dull graphic design.

Right off the bat though I have to say that this game has the second worst card quality in my collection. As this is a card game I assume they will last through MAYBE ten plays. Thanks to an Amazon Prime Day glitch I didn't pay anywhere near full price for this game. 

The artwork, graphic design, and the rest of the component quality is abysmal as well.

RATING: 6.5
Clever area majority game where players place tokens by playing a set of cards of the same fantasy race or the same colour (in which case they count as the race of the top card). Regions are colour coded and you can only play there if the top card matches; each of the races has a special power, like "play anywhere" or "counts as plus one strength".

I like this a lot, though the production is ugly and compares very unfavourably to the similar-concept Small World. My real issue is the card draw mechanism, which seems to end up with players just drawing random cards off the top of the deck a lot. (When a player puts out a set, all excess cards are made available and public, but the tempo doesn't seem to work quite right.)

A very good game that should have been a great game.

Excellent first impression.  I like the intricacy of the cardplay.  I hope the suits as yet unplayed don't send its balance or simplicity all akimbo.

RATING: 7.5
Good, quick playing game with a lot of depth and replayability.A set-collection game with an area control component. The map suggest a heavier empasis on the area control as it basically has, as point scoring is a little tilted towards the sets. But both areas require a decent presence to actually grab a win. Add in bonus conditions as a side-track giving extra free board presence plus a minor account of VPs, and a side board giving an extra set to complete over the course of the game and the result is a game with a lot of choices.The variable setup adds replayability, as only a subset of card powers will be present each game. Deciding what set to collect, when to cash in on any given set in hand (forcing you to discard any excess towards a publicly available pool for your adversaries), and deciding which card will be using its ability means a lot of meaningful choices without getting swamped in them. The variable end of each round means you can get hosed if it comes quicker as expected (meaning the round order is deciding whether you cab cash in your last set), but that also results in a spike in tension keeping the tension arc fluctuating.The game has some drawbacks as well. First, the theme is clearly a paste-on. The map is a copy of Slovakia (why?). The gamebox is a thematic mismatch: it promises war and mayhem, where the 'conflict' is more along the lines of El Grande. But the biggest drawback is the big luck of the draw. If you draw a perfect set, you're golden. If you draw all different, basically you are both wasting turns as setting your adversaries up for even bigger sets. Keeping what you have is only a very limited option, as you don't have much knowledge about the hands of your adversaries. This is a big thing, as Ethnos is a strategic game at hearth, and in those games a big luck factor has too much impact on your plans.That being said, this is an excellent game: enjoyable, engaging, very playable and not too lengthy, with meaningful choices along the way. As someone that generally dislikes set-collection games, this game is highly recommended, especially for those that like this mechanic!

A quick playing game that combines Small World and Ticket to Ride, without surpassing either of those games. My main issue with the game is that it is tactical instead of being strategic. You cannot really plan ahead, the luck of the draw will determine whether you will have a good run or not. The modular scoring of the board and the big variety of races can help to keep the game fresh from play to play and increase the replay value. Drawing the dragon cards was also really fun, it's a great timer mechanism in the game. I wouldn't mind playing this, but wouldn't seek it out either.

Ethnos is a mix between [thing=9209][/thing] and Rummy.  You collect cards and play sets (bands) of matching colors or races to play in front of you.  By playing a set, you score points based on the set size and get to place a piece on one of the six regions.  At the end of each round, points are awarded for majority of the regions.  So, this all feels similar to TTR in that you are collecting sets, scoring points for big sets, and placing pieces on the board competing for limited real estate against your opponents.

There are two good things going for the game.  First is that when you play a set of cards, you have to discard your remaining cards to the market.  So, unlike TTR, you don't accumulate like 30 cards in hand before you start playing sets.  It also makes it painful to keep drawing cards trying to find that last one you want.  Secondly, each race has a unique power and the available races is randomized each game.  This gives a little more decision space to work with.

Ultimately, it felt like I was playing a slightly-more-gamer-y version of TTR.  I'm not sure I really need another family-style lightweight game like this, but it's certainly inoffensive and could be a good filler plus at the beginning or end of the night.

I really like this. It’s like ticket to ride, but instead of collecting trains you’re collecting fantasy races, and instead of playing sets to connect routes on the board, you’re playing them to gain area majorities on the board. Plus each set you play gives you different abilities depending on the fantasy race of its leader, which adds some neat card combo opportunities.

This game is an absolute delight. It might not be the most robust thing out there, but it delivers a laser focus on drawing choice cards, making cool moves, and praying that third dragon doesn't show up.

Typically I like my games as complicated as you can make them, but there are always exceptions. Ethos is so straightforward you could almost categorize it as a Rule Breaking mechanic game... Basically you have a short and simple set of rules about determining area controls across a three round game. The excitement comes in with the fact you have 12 races (sets of card faces) of which you will randomly take 6, and each race has a single effect and each set of cards (band) you put down will borrow the effects of its top and area targeting card (leader). This takes a game otherwise all about band size and control degrees and complicates it by adding "cheat" effects bypassing normal rules, granting or advancing features of your plays, or providing new sources of victory points to compete over. Strategy is absolutely key, but there is no simple,pattern of "winning strategy" anyone can doggedly abuse... The relation between elements is simple, their constant flux is not. Playing well relies on being adaptive... Reacting to what other players do, choosing your battles to avoid conflicts more brutal than they're worth or to sweep in and edge out a foe, strike while the iron is hot when opportunities arise, prioritize pressing luck for a drastic play or counting on small victories to add up, and most of all, while RNG doesn't actively ruin or overly bless a player normally, making the best of the cards dumped into the communal drafting area and randomly dealt from the deck (and knowing when to do which!) all favor a player willing to roll with lunches and alter their strategy from one turn to another... Talents that rarely will one player in a circle have a monopoly on.

Aside from a varied play experience that rewards smart plays but should rarely preclude or guarentee any player in victory; the greatest virtue of Ethnos is how fast it is. Simple to learn and tach, minimal setup and tear down, turns are lightning fast (pull a card and pass turn more often than not), which makes for a game that can fit a match into small time window and wont clash with players who struggle waiting for their turn in games where turns are long, or who struggle with long games. Meanwhile, the box, board, cards, and pieces are all really nicely done, smooth, attractive, good art. The box interior was another thing I really appreciated... It's designed with shaped grooves for every one of the fair amount of extraneous pieces... Each has a place and it's obvious where it is, and they all slide in securely and space efficiently. It's gloriously well organized, honestly.... I normally use baggies to sort and consolidate games into smaller and more orderly parcels than the box... Ethnic is one of few exception where it's exemption isn't based on the box being to packed... Instead, it's just so wel organize and aesthetic as is, it feels foolish to repackage.

Honestly, I feel like I can hardly reccomend this game enough. It may lack the sharp complexity of games like Scythe or Valeria Card Kingdoms, but it's just so good at what it does, I adore it.... More similar to Hero Realms in its virtue: brilliant out of the box, gets you down to enjoying it quickly, basic variety keeps it fresh, victory is fair but not rigid, and like the comparison, easy on the wallet... Copies are going for 40 retail and you may manage to shave off ten bucks or so if you use discount sources. It's a great approachable game for everyone... The elves and wizards and skeletons may turn off the really stiff relatives who won't touch anything nerdier than Catan, but it's honestly so simple and straightforward I'd think no dedicated board game player would be turned off.

First play impression: This is pure fun.

The game plays almost identically to Royals (slowly draw cards, then play sets of cards to place markers in various areas on the map). However, I felt like Royals was lacking something to push it beyond mediocre, and I think Ethnos adds the perfect element.

Ethnos adds a mechanic similar to Guildhall where each suit of cards has a unique ability and the ability is often stronger if you play more of those cards. This addition takes the barebones experience of Royals and adds combos, strategy, and more to think about. Also, you play with a different combination of cards each time so the experience will be quite a bit different from game to game.

I will say that there may be a fair amount of luck, which was also prevalent in Royals. You often end up drawing blindly from the deck and if you happen to get cards that match then you'll be in a better position. Sometimes you draw several times and none of the cards match color or type. I imagine the luck should even out over the course of the game, though.

Overall lots of fun. The ability to play from 3-6 players is nice and I imagine the game would work equally well with 4-6 (with three players you have to play a variant).

Update: After more plays the game is still great. I've seen people consider this a new gateway game and I can definitely see that. There's still a decent amount of luck of the draw but so far not enough to hinder the experience.

I also need to mention the player count. The game plays surprisingly well with three players, despite area control usually needing more players. More importantly, though, I've seen a number of reviewers talk about how perfectly this game scales at [b]all[/b] player counts and that is just wrong.

The two player game is bad. Sure, we all know that area control games don't work with two players, but it just needs to be restated here. I played a two player game just to show a friend how the game works and we aborted the game after the first age because it was so bad and there was nothing fun or interesting about the experience. The game already has a lot of luck, but with two players it comes down to pure luck. If you draw the right cards to take over the valuable areas and carry out some combos, you will win. With more players you have people discarding cards to the face-up draw row at different intervals, so timing is crucial as you try to wait out your opponents to see if they discard a card you've been waiting on. With two players you draw and discard at about the same pace so it just doesn't work.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 3-6[/b]

"Ticket to Ride for area control", as Tom Vasel calls this, sounds like an awesome thing. And it supports 2-6 players! My only problem is that the game doesn't look exciting in the slightest - the card artwork is probably ok, but the card layout and the main board are really bland and boring.

Felt like a very unoriginal idea, with a good amount of luck of the draw heaped on top.  Also the map is awful and the stock Lord of the Rings-ish art seems badly dated.

All that said, it was actually an enjoyable (if not thrilling) experience.  There's several extra sets of cards included so that you can virtually play hundreds of different card combinations, which is really nice.

It's actually a pretty decent game that I would play again.

I was wowed by low player count playthroughs. The issue is that the deck does not scale with player count. With more players, each player simply gets fewer turns. At high player counts, area control is more important than the set collection. The drafting and set collection looked like the more interesting mechanics. This may be a good game at low player counts, but a miss at higher. I may try this game again with fewer players, but probably not.

RATING: 7
Ethnos is an area control game that's card based.  There are six regions.  At the beginning of the game the value of each region for each of the rounds is randomly determines by assigning VP tiles to each region.  The deck of cards has six colors (matching the regions) and six races (each with a special power).

On your turn you draw a card or play a "band".  A band is either a set of cards all of a color, or all of a race.  The purpose of playing a band is to put a disc in the region of the color that is the top card in your band (the leader).  Your band must have cards in excess of the number of discs you currently have in that region.  Additionally you do the special power of the band's leader's race.  When you play a band, any cards that aren't played to the band are put face up into a common area from which players may draw cards.  You can choose any cards in the common tableau or from the face down deck.  There are dragons randomly seeded in the bottom of the deck and when you find them all the round ends immediately.  

At the end of a round, all the regions are scored.  In the first round, only the first VP chit in each region is scored.  The player with the most discs in an area gets those points. Discs stay in regions from round to round.  In the second round the first and second place chits are scored and given respectively to the players with the most and second most discs.  And all three score in the third round, going to 1st, 2nd and 3rd most discs.

Additionally, you get points for the length of your bands that you've played.  A single card is worth zero points but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 cards are worth 1, 3, 6, 10, 15 points.  

The races change up the rules of how things work in interesting ways.  there's a good bit to think about.  There's some randomness with cards, which is okay.  Other players may inadvertently mess you up.   But overall I liked this game a lot.

This game just went up again from an 8-9.  It is really good.  Fast, fun, variable.  It is about a 7-8 with 3 players, since you only play 2 ages, and the game really gets exciting when the 3rd age kicks in.  With that said it at its best with 4.  But is not lulled down with 5 or 6.   So it is a great, still fast, and slightly bigger game, to bring out with groups of 6.  Even some of your Party-Game/ Ticket To Ride only friends, might be able to play this one, if they want to venture into broader games.

Just get this one.  With all of the games I own, I think about and want to play this one often.

Easy to teach, Quick to set up, and well it's just that good.

1st impression: Ticket to ride only faster and fun? Set collection meets abstract area of influence. Nicely paced, the turns fly by and each age feels distinct. Little elements of push your luck add some excitement and the way that discards form the common pool add a nice feel of player interaction. A superior game to TtR in every way except that the theme is at odds with the gameplay. This would work as a gateway game except you'll never get a  fantasy war game to the table with non-gamers. If you have a group interested in fantasy war games, would they want to play something this light and accessible? Neither scenario is likely. A filler while you wait for your TI4 players to arrive?

Please never again.  This nearly defies game description.  There are points where it is a game and you have real decisions to make.  Those points are rare.  Most of the turns are automatic and drawing a card off the top of the deck.  Who has the best top decking skills?  Who can draw the best set?  I would classify this as more of an activity than a game.  Very little control of outcomes or strategy.

Oh man, so good.  So quick, so interesting, so variable.  Love it! I wish the theme was more approachable because this design has potential to be as popular as Ticket to Ride.

Cards are collected into sets simply by drawing them, similar to [thing=18100][/thing] or [thing=9209][/thing].  But when turning in sets there's the twist of giving up the remaining hand and making those cards available to other players.  Basic scoring is area majority and sets collected.  Games feature six of twelve available characters offering different strategies each game.  High points are simple and variable game play enabling big and quick multi-player games.  Excellent design, but feels a derivative mish-mash.  The thin theme emphasizes that point.  On the cusp of being a classic multi-player game, but needs more theme, conflict, or something.  Or maybe just more plays....

I had the pleasure to follow the birth and shaping of Ethnos through the years and I must say I am quite happy with the final result!
 We played it in its finally published form, with the author of course, and it has been a very enjoyable experience.
 I think the aspects I prefer more about the game are its rhythm, its core idea, its simplicity and the tension it provides.
 It's always your turn, or so it seems, and you don't have "dead" moments.
 The sacrifice you need to make when you play cards and discard the rest of your hand is what I loved from the start and it's a very very good idea!
 Rules are quite simple and yet you have a lot of replayability thanks to the dozen different tribes.
 The thrill you have when waiting for the third dragon while you are trying to put that last disc is very exciting.
 
 Is the art that bad? Well, I don't think so. Drawings are quite nice even if not exactly my genre. I think the main problem is the colours are a bit dull and not discernible enough; also, they are quite sad while not giving enough "epic" feeling. Honestly, it's not so easy to tell apart one or two colours on the board. But the art itself is something more of a personal taste and I don't mind it so much: I love it when it's gorgeous but I don't care that much when it's not. I think I don't like very much the discs: they don't pile quite well. The rest of the material is of good quality.

The 0.03 is just to make my rating not so easy to guess.

On the up side, this game is simple to learn and quick to play. On the down side, it's just rummy and I don't know why anyone would think that is interesting. Also, since so many people have commented on the art... I think the art is great in a vacuum, but when you have hard to distinguish muddy brown images replace the card's suit, the art is not doing its job.

After three plays, I found this to be a solid area majority and set collection game. The side components for certain races were also cool.

Clearly some luck to the game based on the card draws. I'm also a little concerned that the Trolls are a little unbalanced. I also was surprised at the component quality for a CMON game - this seems way below their typical level of quality. Finally, the artwork felt bland to me when compared to "prettier" games with a similar theme (example, Small World). 

All of that said, this is a fun gateway game, a great area control that can scale 2-4 players, and a fun way to spend 45-60 minutes. All things considered, this one was a surprise 10 for me. Here's to hoping for a really nice Deluxe edition someday! :)

Good game. I watched a few reviews before buying the game. But the game deserves its reputation. The mechanics are quite simple, but there is much going on. The game should play quickly once everyone understands what they are doing. Sometimes, it is your turn before you even know it, so there is little down time. The game is about area control and card set collection. You collect sets to control the areas based on the color of the card or the type of creature on the card. When and how to develop the card sets is a part of the riddle. It is interesting how points are distributed through the three rounds. The first round is the longest and the second and third rounds are much shorter because you need more cards in order to place more influence on the board. As a result, the deck which acts as the time clock runs out much more quickly. How the points are distributed on the board, will influence where you play your cards and what type of sets you are trying to collect. The card you lead with has special powers. Knowing the special powers requires a little memorization although the basic information is on the card. The need to memorize actions leads to my only issue with the game. They should have cardboard aids for the specific powers of each type of creature in the game. When I have played with new players, more than once players who are unfamiliar with the game need to go through the rules for a full explanation of the creatures powers. This is a minor issue, but it would have been a nice touch to have. It is also true that just about any theme could be put on this game. If the magical lore turns someone who you might play with off, then I would advise against this game. The magical lore does not bother me and is a justification for the powers on the cards. It is the land of Ethnos and there is a clear theme that fits well with this game. I do see room for expanding this game by adding new cards, a new map, and possibly and/or new ways to score. However, expansions would depend on the success of this game.

Probably the best CMON game that doesn't include minis. This is my favourite kind of game, in the sense that it epitomizes "easy to learn, hard to master". You either take a card or play a hand of cards - but timing is everything in this game. The little nuances are what make this game shine, like only using 6 out of 10 very distinct factions (increasing replayability) or the game ending on the third dragon card rather than simply running out of cards.

A 2-6 player area control game. Grab cards from a central market or the deck and try to build sets of the same race or color to place your token in that area. Each race has its own special ability, but when you make a set you have to place the rest of your cards back on the market for others.

Pretty basic area control with a very unique card driven placement mechanism.  The cards you draw are largely random, but whenever you lay a set any left over cards go into a TTR-esque drawing line so there is certainly some luck mitigation to be had. There is also incentive in points to try to build as large a set as possible balanced against having the round end before you are ready for it which adds some nice tension.  The variable region scoring and large number of special power cards should add some nice extra replayability to Ethnos too.

One of the worst games I played recently. Area control game that is just not fun. 80% of the game, you are just drawing cards from blind deck, and has a runaway leader problem. We played World's fair 1893 afterwards and it does everything better. Oh, and the board is map of Slovakia, if someone is interested.

Fun 2-6 player - great for family - race across planks. Must place stones as foundation. Each turn you must place 5 action cards a la Robo Rally and reveal one phase at a time. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
First play: Beautiful components and fun gameplay make this a very attractive prospect. It does have a mean streak however and the game is over very quickly - this can be an anti-climax.

On a second play, I found the game to be lacking something. It feels like there should be more going on here. As it is, there is precious little real strategy. Roborally, or even Wings of War, feel like more successful uses of the programming mechanic.

First play with 6, and we enjoyed it quite a bit. I love that you can use others' paths, and also mess with each other, but it's not always guaranteed to work, as they might've done something you didn't expect which then makes you fall into the water. And cool bits as well.

RATING: 6.5
+ It's a kid-friendly game that is actually fun and enjoyable by the whole group; The visuals of the board, planks, and figures moving around is just great.
- Too chaotic for some; The components are so vital, yet the planks are warping which is a major issue.


Why it's previously-owned:
This would be amazing if it had metal components encased in rubber.  They wouldn't bend or warp, and there wouldn't be tons of sliding.  As it was, the game was marred by too many issues arising from the pieces themselves.
This got traded for Alea Iacta Est.

1st play: Wow, I'm really glad I got talked into playing this.  I expected very little but I fell in love with it.  Instant wishlist.  Programmable movement with amazing production and plays well with 6.  I don't know how well it does at lower player counts, but I hear there's a giant version of it.  Simple rules, fun spatial building element and quick playtime.

2nd play: Still very cool, but a bit of a group experience, and if everyone at the table isn't into it, it's not QUITE as good.  That said, I still found it fun to watch people run the wrong directions and fall into rivers and stuff.  Light enough that I was able to add a non-gamer to the table and everyone still had fun.

Our family really likes this game. Weve never played on the side with the drawn stones. The only thing we don't like is the size of the stones. Too small. One bump and everything falls down and our characters are drowning. Still a lot of fun though. It is so cool when you program your move right and you jump over another player, though that rarely happens for me and I usually end up in the river.

This is a fun game if you're looking for something undemanding to play.  There's a little stategy but it's still simple enough and has enough of a "luck element" that it's a fun game to break out when you have a group that doesn't normally play games and want to give them a gentle introduction.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Great little filler. Very chaotic, as you have to program 5 moves at a time, but the chaos does not really matter. A little more subtle than it looks, especially with things like the restrictions on what planks you can have in hand, and thus which ones you can pick up, and the limit of 3 planks per stone. So you can mess people up in obvious ways, but in more subtle ways, too.

RATING: 6
A nice board and components make the game pleasurable to play.  If you can suspend disbelieve about how exactly stones are laid down on the other side of a gap - then it can even make some thematic sense.  But it is basically a bit of a puzzle race.  How to manipulate the planks in such a way to get you from point A to point B first.  The game is surprising in that it works pretty well with different numbers of players.  Falls into the long playing super filler.  That can make it harder to get on the table if people would prefer a meatier game in the same time frame.

Mooi spel, met kleurrijke plankjes, originele opzet.

De draken zijn pestkaarten.
Het ganse spel is nogal gebaseerd op raden wat je tegenstanders van plan zijn, en dat verhinderen.
Veel geluk dus !
Anderzijds geen dobbelstenen of kaarten "trekken".  Alles is zelf gekozen.

Luchtig, en daardoor wel makkelijk speelbaar.
Graag opnieuw.

Roberto Fraga game of abstract strategy. It can be funny but you need a good number of players. You need good space intelligence, and I'm not strong at that.

RATING: 7
Very impressed with the first few games. Uses a game mechanic I love. This mechanic isn't referred to specifically on the geek, but I refer to it as "forecasting". -It's a strategic game where you lay out your best plan a couple turns in advance. You're bound to your earlier decisions but the scenario changes greatly based on what the other players do.
Makes for tense, funny games.

RATING: N/A
Another fun game. Lay bridges trying to cross from one side of the board to the other. The problem? You can only estimate with your eyes the distance and the bridge length required. Also, play cards in a Roborally, programmed movement that can really mess up your own and/or someone else's plans. Good game for end of the evening silliness. Just don't play it with anyone that takes their gaming too seriously.

River dragons is a card programming game where you build bridges and move your character to his home first. Some cards place stones, some build bridges on the stones, and some move your character, but the catch is that you must enact all your cards in order, so there is potential for your plans to be foiled.

Very simple family weight game that does card programming successfully.

Really like this with 2 or 3. Quite a tactical game with lots of screwage and some unexpected consequences. Shorter than you might think. Tried it once with 6 and it just seemed too chaotic and short for a decent 6p game. Particularly like the Roborally-like 5 card programming (though unlike RR you have quite a lot of flexibility e.g. which plank to lay or pick up).

A game that I thought I'd like as I like robo-rally. Unfortunately the chaos in the game makes the programming largely irrelevant, in robo-rally things can go wrong, usually of your own making - but it seems fun. Here you plan, it goes wrong and it feels frustrating. Lots of options for kingmaking and hammering the leader, by about half-way through I really just wanted it to end.

This is another in the category of "could be a really good game, but somehow isn't."  Five preplanned actions might be just too many.  In fairness, it could be me as I never get the balance between moving forword and disrupting others right.  I tend to go too far one way or the other.

We had a lot of laughs with this game, not because it is a humorous game, but because the dang bridges and people kept falling over, and over, and over.

[thing=634][/thing] is fantastic with my tiny table toppers. The only modification we make is that my little guy gets to choose his card each turn. So, he can sort through his cards and react to the game play as it unfolds. BUT he is limited like the rest of us in that once he has played a card he has to put it aside and wait until everyone resets their decks to be able to chose those cards again (if this makes sense).

This makes the game super fun for everyone. As an adult you need to try and predict the actions of everyone (including a little kid) like you would in a normal game. The children love it because the game is beautiful, it has dragons, and they get to see mommy and daddy splash into the water!

Highly, highly recommend this game - it unifies generations.

This game does an amazing number of things wrong. It is a programmed actions game, but the amount of in-system chaos makes programming them a complete crap shoot most of the time.

Great double-think/triple-think/quadruple-think/etc game!

"I know that you know that I know that you know that I know, so I'm going to play this card first. I think. Wait, hmm."

It can be a bit crowd-dependent, so best experienced when played festive and silly. First time I played was with six family members and it was over quick and fell a bit flat. Second time was with a couple of kids at church and it was an epic, strategic contest with some really clever play...and the youngest won. It really was one of those moments where board gaming was at its best.

Update: played it with four and it works really well at that number, so 3 or 4 players is the sweet spot. When playing with just three players, try this variant: Allow multiple dragons to be played any given round. Lengthens the game, but still plays fast enough and takes the interaction to a new level.

This one is light chaotic fun with good screwage.  Programming your moves is tough, because you need to try to predict your opponents' likely actions as well as consider your own relative position.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Superficially a bit roborally like with players programming 5 actions then revealing them simultaneously and resolving in turn. As with roborally, it could be a good bit of fun if not taken too seriously since it can become a bit random with bluffing about what action to take. This also has a harder "screw you" edge with explicit cards which prevent a player's action.
It was quite fiddly to play though as the stones slip a bit on the glossy board and removing a plank almost always causes a few others to slide off thier perch. This made it a bit frustrating.
Not good, but nothing really bad either. Meh.

Here's a case where you have a great idea for a game, and lovely art and components, which doesn't work in practice. The overlapping bridges balance precariously on the supports, and are so fiddly that we knocked them over nearly every turn.

Fun but fiddly game. I'd love this game if I could change a few things about it. Namely that the planks rarely stay in place so you spend half the game trying to fix what you have already built. Secondly the card art and iconography isn't that clear, or could be much clearer. I'd love the game if it wasn't for that,as it is I found it frustrating.

Incredible production!  The game itself is like a variant of Chinese checkers with programmed actions.   I don't think the dragon cards are a good feature, but one could easily leave those out.   I do wish the planks were a bit stickier so that sliding rocks and planks weren't an issue.   It's not a dexterity game!   Just incredible to look at.

Könnyed családi játék. És még a gyermekeim is imádják (3 és 5). (látszik a játékszámból, még csak vbelük játszottam, de sokszor) Igaz a kisebbiknek még azért bonyolult, de imádja a Sárkányos kártyát, és a rózsaszín bábut :-). A nagyobb azonban - bár az első 2-3-4  partiban ő is az akadályozást éklvezet, de miután rádöbbent, h az jó ugyan, de úgy nem biztos, h nyer, elkezdett taktikusan játszani, tervezni. Persze mivel gyerekekkel játszunk, így azért könnyített játék: nem kell precíznek lenni, ha elmozdul egy kő, hát elmozdul, lehet állítgatni, igazgatni... de élvezik.
Nyilván nagyobbak, vagy parti játékként erre nem lenne lehetőség adva, illetve ott a gonoszkodások jobban tervezettek lenének. Ahogy a nagyobbik mondta: apa ketten is jó, de többen nagyobb kihívás, izgalmasabb. Logikus: többen kavarhatnak be az életedbe, több akadály, több tiltás.
A játék maga:
A házunktól kell a vízen át kelve egy másik házig eljutni a szigeteken keresztül, ehhez köveket teszünk le, azokra pallókat, lépkedünk, ha jön szembe vki ugrunk, lebontunk pallókat, és persze egy sárkánnyal az adott színű  játékos akadályozzuk.
van 9 kártyánk+annyi és olyan színű sárkánykártyánk, amennyi amilyen ellenfél. ebből kell 5-öt kiválasztani, képpel lefelé kijátszási sorrendbe  magunk  elé tenni. Majd egyesével felfedni, végrehajtani -mindenki 1 akciót, 1 kártyát, aztán újabb kör. 
Na aztán persze ha vki bekavar akkor van vízbecsobbanás, ácsorgás, és baj: hisz lehet, h az utána tervezett mind mehet a levesbe.
Ennyi. Egyszerű szabályok, de előretervezés, másik terveinek figyelése, akadályozása, de főképp saját utunk gyorsítása, akadályok kerülése. 3 évesnek még nem igazán való, de tetszik neki. A nagyobb (jó 5,5 éves) viszont meglepően taktikusan előretervez, figyel, kalkulál. A játék ugyan 8 és fölötte, de szerintem kellő figyelemmel 6 éves kortól is simán játszható.
Felnőttekkel pedig igazán funny játék, gonoszkodással, keresztbetevéssel, sok nevetéssel.
És ne hagyjam ki azt se, h Matagot kiadás: és gyönyörű

This is for the older version under the name of Dragon Delta. I like the premise of the game but it is a bit shallow for two players.  It plays better and is more interesting with more players.

Usually plays quick, so this fits in as a decent filler game for me.

[2 plays] I had fun playing this game, but two plays confirmed that it has a characteristic I don't like.  I've seen this in Attike (though hear that could be different with different # of players) and some other games, though I forget what else.  It's a spatial game where everyone can see everyone else's progress, and there's blocking and smiting.  So when someone is about to win, everyone else can go into "bash the leader to prolong the game" mode, a la Munchkin.  Or there can be quarrels about who's got to stop X, instead of benefiting themselves more directly.  If you don't stop the person who's about to win, they win and you lose... but if you DO stop that person, then while you're "taking one for the team," a 3rd person who's been using his turns for his own advantage wins and you lose.  Or everyone notices that one person's about to win and goes all out to stop them, but meanwhile another person who was almost as close but flying under the radar will surge ahead and win.  I just don't like games where the endgame is all about frantically trying to prevent everyone else from winning.

I never like games where you spend all your time guessing what others will do and none on actual strategy. I also don't like to have my plans ruined. At least: not in games that take over 30 minutes where you can't really have a plan b, c or d. It's fine if I get totally screwed in Agricola or Vanuatu for example, that's just part of the game :)

[Dexterity, Programmed Actions, Network Connection] <6P:2, 5P:2> A game where players lay "planks" on "stones" to build bridgeways from one island to another. The dexterity component that Dragon Delta is supposed to have (placing bridges on the stones) just doesn't work. Using the "remove a bridge" action is likely to collapse entire sections of the board setup. The chaos in the game is just overwhelming - it's not possible to get anything done by design. Once your bridge looks like it's set up, just keep picking the movement actions and hope that a way exists for you to get to your objective. Some nice ideas here, but the execution is just plain unworkable. You can TRY to play Dragon Delta as written, but just like what happens to the stones-and-bridges setup during the game, I'm gonna call this one broken. Shame, the game looks pretty good.

I like the idea of bridge building and undesired cooperation by walking across opponent's bridges. The rest of the game, however, is a chaotic programmation fest where anything can happen. This chaos somehow works in Robotrally but fails here, probably because its too easy to block a specific opponent... The fact that 3-bridges-on-a-stone can be used to lock a path is really nasty too, as it can make life impossible for a player.

I got this looking for a quick multi-player filler that would be a change of pace from the usual.  I was right about it being a change of pace, but wrong about it always being quick, as it has the potential to slow down upon over analysis.  I disagree with comments saying this is Roborally lite.  Dragon Delta does share the simultaneous action selection mechanic with Robo, but because the hand in which you use to create your actions is always identical, bluff and double think become more prevalent.  I don't think Dragon Delta offers the unbridled whimsy Roborally does, but for what it's worth it offers a solid game with interesting decisions and a relativly quick playing time.  Delta is definetly more strategic with less players, but the chaotic madness six brings is lots of fun.  

UPDATE:  I am starting to edge to Dragon Delta's side over Roborally.  Alright I admit Roborally has soured on me, but this game is becoming more intriguing.  As I mentioned in my initial rant, with Delta's cards always being the same each hand, and the same for each player, the decisions are much deeper than in Roborally (where the only real game is solving the puzzle presented before you. Yeah, the robots interact but seldomly because you chose to hinder your opponents - more oft than not Roborally is a solitaire gaming experience played out on the same board. ) 

UPDATE: What a few years can do.  Played the new version and was largely underwhelmed. Maybe this game is dependent on the group? But I have a fun-loving group of guys I play with, so maybe I have grown away from this design.Score reflects a drastic drop from 6 to 4.

A pretty fun game that is kind of simalr in play, as Robo Rally. I definitely like this one with 3-4 players more so, than with 2. It just didn't feel right, as a 2 player game.

Game play is very easy to teach/learn and game play moves pretty quick, with hardly any down time. Fun game! Check it out.

Easy to teach; easy to play.  Cutthroat strategy if played with right people.  Simultaneous action selection...yeah...Also, we (wife and I) really enjoy this two player.  I know if you take it as a 'filler' game, then two players may be boring, but there is a lot of get in the other people's head kind of strategy in a 2 player game.  I'm going to say the same thing about it that I say about Citadels - it s fun with a lot of players, but it s strategic with two.

Edit: does get a little boring if your opponent(s) take it as a 'filler' game and aren't really that focused on winning.

RATING: 5
2 - 6 players

A simple game with programmed actions that is hampered somewhat by the dexterity required to not knock everything over.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like this game mostly for its ability to reach youth, 10 years and up.  It has lots of different components: The programming of the cards, visual abilities (is the bridge long enough), dexterity, and a certain amount of bluffing.  It is also cute, and the rules are quick to explain.  It is also very interractive, and many of your moves affect your neighbors.  I like to describe this as Robo Rally lightened up 3 orders of magnitude.  

The game itself has a few detractors for more experienced gamers.  One being that inexperienced gamers are increadibly difficult to predict.  The other is that analysis paralisis can be an issue.  In my experience, the one player who is not blocked by chance gains a quick win (about the 4th, 5th round) while everyone else is messing with each other.  This makes the win somewhat random.

RATING: 5
A racing game based around a programming mechanism requiring that the players interpret space visually and including a relatively strong blocking element.  The above is a list of things I dislike and also a good description of Dragon Delta.  

So, the real thing that requires explanation is why I didn't hate it more--essentially, it's relatively low-pressure, with a limited number of options and a relatively quick way across the board, so it is likely that all players will have a chance, no matter how inept.

Jumping card seems underpowered for the risk involved. (1 play)

The basic idea behind the game is nice, but it doesn't work so well in practice. It's hard to avoid moving the stones, and the board layout is liable to fall to pieces as you manipulate it. It would be much better if the system was quantised somehow. There's also a lot of luck involved (based on a 5 player game - probably better with fewer).

3-6 players? A racing game with action cards, programming, and take that. Similar to Colt Express. Video 70514 shows gameplay with less player interaction than Colt Express, less excitement than Colt Express, and take-that cards (dragon cards) that seem more frustrating than funny; though, this was a 2-player session with a kid, and I assume a session with a group of adults would be much better. One reviewer confirmed that dragon cards are frustrating (/article/18523199#18523199). Would players sitting around a big table need to stand up to place their stones and planks?

Based on one play (four players) so take with a grain of salt.  This is a light game that did not capture my imagination.  The concept of building bridges is a neat idea, and I can see myself liking a game with programmed moves if implemented differently.  Unfortunately, this game just seemed slow and tedious for the small amount of fun there was to be had.  However, I could see this being a great game for teaching kids to plan ahead and to develop spatial skills.

Vooraf moet iedereen vijf acties in een zelf te kiezen volgorde vastleggen (vb. plank/steen leggen, 1 plank verder gaan, 2 planken verder gaan, over ander poppetje springen, plank/steen wegnemen, draak (andere speler mag niet spelen),...).

It's as though someone took Robo Rally and decided to remove all the fun while keeping all of the irritating elements from that game, and then added the dragons to make the game even more irritating and frustrating.  A cancel mechanism could work in Robo Rally, where there are numerous move cards.  But when a player has only two chances to move in any given turn, having moves cancelled is devastating and amounts to lost turns.  The board is also much less interesting than in Robo Rally.  Simple isn't necessarily better.  One positive to this game is that it's short, so that it won't take long to finish and move on to a better game.

Completely unlike any of Roberto Fraga's other games, in that there is no real time or dexterity element.  The components are nice and the theme is original enough, making for a fun experience.  It seems like it would be a little too easy with fewer players - we played with 6 and it was quite challenging.  It takes a certain kind of player to not get upset playing this type of game.  There's a lot of bash the leader and a ton of blind luck.  At some point it becomes impossible to try and stop other players and someone will skate through unimpeded, which is good because this would feel most comfortable to me as a 30-minute filler.  Since there is so little planning possible, the longer it extends above 30 minutes sucks the fun out of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A complete improvement of the game. Usually I don't feel the need to update to new versions, but this one looks so much better than the original version that I had to do it. I do have to say that usability is a minor concern. The planks (while looking nicer) are not stable enough to support the weight of the new, improved meeples.

I would really love to get a copy of the large version that Roberto Fraga takes to conventions - it is a thing of beauty and the first player marker is amazing.

Interesting little filler game. It uses preplanned moves and players must try to outguess their opponent in order to cross the river.

In Dragon Delta, you want to move your pawn over a system of bridge-like planks to the other side of the board. An easy task! Or at least it would be if everyone were working together, but alas you're not. Instead you're all working on your own right next to one another, each convinced that your way is best.

I like the idea of the game, but I would prefer having it as a 100% dexterity game rather than an analog board game. The other element I don't like is the fact that you must plan all your moves in advance. It's really hard to think up of a strategy, playing them randomly is not necesarily worst.

A lighter game where you use cards to "program" your turn.  This game can be a bit random at times but there is some nice strategy in figuring out how you can do what you need to do without being totally blocked by another player.  You really need to outwit and outplay your opponents to be successful.

Excellent components.

Plays fairly quickly too. For what it is, this is a very good game and I can see this being a good light-weight filler.

It is excellent for what it is. You have to kind of know what you're getting into with this.

Recommend it with 4 or 5.

We fished this out after many years for family play over the Christmas holidays.  Great fun, we've found for 2, 3 or 4 players (we haven't tried with more than that) with 3 perhaps having the slight edge for close and exciting games.

Our 8 year old can play this at the same level as the rest of us and greatly enjoys formulating "sneaky plans".  

A light game and chaotic but it's great when you've out-guessed your opponent and ruined their perfect plan.

Nice Connection Game. I really enjoy the mechanism used to allocate your turns. There is some strong backstabbing at the heart of this game, which I find integrated tightly within the theme, and increases the sense of control and helplessness that occurs with each turn of the action cards. Feels much like a cross of Twixt (a favorite) and Richocet Robots. The only downside for me is the quality of the bridge components.

Technically my copy is the Dragon Delta, but whatever. Fun party game. Minor bluffing strategy, some table talk and diplomacy, and a frenzied finish make this a fun non-serious game that many enjoy. I prefer Survive! over this for same feeling, but I get why others like this as well.

Interesting mechanic that can foil even the best laid plans. There is no one strategy that seems to work with this game which is part of why I like it.  Good with 4 or more.  I taught it to the 8yr olds at work, they got addicted to this game almost as quickly as they did to Citadels.

A simple, but colourful dexterity game combined with light programming. You plan out the movement of your character, anticipating your opponents moves, trying to be the first to get across the water. I really love the production of the game, but it is probably a bit light for my taste, and it's unfortunate that the board is unwilling to lay completely flat which is crucial to play.

RATING: 7
A game of screw your neighbor and second guessing.  The concept is simple, build planks across the islands then travel across those planks to the village on the other end.    Not so fast!  Each round consists of a series of 5 programmed moves using cards which allow you to move along planks, place stones, place planks along stones, remove planks, void another player's programmed move, etc.  It gets quite nasty.  For example if you had programmed to move forward one plank and the planks on each side of you had been subsequently removed, splash!  You're now a wet sop and need to swim back to your village.

Components make playing difficult at best. Placing stones and planks feels arbitrary due to the committal "touch move" rules. Planks easily fall off of the stones when moving pieces, and the actual strategic elements of navigating the river are paper thin with only two direct movement cards from up to 13 to choose from.

This game plays best with 6 and is an absolute hit with non-gamers. The components are stunning; It's pure eye candy and the fun doesn't stop there. It's a very simple game with a fun programming mechanic. This constantly keeps you on your toes and the slightest misstep can change the whole flow of a turn. Other players have the ability to play a dragon card against you which takes away one of your moves in a turn. The game is unpredictable, fun, and easy enough for my young kids to enjoy.

 The spectacular components are the best part of this game.  It looks beautiful setup. My daughters like the game well enough.  For me though,  I find the game play to be okay.  The planks that one needs to place are very light weight and when placed are very tippy.  And don't bump the table!  Planks and figures end up "in the drink" with the dragon.
I play it with my kids occasionally but there are other games that I try to stir them to first. 

Update: We have been playing this game more since my wife has now found a liking for it.  With more plays under our belts I'm finding it to be a bit more strategic than at first blush.  Bumping it to a 7.5 due to my non-gaming wife coming on board with this one.

Not a bad filler game (its not a brain burner).  I like the programming aspect of laying out your turn (ala' Robo Rally).  Have only tried 2-player, need to play with more.

There is a lot of maneuvering to try to get into a position to win.  BUT its a bit of a crap shoot sometimes as to who wins (it just depends on the order of the cards played).

A must for any family. Planning your cards and how to lay them for your moves makes this a strategic family game. This is played at least a few times a month. It is a beautiful game and can scale well as a filler game for the adults, or any age. But it really ROCKS as a family game:-)

This game is just plain fun! Easy to learn, also. A must have for the collection. You have dragons, cards, pawns to move, and stones and planks to play. This game has been fun to play from the very first game. My 8-year old daughter, Sara, is very good at the game and often wins. The proper selection and sequence of your 5 cards/actions can be fun and frustrating all at the same time. The dragon veto cards and the remove one plank or stone MUST be played judiciously, and in my opiniion, EVERY turn.

RATING: 6
The idea is to get your guy from your home village to a village on the other side of the delta. To do that, you have 13 cards which variously allow you to place stones on the islands in the delta, lay planks from stone to stone across the water and then run your guys across the planks. You pre-program 5 cards (as per Robo Rally) and then reveal and resolve each of the first cards, then each of the second cards, and so on. Added to the mix are Dragon cards which allow you to cancel a selected player's card (which can be devastating to a nice little plan) and cards which allow you to remove a stone or plank (given some restrictions). You get to choose from all 13 cards each turn.

The game is a mix of hosing anyone who looks close to winning, but at the cost of advancing your own race. And you can only play one dragon per turn anyway so the damage you can wreak is limited. But it's a fun kind of hosage rather than vicious as you don't really know if the hosee has programmed an alternate plan to get around it. 30 minutes is about the right length for a light 'damn the consequences, torpedo away' kind of game. I really liked the 3D effect of the planks and stones coming up off the board.

Unlike other program games, this is more fun the more chaos the more players.

A sudo-manual dexterity game which isn't good for many gamers. It is fun and is one of those games that works best if you can determine your opponent's choices and counter or work around them. Humorous situations sometimes come up in the same vein as RoboRally.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This game is pure chaos.  Simultaneous action selection is chaotic enough, but this game features simultaneous action selection with long-term planning, as you have to "program" your moves 5 turns at a time.  To top it off, if you make a play that turns out to be wrong by the time it happens, you have to move your pawn back to the beginning and start all over again.  Oh, and there's also direct player hate, as players can play a card that prevents your action from happening.

This a very nice game to play with the right amount of people. I like the fact that the components give you a real feel of building plank-ways off the ground (water). This game could be an 8 or 9 rating if you are lucky to play it with  four or more people who take the time to look who is about to win and work to stop it, or promise to help stop then bluff and give the advantage to themselves. Great for New-Gamers and works well even as one of those after-dinner party games.

I'm not sure it's a great game, but it was a good laugh in a chaotic RoboRally kind of way.

Sure it's meant to be fun to mess with each other's plan and engineer your winning path, but the luck is simply too enormously, mega huge in this game that it's meaningless to gain any sense of satisfaction out of it. If you want a game with the interaction of this one, the same complexity, less luck and with the social fun then I suggest Manila.

Programming game that can turn quickly and be much shorter than it seems.  The usual elements of second-guessing and double-bluff.  Not bad as far as these things go, but not really my cup of tea either.

RATING: 7
Very enjoyable. A nutshell review is that it is Roborally "light." However, the bridge dyamics offer an interesting twist, and the game doesn't overstay its welcome (at least with 4, the max I've played with so far.) If you like the pre-programmed card mechanic and don't mind a little chaos, give this a shot.

RATING: 2
Similar impression as Walk the plank - both have the problem of just too many different cards, becoming too gamey for their own good (or so I think). Between them I probably like RD better for it's component gimmick and less brown. I like Roborally much better as it's simpler and more vicious.

The visuals of the new edition are cute, I have to try with the open side of the board as well (you can place planks wherever). I thought the cards were hard to read - getting broke on illustration when they could have made the icons more intuitive and bigger (!).

Bought this for my seven-year-old son for Christmas--the rating is his. He loves it, although he did have a little trouble fully understanding how and when to use the dragon cards (so I decided to skip them for now). The game still plays well enough without them, and I'm sure we'll be adding them back in very soon.

Light and fun, easy to teach, with a good balance between a sufficient amount of screwage and control.  Perhaps it runs a little long for what it is, but it is quite a bit of fun throught the game.  As long as it may get, the tension builds substantially to keep all of the players intrigued.  Seems to be best for 6 players.  Update: Got to play this again, seems that I'd been playing with the wrong rule, you can only take one other color besides your own.  That makes this game just the right length.  Awesome.

This game is fun !  A race across a pond at the same time as others and trying to second guess what your opponents are going to do so you don't accidentally get bumped into the water ... while they are stealing your planks and getting in your way.  It is always frustrating and a lot of laughs ... a family classic !

I was surprised how much fun this game was. No dice, no random cards... I like that a lot. Games are a lot of fun when you have 5 or 6 players. I have seen some crazy plank paths with that number of people. If I had any complaints, it would be that its easy to knock the whole kit and kaboodle over when you play a remove a plank card (the planks have a heck of a time staying put on the stones). The good thing is that the components are nice and strong, so they stand up to a lot of wear and tear.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great job on this remake.  I never played the original but the component upgrade on this doesn't give me a reason to.  The game is clever and fun, but is not outstandingly-different enough to make me want to own it or replace other games with it.  Would happily play again, though.

Robo Rally-lite, with bridges.  I do like it, but if I'm in that sort of mood, I'd just as soon bust out Robo Rally (after all, I did shell out for all those expansion packs) and race the evening (and the following morning) away.

A bit of a physical element to this game, as the location of stones and length of bridges  plays into it.  The programming aspect makes for some fun planning, and the unpredictability of your opponents makes for fun surprises to watch your turn unfold.  I might need to bump this one up.

RATING: 7
River Dragons edition. 

This is probably the best edition to own. The game has absolutely adorable components and the reverse side of the board now features a blank river, which allows for more chaos as players have to estimate the distance to place their stones.

RATING: 5
Feels too abstract for my tastes, though the simultaneous reveals are fun, often groan inducing moments.  Not sure I care for the take-that element in a multiplayer abstract and the control over your own destiny is limited and a bit too luck based.

RATING: 4.5
Simple RoboRally-ish game where players try to cross to the other side of a pond. Each round you program five cards to perform actions like "place a stone", "place a plank" (spanning between two stones or a stone and your starting/ending island), "jump another player's piece", "remove a stone or plank", etc. Perhaps the most vicious of these are the dragon cards, one for each other player: play a dragon and that player's card in that slot has no effect.

I like programmed movement games, but this one is a chaotic mess, and the dragon tiles encourage picking on the leader such that the winner will probably be one who sneaks in unnoticed. I have some interest in trying it with two players -- it seems like that could be a delicate little dance.

The Matagot "River Dragons" edition has really gorgeous components, including painted pawns and cards with different illustrations depending on the pawn gender. Super cute.

Note: Played the 2012 edition on the board with no mini islands.

Chaotic and fun, where you're mostly hoping for the best until the last round or two at which point you're trying to guess which turn people will be winning and trying to block them with the matching dragon. Not a deep strategy game by any means and though I'd question whether it works with odd numbers, with 4 or 6 it's great fun.

Update: I don't think it works as well with odd numbers, but is still a fun experience.

NEW COMMENT:  We played again!  Honestly, what's wrong with you people.  Why is this so poorly rated.  The tension, fun, bluffing and double-guessing is straight out of The Princess Bride's scene with Vizzini.

OLD COMMENT:  Holy cow why is this game so "poorly" rated.  This must be one of the truly underrated games on BGG.  I traded for it last year.  My wife and I were so tense playing it.  It's just great.  If you get a chance to get it... get it..

And again, I say, this is a great game.  Simple, but with great tension and sometimes laughter even... Glad there's a reprint.

Chaotic but light fare, Dragon Delta is best with many people. The theme, bits and board are nice, but don't expect to have a ton of control over what happens. Over the years, this has dropped from a 7 to a 5 in my ratings, and is being booted from the collection. Dragon Delta may be best suited to family play ... it no longer seems to appeal to the gamers I've played it with.

Even though I wanted to like this game (as it looks very interesting during play), it definitely failed to impress me during my first game. It is so incredibly light that it lacks a sense of control, and almost feels completely luck-driven. If you are in the mood to accept that, you are better of playing other games of this genre like Piranha Pedro or Diamant. Those games are at least FUN to play!Might try again, but not without some rule-tweaks (like having dragons cancel each other based on player order).

Another somewhat unique game in my collection given the game play mechanics. There is a dexterity as well as spatial organization aspect to this game. Being able to visualize the length of the planks required between to stones is not always clear cut. Plus, the set up during game play is quite unique with the different planks running all over the board. It is indeed a sight to behold unlike the regular cube pushing Euros. However, with these type of simultaneous action selection games ala Roborally, chaos reigns supreme during game play. This is clearly not a strategy laden game, but a light diversion with accidental outcomes, missed opportunities and loads of gleeful and vengeful laughter. This game has a place in my collection.

This definitely plays better with more players, but is still a great bluffing game for 2. The increase in player count precipitates an absolute clusterf*** from pretty much the second round and the game immediately shines. There's such wonderful tension in this once the centre of the board is well populated and players try to out bluff one another. A player can only ever block one other player and only once, so double (redundant) blocks are common, as well as players sneaking through unchecked!

The 'one winner and no score' dynamic is worth mentioning because one person succeeds and everyone else loses together, meaning there's no real scale for how much someone won or lost. The truth is anyone can win and at some point, a player is going to get to their destination un-checked.

Fantastic high quality components too, a great tactile game.

Too fiddly and too chaotic for my taste.  Falls prey to the "gang up on the perceived leader" syndrome.  Certain actions become completely inconsequential (specifically the stone laying cards) towards the mid and late game.  I also believe this suffers from a too simplistic way of determining the turn order.  Overall just not a very interesting experience.

RATING: 7
Each player has the goal to cross the river and get to his hut on the other side of that river. To accomplish that, he plays 5 cards blindly. Then all the players simultaneously reveal the first card, and do what the card says. With these cards, a player can place 1 or 2 stones, place 1 or 2 planks, walk 1 or 2 steps, jump over another player, remove a plank or a stone, or play a dragon card. The dragon card, stops the player which color the dragon has (the yellow dragon, blocks the yellow player), the fulfill his card this turn.

The components of the game (2012 version) are great. Fun to play with kids, and could be nice to introduce to new players.

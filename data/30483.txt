RATING: 2
Great bits of course, themed very well and as you can imagine with a subject of this nature the jokes are numerous and clichéd, almost to the point that the Stag could easily have been a new character in Viz. However, this provided most of the fun and while the humour may get monotonous and fade after a while, unfortunately the core game is still there. Which is to say that I didn’t really find it enjoyable. The moves seemed fairly obvious and bar the odd brief stag fight none of it was particularly exciting. Just move round the board making sure you had enough energy to strut your stuff and hope that the food and Does came out at the right spot for you to take advantage of it
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The theme is funny, but the game itself is pretty weaksauce.  not a lot of strategy, just being in a space that gets stocked with food/does is the easiest way to win.  3 players will be particularly rough, since there will be a tendency to beat up on one player to earn the battle defeat cubes.  Mediocre at best game.

RATING: 6
A very enjoyable game where you get to employ terrible innuendo. Actually, I found the things coming out of my mouth a bit worrying... "I'm gonna stroll over here and have my way with this doe." I have only played the basic game, which I found to be very enjoyable. It had some of the fun customization and special powers that are present in Evo, but the game didn't drag the way that one has for me. I think this game is fantastic, and I'll be very happy when I find myself a copy.

RATING: 5.5
I found this disappointing.  It seems like there is a great game trying to get out, but it just doesn't quite manage it.  In a way, it could have been a bit like Pirate's Cove for Stags - move around the board getting what you want, avoiding and fighting, having lots of choices for about 12 turns...great theme.  It falls short of that.  Having said that, I've only played it once, so I may react better to it next time.


The game would benefit from slightly more engaging combat.  OK, so you only need to win one fight or get someone else to retreat, but even so an extra fight here and there would make things more interesting.  Our group suggests one of these would work:

1. Have some random, non-moving, stags that you can fight.  These would appear at various times and be worth a hidden strength value (this is a bit like the LPs in Pirate's Cove)
2. Have a rule that you have a chance of failing to evade on the bottom level of land.  Roll the die.  If it's your colour, you fail to evade.  Middle row you always evade, top row you can never evade.
3. Have some power chits (in addition to food tokens) for each player at the start.  When these are gone they're gone, but you can use them in combat until then.

I realise that this is supposed to be a light game, but even so the combat could be more interesting.  Pick one of these suggestions and it might help.  I would raise my rating if one of them was used.

The bits are of course, wonderful and I also like the mechanism by which the does move up at the end of each round.  That makes it harder to chase them and food at the same time.

A solid show for the Lamont brothers.  The game is lighter than Shear Panic, but has a similar tactical (vs strategic) feel to the game play.  Players need to keep an eye on the competition and know (i.e. guess) when to make a move for a particular action (food, antlers, or rut).  the antler growth mechanic is interesting but I'm not sure if the cost in resources or time to grow a dominate rack helps a player's position enough.  Careful manuevering seems to be the key.  For a lighter game, the play length runs a smidgeon too long but not so much as to drag.  Likely plays best with 4.

The components are the only redeeming feature of this game. There is luck, randomness and a runaway leader problem along with uninteresting gameplay. I purchased this game to try to complete my Fragor Brother's collection, but was underwhelmed by it.

Due to the theme, it will probably play well with a certain group of people, but the joke gets stale after a few accounts.

Rating based on one four-player game.  Like all Fragor games, it's gorgeous and adorable.  Liked it more than I expected based on comments.  On the medium-light side, but plenty of opportunities for tactics and even more for juvenile humor.  As an added bonus, since Bob was the first one to play +1 Rut, using this chit is now known as "pulling a Bob."

A very interesting programming game.  Players set up the actions and order of actions they want to undertake in a a turn and then in order, perform them in an attempt to rut the most does.  The game can play very quickly, if a Stag manages to get some larger horns pr win a fight early on it is probably most useful for them to rut like crazy.

A very amusing game, that is fun to play and a pleasure to play with due to the absolutely gorgeous components.  I like this game, although the actions and order of actions system is initially daunting to new gamers, the game itself is simple enough to serve well as a gateway game - as long as the theme isn't an issue ;)

Antler Island is a simple programmed actions game with the cute components that we have come to expect from Fragor. Here the goal is simple: crazy elk sex. Each round, you execute 4 actions which consist of move, munch, grow your horns, mate. These are all programmed, with 1-3 and X being used, everyone then executes 1, 2, 3, &c. The X can be used at any time, and then you must continue with the sequence.

There are a couple of other things, i.e.: the does moving uphill, and the way you have to win a fight with another player at some point (using your grown horns and unused food counters) to win the game, but that is essentially it.

The game is fast playing and inoffensive, but there is nothing here that is particularly remarkable either. I am not a big fan of the genre in general though, so I might not be the best person to evaluate this game fairly. If you don't mind explaining the aforementioned crazy elk sex to your kids, this would probably make a fine family game though.

The stags are so cool.  Well the first play of this game we played not finding the rule that if you retreat the other player gets the "win a fight token."  That really solves my main problem with the game.  I think this would be a little better with 4 players and we forgot to heckler the stags that retreated ;)

I quite like the game. It's easy to learn, has a programmed action element with a little bit of flexibility (one of your actions can be out of turn) and feels to me a little heavier than a filler but still pretty light. There are several of the cute ceramic bits that Fragor is famous for (the stags) and a nice board which you build into several "tiers" to form the mountain.  Way too pricey for me to buy though unfortunately.

Pick up 10 VPs (does) to end the game.  Pick up food tokens to increase combat strength.  A little bit of "king of the mountain" as all the does climb up the hill at the end of the turn.  So eventually you need enough strength to make your way to the top for both the does and the extra end-game VPs for being there.  Not sure how much I like this game.  Pretty neutral on it.  I'd play again.

Oh deer...
...this game is FUN!:p

Admittedly, at first I only bought it for the cute components (and the low price at the flea market), but then we had such a blast playing it, that it's a sure keeper in my collection. Simple rules, a beautiful board, funny deer miniatures and the wacky theme make for a surprisingly good game (with the right people).

P.S. Plays well with two, if both players use two deers each and leave out the extra board which would make the island smaller.

I enjoyed this despite making the odd blunder. At the core, there is a very good game here. The action markers seem a little unbalanced, but it is game of timing and making mistakes can be punishing. The rules could do with a wee bit of simplifying (the Lamonts are lawyers!). The game needs some player aids and screens to hide your decisions before each reveal. Knowing what other players are planning makes a difference. But the game plays very quickly, the end game feels quite good, and the graphics and stags are superb. A definite improvement over Hameln, Antler Island is closer to the finished article and it's good to see how Gordon and Fraser are progressing as designers.

I bought it because the moose are unbelievably attractive.  4 of us played the "family game".  It was repetitive until the end when confrontations started occuring.  I am hoping the "advanced play" is more confrontational or adds more choices. If so, my rating will go up.

If you like the theme youe will enjoy the game because it is a very thematical game. I find it difficult to say if it counts as an strategy-game it has many strategic decisions but there is much luck in it too (where comes new food and new deer - what number has my food-token...). I think it is a fine mix between strategy and luck.
The rules which enforce/encourage fighting between players seem a bit artifical.

I've only had 1 play at this thus far and had a fun time with it. It has wonderful bits and has a unique and funny theme. It's not as heavy of a game as I first thought. I would say it is more of a mid to light weight game. It did have a bit of a repetitive feel to it by game end. I'll have to play it some more before I can say for sure.

**UPDATE** After a few more plays of this game. I still get the repetitive feel at game end, but games are usually quick enough that it doesn't deter the game any. It's still a fun game, that I would pull out to play every now and then. The advanced game rules do make it a lot more fun imo.

Easy to learn, and not too long (first 4 players game in 40 min).Not sure it has a formidable replay value: the situations may not vary a lot from game to game, and thus lead to automatical decisions...Ps: of course the stag figures are very nice... a shame the does are not as cute!

RATING: 4
Harmless but mediocre game of action programming with an odd theme. Most victory points come from mating, but you also gain them according to your final position on the island and must also win at least one fight against another player. Since two players can't occupy the same region and the central one is worth a lot, it seems the game will usually be decided by a final fight in the last round. There is a likely turn-order advantage, as the last player can wait for other players to fight first and weaken themselves.

On the production, the elevated board sections are a nice touch, although completely superfluous. I'm not a fan of the silly look of the resin stags, which contrast too much with the sober wooden does. I would have preferred wooden stags in the player colors and maybe one of the resin miniatures as a starting player marker. Besides, the model is clearly a moose, not the stag shown in the artwork.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Always good production value.  Quick and easy game.  It reminds me a lot of a game from my distant past.  I swear I played something years ago that had the same allocate actions.  Not that I can remember, maybe it's just reminding me of Heroscape activations.  Not that that's a bad thing.

Simple, fun.  May go up to a 7 after repeated play.

Really attractive looking game with nice bits and lots of character. In many ways the game aptly evokes the rutting season for stags, sadly this doesn't make for a particularly challenging game. The designers were keen to suggest it was still a gamer's game. Playing it didn't back up that view, victory is 90% luck and 10% planning. I still almost bought the game for the sheer beauty and fluffiness of it.

The only reason I could recommend anyone to buy a game like this would be if the theme and bits appeal to you. The strategic/tactical aspect and ruleset (which is all that really matters to me) is poorly designed in my opinion. The design virtually guarantees a runaway leader or loser. The chaos that can result from interaction in a preprogrammed game also does not appeal to me. This game is so primitive that I am amazed that there are people who would want to play it more than a few times.

One of the oddest premises for a game. Despite that, it works very well with the theme, and the game actually has very smooth gameplay. I also enjoy the mix of resin player tokens (which are apparently very obese and deranged bucks) and wood pieces (hehe, "Doeples"). 

I did feel that the game went a little shorter than I thought it would have. Perhaps it was because we had 4 new players and might not have had everything right. But it seemed that we spent too much time doing out own thing (eating, rutting)and not enough combat. Perhaps the board is too large for four people, and we should have played with the 3-player board. There also seemed to be too many does out at any time. My favorite part, growing antlers, left me feeling a little flat, since they are only used for fighting. In my mind, each antler should be worth one point toward the end of the game. The winning player ended up being the one with the shortest antlers.

I frankly found the basic game boring with really very little choices or strategy.  Perhaps the advanced game is better?  Basically, place yourself in a good location to mate with as many doeoples as possible, win one battle (preferably early when people may tend to retreat) and eat some food to grow some antlers.  As always, the production of the elk/moose is above reproach and beautifully done.

I found out too late that food is a critical resource.  It appears in a subset of areas randomly, and the values are also random.  This, to me, makes for a miserable game.  

Coupled, no pun intended, with the fact that players have to beat up on at least one other player to win, if one player gets into a bad position, strength/food wise, there is a great incentive for all the other players to beat up on that player too.

Most fun of the game was the filthy banter about screwing the does.  The look is pretty good but quite modest as far as Fragor goes.  Very simple rules but this leads to rather obvious actions for the most part.  Pleasant enough game if you can take all the puns and sex references.  Not one I need to add to the collection but just fine playing again.

Goofy game with the appropriate heaviness, length, and level of detail for the theme. Here's my strategy advice: a little Axe drives the ladies crazy. Surround yourself with doeples, then get gratuitously attacked at the end to secure the win.

Fun, but not enough game to actually pay money for. Especially that kind of money.

Ambientazione e tematica simpatiche e originali. In questo family game bisogna pensare solo a soddisfare gli istinti primordiali: mangiare e ciula...   Può capitare che per far questo bisogna lottare contro i nostri simili a suon di cornate! Un gioco buffo anche se un po' ripetitivo e fortunoso.

RATING: 4
The first 5 or so turns play almost identically to each other. Move, rut, move, eat, etc.... After a few turns, a little more variety ensues, though I'm not sure it's enough to warrant this being classed as "good". Will maybe try again with the "advacned fighting" variant.

RATING: 7
Cute stags and a 3d board representing a hill on the island. The does climb to the top, so get your stag up there for the easiest rutting, but make sure that you have enough food and antlers to fight off the competition. Interesting combination of mechanics that fit the theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
A good game! This game has all the components to have a great time and with a bit of tongue in cheek humor and comments to boot! Although, I'm not sure about this one yet! It does seem as if you are roaming back and forth across an island eating and mating...trying to rut at the right moments so you can win! Not seeing a lot of plays with us yet...but we shall see!

Fun, light game with excellent components. Went down extremely well with a couple of very reluctant gamers in the family.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A simple game with a fun theme, with a great Stag component that helps bring it to life. You program in your 4 actions each turn - move, eat, rut, grow - and take turns executing them one at a time, meaning turns are fast. Your mission is to move to spaces with does and hook up, scoring each time, whoever hooks up most wins. But you can't win the game unless you win a fight, so you have to spend actions acquiring food and growing antlers to give you the oomph to win a fight (a fight auto-happens when you move into a space containing another Stag). Biggest antlers should also net you three bonus does at the end of the game when you control the centre of the island, so it's not insignificant. But if you spend too much time growing, then someone who did just enough to sneak a fight-win (using disposable food) and then bonks merrily away asap can sneak the win. So there's a balancing act in place. There's significant luck in whether food and does appear in your space or not, and whether those foods are 1s vs 3s. Good luck here can save you many actions, so the game can't be taken too seriously. But that's nicely in keeping with the theme and components, so it's a nice mesh.

Update:  Much better with the correct rules.  Fine lightish family game.  Traded.

Update:  Per Gordon, had a rule quite wrong.  One only needs to have a stag retreat in order to get a winning stag token!  Will try again, but should be a big improvement....

Cute and very nice bits, but not enamoured of the need to win a fight to win.  Admiral Fisher's suggestions in his comments look interesting, such as the chance of not being able to evade.

Very nice bits in a ahort, fun, and easy game. Loser of the first fight might become the target for everyone else, so be wary. Also, be sure to not box yourself in with actions you might not really want to take. In addition, the luck of the food draws might just have a more dominant effect that would be desireable in a longer more 'serious' game.

The mechanics of the game are pretty solid and allow for neck and neck competition until the very end, however the best part of this game is the tongue in cheek conversation that revolves around the theme of the game. Best with a drink and a few adult friends with a good humor.

Flows better and has more replay value than than Shear Panic. Play sessions in this game tend to be spirited and fun; Shear Panic plays a little more clinically.

There is no two-player variant, so you have to make up your own. We play two-player by giving two cards to each player.

In our house, we've altered the combat rules by adding a 1d4 (four sided die) roll to the combat modifiers.

RATING: 7.5
Not a bad game, if only for the hilarious theme. Players were laughing even during rules explanation. Then we were all dirty-minded players. There was much musing on how to teach the game to kids and we check the box: Ages 10 and up.

Players program 4 actions for their stag each turn. They can move, eat (collect food tokens), rut or grow antlers. If they enter a space with another stag, a fight occurs. Players can retreat. If fight happens, the values of antlers and committed food tokens are added up. Highest number wins.

Game end triggers when a stag ruts the 10th doe (4player) or 12th doe (3player). 1VP awarded for each doe rutted, 3VPs for ending game on center space and 1VP for ending on middle tier.

Some luck elements lead to frustration: where the food tokens and does appear at the start of each round for example. Also, it might be a good idea to lose a fight early and go under the radar instead of trying to avoid fights.

Has the best graphics of all Fragor games to date.

Selected quote from our game: 'Go down on a doe!'

I really wanted to like this one.  The theme is great and I liked the idea of a Euro that has you going head to head with everyone.  It seemed tight, with a lot of fun chrome.  Then when you start playing this, you see that the game creates irritating and lucky hot spots for some and nothing for others, lucky tile draws, and a rather aggravating combat system.  While it certainly won't always be the case, this game has the serious potential for run away leaders.  Often times an aggressive Buck will be so far in the lead that despite the hidden values players know that they will lose and will retreat giving a leader an even greater lead.  Once a player gets farther ahead they can't be stopped.  It is cool that it simulates the Alpha Male well, but I'm not sure how great it makes for a game.  Perhaps if the winner of the fight lost an antler instead of the loser the game would be more balanced and engaging.  The most frustrating part of the game is that it is pre-programmed so if you are forced to retreat, it often means you lose the rest of your moves, pushing you even farther behind.

Isn't gaming technology beyond a rich get richer/poor get poorer design schema yet?  I guess not.

Excellent family-style game with some great theme.  You can play the game with both kids and adults, but chances are what comes out of your mouth will be quite different in both games!  Rules and layout are intuitive and very easy to understand and have fun with.  Great production!  *Update* - Now that I've played three times I realize that the first half of the game is really quite pointless.  Things only get interesting when you're getting close to the end and trying to figure out how to stop the leader from winning.  So I would say it's good for a few laughs and at this point it's probably ready to trot away to find someone else to rut!

First, let me say that I'm not the target market for Fragor games.  I'm not really influenced by the cuteness factor of the game and I am just as happy with a beautiful abstract game as a themed one.  So for me, the most important thing that I can say about this game is that I'd be happy to play it even if it came with plain wooden cubes or cardboard chits.  It's a very nice family game with clear rules and straightforward game play.  That said, this game is freakin adorable.  We had dozens of onlookers who couldn't stop oohing and ahhing over the stags, the does, and (my favorite) the stag's antlers displayed on your player mat.  There is a bit of that secret and simultaneous thing going on that I'm not so fond of, but it's not excessive.  There is also a conflict element that might scare away some casual gamers--you can't win the game unless your stag wins at least one fight with another player's stag--but these encounters are few and really not very disruptive to the loser's overall game plans.

This seemed to end a little too quickly; so that the only viable strategy seemed to be to try and mate as quickly as possible and as many times as possible and hope to grab a quick victory over a weaker opponent. With more turns, other options would perhaps be more viable. The 'roar' tile also seemed to be massively more useful than the others.

I'd like to play again with the advanced combat rules.

As with all Lamont Bros./Frajor Games titles, Antler Island has wonderful conponents. The ceramic stags are just right for the theme, the doeples are cool and the multilevel island game board is very nifty. Unfortunately, like Shear Madness, the gameplay doesn't shine as brightly as the bits. The game isn't bad, but player options can be limited. And the luck is all-important. In the last game I played, I drew only one "3" food tile, which pretty much meant I was going to lose every fight. On the plus side, it's quick and, other than the theme (which surprisingly didn't seem to amuse any of the folks I've played with and turned a few off), is a decent family-style game. However, I'm looking for a bit more substance to go with my cool components.

I played this at Essen 07 and enjoyed the experience.  Then I thought back "Why did I like it so much?" - then I remembered that it was the central planning mechanism that brought the interest, tension and interaction ; you had to plan your moves (whether to eat, rut, move or grow your antlers) and the spreading out of these actions by each player kept everyone in the game.  The out-of-sequence X tile added a nice twist.  I may change my rating after a few more games and can then better judge how it is overall, but I certainly want to play it again and hopefully own a copy.  Very good vibes from this one just from a single play :)

One of the "solid 7" games from the Essen 2007 releases.  I like the bits Fragor puts in their games and this one is no exception.  The goofy looking deer are very well done.

I found this game quite charming. The lovely artwork, 3-D board, 'doeples', cute clay stags and customizable antler mats all enhanced the charm and evocation of the theme. Those interested in making educational games should take note of this one. While I don't think it was the intent of this game design, not much would need to be added to bring out an educational component for this. (Food and special ability chits could become cards with information blurbs and so on.)

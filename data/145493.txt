After several plays, I'm prepared to acknowledge this game's awesomeness.  The myriad factors are all well-balanced and game play has an admirable blend of strategy and luck.  There's a lot that can happen in each game, with just enough of it under your control that you're in charge of winning (or at least how bad you lose).

The components are all well made and, despite some of the complaints I've read about the 3D Tower pieces, we really enjoy the the visual element they add to the game board.

The best part of the game is that my kids, including teenagers that are generally hard to pull back into family activities, all ask to play.  That alone was worth the game's asking price.

I would put this game very close to the top of my positive Kickstarter experiences.

kickstarted.
game components and game itself are phenomenal from my perspective. i love tower defense games(video...and now board). game is very difficult as the hero dice hate me while the monster dice sometimes i feel like it's weighted to 20(or i just roll poorly-imagine that?!?).
the game is very long when you first start learning the game and even though you can play shorter games you will want the grand epic experience. if i could only reduce this game by 1hr and have a full 5wave game in 2hrs i feel that it would be much more receptive from my wife and others in my game group 
with all the moving pieces and stacks of health for each monster, the game can feel a bit fiddly which made it less enjoyable for my friend.
while i love this game, it's not something i'll be able to bring out every game night

As I stated in my video review on the YouTube Channel: The Castle Kon, my rating for The King's Armory is "as close to a 10 as you can get."  

In reference to game mechanics, it is a true tower defense style board game that is both challenging and easy depending on many different factors you as the player can choose from.  From the amount of waves/length of the game you want to play, to how you set up your map (modular, can change every single game), you can create a quick easy game to teach new players and children or one of the hardest challenges of your life.

The characters/monsters are extremely balanced.  Whether you are playing solo or with seven players, the game scales with you so it is not impossible to win solo and not ridiculously easy with seven players.  The heroes are superb.  They all are unique and have completely different abilities.  

You can NEVER get bored with this game.  You literally have thousands of different board choices you can make.  You can play a five or seven wave game.  You have seven heroes in the base game to choose from and seven more in the expansion.  There are so many monsters that you rarely pull similar monsters in order. 

There is not a terrible amount of luck in this game.  Like all games with dice, you do have rolls to make, but you have to do the statistics to know what you should do with what monster you are attacking.

There are so many different stats for each hero/monster and tons of choices to make in game.

The artwork is superb.  There is a small level of tongue-in-cheek art in the game which keeps it fresh, but it isn't cartoony or satirical like Munchkin.  I like Munchkin, but I prefer "serious" art.  The components of the game are high quality and to the level of one of the big publishers.  The miniatures are gorgeous and sexy (no I am not just saying that because my wife is a character in the game :p). 

The only reason I cannot give it a '10' is because I truly do not believe there is such thing as a "perfect game."  There is a learning curve with this game and it can be intimidating for new gamers, especially in a crowd.  But there is a learning curve with all games.  In addition, this is a co-op game, which I love, but on the other edge of that sword, all co-op games run the risk of a dictator player taking over.  In general, all the "negatives" of the game are negatives only because they are direct results of all the things that make this game amazing.  This game is the highest rated game in my 80+ game collection.  By far my favorite tabletop game.  

Overall, the only way you could be disappointed with the game is if you do not buy it!

Stuff I didn't like: 
3d towers - look cool, but get in the way so you can't see the board and self destruct, a 2d counter would be much better (we just used 10 hit point counters in the end)

numbers over symbols in tiny point size, pretty much unreadable - hopeless in low light

long and grindy - yes I suppose it fits the 'theme' but I'd want a quick game with interesting decisions, there wasn't enough here for me for the length, I got bored.

fiddly - ugh, hit points as big counters of different sizes was just irritating, I'd rather either have just a stack of hp all worth the same, take 3 hits remove 3 (so the pile gets smaller) or double sided, take a hit, flip it, take another remove it rather than making change. Or better some dial system (like heroclix) where you dial down as damage is inflicted.

Rule book - bit of a convoluted mess, spent a bit of time finding what 3+3 on a monsters damage meant (for example)

But mostly I found it all a bit dull and too much die roll +/- mods. 

Overall, I could see some people loving it, but it isn't for me, I'd play it again if pressed but really I can't see why you'd play this over a tower defence game on a PC/mobile ... long, fiddly and some of the graphic design choices were a bit strange.

RATING: 7
All in all I enjoy playing The King's Armory, but I don't take it out often. For me, it is best as a solitaire game. The game is actually pretty simple, but the rules are written in a convoluted manor, so it took a few plays to get it. At the heart of the game, you have to plan where you put your towers and heroes/hirables to stop the monsters who move and act in a predictable way. So, there is a lot of strategy there, which I like. I find that the game is too long for group play and the strategic aspect works better solitaire than in a group.

Kickstarter edition with pewter miniatures

I had really high expectations...


...and all of them were met.
This game truly feels like a Tower Defense.

After you learned what stands where and for what it offers really streamlined gameplay with a lot to plan and think about it.

A lot what has been done wrong by other TD-games is done right by King's Armory.
The difficulty is high enough to keep the players involved, the variability is immense...
Another thing, that I really like, is the high momentum of the game. Everything you do is not enough, everywhere you are is the wrong place at the wrong time. It truly feels like a struggle.

This game is super cool.



But every coin has two sides:
-I found the character "boards" to be really thin cardboard that might be damaged easily if handled or packed (while shipping) the wrong way.

-The border-connections seem a bit fragile. A shape like in the FFG-games is a lot sturdier and would have been better.

-The use of hitpoint-counter-stacks is a bit bulky. The initial idea of the first Kickstarter attempt with spinning dials would be much better. But costs need to be reduced...

-The artwork is not really my style but it's ohkay.

-Without the minis it looks quite ... not dull ... but pretty unspectacular. The effect you get with the towers get's lost with the lack of minis.

-I'm quite unhappy with the towers:
---The assembly is a bit flimsy but you have to do it only once
---You can't store the towers in the box once you've built them
---If you want to store them inside the box and disassemble them after the Play then the paper used for the Towers will be too thin to handle repeated use. Something sturdier would be better...or a 2D-counter-alternative or something like a pedestal that is just a cm high.


Sounds like much but all these are just optical and don't affect the gameplay (and the counter-stacks are manageable).
I really really love this game and I am totally happy that I bought this one (with the minis).

Kickstarter with high hopes for it, but my oh my what a dicefest. Multiple abilities, but if you fail your single roll, the best ability is for naught, thus proper gameplay and calculation of propabilities demands use of only the standard abilities (which are cheaper).
And seemingly endless long.

Boring. Waited more than a year, sold after only 3 plays. Big letdown.

Currently my favorite board game.  It is well balanced and has tons of replay value.  I really like the games ability to allow people to come in and out of game play without disrupting the game.

The first Tower Defense Game I have played off of my computer.  Lots of fun, and a good couple of different strategies to use, especially with the different hero combinations.

Played the Print and Play during the Kickstarter. Really fun tower defense boardgame. Puts Castle Panic into a kiddie category and my family loves Castle Panic. So many more choices and vastly different gameplay. Replay value looks to be very high based on alternate layouts, starting champions, who you hire or upgrade, what to buy with your treasure, and many more. I think it will only get better with time.

I bought the deluxe edition of The King's Armory at a game convention in Los Angeles because the hook line "tower defense board game" sounded great. The creator Jon Wrot seemed earnest and excited, so I claimed it immediately and without hesitation.

$100+ later: I feel a little foolish. 

The game is made of unquestionably high quality materials and while some of the artwork has a definite "beta edition" feel to it, the overall physical quality of this game is superb.

That said, and bearing in mind that I am an experienced gamer with many years of proficiency in a wide array of complex RPG and board game systems, this game is a bitch to learn.

My friends and I spent a solid 4 hours to set up and learn the game and get through the first wave of our first attempt. That's okay for a first run, and it definitely speeds up once you know what you're doing. But while you can gain proficiency and reduce the time it takes to work through the machinations of the game, you can't really reduce the *amount* of work, and as a consequence, the work-to-fun ratio of this game is - for me - very very high.

It often felt like I was doing all the tedious parts of combat in many RPG systems, with very little of the interesting strategic and tactical decisions that make those combat systems enjoyable.

The only conclusion I can come to after playing this extraordinarily involved board game implementation of the tower defense mechanic is that that is a damn good reason that mechanic became popular after the advent of personal computing.

Note: An astute reader will observe that most people who review this game disagree with me and think that this game is totally the shit! So obviously we're different kinds of people and you may well agree more with them than me – I would just warn everyone to play-before-you-buy.

King's Armory is a great game. I really wanted to give it an 8 rating, but had to go to 7 because of the length of time it takes to play and the length of prep between the latter waves. But, even with the length of time, I still really enjoy the style, theme and play of the game quite a bit.

A tower defence board game that is done right for the gamers. It is brutal but fair. Tons of variability in tactics and choices easily puts this game into one of the best.

I really liked the idea of a tower defense board game, as I really like the genre (on my PC/tablet/smartphone).
I backed this on KS and was excited! After my first play I just have to say: Yes, it's a good port of "Tower Defense games" (even if it is no real Tower Defense game IMHO, as the towers do nothing other than host the heroes and hirelings which kill the invaders). But it is too luck dependend, as you roll for just everything. And on top of this the game suffers from the alpha player problem.
I doubt that I will ever play this with my gaming group....

Great game!  Loads of replayability, great variation in each game.  Top 3 co op for our gaming group.

The best part for us is the "drop in or out" feature.  This makes it a great game for a group which sometimes needs to change players in or out due to timing constraints.

I've played the game at all of its stages of development.  And I really liked it every time.  The way it has evolved into the fine tuned and easy to play machine that it now is was really cool to watch.  Most importantly,  I know when I see something that works and is fun and gets me immersed waiting for the next round or turn or game or what have you.  And this did that for me.

My favorite character was either Valcor or Cyrus, they are upfront pro-active characters.  The interaction between the players and the way they work together given their character's abilities is fun to play out.  You also never need to worry about 'being without'.  If you play Melee Heroes, you hire supernatural and ranged recruits; and vice-versa; and then you get to play them also, so by end-game each player has 2 or 3 characters they can control.  I'd say the addition of the Equipment cards to further balance the Heroes, and make it feel like they're leveling up took it to a whole new level.

The devs are really sincere people. It's always a pleasure to play games with them.  I supported them and the game on KS rnd 1, and will whenever they get the relaunch up.  
Great game, I really hope it gets made.  For the quality of the game, and all their hard work, I think they deserve it

This is a typical Amerithrash game of chucking dice and missing a lot, but focused on killing a mass of enemies in multiple waves of increasing numbers of increasingly difficult monsters. Toward the end of the game, you really get the feeling of chipping away at a juggernaut (and usually fail at it).

The standard game lasts 4+ hours, where setup + waves 1-3 constitute the first two hours and about an hour each wave for waves 4 & 5. This and the sheer number of enemies that have to be processed each turn comprise one of my two main complaints. People get fatigued and tired of trying to compare small numbers to So. Many. Dice rolls.

My second main complaint is the sheer amount of luck necessary to win this game. You can do just about everything perfectly and will still lose at least half the time. To some, that presents a fun challenge, but it isn't very appealing to me to lose after 4 hours of trying my hardest. A shorter game time would be better if you're expecting your players to fail.

Otherwise, this game has an interesting mix of choices and abilities that really shine with 3 or 4 heroes. Fewer and you don't get enough oomph. More and the game is /even longer/ (5+ hours, easy). There is a mechanism for jumping in and dropping out, mid-game, and that works okay, but in practice, we just assigned the hero of a leaving player to another player. It is, however, really nice to be able to add the late joiner of a meetup group after a wave, especially since you will be at the table for a *long time* before your game is over.

Hero progression is limited to buying two pieces of equipment at random and power is mainly increased via hiring extra units to man the towers. You really have to get into the mindset of plinking down your enemies though, especially in the later levels when they have tons of hit points and lots of armor. Unfortunatly, reliable effects such as burning and slowing, are in short order, so the tactical strategy mainly boils down to "attack the one that your damage type can hurt the most".

All in all, it is pretty much a game that just takes a long time to play (and *seems* like it takes even longer to play). I envision picking other games over this one just about every time, but I would play it again if anyone else really, really wanted to try it out.

Board game tower defense, just like it says on the tin.

This game wants to be administered by a game master, I suspect, as there are a lot of ways the monsters can interact with the game state on the board turn (computers are really good at this part).

I never did figure out why the gnomes stole all the heroes' gear and offered to sell it back to them as thanks for defending the gates.

But it's fun anyway.

This is a game that does a pretty good job emulating the tower defense style video games. The game involves lots of die rolling for combat, but misses are fairly rare, and the design gives you a cool effect when you land a critical hit. The combat system is very well thought out, with resistances, different types of damage, and a minimum damage dealt, all of which is implemented in an easy to understand way. The game has the option of going 5 rounds or 7 rounds. 7 feels a bit too long to me, but 5 is really fun. 

One of the things I like is the ability to hire followers who act as lesser versions of proper characters. It gives you just a little more to do in a round and gives you a positive sense of building something. The components however are hit and miss. The tiles are great quality and most of the cardboard is nice and thick. The monster tokens are a little small, which can make them hard to read. 

The papercraft towers, while a really cool idea, feel a little flimsy and they can block the visibility of areas of the board. The dice are snazzy, but in some colors make the gold painted numbers hard to read. The game could also use a display card that re-states monster targeting priority and the cost of things to buy in between waves without having to flip to that page in the rulebook each time. The graphic design is pretty clear and the art is good enough, so that helps, but nothing really "pops" (as my art school teachers used to say). 

After a few plays, the game starts to feel samey. While there's an ok variety of monsters, game to game there doesn't feel like there's a lot of variation in your player choices, and the same monsters are the ones to cause you trouble every game.

I expected mindless dice chucking.  My first impression was that the game actually has tactical choices and some strategy in building up a team between waves.  On a second play, I found the game criminally boring -- lots of dice chucking intermixed with occasional tactical choices.

If the combat were less about math + luck and more about choices, then the tactics might start to be interesting.  I also want to just jump to a later wave, make some strategic purchases and spend more time upgrading my defenses (like a tower defense game) and less time executing the defenses (in a dice-driven simulation).

Tested the Kickstarter Print'n'Play version.

The game is easy to learn and real fun. It has a customizable game board and many different hero's with different special skills to choose from. Also there are a lot of ways to buy hirelings, items and one-time abilities to get even stronger and survive the next wave. Even the strategic discussions with coop players are real fun.

These and a very flexible way to fit the rules to the prefered level of game difficulty gives The King's Armory a lot of deep gameplay and replayability.

I love this game.  It does an excellent job of emulating a tower defense video game.  I've had a great time each time I've played.  I love that I can actually play a wave, pack it up neatly and play the next wave somewhere else, even with a different player count.  I love all the upgrades, I love picking different heroes each time and I love puzzling out a decent strategy with each assortment of baddies.  

I have some nitpicks.  I don't feel the heroes get enough of a chance to shine.  Maybe a bigger variety of equipment available after each wave might solve this or some leveling system, but in the last wave, they don't feel much more powerful than the level 3 archer or level 3 mage that's next to them.  

The towers ... are just awful.  I would have LOVED to get some cardboard towers that you could put together like the train in colt express and then easily take apart.  You could have probably fit 3 more punch boards into the box with 2 nice towers apiece without adding too much cost to the game.  This was really a missed opportunity.  I've already replaced mine with lego towers that are hinged to come apart and fit nicely in the box after play.  

The art isn't the best, but it's serviceable.  I keep getting the feeling that I'm looking at a decent fantasy person with someone's face photoshoped onto the head.  Some of the heroes are honestly a bit creepy.  

OK, enough of that.  The good news is that this game is just amazingly fun.  I can play it with my 8 and 10 year old boys and have a blast and I can take it to game night and we can all strategize together how best to destroy the invading hoards while taking as little damage as possible.  I'd give this game a solid 9 if it weren't for the nits.

I had the privilege of playing King's Armory this past weekend at GenCon 2014 Indianapolis and I was, and still am, thoroughly impressed with the depth, content and playability.  I have never been much of a tower defense fan but this style in a tabletop game was remarkably easy to pickup and play.  John Wrot stepped outside the box on this game and nailed it!

Neither a great or bad game. I was interested in the beginning, but I've watched enough game play and review videos to know that this isn't the game for me or my group of gaming friends.

Tower Defence boardgame, now why don't we have more of these. Plus I'm always a fan of non competitive, Strictly co-op games.

good idea and Great Artwork! Needed more play testing! Would love a 2nd edition! Streamline the picking of monsters for each wave! Streamline the Monsters hit points, damage and turns! Maybe use the rotating mechanic of Castle Panic on Monster tiles!

A friend brought it over and we played it.  I immediately bought my own copy, and the game has quickly launched to the top of our favorite games lists.  We actually fear it's ruining other games for us...

This was the first game I backed on Kickstarter.  I played a print-and-play a few times and I did really like it.  I like the progression of the game, and the tower defense game play is done very well. 

The instruction book is very poor.  However, it is not a deal breaker.  The art in the game is very jumbled and mismatched.  It is obvious that many different artists made contributions.  A lot of the component quality is also fairly poor, which is a little surprising given that several stretch goals were unlocked that increased component quality.  The game can get a little fiddly... there is a lot of managing of tokens and checking charts-although that type of thing doesn't bother me much.  But even with all that said, I do believe this is a very good game and worth looking into, especially if you enjoy co-ops or classic tower defense style video games.

I've played League of Legends so long now that defending towers is my second nature, and this game allows to do this in the beloved board game setting!

The game is fun but sometimes you get those monsters you just can't kill for one reason or another. Like that little fairy dragon thing. moves 12 per turn and immune to everything but magic. Good luck trying to kill those if you get 2 on the same round.

I have played the PnP version of this game - this is awesome. This actually feels like a real tower defense game.

I cut up one or two of the paper towers because folding them and unfolding them was literally impossible while keeping them intact.

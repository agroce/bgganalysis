GAME: Keltis: Der Weg der Steine Mitbringspiel
RANK: 2238
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Super quick, easy, portable and pretty filler with no cruft.

A suitable successor to Lost Cities because the game feels very tense and tactical with 2, but will also play up to 4 if anyone else is around. Highly recommended.

I think this is the best of the Keltis games - I had it signed by Reiner Knizia and he seemed bemused by this opinion....

7 approaching an 8.  Fun, quick, sturdy, small.  Yeah, so it's [b]Lost Cities[/b] meets [b]Coloretto[/b]...big deal.  You get a lot of fun in those 15 minutes.  And the scoring really isn't that bad.  There's so much tension and so much to love in this tiny game!

Update: Upgraded to an 8.  Good stuff...always want to play.  It scratches the itch of this great series in such a short amount of time.

Such a simple concept, but being able to choose higher or lower, and the extras (VPs, extra turns gems on tiles) make this a great quick fun game. FAR better than Lost Cities. I very much prefer playing a different variant where you can add to either end of the path and only take a face up time if it has just been discarded.

I seem to be saying this a lot these days, but this is another good, short filler with simple pieces and simple rules.

Juego de Knkizia, de mecánica similar al exploradores, aunque se juega con fichas y no con cartas. Muy sencillo de transportar. Rápido y con una componente estratégica interesante.

Añade a exploradores una característica que le faltaba. La posibilidad de jugar más de dos jugadores. Le conocí de mano de Rtz y fue un descubrimiento. A gema le gustó.

Nota: Para 2 se parece al exploradores muchísimo.

Lo añadí a mi coleccion tras las CLBSK Abril 2010. Adquirido a Gixmo por 7€

RATING: 8
What an addictive little game.   Not a whole lot to it, but then again, it's nice that not EVERY game is Age of Steam.  Awarded a rare 10 due to its simplicity, bare-bones design, and the fact that Knizia somehow managed to milk yet another game out of the Keltis genre.  That feat alone (getting distributors to handle 6 games that are effectively the same thing) deserves a round of applause. Atta boy, Knizia!

After further plays, dropped from a 9 to an 8.  There really isn't a whole lot of strategy here.  It actually becomes a little repetitive with further plays.   Might even drop further.

Knizia continues to amaze me at how he can take a kernel of an idea and turn it into 4 different games.  This is probably my fave in the Lost Cities family. 
Played it a half dozen times now - fun lightweight game. Can teach to nongamers in 2 minutes - great with 4, even better with 3.  Some tension deciding if you should go for it or not and it plays in 10 minutes (if there aren't any timesucks at the table) which is just perfect for this type of game.

Players take turns flipping up the 55 stone counters that begin face down on the table, and optionally taking the tile or leaving it there.   Alternatively, they can take an already flipped tile.  Claimed tiles are displayed in front of the players, in ascending or descending order of value.  Bonus turns are available if a celtic symbol tile is taken.  Game ends when all tiles are flipped, literally in about 10 minutes.  Points are scored (or lost) for length of tile suits claimed, as well as bonus points for stones and values.  Ultra-lite, portable version of the Keltis boardgame, and to be honest, it feels just like it!  Works well - great travel version of the parent game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Essentially this is a multiplayer Lost Cities variant, distilled down to a 10-minute game.   You are allowed to start at any value in the series and then go either up or down from there without reversing direction.   Some stones give bonus points, an extra turn, or a "blarney stone" which are required to avoid a scoring penalty.   There's not a lot of control and quite a bit less tension than Lost Cities.   I could take it or leave it.

Quite possibly the closest in feel to the original "Lost Cities" card game of the Keltis family.  Though luck plays a large part in this game, you are still forced to make some difficult and strategic choices - just as in the original Lost Cities.  With four players, the game can get brutally mind melting. :)

Kipróbáltuk ketten és négyesben is.
Ketten még volt benne némi taktikázásra lehetőség, bár ott se estem hanyatt a lehetőségektől.
Négyesben viszont valami elképesztően értelmetlen. Tényleg egy ki dob nagyobbat a kockával szintre süllyed a játék. Semmilyen ráhatásod nincs a játékmenetre, teljesen pure luck az egész, súlyosbítva egy jó nagy adag hógolyóhatással. Szóval ha az elején szopóra kerülsz, akkor egyre nagyobb eséllyel húzol rossz lapkákat.
Rettenetes. Nem is értem, hogy a sok klón után ez minek kellett. Ráadásul ott van a coloretto, ami nagyon hasonlít rá, de ég és föld a két a játék.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Der Weg der Steine takes the old and tried approach of Lost Cities and applies it to tile collecting. Which is actually much the same as card collecting, only with tiles. Heh.

Anyway, the basics are pretty much the same except that this implementation gets rid of the hand management and makes the game more random by only having one tile of each number and colour instead of two.

While that doesn't completely rid the game of decisions to make they are quite a bit less interesting than even those of its co-conspirators. A very much unneeded variation.

You have far less control than in the boardgame, since you must immediately decide if you play the tile you just drew; at first, that gives the feeling the game is totally random. But there are actually decisions to make and there is some fun and tension. So if you're looking for a little transportable 10-min filler...

Tovább egyszerűsíti az amúgy sem bonyolult alapjátékot. Nincsenek benne kártyák, csak lapkák 5 színben, 0-tól 10-ig számozva. Az egyes lapkákon vannak feltüntetve
a számok mellett az alapjátékban külön jelölőként szereplő gyűjthető zöld kövek, lóherék, illetve a plusz pontok.

A játék elején minden lapkát képpel lefelé fordítunk. Amikor ránk kerül a sor, felfordítunk egyet, és
lerakjuk magunk elé, elkezdve egy sort. Ugyanúgy csak egy sor lehet egy színből, amiben vagy növekvő,
vagy csökkenő sorrendben rakjuk le a lapkákat. Ha nincs szükségünk a lapkára, akkor azt otthagyom az
asztal közepén felfordítva, amit aztán bárki elvihet, ha rá kerül a sor. Tehát, amikor húzunk egy lapot,
az történhet akár a felfordítottak, akár a képpel lefelé heverők közül is. A lóherés lapkát a sorunkba berakva újból jöhetünk. Ha az utolsó lapkát is felfordítjuk, vége van a játéknak, és következik a pontozás. 
Miután nincsenek a kezünkben lapok, így előre tervezni sem lehet. Ebben a játékvariációban ez által még erőteljesebb a szerencse szerepe. Itt nem tudjuk visszatartani azokat a lapokat a kezünkben,
amelyek nekünk nem, de az ellenfeleinknek jók, így azok rögtön bekerülnek a közösbe, amit azonnal el is vihetnek. Ezért bizony sokszor bevállalunk a sorunkban egy-egy nagyobb ugrást is, csak ne hagyjuk meg nekik azt a jó lapot.

RATING: 6.9
Small box push your luck. You want to collect a lot of a few colors--having a few of a color will penalize you at end game, but having none of a color is no penalty.
The collecting tokens in ascending/descending order makes it so you won't want to automatically take everything you flip over. Anything lying face up on the table is another option for other players, so you might have helped them on your turn.

The kind of annoying thing is there are some tokens with a green gem on them and if you do not collect enough of the green gem tokens, you get minus points. In the 3 player game I played, a green gem never turned up on my turn, and when another player turned over a token with a green gem they took it. So I never had the opportunity to collect any of those which was crippling to my score.
Not a huge deal as this can occur with any game involving flipping cards (er in this case tokens), but totally can be a thing.

Aug09:

Felt different as 2-player.

In particular, I didn't realize how zero-sum it would be with no pieces missing.

I think it would work much better with more players.

I did however really like the 3 extra icons on the stones.  They gave them personality and individualism.  They made the game.


I would almost consider playing it with a "hand size" of 2.  Then just adapt Lost Cities "Play then draw" with still only 1 communal discard pile in the center.


If you come across this one on the cheap, it really isn't a bad little filler.  It's just nothing to write home about either.

Keltis/Lost Cities really boiled down to its minimalistic essence. Reasonably fun (and clever) filler, but that being said, there are so many other light fillers out there to compete for the spot, and there's nothing really that distinguishes this game.

The small size of the game, and the extremely short playing time are big plusses, though. The game captures 90% of the full Keltis/Lost Cities the Boardgame experience, but only takes up a fraction of the space and time. That's good, I suppose...

Really distills Keltis down to the bare minimum, which is a good thing!  I am probably a bit biased in my opinion, as we initially played 5 times in a row and I won all five times (tying the first one).  I could see how some people would find that there's too much luck, but the random tile draw is the same as a random card draw, there's just a reduced hand size.

The reduced play time really makes this superior to Keltis.  I would only choose to play Keltis over this if we were using the expansion.  Many will bemoan Knizia's lack of heavy titles, but he really excels at these little quick games with good tension and a good rules to fun ratio.

[LUP 03-Sep-2009] The board game of the card game of the board game of the card game I think, but I probably lost track along there somewhere.

Clearly derivative of Lost Cities, although it did take DaughterTheElder two weeks to remember the connection :D

Quick little game with three scoring paths and you really need to pay attention to at least two of them since all can give negative points if they are neglected.

Packing up tip.  Place all the tokens face up and when playing the next time [b]quickly[/b] flip the box over and most, if not all, tokens will be face down ready for a quick shuffle and play.

We have found this to be a game the whole family can play (Daughter the Younger is six).

Can a game where you draw a colored numbered stone and choose whether to add it to a path or return it be good? Yes, once again Knizia shows how even the simplest mechanisms can be used to its maximum potential. The choice whether to keep a stone is affected by how much it can score, which in turn determined by the length of the path, its number of bonus points and its value to an opponent. Luck is still important but tactics win in the long run. You cannot find more depth in relation to complexity and time.

RATING: 7.6
Discarding is a key strategic consideration in the Keltis/Lost Cities system, and this light tile drawing variation on the theme pushes the question of when to discard a card to the fore. The game plays very differently with 2, 3 or 4 players, as one is always tempting fate by leaving a tile exposed in the common pool for others to scavenge. One of the very best filler games, it stands on its own alongside its more famous brethren.

Lost Cities-ish game of collecting sets that are nested in other sets.  Fun and straight forward, though going beyond 2 players takes away a lot of the  control that makes Lost Cities great.

---- Preliminary thoughts ----

I wouldn't say it's a bad game, because it works, but it's utterly simple. Almost no strategy (push your luck or not) and simple or evident decisions. 

It's fast and easy to teach, but I don't see people getting in love with it. In fact, I guess it will become very repetitive after some plays. And it only takes up to 4 players.

Definitly, there are much better games on this style.

Mechanics are same from the Keltis - the boardgame but this one is simpler. I like how the games components are all just similar looking cardboard tiles as it's quite elegant. Unfortunately the game is more random than Keltis and isn't quite as good. Works as a short filler.as it only takes 15-20 minutes.

A fun little box - almost a direct cross between Lost Cities and Coloretto. If the cynicism surrounding Dr Knizia's publishing methods prevents great little games like this from coming to the table, I shall be a very unhappy man.

Same rating as all the other Keltis implementations. Essentially the same feel as the card game, but with a simplified base, being turn a tile/card over and either keep it or leave it in a common pool for someone else to pick up. I liked the way that selected tiles could contribute to two different scoring mechanisms, introducing some hard choices on whether to pick up, or some good cheer/groan factor if you lucked into something that fit the suits you were picking up. Very family friendly, easy to teach. Perhaps it's too light and too fluffy in the end, but it's nice to play.

This is light, light, light, and that means one thing: it's actually going to get played. 

Regarding the gamer-y lineage, it's part of the Keltis/Lost Cities family, so the fundamental goal of the game is to sequence things in numerical order. It shares the Keltis way of doing this, which is that you can either start high and descend, or start low and ascend, but not both within the same color. So it's pleasing and simple to grasp because the goal makes sense: select tiles that either go up or down, and you are limited to one row of each color. The selection is simple as well: flip a new tile face-up, then take it or not. Or else don't flip a new tile, instead taking one that's already flipped. 

The scoring is also simplified, and no one has to bother with the Lost Cities way of scoring, with the handshake multipliers and needing to get to 20 before positive points are counted. That's not hard math by any means, but "count your tiles and consult this chart" is faster and easier and doesn't tend to cause people's eyes to glaze over.

The only reason to play this one over the "original" Keltis is because its portability and an even easier set of rules, that makes the game suitable for kids that can count. That being said, this version brings even more luck to a game already full with it, which is not disastrous in a design of this lenght and weight, but it certainly is a factor to take into account. Besides, it doesn't have any tiebreaker rule, which makes the design look a little lazy, cause it is very easy to come out with something.

Keltis: Der Weg der Steine -- 

Played once; three-player.

Nothing wrong with this, but I have no desire to own it.  

Generally I'd rather play [thing=42487]Lost Cities: The Board Game[/thing].  Of course, that's longer, so if you're looking for more of a filler experience, Keltis: Der Weg der Steine may fit the bill.  

If you're looking to scratch that [thing=50]Lost Cities[/thing] itch, and you have more than two players, I suppose Keltis: Der Weg der Steine works, but only if you have just three players.  With four players, I'd much rather play Lost Cities using the partnership variant.

Still, if someone specifically suggests this, I'll play it, and I'll enjoy it.

I own and enjoy Lost Cities the Boardgame and this captures the essence of the original Lost Cities plus some scoring bonuses similar to those in the Boardgame.
What makes this worth owning is a clever mechanism that makes the gameplay similar to playing Lost Cities but with a shared, common hand of cards. 
There is no hidden info which makes for tough decisions.

Would play anytime.

Wonderful. It's true that the game changes wildly depending on the player count e.g. 4 players luck of the draw probably outweighs strategy, but play with just 2 and this little gem becomes a seriously clever tactical battle. The rules are so simple, the box so small, but every game of this has created a fantastic experience so far. This is a shoe-in for my top 50 without question.

Continuing perhaps my best game streak ever, another great game that I haven't played before. One of the most ingenious game designs I've ever seen.  It would be difficult to make a great game based upon a previous design.  The clever idea is already included in the original and you're already locked in to a certain way of thinking.  Knizia did that with Medici vs Strozzi.  Here he does it with Keltis, then makes a great card game version of a board game based upon a card game, with all three being unique and great by themselves?!  AMAZING!  This is a great family game too.  Easy to learn, plays quickly, and offers very interesting choices.  WOW!

Played it for the first time with three, after a hiatus of several weeks. This is actually even more clever than I first realised. There's a lot more tension with three, and the stakes in whether or not picking up a tile definitely increase. So, bumped up my rating.

Nice pick-up version of Keltis. There's no hand management here. Instead, it's all about timing and reading your opponents. How long will they wait out, what's the right time to pick up the open tiles?

Works very well with two, haven't played it yet with more.

[KOSMOS 09 edition] {Celtic; drafting, luck-pressing, set-collection; optimal 4p}  After playing Keltis: Der Weg Der Steine, I really admire Knizia.  He's so talented in designing games; esp. modifying existing mechanics of his existing games to have another playable and fun game.  Keltis: Der Weg Der Steine is probably the most luck-drive game in the series but it's short enough not to be offensive.  Decision is very simple in this game.  I believe 4p is the best way to have a fun play - there are competition about the tiles.

RATING: 7
[thing=41003][/thing] is a light game with its roots in the gameplay of [thing=50][/thing]. Basically, player turn over tiles, and then decided to use it (if possible) or to leave it there, revealed. The first tiles of each color taken has to restriction, but, after the second, the player must choose: take a tile that goes from the number of the first tile up or one that goes down. After this, the player must follow this "direction" - always going up in numbers or down. And, of course, once the player "jumped" a number, it is unavailable. For example:

- first the player takes a Green 1;
- later he reveals a Green 5. She leave it there;
- she sees other players take Green 3 and 4;
- so, once she is up, she takes Green 5;
- later she can't take Green 2 (since she is already at five, and can't go down), nor Green 0, as her Green numbers must always go up (this was decided by the second tile taken).

As you can see, there is a new spin to the base mechanics of [thing=50][/thing]: in [thing=41003][/thing] there is the option to go up and down, not just up.

The scoring is also different: it is based on the number of tiles for each color, not the number - so go up or down is mainly a decisions of availability (in which way there is more chance that you will take more tiles). In this Keltis, a 1 can be worth as much as 9. Of course, like in [thing=50][/thing], you can lose points in colors that you take too few tiles. There is also ways to score accordingly with symbols some tiles have - there are those that give points directly, but the one that appears the most is the wishing stones icon, and to score this well, the player need to have several symbols among her tiles at the end, or she can also lose points, and this is true for everyone: players must take tiles with wishing stones icons, or will be bound to lose points (it isn't like not starting a color, as in here you simply don't lose or gain points; any player with 1 or with no tile with the icon, will lose points). There is no multiplier, the way the sponsoring did.

The game ends when the last face down tile is flipped - the current player finishes her turn and the play is over. The winner will be the player with the most points - yes, there will be the usual tally at the end, but, unlike [thing=50][/thing], is simply a matter of comparing the number of tiles, for each color, to a chart and see how many points is gained or lost. The same for the wishing stone icons. Simpler, and easier to remember, so, while pen and paper are of use, they aren't as required as in [thing=50][/thing].

[thing=41003][/thing] offers an even lighter experience than that o [thing=50][/thing], and that is no small feat. This happens mostly because the decisions are much easier to be made: either take it or leave it. Unlike [thing=50][/thing], in which you have not only to use cards in the expeditions, the player also must retain cards for later and away from the opponent. This isn't easy to be done, as it requires large doses of compromise: sooner or later the players have to let go from cards that will help the other (the thing is to see which will help [i]less[/i]) or the player will have to "jump" in an expedition, going from a 2, 3, 4 to 9. Therefore, in [thing=50][/thing] there is more timming in the gameplay, and the control of the players, even if this wasn't exactly huge to begin with. Mainly because of the 2 players nature of [thing=50][/thing], as the reasoning is simple: if it isn't with you, it is probably with the opponent or still in the deck. And players can be sure that, for every card, they have 50% chance of getting it. [thing=41003][/thing], when playing with 3 or 4, you can't have that level of certainty, and is riskier to go into several expeditions (I call expedition, but in Keltis isn't really one). There isn't, in [thing=41003][/thing], that moment of relief when someone jumps high, or start an expedition, and you now have just gained one or two discards to make.

As expected, the confrontation in [thing=41003][/thing] isn't also as high as in [thing=50][/thing] - the multiplayer nature dilutes the head-to-head effect, still, player will definitely try to screw others as much as possible while gaining points.

The game offers little room for AP, but you can be sure someone will have it while playing, as decisions involve taking risks now or waiting as much as possible to lower it, or, in this push your luck sort of way, lose the tile to someone else. The learning curve is soft, almost flat, and basically anyone can play it at a good level after a few rounds of the first game, definitely in the second play, which usually comes right after the first, as the game leaves some of that "want more" feel.

Overall, playing [thing=41003][/thing] is a light and fun excercize, filled with quick decisions, some risk-taking, a fine slice of push your luck, a level of interaction that, mainly due to how short the game is, doesn't really earn you enemies, in a small package, with easy to teach and to learn rules.

I am just not sure if this game is meant for two players. The rating is certainly based on a two player game. The tension is sorely lacking in a two player game as some stones are clearly designated only for a specific player since the other player cannot play it. So there is really no threat or hurry to pick up the card. To top it off, unless Keltis where the deck runs out and the game ends, the end game doesn't really happen until all the card are flipped. So, it really does kill off a lot of the tension. In addition, it is practically suicide if one doesn't play all five colors. Your opponent would just pick up the 5th color and proceed to run up the score. This game will only work for 2p if both players pick up all five colors and it is contested. Then, it will be more challenging.

Has potential, but seems broken with two players.

I'm apparently not the only one who thinks that the No Thanks/Medici setup rules should apply, in which a handful of pieces are randomly removed from the game (face down) before the game begins.  This might improve the game enough to warrant a second play, though either way I can't see a third game in my future.

Haven't played too much, but it looks pretty fun.  The bell is...well, a bell, for better or for worse. [edit] No longer own--included it as a surprise bonus in a trade, but I guess the person didn't appreciate it, since I never heard that they received it.

Seems to me that this is a parts set.  Only 49 of 56 cards are present, many of which show use/abuse.  There is no rule set, but the bell is present.  If nothing else, I have a bell I can use for another game, or for my classroom.

RATING: 7
This is a great game for kids. With some creativity the game can become quite educational (f.e. get to the number 10 first by adding, substracting, multiplying or dividing the same type of fruit available on the table (any other number greater than 5 smaller than, say, 20 could be used)).

Los jugadores van sacando cartas con figuras de frutas. Cuando hay cinco frutas del mismo tipo visibles, hay que pulsar un timbre. El que lo consiga, se queda con todas las cartas desveladas.

Speed game that is fun for a few seconds.  Of course, our group is dominated by 1 or 2 people who just smoke everyone else at this game so people like me are left there just watching a pile of cards get smaller, and smaller, and smaller.

How many times have we heard the phrase "it's fun in any language" ?  Now how many times has that been true about anything other then . . . well you know ;)

Halli Galli is truly a classic party game / filler, that requires a bit of thought.  It can be a ton of fun with a raucous group.  And you might not realize it's a raucous group until the game get's into full swing.  You'll laugh, you'll cry (bells can hurt!), you might rupture something.

Expect to see 30 odd penalty minutes accessed during the course of a five minute game for infractions like obstruction, hooking, and an occasional slashing.  Game misconducts are rare, but not unheard of, after all everyone likes plums.

Many groups outlaw long nailed players.

Galli requires quick thinking, a tad of strategy in how to flip your card (when a five card+ is showing, or when you want to draw an opponent "offside"), the rules are simple, and you can come from behind to win.  All good traits in a game.

Simple rules, great for small parties. Playing with friends who are very eager to win may cause some injuries when several people smash your hand down on the bell (which you will happily endure, as it means you won the round), accidentally (although you will have to take their word on that) dig their nails into your skin when smashing the bell, or in their haste hit the bell and send it flying at you across the table.

Yes, it is great fun, but only if you have the reflexes to contend with your friends OR if you know you will be getting a good show where others bruise each other's hands. Also, the bell itself is a great tool to liven up parties or annoy your neighbours when you decide to play the game in the middle of the night.

I suppose you could also play it with children, just not combined with the overly enthusiastic adults.

I would strongly recommend this game to just about anyone.

Played 1 time. Certainly a game should be judged "for what it is" but even then, if a game just doesn&#039;t strike you as fun, you can&#039;t rate it that highly. It is sort-of fun, but then again, it sort of doesn&#039;t have a lot to do. It&#039;s all about fast reflexes, and since I have them, I always win and no one else has any fun at all. I imagine this would be the case for a lot of groups. Someone with quick relfexes will take the majority of cards the majority of playings -- and is that fun? Besides, E.R.S. (Egyptian War to me is more fun and be played with a standard deck.) This game doesn&#039;t even get the "Fun for kids and adults" since, again, faster reflexes will win all the time.

On my [b]2nd play[/b], my opinion went down. I like speed games, but I don't enjoy looking for five items.

An excellent kiddy / adult game that I would normally give a 7 but the recent Dr Wood version having such a good bell (which I can use for games of Pit)! (10/1/10). UPDATE: When played with kids, still a good game. However, there are two aspects about the game which is making me enjoy it less.  First, if a five card is played (when there is also other fruit), it is a good bet when the other fruit is covered, people risk the turn to snap up the cards (especially if the only penalty is loss of a card per player).  Second; when it gets down to two players who are evenly matched, the game drags to a conclusion (Rating reduced from 8 to 6: August 2014). UPDATE: Rerate for Top 100; rating 6.326 (Jan 15).

Average dexterity game, there are much better dexterity games in market. One of the most annoying things in this game is that "hotel bell". However younger kids might have fun with it and counting till 5 is also good for young kids. I would recommend this game for playing with young kids only. As a dexterity or filler game it's useless - choose Ghost Blitz or Jungle Speed instead...

While not something I'd personally choose often, this is a *very* good game with kids ages 5-10. We had hours (and hours) of fun with this one. It's simple, the graphic illustrations are easy to grasp and look good, and the bell is a big hit [sic, don't blame me for that joke].

Unfortunately after years of use the bell was used for something else then lost, the cards were thrashed and a few lost, and it eventually hit the garbage bin... which is a sad fate for such a well-loved game.

RATING: 7
Played this with Daughter the Elder and Melissa.  There is a lot of potential of injury due to finger nails and/or squashed hands with competitive players (i.e. us!).  We noticed that we had a slight, although only slight, advantage over Daughter the Elder (six) when playing this so actually held back a little - this in itself is interesting since I know I don't normally hold back when playing games such as Around the World in 80 Days, Balloon Cup or Settlers of Catan with her.  Daughter the Younger (age two) also loves this, but mainly just to hit the bell and say "Me play Halli Galli!"  A very good children's game for children of the same sort of age or more importantly, the same mathematical prowess.  After just one game Daughter the Elder has already sussed out that it there where three bananas showing then you were looking for a two banana card to come up to ring the bell, i.e. do the  maths before the card is turned as opposed to after it.  She's a clever cookie that one :-)

Don't play this game when your girlfriend has sharp nails. I think I still have a scar on my finger.

My tactic: Wear a heavy ring. Slam the bell when the fruit combo shows up. Don't bother trying to be first. Last place is good as well. They'll learn.

If you enjoy speed based pattern recognition games, this is another solid addition to that genre.  It is very simple and straightforward to play as everyone reaches to ring the bell whenever a type of fruit adds up to 5 pieces.  Whoever does takes all the discards in front of everyone and the winner of the game is the person with the most cards when only 2 people are left in the game.

It's the ancestor of Jungle Speed. You hit the bell instead of grabbing a totem and everyone can hit it every time (you hit it when everyones cards show certain amount of fruits) so it's more involving. It's classic family fun.

Bell is annoying but usually it doesn't ring due to too many hands hitting it simultaneously. The only limiting factor would be that bell, since because of that, the game cannot be played just anywhere.

Still, a pleasant game to pull out every now and again.  Perhaps when the kids are a little older it will see more play.

Halli Galli -- 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The more stupid take on Jungle Speed. Probably an ancestor of Jungle Speed. So: speed recognition game. But with greater emphasis on speed than recognition part. 

Like in JS - everybody has their own stack of cards, you turn your top card face up (away from you) and watch for the trigger. In this game this is: when 5 or more of the same fruit are shown on all player's cards. 
Then you hit the bell in the middle of the table. Oh, joy! . 
Different to JS this isn't a game of getting rid of your cards, but of getting all the cards. So players will be eliminated. And the game seriously drags in the end game. We usually just end when there's just 2 players left and compare their stacks. 

It's a popular game with kids, because oh so simple. And the Clingclingcling sound. 
However another problem (apart of the dramaturgy of ending) is that it's easy to get skilled enough that pure bodily reflexes win the game (not speed of recognition, but just how fast you can ring that bell). Also - it's possible to hurt your fingers if two players dive in from the opposite end (Jungle Speed's totem did fix this). 

It's good for smaller kids. If you're serious about speed games Jungle Speed is better (and comes without the bell. Can get annoying I imagine).

Played once with 3P. Despite having the reflexes of a marshmallow, I find speed-based games such as Jungle Speed and Ghost Blitz fun, so Halli Galli is a no-brainer for me. It offers something different from other similar games, and hones simple addition skills. I also think that pressing a bell, rather then grabbing items, is more effective in determining who got it first. It possibly gets more interesting with more players, but is perfectly serviceable when played with 3.

This a fun little quick-reaction game. 

The deck is divided into equal stacks in front of each player. Each card shows 1-5 pictures of different items. On your turn you flip the top card of your stack onto your discard pile. Then it's a race: if there are exactly five of any picture showing on the top cards of all players' discard stacks, the first person to ring the bell collects all discard stacks and adds it to the bottom of their draw deck. Then play resumes. You're knocked out if you run out of cards in your draw deck. Continue playing till only 2 players are left. They continue playing till someone wins the remaining discard piles, then count their cards: player with the most cards wins.

Stupid, random game almost without any decisions but is very funny for kids and improves their calculation skills. Add +1 to rating when playing with children.

Halli Galli is just plain FUN and a bit of a brainer...but then again, anyone can count to 5! Ringing that bell is lots of fun, especially when someone gets it wrong!

I was hoping this would be a fun diversion from Jungle Speed, but it's pretty drastically inferior.  I think there needs to be more cards in the deck because it really wasn't enough cards with 6 people.  It's not bad, but it's not great either.

Rated as a kids game. Drop rating by 4 when played with adults.

Own a junior version of this game (match clowns, only 2 variables to match), making this even lighter as the normal version. Hence, rated as a kids game. 

For a kids game, this is a great game. Quick, really easy rules and because for the  dexterity aspect allows them to outshine adults without heavy modification of the rules. Also teaches them recognition skills, which is a plus. But most important, they learn how to take a loss and the value of a self-earned win. Because it is easy to have them lose several small piles only to come back on a huge one and grab that unexpected win! 

Recommended if you have small kids! As a filler I would prefer something else but if you dig dexterity games this is a staple game.

[APR 2017] As my youngest hits 5 he has lost interest in this game. Which means it is ready to go as I don't like dexterity games (Tumblin Dice being the only exception for its silly atmosphere and rooting on your pals for trying to gang up on the leader).

I think this game is only for children. I don't think it works for adults even as a (drunken) partygame. But that's just my opinion. 

Good for kids to learn to count fast and react. Also it's very trackable if someone was wrong or not. Everyone can clearly see it on the table, no arguements. Kids like the bell, so it's easy to get them to play.

This game was fun . . . until we read the rules.  We will continue to bring it out and "Calvinball" it - you've got cards and a bell, what else do you need?

RATING: 6
This is a fruit-themed game, which makes it kind of unique.  It also has an annoying bell which can be fun or obnoxious depending on your location or disposition.  I'm not particularly fond of the slap-jack mechanism, but this turns out to be a fairly entertaining spin on that.

It's always fun to try to smash another player's fingers to pieces. But there are usually more interesting games to play.

I can't even come close to playing this with kids.  In my last game, I literally sat there, as kids just kept pounding the (now broken) bell.  I'm just not fast enough.

You try to be quicker than your opponent in order to ring the bell first if certain cards appear.
Loved it as a kid, but nowadays I cannot recommend it anymore, at least for adults :)

Lame, proprietary game based on the same principles as [gameid=15712] (ERS).  If given the choice, I would almost always choose the public domain ERS, as it is more easily varied, needs no special components beyond the deck of cards even grandma has laying around, and is more familiar to most people.  This game does have a nice bell with it, but that's not enough to justify the space it'll take on your shelf or the money you'll spend.  Unless ERS is still in your group's regular rotation (hah!), avoid this one like the future landfill occupant it is.

Another great introductory game.  Very simple rules (exactly 5 fruits on the table and hit the bell), plays quickly.  It's a bit silly but that's what i like about it :-)
Although the bell is well-made, it may break

RATING: 7
Power Grid is, at its core, an accounting exercise, but, as strange as it might sound, it can be a *fun* accounting exercise. You have to optimize your energy production through a careful choice of the power plants you want to run, taking into consideration their power output, their cost (you have to bid for them) and the resources it takes to run them. Throw in a nice economical system for resource pricing, a bit of positional play when you choose the cities you supply with electricity and that's almost it. Not exactly a gateway game, rules are functional but somewhat fiddly and it can be quite long, but it also offers interesting decisions and just a bit of luck. It can feel dry and I don’t consider it a game for every crowd, but it surely deserves at least a try.

Beautiful mechanics. I actually enjoy the calculation part which seems to turn some people off. The theme is very refreshing after lots of "let's build random stuff set in a nondescript medieval period" games (don't get me wrong - I love those!), and way more exciting than it might sound. It's also quite easy to understand, rule-wise, so the basic principles can be explained to others in no time at all. This game just *works* for me.

RATING: 9
Based on one play.  I found the game to be really well designed and with easy to grasp rules and excellent tactical options, but not particularly fun.  Would play again though and it appears to have a lot of re-play value.  Like a railway building game with auction and resource management phases tacked on.  Will update with more plays.

Updated after more plays and I've got to say that I love this game.

Much more attractive and quicker than it's parent. If anything, it seems to end before you get the chance to fully deploy your strategy. Lots of subtle decisions to make though. The expansion maps only add a little bit of variety and unless you're playing the game every week, the base game is more than sufficient

This game has lots of things I like; courtesy of the rubber band effect, it stays close till the end (but I understand why it's annoying to make any inroads before the end only to have them erased and with experienced players, it's just a jockeying for positional bounce). It has area influence/control elements in terms of route building and pricing of the locations. The nuance of the auction in terms of both bidding and nominating is fantastic. It's a game that rewards those who understand how to ride (and abuse) the turn order system, and can do long budgeting (much more so than other auction/econ games). I generally enjoy playing it, but I just don't get jazzed about the game; I don't request it, and I admit, I'll sort of think of whether I want to dedicate that sort of time to it if asked. It's a game where if someone said "you have 4 hours, would you rather play 1 game of Indonesia or 2 of Power Grid" I'd say Indonesia hands down, but if I only have 90-120 minutes, then I'd consider Power Grid. It fits in that smaller time frame.

Great game. Wish I could get it to the table more often.

UPDATED 5-28-14: Bumped it down to a 7 from an 8. Still like this game, but we have noticed that, at least in a 2 player game, the last round is absent of any surprise element once the bidding phase is over. You know exactly how many cities you can power as well as your opponent, and so at that point if one person has the advantage, the game is over.

UPDATE 6-17-15: Traded with Power Grid for Smash Up in Dice Tower Con Math Trade.

I liked the slow build of tension in this game and was really fond of it for the longest time, yet these days I wish it could be accelerated somehow or that there was more going on. Its strength is its weakness; the simple cycle of auction, buy, build wears on me after 8-10 iterations. A solid game but these days there are so many I'd choose first. 

edit: seems as time passes my opinion of this one continues to decline. It's essentially a light economic game that's surprisingly fiddly and 2 hours long. Nah.

I don't know what, but something about this game just doesn't do it for me. Despite the seeming compelling premise and game mechanics, I am strangely dispassionate about it along with our gaming group who have on numerous occasions -gasp- stopped playing in the middle of a game! "Oh, the pizza's here? Let's just pack this game up and start a different one when we're done eating." Of course, I'm not overly keen on the bidding mechanic anyway...

The godfather of the economic simulation, Power Grid is an excellent medium weight, mathy game that can lead to very intense scenarios, particularly at the bidding table. Although the running time is a little long, especially with groups prone to analysis paralysis (like mine) it is still a stellar addition to my gaming collection I would always be happy to play!

I don't get the appeal, and I know it's just me.  I don't like the luck of the plants order, and I don't like the turn order mechanisms (1st for this, last for that...).  I just don't enjoy it at all.

RATING: 6
Many people seem to love this kind of theme and mechanics.
I really prefer pure & simple mechanics instead of the lots of tables & numbers that are present in this game. Despite its complexity on the surface, delving deeper it seems that there's not a lot to strategize here if you play with a lot of players. (Tried with 6.) You won't be able to predict a lot in this case.
Lots of money calculations needed. I have enough of this in real life...
Also the 'player order' mechanism always tries to push the last players forward and tries to keep the best players from expanding too quicly (they can only buy more expensive resources and buy towns last).
This creates a nice illusion of a 'close race' but for me it felt like being on a rollercoaster: thrilling, but a fixed experience determined by complex numerical mechanics. And still not a lot of chance of catching on by e.g. pulling off a nice plan once you fall behind the others.

RATING: 9
Played it once (2 players) and the game seems VERY promising. Most likely even more fun with three players. Great economic simulation. Have a feeling this will become an 8 when I've tried it with three or more players.

Now an 8 (tried with 3). Might be even higher after more plays. Superb game.

Keeps growing on me. It's now a 9.

RATING: 6.5
Solid German game. I think the theme is better connected to the mechanics than Puerto Rico. Though I can't ever imagine myself saying "why doesn't someone make a game on buying power plants and the rights to power up cities", this game works and works pretty well if you're into the theme. There's great tension in the bidding process and the ever-changing available power plants. The map boards seem to create interesting dilemmas of position and placement. Overall, the game pieces are deluxe and nicely done with one exception: why the rules aren't in color is beyond me. I do have a creative design critique: why make the different types of wooden goods in strange shapes as non-cubes tend to roll around. I would have been satisfied with just different colored cubes but I'm more of a "functional gamer." I disagree with some reviewers with their belief that it's too mathematical as one can play most of this game without decisions being bogged down in equations. The very end-game (last couple of turns) can get math-heavy but the decisions are few at this point. It is an economic game with a focus on using your cash wisely and that's not going to appeal to everybody. This one should see plenty of play in our gaming group. 

Update: Lowering my rating from 8.5 to 6.5. I was wrong as the game is too math heavy for my taste. To play it well, you have to be planning at least a full turn ahead and calculate your money down to the last dollar. It has a run-away leader problem as there's very little you can do (without destroying yourself) to reign someone in if they get lucky in auctions. The auction mechanism can unbalance the game. Players may over pay for what are visible plants only to see a fresh plant pop up late in a turn that gives the loser of earlier auctions a golden opportunity (broken auction mechanism to me). It's also better to place later on the board for starting positions as there's no where to hide without hurting yourself and it's better to respond to player's positions than to try and stake one out. And how many auction games does the world need?

130929 The fact this game grinds to a halt at the last couple turns means I will avoid playing this game...maybe one more time with a different group just to make sure it wasn't a Houston groupthink issue.

110604 I've really come to hate the last couple turns of the game.  And it really doesn't work 2P.  I think there is a good 2P game there, but I haven't found it yet.

The game is not nearly as heavy as its reputation that seemed to had taken hold in my head.  I really like it and I have to admit the artwork is a big reason.  I really like the cartoony nature of it =).  The game moved pretty briskly (I was the only noob) and its an interesting exercise in math on the fly.  Last couple turns kinda drag though.

I've really enjoyed this one.  Not quite as much as some of the other heavy hitters, but still enjoy.  I feel the game may be just a bit too tight. And by that I mean, that it is structured in such a way as to keep players close and I feel it may do this too well!

RATING: 8
A really excellent game.  The learning curve is a little more difficult than other games I've played, however it's really rewarding once you get the hang of it.  When you get near the end of the game and all the resources are in short supply it can be really exciting, and often you won't know who will win right up to the last turn.  This should be a must play for anyone into strategy board games. Just make sure you have a lot of time to play it because with 3 people on my first full playthrough we were at it for about 4 hours.

RATING: 7.2
This is an economic efficiency game. I love the theme and the cartoony artwork (I work in the nuclear power industry), and the game is fun. It has simple rules, is easy to learn, and scales great with any number of players. I usually don't care for efficiency exercises, but I think the modern setting and theme make it more interesting for me.

The game does tend to get pretty mathy and analytical, though, which can be undesirable depending on my mood. The last turn tends to bog down as everyone starts really thinking about their every expenditure and counting everything, as that last turn is the one that really counts. It's one of the better Eurogames, but I'm usually in the mood for a game with more craziness and less math.

Powergrid is a really satisfying economy-building game. Loads of player interaction keeps things tense and interesting. The way the game is structured with phases/rounds segments all the different systems, meaning that at any given time a player only has to make one or two decisions, which is nice. The maths which some people dislike doesn't really bother me.

I really like the France map too. UPDATE: the tension in this game is excellent. It combines everything I love about games... route building, cool economics, a tense auction... I love this game!

A good game with one of the best catch-up mechanics I've seen. At the same time, my experiences have varied greatly depending on the gaming group. I wouldn't recommend playing this with 6 players.

Several clever play mechanics mesh together to create a fairly smooth-playing, balanced game. Highly enjoyable and deeper than it first appears, with interesting tactical decisionmaking. Player interaction is present in almost all phases of the game.

Update: having owned this for several years now, I always have fun playing this, despite having to always check the rules "just to make sure".

The strategy is fairly subtle, however, and if you're a person who likes to play all-out in whatever game you play, then this game isn't for you.

I've read a lot that 2 player is the worst way to play it and I can see the potential with more, but I've enjoyed several 2 player games of this. Would be interested to try it with the Robots expansion to enhance the competitive aspects. I love the mechanic with regards to goods availability and pricing. The imagery is nice on the cards. It's a shame that the theme won't appeal to everyone at a first glance. If not for the theme I think this would be very accessible.

Games with three and four players have confirmed that this is a great Euro-style game merging route-planning, a nice little catch-up mechanic, an enjoyable auction phase, and some neat resource management. Not a short game, but worth investing time in. It has become one of my favourite games.

After two plays, I'm fairly sure I don't like this game much.  I certainly respect the design and I can see why it has remained popular, but it feels like Accounting: The Board Game and I don't find it much fun.

Superlative. It truly deserves the rank on the 'Geek. There's a few odd moments in the rules, but when you play, it's butter.

For a mathy game - a genre I generally dislike - I find it surprisingly fun.

Juego de subastas de centrales eléctricas, unión de las distribuidoras, y gestión económica y mercado de recursos para abastecerlas. Mucho más ligero de lo que parece, incluso familiar, cambia el juego dependiendo del mapa jugado. Lo recomendaría a partir de 4 jugadores al menos, por el tema de las subastas, y cerrarse en el mapa. Otro pack de centrales también cambia un poco el juego. Tengo las cartas promocionales de centrales raras de Essen 2008-2010. Le bajo un poco la nota tras jugarlo varias partidas, por el factor correr hacia el final en solitario, y el jugarsela a ultimo turno, si no te has descolgado, y que lo tenia puntuado demasiado alto

Had to lower the rating. I still like the game but the way every game stalls between phase 1 and 3 is very annoying. Nobody wants to trigger phase 2 because it usually results in you being the last player for the first round of phase 2 and hence being blocked out of any real expansion opportunities. Furthermore, there is too much of doing sums which causes analysis paralysis. This was totally fine at the time, but at today's standards this is not a very elegant solution.

Rating may change in time.

A real thinker.  Like Age of Steam, there's plenty going on to think about, but it's thankfully a wee bit less cut-throat and desperate...maybe not by a lot, though.

So many decisions to make that it can get a bit analytical and mathematical - which is maybe a reason for knocking off a point here.  Having said that, the analysis thankfully comes in lots of small chunks which means the game flows quickly and there's not much down time between turns.

I found Steps 1 and 2 fun, but step 3 ended too soon and in fact the whole game can move from middle to end very quickly, leaving you feeling slightly anti-climactic.

Further plays may remove some of these problems, anmd I can see that it's a great game with lots of variation.  I like the artwork too, and the it's got a more meaningful theme than many Euros.

RATING: 6.5
Power Grid is a good game, and I can see why it's a popular classic of modern Euro games.  That said, having played many other Euros before finally giving it a play, it's nothing special to me.  It has a good level of strategy and replayability seems good, but it has some warts.

My biggest gripe about the game is the end game.  Granted I've only played it twice, but both games ended up with a tie for most powered cities and thus came down to cash on hand.  With cash being the first tiebreaker over total number of cities, there's very little incentive to expand to more cities than you can power in the end game, which to me is a mistake because it doesn't recognize any advantages a tied player has in board position at the end of the game.  Perhaps it is just a misalignment of expectations on my part to think that final board position should have some bearing on the game outcome, but it just feels to me like the number of cities should trump cash on hand as a tiebreaker.

Additionally, the fact that games tend to have close finishes also feels unsatisfying to me since it feels like the final outcome is something of a crapshoot that can be decided by a player bidding up one plant more than another.

Which brings me to another complaint, the kingmaker factor.  Going into the final round, there can be players who have no chance of winning, and yet their presence in the auction on the last round can give them the ability to help determine the winner by driving up the price of one plant or another.

All of this is not to say that Power Grid is a bad game.  I recognize that it is actually a good game and I have enjoyed my plays of it.  However, I just feel that, if it was initially released today, it would not have nearly the popularity it is.  I consider its popularity a product of its time, when it had less competition and could stand out from the field more easily.  For me personally, it doesn't come close to my top 10, and doesn't even crack my top 50.

TLDR: It's a good game, but these days there are just so many other games available that I enjoy more.

RATING: 1
Bought on trip to Kansas City - 

3/28/13 - Finally played. not that great. 

Very mathy. Each player on their turn has to make sure to have enough money to buy a power plant, raw materials, and a new city network, while at the same time trying to figure out the most efficient and economical way to do all three. This definetly favors those who are good with numbers.

There are also lot of ways to screw other people over. You can block people off from expanding their network, force them to overspend, or dump plants on the in the auction. Force them to overspend on resources.Frustrating for a game that will run over an hour to play.

The Board and the cards look great, but the money is terribly cheap and flimsy. All the other components are functional if lackluster, (the oil bits are annoying though. They're round and tend to roll everywhere.

Overall, I could really take or leave this one. The only reason I have to hold onto it is because I got it in KC.

The best new game I have played in a long time.  The only rough spot is replenishing supplies.  Since the table is in the book, it is not easily referenced by all players, making it a bit harder to figure into strategy decisions.  Maybe a card that shows how much is replenished in each round (a different card for each number of players, to keep it small and mangeable.)

A modern classic.
Extremely clever design, and seems to give an enjoyable game regardless of the number of players. A little mathematical with 2, and chaotic with 6, but always a lot of fun. The way the phases fit together, and the market mechanism works is simply ingenious

I wouldn't recommend many of the expansions, probably Korea is the most interesting but definitely no need to own more than one.

The box also features the best game art ever.

The game got nice mechanics (bidding and a supply/demand system) that secures a good gameplay. However the game also contains a lot of number crunching, which is a bit of a turn off. The theme doesnt really hit my soft spot either. Slightly boring.

I can't believe I've still never found time to get this one to the table, as everything about it suggests it is a game that would become among one of my most highly rated.

Maybe it is because whenever I pull out the box, everyone at the table looks at it and thinks, "Wow, that game really looks boring."  That's a really shallow criticism, of course.

Our first game went great!  On about turn three, there was a real "oooooh" moment with all the players when we started seeing how the different mechanics all fit together.  This one is very interesting so far!  I'm eager to get a few more games in so I can rate it.

Update:  After a couple more games, this one is an easy 8 for me.  I can tell that there's more to the strategy that I just don't grasp yet (especially after the neat trick my friend pulled in the last game for the win), and I suspect that the rating will climb for me when I do!

RATING: 7
Surely I am not the only person on this planet who has a special dislike for a special person, thing, or board game, that, after closer inspection turns out to be really irrational (please say yes?). I am, for example really bad with people. Repeatedly, I run into people who I believe to be arrogant, weird, self-centered or stupid (or combinations therof), and after a certain time of being forced to actually interact with them I find out that I would love for them to be among my best friends. And it seems to be the same with boardgames. But, to cite Game of Thrones, a man can only admit when he was wrong, and ask forgiveness.  So, I do admit that I was wrong. For the last five years I was convinced that Funkenschlag  was a horrible game. Turns out it is actually lots of fun to play.  It is nicely balanced, and even while it has a lot of "exchange stuff for other stuff" mechanics, it uses them in a very convincing way.
Even so, I still don't like Friedemann Friese for his F-fanatism. But, of course, I may be wrong here.

Excellent game! Combine the auction mechanic of games like Masterpiece with the resource management and territory control of Catan, and you get close to Power Grid.

It's very well balanced, and it does something very unique to maintain fairness and fierce competition: the players who have the most cities get to bid first, but the play order reverses during the resource purchasing and expansion stages of the round, meaning the players in last place get first dibs on the market. It sounds wonky, but it works remarkably well.

I really enjoy the theming, workmanship of the materials, and (most importantly), the game itself.

Played it 2 times now, both times with 3 players. Even though it was at first fun to play, the game is flawed at least for only 3 players. Both times, the game was decided before the 5th round was played. From then on, the leader couldn't be caught anymore. After the 10th round, all players had the necessary power plants to play the game to the end. With minimal planning, the leader can just full up his resources one time and then, with one free rousource power plant, run the game to the very end, connecting a city each move. 
In either case, we stopped playing around the 12th move, because there was simply no point in playing anymore.
Maybe this game functions with more players, but with 3 or less players the rules need a makeover, or just play for 7 cities (not 17).

Update: Now I played it with 5 players, same result. About at the end of step 1 (after 7 cities) you can't catch the leader anymore. The income is always big enough to connect at least one city, even if the leader can't power all his cities or doesn't want to. At about this time the leader also has enough power plants to power all cities that he needs to win the game. So the only thing to stop him would be the resources, but money doesn't matter at this point and resources were plenty enough.
So the rules ***ARE*** flawed, and we didn't finish the game ***AGAIN*** because it was pointless. 
Nevertheless, the game still deserves a "6", since up to the 7th or 8th move the game definitely is fun. After that, don't waste your time and play something else, because it becomes repetetive, boring and frustrating.

I liked:
- the ressource system, quite clever and fun (however i think ti's not exploited enough)
- the turn order system that brings some strategy
- the balance you have to find between the number of factory, what you can powerpowering up,

i didn't like:
- it's ugly
- The bidding system (aka we don't know how to blance the game so we will let the players do)
- The system to expend your city... it's not clever, it's ugly and uninteresting
- the system where factory that produce 5 or 6 are the only one needed

I played this twice at gaming group and loved it.  I think it appeals to the Thermodynamics nerd in me, even though it doesn't involve thermo equations.  If it did, it would be a 9.  If it had dinosaurs and thermo and spaceships, it would be a 10.  Just imagine:

Player 1: My power plant generates 230 MW of power.  I will power these two cities.
Player 2: You better re-calculate that.  My T-Rex just crushed one of your turbines.
Player 1: Yes, but my Warbird unleased 3 distruptor bolts and destroyed the city that you are trying to power.

We can wish, can't we?  Oh well, take it for what it is: one of the better Euros out there.

This is the most challenging game I've played so far. I have not played that many games however. It's not for the faint of heart as it requires you to constantly think ahead.

I was always slightly intimidated by this game but my first play was actually very fun. This game is a heavier game, has a lot of depth, but remains very fun. I also really liked the art design on the board (nice use of fonts). I wanted to play again before my first game was even finished actually. It is very well designed (I liked the way the economy worked and was impressed with how much thought must have went into the board layout) and it had a very fluid gameplay which is something I appreciate. Wow.

A fun game.  I'd like to get in another play or two - I don't have a good handle on strategies yet.

8/24/08 - Upgraded from a 7 to an 8.  I still don't have a handle on strategies, but I'm enjoying the game more and getting a better feel for it.  The original 7-rating was more so because I didn't "get" the game.  I still don't get it, but I better appreciate that it really is a good, well-done game.

Note:  Plays on expansion maps are listed under the respective BGG entries for the maps.

5/05/13 - So tempted to upgrade this to a 9.  I love it!  Among the expansion maps, I easily have +20 plays, probably more like +40.  Such an excellent game!  I still don't like the gaminess of the turn order, but at least now I know how to use it to my advantage.

9/04/13 - Upgraded to a 9.  The more I play this game, the more I appreciate it.  There are quite a few layers to it and they combine to produce a really exquisite game that can be played by novice and/or experienced players.

Every match at this game is beautiful, but requires a group of people who know how to play more or less the same level. Simply magnificent, has the flaw of using oil for the production of electricity, while many plants use natural gas nowadays. But this does not affect the game, of course!

I really enjoy this game when it's underway; I just never actually want to play it beforehand.  The jockeying for first and last place can get a bit brain burny, and with five or so players around I think there can be mild kingmaker effects in the last round (if X doesn't preemptively buy up the necessary fuels before leader Y's turn, frustrating Z's chances at the win).

Update:  A couple of games later with different maps (Korea and Italy), I've upped the rating on this one.

A self-explanatory title. Buy power plants, fuel them with resources, build houses, and then power the homes with the plants. The rule book was intimidating for me, but after Maggie and I played through this once, everything clicked. I look forward to playing this with 3 or more players, which should make the power plant auctions more interesting. :)

Wonderful player aids are available in the files section.

Recommended with 3-6 players (best 4-5). 120 mins.

3 out of 4 times I have a great time playing this. The 4th is miserable, a horribly long experience that puts me off the game for awhile. Then I play it again and love it.
Age of Steam may eventually push this out of playing. We'll see.
Edit: AoS pushed it out of my collection. Some of my more casual gamer friends were sad for a second and then remembered the horribly long experience and were happy again.

Power Grid is clearly a very good game, and deserves better than this rating.  Unfortunately for us, it's (A) not nearly as good for just two and (B) very arithmetic-y, which is ok but doesn't appeal to us.  A very well-done game that just doesn't work in our case.

Our copy went to a good home in Chicago, where it will be treated as a good game should be, and played occasionally.

Good theme play.  Game is easy to learn and play; however, game play is rather dull.  Nothing new as far as game mechanics - auction, 'worker' placement.  Downtime can also be an issue.  Components are of good quality, although cards may not be durable.

When you get into gear to play this game, it all of a sudden ends. The only nice thing about it is that you have to find a balance between your different power stations relating to different raw material consumption of it. So you have to keep close watch who can buy raw material first. 
Otherwise it is very shallow.

RATING: 4
So far I really like the bidding, like the resource market, kind of neutral on the positional play (haven't really engaged with that yet) and sort of dislike the snowballing aspect. I haven't seen a lot of jockeying for turn order yet.

There are important decisions to make, some of them kind of subtle like when to under-fire, but most of them are fairly automatic. The plant market can be pretty damn random. 

The rulebook sucks and contradicts itself in some places. Seriously, how hard is it to have a functional rulebook in eight pages by your nth printing?

[-]I like this more than my other 7s and a couple of my 8s but I just don't think it's as mechanically sound as, say, Puerto Rico so I don't rate it higher. The thing I like the most is the bidding and I suspect there are better bidding games.[/-] I won because of a fortuitous plant draw last time and it really soured me. This is a solid seven, perhaps dropping with more play.

update: I haven't played in a while but I just don't feel a need to play. The route building is underwhelming compared to 1830 and auctions aren't as intense as Chicago Express. The resource market is really cool but I wish it were bolted on to a better game. 

The best short description of this game is that it its relentlessly one-note.

you get to set up connections between cities while bidding at auctions for more and more efficient power stations to power those cities with. Thing is, it also has a brilliant Supply/Demand=Price mechanism that means competition can make things expensive for you when buying resources to power your stations. It is really, really, really great.

My biggest issue with PG is it's unforgiving runaway factor. The last time we played, I took a 2 city lead early, dominated the game, and blew out everyone else by 5 cities in the end over the course of 2+ hours. You'd think that would be fun for me, but I actually found it to be extremely dull and boring. Since I had more money than everyone else, I could purchase the best card at auction and leave everyone else to fight over the scraps. And I didn't have to worry about resource costs because I could still purchase them at a high price (and that's if I didn't already have "green" power).

You could argue that more experienced players are at a distinct advantage over newbies, but in this case, we were all at a similar level. I tend to agree with the general consensus on BGG that the player that takes the lead ends up winning. 

I prefer games that: let players "gang up" to slow down the leader, let even the weakest player have a participatory role (nothing like playing C&K of Catan and not being able to do anything for 2.5 hours), and allows the possibility for a different player take the lead.

Played Power Grid several times before I started tracking my games played (approx. 3-7 times). 

*** UPDATE 1: My opinion has changed on this one for the following reasons: (a) relativity to other games I've been playing - it is clear now that PG is simply well done in comparison to most games, (b) the new maps are a delight and Benelux is a great intro board, (c) the new power plant deck and rules make the game more forgiving. ***

*** UPDATE 2: Yeah, I find this game very long, drawn out, and plain dull. The maps all look the same - it could be anywhere. In fact, you don't ever need to know the city names or where they are. I do think PG is a great economy and auctioning game - but if it played in half the time, I would like it way better. ***

Excellent game with lots of tough choices throughout. I like the resource management aspect of the game and how it meshes nicely with the plant auctions as well as with plant building (the cheaper your resources the more money you have to build). There can be some luck of the draw issues with the power plant draws but that just means that you can't expect that each game will progress the same as the last so you have to maintain some flexibility in your strategy. A solid game at the heavier end of the game weight spectrum.

not excited for 2 players.
1st player = curse.
too much algebra for buying resources and building.
market restock provides a good feeling.

for 2-3 players the board is asymmetrical, so a player in the center has naturally better position (although three south Germany regions seems to solve this). 

In 2011 'Robots' expansion came out, "designed especially for two players".

The game is okay, but it's definitely a game where there is a huge gap between casual players and those who've mastered its strategies. If you want to play well, you have to really know the cards, the economics, the board, and how to plan several moves ahead. For those who just evaluate the board as it is on any given turn, placing will be pretty much a matter of luck.

A better "Monopoly?"

This game reminds me of short-track speed skating. You inch up and keep pace and jocky for turn order, but it's an exciting surge at the end that makes or brakes your game. But that feeling, I feel, should be in a shorter game.

Thank you very much for the trade, Brian (elrond108)!

Fun resource management game with a real world feel.  This really well depicts the fuel supply/demand market, which makes it a really neat game (maybe b/c I work for an oil company).  Players turn order determines which order they auction off power plants & buy resources, which is a big deal since the first player who can buy resources (coal, oil, trash, or uranium) gets to buy it at the cheapest prices, while the next players have to pay more since the supply market is shrinking.  Also, this games is very easy to learn and get a grasp of, since each turn occurs in the same order of steps, so you really get a chance to start working on your strategy in game 1.

After more plays, the game starts to lose its appeal.  It sill plays well, but each game feels the same and the same strategies are present, only tweaking to deal with the difference in other players.

RATING: 10
One of the most consistently competitive games I have played.  It's an economic game of efficiencies where players battle in three arenas (for territory on the map, for resources on the board, and for power plants on the market) while a unique balancing mechanic manipulates turn order to allow players who have fallen behind to charge back in.  The only randomness comes from the power plant market, but this has enough of an impact to keep the game fresh every time you play, as a strategy that worked for you before may not be feasible the next time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The objective of Power Grid is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network gains a predetermined size. In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they use to power their cities.

However, as plants are purchased, newer, more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing, you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.

I enjoy this game immensely with two or three. It's probably just as great with more people, but since I don't have a chance to play it much with more than two, I often overextend and come in third or so. Which isn't a bad thing, just a thing. Power Grid also has given rise to "Power Grid Syndrome" -- being just $1 short for what you want to accomplish in a turn.

It took a while after getting into the hobby before I had a chance to play this one, and had only ever seen positive reviews about it and heard positive things, from friends. So, perhaps it was just overhyped for me. Maybe with another play, my rating will improve.

It wasn't bad, but it wasn't exceptional either.

I had been expecting something that gave a sense of powering a grid of cities, but the mechanisms really made no sense for that. It felt entirely like a bag of mechanisms, and that was a bit disappointing for a game that seems to be so loved.

The area control system seemed a bit funky, making it too easy to block others in. I had played (and own) the game, Medieval Merchants, which inspired Power Grid's expansion mechanism, and found the original version to be better since there's still a chance to get in on a city before it gets cut off, and many more routes to take around it if I am too late. It seemed like it would have been better if I was only allowed to reserve cities one past a powered city, so that you couldn't swamp territory and box others in so easily (I felt bad fencing one player into a corner for one full step).

In terms of economic simulation, I didn't find it terribly interesting, nor the auctions. In terms of a race to upgrade my business, Viticulture does it with more flavor and multiple possible routes to victory.

It seems like a pretty decent gateway game, to charm people away from Monopoly (much better than Catan). But, to accomplish that, I would expect very streamlined and simple mechanisms. Instead, there's quite a bit of fiddliness to provide the correct range of power stations as the players level up, while still keeping it a bit random. And there's quite a bit of fiddliness with the rules for advancing through "steps". For a game which amounts to "Buy the most cost effective item on the market" and "Try to land-grab cheap, while blocking off your neighbors", it feels like there should have been a way to provide those two mechanisms with far less fuss. While it may not have been developed with the intent of being a gateway game, it feels like - by this point - the designer should have gone back into it and cleaned it up a bit.

It plays very tight, we had 3/5 players with 16 powered plants and within $11 of each other at the end. It is definitely easy to see how a major mistake bidding on a powerplant can completely set you back early on, or make someone else's life very easy for a time. Very intuitive, but appears to be very dense at first. Don't play this with people who don't like conflict.

Pretty good with two, better with three, eager to bring this out with the four or five. The map does get tight and the resource market can certainly jump around. Very enjoyable.

Only things: with three, it seems like there's not a whole lot of bidding on plants. Likely, this will change as players figure out which plants are "better", or otherwise figure the game out (as in, bidding more for garbage is coal is being contested). Still, it seems like, with three, it's easy enough to all settle into different resources (though you'd clearly want to block the coal burner). Still, very thinky and a lot of neat mechanisms.

2/13: It's ok. I'll play it, but don't see why it's so hugely popular. The first phase can really drag out if people don't or can't build. Lots of downtime and solitaire.

8/17: I wasn't wrong back then, but those things bother me less now and I see its strengths more. The game also stays interesting with expansion maps.

I like the theme and empire building character of the game, but I've noticed that those who are in the lead are not always the ones who are going to win. The one in the lead is placed in the most disadvantage position in every phase. Basically I do not object to this, since it gives lesser players an opportunity to keep up and this keeps the game fun for everyone. This is probably the main reason for the popularity of this game.

However I have noticed that the lesser gods are able to ruin the game for those in the lead. For example by buying all specific fuel, so that there is nothing left for you. With far too dramatic results. Or the bidding limit of one power plant per turn. There is actually little bidding and the last player always can take the plant he wants. Of course this is all legitimate, but I believe this is not in the spirit of the game.

Although annoyments happen now and then, I still play this game with enthousiasm.

Perhaps a bit dry, but one of the best economic games I know of. The combination of the auction mechanic for power plants with the supply-demand market mechanic for fuels works wonderfully and creates multiple viable strategies. The only downside is that buying and fueling plants is so compelling that new players can be distracted from the real victory condition, which depends on powering cities.

:arrowE: [u]Synopsis[/u]:
Power Grid is the single game responsible for my going from person who casually plays board games on occasion to hobby board gamer. 

Game-driven market economy for fuel and player-driven auctions for power plants lead to a wonderful blend of strategic and tactical play. Buy power plants, fill them with fuel, expand your energy network, and power cities for cashmonies. Take that capital and invest in better plants, stock up on fuel to hedge against the market and screw other players. Plot your network to ensure strong income and long-term placement. The game ends when a set number of cities are connected in any player's network, but only the player who can power the most cities [i]at that immediate point in time[/i] wins. 

:arrowE: [u]What I like most[/u]:
This game requires both sound play on the table and reading the players around the table. Seeing as auctions have no set limit to how much can be bid or how many times, there is no set "best" way to bid for anything, so optimal play rests on the discernment of players on the fly. This fits directly with monitoring available power plant output and the efficiency therein. Is it worth holding onto a clunker oil refinery to stockpile lots of fuel from the market, or ignore potential blocking by going straight for hyper-efficient plants, instead? From there, breaking into or crashing certain fuel markets can swing the game into new direction based on the plants already in play.

:arrowE: [u]What I like least[/u]:
As with most economic games, players without much experience can bid poorly and throw the game. This can also coincide with network expansion which severely hampers a singled-out player.

Impressive game.  Finely balanced between the auctions, acquisition of resources, costs for expansion, managing the changing turn-order and generating income, with money being so tightly constrained.

But it is incredibly dry and with loads of downtime due to the mathy-ness.  Not that it's complex, it just needs a lot of addition and subtraction to plan an effective strategy.

I'm glad I had a chance to play it, and I can appreciate why it is arted so highly, but I'm unlikely ever to request it again - it's just not really my style of game, which tends toward shorter games with a strong thematic flavour.

After about 30 plays, it only gets better. It's easier to teach than most heavyweights, because the rules are simple, but people always get a lightbulb above their head when they start realizing the tricks you can pull. It has a bit of a chaotic feel with more than 4, you can get screwed without doing anything wrong, and the calculation necessary to play at a high level is intimidating f2f.

先聲明，電力公司不是我的最愛，我沒有要幫它說話，純粹是就「機制單純或複雜」一事聊聊一些想法。

我個人是覺得，遊戲機制單純或複雜，各有它的優點也有缺點，但如何各自在單純或複雜的領域調味，就要看廚師如何炒菜。

既然單純或複雜各有優缺點，那單純或複雜對設計師來說，應該就是一個選擇而已，而這樣的選擇並不會決定了這遊戲的品質高低。就像披頭四早期選擇了相對其他音樂的單純編曲，但在安排的巧妙下，成品就是悅耳的，遊戲設計也是同理可證，

回頭到電力公司的遊戲機制與流程，相對現在機制拼盤的遊戲來說是單純的，核心機制也是現在常見，但它的在平衡調整以及細部的設定上，有它值得玩味的地方。

比如說
。發電廠賺錢的邊際效益，是隨數量慢慢遞減。
。發電廠需要的燃料市場是會根據供需間的關係而有所浮動。
。玩家順位是每回合浮動的，藉以平衡領先者與弱後者的差距。
。遊戲分成三個階段，各有細微的調整，獲勝不是單純比量或是比大，也就是不是比誰買的東西多或是誰賺得錢多，所以獲勝條件是有其玩味之處。

The definition of a light-to medium weight economic game.

Many things in the game depend on what your opponents do and this makes every play very diferrent.

Whereas I find the game design flawless as it is, I personally don't like the fact that players compete to place factories on the board. Situations may occur where a player's economy fails to thrive early in the game because other players blocked him.

I can’t comprehend why this game is rated so high.  I have played it 3 or 4 times and the gameplay seems contrived.  It takes “runaway leader avoidance” to an extreme.  The board adds a isolated element of unnecessary complexity to the game.  Throw out the board and repair the Rochester purchasing system and you might have a decent bidding system.  Play Princes of Florence instead.

This is a great game to take players of Ticket to Ride to the next level.  You're still building routes but now you're adding bidding and resource management to the mix.

Hmmm...a game that really feels like a pleasant, atmospheric gaming experience.  More so than in almost any game I have played, with Power Grid, I sense the very strong hand of a game designer who is quite skilled at delivering you into his chosen world (the Power Grid world) complete with an affecting, somewhat discomfiting, euro-minimalist aesthetic.  Quirky thing this Power Grid. Sure it's competitive and money/resource calculation intensive, but it is the aesthetic and feel of this game, and strong hand of the designer (last place must be given some advantage...every turn...ok), that I really feel uniquely with this game.

Simplemente un gran juego, luego de un par de partidas te das cuenta de lo bien hechas que están las mecánicas, y lo realmente destacable de ellas que hace que ningún jugador se escape de forma excesiva de los demás.

Es un juego de gestión de recursos, si, pero sobre todo es un juego de optimización. Optimización entre las plantas que compras, su capacidad de iluminar, los recursos que requiere y puedes comprar, y para donde puedes expandir tu red eléctrica (y a que costo!). Si no te gusta calcular mucho, este no será tu juego, pero si eso no te detiene tendrás uno de los grandes, con subastas, demanda de recursos, entre otros.

Eso si, es un eurogame puro y duro, por lo que no tiene mucha inmersión, aún cuando las subastas y la compra de recursos te da la sensación de estar en los negocios de cierta forma, pero es un juego "excel" al fin el al cabo.

Behold the awesome POWER of Funkenschlag! Besides the really hilarious movie featuring Friedemann Friese himself (at www.boardgameswithscott.com <- go see that) it explaines the full game and it's extremely hilarious/retarded. The game mechanic with a Powerplant market (4 power plants available with different stats) intertwined with the resource market it makes a really cool game. Both the markets make this one of the very best games that incorporate economic systems. 

Though the game is a little bit light compared to the medium-heavy weight German-games like Puerto Rico and Caylus, it is very good, and very simple to play and explain. Therefore this is one of the top german games. Easy to explain, fun to play, hard to master.

{1 play, 5 player} I'm giving this the same rating as Funkenschlag... but after only one play, I think I may prefer the original.  Power Grid is certainly a nicer production, and though I like the streamlined game (especially paying for connections rather than drawing them), this "shorter" version (still two+ hours) just feels like it's missing something.  Perhaps it's because I've played the original - newcomers won't know the difference so maybe their ratings should carry more weight? - but there's no sense of building here, for me... no sense of shifting and growing from turn to turn.  In Power Grid, I bought 5 plants total (and won, by the way), which means I ended the game with one of my "original" plants.  That'd be pretty tough to pull off in Funkenschlag, where you really FEEL the differences between the 3 phases.  Not that we even came close to Phase 3 in Power Grid (when the game ended in Phase 2, I checked the deck - the Phase 3 card was 5 deep!)  Of course, you could just play to more cities or readjust the newer bigger payouts to the smaller old school method.  And I have only played it the one time, so far.  Regardless of my misgivings, it's a novel system - novel series of systems.  And they still mesh well together in this quite interesting game.

*** UPDATE March 2008 ***

Well, prolly 3-4 years later, and I take some of that back.  Not that I think I'm wrong: the original Funkenschlag still *feels* more epic than the streamlined Power Grid, but the Grid is just as satisfying to me now, maybe even moreso.  Once I accepted the new ebb and flow of the game, I dug it.  In fact, I've only played original Funkenschlag once since Power Grid came out.  I'm sure part of that is me - my lack of interest now in any of the Crayon Rails games.  But I also think PG has more player interaction (partly because it's faster, maybe?) and the faster, smoother system makes each move count more (or at least it feels that way to me), so I find this version to be the better one now.  Plus the various different maps are cool.  And the expansion deck rocks.

This is a fantastic game.  Some brief reasons:

3.  Self-correcting play, where the leader is at a disadvantage.  Newbies have as good a shot as experienced players.
4.  High player interaction - even though there is little direct confrontation, everyone is competing for the same scarce resources - territory, markets, etc.  Minimizes downtime because you need to watch what others are doing.
5.  Unique and elegant mechanisms make this a different game each time.

Playing this with 6 people for the first time was really great. We are all economics savvy in some way and this game was a lot of fun! The cutesy looking trash and nuclear power plants are really great. I really like the market adjustments, colorful gameboard and pieces, and unique concept of producing power for cities!

Very good economic and strategy game. A bit hard to explain to newbies and non-gamers, also the overall presentation of the game is a bit lackluster (too much green and brown on the board). While I enjoyed the gaming sessions of Power Grid, the other players were put off by the length of the game and its difficulty.

A great game that is quite light, innovative, and combines several mechanics very well (auction, road building, markets).  It's virtue is that it's perfectly balanced.  But that's its flaw as well.  I've only played a few times (adn both times, with only 2 people), and both games were exceedingly close -- I think both games were decided by a tie-breaker (most money).

RATING: 6
Very very good game.  I enjoy how the game forces the players to have around the same number of cities.  It doesn't actually punish the leader, but only because the leader is not usually the person with the most cities -- power plants and money are far more important in determining who is in the lead.

Update after many plays: not that much game here.  Everything depends on how the power plants fall out of the auction, and how much the other players hurt you.  The remaining decisions are all fairly obvious.

Good game! Long term strategy is important (both in purchasing power plants and building your network), short-term desicions as well (e.g. will I have enough money for resources and building if I bid for this power plant?) - what more do you need? A little randomness is included, but just enough to keep things interesting.
Plus, I like the theme.

However, I had a 3 player game that was merely 'meh'. I would recommend at least 4.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fun theme and though a bit mathy there's enough different elements within a turn to keep things from feeling like  it's an accounting exercise or from feeling too heavy.  Clever turn order manipulation and commodity market, plus a variety of player interaction.  All in all a nice blend of game mechanics.

This game requires more luck than strategic thinking. The territory is very limited and uneven, so whether your move is first or last gives you a big handicap. An outsider has little chance to catch the leader.

Very good economic game that has nice player interaction with the auctions. Interesting tactical decisions are made in the game to try to control turn order since the player in last place gets access to the cheapest resources.

This would have to be my favorite modern classic game to date.  When I say modern classic I mean it could easily be picked up and played as a family game much like family games we grew up playing.  This has probably the best auction phase in a game that I have played and the resource management can get very cutthroat as well.  Many ways you can essentially screw your neighbor over in this game which is what a lot of modern board games are lacking.  Player interaction.  Seriously, if you haven't played it find someone that owns it and try it out.  It is worth your time.

RATING: 6
strange to come full circle on this one.  surprisingly accessible game, and one of my first eurogames.  i thought i liked it a lot, but my next couple plays made the endgame seem more and more deterministic.  "i can afford to do that, you can afford to do that, so i can run this up to..." and that sort of thing.  the multiplayer shutouts where people have no hope of winning because of plant limitations isn't fun either.  i thought hidden money would fix it, but it didn't, and having played so many more games since then i liked it so much worse.  my turn was still just a math puzzle, how many connections can i afford, how many resources should i buy based on those connections, etc.  the endgame was still hosed plant-wise, but instead of knowing on the money tiebreaks i just had to run up the auction a bit and have a best guess as to whether or not i had the most money.  this is one of the most beautiful games i've ever seen.  it's so inviting when i look at it, so it pains me to say that i'm not sure it's very good.

Power Grid is a GREAT GAME. Maybe last little to long, but I like it much. Power Grid in a interesting way merges economic aspect with importance of topography. There is also good balance between Personal Zone (each player has its own business: plants, resources) and Shared Zone (market, board with cities and connections). There is some math in this game, but I enjoy it. I also like Power Grid has serious and quite realistic "theme".

RATING: 5
After first play (5 players), so take this with a grain of salt:  

The game works OK, but it felt cumbersome due to the constant mechanics interruptions such as restocking fuel, the quirky management of what plants are up for auction, and the abominable transitions to phase 2 and 3 (I realize they are essential to make the game work properly, but seriously, what a mess!).  Despite the fact that the mechanics worked out in the end, by somewhere mid-game amidst the mental arithmetic and jockeying to go last in the turn order, I realized I really wasn't having any fun, and most decisions felt like they lacked much tension.  Might need to try it again to solidify my opinion on the matter, but I can't say I'm really looking forward to a second play.

For my group and the games we've played, this one has had the lowest learning curve to grasp the rules. I'm sure we'll spend some time grasping strategy, but that's another matter entirely. Even the questionable instruction book didn't stop us from having fun. We would collectively nod in understanding as the next rule sort of dawned on us. I labeled the game as medium heavy, but the setup less painful than most medium to heavyweight board games.

This is Monopoly times 100 in terms of strategy/tactics, but luck is 100 times less than monopoly. Yes, it's much better than Monopoly, but I wouldn't call it perfect either. 

There is something I find kind of erroneous about this game: it seems like always a bad idea to buy garbage early in the game, since garbage is more expensive. So you need to buy oil or coal.

It is easy to see why this game is popular.  Game play is streamlined and generally quite clean.  The auctioning of and ownership limit on power plants and the resource availability and purchase costs combine very well.  With route selection strategy making the third leg, this game has alot to offer a gamer.  The zone eliminations to account for number of players ensures a reasonable game length, but makes the map design feel incomplete.  An alternative map solution would be good.  [GTI Code: TGSD]

I love the beginng and middle parts of this game, but I find the ending strangely unsatisfying and anticlimatic.  Maybe this is because I haven't played this often enough and am not anticipating the endgame correctly.  Love the mechanics of the power plant auctions as well as the fuel purchases.  This is a game that people get hooked on and want to play a lot.  Right now I find myself passing on this in favor of other games.

RATING: 8.25
This game is amazing. The auctions are fun, and planning your connections to minimize cost involves some definite thought. Really this game all boils down to financial efficiency, and I think it makes for a fascinating game. There is also a lot of player interaction as you fight over plants at auction, drive up the price of resources, and fight for space on the board. The only negatives I have about this game are that the last couple turns can really bog down, people prone to AP can really make this game a chore, and there are certain types of people that can make the game pretty unbearable (those who calculate costs and forget one minute later). Having said all that, this is definitely one of my absolute favorite games.

The mechanics are great and the tactical decisions are many and you really need to think about your actions. The constant changing turn order is brilliant. I would enjoy it more if I didn't have to calculate all the costs all the time and the turn order mechanism can make the game "freeze" at times. Some people will find this game too mathy. There is some luck involved with the power plant market that may alter the outcome of the game entirely.

Klasszikus gazdasági eurogame, csúnya, de mégis vonzó design-al. Nagyon jól kitalált a felzárkoztató mechanizmusa, így ebben a játékban csak az maradhat le nagyon, aki valamilyen perverz oknál fogva le is akar. :) 
Az erőmű licitet sokkal agresszívebbnek hittem, így abban csalódnom kellett, mert hiába veszünk meg valamit nagyon drágán, az ellenfélnek úgy is jut jól használható erőmű (van hogy harmad/negyed annyiért), ergo nem érdemes nagy licitharcokba bonyolódni. A piac mechanizmusa jól működik, és az építkezés is érdekes tud lenni, főleg, ha 3 főnél többen játszuk. Egyenlőre nem kedvenc, de nagyon jó játéknak tartom, annak ellenére, hogy a mai modernebb játékokkal összevetve picit rosszul öregedett.

Great game.  Intense, lots of things to keep track of and unpredictable.  It does feel a little patched together and fiddly so print out some player aids from BGG before tackling it for the first time.

My rating has dropped a little.  The rules are badly written and formatted so getting back into the game after not playing for a while is tedious.  Also, the game is advertised as being suited to two players but after a couple of plays with two I disagree entirely.

For me Age of Steam has replaced Powergrid.  AoS is a tighter and more exciting game in my opinion.

Update: Rating getting completely hammered by AoS.. Unless the new expansion radically changes Powergrid I'm unlikely to want to play again.

RATING: 7
The more you dive into this game, the more there seems to explore. Everything --- from player order, what plants others own, where people are located, the phase, seating order, etc --- impacts the valuation and creates something that feels different/fresh every time you play. And it's a game where the strongest player isn't always evident as players often try to position themselves behind others, to gain advantages, in order to force the end and project themselves to the front; not only does this create a lot of tension throughout the game, it truly is a challenge to orchestrate and pull off. Overall, a truly enjoyable gem. 

The biggest concern about this game is that it can be arithmetically-heavy if players decide to math-out each turn. Personally, I don't mind playing competitively if everyone is on the same page. But it can really tank/slow-down the game and sour the experience for more casual gamers looking for a more fluid experience.

In first one I failed in finding the good strategy key (that is, build your cities in priority) ending in fourth position, but the game is really interesting and challenging. In second one I won! Not so difficult to learn, but difficult to win... A real outstanding game

Has just about everything, but really should include a calculator.

Dropped to 6.5 after more plays. It's just dry and repetitive enough that it doesn't grab me. I'll still play it, but there are lots of other games I enjoy more.

An excellent game. It can get a little bit chaotic at the endgame, but that's about all the bad things I can say about it. It's got great player interaction, a perfect natural progression, it's very well balanced and, most importantly: it's tons of fun!

UPDATE: Seriously considering ordering it very soon! :)

UPDATE: Just bought it. Will post back my comments on the actual board game (rather than the BSW version)

UPDATE: The face to face game is even better than the BSW version. Everyone seems to be involved in the game at all times, making their own strategies and even discussing them. I can only say I'm amazed by the excellent quality of this game!

UPDATE: Still a great game, but a bit long for what you get.

RATING: 7.5
An elegant design, but with some end game issues.

Amusingly, in my third game (first for a long while so I needed to relearn) against five 'experts', I found I was underpowered but, in pole position, and consequently unable to get better generators.  However I did have just enough cash to buy a 14th US city, 3 more than the next person, to end the game 'early' and to a chorus of 'you do realise that will end the game don't you!' and 'Kingmaker'.  Yes, but if I'm going to lose I would rather do so quickly and, to be fair, I haven't bothered to work out which king I was making.

Lack of resources arising from turn order can also hinder powering up in the final turn and a loss in an otherwise winning position.

Power Grid is always a satisfying experience that blends auctions, resource management, and stock markets games into one brilliant package.  go play it now!

Better with more players, maybe 4 or 5 is best. Envolving game where you have to watch the market fluctuation, always striving for a balance between power plants, number of cities powered and resource management. A really good game. Still have to try with just 2 or 3 players.
Some things don't make sense, why the first player is the first to auction power plants, but is the last to buy resources and buy houses?!?

I had this game sitting in my cupboard for well over a year because I just couldn't see my gaming group (My wife, best friend and his wife plus another friend depending on his love life) liking the theme. "Ok, I've got this great game where you buy ... (gulp) power stations and then you buy...fuel to power your.. No hang on, wait a minute, seriously it's very highly regarded on the Geek!" Well I shouldn't have delayed because it was a huge HIT! A super game I would concur with all the positives said about this game.

One of the few heavy games that's just plain FUN to play.

Ennek a játéknak a dobogón van helye! Nagyon letisztult a mechanizmusa, és bár önmagukban a szabályok nem túl komplexek, mégis elég komoly dilmmák elé állítanak végig a játék alatt. Nagyon lassan fut fel a jövedelmünk, szinte mértani pontossággal együtt mozog az egyre drágább erőművek és nyersanyagok árával. Így végig azt érezhetjük, hogy nagyon ki van centizve minden egyes vásárlásunk, a végén pedig nüanszok döntenek. Az már csak a ráadás, hogy a városok bekötése önmagában felér egy operációkutatási feladattal. Mohó játékosoknak gond lehet, hogy nem elég önmagában a legnagyobb kapacitással rendelkeznünk, üzemeltetni is tudnunk kell a döntő pillanatban. 
A szerencse szerepe nem nagy (az új licitálandó elemeknél jelenik meg), a licitek és a térkép miatt elég interaktív a játék. Maga a hangulata nagyon bejön. Bármikor szívesen játszanék vele!

Helyesbítek: a szerencse szerepe igenis nagy tud lenni a licitnél, az új lapka felhúzásánál.

Nice,balanced economic game..2 cons for me are the paper money component (!#&#@#$!&*$#) and the amount of maths involved when you have to decide whether to take that last cheap fuel or will that keep you from expanding in a key town..it might get to the point where this becomes a trivial thing due to the learning curve effect but..

Best game from FF. It has everything I like - planning, resource management and bidding. The resource market implementation is one of the best out there. Every game is full of tension where every $ counts (so better do your math right).

This is a good game, given the right group.  But you really need to play with people of the same skill level -- and definitely NOT with people prone to analysis paralysis.

Games for One's solo variant is a great brain burner. Requires many of the same types of thinking as in a multiplayer game. Allows the AP necessary to play this game well without annoying other players.

Five equally matched players also make for a good evening. The variety possible through different maps and starting from different cities gives this game "replayability."

Solo variant is free of late game destructive luck.

This game is starting to grow on me quite a bit.  For the amount of depth there is in the game, it is pretty simple.  What used to bother me a lot was the jockying for position.  It feels weird that it is more profitable to hold your company back than growing and expanding.  I can forgive Power Grid of this since, it is the only game I have that does this.  I really like the fact that there is no seat position binding.  The game is a bit fiddly but I think they are worth it.  Giving this one more point to 8.

Power Grid is a good game. There's lots of people on BGG saying that it can grow after a number of plays, when one begins to see beyond the simple approach of "I got this sum of money, what can I afford this turn?".
The problem is that, with all these games around to play, I am not sure I will go beyond that threshold...
My few plays so far have been challenging and somewhat interesting, but far from memorable and a little too worklike (and I do enjoy heavy games!!).
Need to explore it better to understand if it can work for me.

I like it less than everyone else I've played it with.  It's not that I don't win - I almost always do.  I just don't think that there are many meaningful decisions per hour; and, very often, the game hinges on a single powerplant draw after a hotly contested auction.

Since I'm very lucky, that's probably in my favor.

Appreciate: the tight balance throughout the entire game (and the turn order mechanics that maintains it); the resource market mechanics that nicely simulates a real supply-demand market; winning is based on the ability to "get it right" in the last round, sometimes leading to unexpected winners; the strategic option of blocking others from getting resources (not so nice when it backfires, thoughs).

Don't appreciate: most decisions are based on exact calculation, leading to a lot of annoying adding all the time.

I enjoy the element of timing in this game, even if it is a little "gamey". It is always a challenge to precisely pick the right time to rapidly expand and yield turn order. Expand too soon, and the loss of priority during building and resource purchasing chokes you. Expand too late, and you don't have enough income to compete during the end game.

Depending on the group you are playing with, the timing of the game can vary significantly. Some groups slowly and evenly play through Phases I, II, and III. Other groups spend several rounds jockeying for position in Phase I before exploding through Phase II and going straight to game end.

Beautiful game with plenty of expansion maps.  Unlike Age of Steam, the rules for each map are only slightly tweaked (with the exception of Korea and China.)  Although I mostly enjoy the original Power Plant Deck, I dislike how the randomness of the power plants can sometimes make or break the game.  Standard Power Grid can get really boring if the end game power plants do not show up until Step 3!  Perhaps the biggest downside to Power Grid is the effort it takes to play the game correctly during each and every step of the game.  More than once have we had to refer back to the rules and/or player aids.  Power Grid is at its best when an experienced player takes care of the Power Plant maintenance.

China is my favorite map.  I love that the beginning plants appear in the same order for each and every game.  I also like that there is 1 less plant than the number of players up for auction.  Bidding is more intense!

Power grid is a game which I always have a good time playing, but I don't propose it very often. I think that's because it is so computational, that it's a bit daunting to think about playing it. 

Overall, Power Grid is a game I can see myself enjoying once in a while for many years to come, but will probably never be a regular.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Since playing this face to face my respect for Power Grid has risen significantly.  There is a lot going on in this game and a great deal to pay attention to as the game progresses.  It is one of those games where you don't want to lead throughout the game, rather sit back in the weeds lurking until it is the right time to strike.  Of course, when everyone else is doing it as well, it makes for some very interesting decisions.

The game is played through three stages and each round has several different goals to complete.  Each round starts with the auctioning of Power Plants, buy resources, connect cities and finally fire plants to earn the cash.  The balance between power and cities, cash and spending, and resources and the renewal of them creates havoc throughtout.

While at first, the decisions and "fiddliness" of this game may overwhelm some at first, but push through the initial stress to find a wonderful game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The combination of auctions, futures market with resources, and strategic play make this a strong favorite. There is plenty math calculations, which means play with a timer!  The theme is interesting and appropiate for the mechanics. I like the classic box art and the board art is adequate. The various maps available are nice, just wish they had a Latin America map.

Gemakkelijke spelregels, doch medium gewicht vanwege lange speeltijd.

Ik speelde de versie "Duitsland" in het Nederlands.

Aandacht:
- Voldoende snel centrales met hogere capaciteit kopen, desnoods door over te bieden.
- Ook voldoende snel huisjes kopen, ookal kan je ze nog niet van stroom voorzien.  Huizen worden duurder naarmate het spel vordert.

The bidding mechanic and market value mechanics in this game are really good.  I also like how the player in last place always has the advantage in the next round.  The only cons I can see so far are game length (a typical game lasts 2-3 hours) and the money/resource management is very tedious.  It seems like you are always having to move pieces around and replace pieces.  Also, the instructions are the most confusing I have ever seen.  About the only way to learn this game is to have someone teach it to you.

I can't think of too many sessions where some set-up quirk wasn't omitted, or some other fiddly little aspect didn't affect the game.  Okay for its time, much better options exist today.  However, the Deluxe Edition does include some convenient reminders printed on the board to reduce the fiddly-ness/rulebook consultations.

RATING: 9
A good game, and I enjoy it a lot, but I can't say I can give it a 9 or a 10.  I like the replayablility aspects (two sides to the board, different regions played, and power plants showing up at different times for bidding), but there can be a level of analysis paralysis and down time, especially when playing with the full compliment of six players.  Maybe playing with fewer players would help. [Christmas Gift]  Update:  After playing a few more times with players that know the game and have developed strategies, the game comes more alive.  I can now upgrade it to a 9 (with the right players!).

RATING: 7
A solid game where you have to weigh the importance of building first, blocking the way, buying resources, becoming the first player, and saving money to win an auction. There is a bit too much number crunching going on, especially in the later turns.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Finally managed to get my hands on this game. Took 2 plays for this game to really click because like any auction game, everyone needs to have an appreciation of the value of the power plants at certain points during the game. The last few plays have been a joy and tense all the way, this game is now one of my favourites and is the game i want to get to the table most atm.

UPDATE: Amazing game, even more so now that my friends and I are becoming more experienced at it. Last game I played was the best yet (I came 2nd tho)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I've been wary about rating this as I was worried that I'm enthralled by the new. The lustre hasn't worn off after 6/7 plays. Reasonably heavy yet easy to teach to intelligent non-gamers, this is just awesome fun.

Update: As much as it keeps the excitement and variation there, the luck of the power plant draw is just too high to make this a perfect 10.

Re-update: Sod it, it's going up to 10. This game just feels perfect in so many ways: the luck factor is spot on, there's just the right level of variation between the maps and expansions (reasonably priced and double sided - more games should copy this), it doesnt always play out identically and it never seems to drag.

Fun game, but lots of little fiddly rules to remember (which can irritate people when you honestly forget them, like I often do), but it's a really good time.  It seems like it can get pretty vicious, depending upon how nasty the players play.  It seems to me that it would get exponentially more cruel with each player you add to the game.  I'm very much looking forward to my next playing of this.

***UPDATE*** 
Just played first game with 5 people.  The board really fills up quick, but it also seems that the steps progress quicker, too, so it's not like people get completely bitchslapped by getting trapped by other players.

The end of the game still seems kind of unsatisfying.  Games seem to end "not with a bang, but a whimper."  We think that by making the money closed information, that this will help make the games more exciting.  If nobody knows how much money people have, someone is less likely to storm through and go crazy by building cities right at the end to prematurely end the game.

****UPDATE*****
After playing this game with hidden money, I'll never play any other way.  Makes the end-game vastly more exciting and fun.  This game is a lot of fun: requires constant involvement by all players, which is great.

[i]Posted: 9/26/05, Rated: 9[/i]
{2P: ?, 3P: ?, 4P: 9, 5P: ?, 6P: ?}

I tried several times to read through the rules, but just couldn't make heads or tails out of them.  Deciding to forge ahead, I got a couple of games in with some friends of mine, and experienced that "aha!" moment as the rules fell into place.

I sat in wonder as I watched the commodity markets rise and fall.  I struggled to find the "perfect bid" to either buy a power plant, or to make its cost of acquisition dear enough to an opponent to preclude him from trumping my bid and also being able to connect to another city.  Hoarding resources in an unused power plant just to suck money away from my competition by forcing them to buy at a higher cost.  Using city placement as a weapon for map control.

[i]Power Grid[/i] is a lot of fun to play.  I'll dock it one point for the constant need to recalculate connection and resource costs that really bogs down the auction phase.  I am eagerly awaiting my next opportunity to play!


[i]Refreshed: 5/19/15, Rated: 9[/i]

Perhaps I should have waited the full ten years before revisiting this score, but I recently played [thing=155873]the deluxe version[/thing] and wanted to update my comments here while the memory is fresh.

The formula still works after all this time.  I think the greatest testament to the game is that the theme just works: when I look at the board after completing a game, a critical eye wonders if this is some sort of area control game like [i][thing=491][/thing][/i]/[i][thing=18100][/thing][/i] (it isn't), or else a "chain game" like [i][thing=475][/thing][/i] (it isn't that, either).  The theme is so well integrated that I can't deconstruct it into various mechanics: I feel like I just managed a power company and enjoyed every minute of it.

Calculating acceptable auction prices gets easier with practice.  I still agree with a rating of "9," although my reason for withholding that final point has changed.  The interaction between the power plant market and the "steps" in the game is fiddly.  When the game is cruising it is seamless, but then there's this jarring aspect of trying to remember what to do when advancing to the next step.  It is easy to forget things, and I don't like game results with asterisks due to misplayed rules.

Wow this feels dry to me. Actually love the look, but coming to game-play its a bunch of route building. I dunno - haven't played it for 6+ months, but will need to get back to it for a clearer verdict. Haven't introduced this to the current game group.

Yep - dry,dry,dry. Game provides the same repeated pattern. Once you figure out a map, there's not much variety after that - no wonder there's gobs of maps. Would like a game with repeated plays that provides continued interest with the same core components. This doesn't do it for me.

It took a long time for me to finally play this modern day classic. It lived up to the hype. I enjoy the auctions and the way the energy market works and fluctuates. I always enjoy games where you build a route/network. The game works best with three plus. The fact that there are so many maps means the re-playability is endless. The graphic design isn't anything fancy and some of the maps could be a little clearer, but I think it is appropriate. There is quite a bit of strategy involved as to when you want to be in first place versus last place as it effects your turn order for certain actions. Also, it can be quite cutthroat if you so desire. My only disappointment with the game personally is that it doesn't play well at 2 players. Robot expansion doesn't help with this enough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very tight economic game. The theme is interesting and the graphics and bits are good. Would probably have rated it higher if you didn't need a math degree to win. I feel my math degree makes it easier for me to determine the correct amount to bid on a given plant while leaving enough for resource purchase advantage.

I'm lucky my wife enjoys the theme although she hasn't won yet (due to my calculating the numbers better).

If it weren't for this one issue, I would probably have rated it a 9.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
(2-6 Players, 120 min, CLASSIC) The bestselling game about running an energy company. The rules are simple: invest in emerging power plant technologies at auction (both fossil fuels and renewable alternatives), buy fuel resources on the open market, then pay for infrastructure to extend your coverage to as many cities as possible, earning more revenues with each connection. The key is doing so better than your competitors. Contains dozens of country maps and optional variations.

RATING: 6
Power Grid is in some ways a great game, yet in other ways plagued by (what I view as) design problems. As an economist, I will start by saying that the resource market is great. The price mechanism integrating supply and demand is wonderful (even if abstracted a bit, as it must be), and the implementation works quite well, especially when combined with the ability to purchase and store excess resources to drive up the price or monopolize a specific resource to keep prices low. This is without a doubt my favorite part of the game. However, many aspects of the game feel a bit contrived: turn order [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_game_difficulty_balancing#Approaches]rubber-banding[/url], the different 'steps', continual upkeep and management, etc. As a result, the game feels like a bit of a chore to play at times. The very mechanical/mathematical nature of the game does not help it feel very [i]natural[/i] (see [gameid=171], [gameid=42], etc.), and the turn order mechanism (upon which so much depends) introduces a strange 'competition for last place' that I'm not fond of (even though I recognize that it is indeed a strongly competitive element, which I appreciate). The end of the game almost always feels anti-climactic and obvious (if one player has obtained enough of a lead), or seems to depend heavily on the final power plant auction (which often makes or breaks a player's game). Power Grid offers some interesting strategic play, but ultimately I find the experience to be more oppressive (due mathematical nature of the game) and somewhat artificial (due to the rubber-banding, which shifts the focus from 'normal' competition to jockeying for worse positions) than enjoyable.

There are so many issues that I have found with the game (game length, mechanics that result in overly close games often with a need of tie breakers, tons of calculations required at end game, lack of a proper resolution) that often left me with a bad taste in my mouth.

This is a fine game but I don't quite get the high ratings. I do appreciate how this game blends unique mechanics and the auctions can create some interesting situations. However, the game is fiddly, the auctions often come down to nickel-and-diming opponents which drags, and the ending could easily be anticlimactic if you pay attention. Like I said, it's fine and I'm happy to play if the mood is right but definitely not one of my top games.

first time played at Game days with Great new friends of mine, I will say they make ANY game a full point better, but I have not added it in this score as I want it to reflect those who do not have access to my friends to play! Anyway, this one is a rare treasure, multiple layers of strategy, and fun all rolled into one, buy, provide, profit and then repeat, all the while your rival power companies do the same thing. 

The beautiful maps are interesting BEFORE you play and even more so after, that there are layers and layers of rules that can and are added via expansion that add to the overall game without being cumbersome. The layers of what to do when add up quickly, and the astute player IS in fact planning several moves for each move, in their down time. The mechanics this one teaches about supply and demand also is a marvelous teaching tool and will call me to bring young ones to this decidedly heady table, if they get it, then they are going learn a lot and enjoy themselves immensely.

If you were avoiding this one, like I have been (I knew I would fall in love with it, and have to have them all..) STOP it and go play now. Then buy a copy, and the expansions...and just get it out of the way!

It has the illusion of depth, but in fact the randomness of the power plants both shapes the game and makes real planning irrelevant.  Granted, this same randomness gives the game shelf life as each game is slightly different, but bottom line is your fate is not in your own hands.  I did think quite highly of this game, but shine is wearing (or worn) off.  Holy cats!, at the time I wrote this I had logged 37 plays....  In my mind, right now this game is the poster-child for "overrated".

Nice game.  Initial phases are an economic game (return on investment), but it becomes increasingly interactive with the other players as it gets closer to the end. A tad on the long side (starts to feel a bit repetitious near the end).

Upgraded the rating after playing with 6 players.  Was surprised how well it worked and it felt less repetitious than with 3.

I very much enjoy this game, but the set up and round maintenance is really irritating.  I love this game when I play it often, but if I let it sit on the shelf too long, I have to review how the thing sets up, which is a pain since the rules are written so poorly.  It, with Betrayal an the House on the Hill, are by far the two most finicky games I own.

Played this game with three. Actually really enjoyed this game.  Took a bit to figure out how the turn sequences flowed, and realized the importance of building cities vs. powering all of your cities.  Looking forward to getting this game to the table again.  Maybe with more people to make the auction dynamic more important.

Aika monsteri peli. Suhteettoman paljon odottelua kaikenkaikkiaan. Pahin tilanne on tietty jos itte on ekana huutamas ja passaa, jolloin joutuu odotteleen muitten huutelut, ja muitten rakentelut ennenku itte pääsee bykään. Ja jos on peli ei oikeen kulje, voi olla suht tuskasta. Kuitenkin kestoa pelillä riittää. No, tuosta huolimatta ihan hyvä peli kysessä. Silloin tällöin kyllä pelaan, mutta kestosta ja etenkin odotelusta johtuen ei suurta hinkua pelin pariin yleensä ole. (17.3.2009)

Power Grid was one of the first games I became interested in, even before discovering BGG, and now that I have it, I have to say it's an extremely nice game.

The rules are quite simple, but there are many decisions, and not really any obvious one, so you have to think your way through the game, struggle to find not only the best option for the next move that also improves your overall position in the game, which is something I enjoy a lot.

It has quite a lot of tension and is extremely interactive. It is a bit dry with 3 players (I have yet to try The Robots), but 4+ people is great, everything fits together and makes a fantastic game that flows smoothly.

The gameboard has some nice Steampunk-like feel to it. Some people may argue that the art is not great, but I like it :P

It feels incredibly replayable, and the extra maps will probably make it a game I won't tire of for years.

Great 4-5 player game. 6 players are good, but 2-3 player games are far from good (The Robots improve this a bit but don't expect miracles)

My box holds:
-Base Game
-The New Plants
-The Robots
-150 Poker Chips (40x1$ - 35x5$ - 35x10$ - 40x25$)

i like how the 1st person can change because of the power plant you get, the amount of house's you have, the money you have, and the house's you power. it can seem much for, just figuring out just to see who goes first but i like it. i just can't win it, i always get second.

RATING: 7
Fun economic game about running a power company. There is a luck element in the power plants tile that can be auctioned. Apart this is all about money management and decisions. A middleweight that needs a little math to optimize replenishment/line expansion option. One of the few germans to be played with 6 players.
My main critic is that it seems there is just one strategy. The game is about tactic: how to well implement that way to win

This is a fantastic game.  It seems a bit daunting at first, but once you get into it, it's a rather simple game to play.  But you need to stay agressive to compete long term.  It is a little bit fiddly with all of the different end of turn actions you need to perform, and the special things that happen during stage changes.  Also, the rules leave a fair number of things pretty ambiguous.  This can all be overcome with a little research however.

Almost a perfect game. I was and still am so enamored with the supply and demand mechanism.  It was just such a breath of fresh air.  After several plays with different groups of people, I am now a bit more reluctant to pull this out though just because of the length of play which can get to 2 hours or more depending on how much analysis players are doing.

A game that is over the top euro. Uses the rich get richer mechanic which really makes players cringe. The catchup mechanism, you get stuff cheaper. That doesn't do much when your opponents have fifty more elektros than you but only have to pay five extra for some coal. Still a good game to play to learn German geography I guess.

Amazingly balanced and strategic game. Nail biting the whole way through. Can be mentally exhausting and the last couple of rounds go a lot easier with pen and paper.

Well designed game which depends on players competing for power plants (auctioning), hoarding resources, and strategically placing their networks to block, trap, or dominate the board. Once my family gets the hang of doing these three things (not much cutthroat action) I'm sure I will have more fun.

Very original network building game. The market is done extremely well and the balancing mechanisms work like a charm. There is always a tradeof between earning more money and keeping your costs in check. The only downside is that towards the endgame it can become very mathy and thus drag out for too long.

I like the theme and most of the mechanisms that drive the game, but I feel like its a bit too long and the learning curve seems a bit too large.  Besides that I think it has too much counting in it to appeal to non-gamers I might want to introduce it to.  So '8' will probably be as high as it goes.
*Update* Re-read the rating descriptions... and since I rarely feel like spending four hours of my life on this on I have to lower it to a six plus one (for theme and mechanics)

Well, it finally happened. 5 years on my unplayed list and now out of my collection. Whoa, hold on, put down the torches and pitchforks. There is a lot to like in this game. I find the balancing act of managing your finances to be quite interesting. It takes some serious planning, and advance planning games are some of my favorites. There's a ton to think about in this game, and I imagine it will play out differently each time. The downfall for me is just that the game wasn't particularly exciting. If the game was a little shorter it might have kept me enthralled throughout, or maybe if it had a more engaging theme. I also suspect that the game could be a bit too punishing if a player makes a bad move early (it basically tells you this in the rules.) So I'd definitely be on board playing again if someone were to ask, but it won't work for my family so there's no need to store it on my shelf.

After many years of being in the hobby, somehow this game had evaded me. When I finally got to play Power Grid it did not disappoint. The auctions, resource management, network building and timing decisions fit together to make a smooth and challenging game. I see how some people say it's mathy, but if you add the cities first and then the routes it makes it much more palatable. 

About the only negative thing that I could think of is that it took me so long to get it to the table. This game appeals to my sensibilities.

I found a couple of mechanisms in the game interesting:
- You have to be very sensitive to how the market is going.
- You must be follow how others are doing and what strategy they are using, this is not one of those games where you can just use a strategy you like through the whole game but adjust it according to other players moves constantly. 

I found a couple of mechanisms especially fun:
- The bidding for power plants and randomness of what cards you could bid for. 
- The turn system. I had been warned that I should try not to be in the lead but last or middle for the most part of the game, and this feels like a more important aspect than I first imagined. 

So this game is fun, does remind me a tinsy tiny bit of Ticket to ride, it's just more advanced. And because of the fluctuation of the market and turn order it felt like we were all on a trampoline trying to catch desired objects in mid air. If you are calculating enough and find the rhythm of the game you start to bounce at the right force so you'll get important stuff before others. You can't just go full force with all you got but hold your horses until the time is right and then hammer in that victory! Huzzah for Power grid!

P.s. the reason for the 6 score is the long gameplay and a bit of a clunky feeling when playing, experienced players needed to hold onto the rule book like dear life. Maybe after a couple of plays it will go more smoothly and then I'll adjust the score accordingly.

Have only had the chance to play this once, and the game was a lot of fun.  There is a ton of player interaction (that auction phase is always a blast), and the fact that the last place player gets a lot of benefits is a very nice balance.  We found an issue with our 3-player game was the bidding wasn't as competitive as it should have been, but this might also be due to player inexperience.  Also, the paper money is a huge pain in the neck; we switched to pen-and-paper to keep track of money halfway through.  I definitely want to play this a lot more; rating may go up.

Balance!

Our team loves Power Grid! Map may look complicated on first blush but becomes second nature after a few plays.

Lots of suspense in play due to the auction system for power plants. What we love most about this game is how difficult it is for any single player to gain a dominant advantage.

Most games are so well balanced, that no clear winner can be forecast until the final round is played out, the sign of excellent design!

We highly recommend for both hardcore and casual gamers alike!

Well balanced and clever (economic simulation) game.
It is entertaining and educational at the same time. 

Buy power plants and the respective resources to power it, in order to maintain energy in the cities you have a "station".
It is all about managing your income, resources and of course your power plants.

I like the balance factor a lot, which makes it thrilling until the end.

Power Grid is a superb resource management game. The game mechanics may be confusing at first, but its actually not that hard to get the ball rolling. This game is one of my favourites, and time flies while playing it, which is good, because some sessions can take up to several hours.

My favorite auction/bdding game. If one of your opponents is "Good Will Hunting" then you won't stand a chance.  Power Grid is an amazing game for an Economics graduate.  The law of diminishing returns is for ever at the fore front of any strategy.  Amazinging game.  I do not share the negative comment that this game is dry.  Those that think this game is dry are unimaginative and basically need strap-ons props to be able to perform at anything.  Power Grid is exciting, challenging, and requires careful planning.

Condenses everything you're likely to forget onto play summary cards. (two cards per page; four cards for each player configuration, plus a small general rules card) Simply read the card for your number of players and the current Step of the game, and you'll never again forget to remove a plant, or how many coal to restock - and you'll never misinform and frustrate new players.  I never play without this.

This game is ABSOLUTELY awesome. I will always enjoy playing. The versatility of the continuous change in prices of the materials is remarkable.
The auction system of power plants adds a tabletalk element to the game as well, which is always healthy in games. There is an awesome strategy about the turn order, which changes each turn. This determines who gets to buy the resources first, the cheapest ones, and the last of the resources, which is usually very expensive, etc.

If you are just a beginner to board games, wait a while before purchasing as the rules are a little complex, but not bad so you have to check the book every round. For people who have read this game to be mathy, it really just is basic maths of adding simple numbers together. If you can add 7+10 you will be fine.

RATING: 7
Pro's:

1) The slow ramp up as your energy company grows, becomes richer and powers more homes feels very satisfying.
2) The game is surprisingly accessible despite it being relatively heavy. Even though it is quite maths heavy, all the elements flow very well together and everything makes sense.
3) The commodities market and how it interacts with your strategy. 
4) Naming your energy companies and making fun of your opponent for causing brown outs is worth the price of the game alone.
5) New players will often analyse why they did or did not win in depth. Coming up with alternatives of how to prevent this issue in the future.

Con's:

1) Paper money. First time I have ever felt the need to upgrade a game's components.
2) The tightness of the maths can be punishing. Minor miscalculation can be the difference between winning and losing though this is arguably also a strength of the game.
3) Some of the smaller rules are not made obvious enough to the point where you will entirely forget them.
4) Despite it being far from the heaviest game I own, it is one that I want the longest break from between plays.

This game may be the closest thing to a perfect game I have found in terms of rules and mechanics. Each expansion just makes it better too. Wish it were more visually appealing as it does turn off new players before you even start. If you can get them to play through, they are sold.

the gameplay is not bad, although a perhaps too simple and repetitive. but the ending is really bad, maybe because I do not like games where the players decide the end of the game (puerto rico is different because at the end there is, however, the calculation of points, so it is said that he who closes the game is also the winner), power grid is rather predictable and de-energized!

I like his game and have played many times, but truly haven't been able to make the end of the game the way I'd like.  So far it's come down to one player becoming so wealthy they can buy any plant, city combo, and as many resources as they need. Whomever can do all three on one of their last turns basically wins. It's a very anticlimactic ending.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I love almost everything about this game -- so much so that it's easier to list the things I don't like than the things I do.

Most importantly, the pacing feels off to me: the end always comes in a rush of building 6-8 cities all at once, which is completely at odds with the way the rest of the game proceeds.

Secondarily, there is the, "Oops, I got the only 5-capacity plant that's going to come up in the first half of the game at cost because I happened to be auctioning last on that one particular turn" phenomenon.  Admittedly it doesn't happen often, but when it does, the game ends on the spot.

Would be a 10 if these were fixed.  Probably the game mechanics don't allow the second issue to be fixed, but it's possible that increasing the penalty for being 2nd/3rd in a city and/or decreasing further the marginal utility of powering an additional city in the payoff chart could fix the pacing for me.

Very well thought through game. No balance issues or anything like that, and I really enjoy playing it, but it is too much "euro" for me to give it a higher rating than 8.

Edit: Lowered to 7. I recognize that the design is brilliant, but the game is not that fun for me. Requires too  much planning I think, I prefer slightly lighter games with more randomness in them

RATING: 9
A great, nicely balanced euro with ample opportunities for interaction and screwage. Timing is everything. You really need to make that sprint for the line at the optimum point because, after a steady start, the end always comes earlier than you think.

My only slight criticism is that it always seems a little fiddly. The upkeep of the resources, counting the cash, handling the houses, the little rules that change in the different steps (and you always seem to forget one). A minor criticism of a great game.

RATING: 5
There’s nothing compelling in Power Grid, which is just your typical boring euro with a repulsive theme pasted on and a bunch of annoying rules: when you start playing you already know you’ll be continually facing silly hindrances whose only aim is preventing you from truly enjoy the game, such as the limit to the owned plants set to three and the ban to buy as many resources as you wish do. (December 2012)

[b]Update[/b] - How come could I rate Power Grid a 6? It ain’t any better than Agricola and the lot, which means a 5 is way more fitting: thus, rating degraded from 6 to 5 in May 2014.

This is a great game.  I've taught it to non-gamers, and they've loved it.

I recognize this is a good game, so I gave it a 7.  However, it just isn't my kind of game.  I don't really enjoy playing it--not a fun game for me and I can't really put my finger on why that is.  Oh, well.

A very good game. No dice so it's not avery luck oriented game. It is odd because being ahead is a dissadvantage most of the game. Most people need to see an example round or 2 played to get the rules.  If you're not good at math have a calculator.  The different boards and expansion cards make this one of my top 5.

RATING: 5
I like the way the game plays out.  The sum is quite long for me to want to play often, but I like each of the individual parts of it.

Except the auction, that just kills me. There are so many variables to think about with your bid: keeping enough money to expand or buy resources; how valuable/plentiful the matching resources will be; how the plant's number will affect turn order; whether you can win with this plant or whether you will need to replace it again later; and consider all of these same variables for the person you're bidding against, too.

Plus you have to be aware of the different Steps and their significance, why you might want to expand and when. This is far from intuitive. If I'm building up normally, and at some point the game says, "OK, you're now into the next Step" and it's a surprise to all, that'd work for me. But when people know it's coming, and it's a HUGE deal when it happens, experienced gamers change their behaviour and [i]play against theme[/i] and do things that don't make sense thematically, like doing their damnedest to be last so they get first pick of the new building sites I guess. Wanting to be last at one point and first at another completely arbitrary point makes absolutely no sense thematically and makes it too "gamey" -- i.e. a collection of weird rules that lose all connection with theme and so cannot be easily intuited. (A shame, because the theming is otherwise so strong here.)

You could ignore all that stuff and wing it (and I do), but it means experienced players will pummel you. Knowing the rules aren't enough -- winning strategies depend on the subtle understanding of the game's many tiny rough edges and rule oddities and their unintuitive significance.

So, I don't know. It's very close to being a very good game for me, but it would need all those rough edges cleaned up and be a more elegant game. And then it wouldn't be Power Grid any more, so I don't know that anyone else would like it. First Sparks was good, and look forward to seeing more in that direction.

2011: After one play, I understand the hype. Clearly-defined start, middle and endgame, scaling resources, good market mechanic. Despite the inclusion of an auction mechanic (which I usually hate), I still like this game!

2017: Played again with new people, definitely enjoyed it again. It's never going to be my go-to, but it definitely falls in the "will happly agree to it if someone else suggests it in the interests of getting to play what I want to play later, with the added bonus of actually enjoyign it" camp.

Game is growing on me.  Have to want to play this type of game, but I am digging it a bit more now.

Update:  game made my head hurt.  lol.  A lot of money analysis goes on to do well.  Really gotta make your plant purchases and upgrades give you bang for the buck.  Some luck comes into play when you can get a plant, at cost.  Finally came upon the idea of really watching what others are doing, their choices of plants and how it's affecting the market.  Yes, I finally won a game of this.  :)  It's not a game I can play every week, but one I will enjoy every so often.

I recognize that Power Grid is an incredibly well designed game, with each aspect (the futures market for power plants, the changing supplies of the fuel bank, the asymmetrical maps) adding to the tension and the challenge. It's a wonderfully well oiled machine. But, after every time I've played it, I'm not exactly sure if I've had fun. I don't know what that says about me, but I decided that perhaps someone else would enjoy it more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Wonderful simulation of supply/demand mechanics in a changing environment. At the heart of the game is the auction for power plants and this is where the game really shines: you can glimpse what the future has on offer but you can never really be certain that the next plant on offer will be the one you want.

As one part of the fuel market becomes crowded, players are rewarded if they diversify, but will the reward balance the investment in different technology? Add to this the first mover advantage on infrastructure and you have a game that will force you to consider a complex array of costs and benefits but without particularly complex rules.

On a sidenote, the rulebook is very poorly put together which makes learning the rules an effort in spite of their simplicity. It should also be added that a lot of people find this game rather dry.

RATING: 7
If the end game didn't almost require a calculator, this would be a 9 or 10.  The complexity of the last turn or two means that accurate planning is nearly impossible, which is sort of a good thing.  Mostly I just get a headache.  My impression may be colored somewhat by the fact that I've never pulled off a win.

The complaint that the game is 'clunky' or is just a mishmash of mechanics is somewhat accurate - there is no real justification for the game phases or the "Phase 3" card other than as an arbitrary way to move the game along.  That said, it still works, and the game IS fun.  My only wish would be to figure out a way to remove the power plant auction - somehow, the auction in this game just doesn't do it for me.  Maybe I'm getting tired of auctions.

RATING: 8
Power grid is a game entirely filled with strategic thinking, planning, and very little luck. It's a very fun game if you're looking for a game of cold calculations. 

There's only one area of the game where chance is involved at all but it's used very well. Power grid also has a great mechanic to balance the players that are doing well so it's almost impossible to take an early lead and run away with the game. You can maintain a lead the whole game and win, it's just hard. 

2 hours, possibly more depending on number of people and how fast people can go. Don't play with indecisive people. 

Expansions add in new maps or new sets of power plants

Got this from my 2009 SS.  I like this game but I'm not exactly sure why.  I think it's because there is a nice combination of strategy with auctioning and the game is pretty balanced.  This is not a simple game to learn.  Newbies will find themselves struggling to win their first few games if they make the wrong choices.  This is definitely a game which should be played in stages so as not to frustrate new players.

I purchased this game on a whim several months ago, and my 4 player group finally picked it to play. We all enjoyed it and had a great time; I would recommend this game. We got some of the mechanics wrong at first, and we actually played all the regions on the map, but the game still played great. I have since read the Power Grid FAQ here in the file section and it cleared up any questions I had left. I understand that there are expansions, however, this main game is a winner.

// This is a rare game that gives me the ability to try
different things and still be more or less OK with losing
each time. There's flexibility with how many resources to
buy, what plants to bid on, what cities to expand to... and
I know there's also pretty much always an optimal path for 
doing those things, but the path isn't always clear to me.
It's more fun to try different things and see what works.

Still feels different to anything else out there (Factory Manager etc notwithstanding). It's inelegant, but that fits.

Got this from B&N at 75% off.  What a steal?!  It sat on the shelf for about 4 months, because the kids were not interested...probably due to the boring cover art.  I watched Rhado run through this one, and was convinced to get the Robots expansion, even before our first play.  The game reminds me of monopoly, but only in that you are buying "houses" with paper money. We really enjoyed our first play and I'm hoping this becomes a family favorite.

Takes some math skills, but it's a lot deeper and a lot more fun than monopoly.   update, no one will play this with me...argh!

2017- no plays since 2014. boooooo

This is an excellent introduction to heavy strategy boardgame. You need to manage your money tight and to buy your plants only when necessary (and for resources that are not short in supply) if you want to win! A must have.

Awesome game.  Theme & gameplay go hand-in-hand.  There are auctions for power plants, but the auctions are only about 1/3 of the game.  Initially, the ending didn't feel right... but once you get the swing of the game phases & game end, this game is fantastic.  Possibly want 2nd copy.

This is a very well-balanced game, and you can feel it while you play. Every game we've played has been too close to call right up to the end, and every decision is important. It's a little longer than some Euros, but it's so enjoyable you hardly notice. Usually, games that are too "well-balanced" really annoy me (*cough* Caylus) because they frustrate the crap out of me. Not so with Power Grid. Over time, rating dropped from 9 to 8 as it's not made it to the table as often I think this is due to length of play & setup time (and rules explanations). Still enjoy it, though.

Power Grid Base Game
Objective
To build largest network of Power Grid in the country and be able to supply power to the cities
In the game, players will bid to acquire Power Plant
Then they will build their network (represented by the 3 spots on the cities)
Purchase raw materials to power up your power plant.
Coal, Oil, Garbage and Uranium.
You will need the required amount of resource to power up your power plant and the number next to the house represent how many cities you can power.
Hybrid plant
Green power plant (does not require to use resource)
Finally you gain money in the form of Elektro based on how many cities you have powered

THINGS I FORGOT:
In the first round, player order will be re-determined based on the number of power plant.
Remove ONCE the lowest number power plant when Step 2 is triggered.
In Bureaucracy phase during Step 3, remove the lowest number power plant.
At the beginning, player do not need to choose starting city


Throughout the game each player will have a maximum of three power plant.
When you first build your grid network, you place your house on the $10 spot and pay the amount. Then the next player who want to come into the city will have to place on $15 spot and the third on the $20.  However, can only place on $15 during Step 2 and $20 during Step 3 which I explained later.  If you wish to expand you need to pay additional based on the channel cost.

When you acquire resource, you will always buy from the left side.  The more resources are taken, the more expensive it gets for the later player to purchase.  You can buy more than what you need to power up and keep the additional resource based on the number indicated on the power plant.  Show examples.  So this means you can buy more, hoard the resource, and make it expensive for other players to buy.

Lets go through the different phases of play.  Refer to your player aid.
Set Up

Player Order
In the game, player order meaning who goes first, second and so on will be determine by how many cities you have established your power grid..
If tie, look at who has the power plant with the highest number.  Show example.
So each time you build a grid on a city, move your house on this track

Auction

First player will choose 1 power plant to bid and go clockwise.  You must always make a bid that you can pay.  No loan.  There are two markets - the ready market and the future market.
Once a player win the bid.  He takes the plant and cannot enter the bid again.
If the player who choose the power plant did not get the power plant, he can choose another power plant from the ready market to bid again.
You can buy a power plant with capacity higher than the number of cities you have grid on.
Rearrange the power plant.


If in the later round, no one bid for any power plant.  The lowest number will be discarded and a new one will be drawn.

Resource
In REVERSE ORDER player will buy the resources.

Building
In REVERSE ORDER, player will build their grids

ADDITIONAL RULE
Whenever there is a power plant with the number equal to or less than the number of city player has, the power plant will be removed from the game.  Don't want that power plant to clog up the market.
You cannot have more than 1 house in the same city.

Bureaucracy (Earn Income)
Player determined how many cities they want to power up and spend the number of required resources to do so.
Look at the table to determine who much you have earned.
Refilled/replenished/resupply - look at the table.
Update power plant, place the highest number of power into the bottom of the stack and draw a new one.

STEP 1
STEP 2 - trigger when a player build his 7th city. There can be more than one player to do so.  So in the next round ONLY, player can build the grid on the city on $15.
STEP 3 - step 3 card is revealed.  Remove Step 3 card and the lowest number power plant from the game.  Do not draw replacement.  Shuffle draw stack with the remaining power plant.  Step 3, 6 power plants will be made available in the ready (actual) market.  There will be no future market.

When the game ends, look at the table.
In the game, you do not win based on how many power grid you build on cities, you win based on how many cities you can power up.
But ff tie, players with the most money wins.

I've played this game quite a bit, I loved it at first but I don't really enjoy it that much anymore.

I don't find the jockeying for the best Power Plants to be that interesting and the end game where multiple are threatening to build the last 2-3 plants in one turn seems boring.   Especially since it requires so much addition.

Excellent game based on three plays, one 5 player, two 6 player. Can be long with 6 inexperienced players. 

Upside is the thematic flow of the game makes it easy to understand after a turn or two. Also there's a great sense of reward getting paid at the end of your turn which keeps you going throughout.

Downside is a great deal of fiddly bookkeeping especially regarding the power plant available for auction and, as above, can be a little long. Mostly due to people try to figure out all the math involved in their moves.

Overall a great game.

Very dry and caclulate-heavy. The bidding mechanism is what drives this game and adds the fun, because without that, it would be an absolute drag. But don't forget the timing. It's so important to get the player order right. I like that it's a race instead of a VP match.

You really can get screwed sometimes  because: 
1) A decent power plant doesn't come along in time.
2) You feel pressed to take a sub-optimal power plant and your closest opponent topdecks the perfect one for him/herself.

This game has the reputation of being hard to learn. My experience contradicts this. The flow is easy to follow and the theme really helps. I do play this game with poker chips making the money less fiddly (but more traceable).

In my opinion this game really deserves it high user rating. The market simulation is really brilliant and the constant search for optimum power plants to fit the urge to expand makes the game really exciting.

5 plays: 

I really enjoy playing this game. But other people I play games with don't love it like I do. The resource supply feels very fiddly to me -- I hate looking up numbers in a chart, which feels clunky and inelegant, and takes focus from the gameplay. 

There is definite analysis paralysis in the endgame. 

The player order thing feels so randomly imposed. 

Love the auction mechanic, including ability to inflate the price of a plant and dump it on someone else. Don't love the map stuff -- it feels so arbitrary where you begin, since you'd probably do better if you paralyzed yourself and did tons of analysis...

Still, somehow I do just *love* it. Switching strategies, cutting a player off -- there's a lot you can do here, and the mechanics are definitely not fiddly.

Although I think it's a huge weakness of the design that there are so many values you must look up based on the number of players.

Great game where most of the strategy is deciding when to go full force and when to hold back.  Usually players feel like they are doing okay throughout the game, but the weaker strategic players get noticeably outclassed in the final two rounds.  Pressing your luck when passing on certain power plants or deciding whether to try clog other player's resources adds a lot of small intricacies in both strategy and tiny randomness.

I may be a bit biased as I work in the utilities industry and one of the first applications I supported was also called Power Grid but this is a really great game.  The mechanics are interesting and basically simulates generation, transmission and distribution concepts.  The auction and the resource markets are a standout for the game.  The only drawback I see is near or at the end of the game where players usually collude and play king maker against the perceived leader.  This game is not good for people with analysis paralysis and will extend the game well beyond the estimated 2 hrs playtime.

Still a classic.  While I do find the power plant market can be a little swingy, I feel that it is a good sort of mitigatible luck that one can plan around.

The resource market implementation is a great idea, and captures that element perfectly.  And I love the competition on three fronts for territory, equipment, and supplies.

This is a quite mathy game that I can occasionally get burned out on, but most of the time it's just a good, deep, strategic game.

RATING: 8
Networking game (could have been a rail game), with a decent economic engine, that is driven by the auction for gradually emerging power plants (which supply power to your expanding network of cities). The number of "powered" cities will determine your income level which in turn determines your ability to compete in the auctions for new power plants and to purchase the fuel you need to power your generators. The person with the largest powered network when the game ending condition is met wins.

It all hangs together with the usual elegance of a well-designed Euro. You have to be a particular fan of auction type games to enjoy this fully. I don't mind them, but there are game genres I like better. The game is very much affected by the random way the power plants emerge combined with player order, but a lot of Euros have similar features and fans don't seem bothered by such things - my rating is more a recognition of the game's polished design than my love for it...
++++++
After a considerable hiatus we returned to the game to introduce a new player to it and I was again struck at the elegant design. The auction is an important element - in fact perhaps the key one and I prefer other devices. Still...

Гениальная игра. Она бы получила более высокую оценку, но мы ее "заиграли" - в течении полугода  хотя бы раз в неделю собирались компанией сыграть две-три партии. Мужчина на коробке мне как родной. Нравится, что она удовлетворяет потребности игроков разного типа - для стратегов - долговременное планирование, для любителей "живого человеческого общение" - аукцион заводов, для градостроителей - ставь себе домики, осваивай новые территории. А какие страсти кипят на последних ходах при покупке ресурсов! (особенно если минимум два игрока сидят к концу игры на угле).

RATING: 5
Just my sort of game - bit of bidding, bit of player interaction, lot of planning and a little bit of hidden information (power plants). Currently one of my favourites - interesting to see if it holds up to repeated plays - if it doesn't the rating will fall

** Update, well it has (down from 9 to 8), not played it for a while and I've stopped actively looking to play it. Why? Not sure, I think my enjoyment depends on the map and the powerplant deck - sometimes the game gets a 'stagnation' phase where no-one wants the powerplants, and that gives an advantage to the players with the best plants at that point. Sure the others need to do something, but why take the hit and buy a sub-optimal plant to help the others? Because of this rating has dropped a bit.

*** Update, Played it again after a long while - and definitely felt less 'wow' then when I first played. It's ok, but I now feel a bit frustrated by the 'hang just behind the leader until you want to sprint for the finish' feeling ... and the random element of the powerplants which really impacts the game. Seems to reward cautious play, rating reduced, now up for trade ...

So ya wanna manage the power supply to Germany..(or some other country...whoa be to them...)
Fun game! This game is simply amazing as to how well balanced it is.  It seems to take about 80-90 minutes with a friendly competative feel to the game.  It can be very intense however with competition between players for more efficent power plants, placement of plants (based on cheaper connections), and lastly for resources.  

With the right people you can really have a heavy game on your hands penny pinching the nearest cent.  I like how you really have to watch spending down to the 2-3 dollar range.  The end of the game can be an utter shock when triggered and end up being just so very close between mulitple players.

The map of Germany seems a touch longer than others.

I've played a two person game one time and only one time and I believe that it is fine with two however it lacks some of the shoulder rubbing that can makes gaming seem more exciting.

Its sweet spot is 4 people I believe.

Recently downgraded after a few very unsatisfying games.  It all comes down to the plants you get.  You really have to know the deck of plant cards to do well in the auction phase.  But even so, the plant market gets bogged down too often with junk plants.  Nothing good when it's your turn?  Pass and watch a player take a mediocre plant and the next player grabs a plant that ups his capacity by four or five unchallenged.  This is how most of the winners are decided in my games.

Fairly simple mechanics but they combine for a lot of depth, a little long- so the game feels maybe a bit heavier than the rules would make it seem.

I know it says 2 hours to play, but it honestly can't be that long. Time seems to fly when building power monopolies.

It is a little fiddly, but it doesn't bother me as much as it would in other games. It seems to fit the theme.

I typically don't like auction games, but it doesn't "feel" like an auction game. 

Probably the best designed game I've ever played.

The first time I played this game I was hooked.  I've only had the chance to play it once since I got it but I enjoyed the second game as much as the first.  It's easy to teach but still has enough strategy to make it interesting.  Great second-level gateway game.

Have played this a bunch more times and I love it more each time.  I'll pick this game over most others.

Great euro game.  I'm always fascinated by the supply and demand resource mechanic every game.  Has an almost TTR feel to the map (good thing).  New players should always watch the youtube tutorial.  Has weird catch up rule throughout the game that punishes players with more cities.  I don't mind this rule because it becomes a part of your strategy, but just doesn't make scense thematically.

RATING: 6
Played 2004 edition once with 6 players currently. Anm excellent mix of economic management, juggling income to build power plants, power lines (city connections) and buy fuel to power cities. Income which you can spend on those things is in turn, dependent upon how many cities you suply power to (which needs plants, lines and fuel).

Market prices are managed well in this game, and there are some good balances to avoid a runaway victor it seems (I remember blowing my first year budget on a nuclear ppower plant and finding I had no cash to do anything at all for another three or more turns to my dismay, but I caught up all the same once I got it connected for example!)

Still, this grame struck me as difficult to explain to beginners - a lot of fiddly interactions, and rather too long and drawn out, with a lot of down time while strategists crunch numbers to try and optimise their expenditure (needing to juggle this truns expenditure on connections, fuel and plants so that they stay in optimal harmony with no cash left at the end of the turn).

Given that, it didn't seem to me to provide the entertainment value I'd like out of those hours spent playing.

Good fun game, my only complaint to the game is that if you are behind and even if you do everything right it is hard to crawl back into it.  In other words the beginning is critical.  I really like the way the commodities work, and refresh.

RATING: 10
Power Grid is one of my few 10s, a game that is right for me in so many ways.  There is a roughly even split between long term strategic considerations (how to expand your network - which cities to build in when, and managing turn order), and short term tactical choices (the auction, and raw material purchases).  Everything matters - it is so very common to wind up a single dollar short from being able to build that last city you wanted to, each and every turn.  

The game demands that players carefully plan each turn, by projecting ahead building and raw material costs in order to not overbid on power plants.  This makes the auction a very dangerous dance as you try to make each opponent overpay for the plant they want without overspending yourself, or - worse - getting a plant you didn't want. 

The way the plants become available is sometimes criticized as too random.  I think it adds needed uncertainty.  Often, the auction forces me to choose between getting a good plant now, or waiting to see what becomes available next - a better plant might drop down, or a dud might turn up in the draw.  Yes, it's random.  If it were not, then the auction would get very boring, very quickly, since the decision of whether to wait would be calculable.  

Overall, this is a brilliant design.  It's a little fiddly, and a little long.  But what it does, it does extremely well.  Not recommended for those who find regular calculation burdensome.  Highly recommended for everyone else.

Great strategy game with little to no luck factor. Was difficult for me to develop a strategy, but I think after a few more plays, experience will help. The gameplay is simple to understand but difficult to master, and turn order is HUGELY important! Is it better to try to get a 1 city headstart or lag behind so you can get a possible cheap power plant AND buy resources first AND buy buildings first? I'm going to have to play this a few more times than rerate it and recomment I'm sure.

Definitely a good economic game. I especially like the resource market.

The last player to place down his first city is forced to either select his starting location for strategic balance between the other players, putting themselves at a significant disadvantage (which therefore few people will do), or place it as it is best for them, almost certainly leaving one other player with a huge advantage in the starting position.

Any game where you can usually tell who is going to win with an 80% chance after the initial setup isn't really an interactive experience, and hardly qualifies as a game.

RATING: 9
Excellent game for the competitive crowd. Constant attention to upgrading plant efficiency is required as new plants come up both in the present and future markets. At the same time, players must watch the changing resource market so as not to find themselves shorted in buying energy resources to power up their newly acquired power plants (as last chooses resources first). In addition to this, one must watch their opponents to make sure they don't get too far ahead with their network development, and that they themselves don't get blocked out of cheaper connections! The two hours goes by fast. The auction phase is improved somewhat with the expansion deck, with some new green plants and tweaks to other plant features.

Includes New Power Plant Cards and Benelux/Central Europe map.

This is a very good game which strikes the right balance between predictability and randomness. There are multiple paths, enough player interaction without being too confrontational and (usually) no runaway leader syndrome. It can be a tad dull at times (waiting for a new stage, not wanting to be the leader, etc) and there can be quite a bit of analysis paralysis, especially towards the end, so that's why the rating is not as high as it could be.

Lowered rating since there were multiple occasions this could be picked and was skipped by vote of majority. Other games are more interesting, I suppose.

love this game. Turn order moves smoothly. Game becomes much harder to win once people have played it a few times. By this i mean everyone is aware of the better options and sometimes the poker player will outplay the genius based on the auctioning style of play. Another game that requires the right type of people to play,for this game can run upwards from 3 hours to play.

After two plays, I cannot see myself giving Power Grid a third chance. I simply find no fun in this game: it is too long, too mathy, and too boring for my liking. Caveat: both times there were 6 of us and the game took over 3 hours to complete. The game might improve with fewer/faster players, but I still think it is way overrated.

I like the original theme. It's generally a good game.

The rules are poorly laid out and the info is not easily accessible. Some finickiness to the rules.

The end game can get very mathy.

The boards are dull and unattractive.

Some stalemating, as players don't want to take the lead and jockey for positions or no body wants to initiate Step 2. Also not liking the mathy ending when some players ask for a calculator. And in general, I don't like punish the leader mechanisms. 

Update from July 2008 to May 2012: 7.5 -> 8.0

PLayed a few 4 player games on weekend for first time. Excellent all round balanced game, almost no noticeble problems. Has all the features of a good multiplayer game: Little or no luck, reasonable/high player interaction, high excitement, fast gameplay, easy to learn but difficult to master, room for great planning and analysis without paralysis, low bookkeeping and the auto balance mechanism where leader is handicapped by turn order sequence. Takes all the best things out the 1830 game and puts them into one slick condensed package. 

Edit: Showing its age a bit in relation to some of the newer Euro's. Game can bog down and bottleneck before key city expansion nodes. Playing time also slows towards end and some artifcial finishes can occur which spoils the experience.

For me personally, this game is dull as dishwater. I thought a game was supposed to have at least some element of fun? Nope. No amount of persuasion will ever result in me playing this game with anyone, not even strip Power Grid with Claudia Schiffer...although...no, not even then. Having said that I was introduced to this by a board game club who thought a 40 second explanation of the rules and then playing the game in total silence was a great way to introduce a potential new member to a game... Also the game was handed to a lesser player because another player thought it'd be fun to king make. Needless to say I haven't been back.

A tense game based around a resource market and auctions for power plants. It's a nice combination of interaction and optimization.

But it's an unforgiving game and it involves a lot of basic arithmetic, which makes it feel more serious compared to other auction games. It sucks when you miscalculate in this game. 

I find it a bit strange that all the mirco-optimization that you do on the board matters so very little, except for turns where you are just short a few electrons to build another house or resource.

There is something strange about the rules (and the rulebook). For the most part, it's not a complex game, and the rules make sense. But there's many little exceptions and special situations (when to remove power plants from the market, the transitions and differences between the phases) that we always seem to forget about at least one of them. And that can really ruin a game, because these rules are needed to keep the game going smoothly. Overall it doesn't feel very elegant to me.

Ah, good old powergrid.  What a fun game.   I suppose the part I'm not crazy about are the rules that encourage players to hold back and not lead. 

One other element that I'm not crazy about is that it effectively becomes a computation exercise at some point, given that there is little to no hidden information.   It truly is a game that rewards thinking long and deep about what you're doing, which isn't typically the type of game that interests me.

Still, the auctions are clever and the game is pretty fun, so it gets an 8.

Power Grid has a few very simple, but well thought-out play mechanics. The resource market and power-plant auction require some complicated analysis in order to understand and truly master the game.

It might just be the engineer in me but I love this game! The auction mechanic, coupled with optimization and just enough math makes for a good combination in my opinion. Even better then all that though is that my gaming group can get through it amazingly quick.

Okay I've played it enough times that now it's pretty tedious and I spend the time wishing I was playing an 18xx game instead.  Good game but gets to feel long if too many players or if you try to play harder map sections.  Probably best for players who want something more chewy that (normally) takes less than two hours and is more forgiving than Age of Steam. But if you don't mind 4 hour games, go for an 18xx game (1830, 1856) instead - they're much more replayable. The new France and Italy maps are pretty cool.

I just don't see what all the fuss is about. To me, most of the decisions in the game boil down to "six-of-one, half-dozen of another" type tactics dictated by contingencies. Yes, there are better or worse decisions to be made, but the space that separates good decisions from bad is very marginal, and usually dictated by player order and the market. To me, the game is just too scripted, with too few actual decisions, most of which are tactical rather than strategic. I feel like the game appears a lot deeper than it is - niggly math and pseudo brain-burn from trying to parse all the minimal advantages passing for depth. And it is loooong for what it is. Better than some of FF's other games, but certainly not one I'd put in the top 10, or even the top 100. I know I'm in the distinct minority on this one, though.

This game has been around for a while. Some people love it and are very good at it, which makes introducing it difficult to introduce new players, unless the new players are ready to lose a few long games without understanding why they lost. Also, it is easy to fall behind early and never have a chance of getting back into the game.

I enjoy this a lot more with 3 or more players.  I do like the current printing and the box art.  The last few turns can be decided by whomever cares to figure it out.

Once you get the rules figured out this is a very enjoyable game to play.

Actually that's not true, I have no advantage playing this game after building a real power plant, just enjoy playing the game.

I hear comments from other gamers that they feel Power Grid is too dry, but I disagree wholeheartedly. The fun in this is in the competitiveness. The auctioning phase is of utmost importance to winning the game, and many games I've played come down to just a couple of Electro's.

Very nice tactical game of connecting up cities to your grid while trying to get the best deal for power plants and the resources to power them.  I do enjoy the game and am impressed by how well all the different game elements fit together, but it has two aspects that I do not care for: 1) it is a long game (2-3 hours) and 2) it has mechanisms built into it to keep everyone fairly close right until the end of the game.  Many of the games I've played have ended in a tie and been decided by the tie-breaker (most money left over).  Not necessarily a bad thing, but not very satisfying.

A good complexity level. The resouce market's simulated supply and demand is a neat mechanic. Also how the game changes the turn order during some of the phases,('handicaps the leader/assists the loser' by making them go first/last when it's beneficial to do so). Still can have some runaway games though.

UPDATE 2010:  After many years, it's clear this is a "10" to me because, win or lose, I never fail to have fun playing this game.  Hard to describe what it is about this game that keeps it fresh and exciting, but whatever that trait is, I wish more games had it.

Buying Power Stations and selling electricity ... and someone has made a game about this, surely not? Yep, and what a corker it is! This is another game witha really good turn order mechanic, which always stops you shooting off building masses of city connections. And the auction of the power plants is really interesting.

I played "classic" Power Grid again recently - i.e., Power Grid with the plant deck it shipped with, and not the expansion deck which I use all the time these days - and was shocked at just how poor a game it felt like. The market was gummed up with worthless plants at various times arbitrarily screwing some players, and resource markets routinely faced exhaustion.

When playing classic Power Grid, you really have to factor these elements of game dysfunction into your play. You need to bid aggressively on good plants that show up early in Phase 2 knowing that the end of Phase 2 tends to screech to a halt with worthless plants. You need to manage your player order knowing that there is a high risk of running out of Coal or Oil, and you can lose because you were the best player on the last turn and other players bought up all the coal and oil to screw you. It's all completely unsatisfactory.

I am a fan of Power Grid with the deck mini-expansion. I would not play the basic Power Grid again.
---
Although definitely an improvement over Funkenschlag, Power Grid has fallen off a little bit with repeated play. The 6 player game turned out to be a bust, as the middle game (where all the good stuff is) seemed to be eliminated, and the game went right from early to endgame phases. Otherwise, I still like the game a fair amount, but things just seem ever so slightly out of whack - the midgame gets locked up a bit too frequently when no useful plants are available to anyone for too long. The endgame sometimes hinges more on what order the plants come out in than on player skill. And just hope you never get into the position of actually exhausting the available coal/oil resources, which can totally screw people completely arbitrarily. Now, these things don't come up a lot, which is why the rest of the good stuff in the game is still quite good. But Power Grid isn't *quite* there, and I wish it were. I think Funkenschlag had these same problems, we just were never able to play enough (due to the length) to really discover them.

Lots of fun accumulating wealth and expanding your power empire! In Power Grid, players bid on power plants, buy raw materials to fuel those plants, build into, and then power those cities using their plants and raw materials.  Each power plant uses a certain type of raw materials and powers a certain number of cities, so the power plants and how much you spend on them are very important!

I really like the dynamic in this one where it often pays to lurk for a lot of the game, and then decide when to make your move for the win.  Once in a while someone manages to lead for the entire game, but it's few and far between.  A very challenging game when played with other experienced players!

A good mix of strategy and tactics in a great system.

However, after 20 plays, I do feel like the game is rather same-y from game to game, and my desire to play it has waned a lot. Still a great game design though!

Update: 5/25/10.  
Played with: 2-5.
Length: 2 hours. 

Power Grid is our default "gateway" game (usually as a step up for friends who have played Catan elsewhere).  The components are nice enough, though nothing amazing.  The gameplay involves some sort of efficiency/race hybrid that I seem to be intuitively good at, but that lacks tension for me because I don't fully understand what I'm doing.  The auctions are fun, and provide interesting interaction, but unless everyone is particularly good at the game, they often result in largely random outcomes.  For now, it's a game that I will never turn down, but that I'm not going to suggest regularly.

Did not like PG during my first game. This is a train game in disguise. I was also very disappointed with the less-than elaborate commodity market mechanism, which is a contrived demand-supply system. I expected a more realistic system driven by true supply and demand.

Six months later, I decided to re-visit this game and bought it, along with the Frace/Italy board. It met my current games-to-buy-criteria. Played it again and enjoyed it tremendously.

2nd edition: I like the theme, but my feeling is that the whole game is not strategic enough. What really matters is picking the right course in buying power plants. The on board action isn't as crucial as I'd like it to be.

Played the full game and this game is amazing.  it moves fast enough for me (We were done in 90 minutes) and is so strong of a game!  Moving up to 8.5  (5/6/10)

Moving up to a 9.5 and could become my favourite game.  i say that if I still feel this way about the game on my next wedding anniversary that it will become truly my favourite game of all time.  I get beaten bad now (I was very good when we first began) and I seem to miss one vital thing in the last couple of turns but still fantastic.  (10/25/10)

Yeah, this is my favourite game and gets the much coveted 10 spot which only 2 other games have!  (7/1/11)

Un juego de dificultad media-alta el cual incorpora varias mecánicas en un sólo juego. Tiene mecánicas como subastas, manejo de recursos y control de territorio.

Este juego es de estrategia pero aún así una buena estrategia no lo es todo, puesto que en cada ronda el jugador que va a la cabeza tiene desventaja respecto a los otros. La parte de azar del juego está en como van apareciendo las plantas de energía y su vez esto hace en cada partida uno tenga que ir cambiando de estrategia al ver el estado del mercado y las ciudades a las que está yendo cada jugador.

The beginning and middle of the game are great, as you balance having the best land and going later in the turn order (to give you access to the best power plants and cheapest resources).

However, the end game has lead to too many kingmaking situations for me. In the final round, twice I have been faced with the situation where I can't win, but whether or not I expand will determine who does win.

I find those endings disappointing.

Probably my favorite heavier strategy game. The interplay of systems in this game is fascinating and best of all, clear. Many heavier games just try to dump these complex overlapping systems onto players, forcing them to spend game after game figuring out the subtleties of how they all fit together. But here you understand how every phase affects the other pretty quickly, and the fun instead lies in good ol' fashioned optimization and mastery - but of course, there are random factors and other players that make true optimization evasive, which only serves to make the chase all the more compelling. It's all about simplicity of rules w/ depth of play, yo.

And that's not even mentioning how great the market system all on its own - there's no game that captures supply and demand so well.

Update: This is still one of my favorites, and I have a hard time agreeing to play other similar games when I could just play Power Grid again. Earned its 10 long ago.

Update: Lowering to a 9. Really, still one of my favorites but these days it DOES feel a little overlong. PG does a great job of keeping you engaged 'til the end, but I do think it goes on for about 30 minutes too long - because while the game's systems are super compelling it is largely a game of escalation; you're just getting bigger and bigger throughout the game whereas something like Keyflower is a little more dynamic so 2-2.5 hrs feels appropriate. Not a knock on the design of PG at all (everything I said above still applies) - just the length.

This game takes a few plays to really enjoy for all it is about.  It is one of those games I nearly completely understand, but still find myself agonizing over decisions.  It really is a game that is played over a board because the table dynamic is so important.  I would only recommend it for 2-5 players.  The 6 player game gets a bit chaotic.

1 - I love this game.  very deep and engaging, yet relatively easy to teach and get new gamers into.  The expansion maps are great and makes this one of my most played games.  The components are decent quality, and the board is sturdy with a good feel.  One of the few games that I would rate a perfect 10.

The theme and graphic design of the game and box are terrific. Presentation is close to the best I have seen in a game. It could almost pass for cool! Games that look like this could push games more into the mainstream. Plus, the supply/demand economy is very cool. However, it's a little convoluted and fiddly to me.  It has the annoying midgame stall when there are crappy plants, and the entire game can turn on (un)lucky plant draws. Also, I peg the over/under on the number of times people count their money during the game at 50. Ugh. I still like the game though.

Brilliant.  And I'm not good at math at all, so those who say there's too much of it are, in my opinion, wrong.

I'm going to get everything Friese does, just to support his designs.  It's that good.  Don't listen to the naysayers--GET THIS GAME!

RATING: 8.5
A game that took a lot of plays for me to truly "get". Liking it more and more. 
I do NOT find it "mathy". Because there is a power plant auction before buying resources and building cities, players need to see how much cash they have minus the cost of resources and city builds to figure out their maximum bid.

My gf considers herself terrible at math and she rates this a "10". So I do NOT think it is "mathy".

Decent game. I understand why people love it, and I will play it on occasion. 
However, I do have three minor problems with it that keep me from playing more often. One, the game is a little too mathy for me. Two, I find the game repetitive. I find myself doing roughly the same thing each game. Sure there are different Power Plants, but all they really do IMO is change the resources I need to buy. And three, I find that there is sometimes a runaway leader. During many of the games I played, one person got ahead and no one could catch up. We knew the winner a while before the game ended. 
To leave on a positive note, however, I do enjoy the rampy-ness of the game. The feeling of growing more powerful and being able to do more things was enjoyable.

RATING: 6.5
[u]April 2008:[/u] Great game, a lot of maths but really enjoyable and good to teach newcomers. Pretty straightforward but then again not that much with the catch-up mechanics. All is about timing, I like that in a game.

[u]June 09:[/u] There is one thing I'm lame at and that's auction games. However, I like them pretty much. One problem usually with auction games is when 1 player in the game is a newb, he doesn't know the price of things and can severely unbalance a game. However, this is not something present in Power Grid and this is fortunate.
But one can't reduce PG to an auction game. There is also a big aspect of network building where competition for the cheap connections can become quite intense.
The resource track is also a brilliant idea. Basically, the more a resource is in demand, the higher the price will go. A simple touch that adds another layer of competition.
Ovrall, this is a very interactive and competitive game, and not just because of the auction as is often the case in these games. Here, the competition is everywhere. However, there is no sense of direct aggression or bashing or kingmaking. Although it can happen, it is not very flagrant.

I think the design of the game is almost flawless but I'm not that big a fan either (go figure) so I'm rating it a 7.5 which sounds quite about right for a game I feel is intelligent yet doesn't wake me up at noght. Maybe it's the theme, I don't know for sure.

[u]December 2010:[/u] Changed my rating system, the game is now rated 6.5

RATING: 6.5
Math is good. However, too much math isn't, and this game can really bog down because of analysis paralysis as you're trying to calculate your moves. Many games have this element, but this one is probably the worst offender. Still, the gameplay is pleasant and it's definitely a game I enjoy despite the downtime which might occur and the need to calculate a lot if you want to win. It's not hard math of course, but there's just too much of it in the game in my opinion.

While I do enjoy it as it's a little different than most other eurogames (it's also a race and not a game in which you count your VPs in the end), it's not a game I would play very often and I honestly don't know how this game is ranked as number 6 on BGG (I understand most of the Top10/100 and overall tend to agree with most of them, but not this one).

Board play is reminiscent of Medieval Merchant. The auctions are the best bit. The rest is rather dull housekeeping and accountancy. Players who aren't strong at mental arithmetic and forward planning will generally not do well.

I've had some good times playing Power Grid, but I'm really hesitant to agree to play it when people bring it up. The whole game hinging on the minutest calculations can be annoying and a path to AP. It doesn't help that this is a relatively rare Euro in that it supports six players, which means it only tends to get suggested with the max number, which isn't its sweet spot.

During my first playing (2004 version) I was intrigued and generally very engaged. But the ending mechanics were disappointing and didn't follow an intuitive, rewarding reasoning. The end game seemed anti-climactic for a game with such promise. Need to play more, but I don't think this will ever become a favorite because it's so close to being GREAT that its few stumbles really bug me.

Great blend of mechanics and player interaction. There's not an abundance of rules and pieces so the game is easier to pick up and play.

I wish there was something besides paper money...

My favorite "economy" based game (although Panamax is a really good, but different, economic game as well).  I would never get tired of this game, and whenever someone says "let's do Powergrid", I don't hesitate despite the necessity to dedicate a few good hours to the experience.

Excellent game mechanics, excellent player interaction due to the bidding function, and a lot of math involved.  One of my favorites, and clearly what a game is supposed to be about.

This is a great game system . . . and great for six players.  I am finding this more fun each time I play it.  

I don't like the rule where one area is removed from the board when playing six players, though it does create a different board each time.

This game sounds like a game I would take to and love.  Unfortunately, it does not live up to the hype.  The first half of the game plays beautifully with a very tight feel, but the end game is so lack-luster.  I was let down a little on my first play (3-player), but I'm starting to get it and I like it.  The game is much better with 5-6 people.  

The end-game really gets me in this one.  Its such a flurry of number crunching, game-slowing, city-grabbing. As soon as Step 3 hits, the game is almost over.  There is no time to 'ENJOY' step 3.  In fact, why even have a Step 2 in the game?  It hardly ever lasts more than 1/2 a turn. /sigh.  
--note: the 3 player game can be really tense and good at times - but there are games where the final turn is the same turn when step 3 (and 2) happen that leave me feeling very unsatisfied.

Most confusing line of instructions at first glance of any game: "Step 2 starts before phase 5 after the first player has connected his 7th city during phase 4 (Building)."  Then to compound the problem you get a card that should read "Step 3" and is referenced throughout the instructions as "Step 3" but was printed as "Phase 3." Huh? What? This game is confusing enough for the first time player! That being said, I can't wait to play this one again.

Best with 4-5 players

Great game and one which my group plays heaps.  Maybe it's just my group, but I find strategies ended up being similar most game and there is a great element of luck in with regard to having the right powerplant turning up at the right time.  Maybe it's just with my group.

RATING: 7.9
A game that I very much enjoy playing, but find a little bit clunky in terms of the mechanics and the amount of work that players need to do in order to make it work. 

The importance of getting the right power plants seems to overwhelm the other decisions (resources/map), and the 'luck of the draw' can leave players stranded with nothing much to do in the last 3rd of the game. Sucks to be them!

Perhaps not as well play tested as it might have been... Perhaps also over-hyped on the 'geek?

Still fun after playing for over a decade - hard to put my finger on what makes it so special.  Sometimes I think 50% of the attraction is just the cartoony artwork.  Every time I've ever played this, people are standing up around the table for the last turn, as if their very lives depended on the outcome - that's a great game.

RATING: 5
9 rating after one play... and a two player game at that. I expect this game has a shot at a 10. Man, my brain enjoys this one!

Some observations... although it is a "heavier" game, it's not as hard as I thought. The only difficulty is in keeping the plant market maintained properly, subbing out the low or high plants according to various rules. But, the rest of the game flows very smoothly. As long as one person can maintain the plant market, everyone else can focus on the task at hand: plants, resources, and cities. 

Not as math-intense as its reputation, and certainly not the hardest game I own, but it is definitely a thinker. Really clever way to keep the fluctuating market for resources. Thinking and concentrating were never so fun!

Update after 5 plays -- dropped this to an "8". Don't get me wrong, I still like this game, but the sneaky sensation that the game is very scripted is starting to creep in. I dunno. With this most recent play, it was the first time that the ending of the game felt contrived or artificial. It feels like winning demands a manipulation of the game's eccentric flow instead of some sort of cohesive strategy. I'll be curious to see if this is the beginning of a change of opinion, or if I'm just "going through a phase" in my teenage Power Grid years.

Update: Dropped this to a "7." I'm glad I own it, and I appreciate its novel mechanics. But, as I play more games and discover alternatives, I'm struck by the fact that the endgame seems a bit lacking in drama, and it takes too long. I'll still play it, but I'll be suggesting other games first.

Update: Dropped to a 6 and traded away in a math trade. This just wasn't hitting the table. The wonky tricks with turn order and odd endgame kept me sour on this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I really like the gameplay of Power Grid:  turn orders, phases of play, and so on.  It can be a real balancing act to get everything paid for and powered, which makes weighing priorities fun and challenging.  Some people call it "fiddly," but I don't see the fiddliness to be a detraction, but more of a positive feature.  The different maps (official and not) add a little variety, as does the removal of one playing area in each game.

I have rated Power Grid an 8 after the first play, mostly due to the time investment. I ideally prefer a bit shorter games, but this one was worth learning. If I knew we would play frequently with a larger group, I would probably rate it higher. We played a 2 player game with two robots from the Robot expansion. We really enjoyed it, but I suspect it would be more of a challenge with more players.

One of the gems of the designer board gaming world.

Power Grid is an economic area-control game about becoming an energy magnate.  You'll buy power plants, expand your electrical grid, manage various resources required to operate the plants, and collect earnings based on the number of cities to which you deliver power.

It's very heavy, with little direct player interaction.  It requires you to constantly calculate the costs of things you need compared to the benefits of procuring them.  I love this game.

The turn by turn varying player order is such an elegant way to give advantages to the players that drop behind. Games are close run and tense throughout and you always have to work out the best way to spend your money. 

Update: This one is going down to an 8. Mainly due to the last couple of turns so often overriding what happened earlier in the game. You don't want to be in the lead in the last turn of this game. 

And now down to a 7. Feel like I have played enough of this one.

All of the right elements are there for a good game except for the disappointing economic snowball, but the result is far less than the sum of its parts.  The player who holds back most is also the largest possible beneficiary of luck in the game.  Requires a highly tactical ply analysis of player options for good play which simply isn't interesting.  The end game fizzles and whimpers to a dead end.  I really dislike economic snowball games.

This game instantly grabbed me, and I think the rating could go up after some more plays.  The different boards add to the game, and the game evolves in a natural and exciting way.  I'm also pleased that a slightly more weighty game can handle six players, as there has been a trend of late to max out games with four.  Because of this larger range of players, I'm sure it will hit the table more frequently than others.  Top tier game.

UPDATE: Sold in a recent purge of eurogames. It's a solid game, but most of my friends on it, so it's pretty easy to play. I played it enough that it wasn't coming out much anymore.

One of the first games I played besides Lost Cities/RFTG. the unassuming box hides a pretty brutal game of auctioning and getting the most out of every purchase. If you like auction-based games then step right this way...if not, then approach with caution. You can probably guess which side I fell by my rating.

[UPDATE 1/16] This one doesn't get to the table much for me: as I said below, for everything PG does well, I have a game that does it just a little bit better. (Though I will give props to PG playing well for 5 or even 6 players, which Brass and Fleet don't do and Chicago Express doesn't do as well.) And many of my opportunities to play PG in my regular gaming group get bogged down in a sharks-v-minnows dynamic as the experienced players wipe the floor with the n00bs in a way that's less than 100% fun.

All that said, sitting down with a table of relative novices (namely, my wife, parents and father-in-law) with my having just enough experience to be able to keep the game moving but not enough that I instantly know how to take advantage of everyone's blunders: fun. A great deal of fun. Validating my opinion that PG is an [i]excellent[/i] game for a group of intelligent, patient people even if they're not Veteran Gamers.

---

:sugar: I enjoy Power Grid, and it has certain undeniably appealing aspects (gracefully handling a broad range of player counts, easy enough rule set, not incredibly fiddly) but PG feels a bit static and procedural, with a less dynamic economy than games like Brass (a more interesting build-a-network-and-manipulate-commodity-prices game) and Chicago Express (a more interesting auction game).

RATING: 7.8
A fun game with a bit of luck but mainly proper planning involved. It is surprisingly fun to decide whether to expand your network or buy a good power plant to gain an advantage in later turns or to buy all the fuel you need to power all of your connections this turn. Of course, it is a lot of fun to bid on a plant you know one of your opponents wants badly but you could do without - only to get stuck with it in the end and waste the money you intended to use for fuel and expanding your network - while eventually realising buying that plant was the best thing you could have done and winning the game because of it. 

The fact that you seldom use the entire board can be a bit confusing, but it also means most of the time, you can get more variation from each board. Since the board is two-sided, you will get yet more variation! In this version, the Transformer Station is included as standard. Do not underestimate its importance in the game! You can leave it out, but it is so much fun that this would probably be a real pity.

Nothing is hidden in this game, except the stategy you come up with. The player who fares worst, gets to buy fuel and expand his/her network first. In theory, this would even the game out pretty well, but in reality, it is still possible for the leading player to stay on top throughout the game. However, it seems only fair that the game is not evened out so much that being the leading player is discouraged until the last turn.

This game is very amusing and does not contain difficult concepts, while it certainly can be taxing on your brains at times. There is sufficient interaction to prevent boredom during other players' turns yet you also have a degree of freedom to just do your thing and have a blast, regardless of what the others do. I like that, as to me this means I can enjoy a lost game more fully.

It was love at first play. This is an outstanding game that I do not get to play enough. I think the mechanics are brilliant and it creates a wonderful amount of tension that continues to build as the game progresses. The last couple turns always take a very long time, but the payoff is always worth it, even if I'm not winning. I love the intricacies of all the phases and the jockeying for position on the turn track.

My ultimate gamer goal is to run a Power Grid World Tour League. Over the course of several months the same group of players would play a game on every map and award points based on what place they finish. The player with the most points would be the ultimate Power Grid Champion. I would definitely spring for a custom trophy of plaque for the winner. It would be quite the accomplishment.

A nice classic brainburner.  Near the end you'll end up trying to guess what your opponents will think you think they'll be doing two turns ahead, at which point your brain will dribble out your ears, you'll say "screw it", bid too much for the station, run out of fuel, and lose miserably.  Because of this (or in spite of this, perhaps?) it's a lot of fun to play.

My play of this was...  interesting.  I should note it was on the Russian map with 4 players.  The way that was played, all the math and strategies seemed extremely obvious to me, and the decisions were pretty easy to make.  In addition, I found the way I ended the game pretty...  unsatisfying.  I was second-to-last to buy plants, and I was able to buy four to make a total of 18, when no one else could build more than seventeen, and I was able to power them all.  The building up was pretty interesting, but it lead to a flat end, and that was disappointing to me.  In addition to that, I hated the cheap paper money.

I've heard the map was a weak one, and I'd play again on a different map if more people wanted to, but I'm pretty meh on this game for now.

A good time, but it grew stale (even with all the maps).  I will only play this with 5-6 players these days.

Update:
I no longer even hold a player count preference.  I find just about every count largely uninteresting.  This game is a case study in how to suck the life out of a game with a poor catch up mechanism.  The "meat" of the game becomes completely secondary to the jockeying for poll position that quickly becomes tiresome.

Great ride for the price of admission.

There are some games out there that you just don't think are interesting from a theme-perspective.  Then you swallow your pride and take a shot at it and you kick yourself for not doing so earlier.

I love how everything has been implemented in this game from the auctions (which I rarely like in a game), resource management, and the constant calculations I have to keep in my head.  This game also scales extremely well and still feels like the same game whether at 2 or 6 players.  And it is always a bonus when I can have any 6-player game without forced expansions.  

While this game seems to take some time to crank out, it doesn't seem like you spent so many hours playing it.  This game is deserving of it's high marks.

Your goal is to supply the most cities with power from your power plants.
You build your own supply system and auction the power plants so that the highest bidder gets the power plants he needs to make the biggest profit.
Nice market for resources so one always have to be on the lookout for opportunities and that makes it a bad decision, most often, to concentrate on a single type of energy source.

Buttery smooth economic game. I would give it a 10 but it has one flaw that bothers me to much to give it a 10. The roping off the board when playing bugs me. Why? Days of Wonder can include two boards with four different player counts in Small World, but no one else can seem to do that. I know this came out before Small World but they just came out with an anniversary edition which could have had them included.

Other than that it's an excellent game and it loses a mark for a component mishap.

Relatively simple game but with much depth, can be a bit of a brain burner.   Luck plays a larger factor in this game then most Euros and/or you must remember the order the power plants go on the bottom of the stack.  If you don't know the order they're coming out of the pile then you won't know how to set up your bidding for power plants for the end game.  -2 for the math induced headache I get while playing.

Got it a few weeks ago and have already played several times, at least once with every player count except six. I love the intensity of how simple the auction is and seeing someone bid on a plant to try to raise the price without actually wanting it and seeing them yell out in remorse whenever the others all pass. The resources portray a very basic supply and demand economic structure, but the design of it is gracefully simple. Building is one of the least interesting things in the game, but even that is incredibly entertaining as players clump up on the cheap part of the map but quickly realize they are now trapped there and forced to jump across the map paying astronomical connection fees. The game end is not always exciting, but I have had a couple games come down to the difference of a dollar as the player in last suddenly mounts a massive push and builds all the way up to where first place is at and snatches the game from under their nose. I don't mind the mathiness of the game one bit, as I actually happen to love doing math and go out of my way to try to figure out the most cost effective option for me and how high I should bid before it is no longer worth it. But just as fun is going with my gut till I run out of cash and watching other players make mistakes and just praying that I make it to the victory. I love this game

 This is probably my least favorite of the top 25 games. There is certainly some strategy in which power plants to buy and how much to pay, but it doesn't seem to really matter until the last two turns or so. Starting position seems to make a huge difference and it is easy for one player to get away unbothered while everyone else jockeys for position. Given how long it takes to play, there are tons of other games I'd rather substitute. The biggest plus is that it plays a larger number of players, without being coop or party.

RATING: 9
2.0 >> Interesting game of resource management and timing. The fluctuating market values for the various materials coupled with the semi-random assortment of plants available for sale seem to work well together. 

A warning to new players: initial placement is extremely critical in this game though, a poorly thought out starting location can have you paying a premium throughout the early game, which is a potential death knell in a game of exponential growth. 

I can see what others are talking about with the runaway leader issue to some degree, but am not overly bothered by it. In a game wherein luck plays a minor role, the person in the lead is there because they're doing a lot of things right, if they're running away with the game, it's likely because their strategy is working that much better than the those of the other players. I can understand the frustration because the learning curve on this game is fairly high, and for the first several games I played it felt like I had no grip on the way things meshed together, and like I had no hope of catching up; with an experienced group this is less of an issue though, scores stay tighter, and the person in 'last' is often manoeuvreing themself in for the late game kill. 

Speaking of the luck factor, I know what some will say, the plant auction can hand some very nice plants out to players who are late in the bidding, and while this does have something to do with luck, at that time, the fact of the matter is that the player who is sitting there getting the 25 at face value before the mid-game stall is there because they passed up on other, obviously lucrative options and decided to press their luck in a style very reminisent of Ra, and with similar dangers involved. I have no problem with the mechanism, and I think it works nicely in that a player who is a little back can have at least a chance at getting back into the thick of things if they can draw their way into a valuable plant on the cheap. In general, the random hand-outs of the plant market can be mitigated by knowing when to not auction things if you're earlier in the order. I will still grant the fact that players can be put into "damned if you do, damned if you don't" situations where they have to put something up for auction and pray that the last player in doesn't get a good draw, but by and large I think the "Plant Lottery" aspect of the game is brought up altogether too much, and I do not feel that it generally is enough to swing game results.

At all scales this game seems well-balanced though I prefer it at 4-5 as the resource market becomes more volatile but the downtime isn't quite as bad as it is with 6. The rating on this initially went from an 8 to a 9,  and then peaked at 9 in my ratings scheme and achieved a terminal 9 status. I think the reason that it initially became terminal is due to a mild niggling feeling that I have that the game just isn't quite as good as it could have been...I think this is mainly because of the generally lacklustre final turn or two, which ultimately create an unsatisfying finish for me whether I'm winning or losing. It's not that I don't feel that I've earned my loss or defeat, it's just anti-climatic. The journey there is always quite enjoyable, but the actual final stanza always feels flat, even when it comes down to the money, which it often does. It's undeniably a solid game, and a clear cut above most of the stuff out there, but is not worthy of being amongst my all time classics either.

(One play of Great Britain. A nice map, but I think some of the theme should be discarded in trade for gameplay. I dislike how the Natural Gas plants are ridiculously overpowered in comparison to the other plants in the game, which is a combination of the commonality of the material with their low starting prices. Bidding them up helps, but only so much. I did like the material crunch at the end and the power plant angst, but I don't know if those are typical, of if we just had a particularly tight game.)

This game is not losing its appeal.

It takes a while and always requires fresh minds. One game in an evening is plenty.

The post game analysis is always a feature.  You often have plenty of ideas about how you went wrong.  The temptation is always to launch into another game but I lack the stamina. 

2013:
Unlike Peurto Rico this game if anything is growing on me.  I think I have a firm grasp on how to play the game with efficiency and can still track my opponents options without much effort.

I have always played this game with a combination of intuition and maths.  I'm sure that this is beginning to cost me games against opponents that have the same level of experience.  I think that you need to always call on some simple algebra at key moments to consistently win this game.

When gaming I have a fly by the pants attitude that would scare me senseless in real life.  I play fast and loose but to get better at this game I will need to calculate earlier and more often.  I'm not a patient gamer and I will have to force myself to stop and calculate at the turning points of the game.

Quick or slow, calculated or intuitive I still love this game and my win percentage has nothing to do with it.

In 2014 this game was always close to another play, for the first time in a while this may not be on the menu. Simply because GMT games are starting to appear in a form that can be played in two sessions.  This game is still great and I will return.

A fun game.  A good game.  An auction game.  Really, everything happening on the board is largely irrelevant.  The game is in the auction of plants - and those come up with some randomness.  Which means this game can have some pretty wonky situations... stalls or runaway wins are entirely possible.  And to make matters worse, the winner is going to keep on winning and there is nothing the others can do about it.  Still, despite these flaws a solid game.

Dry but solid puzzle/auction game with nice theme and a lot to think about (or calculate). The bidding is quite enjoyable in the early and middle stages and the resource market is fun. But the end can be a little dull while everyone calculates their final moves. Recd in Trade 07 - unplayed

I like the combination of resource managing, bidding, and building/blocking in this game.  The cards and board are very cool looking, and the double-sided board is a huge bonus.  Lots of fun, and not particularly unfriendly to nongamers.

May 2008 - I've decided that while PG is a good game, I'd suggest many other games first.  It's a bit too Euro for me possibly.

Have a few playthroughs under our belts now and this is shaping up to rival Puerto Rico as my favorite game.  The amount of things to think about and the depth of the decisions you can make is great.  We're starting to really get a hold on the mechanic of racing to the finish in the last few turns, making sure to spend wisely and finish at the ideal capacity.

I played this for the first time at my first gaming group session with 5 people. I loved it and afterward quickly placed an order online to buy my own copy. I still consider myself a boardgaming newbie, so I was surprised that I would like this top-rated and often classified "gamers game". I actually didn't find anything about it complex at all. It reminded me of monopoly but much more fun and I loved the different mechanics like building and bidding for power plants. Highly recommended and looking forward to playing with my friends and family.

RATING: 9.1
I love the auction in this game. It is fairly standard, but the way different plants are worth more or less to different players at different times, really rewards players who are paying attention to the entire game state, and can properly valuate each plant to get one at a bargain and make someone else overpay.

I knew I arrived as a legitimate board gamer when I understood and started winning Power Grid. It's an important game because it's the perfect second level gateway game. In other words, once you got a friend who has played enough level one games like Ticket to Ride and Acquire, introduce him or her to Power Grid so he or she can take the next step.

Definitely lives up to the hype.  One of the best games I've played in terms of theme.  It still plays well with 2, but some of the air is taken out of the plant auctions. Be warned that if an over-analyzer is in your group a game of this can be a painful experience.  I love that the scoring mechanism that determines the winner (money), must also be used throughout the game to purchase plants, resources, and connections.

RATING: 10
The supply/demand game mechanic is just so clever. I also like the balance and feel that in most games, the winner isn't decided mid/early in the game, but nearer to the end (and sometimes the last round). The artwork, theme, and component quality is 10/10. I love the additional boards that can be added to mix things up. For the most part, the PG games I've played with expansion boards aren't fantastically different but are fun. 

This might be another sentimental 10 rating. This was one of the first nontraditional board games that I was introduced to and I have not stopped loving it since game 1.

Insanely cool game that involves keeping track of lots of small rules. Once we got it down, my group had a great time, but our first time learning it involved just completely messing up a lot of the rules and little things you have to keep in mind while making decisions. Would work insanely well as an app game (if it isn't already) where a lot of that is kept track of for you.

After just a few plays, this is quickly becoming a favorite of both of ours.  We played a couple of times on board game night and it went very well, so we added it to our own collection along with the Robots.  It's been a great addition, as it is quite easy to leave out and stop a game after a few turns, then pick it up and resume later on.

I need to play it much more often or give up on it completely. In all my games  I have played well enough to win but because I don't know the game well I get rorted in some hideous way that leaves the whole experience quite sour. I am close to canning this game since as much as I admire it and am good at it in general strategy, my ability to froget important rules loopholes for the endgame just makes the game frustrating. It is not my kind of game in that you can blow your opportunity to win in ways that are not obvious unless you have played a lot. I admit that my rating partly reflects my experience of playing with overcompetitive people (an experienced player who did a game changing take back preventing me from building out then deny me a takeback just after buying resources when I realised he would buy all the coal available next round, the only thing that could prevent me from winning, and another who was very selective in their answer to a direct rules question)

Power Grid is a good game. With good balance, scales to any number of players, everything works correctly.
My main complaints are: 1) clunkiness of mechanics, such as, the artificial manipulation of power plant's stack, the compensatory turn order, and general need of elegance. 2) Power Grid is too "exact" and slow, it provides minimal amounts of fun and quite a big downtimes. 3) Production: I really hate the art. Cities and connexions are inherent ugly and unhelpful, the regions are poorly delineated and the colors are confusing. The paper money is just shaming. (I've seen maps with regions separed by a white line. Mine isn't :-S)
It's a good game but it's boring and much too long.

RATING: 7
My opinion of Power Grid is quickly starting to sour for two reasons:  

1) The end game bogs down to a crawl as the game encourages everyone to slowly count out and maximize every dollar by counting out various routes and connections.

2) All the things I like about the game (the route planning, the auctions) seem important but in the end I really think it's just "not screwing up" those factors ... and that the game really boils down to timing and positioning yourself in last just before the end game so you can build and buy resources first.

I don't hate it but I feel like I've played my last game of Power Grid for a while.

Update: Gave it some time off and playing it again (knowing ahead of time that it was all about the timing) was more fun. Curious to try more maps that have come out in the meantime.

After several plays I finally feel like I'm beginning to understand the game better.  The key is in deciding when to upgrade power plants.  It's also in deciding which power plants are best in the current game, but unless your plants can power a winning number of cities, you stand little chance of winning the game.

What I love about this game: if you did well, you know exactly what you did to get the edge, if you did badly, you know where it all began to go wrong.  

Also, a great heavy game to play with newbies, because most of it can be explained as you go along - most of the complexity is in the housekeeping.

Excellent blend of auction (which I usually don't care for very much, but I enjoy it in this game), resource management and area control.  A much simpler game than I was led to believe, but though the mechanics of the game are relatively simple, the choices that must be made at each step lend a lovely depth to the game.  Not a game that I'd like to play after a long day at work, but would really enjoy with a lighthearted group of friends who aren't going to get too overly cutthroat (which I could easily see happening with some groups).

I don't love the budget calculations you have to do each turn, but the game works so well I don't really mind it that much.

RATING: 10
This is my PERFECT GAME, a 10.
Why?.... It's got all the following:
Resource management similar to Settlers, path movement similar to Ticket to ride, Money management, Nice bits, Good scoring system, future market, resource market moves up and down as game goes on.  No dice, Luck does not make you win. No run-away leader.  It doesn't get any better than this game.  I think this is a game for a 9-10yr, if they are gamers and used to games like Catan, For Sale, etc they should have no problem with this game.  After further play I can recommend this game for a 7-8 yr old, we removed the "bidding" aspect in the power plant buying phase and our 6-1/2 yr old was able to play the game without a problem.  With this minor modification and maybe a little help a 7-8 yr old should be able to play and they should be able to hold their own.  I would start with lighter "auction style and resource management games like "For Sale", "Ticket to Ride" and "Settlers of Catan" befor introducing a young one to this game but if they like playing boardgames they will like this one.  Even better /Quicker on BSW

An absolutely fantastic game that has stayed fresh with the addition of a wide variety of maps, though I can be content with the original maps.  Risk and money management are the keys to this game.

A lot of factors to keep in mind with this auction/resource management euro. The only serious detractor is the trackable-hidden money. Probably best with 4/5 players, but there's a lot of maps available so that probably varies. As I start to firm up ideas of which city sites are best to grab early and come to grips with fair auction prices I find that my opinion of this game is increasing. 

Note: be careful to keep in mind tiebreakers when bidding on power plants and when building cities.

Funkenschlag is a cruel and harsh mistress, sleek and seductive in her skintight greenish outfit, hugging her ancestral Germanic features in disturbing ways. She calls out to me softly, and expects to be obeyed. I lay her out on the table, careful, as not to upset her. She is still angry with me for making a tiny tear in one of the game boards. I keep out a wary eye for her little 'toys': money, plants, houses and a city grid. I am eager for my lesson, but she restrains me. She gives me permission to speak and briefly explain the rules. My mistress delights in making things difficult for me, and distracting me with questions when I am thinking. Sometimes she lets out a shrill laugh of triumph when I need to refer to the rules again. It's all part of my lesson.

Then my torment begins. My mistress tempts me in all ways imaginable. She moves her body in mesmerising ways when I need to caress her with a house. When she is not pleased with my touch, she immediately whips me mercilessly, so that I cannot close my fingers to hold on to the money and have to make do with small change. She lures me with powerful plants, only to deny them to me. Sometimes she is pleased with me and gives me a good plant as a bone to a good dog, but cackles frighteningly as she withholds the necessary fuel. I weep in anguish, but know my torment is not over. No, not yet.

She begins to favour those... others. My mistress laughs at my pain and tells me in that sweet, sweet voice of hers that I cannot give her what they can. She shows me in graphic detail, pointing out all the spots where I failed to pleasure her. Laughing hard at my contorted features, she pays no more attention to me. I beg, I grovel before her, only to have her kick me away brutally. The expression of her face and the sound of her voice as she turns her attention elsewhere leave my sense of self in tatters.

Whip me more, mistress, punish me harder. Perhaps next time I shall please you sufficiently for you to let me win a game.

[b]Update[/b] A fairly recent discussion made me realise that the game of Power Grid is actually in thoroughly obfuscating the game state of every player while adding hard to quantify randomness in the form of the power plant market. This causes evaluations to become unpredictable and asymmetric. Consequently it is not always clear why the winner won as he did: it can be his evaluation, or that of another player, or just having dumb luck in the market. What is certainly not the case is there being superior strategy at work: Power Grid is not a game which supports this; and what little there is, is well known (holding back, for example). This is perhaps something to be aware of if you're looking for a deep strategic game: Power Grid certainly isn't.

Great game! Auction aspect is fun, as is building. Lots of decisions to make on every turn as you have a lot of things to consider. The only issue for me is that the game can drag a bit if you have players that struggle to make decisions as there is a lot going on and quite a few strategic options throughout the game.

Wciągająca gra ekonomiczna, nie bez powodu zajmuje tak wysoką pozycję w światowym rankingu gier BBG . Ładnie wykonana, drewniane elementy w żywych kolorach, tylko pieniądze są naprawdę wątpliwej jakości. Ustalanie kolejności graczy ponownie w każdej rundzie powoduje, że słabsi gracze mają szansę się przebić, a zdobytą przewagę nie tak łatwo utrzymać. Rywalizacja jest duża i przez całą grę sytuacja na planszy ciągle się zmienia i początkowy faworyt wcale nie musi zostać zwycięzcą. Wydatki w trakcie gry trzeba mądrze planować, żeby wygrać. Jedna z lepszych eurogier do 6 graczy, w którą można łatwo wprowadzić innych graczy, u nas na stole ląduje bardzo często. Jedna z najbrzydszych gier, w którą rewelacyjnie się gra. Już sama wersja podstawowa daje dużo emocji, ale mamy też pełen wachlarz interesujących map z różnymi mechanizmami rynkowymi, polecam szczególnie Europę Centralną/Benelux z mapą Polski.

Acquired April 2007.
First play September 1, 2007.

Favorite game found because of BGG.

There are a lot of little rules in this game, but its fairly procedural.  The number of rules kept me away for a while.  To new players, I would suggest that you print out the user guides available in the file section on BGG.

Excellent game that our family has evolved to since finding BGG.  It has replaced Monopoly as our "money" game of choice.  If you know someone who likes Monopoly, this is the game to start them out with.

Fabulous! It was particularly good after my gaming group implemented a 1-minute time constraint when connecting cities, to help avoid "analysis paralysis" (and hauling out pencil/paper) in the late game. Without time constraints, kingmaker syndrome sometimes becomes very evident as well.

Edit: Just discovered that you're supposed to play with hidden money so as to reduce AP in the last few turns. Maybe that (combined with sufficient amounts of port) would replace the timer.

Starting this at an 8 after one play. Thoroughly enjoyed it 4p, Lauren won after going toe-to-toe with Ty in an auction and paying $72 for the exact plant she needed.

Markets, route building, resource management, auctions and low luck to allow solid strategic play. I tried to bid up Peter at least three times and got stuck each time - brilliant fun!

Played again, I think it isn't the dryness I dislike.  It is the combination of a game where you need to closely calculate things and prices to the dollar in pricing a power-plant in an auction, then to have all those careful calculations destroyed by the next randomly appearing power plant.

One of my favorite games in the rotation, comes out frequently, especially when we have a lot of players. This game gets everything right: very tough decisions in competition for multiple factors, including power plants, resources, and city locations, Power Grid demands a lot of careful planning and strategic thinking from the player. Each aspect is limited and mutually exclusive, so what one player gets, another does not. Did I mention the game is competitive?

The game's balancing mechanism of giving the lead players the last crack at the resources and house placement means you can't leap ahead and expand just to expand - you had better have a good reason for each decision you make. This also means that players who have fallen behind can catch up when leaders get cut off from their objectives.

One downside of the game is that a player can get boxed into an area early on and axed out of access to other areas for expansion - but this can also result in the fortuitous situation that these players build up a huge cash reserve that they aren't spending on expansion, which they are later able to spend on a great power plant and swift expansion, when it becomes available - which often results in these players winning the game, so this isn't really a game-ruiner.

Occasionally, a player with a large cash flow saved up will happen upon an ideal power plant at just the right time, which catapults them ahead for the win, which does mean that the element of chance has a distinct presence in the game, especially where bidding on power plant auctions is a bit of a gamble, given the lack of knowledge about which plants will become available next - but this not knowing is what makes the game exciting, and gives those inclined toward risk-taking a chance to play the odds while playing their opponents - and, with any luck, come out ahead.

In all, a very satisfying game, though you have to like counting and analysis. My only real complaint is that the artwork is lacking, even though design layout and components are very nice (wooden pieces!). Seemingly endless expansions keep the game fresh and possibilities potentially limitless - can't wait to see what regions they offer next. Permanent place in my top 10 for playability.

I first borrowed this game from a friend.  Loved it enough that I went back and purchased it from him.  Love the theme of starting off as a ma & pa power company with terrible power plants and exponentially increasing your purchasing power and upgrading your power plants.  Also, I really like how some resources start out cheap, but towards the end of the game become terribly expensive, whereas the expensive ones turn around and become cheaper.  Great game!

Power Grid is a very neat game of power plant expansion and power generation with a neat geographic bent to it.  I own all of the current expansions and enjoy them all.  Timing is everything in this game and working the balance between power plants acquired, geographic locations claimed and maintaining just the right amount of cash on hand makes this game a fun, sought over classic.  The power plant replacement deck is highly recommended.  Power Grid also plays very well with 4, 5 or 6 players.  Overall, Power Grid is a well designed, good euro game with reasonable replayability - especially if you own the expansions.  Power Grid and its various expansions have made my top 50 list of euro style games of all time.

Comments on Funkenschlag:
The map is rinky dink.  It should be much larger, laminated and dry erase markers should be supplied.  That said there's a solid game to be found here.

Comments on Power Grid:
The map is a whole lot nicer, even if it's a bit much on the eyes.  Retains much of what is good about Funkenschlag, but the payout structure is a little too nice for the leader.

The first game was a bit slow with the group, but the second one was much better (and my wife won). By the time we completed our third game, we knew this was going to be one of our favorite games. It will definitely get played many times! -- My wife still says it's a men's game.

The mechanics are very simple, but it has tons of interesting strategies and meaningful decisions. One of the best games I have ever played.

RATING: 9.5
A very elegant game of economic warfare and network control. Though game board looks intimidating to new players, the game is actually very streamlined and easy to learn - provided that at least one person knows the rules very well. Unlike many eurogames, almost every action involves direct interaction between players; you step on people's toes with every auction, every purchase of resources, and every city you add to your network.

You have to do a lot of arithmetic in this game. I personally don't mind that (which is why I give it such a high rating), but that can be a major turn-off for some players. I keep calculators in the box as a player aide.

Combination of auction, balancing money and city placement works so well.  And then if someone can't work their way out with paying for additional connections it can become quite nasty too.  Still seems like a runaway leader can occur often - partly because other players (myself included) do not use the resource market to economically punish the leader sufficiently.

This is a game that benefits the one in last place and slows down the leader. Which results in a pretty tight game that the ones who are not the most accomplished benefit from and enjoy.

RATING: 9.25
This is my favorite game! Very unique game with interesting mechanics. The game gives more money to those are in the lead, but other advantages to those who are behind. Thus, you have to decide when is advantageous to pull ahead of the pack or hold back and wait for a better time. Management of your resources and money are key in this game as well. A player has to divide their resources between expanding and being more efficient. What I love most about this game is that all the decisions you make have to constantly be re-evaluated every turn. This game is all about constantly adapting to the situation at hand in order to achieve the most efficiency.

Recommended for: Those who love Euro games, who like efficiency and money management (it has a lot of number crunching), determining the value of things at auction, who like games that force you to adapt constantly.

Not recommended for: Those who don't want to be junior accountants for 2 hours, who can't stand games that hold back the leader for the sake of interaction, who want a stronger theme.

There are aspects of Power Grid that I like - timing of upgrades most of all, I think.

Still, for the amount of gameplay/time...I'd much rather play something else. I enjoy many resource management games, but not this one. A dynamic I often see in endgame - of keeping just behind on board presence to stay first in the initiative order before surging to victory - may be part of it.

2014: I haven't played in many years. My tastes have shifted; I'd like to revisit this one someday.

El mejor juego de subastas que he probado hasta la fecha. Para 2 y 3 jugadores se queda algo corto (aunque mejora con Los Robots), pero a 4 y a 5 es una verdadera joya. Interacción y puteo indirecto, pero muchas veces decisivo. El mercado de recursos le da un punto táctico muy interesante. Especial atención a su dureza, no es excesivamente complicado, pero toca darle al coco para optimizar el gasto de dinero.
Algo malo a decir: Los billetes de papel, muy feos. Y puede ser algo propenso al AP.

This is the first economic game I played, before starting my boardgaming career and making a collection...It is one of the games that convinced me to try more boardgames and to try more euros aswell(only played thematic games before).

Really good economic game, I love the auction part....you really need to know if you absolutely must have that plant or can wait for a later one(as money is scarce) and how resource management works...I like the fact that the first in line(homes wise and game wise) is the last to purchase resources which means that he will buy them at higher prices than the others...it keeps the game ballanced and avoids a runaway leader. I know a lot of people complain about the visual aspect but I think the board looks ok and it does it's job....really there are worse looking games out there.

It doesn't play in so long a time and new players catch on pretty quickly....most new people I played it with enjoyed it.

Components: Nice board, with relatively easy-to-follow pipeline connections between cities, and region demarcations (though the pipes could stand to be more narrow).  All the wooden bits, with their varying shapes and colors, add nice snazz to the game.  The power plants are depicted creatively, with each type of plant having its own style of building, which is shown grander in scale with each increase in factory value.  The dark tones on the board, and the idea of buying lots of uranium, coal, oil, and garbage are a bit depressing theme-wise.  Paper money is a disappointment, especially given how much money changes hands.

Experience: The auction phase can be tense or matter-of-fact; I enjoy recruiting the factories to my cause, trying to diversify my resource needs while being aware of cost, and deciding how much to build, and how that will affect my position in the next turn order.  Many times I find myself having to calculate exactly how much I can spend on or make from a particular option, which is a bit too much budgeting for me, but fun nonetheless. Feels like trying to balance my monthly budget.

What needs to be said that hasn't been?  A clever combination of route-building, equipment-auctioning, and shared-resource consumption.  Money will be tight for most of the game, and the player who avoids both trying to do too much and always staying on top has the best chance of succeeding in the long run.  Replay value is not bad, and is further enhanced by multiple boards for other countries now being available.

Such a well designed game. Excellent mechanism for keeping the game close. I not sure why you should have to wait until phase two to purchase the phase two city spaces. Maybe, I'm just too much of a free market guy, but I say a little compettition in a city is good.

Although I've recently been finding I do quite well at Power Grid, it has too much accountancy (save a penny here to be able to afford tuppence later) to hit any kind of sweet spot for me. The endgame in particular too often descends into a borefest in which each player can take up to ten minutes to maximise his last one or two plays (generally network expansion). 
Perhaps it could use a bit more randomness to make assessments of other players' positions less precise. I won our group's most recent game by a single electro, though I'd thought I was going to lose it by the same margin.
Nonetheless, it's certainly a 'good' game and far from the worst way to while away an hour and a half.

Finally got to play (2 player only) after it sat on my shelf looking at me for six months.  Very easy to see why this game remains popular - the rules are easily read and remembered, the play we found to be tense and the finish close(ish).  I fully expect this to improve with 3 or more players.  A great game.

Wow! Where have you been all my life? This game is my favourite "heavier" Euro game, edging out Age of Industry only because I find it less stressful and more fun to play. I can play Power Grid anytime ... Age of Industry takes a bit of mental preparation. Power Grid I want to play all the time.

Initial rating is 9 after two plays. Odd playing time. With five of us (four first timers but with a good rules teacher) it took over three hours with some elements of AP. Three player second game wrapped up in about 90 minutes. Maybe because we knew the rules, or simply didn't waste time in auctions or with AP, or made decisions too quickly, or whatever. Still fun in both instances.

A more detailed review later but for now ... brilliant game.

Revised rating to a 10 based on BGG guidelines. Every game has been a great experience and I can not see myself ever wanting to not play this game.

Gareth's game. I refuse to play it if he's playing as he - like me - can calculate the outcome in his head very far in advance. However, while I try not to do so when I'm playing games (it makes everything take longer) this is one game when it's really not too hard, about half way through the game, to know who is going to win. I rarely win games, but at least with other ones I don't know who has won half an hour before it finishes!

I like this game, but it can be a bit dry. It also seems to me that after the first few turns, the leaders of the pack and the clear stragglers are often entrenched in those positions, and once you've made your bed in the early turns, you'll be sleeping in it until the end. This can be a very different game based on the amount of players; BGG's recommended and "best with" figures are probably a lot more hard and fast than for most games.

For some reason, Power Grid just doesn't "scratch the itch" for me. It's not bad, it just doesn't give me the fun which I look for in a board game. It's the combination of the amount of arithmetic, and the feeling that I MUST solve an optimization problem on each turn -- just to stay at the base line, not even to be competitive! But once I've solved that, I'm basically done.

Do you like doing math in your head? All the time? Do you enjoy extrapolating the effects certain mathematical equations will have over the state of a game after 4, 5, 6, 7 turns? Do you appreciate the challenge of an open auction mechanic in which it is extremely difficult to determine the theoretical value of the thing you're supposed to be bidding on? Does lengthy upkeep during every turn make your heart sing?

Yeah, me either. I guess it is a "tight" game, though.

Of the games that: a) I have played b) are still in print c) that I don't own  this is my favorite. I have not given anything a 10, but I may have to give it to this game. The only reason why I don't have a copy of this and all of the expansions is the fact that a very good friend has the whole set.

Update: Okay... a 10 it is.

Update: Somehow, a friend wound up with an extra board of the original [i]Power Grid[/i] in his copy of [i]EnBW[/i] and he has kindly given it to me. I may not have the original game's box, but, between [i]EnBW[/i] and [i]Megawatts[/i], what I have is close enough.

This is a good route building game. I enjoyed my play of this game and would play this again and possibly add this to my collection.

That being said, you can be cut off from that route as well.

I've been trying to get into this one but I just don't feel that my choices sufficiently effect the game. The strategies seem obvious, the most taxing part of the game is managing your cash on hand (not saying much), and there are few if any tense/anxious moments. The map is *far* too tight and it's easy to get trapped. Initial placement is a big advantage.

This game could provide a dry experience, but within my gaming groups this just isn't so. I enjoy the tension of the auction, the ability to manipulate turn order, the rush to the end game and the frustration of being "one dollar short" to do what you want. I don't think I've seen any other game where you have to stand during the last round or two to gauge to the board position and try to make the game work for you. The expansion maps all bring a little tweak while retaining the original flavor of the game.

I love the economic tension in this game.  The turn order mechanic seems to turn other people off of this, but I think it adds to the game.  Without it, there would be no point in not building whenever you could, and so the game would come down solely to the auctions.  Instead, there is now a timing aspect.  You need to build in enough cities to earn cash, but not too many because your resources will be too expensive if you're in the lead.

We don't think it works well with 2; it always seems to come down to money, which just isn't satisfying.

Update:  With the robots, this is a fun 2 player game as well!

During my first game it felt almost like an exercise in arithmetic at times - working out how much I would spend on buildings to calculate how much I could spend on resources took long enough to get everyone irritated and actually impose a verbal 'timer'. ('going, going, gone...")

I need to play again before properly appraising this.

-------------------------------------

2nd game was far more enjoyable. A long game but an enjoyable game of optimisation with no downtime since there are always options to consider and usually you'll be able to go with your original plan. Essentially a race, it's all about efficiency within the turns you have.

RATING: 7
Great balance. Looks clunky intially, but the auction and build phases move really well as long as one person can direct the action. Fighting for good position on the board can feel like a knife-fight in a phone booth with competitive players. There is never enough money to go around as players need to carefully balance the number of cities, resources, and power plants each round.

Stay away if you don't like math or constant counting.

What makes this game fun for me is that there's more than one viable strategy that you can use regardless of what every other player is doing.  The downside is that it's almost impossible to win if you change that strategy half way through the game.  I enjoy the auction mechanic but the area control mechanic, while crucial, really serves to make the end game take FOREVER.

RATING: 10
A personal favorite. I like building games, and in this one you create a network that expands across the map. Every addition to the network is one that someone else can't have, so that combined with the auction of power plants and manipulation of the supply market make the game very interactive. Yes, I realize that the catch-up mechanism of turn order is rather contrived and makes little sense with the theme, but I enjoy trying to work the turn order to my favor. The mathy nature of the game makes it possible to plot out the endgame to some degree, but it always seems to hinge on someone being a dollar short of what they need...as good a sign of a great game as I can think of.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Initially, I thought this was a truly remarkable game.  Now I'm in the 'hmmm' category.

Almost didn't buy this because of the cheesy paper money, but I'm glad I did.  The auctioning mechanism is really fun, and so is buying up all the good real estate before the other players.  Does go on a bit long with 5-6 people though.

I find that it's a bit complicated for the family so it doesn't get brought out very often.

What an incredible dynamic this game has.

The task is to establish a network of electric power stations linking several cities. The stations are bought through an auction and, once they are supplied (with four types of fuel - coal, petrol, garbage or uranium) they start to produce income.
The income allows then to buy more fuel in the next rounds, to buy new and more efficient stations, buy the right to establish new stations in new cities, as also the costs of linking them to cities already part of our network.
There is a constant catch up mechanism based at the fact that the player coming in last (with less cities) is the first to acess the market of fuel (obtaining lower prices and sometimes doing some hoarding). Prices at this market also vary depending on demand, as was supposed.
The game quick becames addictive, as you try to expand your network, buy better stations, buy cheaper fuel, etc, making lots and lots of sum calculations, only to find you are one coin or two short of what you intendend!...
There are some small drawbacks: The process how new stations are coming to the aution is a bit confusing and the constant changes in the turn order introduce some perturbation to the flow of the game.
However, what i think is a bit anwkard is that, after some 2 hrs of hard play, the winner is decided through "photo-finish", as is usual to have several players with the same number of supplied stations and the tiebreak factor is just...to have a few more coins!
That is a pity because, otherwise, the game could rank even better.

Good game. 
Here comes why this is not a 10 for me:
- Replayability isn't high enough - after many plays it gets too repetitive
- to some degree: Not sure, if the power plants are balanced enough (i usually ignore the green ones and this has never been an issue)

RATING: 7
A bit overrated, but a decent game.  I like the artwork of the board and cards well enough.  The game is intense, but difficult for the one explaining to newbies because of the fiddliness of certain rules (and difficult to remember myself).  Once you get past that, it's a pretty good game with many unique and fun mechanisms all working at once.  What I dislike about it is how easy it is for a player to save up cash and sneak up with the end-game trigger by building a lot of cities.  This game seems to be all about timing of the end-game.  Do it correct, and you win.  Mess up, and you lose.  The $1 incrimental bidding during the auction drags the game on longer than it should as well.  I don't mind some mental calculation in games, but this one seems to bring out the worst in players.

After getting over the weirdly written rules (Thanks Rahdo)
it quickly became one of my favorite games of all time. It also taught me that my favorite mechanic is the Auction mechanic. Can take some time, but is great at any number above 4. Have played with every number from 3 to 6 and it is one of the few that i own that is still good at max number of players above 4. Very easily playable at 2 or 3 as long as you have the amazing Robots expansion.

Lowered score after more play.  On more than one occassion the person in the lead has stayed there, no matter what everyone else does to stop them, even with the game's built in bias against the leader. It goes a bit longer than my attention span whenever I've played with more than 2, but with two the auction phase is really lacking.  It is a good game for a while, but it just leaves me wanting a little more, in a slightly shorter time.  Took about three plays to get all the rules right. Update: 2/17/06  I have raised the score again after more plays.  It is very balanced overall, and you can come from behind.

This game plays fairly smoothly. Looking forward to trying it out in a larger group to see how well-balanced it is. Pretty unique and well- thought-out phases make each player balance funds for auctioning plants, resources and cities. For someone who typically plays 2 player wargames, this title has officially bridged the gap for me into economical/resource games.

An auction game combined with route placement that doesn't use trains! The auctions were tense in our 5 player game and the resource market really punished following along with other players. Using reverse bidding order for collecting resources and building routes made for an interesting decisions about when to become first and when to let others take more powerful power plants. The route building aspect has an interesting limiter at first that lets people build in their own region of the map before they need to compete with each other. I would have preferred to not have that safety net but letting other get started does make for an interesting mid-game. I would love to play this again. A bit lighter than the 18xx games but a very solid entry for 3+ players.

[14 Sep 2017] - 7.0 (1 play)
Thinking back to the auction in Power Grid and other auction games that I've played, I'm not as interested in this game. While the auctions in Power Grid are interesting and encourage players to go later in turn order, I don't think it's as dynamic or tense as Ponzi Scheme or an 18xx game. It is a lot more approachable to players who would rather play light to medium euro games and that's probably where it's charm lies. Since I do have the fortune to play these heavier games, I can't rate it as high.

I've played Power Grid with 4, 5, and 6 players now and each game has been a great experience overall. I like Power Grid a lot because it is complex in strategy, yet the rules and steps are easy enough to comprehend that I can teach it to anyone in a relatively short amount of time. The game is 2 hours, which may seem long, but believe me when I say that time flies when playing this game - you are constantly paying attention to what others are doing, and planning your next move even when it's not your turn. Plus, even when you are in last (which is an advantage in this game), you don't necessarily feel like there's no hope left in the game - you have first dibs when it comes to buying resources and building in cities. The auction phase is a lot of fun, too...can be a bit of a psychological battle :-). I can't wait to play Power Grid even more, and I suspect my 10 rating will not change over time for this game.

RATING: 7
Still figuring out end-game strategies. The game is not particularly fun with 2 players. But 4,5,6 and the auction phase and limited resource markets take off.

It's enjoyable.

2010 Update: It's fun with two players - we were just making the rooking mistakes of constantly upgrading power plants instead of far less frequent, strategic, buying. When the game is played in that manner, the two players find themselves often bidding for the same power plants. Much more fun and the game goes quickly.

2011 Update: A game is only fun if the other gamers in your circle like/want to play it. There's something missing here... I think the game requires too much bookkeeping at the end of each round for most players. We've also noticed that new players don't like the "unfair" maps. (The maps aren't unfair - it just seems that way.)

Power grid is a simple strategy game with a focus on resource management.  Despite the nearly unreadable rule book (one of the worst I've ever seen), the game is actually easy to learn and enjoy from the first play.  It scales well, although turn order can become confusing in larger games.  Early mistakes can mean certain failure, as there is no "catch-up" mechanic.  This means if someone has an early lead, it's highly likely they will win.  The auction system is an enjoyable mechanic, and fits nicely with the theme.  The board design is elegant and the wooden pieces are solid quality.  The paper money that comes with the game can really slow things down, so I suggest using poker chips instead.  Biggest con for this game is the poorly written rule book.  Learn the game from someone who knows it, or watch a tutorial online.

This is one of those games that I keep coming back too.  That it's on BSW is a bonus too.  I really don't care much about the theme, but it's mechanically slick.

The biggest downside is the amount of addition.  Personally, I don't mind this as I can add quickly.  However, this can really ratchet up the AP, especially with all the engineers that I game with.  When the calculator comes out, I know that I've had enough.  This game is a lot of fun to play by the seat of your pants.  It's tedious to play it when opponents insist on calculating every little expense for a turn.  I think that I'll get a 30 second timer for the game.  I'll allow one extra 30 secs once per game (since it can matter in the end).  I'm leaving the rating alone for now, but I could definitely sour further.  I highly recommend BSW on this one since there's virtually no AP.

Update: dude, whateva!  This game rocks and I love it.  Some of the expansions kinda suck, but some are sublime.  I even like the new edition.

Update 2017: I take back what I said about the new edition--it's ok, but the power plant deck is just a little too nice for my taste.

2-6

Doel :

Het spel is afgelopen na fase 4 van de ronde waarin één of meer spelers 17 of meer steden hebben aangesloten! De speler die de meeste steden van energie kan voorzien wint het spel. Bij gelijke stand wint de speler met het meeste geld!

Voorbereiding:

+ Iedere speler kiest 1 gebied op het speelbord. Opgelet, alle gekozen gebieden moeten aan elkaar grenzen.
+ Iedere speler kiest een kleur, neemt een overzichtskaart en 50 Elektro.
+ Vul de brandstoffenmarkt aan.
+ Leg de centrales (03 tem 10) in 2 horizontale rijen. Sorteer hen op nummer! De bovenste rij is het actuele aanbod.
+ Schud de overige kaarten. Leg kaart 13 bovenop de stapel en kaart “periode 3” onderaan de stapel.

Speelverloop:

Iedere speelronde speelt zich af in een periode. Het spel start in periode 1! Elke speelronde bestaat uit 5 fasen:

Fase 1: Beurtvolgorde bepalen:

De speler met de meeste aangesloten steden (steden met een huisje) zet zijn huisje op positie 1 van het beurtvolgorde spoor, enzovoort.... Bij gelijke stand zet de speler met de centrale met het hoogste nummer als eerste zijn huisje op het beurtvolgordespoor!

Fase 2: Centrales veilen:

Er zijn twee opties: passen of veilen

1/ Passen: De speler kiest ervoor om geen centrale te veilen! Hij mag aan geen veilingen meer deelnemen.

2/ Veilen: Een speler kiest een centrale uit het actuele aanbod en doet een openingsbod (minimum het nummer van de centrale). Alle spelers mogen kloksgewijs beginnen bieden! Als je eenmaal past, mag je geen bod meer uitbrengen. Indien een andere speler de centrale kocht, dan mag de actieve speler terug kiezen tussen veilen of passen. In de 1ste ronde moet iedereen een centrale kopen!!

Fase 3: Brandstoffen kopen:

Deze fase wordt in omgekeerde beurtvolgorde gespeeld! Wie aan de beurt is mag zoveel brandstoffen kopen als hij wil, maar hij moet rekening houden met de opslagcapaciteit van zijn centrales. Een maximum opslag van 2x het afgebeelde symbool!

Fase 4: Bouwen:

Deze fase wordt in omgekeerde beurtvolgorde gespeeld! Een speler mag zoveel aansluitingen (huisjes) maken als hij wil, zolang hij de aansluitkosten en netwerkkosten maar kan betalen!

Fase 5: Inkomsten nemen en volgende ronde voorbereiden:

Iedere speler, beginnend met de startspeler, voorziet zijn steden van stroom! Hiervoor ontvangt hij geld (zie overzichtskaart). Een teveel aan stroom levert niks op! Als iedereen aan de beurt is geweest, vul dan de brandstoffenmarkt aan.

Belangrijke regels:

+ Een speler mag nooit meer dan 3 centrales bezitten. Als hij een vierde koopt, moet hij direct één van zijn 4 centrales verwijderen.
+ Als geen enkele speler een centrale koopt, verwijder dan de centrale met het laagste nummer.
+ Brandstoffen mag je steeds herverdelen over je centrales, je moet wel rekening houden met de opslagcapaciteit van de centrales.
+ Een speler mag niet meerdere malen een stad aansluiten.
+ Een speler moet altijd op het goedkoopst beschikbare veld een huisje bouwen.
+ In de 1ste ronde moet je een centrale kopen en een stad aansluiten.
+ Als zich in het actuele aanbod een centrale bevindt met een nummer gelijk aan of lager dan het aantal steden van de leidende speler is, dan wordt deze direct uit het spel verwijderd en vervangen door een nieuwe.
+ Als de kaart “transformatiestation” verschijnt, dan wordt het spel onderbroken voor een extra veiling. Het maakt niet uit in welke fase dit gebeurt.

PERIODE 1: 
+ start aan het begin van het spel.
+ in fase 5: verwijder de centrale met het hoogste nummer uit het toekomstige aanbod en trek een nieuwe.
+ in fase 4: Er mag maar 1 aansluiting zijn per stad! Kost = 10 Elektro

PERIODE 2:
+ start als een speler zijn zevende stad heeft aangesloten.
+ in fase 5: verwijder de centrale met het hoogste nummer uit het toekomstige aanbod en trek een nieuwe.
+ in fase 4: Er mogen 2 aansluitingen zijn per stad! Kost = 15 Elektro

PERIODE 3:
+ start als de kaart periode 3 wordt getrokken.
+ in fase 5: verwijder de centrale met het laagste nummer uit het spel! Er bestaat geen toekomstig aanbod meer. Er worden 6 centrales geveild!
+ in fase 4: Er mogen 3 aansluitingen zijn per stad! Kost = 20 Elektro

Enjoyed first 6-player game, though I think we may have got some of the rules slightly wrong. Played to 17 instead of 14. (That said, rate of expansion was high near the end, so probably only took us one extra turn. But there was a lot of contention is some parts of the board, so going to 17 might have given an advantage to those who had more space available to them.) Perhaps not a great game for those prone to AP (like me)

Starts slow (Step 1) and rules can be a 20-25 minute barrier. Is extremely mathy/AP-inducing but you know you're playing a good game when players magically start getting invested in the game when you see them standing near the end of Step 2 trying their best to stop the 1st/leading player from winning. A play once every 4 months kind of game.

Great equalizing "randomness" tactics, unsurprisingly similar to Puerto Rico. Also similar is the nagging "public if you kept track" mechanic for hidden money, which can get annoying when trying to plan out strategy.

RATING: 9
Absorbing and tangible.  Some heavy games are too deep for me but in PG I feel in control.  Mechanisms are there to prevent runaway leader but not excessively punishing.  Board control is king; do not let yourself get boxed in.  Plant market is cool.  The solution to pollution is dilution, don't be dazzled by the false promise of clean power.  Must make buzzing noises when powering your plants.  Fun!!!  Can suffer from "The writing on the wall": some players will be completely out of it two turns before the end, and know it.

Still quite good and my ranking remains unchanged. Finally played against more experienced players and that certainly brought more of a challenge, which was good, but I'm beginning to observe that there are only a narrow set of paths to victory. Yes, the market and bidding and what other players do may change that strategy slightly, but not by much. And boy, make one or two mistakes in this game and you can be done.

[August 2014 - 8.0]
This is a game I'm good at. I picked up the mechanics and economics quickly. I understand the balance of the game and the importance of the final two rounds. For that, it's perhaps lost a little for me personally, but I think it's still a very solid game, and I'd be interested to play against more experienced players. Note: I'm not the best at math, but in this game, it's needed. Fortunately, there are only a few variables to account for, plus plenty of time to run through the numbers while the other players take their turns.

I like this game, and I don't like this game.  It is the game played the most by our regular group...and, I must admit, I am excited each time it comes out...but there is a point, close to the end, where I feel it is all determined by end game luck...not what I want in a top rated game.

Step up from Settlers of Catan so easy to teach and get people to game; drawback (small ) is 2 hour playing time. Pieces look great; wooden meeples for 'fuel' needed by power plants. Serious problems with mid-game power plants that are too expensive and the ridiculous end-of-game resource exhaustion problem. Needs at least 4-6 to be good (not 2 or 3).

It takes a long time to play, but is totally worth it.  Rarely have I seen a game so well designed and balanced.

Plant capacity wins the game.  Being in the lead hamstrings your ability to grow capacity.  Don't pass on chances to do so.

Don't expand beyond your ability to power expecting to buy capacity in the next round.  This is doubly true if you're in the lead.

It's worth it to save money on supplies when possible.  Fuel is the one cost in the game that you don't earn anything directly from.

The game ends when the requisite number of cities have been built, not when the requisite number of cities have been powered.  This is how you push ahead as the game leader to win: grab cities first, expecting that you won't be able to supply them all, but rather that you'll be able to supply more than your opponents who have been left behind.

When the step 3 card comes up, players will be able to take the third spot in each city on that turn.  Try to stockpile money in expectation.

Like the bidding aspect of the game.
Like how player turn order enables newer players to catch up.
Can see why people say the drawing of the plant deck increases the luck factor.
My two games have always finished very 'close' and by close I mean the small spread in the number of powered cities of each player at the end of the game.

I find this a tiny bit tedious to play. The math (really arithmetic and by arithmetic I specifically mean 3 operations: addition, subtraction, and multiplication) is annoying. The arithmetic is easy for people I play with but there's still an annoying amount of total time spent (wasted) calculating costs and change (change as in the kind of change when you pay $50 for something costing $27). The constant need to do arithmetic also disrupts the flow of the game, in my opinion. (We use poker chips instead of the paper money provided by the game.) Getting change is also annoying. Perhaps using paper and pen to keep track of money, so that we don't have to grab our change, is a better idea than using poker chips. In fact, I'll try that out next time.

RATING: 9
This could be a perfect 10, if it weren't for two things: too much work calculating the costs of buildings at the latter stages, and too strong catch the leader mechanism leading to a strange playing tactics, where one almost has to make some suboptimal decisions to stay away from the leading position, which in a way of course then makes those suboptimal decisions optimal, but somehow leaves one feeling a bit dissatisfied with the proceedings.  The preceding sentence probably makes no sense, if you've never played the game, but play it, and you'll see right away what I meant.  Still, these are relatively minor issues.  Power Grid is an excellent game, and a very simple one to get into, even for newbies to gaming.

The first playthrough of the game is a bit clunky as players don't know how much each power plant is really worth. However, once you play with 3-4 other people that have experience in the game it becomes an absolute rush. After you're about halfway through phase 2, you've had enough time to forget exactly how much money everyone has and the bidding becomes much more intense. There's nothing better than having a showdown with the person across from you for an awesome power plant that somehow slipped down to the buying row. It's almost a game with chicken of high how are you willing to pay. My only complaint is that the end of the game can sometimes be a little anticlimatic. If one person hoards money and buys 5 cities on the last turn to bum rush to 17, it can feel like a bit of a let down to other players who aren't expecting the game to end. Also, the more the merrier in this game.

I love this game and all its expansions. It's an economic efficiency game with conflict thrown in by other players just simply because resources are limited (they cost more as they become more scarce) and empty city spaces become filled up. I like the self-compensating nature of the game, making it very difficult for there to be a runaway leader till the end. I have seen many beginners win; I won on my very first game with 5 experienced, cutthroat players.

Lots of tough decisions to make. Requires a delicate balancing act of staying behind in the city count to get the best powerplants/fuel vs building cities in order not to get shut out of the less expensive available cities.  Unfortunately the end of the game kind of fizzles a bit, but still a great game.  Update: Downgraded from 8 to 7.  After many plays, I've come to the conclusion that most games stall out right before Step 2.  Nobody wants to build the critical city to enter step 2 because then they build last the next turn.

Power Grid is a perfectly fine game, but one that I ultimately fine to be unsatisfying. The decision structure established in the game seems to be better-implemented in other, superior titles and I simply have no desire to play it anymore. It is too much of a gateway game into real economic games. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Excellent business/planning game where players are attempting to run power to an increasing number of cities.  Players link the cities "crayon rail game" style (or in the new edition, by simply placing wooden houses in cities on the printed power grid), via drawing on the mapsheet and run the power by picking up power plants at auction.  Money is earned based on cities powered and is used for better plants, the resources to run them, and further power links.  Great game.

RATING: 9
Power Grid is one of just a handful of games that elevates my pulse and increases my blood pressure. I have so many great things to say about this game: the tense auctions, the psychology, the jockeying for turn order, the screwage factor, the spatial aspect, the resource market and resource management, and more. The only thing that keeps it from being a 10 for me is the AP-inducing connection cost calculations, especially towards the end of the game.

UPDATE: I've decided it's a 10 anyway.

Not a game I've played very much, but I've loved the few plays that I have had. The commodities market is really cool, and I enjoy the money management aspect of the game. I'm so-so on the power plant auction mechanic; it creates some good interaction, but it seems a little cumbersome/contrived to me (although a lot of reviewers rave about it). My only real negative is the board artwork. Am I the only person who thinks it's ugly? But I can get past that because of the awesome gameplay.

[Friese] Excellent economic-themed game with a LOT to like. The incremental decisions and the fact that you don't even completely block other players out makes this one a winner over many similar rail games. 

My reservations are that this is a mathy calculating game that has a lot of pointless auctions. A lot of the game is waiting for the right plant to come up and trigger another phase of the game...

Rather dull game with a lot of downtime. This one fails to keep my interest.

Heavier Euro game.  Auction mechanic, and great phases drive everyone to compete.  We've played a couple of times wrong (mostlydue to card/auction misunderstandings), but still loved the games
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Idea:
Power most cities when game ends. Get money from cities powered. Powerplants are auctioned. All about handling your playing position compared to your resoureces.

Mechanism:
Each round first bid for plants -> buy resources -> buy cities -> fire plants. Has very strong strategy as one who leads does bidding/passing first thus last player gets best chances to buy best plant cheapest and last player buys resources/cities first thus first player pays most for resources/cities.

To whom:
Classic game that really needs some strategy to keep yourself in competition. Simple to teach, very hard to master. Good with 3-5(6) players but playable 1vs1 too for quite many games

Playable online at BSW.

This game is brilliant, and a complete brain melter as you constantly calculate the most efficient way to take each turn. Amazingly well balanced and incredibly competitive, this game is definitely a classic.

Very neat strategical and planning experience.  Kind of fun trying to optimize everything.  It's a game I need to play again to get a good feel for.  I don't know how fun it would be after repeated plays.  Also, it's very mathematical and analytical which doesn't often appeal to our crowd of gamers.  A few more plays and I could see this one rising in my estimation.

I have played this game several times now (because my friends enjoy it and we can play with a lot of players), and every time I hear someone suggest we play I die a little inside. For me, this game actually gets worse the more you play it. It is too easy to get trapped by a bad area with no mechanics to overcome it.  Every time I have played, about half way through, you already know who can win and who can't. At that point, the "losers" are just playing to generate excitement, which usually means overbidding and buying resources just to drive up prices.  Additionally, the art is bad. The game board has so much going on it is visually unappealing. The concept of building power stations is a snooze fest.  And, the "alternate" maps are really just the same thing in a different country. Plus, having to isolate one region on the map is dumb and creates unnecessary decision-making strategies before the game even begins. In fairness, I haven't played it with less than 5 people. Maybe it's better with fewer people. Right now, I generously gave it a "4" only because my friends enjoy it so much.

This is another one of those games that replaces Monopoly for me. If anyone ever comes to my house and asks "Wanna play Monopoly?", after I scold them and the game and laugh in their face (kidding... kinda), I recommend playing this or Catan instead. Power Grid is great and interesting in that you have an auction system that players utilize to purchase new power stations. Be the company that has the most efficient power stations and can power all of your cities and you win! Would like to see this hit the table more but, it can be kind of long and drug out... meh, I like it!

Interesting mechanisms and colorful pieces and artwork make this game fun. The auctioning of power plants creates constant interaction, and the rising cost market for resources helps keep any one player from getting too far ahead. PG is balanced well. After a while, though, it begins to feel like the game goes on too long.

Power Grid is an oddity to me. Despite high-rankings on BGG, a strong theme and my own personal enjoyment of it, it's still one of the most dry games in my collection. Rounds are very number heavy, as you seek the most efficient way to spend as much of your money on a round, so that you can make even more for the next round. The theme tends to fall off a little as you start dealing with larger numbers.

Dryness aside, only major complaint I could level at the game is the massive snowball effect. Yes, the game is tuned so that the player further ahead is technically at the largest disadvantage, but players can get around this easily by careful stockpiling (clearly winning, but not putting it onto the board to reap the benefits of not being in front) or brute force (players who are rich enough don't even notice the disadvantages leveled against them.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
All the math going on suggests I shouldn't like Power Grid, but I do. There's some screwage going on, but most of it doesn't happen on the map, but during auctions and the purchasing of resources. Both tactical and strategical. My only complaint would be how random elements near the end can have such a big influence on the outcome of the game.

I really like this game. Managing your economy and staying behind or shooting ahead at the right time adds a lot of depth to the game.

RATING: 8
A classic auction game where I’ve seen some of the most intense bidding in any game ever!  The game has several fantastic mechanisms in place to make it well balanced.  The catch-up mechanism is a work of genius and prevents a runaway leader from getting too far ahead and allows players that fall behind to quickly catch up and take the lead.  

Unfortunately, there are a few issues with the game: 
-The rulebook is, hands down, one of the WORST written I have ever seen.  We’ve had players who were lawyers and paralegals conjecture over the interpretations of some of its clauses.  The language is very ambiguous and not clear at all (nor is the layout).  For example, “We recommend one area per player”: they “RECOMMEND”; and this has caused many to believe they MUST block out certain portions of the board based on the number of players.  However the writer only says “recommend”: I wish they would elaborate on what they mean by “recommend.”  Also the terms “step”, “phase” and “round” got somewhat lost in translation as I know just about everyone I play with gets these terms confused since they are not used in the game in a way that is natural to native-English speakers.  I think when Henning Kropke and Jay Tummelson translated the rules, they tried to keep it too similar to the original German: the book really needs to be completely re-written in English that is more clear and precise to native English speakers.   

-The layout of the rules is a not very smooth.  They put some of the most important rules at the END of each section under the banner “Important” or “Remember” or “Exception”.  This is important information that should be in the main text and not added at the end of a section as if its an appendix.  You need to present data in a much more logical progression and not jumping all over the place.  In its current state, it’s very scattered.    

-the font used of the rulebook is far too tiny (did the graphic designer of the book take ANY Print Design Layout classes?)  For example, the setup of the resource market is buried in tiny text in a paragraph; did the Graphic Designer ever consider putting this very important information into a table, or perhaps even make it bold???   

-To make the game so balanced, the rules are very fiddly, especially regarding the re-arrangement of the power-plants at the end of each auction (which can start to feel burdensome at times).  That, combined with the fact the rulebook is so poorly written, leads me to think half the people out there are not playing the game correctly.  (I know the first few times I played with one gaming group, the lead-player introducing the game was un-knowingly not shuffling/re-stocking the power plants correctly).  

-Some of the maps are also not very well balanced.  Generally, Power Grid works best with the maximum number of players and with the map of Germany.  The US map does not seem as well balanced as we’ve found that players who start out by dominating the Northeast Coast always seem to win.   (The United Kingdom map seems very good, Japan not as much due to it being a long and slender island).  
 
-While I don’t think the math is as much of a problem as some of the BGG commentators have stated, I have found that some players are so good at the game that they will shut the game down early before they have technically won because they’ve worked out that they’ve already won several moves in advance and no one can possibly catch up.  To me the fun of the game is in the auctions and not the statistical calculations made to win the game in a certain number of moves.  It might be best to consider who you play this game with; some people play this game at a completely different level than others and so its best to play with players at your same level (sometimes that catch-up mechanism just isn’t enough).   

Still, this is a great game when played correctly with the right people (and the maximum number of people) and a good map, but come on Rio Grande… you seriously need to do something about that awful English rulebook!

This game has a turn mechanism that is just sheer genius. That element coupled with its competitive auctions and creative supply/demand feature, make this a very enjoyable game.

[b]6.8.09 Update:[/b] Played this again recently, and was reminded just how good this game is. I love the market mechanism and balance of tension. My rating goes up a tick!

[b]9.6.11 Update:[/b] My opinion of this game has really taken a beating over the last few plays. All the math involved really begs for it to be bogged down in AP, thus resulting in a crazy long game. The length coupled with the dry math creates a very small target audience for this one. It disappoints me, because I really like it, but if it's hard to get to the table, then it doesn't matter how good it is, it's value takes a hit. It pains me to say, but my rating goes down and I'm removing it from my Top 10.

Misinterpreted a rule that impacted the way we played this for a long time. Now that we got that straightened out, it's better. I like the fact that you have to balance power plant purchases, resources and house building. I don't like the fact that at the end of the game a player in 3rd or 4th place can often dictate who the winner ends up being.

PG is a game that I like, but not enough to play all the time.  I have a bunch of the accessories, I just don't get it to the table that much anymore.  

It loses something if you play it with people who are too slow, and those who are either hyper-competitive or entirely passive.  It's not as interesting with only 3, but adding players above 4 takes the length above what I prefer.  So, you have to play it at the right time and place to get the most out of it.  
There are so many options that you only get to see each individual configuration rarely.  I can't complain too much, as I like the variety, and it's not fair to knock the 2-map base game for this.  Somehow, though, I frequently seem to wind up in games with new players, and playing the US all the time gets old fast.  

The game is very mathy, and it can end very suddenly, but it can also drag out in a big slog.  That's why I don't always feel like playing it, but I still like having it in my collection.

I played this game at a convention on a big blown up board with light up power plants and a full player count and it was the best gaming experience I have ever had. The game was incredibly tense and came down to a small amount of money deciding the winner. The auctions are engaging. Definitely a game that needs a high player count to reach its full potential but I will try to seek this out whenever I can.

When I started to get serious into board gaming hobbies, I had this game for a while in my wishlist. The fact that it is using paper money and involves auction/bidding, made me put this game out from the list.
Now after a year, the game made a come back into my wishlist after a local FOLGS organized a Power Grid Tournament.
Back then, I didn't like auction/bidding mechanic but now I'm open to accept it. I was surprised that this game can actually accommodate up to 6 players, silly me for overlooked at it.

I'm planning to use the circular dicks found in Agricola to replace the paper money in Power Grid, only after I get the Agricola Goodies first.

Update1: 

(After 1st play) I have to say that I kind of like the game, not so much that I will buy it straightaway. Best features that I like from the game is that there's bidding (this is one of the best candidate as I do not own bidding game) and it can support up to 6 players. The game has won lots of awards and till now, still top the charts and poll. I may need to give this game another try. The "math" in the game didn't really bothers me, but I think, one day, I will eventually own this.

Solid, old, economic Euro game, not arguably the best design of Friedemann Friese. It has fantastic thematic background about supplying power to households covered by your company which has to acquire power plants by auctioning and compete for cheap fuel. However it is remarkably bland, almost impossible to be played competitively without calculator and catch-up mechanics force players speculate and chase the last place from turn to turn. I have low desire to play it often, but I would like to try some different maps (I've played with Germany only).

[b]Favorite mechanism:[/b] Resource track which fluctuate from turn to turn by the laws of supply and demand. Also expensive resources (like uranium) go cheaper and cheap resources (like coal) go more expensive.

Once you have the grasp on the complex "Bureaucracy" phase, and trudged through the medium-quality rulebook, this is a great game. The theme is well implemented and fairly concrete for non-gamers as well (everybody knows what power plants do and the importance of powering cities). The balancing is also very good.

This is a solid game and there's not much I can say that hasn't already been said.  The only real hit against it, to me, is the length of time it takes to play the game - I am not shy of any long game, don't get me wrong.  It's more that for the amount of time it takes to play this game, especially among AP-happy people, I don't feel like the end result was worth it.  That is to say that for the hours you spend on it, it's a bit on the dry side.  Oh, and of course the PAPER EFFING MONEY... it's ONE-SIDED!!!

However, that's not to say I'll never play it.  Looking forward to playing it again.

Power grid is a really fun game that works well with 2-4 players. It kind of reminds you of Ticket to Ride at first, but I find Power grid much more enjoyable.

It doesn't really hold my interest. There are better games out there which are better than this one. Why would you spend time playing a bad game when you can play a game which is more worth your time and enjoyment?

It's repetitive, some luck. How economics works in Power Grid is interesting. You can actually run out of resources to buy. It's a major burn when your that player who can't fire up all his plants at the last turn and lose the game cause of it.

Rating: 5.25

UPDATE:

Lately I have been playing Power Grid a lot more since a good friend of mine bought two of the expansions. 

My overall rating has gone up since trying the expansions. The main reason why my original rating was low was because playing on the same maps is always the same I thought. Players has always the same starting areas so there isn't a different feel from game to game. Same spot, same costs from city to city. The only variation is what plants you buy.

With the expansions, its replay value has gone up from a 5.25 to 7. I guess over time and more games played, I warmed up more to the game. It's better than I first thought. I enjoy it more with 5-6 players. It`s more fun when you have access to the whole map.

Great game. I'd actually give it a nine, but the rules with shuffling the cards are a bit fiddly. Most of my games with four or five people have been agonizingly close, which speaks to a well-balanced board (or equally incompetent players).

RATING: 9
Wow. This is a nice game in every respect. Terrific components, multiple strategies, relatively easy to learn. Plays in about 2 hours, which eliminates it from the 'new gamer' crowd, but this is a fine game. I have just recently purchased this and may upgrade my rating in the future as I play it more. 1-5-2005: Now that I've played this one a number of times I've raised my rating to a 9. This game is awesome. Plus, it now helps that we play it correctly.

RATING: 6
Only works well with the right number of players for the particular map. I've recently found a little bit more strategy in terms of planning power plant churn, but it still seems like it's mostly number crunching.

Update: Okay, it *can* be fine with lower numbers of players - but with inexperienced players, the strange shape of the link cost graph results in lopsided positions. This isn't a problem with experienced players.

Has been dragging a lot through the midgame as people refuse to buy the midgame plants, waiting for the endgame plants to be available.

Solid game.  Much like with 7 Wonders, Formula D and all other racing games, I don't understand people's adoration of this game though.  Every game is essentially the same depending on map and plants you use and even those don't vary the game the strategy up enough for my taste.  Compared to Agricola this game is really rather a rote and repetitive, regurgitated romp.  Still of the many overrated games I'm gonna try to set people straight about, it is by far the most palatable.

A euro game that really makes you think a lot. For anyone who likes doing a lot of math during playing it's a great fit. For me it depends a lot of how I feel that day. Very easy to learn but has a lot of depth to the strategies. A little too much downtime between turns though.

This game is long and the rules are easy enough (I think).  The meat of the game comes from the numerous interactions of players and managing your money.  Can cause some serious brain drain.

The only fault is that some locations are hazardous to your chances of winning.  If you have to start in a zone such as the western US, well... tough.

Power Grid is clearly a good game but, as identified by others, falls a bit short for 2 players.  The Robots expansion supposedly makes this better but seems to me to be more trouble than it's worth.  I've had one game with 3 players and found it to be far better.

This is a great auction/bidding game for multiple players, not so good with two. I believe there is a great game in here, but the design and rule explanation is terrible. I could explain this game to a degree, but felt newcomers were always at a disadvantage in the endgame, which is the most critical point in the game. I severely disliked 'blocking off' areas of the board to scale for players, it just looks ugly. Still, this is a classic and should be played by all, just make sure players understand when they are bidding far too much...

60-90m, best with 4-5 players. 5+ plays.

RATING: 8
UPDATE: It's still a great game, but I think I'd recommend Concordia over this because it gives most of the experience as PG with about a tenth of the rule set.

UPDATE: It's a good game. Yeah, there are a lot of moving parts but it's also one of those games where you can assign everyone a task for upkeep and that helps a lot. I enjoy the market manipulation as well as the area control and maintaining your own network. (Honestly, I think PG has one of the more interesting and elegant depictions of free markets in board games)

This is one of those games that I like in theory more than in practice. I think it's really well designed and gives you a lot of gameplay for the effort. I like how the markets are simulated. Also, all the expansion maps really add to the fun.

HOWEVER, this game is a really "high-maintenance" game. Lots of pieces to move about. Lots of cards to move around. Markets to replenish. Is it step three or step two? How many oil squares to I refill for a four-player game in step two? Argh. all the bookkeeping really distracts me from all the strategy (and if you miscalculate by a dollar, you're screwed). I generally prefer my games to be a little less fiddly.

It took multiple plays before I actually started liking the game.  The game is extremely fickle and I feel like the smallest mistake can cause you to lose the game, and this is annoying when it happens early on maybe even after the first building phase in the first round by getting blocked by someone else.  The game has a huge learning curve to pick up on the nuances needed to win.  The game also plays very differently depending on the number of players.  Overall good and I respect it's design but I feel there are better choices out there.

This or Caylus is probably my favorite strategy game of all time. It would get a 10, but it says 2-6 players on the box. Two players is not worthy of a 10, in my opinion. Still fun to play, but there isn't as much tension in the city placement.

An excellent game of mainly bidding and going up to the next level at the right time, in this way similar to games like "Outpost" in a way. But in contrast to these games this game sometimes rewards careful play, stockpiling of money and waiting for the right moment more, so it makes for a nailbiting experience. Played with pro gamers this is a geek fest par excellence, as you judge each bid and constantly look out for the turn order, fearing you will not be able to pay for those resources or they won't even be there anymore. Complex, without being complicated.

This game is great.  Once in a while.  The first 10 or so plays were nice, after that, I started to avoid the game.  Now it's ok to break out on a yearly basis.

I loved the game when I first got it.  Now I kind of dread playing it.  The expansions keep it fresh, but your still playing the same game.  

It always feels like the game comes down to some luck in buying good power plants, and positioning yourself in a pack behind the leader.  All in all the accounting of the game is terribly dull, trying to keep in the last place while really competing for the lead.

Screams, "EURO!" which often keeps it off the table. The theme is there, but is super dry. Also, there is a substantial risk of A.P. and the game can crawl on for eons. Decent come-from-behind mechanics, but the lead player stills holds the advantage. The market system is fabulous, and the different maps add a nice boost of variety to this game. I love this game; especially when I have exact change to complete my turn, but my opponent is left a dollar short. If it was shorter, it might be a favorite.

A game that starts very slowly but gets more and more tense after reaching stage 2. The turn order mechanic is very neat, and ensures that there are always tough decisions to make.

Good timing, some forward-thinking calculations and changing the gears almost every turn are the key aspects of the game that makes for a special gaming experience.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is a solid game, which is I generally enjoy, nevertheless, I don't count it as a favorite, perhaps because 

1) Auctioning isn't really my favorite mechanism,
2) There is somewhat too much luck in the power plant draws
3) The calculations can get a little bit tedious, particularly in later turns

None of these are reason enough not to play it, but they are enough to damper my enthusiasm down to a 7.5

Update 4/27/2016 - Actually, I think that I do like auctions plenty well enough. Santiago and Goa, for example, are solid 8s. So it is really the random power plant draws that take this down a notch. It's still pretty good, though, and has the added benefit of being relatively easy to teach - a good step up from Settlers.

Simple ruleset but gives a good feel of building and powering a electrical grid. Good job of theming here.

And don't ever play this game with 2 players.

Where Pandemic requires precision in unison, Power Grid demands calculated measure of each action between you and your opponents. You really need to clear your mind and process the wisest choices to be victor of this simulated capitalist venture.

Now that I've scared off the most casual players, let me say that the game offers indelible exultation while impressing strategic after-thoughts into the wake of your following days.  For a seemingly dry theme, get any competitive individual to play a couple of rounds and he will begin to embrace the quiet viciousness inherent.

Muy bueno, la clave es intentar comprar las centrales que son capaces de suministrar electricidad a mí­nimo 6 ciudades y tener una central que pueda producir energí­a para 7 ciudades; si no haces eso es prácticamente imposible ganar.El juego tiene un tramo que parece que es lento pero es justo ahí donde hemos de estar listos porque eso querrá decir que estará a punto de acabar. Controla a los demás jugadores; es un juego donde tu crees que vas a dar la sorpresa pero los demás están igual que tú.

Most every game ends before it ends -- the winner can be proven a round or two early (particularly if you play with open money). Even with that half-drawback, however, I'd place Power Grid right up there in the top tier of boardgaming with Age of Steam, Container, and The Princes of Florence.

RATING: 9.75
Nice, unique design with quality pieces and artwork. Well balanced with no luck factor. learning curve is minimal, setup and tear down is not bad.  Fair amount of rule referencing, at least initially. Slight chance of run-away leader but I don't mark a game down for that...best player should win.  Great game.

(As of [b]1[/b] play) Surprisingly not as complex or math-y as I had feared. A solid economic game focused on optimal money management. Quite a lot of player interaction through the power plant auction, city placement and resource buying (the resource supply-and-demand mechanic is particularly cool). One of the better mid-weight Euros I have come across.

It's a popular game, but between my wife, myself, and our two gamer neighbors, none of us like it. Very repetitive, so by the time the game got to the end, ALL of us were glad it was over, and we didn't even care who won.

Every time I play it, I like it less. Just too calculable in the end, making it a math chore and removing any hope of playing intuitively (if you have aspirations of not finishing in last).

RATING: 7
Classic game, but arithmetically heavy.  General consensus is that it's a bit too mathematical/complex, and that was my experience after one play. Timing and turn order in this game is critical, and the way the turn order mechanism of this game works is brilliant (see [thread=728129]discussion[/thread]).

Great tutorial for learning the game [url=http://legacyoffun.com/gameguides/power_grid/]here[/url], plus [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Power_Grid_FAQ]FAQ[/url], [thread=881531]setup & management tips[/thread], and [filepage=32681]printable reference[/filepage].

Takes 2-3 hours with experienced players, our first four player game took about 3.5 hours.  To play well, you need to do constant calculating, which becomes painful with AP players, and quite intense.  Great game, just not for me.

There are so many things I love about this game.  The way in which newer plants become available, the resource market and the ways to affect it, and on and on.  It's a gamer's game, though, so I find it difficult to get it to the table as often as I like.

A classic of the modern era, though I’ve tired of it greatly since the halcyon days of my re-entry into gaming in the late 2000s. Back in the 2000s when auctions were considered a great idea for balancing a game (the players do it themselves via the bidding!), I enjoyed the challenge of managing the tempo (on different maps). I loved it back then and played dozens of games on table and online. 

But now I find the game is fragile to inexperienced players and the way plants come out in the market. This design feels totally played out to me at this point. I'd much rather play Princes of Florence for an old school auction game.

the auction portion of the game is great, but the rest of the game seems to leave me very cold. I prefer games that reward good instincts, like Martin Wallace's Brass:
"he who spends least goes first" as opposed to this sequence "he who appears to be falling behind goes first"

worth play once a year at best; Funny Friends is better, as that game is all-auction and instinct based.

Re-visited: this is an evergreen title, my whining about anything in this game is to be ignored.

Power Grid and Funkenschlag are different (though related) games.  I rate Funkenschlag an '8', but Power Grid is a '9' because it's cleaner, faster and not quite as punitive for the player who is in the lead.  Despite the luck introduced by the order in which the power plants come out, skill matters a lot---the better players will win significantly more often than pure chance would suggest is plausible.

I love this game.

There is a delicious and complex interplay in the competition for the power plants, resources and building sites.  One must judge the value of each choice relative to its cost, all the while carefully managing one's money and paying attention to what the others are doing.  There is a real art to anticipating and positioning oneself for each stage and for the end game.  

The balancing mechanism, which penalizes the "leader" and is often criticized, makes for a very tight and close game and is brilliant in my opinion.

Power Grid is a great game with huge replay value and one that I will never turn down.

A excellent game.  I have two big problems with it.  First, it feels like the game moves a bit slowly for the first half.  Second, a player who falls too far behind early might as well be eliminated, but often sticks around as a sort of king-maker waiting to happen.

Make sure you read the tie breaker conditions before your first game.

What a great game. The unofficial theme is "One Electro Short." You know what I mean if you have played the game. I love the turn order manipulation part of the game. It can be tricky to time exactly when to fall back or to leap ahead. This, along with maintaining the efficiency of your power plants, and the constant interaction with others during all the phases, makes this game one of my very top favorites.

RATING: 10
Based on a lot of plays.
+ My favorite Eurogame.
+ Very good theme. It actually makes sense.
+ The endgame is very exciting.
+ Clever mechanics (resource market).
+ Experience is rewarded, but game feels a bit different every time.
+ Very good scalability with different numbers of players.
- This game is NOT for math-haters. One has to do a lot of addition.
- This is not a light game. People who treat this as such, will lose. Always. Requires full concentration.

Update (in 2008, after a half a year): 9-->10. The endgame is still exciting like in no other eurogame!

see comments below for why - I dislike economic games, don't really love auctions, and this one adds on a bunch of tedious arithmetic too.  It's a perfect storm of stuff I don't like in my games.  Unlike a lot of games I've gotten rid of, though, I concede that Power Grid is a [i]very[/i] good design - it's just not for me.
[b]previous comment:[/b]

I've played this more times than BGG would indicate, as I purchased it before I began logging plays, but haven't logged the usual ten plays I prefer before rating a game.

Power Grid - Excel, The Game.  I find this one massively boring.  The decisions are difficult, and the auctions tense, but only because you either slow everyone down by mathing everything out in your head, or try to guess and hope you got it right.  I do like some of the ideas - the catchup mechanisms are good and the way the marketplace of resources works is brilliant, but the actual game play is a too-long snoozefest.  Any game that is improved drastically by using a calculator is not a game I want.  Two or three hours of tedious arithmetic is not my idea of fun.

It's interesting but feels a bit dated. It's dry, very Kathy and can lead to quite a bit of analysis paralysis. I would play again but I don't think I would ever suggest this...indeed I may even suggest alternatives rather than play this again.

The resources market is interesting with the price fluctuating throughout the turn and can lead to interesting decisions about how much to invest, to potentially cause those players further down the pecking order a rather expensive turn, but it is done better and more simply in crude:the oil game.

Power stations are all pretty much of a muchness, basically identical, regardless of the cube type you have to feed it to get power and the auction phase for these is very basic and very straight forward.

However there seemed to be no way to stop a run away leader, once you have more houses, you get more money which lets you buy more houses which gets you more money. Sigh

Board is very busy and gets quite cluttered making it difficult to see the various costs.

Much easier than I was expecting, a nice game. Knowing the types of power stations helps a lot, and not getting ahead in the turn order matters. I recommend this game in spite of it being an auction. ***  Played again despite being comatose, I was only fourth based on cash held at the end. I'm minded to get a copy, if only to learn the power station values/options. I'm convinced switching from 1 to 3 houses powered is a key point, likewise 2 to 5. Upgrading to a 4 house station is just a wasted step. Yup, played it twice and I'm that clever...

My first game may have been skewed by all the good factories coming out early and then ending in phase 2 before we had free reign at the good stuff. The game dragged on a bit while I was expected it to be a bit of a lighter game.

Intricate, fiddly, and baroque, but fun nonetheless.  It always feels like there's a way to break this game, but I have yet to discover it -- my opinion has gone up with repeated plays.  And unlike Age of Steam, it's possible for everyone to "stay in it", but the skilled players still tend to win.

Jogo envolvente, pois coloca o jogador dentro de um ambiente onde o investimento a longo, médio e curto prazo têm a mesma importância, forçando a construção de uma estratégia bem elaborada e concisa.

This game has lots of different elements at work and some fiddly rules, but I am certainly one of those that believe that all of the elements come together in a unified way to create a fantastic game.  The resource market, power plant auctions, and network building all work together well, and failure to properly manage any of these three elements can be devestating.  A great choice if you want to move on from the traditional gateway games.  And I am one of the few that seems to like the art!

Short version: 

Power Grid is a brain-burny, calc heavy, optimization game. I'm willing to play it again, but have serious reservations about the computation necessary for play. 

Longer version:

Power Grid is one of those games that succeeds at what it's trying to do, which is being a brain burner. Unfortunately I didn't find much enjoyment in the process. The whole affair feels overwrought, and the last 30-60 minutes are a journey into computational hell. While I have no problem in doing the math required in my head, I get a feeling that this game could have been a lot stronger if it had been shortened and tightened up. It feels overly muscular, to the point of distraction. The enjoyment of the first 30-60 minutes quickly evaporated as the game went on. The end game is like slogging through mud, with a calculator in one hand, and a pistol with a single bullet in the other. The calculator is used for keeping track of all the fiddly bits, and the pistol is for finishing yourself off when you realize that your chances of winning are slender. While the game we played was a learning game, 4 people and 3 hours, it was apparent to me about 30 minutes before finish that I wouldn't win. While winning isn't the major reason I come to the gaming table, I wish the conclusion had been slightly more ambiguous. When the game finally does end, it does so in a very unsatisfactory manner. There's no sense of accomplishment and the victory conditions seem arbitrary and off center. As far as I'm concerned, the number of cities needed to trigger the end game should be significantly less. Also, available cash should be taken into account in the final reckoning, instead of just as a tie breaker. I'd play this game again, but I wouldn't be very happy about it.

POWER GRID: Played 10+ times with 2,3,5, and 6 players. Replayability seems better than I originally thought. Great economic/route-building game. Power plant theme very well applied. It is a game of calculation and optimizing, but in the best possible way. A good 'fix' of the original Funkenschlag, even if I do miss the crayons. FUNKENSCHLAG 1st ed.: Played 1 time. This game is UGLY, but very nice. Challenging, unique, but easy to learn and play. Don't expect a visual feast, but expect a good game. I think 8 cities is too short and 22 cities is too long. Maybe happy medium of 14? My rating history: 9|8|9|8

Believe the hype: it's that good.  This game feels like a cross between 1830 and Medieval Merchant.  I can't even tell you how many different possibilities you have during your turn.  Careful planning and judicious use of money and ressources is a must.  I lost my first game because I spent too much on garbage.  However, I lost by about 10E, which shows how close everyone is to one another.  Update: after several plays, I see a pattern emerge.  There are two factors which I find will make or break a player's chances: positionning on the board and luck of the draw for the plants during auction.  The first one is something that can be controlled, or should I say policed as everyone needs to be careful not to let one player monopolize the better building spots.  Not all areas are created equal on either the German and the much worse US map.  Even more so if played with fewer than the full 6.

SOOOO much book-keeping which has to be constantly updated in your head, a boring auction system, no theme at all, and takes far too long. Most of the map never gets used unless you're playing with 6 players at which point the game drags for so long. I really hate this game.

RATING: 9
Dynamic gameplay is the crowning jewel of PowerGrid on top of a super-solid and enjoyable set of game mechanics. Every play is influenced by number of players, the order in which power plants show up, location, etc to the point where you never feel like you can completely reuse your strategy from last time. And the juggling of money, resources, and growth is extremely well balanced; there are no situations where you are fighting against a flaw or oversight in the design. The stages of the game also move appropriately quickly.

Additional maps and power plants only make an already great game more compelling.

The instructions and mixup of terms like 'step' and 'phase' in various places are confusing if you're trying to teach yourself, but gameplay itself is actually very straightforward if someone explains the game.

RATING: 10
One of our favorites.  We love the quality of the parts and board.  A family favorite when we can play for an hour or more.  With experienced players, and with 4 or less players, I complete a game in about 50 minutes.  Several techniques can be applied to increase playtime efficiency.  Assign tasks.  Put someone in charge of the power plant market.  Another person should be responsible for the resources market.  Make someone the banker and handle payment of money when powering plants.  I have also found that poker chips speed up the game considerably, once everyone gets the denominations worked out.

I still prefer the USA map, but probably most of all because of general familiarity.  The comments I've read about the huge advantge going to those who start in the East Coast is just inexperience.  I've played about 30 games in-person and over 150 on-line @ BSW.  I've seen many many games won by starting in midwest and western states.  The France map is fun, I love the competition over Paris.

Complaints about the end game I think miss the point of Power Grid.  Of course the last turn, or often the second last turn, decides who wins.  But would you rather have a runaway leader early in the game?  The most enjoyable part of this game is the last few turns and how you need to set yourself up to be in the strongest position in almost every turn you make in the game leading up to that point.  

The most common mistake I see people make is to over-buy power plants.  I tend to minimize how often I purchase plants and spend like crazy when the plants I need become available.  

Another strategy I see misused often is to overbuy resources.  For maybe a dozen games I've seen that strategy impact the winning of the game, but rarely.  Though one of the most memorable winning experiences I had was exactly because of a last minute manuver to starve out the leader because they didn't plan it out well.  If you do not understand the game, end game will mess you up.  If you plan well throughout the game -- purchase what you need, manage your resources and money wisely, the endgame will never surprise you.

The only real issues in the game is that if you don't understand how to win and play against players who do, luck will never help you win.  This truly is a strategy game.  To win the game you have to plan and remain strong through almost the entire game.  Being in first place through most of the game usually does not win, although I've done that and won too.  Winning at Power Grid is a really fine balance of choices you make many times throughout the game.

I think the game is flawless.  It's a deep strategy game with very little luck (order of power plants is it).  Mixing casual gamers with competitive strategy gamers usually doesn't work.  But when players all have a few experienced plays of the game, it's very tight for the entire duration of play, and very much a multiple player strategy game in execution.

Thanks to our 2010 Secret Santa for giving us this! Despite its heavy game reputation, it really isn't that complex or difficult. We've accumulated PG maps irrationally quickly, and here's the order in which I'm interested in playing them (only maps we own so far):

2) Korea
3) Japan
4) Benelux (played once)
5) Italy
6) Central Europe
7) Germany (played once)
8) Spain & Portugal

I've improved even more at the game and understand turn order, managing plant upgrade plans, selecting the right resources while looking at turn order, and when it's okay to be early in turn order.

The power plants and resource prices are still clever. However the game is still a fiddly Frankenstein's monster of rules, and the gameplay too reliant on combinatorial searches combined with arithmetic (the connections) - the very elements I most dislike! Additionally, decision-making is far too sequential, which limits planning ahead (and lengthening the game), and you can get burned on the randomness of the plants coming out.

I recommend Factory Manager as an alternative about balancing different elements and exploiting turn order.

Only one learning game and I can see why people like it, but hard core economic games get old for me.  All values are in the open and I got the feeling that the game would be a real math grind when played hard.  I'm not a mathy type and prefer 'from the gut' play, so I'm sure I'm not a fit with Power Grid.  Played again and had fun. 

The dry theme keeps me from buying it.

RATING: 6
I absolutely love this game, but it's fallen from being my top game because so many games seem to come down to the flip of a power plant somewhere in the midgame.  Still, you can never count anyone out in power grid.  What really makes the game shine is the tension between maintaining the highest capacity in the event of someone building out early, and playing for the highest cities powered past the end game limit. It strikes a good balance between the economic gamers and the lighter gamers in our group.  It's also nice that it plays well from 4-6, or 3-6 with the benelux map.

[Auction, Network Connection, Economic] {6P:5, 5P:7, 4P:7, 3P:6, 2P:5} Recommended by my Geekbuddies (17 ratings, 8.38 average) - [Played both on BSW and F2F; have played with 2,3,4,5 and 6] - Power Grid is an interesting game. It looks great, reading the rules gives one a feeling of substance, and actually playing the game is interesting. However, I felt that it doesn't impart the tension and angst that the *great* gamers' games do. The mechanisms of the game feel unelegant and clunky, like they were cobbled together. The whole player order thing feels a bit "engineered". And this seems to be a game that almost always has a winner determined by the first tiebreaker (cash on hand), simply because the victory condition (cities powered) is something that more than one player can attain with a bit of planning. However, I can't deny that despite all this, the groups I played with were impressed and generally had fun. For me, it was OK, a pretty good game that I would play any time, but it's definitely not a top-tier offering in the class of Puerto Rico, Princes of Florence and Euphrat & Tigris. (On rereading - how can comments on a good game sound so negative? Oh well, maybe it was the high expectations. Not a huge favorite, but extremely versatile and replayable, especially when the expansion maps are released.) *** UPDATE: Power Grid has been getting heavy F2F play, and while it's become a favorite of some of my gaming group, it's slipped just a bit more in my eyes. After people grasped the concepts of the game, we've been falling into the dreaded "Step 2 Stall" where no one wants to connect 7 until plant capacity is near or at 17, and where the best thing to do is nothing. You can tell that several turns of doing nothing but firing existing plants makes for a really boring midgame while players wait for the "permanent" (capacity 5 & 6) plants to appear in the market. You go through the drudgery of crappy plants cycling away and no connections for several turns while players stockpile cash. Sound strategy, but freaking boring. Down to a 7.

I'm not as enamoured with this  game as many others, but I'm not exactly sure why.  There's a lot of math involved, and can be subject to some severe analysis paralysis.  The game can be strongly influenced by what order the power plant cards come up for auction.  There are times where a lucky draw near the end of an auction round can produce a huge unexpected advantage to one player, which is a little more luck than I would like for this type of a long game.  But overall, I still enjoy it and see it as a solid game.

RATING: 8
The game has, IMNSHO, changed for the better with the introduction of the new board and new rules.  The cumbersome element of drawing your powerlines has been removed and a much tighter, strategic game results from the new connection system.

Of course, when I say "better" this doesn't mean the old one is not an excellent game - on the contrary it is.  Besides this, the crayon element will always appeal more to some.

UPDATE 20DEC07:  After playing last night I am starting to become a little less enamoured by the game.  For what must be the fourth time in about a dozen games I have watched helplessly as somebody else has been handed the game.  This is a disappointing aspect, but not enough yet for me to lower it to a 7.  If I find the game continues to be prone to this situation then I might have to lower the rating.  Having said that, this is probably down to inexperienced play.

I suppose the accountancy stuff is boring, but the two times I've played this were with a big group at a bar. AP was frowned upon and both plays were excellent. Tons to consider and awesome market mechanics. I should probably account for my beer colored glasses in the score, so I'll let this sit at an 8 until I've had a few more chances to play.

Recently had a chance to revisit this and it's definitely a solid 8 for me. Easy to teach, flows very nicely.

RATING: 5
I really don't get the hype.  I've played a few times with a variety of numbers of players, and none of those has been fun.  The problem for me: the game really has no flow, and no payoff.  Each turn has basically 3 jerky steps: auction, resource purchase, get income.  And when endgame happens, there is no sense of satisfaction.  I usually win, but for some reason there is no feeling of accomplishment in doing so.  Maybe it's the theme, maybe it's the endless tiny bits, maybe it's the work you have to go through each turn (how many coal get replenished on THIS map with FOUR people during phase TWO??).  It seems to have an unneccesary amount of bulk (in bits AND rules) for little return.  I probably won't even buy this one just to have in the collection.  Maybe if I find it at a garage sale for 50 cents.... There's better stuff out there; I have NO IDEA how this monster is so high on BGG.

(I was glancing at some of the other reviews and noticed somewhat referred to theme of the game as "depressing".  I couldn't put my finger on it until then!  That was perfect!  I thought it was just somewhat unsatisfying, but now that I think about it, that's not the whole story.  As I play it and build stuff and collect garbage to power it I actually DO get depressed.  We joke about the brownouts when we don't have enough power for our cities, or that we have posh residents with high-end power demands when we have an abundance.  But those jokes are always tinged with bitterness.  Maybe I'm taking this game too seriously...)

Very fiddly game. By consulting the appropriate chart, we see that if there are 4 players, coal is replenished at a rate of 5 units per round, then at 6, then at 4. With 5 players it's 5-7-5, with 6 it's 7-9-6. I keep waiting for someone to say, "Except on Tuesday!" Meanwhile, power plants disappear from the market at the rate of one per round, but then there's a kind of leap day at the end of step 1 where you discard another one... just to make everything work out right. Aaaaack! Much more fun than it has any right to be.

One of the best management game I've played. Extremely well balanced with a number of different and difficult choices to make throughout the game. Impressive design, very different from other games I've played by this author. Definitly not as good as a 2 player game.

A good game but not one I'd play if I had a choice of something higher up the list. Some good mechanism but not very engaging and devolves into uncontrollable bouts of addition. Not something I'm willing to play when I'm tired. It's also starting to show its age.

After one game I don't understand what all the fuss is about. If I wanted to scrutinize over how to save tiny amounts of money I would just go to the store... as that is what my real life is like. I felt like there was no way to pull ahead of the pack. Almost as if I played willy-nilly I would still only be 2 or 3 points back of the leader.

RATING: 8
It's relatively hardcore, one of the heavier board games I'd be interested in owning. But it's sooo pretty. I love the art in this game all around, and I think it's a really fun and interesting game. Not especially elegant, and the many expansion boards make it even less so, but in this case it's part of the charm. Memorizing the rules is a challenge, and I'm still not confident teaching it to total newbies, but my current enthusiasm for it is surely enough to overcome that.

RATING: 6
Route-building game with interesting elements like an auction round and a fluctuating resource market. Rules can be bit fiddly.

The player order system means that Power Grid is an economic snowball game in which do not really want to be first until right before the game ends, and much depends on timing. Somehow feels oddly limiting to me.

Update: I realize I'm less impressed with each additional play. The power plant auction is the single most important phase of the game, closely followed by player order considerations that get more urgent as the end of the game approaches. Considering how little game time those two things actually take it is rather obvious that the game carries a lot of uninspired excess baggage around with it. Downgrading from 7 to 6.

What an excellent game. Deceptively simple - the whole game, after all, is just buying things - but the way those three different classes of thing interlink, the way you have to time things, the way you have to know when to hold back and when to rush forward... the art is charming, the different maps FEEL different without being finicky rules-chaff, the game has a sense of slow, building progression AND an all-out exciting climax when everything you do matters and everything is on a knife-edge. One of only two games that makes me head hurt with the stress of playing it (the other is Haggis)... but it's the good kind of stress. So exhilarating.

Power Grid is the kind of game that I've found myself drawn to more and more over the past three years -- economic auction games with simple rules and some nice tension. I enjoy the bit of randomness in the power plant deck, though it has bitten me more than once. The best for of PG for me is the bevy of expansion options currently available. For my money, I'm betting that The Robots and The Stock Companies are great fun.

Economic game of building power plants, electrical networks via a variety of power sources.   Excellent auction mechanisms and I enjoy the resources market and network building.

Played it only a few times, but enjoyed it a lot. The demand and supply behaviour of the prices of the materials is a pretty cool. The game has a very low luck factor and it's a real brain-burner. Nonetheless I think it is a bit overbalanced. Although some players usually follow worse strategies then the others, point-wise all our games end up very tight. But this is just a minor complaint, altogether I find Power Grid to be a very well designed game.

A clever combination of an auction game and a resource gathering/area control game.  I really like the theme and I think the gameplay is well thought out and refined.  It is a bit mathy.

Lots of direct player interaction which really works and makes the game interesting to play.  Quite a bit of replayability.

Arrived in mail, 5/26/04. After 7 plays... This is an excellent game. However, it is still playing a bit long for us. It took 5 newbies nearly 3 hours to complete our first game. Our 6th playing took 3 hours including explanation (two newbies and three who had played it. It is about the same weight as Age of Steam (certainly not the same game). All who have played have enjoyed it, but it doesn't make it out as often as shorter games on our game night since we only have a few hours to play. However, it is undoubtedly one of the better games in my collection. I also have the France/Italy board, but have only played once (France), with 4 plays on the German board, and 2 on the USA board.

Power Grid is a very strong economic game.  You really do feel like you're building a network of power lines, with real power plants running the show.  The auction phase is exciting; the resource buying and upkeep feels completely natural; the connecting to cities has a nice Euro blockage feel; the balancing and turn order mechanics are perfect.  Apart from the constant mathwork, stages/rounds/phases confusion and some last-player catch-up issues, Power Grid is an awesome game and worthy of any game-shelf.

Great game! You have to pace yourself since it has a very clever catch up mechanic. So if you're first all the time you might get only very expensive fuel or you might get blocked by other players cities.

It's got it all - supply and demand, increasing resource scarcity, cool bidding mechanic (I especially like the "future market"), cost/benefit calculations, and several ways to screw your opponents. Plus it is very thematic - different kinds of power plants, real-world map, etc. One of the rare games that I don't think will ever "get old" for me.

Tense auctions, sacrificing income to switch turn orders in able to benefit later.  This game is brilliant, and the art is wonderful.  This one brings out the white knuckles and competetive nature in every one.

update: this one suffers from the sameyness feeling.  The engine is sound, but each ride feels like another.  The randomness in the cards is deceptive, it doesn't make Power Grid feel like a game built on chance but if the timing isn't in your favor then too bad.  this is often countered by a stalling in the game that can drag.  The late game mathematics also can slow this to a halt.  8 to 7.

Update:  The computations involved in Power Grid aren't complex but they are constant.  The overtly mathematical nature of this game is a distraction for me, as it really punishes players that are more intuitive in their gaming style or like a steady flow.  I find Power Grid offers too little reward for the investment made in both time and thought.  It still is a strong design, it just is becoming less the style of game I choose to play.  Maybe supplying each player with a calculator would aid in my opinion.

RATING: 8
I haven't given this enough plays to make a definitive pronouncement, but I've really enjoyed it so far.  People griping about "no meaningful decisions" puzzle me. I usually have plenty of variables to crunch through during my down time, most of them involving my opponents as well as my own state: plant placement, resource availability/hoarding, auction market, phase timing, etc. Not a lot of it spans beyond the next turn, but I don't really see that as a detraction (my brain can only retain so much at a time). The opportunism in this game is one of its most intriguing aspects. It feels satisfying and fun to my family but I guess it comes down to how much... arithmetic & opportunism you can tolerate.

[BGCOLOR=#00cc00][b][COLOR=#00cc00].[/COLOR]10[COLOR=#00cc00]![/COLOR][/b][/BGCOLOR][b]:[/b] Outstanding game. One of my all-time personal favorites.

Father's Day gift '07, and still one of my favorites.  Won my first game with more than two - great success!

I'm still pretty bad at this, but always enjoy playing even when I know I made a fatal error.

I feel so benificent when playing this, providing power to poor souls who don't have light before I arrive in town.

Ok, maybe not, but this is an auction game perfectly melded to the board and resources.  Much better for the shorter time and reduced fiddliness when compared to its predecessor Funkenschlag.

Seems enjoyable and fun with a great theme. The first 2 games did seem to run long which turned off my gamer group who were expecting a shorter play time. The cut throat auction mechanic could cause concern for some players.

Great game where you are constantly making decisions that might seem not so relevant at first but will have tremendous consequences in the future. Has a bit of the Age of Steam feeling to it, but is less fiddly. About as much luck as in Puerto Rico, which means very little. Very little down time which is usually spent burning your brain away. Has auctions, but they rarely get intensive.

This is more of a speculative rating, based on only a single playing... It seems like an interesting set of mechanisms, but the game's ending really seemed to sneak up on me (and on my opponents).  Presumably with more play, the timing of the game end becomes more obvious.

Played the PC version.
I'd love to love it. You know - I'm a geek and I love this game, don't bother these awful graphics on the map, being a calculator is FUN... .
It's too mathy, not in the way that you need to add some numbers, mathy because of all these fiddly tables with income etc.
I love the art and hate it at the same time.
And I can't find myself having fun trying to optimise my route, although I do understand people that do.

Power Grid is incredible.  It balances on the edge of 'too complex' and 'too simple' masterfully.  The game length is great.  It isn't too hard to explain to newcomers, though some of the esoteric rules can be overwhelming at first.  The theme fits the gameply perfectly, and the progression of the game's economy is a wonder of design.  Bravo.

Much better than Puerto Rico IMO.

I thought it was too long for the payoff.  The turns became repetitive. I wondered why the more experienced players stayed a city or two behind and stockpiled fuel until in Phase 2 and 3 when they made a spasm of connections to jump ahead. Next time I'll try the same. It then becomes a mathematical optimization problem.

What I don't like about this game is that the way it's balanced together with the stress that is put on the last round makes me feel that all I do before the last round doesn't really matter  much. Too much importance is put on the last turn in comparison to the rest of the game.

PG is balanced in a way that makes the finish always a very close one but at the same time rather anticlimactic. 

Also the game seems TOO RANDOM for a heavy 2h game because of the way the power plants show up on the market. 

In the end it feels like chance is too big a factor in determining the winner.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.9
After a few plays, I have come to view this game as fun, but certianly not the best auction game around.  While it will play 6 player, I now feel that not everyone has the ability to win.  Generally there are only 2 of 6 players who actually have a shot of winning and everyone else just seems to come up short.

RATING: 9
I don't know why people think this is a heavy game. 
It's really not. This game should be at the level of success as monopoly. They should use this to teach kids math. That's how good I think Power Grid is. I'm horrible at math and this has helped my arithmetic immensely. But that aside, Power Grid has great mechanics, simple, elegant design. Perfect game.

A true classic in all respects. It accommodates 2 to 6 players very well (although with 2 the Robots expansion is recommended) and offers a lot of different game mechanics in about 2 hours time: auction/bidding, money management, resource management, network building. It's tense, it's fun, it features unique theme and artwork and has a lot of replayability, with or without the plethora of available expansions.
As for the components, to me the little wooden houses and paper money are a clever and revealing choice: this is truly the 21th Century equivalent of Monopoly!

EDIT: As of now (June 2013) I own every official expansion and promo cards ever released for the game and it's probably the crown jewel of my board game collection!

Introducted to this game by a good friend, and I can clearly see why it is rated within the top 10.  Excellent balance with a neat theme, really nice playing pieces and lots of replay value, not to mention expansions available if you want them.  As a precaution to those math challenged: there is a reasonable amount of counting in this game.  I recommend not bothering with the clunky paper money and just using a pencil, paper and perhaps a calculator on this one.  Good times though!

RATING: 7
This isn't a bad game but not great either.  The plant auction is good if all players are skilled. Have played with 3 & 4 players.  The end game comes very sudden most times. Easy game to learn. Need to be good at math though or have a calculator for optimum game winability. Have China/ Korea expansions. Korea board is a nice variant with two stock markets.  Definite 2 hour game. 

Forgot to mention. Use poker chips for currency instead of paper. Much much better:)

Very good game with a lot of different mechanics and things to consider. It feels like playing 3 games in 1 where you have an auction phase, a market phase, and an area control phase.

Playing Power Grid after RotW felt dry and empty.

RATING: 9
Power grid plays out in a number of very logical phases (buy power plants, buy resources, build the grid, power cities).  Somehow, these pieces all come together to form something greater than the sum of the parts.  While it begins as a straightforward game of optimizing an economy, in the final third of the game Power Grid evolves into a riveting contest of psychology, timing, and aggressive bidding.  

It can tend to play a little long, especially for groups who suffer from AP.

This has gone over surprisingly well with inexperienced board gamers.  The concepts are pretty easy to pick up.

This was a great game, lots of mechanics to keep people competative, lots of interaction.  You do need help keeping the board updated, you should have one person restock supplies, one for money, one for rankings, and another run the power plants for the smoothest play.  But that's just nitpicking this was a very good game with great strategy, some luck to keep it different and solid mechanics.

I've only played the game twice and I've got to concur with someone who described this game as "relentless number crunching."  Which is OK, I teach math on the high school level, but 3 hours is way too long (based on a five player game...I shudder to think what a 6 player would be like.)  I don't like the positional screwage aspect of the game where you can get elbowed out of the game fairly early, and in a long game that is unforgivable.  Tight money management is too complex; Saint Petersburg does this ever so much better.

10 years later - A 3rd play confirms my original take on this game.  I could get roped into playing Power Grid again; it's not outside the realm of possibility.  But it would be such a waste of good gaming time.

In other words, I like the continually changing pricing system.  Very nice.  I don't like the look of the board much, not that it matters much to practial me.

Initial rating after one play.

There is a beautifully designed, dynamic market engine running the game. However, optimization games where you basically run the same thing through the game more and more and more efficiently, tend not to be my thing and same seems to apply to Power Grid too. I don't mind playing it, but the kind of decisions it requires don't hold any particular interest to me.

I can't really say why I like Power Grid as much as I do, as the game tends to be incredibly mathy, and I'm sometimes borderline discalculic.

Based on my first few plays - I really like this game.

Three plays so far, and I am still just starting to understand the balance between making sure I'm not first in order, but also not letting others get ahead in cities and production.  Even my girlfriend is really getting into this one.  Great stuff.

There is a pretty harsh learning curve, especially in terms of knowing what to bid on power plants.  Smart substation placement also takes some experience.  Still, we're really getting into it.

This is a classic for a good reason. The auction mechanic works great, as well as the supply/demand for available resources. This game is much simpler to play than it appears/reads. However, I see the similarity to Monopoly, it seems like there are slightly cheaper specific routes to build on the map, and if you're quick, you profit off of snagging up that territory. I like it, but I think I like Airlines Europe a bit more. (And it plays quite similarly.)

Played once, but liked it enough to know I wanted it. Theme matches game play, and the almost-proletarian art fits well. Some call the art dry, but should it be flashy with a theme like running a power plant? Now, the downside? It's mathy like people say. It's also a little hard to take all of the rules in on first play. Nonetheless, I ran out and bought it. Now if only I felt like taking out such a relatively heavy game now and then.

RATING: 9
Lots of strategy to this game, my favorite 'heavier' game thus far, plays best with about 4, may run a bit long for some as well as a lot of additional downtime with more players, still trying to figure out many of the nuances to this game, but look forward to playing it more in the future (if I can find people willing!).

Edit:
Was my favorite game until introduced to RFTG, and due to the fact that it has seen very little play time. If it could be shortened this game would easily be a 10 based on personal preferences (I prefer short to medium length but intricate games). Still fun everytime I play, but finding the right people to play is a problem.

One of the better 'long' games. Ours typically run 3-4 hours An excellent game of resource management, auctions, and track (power-line) building - plays very well with 3. I printed my own super-size map which is mounted in a large frame.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Pros:
* The design is very cool and retro. To me it's a great looking game.
* The energy market, simulating supply and demand, is a super idea.
* Fierce auctions where bluffing and manipulation are big components
* Managing your economy and setting aside just enough for three different areas of spending is tricky - in a very good way.

Cons:
* Refilling of energy market is way too generous. Needs tweaking.
* Lame and dull auctions if the players don't realize the importance.
* I feel that you get too much money, or maybe things are too cheap.
* Rich-get-richer, runaway leader problems.
* Player interaction is a bit too limited
* The maps have areas that in my mind are clearly better than others
* Step 3 is usually very short if it exists at all. Not a big problem, it just feels a bit weird.


Gameplay with 
2 Players: Only good as a learning experience. Would never play again
3 Players: Too easy, not enough contention. Everyone can be part of every city - which I feel is just too nice.
4 Players: This works very well. But if you feel (like I do) that there is not enough tension in the game, adjust the energy market to refill as per the 3 player rules. This makes things much more enjoyable. Solves or lessens much of the problems I have with the game. 
5 Players: Not tried yet
6 Players: This also worked well, but not quite as good as the 4 player game. Auctions are a bit more interesting but also takes a lot more time. I was surprised that the map felt so roomy even with one area off limits (6 players, 5 areas). Energy market refill rate is seriously off in this case. Even when refilling as if we were five players instead of six, it still felt way too generous.


The economy management is nice and you're always worried that the extra electro you had to spend on the shiny new power plant will actually prevent you from buying enough resources, or expanding into the economically attractive area you had your eye on.
Player interaction is limited to the power plant auction (jacking up the price of the plant you think your opponents need the most, and manipulating/bluffing them into taking plants you're not interested in), driving up the prices on resources (not always an option because there is a limit to what and how much you can buy), completely depleting a resource (thus driving your opponents out of that market), and expanding into your opponents areas (to make it more expensive for them to expand). I don't know if those methods aren't effective enough or if my group simply aren't using them enough. But in all of our games, the "leader" (player with the most cities) on the second turn has won the game. Adjusting the energy market has made the games closer, tougher and much more fun, but it is still not a big hit with me.

RATING: 7.5
It's quite difficult for me to rate this game.

On one hand simply awesome mechanics - everything works just perfectly.

On the other hand - the game is quite dry (buy power plants, buy resources, buy stations, sell - earn money and so on) and mathy (constant counting). It's hard (at least for me) to evaluate how other players are performing and what should I do to stop them from winning. I also can't calculate how many stations they can buy (in fact at the end of a game it's hard to calculate how many stations I will be able to buy), so I bid for power plants and buy resources tentatively. Because of that the final result is quite unpredictable and you can sometimes lose by a few Elektro because you bid to much. 
To sum up, during the game I'm having fun, although I don't feel I can control the game. When the game ends I usually feel some frustration.

Overall rating: 7,5/10. Hadn't it been the brilliant mechanics it would be only 6/10.

Its rules are easy to learn but it is not as easy to master it. Many different options, strategies and tactics. Almost all the games are really close till the end of the session, adding a lot of tension to the game. Nice auctions, good mechanics for the reposition of the materials and a lot of interaction in the laying of the electrical substations. I love it: fantastic euro that plays very well with four to six players. Only problem: keep it away from AP players because at the end of the game they can dramatically drag it out. Expansions maps add replayability but are not a must have since the core game is enough to keep you busy for a long time (it has a double sided USA and Germany map. I only own the china/corea exp map).

Power Grid is by far the best game around.  It is fun, short (less than two hours to play), strategic, uses a small amount of probability, encourages interaction, encourages a smidgeon of bluff, is well-balanced, and, oh yes, fun (did I mention fun?).  Power Grid and all the expansion maps (thank you to those avid fans who keep posting new maps on Board Game Geek -- keep up the good work) give the brain a workout and they're fun.  Did I mention that Power Grid is fun?  Anyone for a game?

A monster of a game! Though after a few turns, things get naturally in place, and rules are tweaked in such a way (turn order, resource market...) that it's difficult to run away with the lead, or to get too far back... Still, every move counts and helps you set up the end game, which is usually fairly tense. -- I've been surprised once, when after a few boring turns with everybody at 6-7 cities, a player suddendly got victory by building 8 cities at once and powering 8 cities while all the other players could only power 7 or less. D'oh! Won't happen again, grumble grumble.

I keep thinking this is an intro game for non-euro gamers.
It is not.

I love the auction.  I love competing for real estate.

I wish this game was 90 minutes, and it feels like it should be, but it just isn't, unless everyone is on their game.  I feel like I need to keep things moving when we play.  A lot of - "okay, now your turn to build...."

I don't think I've ever played this game where all the people playing loved games, but I could see it as an exceptional game in that context.  Until then, it remains at an 8.  It's a game I can't seem myself ever getting rid of as long.

All right, I'll be providing a dissenting view of this one. First off; it's rated very highly, and man do people rave about it, hence why I wanted to get a copy so badly. So, I tried it with my Lady several times (and likely it's better with more) and I couldn't help but think, "This is BORING as all hell!" It's just not my type of game.

I don't particularly like brain-burning euros. This is an exercise in mathematics almost every turn (which I had enough of in high school), and building powerplants? *yawn* Next!

Rewards multiple strategies, adapting to an ever-changing market of power plants and resources, and demands that players think ahead to win. Great introduction to Euro-style games. Game works best with 3 or more players. A little more challenging to teach to newcomers, but certainly not impossible.

Fantastic game that rewards multiple strategies and adapting to change. Downsides are that the mechanics don't work as well with 2 players and certain areas of the board a very unbalanced, making startup costs for one player much more expensive unnecessarily.

Great economic style game with very original theme and nice network building mechanic.

Pros:
+ Very original theme,
+ Much of calculations in game, which forces people to use smooth mathematical skills (useful in real life too),
+ The game is long enough to keep decisions strategic.

Cons:
- The game end becomes quite suddenly and the players often have no time to prepare for it,
- The winner in many cases can be the most successful player particularly at the last round,
- The move order is quite fixed and motivates to be last, not lead while playing.

A remarkably simple game once you understand the mechanics.  It's still a challenge to manage your money.  When, oh when do you buy that new plant to replace your old ones..?  This is an improvement over the original, Funkenschlag.  Better components, and a much quicker gameplay since they removed the (superfluous, imho) route drawing mechanic.  Use poker chips rather than the paper money to further streamline the playing time.

In terms of mechanics this is one of the best euros I've played. However, I didn't enjoy it very much because there is too much calculating for me to enjoy it.

I prefer Power Grid to the 1st edition Funkenschlag because (1) the shorter length is nice, (2) it's less prone to long stagnant periods, and most importantly, (3) the pre-drawn routes eliminate the biggest headache (and waste of time) from the 1st edition.  However, the streamlining comes with a price attached.  In the original Funkenschlag there was more time and space for interesting maneuvering in the middle and late stages of the game: manipulating the turn order at just the right time, choosing how to pace yourself and when to pounce, looking for good intermediate-level power plants before you had to turn your attention to your game-winning plants.  Some of the subtlety and strategic breadth is lost in Power Grid.  Players have to start building their game-winning plants very early in the game, exacerbating the luck of the draw associated with the ordering of the power plants within the deck.   See my Spiel des Josh 2004 GeekList for more detailed thoughts.

This game is very balanced - almost too balanced. Its hard to really fall behind. I think it is better to be in the lead even though you get last choice at everything than to hang back in order to get first choice, because you probably won't get that late boost you would need in order to win.

Playing the China/Korea board with the new card deck made this fun for me again. The power plants were agonizingly limited so one wrong choice and you were done for. I don't know if that was a variant or had to do with the new deck or what but it was great.

First impressions: The game is a lot of fun, I love the mechanics and the need to think a few turns ahead. I am always planning for early, mid and late game straegy in all games so its neat to see my moves contently messing up with those who didn't plan ahead! I won the first game by a large margin but everyone is interested to play again, just hard because this is my favorite euro BUT who has time for those when there are wargames to be played! Will have to wait for people that enjoy modern euros and introduce them to this! Excited to try again - initial rating is low because it is being compared to my collection!

RATING: 9
It impresses me how much game you can fit in relatively few mechanics. It’s simple, but not simplistic. It’s tense, but not because of lack of strategy, but because there can be very close a near failure and total victory. If I’m going to teach a good and a little meatier euro, this would probably be it.

I think it plays well with the number of players I have played with, which is four, five and six. It is tense with any number, but I probably like it better with the lower number of players as it seems to be less chaotic (especially in the auctions). Two maps are supplied in the game and I have played them both. Of those I think I prefer the German side over USA.

I think I've had this game on this list for over 12 months now and last night I finally got a chance to play it and it did not disappoint! I really enjoy the interconnected nature of the auctions, your money, the connections between cities and the cost of cities. Someone in my group compared this game to Hansa Teutonica and I can see that comparison, but I like the greater simplicity of Power Grid more. Not having any experience with the game, it was hard to factor in what to pay for the various plants early in the game and I didn't realize how important it was to get in the way of some of your opponents to prevent them from building cities super cheaply early in the game (especially in the Northeast corner of the U.S. map), but overall this is a system I want to explore more and a game that could easily find its way into my collection at some point.

RATING: 7
Played eight times, four times with four, twice with five and twice with six. I like the game, though it does have its rough edges; it scores big on theme and graphic design, but it's unforgiving and a bit labor-intensive for my taste. Also, games where one finds one's self in a position where the only sensible move is to stall are a pet peeve of mine. Some people feel like too much of the game boils down to how the plant cards show up, and I can see how that might be true.

I'm never going to play with six players again; the game just goes on way, way too long. 

Another thought: I really like having a calculator handy when playing this one.

RATING: 7.5
A game that I admire, more than enjoy. The escalation mechanics that gradually make power plants obsolete even as new parts of the grid open up for competition are very clever. The game is essentially about solving an equation each turn, and I think the absence of a random factor or hidden information hurts the endgame a bit (in terms of excitement), but this is a satisfying game, where the players are almost always engaged, and it moves right along. Let down by a deterministic and number-crunching endgame that practically demands mini-maxing.

I really like this game a lot.  Every time I play it just makes me want to play it again to try a new strategy.  I like that there are multiple facets to success.  Your power plants, your resources, and your network.  The game does take time to play (I seem to average around 3 hrs with beginners), but I think that comes down if playing with more experienced players.  In addition I rarely feel that there's downtime as I've got to plan my finances, what I want to buy vs. what I need to buy.  A wonderful game.

2005 acquisition.

Current rating is for one single 4-player game.

Many thanks to Andrew, finally managed to play my first game during the evening gaming session in AGE 2009.  It was a 4-player game and it left a very good first impression.  Many difficult decisions regarding when and where to build power plants, which power plant to bid for and how much, when to hold back when to strive to go ahead or keep pace with the fellow players.

Rating for new Edition. Decent game but artwork is still not state of the art. As for the mechanics there are other "multi-option" games which create more tension. I found this a bit too "linear" (predictable), not very demanding in strategy, only calculating cheapest way. I wish it was deeper and less "solved". Furthermore too depending on randomness when are which power plants available for auction. OK as a gateway game but no reason to play it more than a couple of times.

This is an awesome game.  It involves all facets of board game strategy in 1 game (auction, supply/demand, market forces, money management, worker placement).  Huge interaction with other players, the game is impossible to have the same experience each time due to the differing power plants, so no repeat experiences.  The best game I've played so far.

Played 20+  2,3,4,5&6 player. The way the costs of the raw materials is determined is a wonderful working model for how price fluctuates with supply & demand.

*UPDATE* Just clipped off some minor negative comment I made on this game. Time allowing, this is the game I most desire to play when with gamers. Nuff said. 2005

*UPDATE* 2 Years on and this is still getting lots of play, the new maps keep it varied. It has deserved its ellevated to a "10" Feb 07

*UPDATE* If this was really a 10 I'd have pushed more to get it played and it's been a few years now so I'll retire it to a 9. August 2013

*UPDATE* What was I thinking. My 35th game and I'm back in love with Power Grid. The new maps keep it fresh. September 2014

I really like this game.  I like the "bits", the cards and the fact that there is expansion boards.  

I like the money aspect and the bidding aspect as it can really level out the game between players.  

This game has a lot of good strategy and doesn't leave a bad vibe between players in the game.  Not that I am a touchy feely player or anything like that but I don't like games that can have one player announcing after 1 turn that the game is over.   Axis and Allies is the classic game where you roll bad on the first round...its game over.  And a game that takes 30 minutes to setup and 5 minutes of play and 10 minutes to take down ....in my opinion is not a good game....oh wait I should be giving my evaluation of Power Grid here.  

[In a caveman voice]...Power Grid Good!!

RATING: 8
Gameplay feels very smooth and polished. The basics of the game are pretty simple, enough that this is what I'll use to introduce new players into heavy games. The sheer depth of calculation that can be put into every choice is staggering: a distinct math-y, think-y kind of game. Interesting leader control dynamic trying to balance your own expansion with allowing your opponent more opportunities.

Only big issue I've had with this game is the time commitment, but the end tends to still have everyone as riveted to the game as the start. The wording in the game bugs me a bit as well, "phases" and "steps" always end up backwards in my head intuitively. A bit bland too, but the generic theme helps with its position as a starting point for heavier games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.2
All games are tight games. After a few play it's clear how one of the best strategies is just to wait and play last, amassing Elektros and build 7-8 cabins at the same time. We use a house rule setting the limit of cabin one can build in a turn to 4-5. Kingmaking can be a problem too.

Enjoyed playing the game but it took a LONG time to play. The rulebook is great, the economics of the game were a pleasure to work with, but the USA map we played was a nuisance. I'm sure other maps offer a different experience, but the map doesn't really become an asset at any point. You can get locked in very easily (hello, west coast). It also bothered me that players don't pay anything to the people who have plower plants in the city. Maybe I've played too much Caylus...I'm sure the designers already tried this and decided against it. Too bad. The map therefore became an obstacle and a bit of a nuisance.

An excellent game with just about everything I want in a game: a lot of ways to win, a lot of interaction, and a lot of fun.

I won't argue against this being a great game. I just don't enjoy playing it very much. 

The mechanics and theme are fantastic, and the rounds are broken up in a way that keeps you nearly constantly engaged. I just find that every time I play I find myself wishing that it had ended about 45 minutes sooner. I'm always burned out for the last few rounds. And that's a problem because the last few rounds are where the game is won or lost. Money and space is so tight at that point that you really need to plan out your moves down to the dollar. I don't have the energy at that point, and I'm not in the mood for waiting while people with more energy spend 10 minutes doing math in their head to make the optimal play.

Just got this, along with the France/Italy expansion. Have played a few full games already, which were superb, so I believe this is going to be one of my top rated games ever.

What I like about Power Grid is the balancing act that you have to do... there are effectively 4 commodities that must be balanced. Firstly Money; Secondly Power Plants and power generation; Thirdly Fuel Resources... required to run the Power Stations and Fourthly network size... Money is required to obtain the other 3, which then combine to generate money again and so on. There's plenty of maths required to play Power Grid, as well as a bit of a head for business.. and there's a very clever and slightly volatile decision tree too. Although I haven't played the game very much yet, I am just so excited by it and I can tell it's going to be one of my highest rated games.

Great economic growth game.  The only drawbacks are that strategies are seldom affected as much as they should be by all but the newest map expansions, and the fairly rigid strategy involved.  More of an game of measuring cost-benefit and efficiency than thinking outside of the box, and very little sense of the thrill of risk.  I'm always engaged, but rarely surprised by any action.  I always feel like I'm in control of my fate, but don't feel much tension until the later parts of the game.  Good elements of timing, but I find Imperial to be more complex in this regard.

best euro game I have played, although Automobile and Formula D/De are in the running.

includes France/Italy, Benelux/Central Europe, China/Korea, Brazil/Spain & Portugal and Russia/Japan, new power plant cards, and robots.

Maps:

Germany:  always a good choice
United States:  average, high connection costs
Benelux:  fast play due to plant discard
Spain & Portugal:  a pointless nuke rule
India:  resource bidding rule is glacial and the blackout special rule is pointless.
Russia:  great map, resource and plant constraints make it a cut-throat experience.

New power plants:

I do not like the new power plant cards - they are too efficient and the game is less interesting without the resources being constrained.

Robots:

robot play #1; single player with 3 robots in France.
human:  19 cities, 16 power, $138 cash
robot #1:  3 cities, 6 power, $66 cash
robot #2:  10 cities, 10 power, $205 cash
robot #3:  12 cities, 11 power, $183 cash

a single player can place all the robots right next to each other, so that probably needs some rules help.  robot #1 stalled due to bidding up to +10 on power plants and buying all resources; he was cash starved.  robot #2 was slow due to 'buys the first choice' allowed the player to manipulate him into low power and 'only supplied cities' then kept his cities low.  robot #3 was limited to 1 city in phase I and 2 cities in phase II, keeping him from keeping pace with the player, who completed the game just as phase III started.

all-in-all, I think the robots should be good for 2-3 players, while just adequate for solitaire.

Played this once with a friend and his wife and had to buy it.  I'm looking forward to more plays.  It's like Ticket to Ride meets...um...something.  Can't remember what.  I do like games like this though.  

This game has had several plays and I enjoy it each time.  Can't wait to get the deluxe version

the only real issue i have with this game is the amount of time it takes to teach and play. I was told in advance that there would be a hour rules and over an hour of play. I enjoyed the whole process of this game so for me ill jump in but I always hesitate to introduce new people to it just because of the time you burn to get it started and then to finish it is at least the same.

RATING: 6
Interesting mix of genres: It's at the same time a connection, economic and auction game. It works, but maybe too much effort was put into assuring everyone is in the game until the end. The catch-up mechanic, based on turn order, is just too strong. Although in my only play I did manage to stay in the lead most of the time and win, I felt I was much more punished than rewarded for that. If I hadn't won when I did, I'd likely have lost the game in the next round - to any of three other players. Holding back seems to be a very good strategy. Another problem is that whenever a power plant is bought in an auction, a new random one is drawn, meaning a lucky player can get a much better plant for its minimum cost.

I enjoy the idea of this game, but playing it tends to be a somewhat different experience.  I'm not sure how much I like the 'punish the leader' mechanic.  Additionally, luck of the draw on power plants, the endgame mechanics and the inequities of start positions on the board combine to leave me lukewarm.

This one has grown on me a bit and I'm starting to appreciate some other elements of the game.  I still think the luck of how the powerplants come out is the make or break element of this game.

We were all new to this game and had to work it out together, but I don't think this is the reason I didn't immensely enjoy this game. 

It just feels like a game that you play with a serious mindset, which once in a while is ok (and I would certainly play again), but I generally prefer more fun to my games.

Power Grid is great.  It's balanced and great with three people.  The game offers so many options in terms of strategy that it never feels old.  The one problem is that the end game tends to drag if a bunch of cheap plants end up on the bottom of the deck.

Favorite game of all time! This game just sucked me in from the first time I played it. I am really not even that good at it, but it is absolute genious. It is a medium to heavy weight euro-styled economic game. Very little luck with amazing board play. If you don't like mathy decisions, it may be difficult for you, but it's really simple equations on what the optimal move is to get where you want to get by paying the least. The game is different every time you play it because you do not use the same board spaces in every game and the players really dictate how the bidding will work. Also, there is plenty of player interaction in most every aspect of this game.  The catch up mechanic is genius so that those who have never played before, will still have a chance, but when you are playing with experienced gamers, they use the catch up mechanic to their advantage. There are many maps and promos to expand your experience and the artwork is phenomenal. This game is a great game for those people who loved monopoly when they were on the "dark-side" of gaming ;) and it was a hefty step up from the route building found in Ticket to Ride. Will play this game in most situations and won't really turn it down, even though it can be a longer game. Plays up to 6, if you're brave. Really a game that I will be growing with for the rest of my life. Go buy this game, it deserves your investment.

I only played this game once and it didn't take too long to learn. It's not exactly the theme that I normally get into or gravitate toward, but after playing it I was pleasantly surprised at how much fun it was and how cool it was. I like the way the supply and demand of commodities is represented and can dictate different strategies during the game, as well as the auctions for the power plants. I like the way it balances with the last place player getting to buy commodities first. 

I guess the only thing that I wasn't sure about, is why would someone buy property out west (in U.S. map) when it cost so much and the eastern half of the U.S. was easier to build and power. Perhaps there's a reason and in only playing once, I wasn't able to see it.

Having now played a few times I've really gotten to like this game.  The balance between bidding and actually trying to juggle the resource market is quite the challenge.  So far I've won every time I've played, but have seen the game come down to the last decision on the last play, or even been a run-away blow out.  Bidding on power-plants really seems to be a fine art in this game, and with the random factor of some plants not even existing in the game I can see a lot of replay value in the future.  Looking forward to trying the other varient boards in the future.

I held off on this one for the first few years after getting back into games, mainly due to the theme - don't make the same mistake! This really is a classic for all the right reasons. Turns whiz by, there's a nice mix of area control, auctions and money/resource management, while at no point does the boring theme interfere with the fun. A very clever and strangely charming game.

Joc econòmic de subastes on els jugadors han d'optimitzar l'inversió del seu capital generant energía mitjançant la compra de centrals eléctriques (per subasta) i la construcció d'una xarxa de distribució. Les subastes son molt interesants. L'interacció ve donada (a més de per les subastes) per la col·locació al taulell i per la compra de les materies primes necessaries per fer funcionar les centrals.

Joc molt matemàtic, pot tendir al AP si es vol optimitzar al màxim cada acció. Escala malament a menys de 4 jugadors, només recomanable a 4-5 (a 6 es pot fer una mica llarg).

I have played this a lot, and it has rapidly become a favourite of the games that I own. Combines a lot of elements that might make a good game on their own - auction, connection building, resource management - and cobbles them together into a coherent whole, focussed around the balancing act of turn order. Timing your expansions and when to stay static and wait to get more advantageous turn order is the strategic heart of the game, with the purchasing of connections, resources and plants being more tactical. And both are thoroughly interesting, and impact on each other constantly in enjoyable ways. 

I like this an awful lot. Have invested in the expansion maps and am on the lookout for the new powerplant deck. Consistently satisfying. Just played 2 player for the first time and it wasn't as bad as I had been expecting. Balancing turn order seemed the most important thing, money seemed pretty readily available (played on France)

RATING: 8
One of my earliest favourite games. I like the fencing-like jockeying for position to be as close to last place as possible during the auctions, but still close enough to the leader for the final sprint in the right time. This game can cause some AP because it has elements that can be counted beforehand and others that can be predicted fairly accurately.

My pet peeve with this game: Players who say they don't like that the game is against the leader. If you are at the head of the pack, you are not the leader, you are a walking casualty of the true leader behind, not even knowing that you're already lost. This is also my favourite part sometimes, because it's fun to watch people who think they're doing good and brag about it, when you just know you will be able to feed those comments back to them in the final round. I have issues, I know. :)

RATING: 3
Basically, I think this game is too random.  You win by hitting all cylinders (making a big surge in cities and having enough energy to power them) at the right time, but it's very hard to know when the ending turn will happen... you have little control over it.  I hear that Funkenschlag (the German edition) has some additional control, because the fuel resources are limited enough that you can purposefully stall leaders by buying up all the fuel.

I really don't want to play this game again.  Whether I win or lose, I just feel like I have no control.  Sometimes, I feel like I have a chance to win, but the game ends a turn early.  Other times, I feel like I'm playing for 4th place (out of 5 or 6), and then due to some small perturbation, the game lasts one more turn, and I have a chance to win.  Yes, luck is a part of every game, but it's just not fun to try and build a strong position when there's no reward, when small things *regularly* make huge differences, game after game.  The game also gets bogged down in analysis paralysis, since you want to avoid all the small perturbations. For example, if I buy extra fuel this turn, will I be a little short of money during the building phase?  What if the players before me build in an unexpected direction and I have to pay more for my builds?  All of that has to be calculated before deciding how much to bid on a power plant, and sometimes before deciding which plant to bid on!  Not fun at all.

I got rid of this game after an incredibly brutal game in which one player actively tanked their turns and dragged it out. This is not the kind of game in which players can easily 'opt out' of once in (or at least not without creating somewhat of a vacuum).

This isn't to say that I don't think that this is likely Friedman Friese's best game to date!
-----------------------------------------------------------
Update Sept 2014: 7->6
I'm not sure that I'm as enamored with this game anymore as it becomes explicitly clear that this game does not favour a mix of people playing differently. In other words, this game highly favours players who mathematically grind their options -- however, this also takes a fair bit more time when players do so. Personally, I prefer games where the valuation is unclear so that a playing by the seat of your pants is not only an option, but encouraged (which in turn shapes a good game flow).  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Fantastic game, with auctions, resource management, economics, fluctuating resource prices and network building. There is a catch-up mechanism in the game, making it close to impossible to lead the game from the start to finish. This makes timing critical- you have to position yourself to take the lead just when you need it towards the end. Understanding this balance is one of the keys to victory.

The auctions can be a lot of fun, and being able to evaluate the right price for a power plant is another key to success. I was somewhat sceptical to the auction, not thinking that is would go down well in my gaming group, but it has actually turned out to be very enjoyable. 

This game is, although it can be analytical, very fun. Rules are easy to learn - what separates the experienced player from a newbie is the ability to understand the timing, balance between expansion and capacity, and power plant prices. It may sound complicated, but it really isn't- after a game or two, most players will be at a level where they have winning chances. Can be tense towards the end, and victories are typically with small margins. One of the highest rated games on Board Game geek, and understandably so. It provides some depth, without being too complex for the mass market.

Power Grid is such a great game. Easy to teach. Slow build and a great finish. This one allows several opportunities for players to step out in front and take control of the game. Although being in "the lead" isn't always a great place to be. I think that's what I like about this. It forces you to be patient and to watch for your opening. Always a favorite!

This game has always been a bit of an enigma to me. What is it about Power Grid that everyone else seems to like so much? I like network building games, I like economic games, I like auctions. But this? No. It's so fiddly, and slow, and the calculation involved is so laborious. So much effort is expended playing this game, and so little fun is generated. I wanted to like the game, and every once in a while I try it again, but so far I've always confirmed my opinion. It's just not that good.

Time rolls on, and opinions soften. Bumped this up to a 6. I'm not saying this is a classic or anything, but after a four year break from it, it was a nice change of pace. It helps if I don't have to be banker, auction house manager, turn order tracker and fuel market filler.

My preferred mid-weight Euro-veined game. Every single phase of every single round, you can really feel the brilliance of the tight game design! Tailor-made for a really passive-aggressive crowd, as you can always indirectly hurt someone with every single decision you make (and directly if that's what you so choose). The rubber-banding mechanic forces all the players to play chicken on being the leader, and it makes the game feel unique for it. If your group is anything like mine, you end up harrowed over competing for very miniscule increases in efficiency during the auction phases; it can get tense. Power Grid is awesome awesome awesome, what else can I say?

Not really my cup of tea, but I do play it occasionally because friends love it so. There are other economic engine games that I prefer.  Undoubtedly my play experience is sub-optimal since I usually play with people who have played it A LOT and have more talent with economic engine games.

Finally got in a play of this game. It's so fantastic looking it kept distracting from game play, no kidding. This is a tough game with lots of math. I put myself out of the game kind of early by not winning auctions for power plants robust enough to support expansion. But that didn't hinder me from enjoying this game. I really want to play again and suspect that my rating for this will go up. The only fault is that the math is so important that it could grind the game to a halt if too much time is spent in calculating options, but the rewards for doing so were obvious in my first playing. But more than anything it comes down to when to make your move, which works for me since I'm a more seat-of-your-pants player.

RATING: 9
Rules a bit fiddly, but the game works. You need to pay attention to all aspects of the game - power plants upgrading, securing resources, connecting cities - and at the same time optimising your expenditure and earnings. Needs planning ahead. After each game that I lose, I can think back and determine exactly why I lost.

RATING: 6.5
A good game- suffers a bit from the fact that the best strategy is almost always to stockpile, wait for the shuffle, then explode onto the board and try to win.

Being a strong frontrunner early never leads to winning, which is a *huge* problem with games with this sort of mechanic (it's similar to the problem in Munchkin where the person in front very rarely wins, but for different reasons)

Just a great game. The mechanisms are clunky and the game seems to lurch along like Frankenstein's monster, but like Shelley's classic, it makes for a very entertaining ride. Games come down to the monetary tie-breaker far more often than one might expect, and it always has a cut-throat competitive feel. I like how the board "grows and shrinks" and resource renewal changes, acting to keep that competitiveness alive with different player counts. The expansions only add to the variability and calculated fun of this one.

I played it first at the boardgame club and i was not sure if it is a good game or not. But fortunatelly my friend told me that it will be fantastic and it turned out that he was right. It has easy rules yet really mindblowing to think and plan ahead. I like that you start with crap power plants and just like in real life they are getting better and better over time. I love the fact that we invest money into power plants, resources, and city connections and after we earn the money for it.

Pros / Cons:
-I love the possibilities of blocking each other by getting the city first, or just buy all the resources and the get rid of an opponent power plant.
-I like the mechanism so if you are in the last place you buy the best and cheapest things, but you have to feel when to jump into the first place it is like a scale.
-Low luck factor is a big plus.

-I don't like the fact that to play a game takes 2 hours, i prefer to play till 1,5 hours but after the downtime just gets big calculating how to build cities in the end.

I have an odd affinity for economic games.  Not that I'm particularly good at them, but they're very enjoyable to me.  Power Grid does a great job with the system it has.  The game itself feels different each time, depending on what plants are coming up, what the markets are doing, and what is available to build.  When you are trying to calculate down to the dollar on what you should do on your turn, you definitely feel the pressure, and it's especially interesting when you screw someone else by just the dollar or two they need.

The turn order mechanism is great too.  Even if you're behind in the buildings, and not making as much money, you get prime picks on everything else that round.  It's a very delicate balance of money, resource, and pacing mechanisms that I enjoy every time.

For a game I like as much as this one, a more substantive comment is clearly necessary...

Power Grid, the industrial-looking, system-connecting, area-control, point-grabbing game with the funky and fairly demanding auctions.

This flagship 2F game is still satisfying, no matter when it gets pulled out, no matter what country the maps are overlaid upon.

Each year the new promo maps are hot grabs at Essen, because in it's essence this is a pretty nicely interactive game that rewards good play, the supports larger groups, that demands money management, resource control, a sense of timing and good judgement.

I don't always pull it out, because I don't always want that kind of time commitment, but it is always rewarding when I do- that's the essence of true classic game, and why this is the only top 10 BGG game that is in my personal top 5 games.

Don't like it as much as most people.  I feel like the best strat is to hold back so you can always go first and then just set yourself up for a big last turn to finish the game.  That kind of bores me.

Power Grid is a modern classic, which has stood the test of time (13 years is a long time now in board game years), despite its flaws. In fact, some elements of Power Grid make it less streamlined than some of its newer counter parts, but I believe some of these elements make it that much more timeless.

First, let me list some of the "negatives" about Power Grid: it has a finicky setup, unintuitive round and game phase structure, analysis paralysis/lots of number crunching in the late game, and sometimes tedious game states. Furthermore, you have to play this game often to play it right - there is a lot of rule book searching during play. That's not to say Power Grid's mechanics are difficult, but there are quite a few very specific rules about what happens when, and the way the game evolves as you play does not make these game-state changes feel natural.

That said, I think it is partly because of these negatives that Power Grid is such a tense, albeit slow game. Power Grid has so much space for decision-making, and players actions are so intertwined in that space. Furthermore, even if one stage of the round is tedious or unchanging, it just makes the other stage(s) that much more important: sometimes the auctions are critical, sometimes the resource purchasing is the difference between a win and a loss, sometimes the actual location of your network is essential, sometimes the turn order matters, etc. I have seen late-game upsets and unconventional starts turn into wins. But it always seems like the player who plays the best, wins.

My biggest gripe of Power Grid is the game can produce a lot of Analysis Paralysis. It can grind to a halt if players overthink their turns. Over time, it moves faster, and also, it really is just part of the game. However, if players insist too much on analyzing and predicting every possible outcome, it will take some of the fun out of the game. I think all boardgames are about reacting and deciding in a reasonable timeframe, and may the best player win as a result. We may not always agree on what a reasonable timeframe, and maybe some players like that over analysis. However, most players will agree that some just take too long at Power Grid. I guess just push them along or get a stopwatch.

I love Power Grid. It isn't super streamlined, and someone will need to be referencing the manual most play-throughs, unless you get the game to the table all the time. It's easy to play a rule wrong or miss an upkeep condition. Nevertheless, Power Grid is tense and has an amazing space for making interesting decisions. The importance of different aspects and mechanics can change from game to game. Surprisingly, Power Grid is not super punishing to new players, but the best player in any game will likely win. The best player is the player to make the best decisionss in nuanced situations.

Now one of my favorite games, there are so many things I like about Power Grid. The supply/demand mechanic, giving the player in last an advantage to keep them relatively in the game, the auction mechanic for plants, and others. Not real fond of closing off a section of the map at times, but that's not enough to lower my rating below a 10. Great game with many things going on at once.

I played this several times, and tried to like it.  I felt that the accelerating price mechanism was an interesting card game, but lost the theme.  

I won once, but was underwhelmed.  It did not seem to have a lot of interaction, or a lot of strategy.  The game kind of left me flat, which is quite unusual, because I like a lot of card games.

I haven't win this game, but I still have enjoyed playing. There's so much to discover. Every decision you make is really important and affects to a lot of things, so you have to be sharp all the time. Very interesting game.

I've been playing with 3 players and I see some problems there. There's always room for each player to be in a city, so it doesn't create true conflict in that regard. I have a feeling that the game would be far more interesting with more players as you have to plan your network more carefully. I hope I can play this with more players some time.

There is lots of math in the game but it's not that difficult (it's only addition). It can be frustrating to calculate if your money is enough for the whole round to do all the stuff you want to do, but still it's not so bad.

Itching to play this one again.

What's not to love with this game? well run markets, competitive bidding in auctions, network development!!! It combines all my favourite elements of many different boardgames and delivers them superbly

I've updated my opinion of this game from 9 to 10 but I belive it is only worth a 10 played with 6... 
5 players is about 9.5...
4 players is about 9...
3 players is about 7...
2 players is about 5...

The 2 player rules adjustments are good and it scales well when you consider it plays best with 6 but I would rather play with more

Plus the power plant card expansion kinda sucks

Although it is a brain-burner, requires three hours, and is relatively unforgiving, it is a fun game. It was one of the first Euro games I played, along with Puerto Rico, and Settlers of Catan. The auction/future market, the resources market, and "worst goes first" mechanics were like nothing I had ever experienced in any game. This could be considered my first "gateway" game, where I truly enjoyed it on its first play (previous attempts with PR and Princes of Florence made me roll my eyes in frustration). This opened my eyes to a world beyond Risk, Guesstures, Monopoly, Diplomacy, Titan, Talisman, and other Ameritrash games.

Update (06/13/09): Taught this to four newbies (two couples) at a game day. Surprisingly, all picked it up fairly quickly--just need to get through one turn to understand how the game works--although several hints were needed throughout the game to prevent disastrous moves. All enjoyed it and considered it a great game. With knowledgeable players, a 5-6P game will take no more than 2.5 hours.

Update (02/29/10): Played a custom Great Britain board. This 'system' has a plethora of game boards of a variety of geographical areas.

Update (06/18/10): Doesn't get played anymore as people think it is too long and complex. Where's the love?

Update (11/06/10): Under the seemingly civil exterior, this game can be competitive, nasty, and cut-throat: the calculated auctioning of power plants, the resource market manipulation, boxing in players' cities, and crafty posturing of the turn order. Oh, I love it, but some people could get turned off by it.

Update (10/14/2013) 13 plays: Ah, good ol' Power Grid... you are starting to show your age. It is tough to get people to play you nowadays, with all the shiny new games coming out, but especially with the rather random and chaotic nature of the power plant market and auction. Still, a "10" in my book.

This game is long for the fun I get out of it. I want to like it, but I find it too fiddly and too tedious. I keep thinking that I'm not giving it a fair shake though so my rating is still tentative.

10/19/2014 update: This is, to me, the board game version of an Excel spreadsheet, and this is coming from someone who loves euros. The bidding is fun, but I find the rest of the game far too tedious. I'd still play this over many other games, but I think, if memory serves, I prefer something like Factory Manager over this just because I get the bidding without the city building, which is a part of the game that doesn't intrigue me that much. Also, this game is terribly AP prone. I don't believe I've played a game of this that lasted less than 2.5 hours. It's a game a respect and will still play, but rarely will I pick it.

[i]This is Power Grid.[/i]

(To keep the profanity to a minimum, I will use the barely appropriate euphemism "fudge", though the bowdlerized form ends up sounding even dirtier what with the slight connotation of fecal matter being involved.)

[i]Power Grid[/i] is one of the best Euros possible because of the endless opportunities to fudge your friends.  And, unlike the usual passive-aggressive glory-hole fudging that happens in most Euros, Power Grid lets you look 'em in the face while you go at it.

You get to fudge them in the auctions...

"I didn't want that stupid plant—I just wanted to watch Elektros fly out of your head."

Fudge them in the commodities market...

"I'll get around to using all this coal eventually.  But you, you'll be hemorrhaging debt into your underwear."

And fudge them most thoroughly on the board...

"Yeah, you're in the gimp suit until Step 2—whenever that happens."

Is [i]Power Grid[/i] really all about grudge-fudging?  Yes, yes it is.  And violence, too.  It's all sex and violence, what with the teeth-kicking and arithmetic.

I suppose we could play like little Fonzies* and stay out of each other's way... but the first person to get out the duct tape and baseball bat will win, and then it's on to machetes and AKs.  And once the groin-kicking starts, you can't go back to just holding hands.

Sure, there's the whole "peloton" thing, which is probably supposed to act as a rubber band for the stragglers, but in reality it's just a mechanism for lining up boots with startled mouths.

So if you ever want that "just fudged" feeling without taking your pants off, I suggest you sit down with a bunch of people who don't love you and play [i]Power Grid[/i].  (Board-flipping and fist-fights optional.)

GET SOME!!!

Don't know if this a good or a very good game. Definetely the best game by Friese. The main problem is that the weight/time ratio is too low. Also a great problem is that if you play the start poorly enough there is no chance to win the game. If the duration was shorter this would not be an issue. Also the player interaction is not high enough for me. Maybe I should try this again to proof that this is better than the first impression implies.

This game just feels like the perfect euro-game; plays in under two hours, there is just a smidgen of luck, fresh theme, doesn't get bogged down too often and very rewarding to win because everyone more or less could have done what you did. The double-sided board is a nice touch. 

Don't have a desire to play this as much anymore. Every game is basically the same.

What an amazing game this is! I am strongly thinking about changing it to a 10 (and I did). The more I play it, the more I like it. The strategical maneuvering here is great and the correlation between game life and real life economics is fun (supply and demand, etc.). I think it makes a great educational game for teens as well as a great game for serious gamers. The game is simply put, elegant. If I had a dollar for every time someone said, "Doh, I am a dollar short!"

THIS IS THE ONE....IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT...YOU ARE MISSING OUT ON THE GREATEST EURO GAME IN EXISTENCE

That being said, this is an intellectual and strategic economic game. Meant for the serious gamer.

And the expansions with all the changing rules - Brilliant!

This is a fascinating game which unfortunately outstays its welcome. The core design is sound and the variability of the resources market makes it an interesting simulation, but the game I took part in took 2.5 hours and the game had ceased to be enjoyable after the first 1.5. With a shorter victory timescale, this game would be amazing, but I don't think i'd have the patience or interest to play this in full again. And as with other games of which we no longer speak, it become very clear throughout play who is going to win and who isn't, but the game drags victory out to the final round, making the endgame a chore for most.

Note to self: save the Green strategy for the real world... UPDATE!Played again, using a "hybrid" approach of coal, garbage, and wind, and won! This time, it really "clicked" for me. Bought the cheapest plant out the gate, to have first crack at placement. Got in the Northeast (playing the US board), and had lots of cheap expansions, quickly.As much as I enjoyed it this time around, there's a real runaway leader problem, where the rich get richer and richer. I was able to expand out early and enjoyed a lead for the entire game. I didn't mind it in this play, of course, but would be disgruntled if I were on the bottom side of things...

Yes, there is math:  you have to add to and subtract from your money frequently, and plan ahead during the auction phase so that you don't short yourself necessary funds in the resource phase.  If that more math than you want to do on a turn, you will not like this game.  If it is ok, you probably will.

Brilliant! Very tense and satisfying even if you lose in the last round. Seems to work best with more than 3 players. 

Edit after dosens of plays (9.5 => 8): There seem to be only one winning strategy in the game and the winner is the best performer of this strategy. This might cause a little wear-out feeling when not really able to "try something different this time". Still, pretty damn good!

Also a good choice when someone asks you about some Monopoly-like game. It has houses and money, so in most cases it's enough to attract them to something million times better ;)

The only bad thing I have to say about this game is that, I don't like when board games make you section off parts of the board because there's less players. For that reason, I only want to play this with 6 players so I don't have to section off any part of the board. I don't mind if the board is double-sided to play for different number of players though.

A great game for mathematicians with very good self balancing to make it a good game with a mixed crew (although, as has been commented, balancing won't quite work if there is a handful of players all doing very well and a single straggler). Love it, but I did learn it with a group of friends who had also never played it before and this was rather painful.

What really bugs me about this game is the need to figure out during the auction stage how much money you'll want to spend on resources and connections. This is a tedious combination of reading the other players and arithmetic which I would be happier without.

The fiddly power plant market rules are a pain, but as long as there is an experienced player who can be given that job they don't ruin the experience. Still I can't help but feel that this should have been better polished.

This game is an appealing, thought provoking game.  However, there are several things that get to me about it.  One, there is a lot of bean counting in the game that can really slow it down.  Can you afford to pay one more dollar for that power plant?  What about your opponent?  Lots of potential for analysis paralysis here - and also with the all-important turn order.  Yes, you can affect the turn order, but you do that by holding back growth artificially.  This really doesn't feel like running a power company. And finally the ending feels anticlimactic.  The game declares a winner but there is no feeling of having accomplished anything for the losers.  In fact, it just becomes apparent that one player has won and the game just... stops....  There is no obvious "second place" to try for once first place is beyond your grasp.

I realise that some rave over this game, but it doesn't really work for me. There are some challenges in the timing, but I can't see much value in going early in turn order. You want to be going last as often as possible as that gives you cheapest fuel and cheapest build, but doesn't stop you bidding in the early auctions.  There's also the luck element of a really juicy power plant coming off the pile for the last auction and the game can turn on that possibility. (I invariably end up thinking that the game would be massively improved if the lowest plant in the top row always came down to the auctionable row, rather than fitting in a blind draw.) Although described as an economic game, there's no parallel with reality here and that makes this a complete turn off (no pun intended) for my way of thinking.

It took me a while to get into Power Grid--but this is an engrossing game that runs smoothly, too. It's really about deciding when to end the game, and  one of the things that makes this a really great game is the degree to which its workings (turn order, the economy, cities available, game length) can be manipulated.  It offers a high degree of control and a lot of really interesting things to think about--but at the same time, there is a high degree of tension that comes from not know exactly what will happen next.

This is the first game I give a 10 to.  There are multiple layers of economics, yet all simple enough that the game only benefits from it in every way.  The gameplay is meaty and the tension and excitement grow as you get closer to the end.  Great variety of board layouts for being a game with static routes.  Excellent cartoonish art.  Quite possibly the greatest Euro I've played.

Great! A lot of tough descisions combined with good player interaction in both the bidding segment and the commodity buying phase.  Do I buy that much needed power plant now for some much needed revenue or do I hold off for a more efficient one later?  Should I obtain rights to that expensive city now in order to block my opponent from building there or do I obtain multiple rights in cheaper areas?  Will garbage prices continue to drop?

A good, interesting strategy game, with a few caveats.  There are always a lot of tough decisions to make each turn, and the game really requires a lot of attention to what the other players are doing, which is a good thing.  However, the endgame has some flaws which really keep it from ever getting to a 9 or 10 in my book.  First, the game nearly always results in a tie, especially as the player count increases, leaving the tiebreaker (most money remaining) to decide the game.  It feels very unsatisfying to burn your brain for 2 hours only to have victory snatched away by someone with a few bucks more left at the end.  Also, the game is great with 3 or 4, but really doesn't work that well with 5 or 6.  The luck factor involved in the power plant market really increases as player count goes up.

The game's art and style are really great.

A humdrum game of accounting where you know how much money you've got, how much you need for houses and fuel and that tells you how much you can spend on a power plant.  Going first can give a huge advantage as you can get all the cheap connections in the early game.

Where the tension in gameplay that others see in this game comes from I don't know.  It's just an exercise in arithmetic wrapped up in an electrical field.

A pioneer in gaming. Great resource-management / route-planning game. VERY MATHY. Not for everyone. Every turn needs to be planned in advance, and for this reason, I think the banker has a disadvantage. Player interaction is moderater. Similar to ticket to ride, but with the addition of the power plant and resource auction. Both of which can be somewhat anticipated.

This is a masterpiece of a game. It is extremely simple to learn how to play, the mechanic is logical, but there is huge depth and scope for strategy. The balance of strategy to luck is exactly right, with the game being comprised mainly of the former and with just a touch of the latter - enough to keep the game varied and unpredictable but not so much that planning isn't possible.

Every time I've played this with people they've had an amazing time and have wanted to play it again, and with all of the expansion maps the scope for replayability is so large that it's almost a genre in itself. I understand now why this game is the institution it is.

Soy el primero en admitir que es un buen juego, aunque no he notado que fuese tan bueno como para estar tan arriba en la lista y además considero que está bien diseñado... tan sólo es que olvidaron poner la "diversión" en el prototipo...

There are some games that are great because of the way they weave together different game mechanics into a cohesive whole.  Power Grid is not one of those games - it is basically three completely separate mechanics (auction, resource market, and network building) that are played out sequentially one after another.  The reason Power Grid works is two-fold: first, that you have one pile of money to distribute among all three phases of the game and must figure out the best way to optimize the funds you have; second, the way each phase subtly informs your decisions in the other phases.  

Played with the right group, Power Grid is a lean, ferocious game that is tense all the way through to the end. I'm a sucker for auction games and resource markets, so this game really hits a sweet spot for me.  The only things that keeps this from a higher rating are 1.) There are so many other games that I just like more, 2.) some weird fiddly rules that are easy to forget, and 3.) this game is especially prone to analysis paralysis, particularly during the endgame when everyone is trying to figure out if there's any possible way they can build just one more city.

A dash of negotiation, a little bit of luck, and a lot of bidding, Power Grid's theme is weakened not by any lack of art on the board, but rather the amount of arguing (in a good way) players will do with each other. The game's one major downside is difference in player familiarity creates large gaps in gameplay experience.

Well, it was one of my favorite games. I haven't played it in a really long time, and I don't miss it all that much. I wonder if it's still one of my favorites.

This is a interesting game on many levels.  There is lots of strategy to figure out and some luck as well it appears.  The first time I played this I immediatly enjoyed it.  The 2nd time was the same.  It might take a couple of plays to get the game mechanics worked out.  The biggest issue with the game might be that it requires more time to play, however that time will seem to fly by from my experience.  Worth a game play when you have the time.

-------------------------------

[i]Power Grid[/i] is a game where players take the role of power companies and attempt to become the most prosperous by purchasing, fuelling, and building their power plants in order to extract revenue from the population. It does this through simulations of a resource market, auctions, and network building on a map. It is for 2-6 players, and the sweet spot would be around 3, 4, or 5.  It is highly strategic, and requires good mathematical and planning skills to be able to master.

This game contains no real single mechanism which dominates the others; it is quite a good amalgamation of several, each with its own phase. Each player is involved in each phase equally, and has a vested interest in watching what the other players are doing, as they may require that power plant they have put up for auction, or need a certain type of fuel at a certain cost, or need a valuable city connection on the board. Having mentioned the importance of being aware of the other player’s moves, I should also mention that there is plenty of decisions to make in isolation, as you are constantly making decisions that affect your efficiency in ways that are likely unforeseeable until the end of the game. This is what I enjoy most about Power Grid; the fact that you have to juggle the needs of the other players with planning your own future, and the time pressure can sometimes be quite daunting.

There is also great replayability, with variable power plant orders and different maps that can be used and different zones that can be selected on each. These all lead to quite different games and play styles. One downside that I have noticed is that it often seems to come down to however is able to get the best power plant at the end, but since I play with mostly 3 people, I cannot comment as to whether this is a major problem, or just from overplaying of a single ‘setting’. This is one of my favourite euro-strategy games I have currently, and will likely remain in that position for the near future.

[b]Pros[/b]
- Strategic depth
- Meshing of several key mechanics
- Good player variability
- Excellent decisions to time ratio
- Almost no downtime

[b]Cons[/b]
- May be too mathematical for some
- 2 or 3 players can be a bit repetitive
- Luck may play too large a part

When I first played this game I felt giddy to play it again.  I have enjoyed every play and find that the mechanics are a nice blend that suits my fancy.  However I find that others do not like it nearly as much as I do and therefore it does not get as many plays as I would like.  As far as plays go I always use both the Flux Generator and Station promo cards.

This is a nice game of tight resource management.  The graphic design work struck me as very clean and easy on the eyes.  My one complaint comes from the heavy accounting when buying resources or building factories in cities.  It would have been nice if the whole system was scaled up to accompany multiples of five for adding purposes.  The way in which turn order was done makes it a nice mechanic as it keeps the game pretty tight throughout barring any catastrophic failures on one's part.  The game is probably one of the better dry-themed Euros I've played.

Update:  That crashing sound you hear is my rating for this game.  Power Grid in the end, for me, is too much work without a payoff in fun.  The math drives me nuts after a while and the gameplay isn't all that variable.  I'm just not a fan of this one anymore.

Nice "mathy" game as everyone is calculating how much to spend on resources to drive up the price on others, but still be able to buy the cities that they need.

RATING: 3
Power Grid is a lot of fun on the first 2 or 3 plays.  However, the events and strategy of the game becomes quite repetitive and predictable on subsequent plays.  The value of the power plant variety is diminished by the need to take a minimalist approach save for big producers (6s or 7s) in the late game.  The progression of city expansion in each phase often feels the same.  On top of all this, it takes a substantial time investment with the undisguised math min/maxing.  I would strongly prefer to play most other games, even vanilla Settlers of Catan, as they are much less predictable.

No cards and no victory points!  You don't see that very often.  So darn fiddly though.  If it rolled a little faster I'd love it.  I still appreciate it though.

The different phases fit together like a tight puzzle.  You burn resources in your power plants to provide power to your real estate to get money to buy the stuff all over again.

Power Grid is a different market trading game, with a neat energy theme and interactive feel that provides some lasting appeal and dynamics, especially with many players.

However, even as a mathy guy, the game often feels like it should be called Spreadsheet Factory. It is a bit too mathy to be able to just sit back and enjoy the experience.

Also, I don't think there are quite enough dynamics in the game to keep one interested. There is the energy market, the placement map and the random power plants, and that is it.

A decent title, but not great. I'll play when my friends ask, but I find it relatively tiresome.

RATING: 8.5
Very strategic and engaging, but very dry. The number-crunching involved is a little straining, and I'm not a fan of the way auctions immediately refresh (getting the best factory in the market only to see a better one become available by chance is frustrating in such an otherwise strategic title).

Very large and heavily mathematical game.  Not recommended for families or for introducing people to gaming, but a solid game for enthusiasts.  

The main premise being to construct power stations which generate power to the grid you construct on the board, the player that is able to generate power to a set number of homes first is the winner.  I like the auction mechanics, and I have to admit to quite enjoying the many calculations that you must run through your head in order to plan ahead effectively and not run out of money or materials at the wrong time.

The only problem I had was that at towards the end of the game, I didn't have the power stations that could supply enough power to win the game, and no suitable replacements were left in the deck - although I had tons of money and resources it was literally impossible for me to win because of how the deck happened to be arranged.  This was a bit annoying after playing for quite a long time but I still enjoyed the game.

I'm not a huge auction fan, but I appreciate the use of supply and demand in the resource market combined with the network process. I enjoy a little more immersive theme in my games.

12/01/12 update
Moved this game up as I have played this more recently. I appreciate the subtle runaway leader penalties inherent in the game through the turn order. Between good players it reminds me very much of a tactical middle distance race where each game involves considerable jockeying for position in the first three laps while hoping for the right opportunity for the first turn on the final lap (the auction). Each power plant flip determines a likely course of action, but with a nagging doubt about what may be available on the next flip. 

4/06/14 Update
Will always have a place in collection because such a great game for five or six. It's easy for relative new gamers to pick up because all the concepts are so familiar--auctions, buying resources, building a network, being paid.

This is a fun game. I have no real complaint and everyone in my family likes to play it. Especially those who enjoy Euro games. It plays really well with children ages 7 yrs up. I really want to rate this higher, but I can not think of why it deserves it. It is not an extra ordinary game; although, I like everything about it and would not change anything... I guess when I really think about it there is perhaps too little challenge and it seems all of the players get close to the goal at about the same time, regardless of the choices they made. It is nice that no player gets left behind, but still it lacks those memorable moments when players were close, and it came down to 1 roll of the dice or 1 decisive choice that gave one player just the "little bit" they needed for a surprise win. 
       I really enjoy this game and highly recommend it. Every time I play it I am engaged and enjoy the time played (be warned the game does take longer to play then the box says). My family enjoys this game and I am glad I have it. It is an easy going experience. It is not intense or exciting in any way. Perfect for day when you are looking for a game that is easy going.

I played the original crayon-rail Funkenschlag back in the day, and it was the game that really opened my eyes to how deep these games of ours could get. But in the years since I've come to realize that PG is a bit longer than I'd like, many of the rules are more fiddly than I'd like (e.g., transitions between steps), and playing well requires more math than I really want to do. It is a classic though.

A well-designed game, though I don't really get why it is in the top ten.

Strengths:
The implications of turn order
The auctions, including choosing which plants to offer and when

Weaknesses:
The board play isn't particularly compelling
The game is rather dry and arithmetical, with few surprises

I don't mind tight games where everyone is trying to do the same thing and success comes from being subtly more efficient than everyone else, I just think their play time should be no more than an hour.

It was a success though and we're looking into playing it more. My favorite thing about the game is they sell seperate boards with new maps.

Funkenschlag (2nd ed) is among the heavier and lengthier German games. It does not have particularly complex rules, nor does it offer deep strategic possibilities. However, on a tactical level it really shines. In my first few games Funkenschlag seemed to be mainly about careful turn-by-turn management of resources in order to optimise your position, with some possibility for affecting other players through e.g your decisions on where to build. But with experience, I began to appreciate the more subtle tactical possibilities (which revolve around the mechanics of determining player order, the effect of player order on which power stations you can put up for auction, the mechanics of the fuel market etc). Despite a certain amount of simple number crunching, this game can generally be completed in around 2 hours. Funkenschlag has a great theme, more than adequate components, and the double-sided board adds some variety. Small gripe: electricity grids do not consist of rusting metal pipes (where are the pylons?)

i've wanted this game since the first time i played it (finally picked it up in Aug08). i enjoy everything about this one - bidding on power plants, the strategy of the board and the purchasing of the raw materials. i truly need to get more plays in on this one, but it's hard to find 4 people to play. i usually only get in 2 players with an occasional 3 player, so PG doesn't hit the table as often as i'd like

To me is the German board game equivalent of Monopoly (better designed of course).  It’s easy to get introduce new players to this game, I think in part due to its theme.  The only tricky part is at the very start of the game you choose positions and it is possible to pick a bad one.

I will warn that the rule book is horrible and took us several sessions of playing full games before we finally worked all the rules out.

I really wanted to like this game.  All the hype really had me excited.  Then I played it.  With 6 players, it really seems that the game is a steamroller type where once you fall behind, you are out of it completely with no chance to catch up.  This is very disappointing as the reviews have been quite good.  Maybe this will go up with more playings, but it won't get many more, and for now, it gets a 5.


Update:  Played again and it deserves nothing more than a 6

Update:  More plays with alternate board improve the game, but ONLY with 4 players.  5-6 is tedious and boring

A good auction/economic engine game. After repeated plays it does kind of seem to depend too much on trying to buy as few power palnts as possible while still keeping in shouting distance of others.

Sold of as it got no love from my game groups and my wife had if not quite solved it, then started to feel a bit bored by the lack of challenge me or our playgroup offered.

After many games of this, I have come to the conclusion that the order that power plants come out is way too determinative.  While I appreciate the shorter game, its just ridiculous to watch 4 out of 5 players helpless to win because only one useful power plant comes out in the end game.

:thumbsdown: Power Grid-style bidding frustrates me to no end. The inability to [urk=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check-raise}"check-raise,"[/url] combined with the inability to bid on more than one plant is unintuitive, and makes the game less interactive, and less interesting.

RATING: 7.5
I've been winning this game a lot recently, focusing on a "get capacity early" strategy, and staying behind in the city race. Remember, while you can buy as many connections as you can afford each turn, you can only buy one plant. So early capacity can enable you to rush to victory before your opponents can successfully react (especially if they've all been gradually building up).

Game of juggling money and resources to purchase and operate power plants in order to see who can power the most cities and thereby score the most victory points.Lots of strategy and means to accomplish your goals gives this game much love on BGG. Games are fairly long running to 2 hrs or more.

Initial rating after 3 games with 3 & 5 players. 

I really like the concepts and mechanics in this game and the theme is great as well, hopefully my next games will improve. I can see why the 2 player won't be as interesting but I want to try it anyway. 3 was good and 5 better although it seems in the game, you don't really cut someone off as much as you think might happen, one guy just built right over me paying the costs. Then just when someone might get screwed, the stage changes and he can build where he couldn't before anyway. I would have liked to have seen more jockeying for position, otherwise the auctions are interesting but the rest of the game just comes down to calculating for the best optimization. 

It also seems hard to stop the leader as the rich get richer, maybe there will be more area influence in my next games, more plays will tell. Punishes early mistakes, and whoever gets to pick where to build first has a distinct advantage as far as I can see. The easier to build in areas probably should pay a little less come money time to balance it out further IMO but that opinion might change. Fun game that needs more plays to know for sure...

[u]UPDATE[/u]: 8.5 => 8 I enjoy this game and think the midgame is excellent but the ending can be  determined by the flipping of a powerplant, maybe this wont happen often not sure yet but I'm not a fan of this kind of ending to a 2 hour multiplayer strategy game.

This seems to be a game of finding the right tempo, which I found pretty interesting. If you shoot ahead too early you might fizzle out and people can pass you, but if you don't stay within striking distance people can end the game on you before you get everything in place. This is all centered around manipulating the turn order mechanic, which is really clever. Near the end since things get pretty much calculable the game can slow down quite a bit as everyone tries to figure out exactly how much money they need to get everything done. But that's a minor concern for me and doesn't stop this from being a fun, interesting game.

Good game but I don't care for it anymore. I can totally see why it's so loved though. Great theme, art, mechanics. I love the fight for land on the map. But, I think it inflicts serious and problematic AP. You must allocate the right amount of $$ to buy the right amount of resources to power all of your cites while trying to save the perfect amount to buy more next turn. All the math takes the fun out of it for me. Also, no matter how good you do, it always seems to come down to the final 2 rounds. If you don't make the perfect play then, you're screwed.

Simply a fantastic game! I played Funkenschlag a while before Rio Grande put out Power Grid and I'm still amazed that they ware able to do such a fantastic job steamlining the new version. It provides the same uniqueness and excellent play as the original but also makes it more accessable to the average gamer who might shy away from the crayon rails aspect of Funkenschlag.

Update:  It's so frustrating that we hardly play this game!  I have the three official expansion maps plus at least one unofficial map. It's almost a crime that this doesn't get played a few times a game at the very least.

Power Grid is a acceptable game that combines several mechanisms: area control, auctions, resource market influenced by demand, last player goes first, etc... and the end result is a very engaging game for gamers, with every game different owing mostly to the semi-random plant market. I found this a bit too "linear" (predictable), not very demanding in strategy, only calculating cheapest way. I wish it was deeper and less "solved". Overestimated.

For some reason, some people who play this see the ending condition as a reason to give up if they don't think they can win which can cause a different person to win than would have otherwise...very irritating and a blot on an otherwise excellent game :/ (or maybe this happens in games more often than I realise, and the power grid ending condition makes it more obvious)

One of my favourite games and one of the most balanced boardgames I've played. Rio Grande did a nice modular design with artwork, I felt the map looked overly busy first time I played but got used to it after a while, love the colour scheme, game looks daunting at first but after initial play, comes very naturally. Highly recommend. Also, general cost of game at retail is usually quite reasonable.

RATING: 7
I love some of its mechanics and concepts, especially the escalating nature and strategic uncertainties, but the game can flat-out drag--too much math combined with looking at the board ("I have $162 and there's a 17 connection... and a 12, and a ... hey, I could get a cheaper one there for 15... let me recalculate... wait, that's a 15 city..."). Play with people who know what they want to do before their turn arrives. Not recommended for non-gamers.

How the cards fall is just a little too lucky for a game as demanding as this. I've been in too many games decided by a certain plant arriving or not arriving. I'd probably give this a 5, just going by how much I want to play it.

Fun game.  Provide power to the cities on the map.  Get money for doing so.  Use money to buy more cities and powerplants and fuel for the powerplants.  Powerplants are the core of the game and are acquired through auctions where bidding strategy is everything.  Also there is a spatial strategy in what cities to buy, obtaining control of the choicest areas.

Love it, love it, love it.  I love how the three mechanics intertwine, and I am a sucker for lots of pretty bits (especially if I get to fiddle with them often during play).  ;)

Update: played with 4, and this game is DREADFUL if even one player suffers from AP.  A game that usually takes us a bit over an hour took us almost three.  This is particularly painful when, for the last hour, the two experienced players knew they were mathematically out of it . . .

For the most part, I play with one other player.  PG is an outstanding game but I do feel we miss out at 2 players, even with the robot.  We use poker chips instead of the supplied paper money and find that it speeds up game play.  Unique mechanics and great design.

RATING: 9
Even after dozens of hours of gameplay, I have yet to tire of Power Grid. The management of the three core systems (auctioning, resource management, and route building) along with one of the best catch-up mechanisms in a board game form a compelling system where each game plays a bit differently and players must constantly adjust the pace of building their energy empires. While it can be overly cutthroat and slow down as players get into minute optimizations, Power Grid has provided more than enough tough decisions and tense moments for me to keep it permanently in my collection.

Finally played my first full game.  Good game with a high tension factor.  There is a lot of angst, but the decision trees are small, so individual actions don't take very long.  (little AP)  However, all the calculations that a player must constantly perform does make the game drag.  In this respect, it's similar to Age of Steam, although I think Power Grid has more opportunity to play faster.  I'd like to play again.

This game would score higher if it was not so long, but with a group who knows how to play and can dive right in, it stays interesting throughout.

Often seems that multiple plays are very similar, but the mechanics are well designed. This is one where your opponents competing decisions may hurt you, but without too much blatant attacking of your fellow players, which in this case, is a good thing.

It's no wonder, then, that I enjoy this game.  It's a lot heavier than most of the games that I rate highly, which skews the results I get from the stats algorithms people post from time to time.

Rating after 1 play.  Introduced it to four decidedly non-gamers and had no experience with the game myself, but it went remarkably well.  The decisions are complex, but the rules are not hard as long as you can remember the little "checks" one has to do for end of step, discarding plants in the market, etc.

Nice, heavy and long economic game, reminiscent of both 1830 and German-style games. However, it suffers from grave randomness in the power plant auctions, as well as from a tendency for game flow inbalance, where games phases tend to either stagnate or feel rushed. A game that could have used the hand of Knizia in ironing out the little (and great) inbalances.

This game is about balancing spending to increase the number of cities owned and the capacity to power them.  There is a lot of math, but the luck of the draw on the power plants can have an effect.

This game is far more than the sum of its parts. The different phases of the game are very simple, but interesting play emerges in the interaction between them. Deciding what to emphasize (income, power plant capacity, the fuel market, turn order) at each stage of the game is important, and there is no clear answer as to what is the right choice. I believe there are many subtly divergent paths to victory, and I like that.

One play was very tense and tight.  I'm not a fan of bidding games, but this would probably be the one to get, since I could actually calculate the cost:value ratio (as opposed to bidding for turn sequence).  The acceleration of the end game caught me off balance.

I am blown away at how well this game holds together. Every little piece of it fits together perfectly, and any little move you make (overcommitting to a specific resource, bidding a little too high on a power plant, spending too much of your money on building new cities before you were ready) has a real effect on how well you do, but without feeling forced. Really a masterpiece of game design, and the only downside is how long games can take. This is very much not a party game, but if you have a few hours and you have a group of thinkers, this is the game you want to play.

RATING: 9
This is a really well designed game that is always fun to play.

But the more I play it, the more I get annoyed at the end-game.  The beginning and middle are so much fun, but the last round always seems to drag out as the top two players try to figure out if they can win this turn, and usually, only one of them can, but the other guy just doesn't know it yet.  It's frustrating and anti-climactic, even if you're the one who jockeyed into position for the guaranteed victory.

It's still a game that almost always goes over well, even with people who don't play a lot of board games.  Works just as well with the "monopoly and poker" crowd as the ones who own games themselves.

RATING: 7
Having played PG more now, I see it for what it is - a faux economic engine game where your actions are oftentimes forced by the power plants that are available, and what the other people are doing.

I've played too many games where the plants stall randomly, where buying one will always benefit someone else more than oneself, and I find those occurrances kind of annoying.

Then again, I say this because I'm good at rough, mental calculations.

Still rated an 8 because it's enjoyable, but there's too much randomness for the length.

I really enjoy this game. Very well designed and not as fiddly as some other top ranked games..ahem (looking at you Agricola).  This is a really good economic game, and models supply and demand real well with the resource market.

I can't help but to think to myself this is almost like a train game but with power plants.  Powering up your power plants is like "pick up and deliver".

Love the game. The resource market is not simply dice determined, like what you get with Settlers. It is determined by supply and demand. Really neat way of looking at adjusting your resource needs according to what you predict others will need or want.
Like it a lot, but can be a bit slow without the newer power plant cards included.

The decision to buy power plants or resources by opponents, determines your strategy. Once played quite an easy game to play again.

Also with the rules their are limitations on the number of general land areas to use, meaning that for 3 player games, on the USA map alone there are 12 different game areas that can be played.

The more I play it, the more I like it... It is definitely a re-playable game.

Initial rating: 6.5 (December 2010)

As Power Grid is one of the better ranked games here on BGG I was expecting a great game, I didn’t like my first play, or my second for that matter. I really wanted to like it, but (sadly) I don’t. So today I gave up my pretense for the game and rated it according to my real feelings.

The game components are ok, the theme is awful but the gameplay is boring and uninspired, if I want to play an Euro I go to superior games. Most of my games had a clear winner from 3 turns (or more)  before the end so I find the endgame to be extremely unsatisfying. Too long for what if offers. Awful art and cover. I don’t find it heavy enough as its reputation would have me believe.

Bottom line, a very boring game. I would play again if requested, but I will try to resist it, fortunately, almost all of my game buddies share my views of the game.

After four plays I'm not finding this as good as I hoped, but better than my very 1st impression. Room for on-the-board strategy seems limited in 2P. I saw BGG comments saying "stockpile resources to drive costs up for other players" but haven't seen a situation where that's relevant, in as much as if someone had somewhere to keep the resources they usually wanted to fire the plant. In the end game buying un-needed resources seems to cost you more than it takes from your opponent. The competitive bidding aspect requires we have more experience of the relative values of the plants.  All in all I think there's a bit of repeat playing before we can get the most out of this ok-seeming game, but these days I don't get many options for repeat playing with the same multiple players.

The bash-the-leader mechanic is a little clumsy, but there are quite a few innovative elements to this game, especially in its blend of positioning tactics with economic optimization.

I think the resource market really makes this game.  Players who can effectively manipulate the turn order and resource purchases gain a decided edge.

For awhile I had the base game rated lower than my favorite expansions, but they're really inseparable.

Don't really enjoy this game as it feels too "mathy". However, I haven't tried the highly recommended 4/5 player games so I expect my rating to change once I've played them. The games so far have been fairly predictable and boring. Maybe it's too dry?

9/1/12: Played 2 games with 4 players and I must say, the game really shines. The fun factor has been ramped up and I'm giving this a "9" now instead of "6". A fun, competitive game that is best enjoyed with your peers. Recommended.

I like the game.  It is interesting and different enough that it really feels fresh.  

With 5 players we play that you need to power one extra city.  This makes it harder to get a big enough plant early that you never have to upgrade.  We also toss out the lowest plant at the end of each round because we were ending before it got to phase 3 (this gets us to phase 3 before the game ends).

Update 12/2011 - Dropped the rating from 8 to 7.  I much prefer Power Grid: Factory Manager.  I know that it is a different game, but the underlying principles are similar even though the mechanics are not the same.  Given a choice I would always choose PG:FM.

Update 2/2017 - Tried to give this another shot.  Dropped the rating again.  My kids, now adult, dislike it enough that it will not get to the table.

I really wanna like this game but I have such a hard time getting into it.  My first five games were decided by a matter of a few dollars.  Some find this as a true asset to a well crafted game but I would have to disagree.  I won't refuse to play this game but there are many others I'd pick before this one.  Also my game didn't come with the money...I'm trading this but there's no currency to the game...easy fix though with all the other games out there that use currency.

Man, do I love this game. It is very fun. My only complaint is that the end can often leave you feeling very unsatisfied. The end is almost always rather anticlimatic. 

This has been a real surprise hit with my non-gaming friends. They sat there with bored indifference while I explained the rules and I feared that it would be a complete failure with them but 1/4 of the way into the game they started talking amongst themselves about how much fun they were having. 

Some tough decisions to be made. Some fun auction action. Not nearly as "fiddly" as people say and the "math" that everyone seems to be complaining about is simple addition...not sure what the problem is.

A great game with little luck involved. Everyone is always in the game and always feel like they have a shot all the way to the end.

RATING: 9.5
- Classic game. Old version is just as good as the new one.
- This game has so many great elements: board positioning; power plant auctions; resource market... Soo good.
- I love the decisions as everything is a trade off. If you push too hard for board position, you probably won't have the money you'll need to buy the best power plants and/or the resources you need to power all your cities. On the other hand, spend too much on power plants and/or resources and you won't have the money to expand early enough on the board. You have to toe the line and take advantage of opportunities just at the right time.
- I like how the value of plants and resources depends on what people are doing/using. If any one player is on to a good thing, then other players are encouraged to join in, which makes it not as good a thing...
- It is quite mathy in that you regularly need to sum multiple numbers in the teens, but it's not that bad. I actually enjoy the mental arithmetic.
- Fun with pretty much all player counts, though 6 can take a while. 4-5 players preferred.
- Teaching is not that hard.

RATING: 9
Given the time to play (with experienced players I would estimate 20-30 minutes per player), this is an outstanding longer game.  WARNING:  It is fairly math-heavy, and players should get in the habit of pre-calculating costs of building and estimating costs of materials.  

Of course, this is precisely why I like this game.  The flow is fairly natural after becoming familiar, and decisions can hinge on the production/cost of only a couple of elektro (dollars).  Two levels of interaction (bidding on plants, and racing for network access) make this a tight, highly competetive game.

A twist on train games that's challenging and with no messy crayons. The best thing about this game is that it can be played by 2 players or multiple players and it adjusts evenly.

Much cleaner than the first edition and possibly better balanced.  Scales very well from two to six players.

After playing a few more times, both face to face and on BSW, I think that this game could crack my 9-10 threshold. There seems to be a lot more strategy than first impressions provided.  I'll adjust my ratings after playing a few more times.

I think that the novelty has worn off.  The expansions have seemed to water down the game to the point where I might drop my rating instead.

It's a good game design, but ...  I guess I just don't like it as much as I should.  It's kind of nice to own power plants and all, but somewhere it drags, and takes a bit longer than it should.  I'll probably give it another chance down the road, but the last two plays have been disappointing

Maybe the first game where I really fell in love with the mechanics.  I love the auctions and rudimentary route-building on the board but for me this game is all about the resource market.  The way it simulates supply and demand and changes the balance of power with the turn-order is so well executed, I honestly cannot think of another game that blends it all together so well.  I also love all the maps that were added later, each changing the game ever-so-slightly.  It's just a beautiful game from a gameplay/mechanics perspective.

The object of Power Grid is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network gains a predetermined size. In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they use to power their cities.

Haven't seen this one on the table for a while, not the games fault.

This is a fun game and has enough going on to be challenging in a more adult group as well as family. I must add that my 6 year old is advanced for her age and most six year old kids wouldn't grasp this game.

This is a great game with an interesting marketplace mechanic.  As you purchase more of a resource, it becomes more expensive.  Unique way to determine turn order.  Paper money is a common gripe for many, but I don't mind it as much as I probably should.

The built-in mechanic limiting the frontrunner from running away with the game is very frustrating when you are the frontrunner, but appreciated when you're losing.  Power Grid gets very tense towards the end, and it almost seems best to accelerate slowly at the start of the game and come on aggressive mid- to late-game.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is such a very cool game.  Buy power plants, buy fuel for the power plants, buy connections to cities, then use the fuel to power your plants and sell the energy to your cities for profit.  It's so satisfying to build your little economic engine and gobble up the map.  The fact that everyone else at the table is trying to do the same thing and there are limited resources makes for some great tension.  The only down side is that the game takes a long time to play and a lot of that time is spent in analysis, contemplation, and calculation.  Avoid at all costs if you're the type of gamer who simply cannot hold it together while someone else spends 3-5 minutes silently staring at the board and counting on their fingers.

Power Grid is an amazing game with layers of strategy and a constant string of decisions to be made. The game gets more exciting as things progress and it is often unclear who will win until the final round. It is very accessible for a game of this depth and richness. An instant classic!

28.10.2009: The rules are a bit fiddly and it takes a while before you remember all the small details. And there's lots of counting. However, once you've played it a few times you realize that you don't have to count every last Elektro. After a few plays the fiddly rules aren't that fiddly anymore and then you can start to really enjoy this great game.

A very 'tight' game.  It comes down to the wire.  Lots and lots of different decissions.  No bluffing.  But this game just works very well together. It's often very hard to 'cost' the best option for yourself.  But it's so much fun to try.
2014: update the big difficulty is the learning curve on the game.  I don't get to play enough to overcome that.
2015: Still really enjoy this, I have two friends who play this with me enough I got an expansion.  Still very good.

Rio Grande Games edition.  A very tense and calculating economic resource-management game with subtle layers of sub-games/mechanics.  Bid for plants, buy fuel, connect cities... repeat, all while dealing with increased cost in resources and changes in turn order.  Game length is a bit long for us.

Note:  The Rio Grande edition includes a B&W photo copy of the rules that are just awful for the first time player.  I strongly suggest you first familiarized yourself with other help-aids posted on this site, then play a shorter version of the game to the end of Step 1.  -enjoy!

My rating is for Power Grid. It's nice that the fixed routes exist in this game since it seems that Funkenschlag bogs down while each player is counting out routes in order to find the cheapest one. PG simplifies that and in a good way. A good economic game that can be played in 2 hours.

Update: I'm done with this one. I've really come to hate the stall that happens with players as you get further into to game. I feel that with experienced players the winner is going to be determined by the way the power plants come up and who gets the most "keeper" plants at or slightly above cost.

The more I play this game, the more my respect for it increases. The game only gets more interesting as it progresses and the end game can be fascinating. The game IS money management. If you enjoy calculating exactly what things are worth and what you can afford, you WILL love this game.

I'm discounting it a bit because I don't think the rules/mechanics are as smooth as they could be. There are a lot of circumstancial rules that are difficult to remember. It's klunky, but that's part of its charm. This game is heaps of fun, despite its short comings.

The GERMANY map is probably the best basic map in the game. The USA map is mostly played in the east and midwest, as connections to the west can be prohibitive. Not as balanced as germany, but still fun.

Este juego va de comprar recursos para centrales energéticas y alimentar a tantas ciudades como se pueda en cada turno.

Para esto necesitarás dos cosas: centrales energéticas y ciudades. Tendrás que pujar por centrales energéticas en la fase de subasta, cada una de ellas consume un tipo (o varios) de recursos. Tienen un precio de salida, cuanto más alto sea el precio, mayor es su potencia.

Por otro lado, también necesitas alimentar ciudades. Empezando con una ciudad, tendrás que expandir tu red energética a través del país, pagando el coste de tuberías y emplazamiento en las ciudades. Una vez que tengas centrales energéticas y ciudades, sólo necesitarás los recursos adecuados para hacer que todo funcione.

En mi opinión, es un buen juego. Su núcleo está en la fase de subasta, debes de saber cuando tienes que presionar a los otros jujgadores y cuando tienes que retirarte. La expansión de tu red energética es también muy importante para cortar las redes de otros jugadores.

This game is about buying resources for your power plants and feeding as many cities as you can in each turn.

For this you will need two things: power plants and cities. You will have to bid for power plants in an auction phase, each  of them consumes a kind (or several) of resources. They have a starting bidding price, the higher this price, the better its power.

On the other hand, you need cities to feed too. Starting with a city, you will have to expand your network across the country, paying costs for pipes and city placement. Once you have power plants and cities, you only need the right resources to make everything work.

In my opinion, this is a good game. The core of the game it is in the auction phase, you need to know when you have to put a little bit of pressure on the other players and when you have to have to retreat yourself. Network expansion it is also very important in order to cut other players networks.

What draws me back to this game is the auction of the power plants. I do have the feeling that turtling is a viable and maybe necesarry strategy to win this game, which is a pity. You can calculate alot, which means this game is prone to AP (at least for me). (25 feb 07 after 9 plays)

Hmm.  There is a lot that I like about this game.  I like the tile placement elements of making connections and "blocking", the supply-demand model with the resources, and the resource management challenges.  What I dislike is the endgame.  You can manage to have a ton of cash to do what you need to win, but ONLY if a useful powerplant gets put out during your auction phase.  Powergrid seems to demand too much time and work to position yourself for what may ultimately come down to luck of the draw at the end.  At least thats been my experience in the games I have played.  If someone outbids me on a powerplant I need to win - thats one thing, but for me not to even have a chance because no good plants get drawn on my turn is very frustrating for all the time and effort invested in it.  Its like playing a marathon chess session where you can only win if you also draw a better poker hand after checkmating your opponent.

Okay time for a comment revision:

I really like the auctions. Weighing the start-up cost, production capability, and future efficiency of a plant against other players needs and desires is fun. However, the rest of the game is somewhat obvious and boring.

RATING: 7
 To win, you have to manage your resources in three categories:  (1) purchasing power plants; (2) purchase and manage resources; and (3) connect cities on the board.  A major screw-up in any one of these categories and you are in serious trouble!  Manipulating the turn order is another important tactical factor that gives the game its flavor.  Also, efficiency is rewarded and really the major luck factor is who gets that juicy power plant on the flop for face value versus having it bid up if there is competition.  Games can be one or lost by spending or fail to spend the extra dollar for resources.  Finally, accurately predicting what turn the game will end and planning for it can be crucial.  Every game is a tense struggle, filled with gut-wrenching decisions throughout.

   Update:  October 2007, dropped the rating from a 10 to a 9 given that in recent games, it seems to come down to one player getting a nice power plant for face value.  Then, often the power plant market becomes jammed, making it difficult for other players to catch up.  The only map this seems to be less of an issue is Benelux, given that there's a more rapid trip through the Power Plant deck.  Hopefully, this issue will be addressed by the new Power Plant deck, which is due to be released soon.

  June 2012:  Dropping the rating to an 8.  While I still think it's a fine game and enjoy a play from time to time, it's not one I am seeking out today, and generally will look to play newer titles if given a choice.  Power Grid was in my all-time top 10 for a long time, but today I replaced it with a much newer and lesser known title, Village, that has received alot more play recently.

  Dec. 2015:  Rare for me, re-rated for the third time, dropping the game to a 7.  Will play but not as enthused as others.  The new DeLuxe version from a year or two ago has breathed some new life into the game, not sure that the Stock Market version from this past Essen adds all that much, however.

Outstanding game, but the components fit together a bit awkwardly - the auctions, supply and demand driven pricing and area control mechanisms all operate fairly independantly, but it still works.  Catch up mechanic SEEMS very strong, but experienced players will always beat new players.  There really can be a runaway leader but it takes several plays to realise this - new players will genuinely think they are doing ok until the game ends, which can be a sudden moment.  This is one of those games where you can win or lose and still not be sure what you did right (or wrong).  It really can come down to just a few dollars of money so every decision is crucial.

Update:  Power Grid is a good game, but the downtime can get a bit much, especially with 5+ players.

[b]Old Comment:[/b]

Fun economic game with intriguing resource market that actually responds to supply and demand (oooo!, neat!). Nice art style / sense of humor. Can be very competitive. 

The game isn't all accounting, but for me (and the majority of people I've played with), turn after turn goes a little too much like this:"I have X money, so I can afford up to Y for a new power plant, leaving the necessary Z for resources and Q for infrastructure, netting me P in profit." That's a lot of repetitive arithmetic over 120-150 minutes. Still, good game. Will continue to play. 

[b]New Comment[/b]:

It's taken me a long time to warm-up to Power Grid. Like Agricola, I think this is a game that has an almost deceptive "broad appeal" that deflects you from its intrinsic "hardcore gamer" qualities. Power Grid has only opened up for me after many sessions of supposedly heavier economic games like The Scepter of Zavandor and Indonesia. 

What I find unique to this game is that you must master a kind of strategic amplitude. Approaching the game from a mere efficiency standpoint (buy more, make more) won't get you very far. Instead, you have to time your powerplant and network upgrades with precision. You want explosive expansions followed by deliberate (and highly profitable) lulls. In a game that feels so clearly calculable, there are always tough decisions regarding board position, opportunity cost, timing, etc. 

The more games I try, the more I see the [i]enduring[/i] quality of Power Grid. It is a clunky, ungainly game that continually produces situations that are both absurd and somehow engaging. Potentially frustrating yet navigable.

This is an auction game in which you are buying various types of power plants. The plants generate money which is used for the auctions, to by resources for the plants, and to buy new city connections. The value of the resources changes with market demand so one must consider the market conditions to decide on what power plants to buy. There is also a network building aspect as you look for the cheapest routes to connect your cities. People tend to call this a mathy game. I suppose there is some of that, but I enjoy playing it at a more intuitive level.

9/10, -1 point for the nit-picks given below.

I've played this once, against a single opponent. I enjoyed it very much; I plan on playing it with my gf and, if she likes it, buying it and playing it often.

* The potential turn-offs, if you're not like me:

There's a lot of math. Like, each turn you count your money, plan out how many houses you'll buy and what your resources are going to cost, to figure out how much you can spend in the auction phase. You should also consider what the supply and demand does to the price of each resource, and how much more money you can earn by getting bigger power plants that let you power more cities, and how much that costs.

That's a lot of math. Like, seriously, a lot. I like math. It was my favorite subject in school. At university I minored in math. I sometimes read math articles on Wikipedia for fun. Using math to find the most efficient power plants, house layouts and connection prices in order to win at board game? Sign me up!

The artwork uses many different colors: cement grey, steel grey, smoke grey, overcast dark cloud grey, power socket grey, smoke black, coal black, oil black, coal brown and soil brown, spiced up with a little bit of construction truck orangey-yellow. Lots of earthy colors and a drab, industrial look, which goes great with the theme of the game, but some might find this boring and lifeless. The power plants look a little bit... cutesy, I guess, but in a way that preserves the "hardhats and bean counters" tone. It's all well done, crisp, easily readable and inoffensive to the eye, but you only taste some of the rainbow.

Also, it's long. My game lasted more than 3 hours. That's a lot. It's a lot of fun, yes, but it's also a lot of time. The opportunity cost is 2-3 games of Pandemic, 3-5 games of Dominion, or ~50 rounds of Coup. I'm sure it speeds up as the players get familiar with the game—Adam Horton claims it can be played in under an hour (source: GIYF).

* The nitpicks:

There's a board divided into regions; you never use all of them at the same time. The game doesn't come with anything to cover up the unused part, or indicate where the separation lies. Whatever the solution is, it would've been nice if it came in the box. You can probably improvise something use the rulebook, some reference cards and money, but it's never going to look all that great.

How much money you have is something you're allowed to hide, even though it can be calculated by everyone given only all the public information; that adds busywork which is strategically relevant at high-level play.

The paper money is flimsy and doesn't feel all that awesome to handle. Maybe the choice is informed by making the quantity something you're allowed to hide. Some people suggest using poker chips instead if you have 'em. That sounds reasonable to me.

* What makes the game work?

Here are some of the elements of the game which I think help make it fun: there's a reasonably clear goal: build houses and power them. There's a reasonably clear notion of the best means: buy plants, fuel and houses cost-efficiently. You can plan a few turns ahead reasonably well given just the public information, and the nature of the player interactions imply that you ought to. That invests you in your turn-by-turn decisions.

* Some facts for those who don't know.

The nature of the competition is such that you can never* deprive your opponent of an opportunity, you can only make that opportunity more expensive for your opponent. Money is part of the win condition, so doing this can pay off. It's a general truth that if I hurt myself and hurt one opponent more, that's a net win in 2-player games, and 2-player games only; hence the 2-player version can be more cutthroat than with more players. Overall, the money part of the win condition is influenced by accruing many small efficiencies; each micro-fight matters, but none of them decide the game on their own.

(* it's possible for resources to fully dry up, e.g. for there to be no more coal. That happens more often the more players there are in the game, or so I hear. There is a maximum of three houses in each city, and each player can have at most house in each city, so in 4+ player games some cities can become unavailable to you.)

There is an element of randomness. There's a deck of power plants that's shuffled at game start. Eight of them are in the market at any point in time, but you can only buy among the cheapest four. After each player buys a plant, a new one is drawn from the deck; if its cost puts it in the cheaper half of the market, it'll be available for purchase, but only to those who haven't bought a plant in the current round.

You can minimize the impact of randomness through strategery, by positioning yourself later in the bidding order. You can also estimate the probability of lucky draws ahead of time: there's (at most) one power plant at each list price. If the market boundary is between the plants with list price 22 and 23, you know that 23 will be available to the other players if you buy 22. If the boundary is between 20 and 27, any plant between 21 and 26 might show up and become available.

There's a fixed initial market, and the number of plants towards the end of the game is small-ish, so the random variability occurs most often around the mid-game, leaving you enough time to catch up by outplaying your opponent if you get screwed by their good luck. Luck matters, but it's not game-decisive and you can play towards low variance (or make the luck benefit you).

I benefited from this element of luck at least once. Maybe that's why I won my first game, against an experienced opponent, but I think part of it also had to do with me driving up the price of coal when he went for an all-coal lineup, and getting a good contain around his Essen-centered network, almost reserving both Hamburg and Berlin to myself, circumvented only by his very expensive long-distance expansion into my territory. I hear that it's not completely uncommon for new players to win their first game.

* Political messages in (and not in) the game.

There are eco-friendly power plants (windmills). They don't require resources, which makes them cheap to operate, but they power a small number of houses. Ultimately you'll want the dirty ones for their greater capacity, but you'll happily take the green ones mid-game to help you make money. The game never says "eco-power rocks" or "eco-power sucks", but the differences in benefits implies something about the attractiveness of eco-power.

Also, apart from the auctions the price structures are nowhere near perfect competition. They resemble oligo-/monopoly/-psony (few/single sellers/buyers) a lot more; I assume the money you earn from not powering any houses is a government subsidy; and the house construction rules imply heavy licensing requirements and discriminatory barriers to entry. In this fashion, the game might subtly normalize cronyism and interventionism over competitive markets—or, much more realistically and probably worse, conflate the two in the minds of a lot of people.

By Power Grid's nature as a competitive game, one person's victory implies every other person's defeat. Commerce is almost always mutually beneficial, and the exceptions typically imply unethical behavior on the part of at least one party (for example, fraud or other forms of deceit).

The individual auctions are turn-based open-exit English auctions, similar to poker-bidding with only "raise" and "fold"; the fact that you can only buy at most one power plant each round makes the auction system differ from institutions that are socially efficient in ways I don't know the exact implications of—though I suspect that selling two power plants in a VCG auction, which are efficient, could result in one party buying both, and this can't happen with Power Grid's auction system.

If you are seriously concerned about any of this, you should also worry that playing Axis and Allies will turn people into Nazis, that playing Twilight Struggle will turn people into commies, and that playing Monopoly will turn people into real estate speculators.

What I like about PG is turn planning. You have to budget for expansion and resources with plans A and B in mind then determine what you can afford to spend on a new power plant. Opponent's desires in all phases are important making player interaction very high. You have to find the rhythm of expansion and optimization which I really like in economic engine games.

We never play with more than 4p because the game has too much downtime. An AP prone player can really drag the game into the mud. Sometimes your ability to do well feels crippled by other's moves, this is unavoidable with such high player interaction. Part of the game is avoiding this, but when it does happen it can feel very shitty. There is also the possibility that the person screwing you over is playing sub-optimally which really sucks. To some extent this can be avoided with the right group, but this dependence on group type for enjoyment is the biggest flaw in the game IMO.

Good game.  Great that there is a good strategy game that plays six.  Can be subject to downtime when playing with six though.  Perhaps 4/5 is the sweet spot?
This game focuses on resource and money management.  Timing is critical.  Fun game, but can be tough and the maths may put of some.
I think the is an advantage in going first in terms of getting to the good map locations.  Probably depends on the map.

Power Grid always made me weary. The theme seems ridiculously boring and the artwork was too green for my taste. However, after consistently seeing it in the top 5 ranked games on this website, I decided to give it a go. It is a heavier economical game, with various mechanisms carefully intertwined. And surprisingly it worked for me, as for a large portion of the boardgaming community. This game is incredibly tense and exciting. Not only spactial tactical placement of your houses, but also clever bidding in the factory market, and buying resources at the right moment: this is one of the best games available.

Running a power company? Perfect topic for me. Much better than the 100th medieval game. 

The mechanisms of auction, resource management and network building fit together to make a smooth and challenging game. While I'm not too fond of auction games in general, it doesn't disturb me here. The resource market is modelled in a great way and feels true. The network aspect is a bit in the back.

With more play, the leader balancing mechanism might become disturbing as it feels gamey for me to stay intentionally behind to leap forward in the final moves. Not as bad as Masons in this concern but could be bothering.

The graphic design is among the best I have seen and support the theme.

Looking forward to playing this again.

This game balances so many elements in logical and clean ways. It holds attention throughout, and it is packed with strategy at each different action (though there is usually a somewhat clear BEST strategy). I'm also impressed at the design of the game board and the fact that it is double-sided. It feels like a great value.

I was surprised at how much my wife took to this game. I thought it may be a bit complex, but I think she was able to follow because of how much sense the system makes. Doesn't hurt that she is good at it, too.

Update: I'm sick of playing this with new people as I keep seeing the same arc throughout each game. The auction just doesn't have enough to separate it from any other auction game. The rest of the game is mired by a dependence on turn order manipulation.

5 July 2009  Just played this one last night.  Was a little wary because of some of the comments here (too maths heavy, dry, etc).  Had a blast! 4 player. Loved the auction, the commodities, building and connecting to cities.  Loved earning the filthy lucre at the end of building.  We groaned when we made a mistake in the auction, laughed when our friends made one.  I nearly won after having lagged behind all game.  Couldn't detect a runaway leader problem.  Had plenty of opportunity for catching up.  This one is 'heavy', in that you have to be aware of what's going on all the time and you have to watch your cash a lot or you'll get left short but this was a plus for me.  A nice break from Puerto Rico. I'm off to buy this one, this week. :-)

9 July 09 Played a 5 player last night.  Great time. My friends tend to stay away from wind power cause it's a little weaker than coal/oil. I didn't and had enough to win the game. Yay.  

2 Aug 09 I'm bumping this to a 10.  Love this game.  Even when I lose I've had a great time.  (Note to self, never get caught up in a bidding war). Favourite map so far - Poland I think.

23 Jan 11 3 player game. A real blast. Lagged behind all game and then came thru and won right at the last. We love the bidding element of this game. It's great driving up prices on each other and trying to get a bargain in the meantime. My favourite player number is 4. This game is so good because everyone's had a great time at the end of the game whether they won or lost.

2 Jan 2013 - For some reason this game got boring. No-one wants to play it anymore. Have switched to First Sparks as it's shorter and more fun.

My favorite of the heavier categories.  

I think I like it because the progression is linear. Your position changes in a linear fashion, and each turn you have a different set of choices to make, unlike Puerto Rico where every turn you are choosing one of the same five or six roles.

Seems to lack catch-up opportunities, as the main contenders ar evident by mid-game. Up to that point, the game is anything but boring. I'd rate this higher except that if you fall behind early you are in for a long difficult game. I also think that the accounting is high maintenance, perhaps the reason I find this game so tedious. There's too much money exchange with the bank over the course of the game.

Update: Hmmm... just finished a game in which I made a heck of a late game move to finish 2nd. Lost the tie-break by $10. I felt cash-poor compared to the leaders, but was stingy as hell and made sure my power plant upgrades were significant and had staying power. Playing from behind isn't horrible, but you have to stay as close as possible in network size so the money doesn't seem so overwhelming.

I haven't been too excited in the past to play this, despite having a copy, but after teaching it (and thus having to learn the rules better than when I was just playing it), I find that I understand it better and got more out of it.

I've only played the short (phase 1) game.  So far, we've also only played with incorrect victory conditions too.

We think this will make the game even better.

A classic for me - one of my first euro games. Maybe even the very first. The theme is awesome and auctioning power plants is a blast. Can be a bit long as our group all tends to prepare hard for phase 3 (sometimes skipping phase 2 as no one wants to be the one to trigger it). So a lot depends on turn order when phase 3 strikes. But you can win while staying as player 1, or falling behind and taking advantage of last player. Overall amazing game and will never sell it.

RATING: 4
It met my expectations: it's a fairly math-heavy game where the focus is on efficiency optimization and maximizing profits. There's an auction mechanic which felt a little awkward to me (decreasing number of participants). The mid-game felt a bit sloppy (there were several mid-game factories, but it didn't seem to be efficient to buy them; players who leapt to end-game factories scored much better overall). But, worst, I didn't feel there were all that many interesting or exciting decisions in the game. ...Basically, choosing whether to do this or that came down to two questions: "will this net me a profit", and "will this block another player's profit?" I didn't find the game particularly immersive. Table-talk was essentially along the lines of "well, you could go _here_ and block _that_, but _this_ is your cheapest build, and you'd net X more money for going there..."[shrug] ...Not the kind of gaming that I find especially exciting.

I would probably play the game again, but it's not on my "want to play" list... and, unfortunately, it seems to be one of those games you need to invest time into before you're good enough to be at all competitive, and I'm not sure it's a game that's as enjoyable for those with less skill than other players.

I should really like Power Grid. It's just the right weight, including just the right kinds of elements (network building, auctions, timing). And for a long while I played quite a lot of it, especially on BSW.

But too often it comes down to a power plant lottery: whether something is a good buy or not depends too heavily on what the next card drawn is. And it really sucks to be playing for 2 hours, and have the game essentially determined by a coin flip at the end.

I'll still happily play it any time, but I also can't help getting the feeling that it's way, way overrated on bgg.

A game of managing power plants and fueling them to provide electricity to the cities you control. Very nice elegant game, and I find that most non-gamers are enthralled by the game. The game is fairly simple and intuitive and leads to a deep and stategic game.

The game has bad rules translation (minor, because you eventually figure out the Step and Phase thing) and those "triggered-occassionally" rules which are so easy to forget. Probably best with 4 or 5 players.

Economic game with very original mechanics. The players must pay attention to the supply - demand of the resources. In addition it is not advantageous to be first. However in order to win you need to be first, therefore it is very important to rise from the last places in time. I haven't yet learned how to do it.

Ekonominis žaidimas su labai savita mechanika. Reikia atsižvelgti į resursų pasiūlą - paklausą, o be to neišsiveržti į priekį be reikalo. Tačiau laimėti vis tiek reikia, taigi žaidimo pabaigoje svarbu laiku išlįsti iš paskutinių vietų. To dar aš niekaip neišmokstu.

Played it a few times, sat on the shelf for months, and has somehow resurfaced again.

German map is superior.

RATING: 7
Interesting economic game.  However, I do not like the "drafting" aspects of the game--you need to avoid being the leader in order for you to position yourself to sprint to the finish.

My main complaint about Power Grid, which could be considered controversial, is that it is too luck driven for the amount of time it takes to play.  In my opinion, there is about as much luck in Power Grid as in Settlers or Ra, but it takes much longer to play.

On the outset, it doesn't seem like there is that much luck in Power Grid because there are all these calculations and planning that is necessary to play the game.  However, I believe that those are secondary to winning the game.  The key to winning is if you get lucky and get the good (permanent) Power Plants.  If there is a good power plant in the auction and a great power plant in the queue, that's where the luck factor comes in.  Do you bid high and risk that the great power plant goes comes up, or do you pass and risk that an awful power plant is drawn.  To me, this type of decision determines the game, and happens two or three times a game.

Also my group tends to be slow and a game of Power Grid can lasts up to 3 hours.

RATING: 8
A very good game.  I enjoy playing with the base plants, but the expansion power plants do help keep things fresh.  Interesting optimization decisions, but not overwhelming.  The reference files on the BGG are helpful in keeping track of the different game phases and stages.  

I may prefer the analysis of the early game.  In my experience the end game can feel a frantic at the end and the winner can often be decided in the last round by the chance draw (or missed draw) of a particular power plant.  Just part of the fun I suppose.

At first glance this seemed to be a game where whoever able to put his or her stuff on the board fastest wins. However, we soon discovered that a high level of tactical skill is needed which is typical for train games. Everything works smoothly and nerve control is important. All of the good things come unfortunately crashing down because turtling is the only way to play. Yellow vs. wooden houses are a slight minus in darker lighting. There's also way too much downtime included while  others are doing the math considering what you get out of this. Therefore the process of the game isn't fun.

A pretty good game though a bit fiddly and long in person. I think you should be allowed scratch paper for the end game city build. It seems a bit swingy at the end. Still I recognize it as a good strategy game - I will be asking for a lot of other games first though before this one.

The reason why this is my favorite game is the tension arc it has: the stranglepoints and following crashes, the phase transitions, and the threshold-based end game... makes for an intense experience everytime.

While I usually hate auctions, this game does them well. Each small mechanism is a great fit. Particularly love the threshold game end, and the scoring, which feel so different from anything else.

Multiple maps coming with different rules are nice, as are the different promos for it when used sparingly.

RATING: 6
On the plus side, the game evolves nicely and the resource market model is brilliant in its simplicity. On the minus side, the ending was anticlimactic after the game accelerated heavily beyond stage 1 and the leading player couldn't be overtaken. This is a game where players who insist on checking and re-checking their (hidden but trackable) funds against a number of possible chains of events are actually justified in doing so. Not one for the non-gamers. It felt odd that with the maximum number of players, the whole board wasn't used. Rating feels more likely to go up than down.

Update: I like the beginning and mid-game, so it's currently the endgame holding the rating back. And using reversed turn order for everything important still makes a mockery of the common understanding of turn order.

Use poker chips. Keeping money totals hidden [-]may be[/-] is a complete necessity, however. Yes, triggering the end of the game can (and has) become a crapshoot, but the alternative is far worse.

RATING: 9
An excellent, enjoyable, thinky, tightly designed and well-thought-out resource-management game that is both absorbing and remarkably addictive. The design is elegantly balanced and – most importantly – leads to a game that is fun to play. The theme, which might seem dry and unappealing, turns out to be fascinating and well complemented by the mechanics.

It takes about 2 or 3 hours to play, which makes it hard to get to the table as often as I’d like, but because it demands concentration, the players always seem surprised at how the time flies by. 

The board is double sided, and made of heavy cardboard. The art is unique – bizarre at first, but engaging as you quickly begin to associate it with the fun of playing the game. 

The rules are clear and well-conceived, but it’s sometimes hard to find what you’re looking for. I find the “phase” and “step” nomenclature counter-intuitive. To me a step is something granular, while a phase is more regional, so I keep wanting them to be the other way around – steps part of a phase, rather than phases part of steps. 

It’s easy to learn to play the game, but until you’ve played several times, hard to understand the game’s rhythms. I’m still discovering lessons in strategy each time I play. The depth of the game gives it high replayability.

The components are:
- simple coloured wooden bits, which are adequate. The yellow, black and red players’ houses are the same colour as the tokens for garbage, oil and uranium, respectively – which is a pity, but not a problem. From some angles, in certain lights, I find the blue and green pieces nearly indistinguishable. I’d expect colour-blind people find the game difficult to play with the standard pieces. 
- simple but communicative illustrations of power plants on stout square cardstock. They convey information immediately, look good, handle well, and suit the theme perfectly.
- coloured paper money, which I don’t like and have replaced with coins.

Things that would have been useful but aren’t provided:
- thin cards of the shape and size of the areas that are excluded from play. I overlaid a translucent polypropylene foam sheet on the map, outlined each of the areas with a sharpie (having made sure first that it didn't bleed through to the surface below!), marked each of the areas with an arrow and an N for North, and cut to shape. Polypropylene is anti-slip, and stays in place throughout the game. Waxed paper or baking parchment would work at a pinch. 
- a separate card with the replenishment schedules would reduce wear on the rulebook.
- synoptic player aids with a succinct summary of the rules and play phases.

The housekeeping (bank, resource and power station replenishment) is best shared between the players. 

In many cases, players may find themselves short by a single “electro” (the unit of money in the game) for something they want to do. This means that meticulous banking is essential. That seems to rule out any way of keeping track of money except for exchanging with the bank – which is the closest this game gets to being Monopoly.

The game is shaped throughout by strong interaction between the players, and each time it’s your turn to play, you’re faced with another decision – and often it’s one that will impact your choices, and those of other players, later in the game. The game’s strongly interacting mechanics are designed to keep the players constantly close to one another and to allow trailing players to catch up. 

The players themselves influence almost all the elements of the game. They control, to a greater or lesser extent, which power stations are in each player’s hand, how many cities are linked in to a player’s grid and which are made unavailable to other players, and the cost of fuel for the power stations and, later in the game, its availability. Perhaps the most crucial element under players’ control is play order, which becomes increasingly important as the game goes on. There is often a race to the finish in the final 2 or 3 rounds, and play order is usually vital in this sprint.

The game clicks from a first phase (confusingly called a step) in which money is extremely tight, power stations generally inadequate, and space to expand increasingly constrained, to a second phase in which the earlier constraints on space vanish for a while, and power stations become increasingly efficient. The focus in this second stage is largely on generating greater capacity to power cities. The game then clicks into a third and final step in which the focus changes again as money becomes more available, the end heaves into sight, and players prepare to race to the finish. The three parts to the game have distinctly different characters, and while the two clicks aren’t “in theme”, they are well conceived in terms of how the game works. 

The endgame, while tense, plays out rapidly and without fanfare. For this reason, new players, who haven’t enough experience of the game to know when to ramp up, may find the end of the game anticlimactic as they abruptly lose. 

The game design means that each game is different and there is a high replay value.

A design I admire more than I usually enjoy playing.  

I really like the auction rounds for the power plants, the supply and demand inherent to the resource market, and the ingenious turn order mechanic that combats the runaway leader problem and adds all kinds of tactical nuances to jockeying for "last" place.  

On the other hand, I find the rules to be inelegant - it's telling that there is a phase in each round called "bureaucracy."  You have to restock the resource market each turn - but to determine how many resources of each type are added, you have to consult a chart on the back of the manual (not on the board), with the amounts changing by both the player count, and which of the three "steps" the game is in.  This is a bit too fiddly for my taste.  I have difficulty remembering a lot of the more unintuitive rules for triggering the different steps, removing power plants from the market, and how many cities ends the game. 

After a session of Power Grid, I usually feel it was time well spent, but it's not a game I'm itching to play again soon.

I've only been able to try this game a few times, but I have liked it the few I've played of it.  It is a fun game that the jury is still somewhat out on though, so my rating is rather tentative and subject to change.  

So far the two main things that keep it from being a ten are the fact that it doesn't seem to scale well with different numbers of players, and that the deck of power plants can do some very swingy and odd things to make some games play very weird.

*Edit* I've just dropped this rating to an 7,  The game takes a long time, and by the end of it I get sort of a feeling of "Is this over yet?"  Since I'm a person who usually enjoys long games, that is a problem.  Also it isn't really "rules-light" for newer players, yet I don't feel that the depth of strategy is really all *that* incredible.  It seems like you just try to manage your risks and take the best options of power plants when they become available for sale.  I feel like there's more too it that I'm missing though, so I'm going to give it more chances and try to dig deeper into the strategic options of this game.

*Further Edit*

I finally had to sell this one.  I liked it well enough, but my normally Euro-game loving family just didn't dig it.  I'm not sure why really, may have been a bit to "mathy" for them I guess.

2016-01-15 - 6.5 - I played once so far and enjoyed the game. There is a lot of calculation there. I even took pen and paper to the table (is it legal?). There is bidding which I'm not very good at usually. I'm also not a big fan of giving advantage to the last player and in this game it even pays off to be the last. The rules are clean and easy. The market is nicely done. I'm afraid that this game might be a little bit repetitive - more or less you want to get the best set of three power plants. But I know it's a favourite of many people so there is definitely more than that. I have mixed feelings here, but I liked it and I might play it again.

Wow, am knocked out by how well this works given there really isn't that much to it. Auction, buy resources, build some houses and then sort out who gets what cash. Its full chances to outdo your opponents that aren't really apparent when you read the rules. This will hit the table again for sure.

This game is the most popular amongst my game group.  That group is basically my wife, my friend, his wife, and myself.  The game invokes pretty deep thought and AP is ALWAYS going on.  However, since we all know each other, we get to make fun of the tense math happening all over the board.  The game has a pretty abstract way to gain advantage that isn't summed up in a single sentence.  It can be said you can win in many ways with many approaches.  We keep going back to this game because everyone "thinks" they finally got "it" only to find out that what they have planned didn't really help.

I got this game as a gift from my friend after they got a few plays of Kingsburg + expansion.  I quickly got all the expansion boards for the game due to the popularity.  The only reason why I vote it an 8 and not a 10 is that I do tend to win this pretty much 80% of the time, so my enjoyment of it isn't as "high" as when I first started.  Especially now because I "see" when I'm losing and the surprise is gone.  However, the game isn't lower than an 8 either because it brings a "good time" with my game group and no matter how good / bad a game is, if you aren't playing and having fun, then what's the point?

There are games I like but others don't, I rather have it the other way around.  This game gets an 8 for being one that I would gladly suggest to friends and play on a regular basis.

意志を通して配下の都市を拡大させてゆくところが気持ちが良い。お金がペラペラな点、お金のやり取りが面倒、燃料のキューブのセッティングが面倒な点、燃料の石油と石炭が間違えやすい、ソロゲームができない等の欠点はあるが、非常に面白い。拡張も非常にたくさんあり、時間もマップの選択で調節できる点は評価できる。
*ソロヴァリアントがBGGで公開されているし、拡張のロボットもあるので、良さそうに思うかも知れないが、ソロでこのゲームをプレイして「他のゲームの方が面白い」という感じだった。テストプレイやルールを覚えるためならいいが、ソロはそれほどお勧めしない。

After having an initial play through of this game many years ago which I did not enjoy (probably because we were all new to the game, so everyone fumbled around). I have recently played a number of games and found them to be exciting as the changing lead and the closeness of games until the very end really increases the fun. Maybe I should give Agricola another chance too....

Felt incredibly tight in design, but can be hard to auction properly.  I felt like the others in my game gave me some easy wins at auction, then let me have my own little territory on the board and I won almost without paying attention.  Still, I appreciated the elegance of the game and the overall balance between all the different factors.

Beautiful game. So well balanced, it runs like a freshly oiled machine.
2 complaints:
1) too much math
2) with the evr changing board/position/turns..you can spend all the time you want preparing for your turn, but when it's your turn, everything you were planning on is changed...leading to "analparal"

UPDATE:
Complaint 1 – solved by adding calculators to the set up
Complaint 2 - with more plays under our belts, this is hardly the case anymore.

Probably the strongest theme-to-design of any eurogame (at least, in the early game), but has too many built-in levelling mechanisms that keep good players in a tight race no matter what they do.  Seems ultimately to become an issue of buying up positions and lucky power plant draws, with 90% of the game being a fiddly mathematical distraction.    Little player interaction.

You'd think this game would be dry, but it's not. It's always a hit with everyone -- gamers and non-gamers alike. Of course, I have to "emcee" everything very actively to keep things moving along and so the players don't get bogged down and confused by all the fiddly stuff that has to happen.

It's really hard to put my finger on just what it is about this game that makes me always happy to play it.  It's just... cool... 

This would be my #1 pick for the next board game they should release on xbox.

~25 plays

RATING: 8
Wasn't overly impressed by the game.

I understand there are multiple strategies to winning:  do you stay one step behind so you can get the resources cheaper and stockpile money for a hidden strike, do you bully your way through, buying cheaper cities, but getting last pick of the more expensive resources effectively netting the same as your more efficient opponent?

As such, the game has a built in anti-kingmaker policy. 

So why wasn't I impressed?  I certainly don't mind the rubberband effect in a shorter game like YINSH, but fighting for a marginal lead for 2 hours felt like wasted time.  In the end, I felt as though the game was so systematic that it played me...the harder I pushed, the more it pushed me down (and the opposite for my opponent; as long as his bar was to stay one step below me).

In the end, it just felt like I was along for the ride, a victim of the system, and my efforts were moot since I couldn't pull away.

-----
Upping my rating to 8.
Beginning to enjoy the subtelties of the rubber band effect; some turns it's better to jump ahead and be more productive, others you should sit it out and buy all the resources before your opponent.  Each game is completely different as you adapt to available routes.  I played more middle ground than my first time, which led to more strategic options.  You definitely don't know who's going to win until the end.

Power Grid is a fun versatile game.  It has hit the table many times because it plays well with 5 or 6 players.

Great game, because it always brings back those behind by giving them "bonuses". However it has it's flaws.

One of the few games that feels more like work than fun and I like math in games generally.  Never really cared for the way auctions worked in this game either but I'm not the biggest auction fan.

A "standard" resource management game, but I like the theme and the game mechanics.    I have ambivalent feelings about this game.

I need to play more to make a final decision about rating. I really like the mechanics of the market, which imitate a real market surprisingly well. Balance of power station capacity, player order, ability to block/interfere power lines and winning conditions add a variability of strategies.

The game's only con - and I've seen this commented in reviews as well - is that it could, depending on the players, become a math  exercise. Still it probably depends on how serious you take the game.

What a great little game.
First my criticism - The money is a bit cheap and the areas on the board are difficult to distinguish BUT the game play is great. The mechanics are simple and the length (four player varient) is less than 2 hours so can get 2 or 3 games in in an evening. It just flows well with you trying to maximise output for minimal investment whilst avoiding getting pinned in on the board. (In which case it costs more to supply cities) - Good invention.

A decent game, I like the mechanics, they aren't like "wow" though, and I only played with 4, I think more would be better.  Weird the first time I played, something wasn't right with the end game, I got screwed over, consider this a bad playing experience for me.  I'd have to have a good one in return to consider buying it, I think.  I didn't like right about 3 turns before we ended that I knew that I had no chance of winning, even though I was close and could if things worked out differently, but it wasn't at all in my control.

Played twice with the Westchester Gaming group.  I think it's a really good game that has a lot going on; probably the heaviest game I've played (I think it's a lot higher than 3.42, more like 4.42 in my opinion).  As you may have guessed, I didn't really catch on until late in the first game. I was more of a threat in the second game, yet still ended up in last place due to some quicking thinking on the part of another player (who shut me out of nearly all needed resources to power up in the final round!).

This is likely the best game I have ever played. the mechanics are very interesting and being in first place isn't always a good thing. I like the way balance is brought to the game play, keeping even the last player in the running all the way to the end.

Strategy can be used very effectively to give yourself an advantage, but this game is so easy to catch on that non-gamers will enjoy it from the very beginning.

The randomness of plants and playing areas always keeps this game exciting and a real challenge. Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy today!

RATING: 7.5
My opinion of this went down after a few plays.  The balancing mechanisms are way too strong.  And you are not really making a power grid exactly.  That is, you don't connect the plants to the cities.  Should have called it something different, though that may just be an English translation issue.  Still fun, though.  The German map is probably the best.  USA and France are OK, but I think Italy is too narrow.

Power Grid is an awesome and unique game. Using money management as the common thread that ties the elements together, this game manages to intuitively combine a connection building game, an auction game, and a fluctuating resource market that is affected by supply & demand. It is a masterpiece that is more than the sum of its parts.

My one complaint about this game would be that there are a few rules details that are easy to forget and the main rules are not laid out well to serve as a reminder. This is easily remedied by printing up a good rules summary to have on hand. I like this one: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/32681/power-grid-players-aid-set-up-guide

A truly great planning, auction and resource management game that plays well with 2-6 players. The variety of maps and cards adds to the replayability.  Has a slight learning curve, with a good balance of location, capacity, value and planning all being important. Also a clever turn-order catch-up mechanism whereby the leader in cities has the worst position in each round.

Outstanding economic auction and network connection strategy game. As an electrical engineer, I like the theme of buying power plants and supplying cities with energy. Since I am working in a completely different sector, this will probably be as close as I will ever get to the subject of my studies. **** Also try the excellent expansion maps!

RATING: 7.5
The three intertwined mechanisms of this game (bidding for plants, buying resources, and the positional game) and the crucial importance of turn order combine to make it a satisfying challenge.  Though a newbie can skew things, a win is generally well earned in this one.  The go-slow phenomenom in the middle game can be exciting but is sometimes just boring.  The dark and misshapen design scheme gives me the creeps though others seem to like it.  In my view, more fun (though more chaotic) with 5-6, when you can find that many.  Three or four players is more chess-like and unforgiving.  I find playing with two players pretty pointless.

RATING: 8
There is one obvious strategy to be the winner - at the end get last of the game order so you can take the best power plant... and so power the most cities. A pity that such a cool game with really nice mechanics has such an endgame... in most times it does not matter what you reached before, it only matters that you are last in gameorder and take that best power plant... (and that you are located in the middle field throughout the game, but you never need to reach for the lead). But the theme is very interesting and gaming is fun nevertheless, so it's a solid 8.

[size=12][b]Why I like Power Grid:[/b][/size]
+ The route/network building mechanic was implemented better in this game than other games.

- I find the bidding somewhat tedious, especially with 5-6 players to the point where I'd rather play another game.

Lots of strategy but also with an unpredictable power station auction and resource market which adds enough variation. There's a risk of Math getting a bit heavy late on so worth having a calculator handy just in case. Key point to stress: The auction house is the key to the game, if a player is allowed to take a very powerful plant for cheap, they'll easily win.

37,80 English version bought. It is quite possible that i will Buy the german extensions. There is a great price difference.it is said to be a very mathematic game. This i like. but it also means that it can suffer from some slow play.Have testplayed it myself. Based on that I give it 8.5. I believe this rating can only go up. The game seems very unforgiving for slow starters. The mechanisms and turn order are very balanced.If you get behind in three turns it seems likely that this is your own fault because there is no hidden information. Except for the start of phase two (removal of the lowest card with one from the stack)This new information is however for all there to see. And all that this can mean is a serious bidding war.Very high expectations. And not  uncertain about them.

Update :
Best game I have ever played. Seriously thinking about purchasing another copy.

Rewards multiple strategies, adapting to an ever-changing market of power plants and resources, and demands that players think ahead to win.  Great introduction to Euro-style games. Game works best with 3 or more players.  A little more challenging to teach to newcomers, but certainly not impossible.

Fantastic game that rewards multiple strategies and adapting to change. Downsides are that the mechanics don't work as well with 2 players and certain areas of the board a very unbalanced, making startup costs for one player much more expensive unnecessarily.

PG gets a perfect score based simply on sheer pleasure of playing it, being able to understand it the first time around (despite it's complexity), and the continued genius of FF's games. If you love Cataan you will PROBABLY love this--if you hate Cataan, you WILL hate this. Takes resource management into a different light. And who would have thought that a game about energy and smog stacks could be fun? High score simply for the guts to tackle a rather drab subject matter.

Increasing my rating after 400+ games.  You can start to see tons of subtle things going on after you get past your first 100 games or so.

Having said that, it can't be a "10" for me.  Every few games, the winner is determined solely by favorable or unfavorable plant drops.

Currently, my favorite map is Baden.  I like the "discard the two lowest plants if everyone passes on a plant" rule and that the turn order determination is done after the plant auction every round.

A good, solid game. The mechanics are excellent, and the suppy/demand resource track is amazingly simple but effective.

One caveat is that the game gets more interesting with more players, as auctions and player order get more involved; however, with more players, the game definitely gets longer, and with all the adding involved in making your move, sometimes this can make the game drag.

Solid dry euro with lot of math. I don't mind these things but unfortunately the auction system didn't work well with 2 players. Also, I'm not a big fan of paper money and muddy coloured game board (with unnecessarily big pipes to make it even more ugly).

The game is full of complex interactions among the many phases.  The wide variety of game mechanisms provides for a lot of tinkering and planning, but the game still seems relatively approachable for new players.  The balancing mechanisms are very helpful for maintaining a tense, close game.

We have bumped into some kingmaking situations, because of the victory conditions.  Sometimes, a player with more money may be limited in his final purchases by the preceding players' moves.  This probably won't be much of a problem in a fair game, but the connection cost distributions may cause some almost arbitrary differentiation at the end of the game.  There can be similar problems with resource shortages and plant availability, depending on the particulars of a given game.

Rating is for new version.  This is one of my favorite games right now.  Unlike many German games, this one does NOT give you a few VPs here and there for doing certain things.  There is a goal that you build up to.  I prefer that sort of victory condition.  Very neat interwoven mechanics.  The key aspect of play centers on buying the right plants for the right price, but the resources and map building play their key roles too.  Wonderful balance and scales well for any number of players.  Great game to play online at BSW since the program takes care of the tedious bookkeeping.

This is a great game - it's classic! Full of interesting choices to make and quite "tough" experience. You really don't want to be in the leading position (or you should know what you're doing).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The object of Power Grid is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network gains a predetermined size. In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they use to power their cities.However, as plants are purchased, newer, more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing, you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials (coal, oil, garbage, and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the 'renewable' windfarm/ solar plants, which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.

If you don't smell smoke, then you're not playing the game right! This is not your typical light-n-fluffy Euro game. It requires serious concentration (can you say planning ahead?) and the ability to perform numerous arithmetic computations mentally. Don't get me wrong these features are not a put off for this game, in fact, they add to the flavor of this game (and considerably so!). Also, don't think that all you need to know is math to do well in this game; that is but one aspect of this 'must have' classic. With power plant auctions reminiscent of Princes of Florence, market-based raw material procurement (with the ability to deny your opponents the resources they require), and turn-order positioning adding to the strategy required to play this game, it's no wonder this game is rated so highly! Without a doubt, Power Grid is one of the heavier (non-wargame) Euro-style games currently available. If you like thinking during your games, then this game will charge you right up! [Bad pun intended.]

Extremely dry auction and wall-building game. Surprisingly luck-driven as the power plants that appear are so random, it makes planning for the future very difficult.

This is a fairly good game... though I must admit it suffers from the "I feel like I'm doing homework" problem that some other Eurogames suffer from.  By that, I mean that there are points in the game where I am not having "fun"...  instead I feel like I'm just running the numbers...  and probabilities in my head.

That's fine when it happens here and there, but not so much when it happens a lot.  That said, I have had "good" games of Powergrid...  so it doesn't happen every time.

Several plays.  I've recently had to lower my rating of this game.  The last several games have simply not been fun.  They've been long, laborious affairs, that I quickly grew boring and exhausting.  The game is good - I'm just not enjoying it anymore.

Euro with interaction without being mean. The combination of building, auction and resource management on a tight budget is awsome. We have some many plays of this before I started logging it. So I am a little tired of the game, but it is still very good.

Although the theme of this game might lack the sparkle, the flow of the game is really enjoyable. The mechanics are simple enough that almost everybody can quickly get the idea of the game. There is enough interaction between the players and downtime is negligible. There are also a lot of different maps available with special rules, so the game won't easily turn boring.

Best played with 4-6 players. 
Takes about 30 mins per player. 
Basic math skills required.

Awesome strategic game, in which every decision you make has very deep consequences in your future moves. Economic micromanagement at it's best. The auction mechanism to buy new centrals is very amusing and every map has different rules that can put a nice twist on the usual gameplay.

RATING: 9.5
This is an interesing game because there is quite a bit of strategy but you don't need to implement/understand all of it to play and have a good time playing.  The conceptual proximity to monopoly and other money based games also makes it more approchable...  It's a nice stepping stone towards more complex stuff.  The rules are simple and the whole thing is quite accessible despite the depth.

OK, first I hate auction games, so that might be a reason I don't like it much. Evaluating the value of a plant is always hard to define for me. Second, I know that managing your money is one of the part of the game. I think it was a bit annoying but it was tolerable. Third, I find the board useless. It's not like if having a specific geographical position had any importance and it's not also like if you could easily block other players. Or if you can block them, it's just no big deal. So I was a bit feeling like playing solitaire multiplayer even if there are some influence between players, for the market and the auction.

Funkenschlag is one of my favorites (see comments therewith) and so I love Power Grid almost just as much.  Power Grid, has some rules differences, making the game faster:  (1) with an accelerated & generous income production chart, and (2) changes the tactical connection drawing map to a fixed cost map.  I like both games as they are different enough in strategy but I think I just slightly prefer the original, 1st edition Funkenschlag for game balance.  With Power Grid, it's mostly about gaining the best plants to power the most after someone hits the endgame factor.  In Power Grid, if you don't pay attention, someone could very likely win it abruptly or runaway with the generous income payouts.

LIKES:

* expandability with the numerous maps and power plant decks make this game slightly different depending on the map (but not nearly as different in most cases as many Age of Steam maps).
* Game is easily explained and follows a few easy steps.  Playing well may not be so easy, but gameplay is straightforward.
* This game is all about timing - when to go for big power plants, when to go from slumming and charge to the front.  Wait too long and you lose; jump the gun and you lose.

DISLIKES:

* As much as it can be a strength, the game play is also quite repetitive and the downtime can get quite annoying, particularly as people are trying to add the costs for buying into cities, buying resources, and buying power plants.  Make a misstep with your money, and your game could be lost.
* Early expansions didn't add much to the game.  The last few have been better in making the game a different experience.

===========================

I find the fun factor low in this game although I'm not sure why.  Perhaps I view it as a simple game masquerading as a complex game?  All the negatives of a complex game with few of the benefits?  Not sure but I find myself grading this one lower over time as it has gone from a 9 to a 7 and I rarely look forward to playing and now I've sold my copy and am finished with the game - rating it a 5.

A tábla elég szép, a szabályok pedig nem túl bonyolultak: már az első játék is élvezhető ha akad aki ügyesen el tudja magyarázni a lényeget. A játékban a fizetőeszköz gyakorlatilag írólapra nyomtatott papírpénz, ami roppant sérülékenynek tűnik, ez nem tetszett.
A játék témája nem fogott meg (erőműveket vásárolni és hozzájuk fűtőelemeket, majd a megtermelt árammal ellátni a településeket, és beszedni a szolgáltatott áram árát, amiből újabb erőműveket lehet építeni és újabb településeken elkezdeni az áramszolgáltatást). A játékosok cselekedetei elég nagy hatással vannak egymásra, de nem lehetetlenítik el egymás játékát. Megfelelő mennyiségű és nehézségű választási lehetőség elé állítja a soron lévő játékost: nem egyértelmű, hogy mikor épp mi lenne a leghelyesebb lépés (azaz a játékos nem csak statiszta szerepet tölt be), de nem is kell perceken keresztül gondolkozni a kiválasztásán (azaz nem várakoztatja sokáig a többi játékost). A kelleténél szerintem többet kell benne számolgatni.
Nem tetszik benne, hogy a játéktáblán az ország bizonyos megyéit le kell takarni ha nem maximális számú játékos játssza. Folyton megtévesztett, mert a piacon lévő erőmű-lapokkal takartuk le a nem használt térképrészleteket, ami nem tökéletesen takar és emiatt többször is olyan városokon kezdtem el gondolkozni, amik épp nincsenek is játékban, valamint zavaró az is, hogy az erőművek alatt egy zsúfolt térkép van háttérként.

Szóval így elsőre: könnyen elsajátítható kiegyensúlyozott játék kicsit száraz témával és sok számolgatással.

An interesting take on Monopoly. The game is just a little bit too "mathy" for me.  I don't enjoy constantly doing figures in my head to figure out every move I should make in a turn.  The artwork is pretty good, but I just can't bring myself to actually buying this game, or even wanting a copy for myself. I have other games that takes this much time, or less, and I get the same feeling from them.

Several plays on BSW.  Had me remarking on how clever some of its facets were.  The varying power plants and auction system -- clever!  The turn order mechanism -- clever!  The raw materials economy simulation -- very clever!  

But clever isn't enough to make me like a game.  This left me cold.  I saw the room for tactical maneuvering, the dependency on watching your opponents.  But I didn't see any room for risky, creative play, any DRAMA to the game.  It's rather procedural and bordering on dull, if you ask me.  There are many other games I'd rather play.

RATING: 6
Interesting subject as a game.  The game is a simple business game in that one acts as a power giant looking for expansion across U.S. (or any other continent) the power network, bringing light to the cities while collecting revenues.  

There are a lot of good ideas integrated in the game and they generally working very well with one another.  For example, building a power plant cost you a sums of money but it is a fixed amount across all different cities and you can only build a maximum one power plant in a city.  So you have to expand to the neigbouring cities.  Other latecomer to the city can build the second and the third power plant at an incrementally higher cost.  

There are different power plants to choose from, mainly they vary in the type and amount of resources used to generate power and the no. of cities that could be served by a single plant.  In turn, you can only serve the cities that you have a power plant in.  Hence, rapid purchase in the power plants doesn't guarantee you big profit and you have to purchase power plants in cities to catch up.  You can only have a maximum of 3 power plants and so you have to gradually replace the old one with the more efficient one.  Every power plant in the market is up for sale in an auction after a player declare his interest in a plant.  People would bid for it according to his strategy in future development.  People would generally pay more for more efficient power plant.      

There are 4 types of resources to generate power; namely coal, oil, garbage and uranium.  I quite like the mini system on the economy where supply and demand of resources would change the cost of each unit of resources.  There are limited supplies of resources in the market.  In one 3-player game, many players go for the same resources and therefore resource prices go up as the restock of each type of resources according to a constant rate grows relatively slower than the demand.  

Cities are connected with transit costs.  You can only expand your power network to the adjacent cites with a connection.  The first place you decide to build your power plant upon is therefore important as you naturlaly would like to expand to the surrounding cities with the least costs.  for example, cities in the east coast of U.S. are generally less expensive to connect while it cost you a huge fortune to connect the west from the east across the central part of U.S.     

To balance the game, the leader in a turn is the first one to pick up the plant for purchase but the last one to purchase resources from the market.  To win the game, a player who powered the most cities in his entire network in the end turn with sufficient resources.  If the power plant is not working due to no resources, the no. of cities by that plant doesn't count.

Overall, I generally like the game.  It is not as abstract as many other Euro-type games whereas it is realsitic to a certain extent.  It is also a competitive game when people begin to cross to other player's sphere of influence.  The game can be completed quite quickly and is easy to teach to kids. The game is not meant to be an exhaustive business simulation and so serious gamers might still hungry for more.  For example, the game focuses more on the supply side of the economics and the market demand side of electricity is not modelled.  Demand for electricity in each city is constant.  But then, that could be another game Power Grid 2.0.

I like Power Grid a lot. The game just flows with the steps of each turn feeling so connected. The whole mechanism that ties the game together feels like a well oiled machine. From the first round of bidding to the last round of taking resources.

Power Grid is good. It's almost a 9, except it's so 'mathy' that I couldn't play it all the time, and I may turn down a game of it from time to time.

A great game, I've played it and enjoyed it a lot, my friends and I discussed great tactics to save money on resources, one of my friends all the time bought low and then changed his power plants whenever needed, I didn't had that much vision! A must for Europlayers as well as for Economics students... It only reached an 8 for an Ameritrasher avid for deeper player interaction

Edit: Changed the rating to 9, I underestimated the "player interaction" but you can seriously injure your opponent's progress by blocking their rutes, they will have to wait until next step and even then they'll have to pay even more. The economic deepness amuzes me...

This is was one of the first games I saw the rules for on [url=http://www.boardgameswithscott.com/?p=35]Board Games with Scott[/url]. To be fair, this episode did not impress me very much. The game seemed dry, fiddly, and more complicated than it needed to be. Needless to say, the game was not on my radar.

Move to a few months later when a gaming buddy brings over Power Grid. Well, I will try anything at least once. The game moved slowly because we had to reference the rules often, but I found it interesting regardless. Although Power Grid is basically a network connection game, the dryness did not bother me. The game is fiddly, but we found ways to deal with this issue, which also helped remember some of the more obscure rules. Also, I won which helped me to like the game!

After playing a second time, here is what I have learned:
-- Initial placement is very important to expand quickly and build up monies for your infrastructure. 
-- Along with initial placement, initial expansion is also important. If you are cut off early, it will be difficult to recover.
-- Put someone in charge of the Power Plant auctions. It is too much for the game explainer to run everything. This is an easy way to get the others involved. Further, they can remember the oddities of the auctions (i.e., removing high/low power plants) freeing you up for other rule issues.
-- Put someone else in charge of money for many of the same reasons as above. Actually, we just put the money in reach of everyone to do their own banking.
-- Turn order is important.
-- Money is the tie-breaker. Some people think the game is broken because too many games end in initial ties. I think the money tie-breaker works well as you have to plan for it the entire game.

The game is actually relatively easy to learn despite all the mechanics going on. My only concern right now is about initial placement. This aspect is so important that I worry it will dictate who the winner will be.

Final thought. Bring a calculator. You will probably need it.

RATING: 10
Very intensive game involving simple math, complex networking and strategy, and understanding your opponent's strategies as you play against them more often.  This was my first board game after Catan and I was amazed at the gameplay and resource system.  I love how everyone can go from buying minimum resources and letting the market cheapen to crashing the market in one fell swoop.

I find almost every match -win or lose- a rewarding experience.  I can usually pinpoint the exact turn I screwed up and try to make a note in the future. I also love how often our games have ended where the winner is decided by $4 or less

A couple of gripes: the game becomes less stragetic with 3 players as everyone can build on every city. Even with the slingshotting, I've rarely played a game where the last place person in stage 2 comes out victorious.  It usually takes the combined effort of each opponent to bring down the leader to 2nd place. It is a very laborious game, after two matches we rarely have the willpower to play another.

These are minor and finicky.  I feel the auctioning, the resource market, the strategic play order; it all makes for a very enjoyable 1.5 hours.

Power Grid still sat on the shelf for a long time due to its poor 2-player reputation.  At some point, we looked into getting [thing=108667][/thing], since it seemed like that might make the game better for two players.  However, what finally pushed us over the edge were the revamped two player rules found in [thing=155873][/thing] ([b][url=http://riograndegames.com/Game/1282-Power-Grid-Deluxe]Rulebook[/url][/b]), which we just took and used with our regular copy.  These rules set up "The Trust", essentially a streamlined dummy or robot player.  What was nice, though, was that rules and maintenance for The Trust were very straightforward, so we finally gave it a shot.

Besides the poor two-player reputation, there were a few other hurdles we had to get through first.  For being a classic Euro game, the rulebook was very confusing (and it's not a surprise that there are so  many questions on the forums here).  Even once we had an idea of the gameplay, for a streamlined Euro game, there were a lot of fiddly rules that had us constantly checking the rulebook (how many resources should you restock when, how much money should you get, when to take or not take cards from the power plant deck, etc.)  I was also a little worried that it might be similar to the Crayon-rails games, and we really did not like [thing=168][/thing].  One of the foreboding aspects was that it did seem like you were doing the same things over and over again (buy power plants, buy resources, buy cities, get income, rinse and repeat).  Would it stay interesting?

Despite all that...we actually really liked it!  Even as a two-player game!  The Trust really does simulate competition for the power plant auction, resources, and especially the board networking in a very easy way with little upkeep.  At first, the power plant auction, the resources, and the city networking felt like separate processes, but quickly we found they all intersected with money driving the engine.  Figuring out the optimal point on the curve between all three is a challenge, particularly while at the same time gauging what the other players are doing.  The end game and winning conditions are a little weird, so the first half of the game feels like a prolonged setup to maneuver your actions last few turns, but we remained engaged throughout.  It was after our first game that my wife's eyes lit up---she had managed to build into enough cities to trigger the ending and thought she was in for an easy win, but I was able to (with the help of The Trust) buy up all the resources to prevent her from actually running her power plants!  The possibilities and consequences of your actions reverberate through the entire game.  It really tapped into our fondness for building and optimization games.

That being said, we've since tried this as a five player game with a few friends, and it was amazing.  You can see how the different economic engines converge and how the actions of the different players really drive how everything plays out.   Yes, with more players, the interactions between the players dramatically increases and it's far better than with just two.  On face value, the economic engines look fairly straightforward, but the human element is fantastic---the amount of interaction in [thing=2651][/thing] is almost a complete shift from the multiplayer solitaire aspect of more recent designs (e.g., Feld games).  Initially, we were worried that just going through the same set of actions over and over again would get boring, but we felt engaged the whole time [i]because[/i] of the human interaction, with each player trying to manipulate the game state (not only the auctions, resource market, and territories, but also things like turn order).  I suppose [thing=2651][/thing] really is a classic for a reason.  

Still, even with two, it's not so bad and it's something that my wife and I have played when it's just the two of us.  So far, we've stuck with using the rules for The Trust, but as we become better at the game, we'll give [thing=108667][/thing] a try---we have a copy, but the rulebook (again) seems very confusing.  Maybe it's just the language that we're not getting.  One advantage with The Trust is how easy it is and how fast it goes (you really don't have to deal with exchanging any money or bidding with The Trust), so even for now we've been pretty happy.

This is a awesome game ... one of the best I've ever played. The way the market for resources works is so very inspired and is alone responsible for a lot of strategic thinking.

Definiteley a good game.  Not one I would teach to my game night though, because it really requires a lot of math.  All the math is simple addition and subtraction, but when you have to do it 20 times a turn...yeah.  A little too much analysis-paralysis going on for this to be a favorite for me.  I think I see how I can play the game without having too much AP, but it's just really hard to not, because...you want to win.  

Still enjoyed this game overall.

This game feels like a collection of solitaire games clumsily hacked together into an atrocious kludge.  The only real interaction with other players comes when bidding.  The scarcity in the commodities market is itself scarce.  The game seems largely determined by the randomness of the power plants showing up, and this means the strategy of the game is to sit in last place so you have the best shot at getting one.  The game could probably be fixed if the prices for commodities and earnings from powering cities were both raised, but that would take some play testing, and probably wouldn't eliminate the solitaire feel of the game.

PG is played a lot in our group. It is a good game but I just find it hard to believe it sits at #4 overall. Maybe I would enjoy its older German sibling that involved drawing in the transmission. Maybe its because I have worked in the industry... Whatever the reason that's my sense of it.

There are positional mechanics - last buying first etc. that are fine but random arrival of technologies, non-marginal priced fuel purchases and transmission that is the same cost regardless (though the latter ameliorated to a degree by 2nd and 3rd place buy ins).

Power Grid is one of those rare games where everyone's in it until nearly the end.  In a sense it's like a marathon - start out too fast, and you'll end up collapsing into a water stand at mile 20.

Have played many times and loving it. Surprisingly easy to learn, teach and play, and is brilliant as a gateway game. Must be played carefully by all, since the ending condition is generally triggered during a "blitz move". If you like economic resource-management games, this one is arguably king of the hill. Single annoyance is the confusing and completely over-the-top map art/graphics.

Good to play this excellent game - probably unlikely to buy as it would seem to require at least 4 (and usually more) to get full value from it.  Also quite a bit of maths on the hop required and not sure whether my wife would like it so much.  Second game felt a bit samey to me - a race really.
Some cool ideas (eg. the demand/supply /pricing of the resources).  Like all the varied powerplants, but the objective and the basic ways to achieve it doesn't really seem to change.

Preferred the France map to the US one, although Paris is a bit unfair as the 1st person can grab 3 easy stations.

RATING: 7
Strategy-rich, with few random elements, I can definitely see why it's rated highly here. However, its two-player is poor, and it can be a bit dry and tedious at times. Rules complexity is nothing terrible, but a thorough read is necessary, including the Exceptions and Changes section at the back (elements of which are required for setup but not mentioned in that section).

I was put off from this game initially because I thought that there will be a lot of calculations involved. But after playing it, Power Grid is actually a simple game with an element of bidding involved.

I love the theme, the resource management mechanism, and the board and tokens are fun to use. The dynamic *should* be intuitive and smooth flowing, but even on our 5-6th play, it progresses painfully slowly, since we are always thinking and rethinking who is going first for which action, and why. Also, all the niggly number juggling for maximum strategizing makes it a bit too carry-the-one for me to really enjoy play. Even the rate at which resources are renewed for each turn is impossible to memorize because it changes from phase to phase and depending on the number of players. We consult the charts in the rules about every 2-5 minutes in this game, which slows it down and gets in the way of the flow. Maybe I'll enjoy the next game more if I play it with a calculator and notepad.

RATING: 4
Played only on BSW.  I decided to downgrade to a 7 from an 8 for the time being because I just don't feel myself drawn to play the game, even though it is very good and I enjoy it when I play.  Some of it is that the game suffers from an awkward dilemma.  The game doesn't really start to get interesting (for me) until you play with 4 players, which creates the possibility of being completely locked out of a city, but with that many players or more I begin to find the downtime a little annoying.

UPDATE: I've dropped this to a 6.  The downtime is too annoying, and the interesting decisions just aren't frequent enough.  This feels like a one hour game that runs much too long (note, it plays faster on BSW, but to be of more use, I'm putting my comments in FtF terms).  I'm sure I haven't plumbed the full depths of the strategy and tactics of this game, but I don't feel drawn enough to go deeper.

UPDATE: Dropped another 2 points. I never feel a pull to play PG any more, and often try to wriggle out of it when others suggest it.

It just bores me.

RATING: 9
While this game is very number-crunchy, it combines Euro-quality mechanics with a large amount of interaction and a unique theme I highly enjoy (energy). 

This is through the value that you should bid for each power plant varying drastically depending on the current game situation, shrewd money/resource management (while my first 10 games I rarely saw resources go above cost 4, I have learned better, and now I've played games where people were unable to win because all the coal or trash were bought), and the person in "last place" getting better turn order placement preventing a runaway leader while leading to some interesting situations where you you don't want to build up to max capacity.

Blocking off people to claim a territory for yourself and jacking up the prices of resources are the main methods of interaction. However, I like that while you can definitely hinder someone greatly, it rarely occurs that you can screw someone over so badly that they are basically out of the game.

As I said I love the energy theme and I think it is implemented quite well. My only gripe is I feel like some of the renewable plants are quite under powered.

The US board is by no means regionally balanced (East coast of the US has much cheaper connections); however this does not mean the game as a whole is unbalanced, as you can face less competition if you start closer to the west, and I wonder if it was intentional (you can also have a slightly shorter game by choosing only regions with low connection costs).

I think this game is best with 3-5 (yes everyone can build on every city with 3, but by that point the game is almost over anyways). 2 players makes Step 2 a bit anticlimactic and devolves the auction mechanic, and 6 players works but is a little bit unwieldy.

Comments entered on 10 Feb 2010:

Power Grid has a fantastic mix of building connections, creating infrastructure, and managing limited resources. The number of official map expansions provide a lot of different puzzles to figure out.

There have been several games that I have played now where more than one person has achieved the number of cities required to end the game, both are able to power them up, and the game is decided by the remaining cash on hand.

I have purchased the base game as well as the France/Italy, Benelux/Central Europe, and China/Korea maps. I have not yet purchased the newest map release of Brazil/Spain & Portugal. I also purchased the Power Plant 2 deck.

I’ve played many runs of this game, and without fail, I have been able to predict the winner after the first turn. So much of the game is based on those first 1-3 turns and dramatically impacts how quickly someone can rev up. I do *really* like the resource auction mechanism though, so my last few games have been spent more playing the resource market than anything else. I wish you could sell resources back during that phase. I might house rule it sometime and see if I like the game more.

Superb game of economic and effeciency. Played with 3 and 5. With 3 it was too easy to connect verything, with 5 it was to hard. I guess the sweet spot of gameplay/playing time and pleasure must be 4. The game is heavy on artihmetic which some people might find dry/boring.

An economic game.  The power plant auction is fun, which pits your needs for power generation and supply of available cash against your opponents'.  I also like the supply and demand of the fluctuating resource market--this is where Power Grid is sheer brilliance.  The importance of turn-order makes for some interesting decisions.  I am not particularly good at this game, but that's ok.   Does not work at all for only two players, contrary to the recommendation on the box [2-6].  But this makes for a good and tense economic game with 4 or 5 players.  Comparable in feel to other economic games like "Steam."   Do Not Forget the "often forgotten" rules carefully pointed out at the end of the rules, particularly the four conditions whereby you must remove a plant from the auction block.

Pretty friggin' marvelous.  Hard to imagine a better fusion of mechanics that don't necessarily go together.  Ready to call it the best auction game, period, and that's on top of having cool area control and market manipulation stuff going on.  Challenging choices, constant player interaction, frequent reassessments of who's really ahead... I'm engaged all the time, and almost never feel like I'm out of it, even if I might be.  Yes, the last turn is a grinding math-fest; I can live with that.  But the game has tension, it has ebb and flow, it has a lovely balance of strategy and tactics.  All that might make it a 9.  But for me, it's the truly distinct, ugly-on-purpose aesthetics that seal the deal, complete the package, and put it over the top.

Nice components.  Seats 3,4 and 5 players quite comfortably, gets pretty darn cramped with 6 players though.  Otherwise, the game scales very well.  A lot of thought has been put into varying the set-up per the number of players, and per each map (I own the expansion, so have played on the US, Germany and France maps so far... have yet as of 5/2006 to play on the Italy map, which looks brutal).This game is an easy enough game to play if you want to stay in the running and not fall miserably behind, but is a very, very difficult game to win.  Comments such as "my brain hurts" and "but do I want to do that?" and "it's more complicated than I thought" can be heard around the table.  At the same time, the auctions are a lot of fun, and so is watching your network grow.  

One thing is for sure... download and use some of the player aids here on the Geek.  I found the "restocking templates" to be particularly useful.

A great economic game where you need to carefully balance your power plant capacity, cost of inputs, and expansion of your network.  The game is very well designed and if you like economic games, you will love Power Grid.  The game can be "mathy" but that is part of the appeal of many economic games.  It does seem like you are the CFO of a power company trying to determine how best to invest your resources to optimize your network.  The game is a reasonable 30 minutes per player.  It may be a little too complicated for children under 12 but definitely good for older kids.

A huge hit from the start.  The theme was intriguing.  Even so, it has worn on me after a few plays.  BSW pretty much ruined it for me actually.  The board seems like kind of an afterthought even though by appearances it should be a more integrally involved part of the game.  I don't really like the victory condition.  The luck of the draw of power plants seems too important for a game that takes this long to play.  I'd rather play a more streamlined auction game for the most part, say Ra or Modern Art.

I can see why a lot of people like this one, especially the hardcore gamers.  Math computations galore.  The major thing I like about this game is that I feel in control every time I play it.  This is a big contrast to St. Petersburg (the one other game our gaming group likes a lot).  The only reason I won't rate Power Grid higher is because I will never be able to play it with my "less hardcore" relatives.  So while this is a great game, it certainly isn't for everyone.

After a few more plays, the rating has gone up one more, I love this game.

RATING: 9
Power Grid is up there as one of my favorites. The auctioning and resource market mechanics are fabulous. The resource market is such a fantastic part of the game and probably my favorite part. Everything changes based on what other players are buying at the auction and what power plants pop up first. Great game, highly recommended.

Even with its clever way of keeping the players generally in the same range by making the leader go last in the important phases certain circumstances can give someone a runaway victory. Those circumstances are usually brought on by the other players though not by any form of luck. Otherwise the game stays tight and it will come down to the last round.

This is my first rating conflict. I hate this game with a burning passion but I recognize that it is a well-designed game with solid mechanics. I just find it to be long, dry and overly taxing with extreme downtime while you wait for someone else to figure out what they want to do. AND THEN when you get to the point where you realize how far behind you are, it's too late and you have another hour and a half of "playing" until you are finally free of this affliction.

This is evil... after replaying my last game in my head, I find myself wanting to play just one more game.

Only loosers use calculators ;-)

There may be issues with the last turn. Some players are very surprised, when they suddenly loose miserably because the market is one coal short - the game puts very high (too high) demands on players planning in the last couple of turns.

It' bordering on a 8, but I don't really suggest it myself any more, given the strong competition at the top.

The best replacement for Monopoly.  Takes about the same amount of time, maybe less, but is so much more balanced, you are able to come back from being in a bad place, there's no dice determining what and where you can go/get, and even interactions with other players is balanced nicely and not much more than an inconvenience that you can work around with just a little more cash.  I never felt slighted by the game, nor completely out of the race because of either my bad decisions or luck, and the player's in last place are always given the advantage at every step.

Abigail owns it, so I'll never need to. Plus, First Sparks.

RATING: 10
Outstanding game with excellent mechanism! Leaves a strong desire to play it a lot more often. Every turn feels like a tightrope act... don't go too far! And for those who have fallen down/behind there is a built-in safety net (catch-up mechanism = turn order). I love the different ways it has been played during our sessions. This game is a big hit!

Attention: It needs a few games to get all the details and Power Grid can easily exceed two hours playing time. Not recommended for family gaming.

A deep auction/network building game with a gritty theme - different in a nice way. It feels a bit like the middle of the game is played on autopilot, with the key decisions made at the start, and the most fretting done at the end - but this could just be the opinion of a newbie. Poorly written rules meant we played this several times before we had everything right.

Real Masterpiece; easy rules and extremely challenging gameplay make it perfect for gamers but even to introduce someone to boardgames, if they are smart people.
8 instead of 9 just because it's very long and it can be repetitive in the first turns, before it starts the brain burning part (calculator needed, sometimes!) 
If you play with just 2, I reccommend the robot expansions because of the fewer interaction.

RATING: 6
(Math Trade: Got it for [boardgame=55427][/boardgame] in [geeklist=99364][/geeklist], 2012-01-26)

Solid game where players must deal with buying power plants, buying resources, and buying new city connections. The trick is to know when to do each of them to position yourself for the turn orders for buying at the right time. The game seems to drag a bit in Step 1, and picks up a lot in step 2. It also isn't as diversified as many other great games, so could be repetitive.

I had the first edition of that one, but when I tried out the update I knew that I needed it. I think this is Friedemanns homage to the 18xx style games. Very clever bidding and resource management game, with lots of depth and high replay  value. The second edition got rid of lots of ballast and made the game so much more pretty (for a economics game that is ...).

Update: downgraded to a 6. With equally skilled players the game is too much dependent on luck of draw in the plants pile.

Really like this game. Love the auction mechanic and the resource supply/demand is wonderful. 

Even though measures are put in place to prevent a runaway leader, it seems like usually 1 or 2 players pull ahead and it can be difficult to catch them. The early game is important for keeping up and giving yourself a chance to win. Even if you play poorly at the beginning you usually feel successful and are having a good time as long as you're powering a few buildings and making money. Plus you're still somewhat powerful in the auction, even if you're behind. Of course, this can lead to some kingmaking once you realize you're losing.

蠻像是複雜版的Ticket to Ride
除了建築路線之外，另外還加上要有足夠的資源才能產生電力
這樣的變化性會更加提高一些，挺適合長時間遊玩的中度策略遊戲

不過初次遊玩會對於發電廠的價值錯誤評估，可能玩過一輪之後才會比較知道該張卡片的價值，進而在競標的時候調整出價

另外遊戲的計分方式有點太單調就是，單純最後一回合的發電力，感覺可以增加其他的策略性任務，整區佔領加分等等，不然會淪為Greedy去進行遊戲，沒有長期規劃
而且遊戲過程中會發現蠻偏向滾雪球，發展好的人拿到更多資源蓋更多東西，但是卻沒有其他可以逆轉或是牽制的動作可以進行(大概只有競標的時候可以去針對領先者)

I love Power Grid! The auction system and resource management components are awesome. We spend far too much time in each play of this game, but it is really enjoyable. 

I like to teach this to people who have played Ticket To Ride but are looking for something more. While it is very different, it has the same connections kind of idea but without the having to fulfill a series on a card that you drew. Add in buying plants and resources, and you've got a really great strategy game.

I have picked up an expansion map, the Robots and the new card deck. We'll see how much depth that adds to the game.

I don't think that we have played enough to really have a perfect strategy figured out for the base game - this keeps us wanting to play more so that we can work on maximizing our potential.

It is boring. If You like the game with a lot of math (21+15+18+15 or maybe 14+20+13+18 or maybe ...) that takes two hours of play, pls take it.

Too long, not much fun and graphically, this game is disaster.

Good planning and resource management game, I'm even getting used to the turn order rules - although I still feel that to play this game well you have to play the turn order rules well, and that feels a bit unnatural.

Power Grid is a mixed bag. 

On the one hand, it is beautiful; it's a really well designed game that manages to be both on the heavier side while managing a pretty good pacing with an experienced crowd. The different phases are well balanced and you'll be making meaningful choices the whole way. On it's best day, it manages to be dynamic and fun,. You're walking a thin line, however, since bad decisions made early can seriously impair your ability to compete on the long run. This, of course, might lead to crippling player paralysis. 

On the other hand, Power Grid's biggest flaw, in my honest opinion, is math centrism. It a cold and calculating world at there (at least before you put the power on). You don't play Power Grid as much as you calculate it, which reduce player interaction to near zero as everyone is silently counting while wishing for a TI-85. It's kind of the reverse party game, as people find themselves heavily isolated and focusing on their own calculations. Don't expect to enjoy company as much as the cold reality of an energy magnate.

I have all the maps for the game. I generally do not play games with an auction mechanic, but for some reason it works for me in this game.

I may not do very well with this game but I really like it and I always seem to bring it to game night to play.

This is the only game I will always bring with to game night.

This game has some deceptive qualities.
It has a bit more luck than it lets on, but it also has more strategy being cutthroat than it lets on. At least at first. I have a degree and professional experience in this exact field and I must admit this game is a decent little simulation (and a great teaching tool) with great potential for expandsion and further detailing.

Clever bidding and scoring points with your breaks on. That is what you need to do to win this game. 
The theme makes this game unique, and the nicely balanced game mechanisms make this game fun. Players that get behind can recover during the game, because they get lots of advantages. That makes that the winner is only known at the end of the game and keeps the game exciting till the very last round. 

Minus: 1 (not interesting with 2) - 3 (duration)

Solid economic game, but you need to be in the right frame of mind to enjoy it. The auction is the best part and encourages lots of player interaction. The challenge is figuring out when to expand and when to bank resources to power your cities. It can end rather abruptly, which adds to the tension. Sometimes it can feel more like a math problem than a game, but that's more the genre than game design.

RATING: 7
There are so many things about this game that I really like (the theme, the clever market) but it suffers from two serious problems.  1. Almost invariably somebody gets hosed (by getting trapped) due to the constrictive limits that are part of each stage.  2. (and far more serious) the endgame is very mechanical/mathematical and just not a whole lot of fun.  Fun, after all, is what this is all about.

A great Euro-game that combines elements of auction and economic supply and demand mechanics.  Perhaps the best feature is the constantly changing turn-order, which forces players to evaluate carefully how quickly they expand their power empire - least they end up having to pay premium prices for the raw materials necessary to run their power plants.  The multi-step round process also helps ensure that all players stay engaged and cuts back on the likelihood of that 'one player who takes forever' killing the game's momentum.

RATING: 7
Can be quite thinky.  If you you want to make the very most optimal moves you can there is actually quite a bit of information in front of you, but you gotta crunch some numbers... consider your current amount of cash, how much resources are and will be, how much money you will make in the next phase, etc. etc. etc..

If you're set on doing the best you can possibly do, there is no escaping it.  I find myself not wanting it to be so prone to analysis, but then analyzing anyway because I want to compete.

I do like it though... just not one of my favorites.

RATING: 4
The new version makes that game play more smoothly and is quite enjoyable.  A four player game (with one new player and three that had played the old version once or twice) took just over two hours.  Much better.  The power grid version components are very nice.

The only thing that really bugs me about the game is when the power plant queue bogs down and/or the game is thrown out of whack by a plant coming out at just the right time to provide a major advantage for one player.  

My opinion has diminished over time because I've played in several games where the flow of the power plants has lead to an anti-climactic step 2 end game.

Some people despise the turn order shenanigans this game engenders, but those people are missing the point.  That game of musical chairs is not an unintended consequence of this game, but rather a deliberate design choice to give the players pause when it comes to how they approach each round.  The game wants to punish those ahead, and help those behind.  A good player makes sure they are helped when they are not actually behind, and the only ones punished as those not already ahead.

Update: lowered from 9 to 7 
This one is starting to get old. There is something wrong with the end game, not sure if it is the fact that it can come down to a bad flip of the power plant deck, or if it is that there really is not much suspense. The winner is usually obvious in that experienced player can guesstimate you cash, and if you ahead in what you can power then it doesn't matter anyway.  

It all seems anti-climatic to me at this point.

---------------------------
Currently my top game. I really enjoy all aspects of this game. The auction for the power plants, the building of the network and then the buying of resources to make it all work. 

There is never enough money to do all that you want and player inter-action is high. Great Stuff!

RATING: 10
A very good game that combine bidding, management and building of a network, this game is a mixture of all that.  A good balancing mechanism that encourage the last player to comeback in the game and have acces to the cheapest ressources.

Descriptions of this as math-fussy really turned me off from it, but I've played it a few times and really liked it.  There is some calculating the best move, but you're never overwhelmed with options.  The theme and art are fun and unique.  If it were just a little less fussy, it would have some gateway potential--it's appealing to a broad audience.

RATING: 7
A solid game that manages to be fun and a bit of a crunch at the same time. 

Likes
-No player really can run away with the game in the beginning, allowing for play to stay challenging and competitive until the last round. 
-The auction mechanic can be fun when people are competing for similar power plants.
-There are three distinct "steps" that force players to change strategies as resources shift in their abundance.

Dislikes
-The rules are written terribly, like oh my god why is the rulebook laid out like this.
-The art is a bit bland and repetitive, as everything just looks roughly the same with minor differences.
-The paper money that ships with the game is terrible, this will be the first thing I will need to replace, and at the rate they're deteriorating, the paper money will be useless in about 5-7 playthroughs.
-The game can feel a bit slow at times, as there isn't much to do at points.

RATING: 6
At first I liked this game much. But After several plays it went down. The reasons are:

1. Plant distribution is too random. It has various effects:
i) If good power plant don't come out long in the middle of the game, game play stalls and gets boring.

ii) It is not uncommon that someone can buy good plant cheap by luck, while others fought over a good plant before. Obviously the former gets huge advantage.

iii) In end game, plant draw often determines who is the winner.

In short, when experienced players are there, the winner is determined by luck of plant draw.

2. Game plays are not very different, even if map changes each play. Strangely, map changes don't provide significant and satisfying alterations in game play. Well, random power plants give significant and unsatisfying alterations.

3. With that amount of luck, it would be good to play this lightly. But it is hardly possible. It requires much arithmatical work every turn, and it is a bit too long for a light game.

UPDATE July 2007:
Rating down to 4.5. I don't want to play this again. It just doesn't reward your careful plans and agonizing decisions, because of random power plant.

I have played a few times but dont really see a whole lot of depth to this one. It seems more like an exercise in math class than a real game.

I dunno, maybe another few games will solidify my rating one way or the other.

No idea why, but I avoided this game for a long time. Son gave it to me for Christmas, and about midway through our first game a feeling came over me that hadn't happening in quite awhile.  1830 has been my idea of the perfect game for a long time (even though because of its length it doesn't get played), and I truly miss the days of playing that remarkable game. Power Grid gives me that same feeling.  The mechanics fit together well, the game is tense, thought provoking, and when finished with our first game my son and I both wanted another game. (a little too much math for my wife) Superb game that I can't to introduce to others.

Mi primer juego, a siete ciudades. Le doy un 10. Quedé encantado con el juego; con gusto a poco...ya deseo volver a jugar. 
Es, en ciertos aspectos parecido a construcciones de caminos o líneas férreas, y de bloqueo de puntos en un mapa, como Ticket to Ride, pero con mucha más estrategia, combinada con remate de bienes (bastante sencillo en todo caso), y decisiones de compra de recursos.
Bastante interacción en un juego de 5.
Veremos cómo evoluciona y si mantengo la nota.
Mis comentaristas favoritos de este sitio, y que he puesto en mi lista de "Asesores", GeekBuddy Analysis, le dan a este juego un total de 7.85 puntos, uno de los más altos.
UPDATE: Tras el segundo juego, con 5 jugadores y a 17 ciudades, donde llegué segundo con 16 ciudades proveidas, mantengo la calificación. Estoy esperando jugar de nuevo.
UPDATE:
Los pros del juego:
1.- Muy buena interación entre el tema del mismo, ampliar la red de una Empresa eléctrica (que es a la vez generadora, transmisora y distribuidora) con el mecanismo de juego. Se aparta de la mayoría de los juegos "alemanes".
2.- Interesante interacción en cuanto a que las decisiones de  uno afectan a los demás: al momento de rematar una planta; al momento de comprar los recursos, porque la compra de los demás afecta el precio; al momento de comprar las Distribuidoras en las ciudades, ante un eventual bloqueo; en el orden de juego (el primero es castigado porque paga más caro por los recursos y compra al final las Distribuidoras).
UPDATE: dos nuevos juegos a dos jugadores; excelente nivel de estrategia; el más mínimo error cerca del final, cuesta la partida. Con dos buenos jugadores, el nivel es muy parejo. Sigue en 10 para dos jugadores!
3-1-07: Tras varios juegos más, me está aburriendo toda la burocracia en el trámite. Mucha suma y resta al final; si alguien se ubica mal, puede quedar rezagado y sin chance para el resto del juego. Baja a 7.
--------
ENGLISH
My first game, to 7 cities. I give it a 10. I was charmed with the game; i want more ...i wish to play again as soon as possible.
It is, in certain aspects seemed to constructions of roads or strong lines, and of blockade of points in a map, as Ticket to Ride, but with much more strategy, combined with auctions of goods (quite simple), and decisions of purchase of resources.  
Enough interaction in a game of 5.  
We will see how it evolves and if I maintain the rating.  
My geekbudies gives to this game a total of 7.85 points, one of the highest.  
UPDATE: After the second game, with 5 players and to 17 cities, where I arrived second with 16 supplied cities, I maintain the qualification. I am hoping to play again.  
UPDATE:  
The pros of the game:  
1. - very good interaction among the topic of the same one, to enlarge the net of an electric Company (that is at the same time generating, transmitting & distributing) with the game mechanism. It moves away from most of the German games. 
2. - interesting interaction as for that the decisions of one affect to the other ones: to the moment to finish off a plant; to the moment to buy the resources, because the purchase of the other ones affects the price; to the moment to buy the Distributors in the cities (represented by little houses), before an eventual blockade; in the game order (the first one is punished because more expensive pay for the resources and purchase at the end the Distributors).  
UPDATE: two new games with 2 players; excellent strategy level; the most minimum error near the end, costs the departure. With two good players, the level is very even. Continue in 10 for two players!
UPDATE JANUARY 2007: after many new games played, I think there is too much downtime, AP, specially in the last rounds. If someone is blocked at the begining of the game, it's a very boring situation for the rest of his game, with almost null posibility to come back. 7.

An ellegant artificially balanced strategy with slight advantage of micro-management to macro-management. Maybe you don't feel it, but when it comes to endgame and you still have chance to win, it's all about the puny 30 bucks you have in your pocket that make the difference. Or the 30 you don't have, for that matter...

2-6p, 120m.  Consistently in the top 10 BGG, and rightly so.  This is my favorite of the heavy top-10.

I've only played it twice, and would like to play again.  The first time, we played with 5 or 6 and we were all new, so it was a bit chaotic.  The second time we played with 3, and it went more smoothly--though it still took 2  hours, the action keeps moving and there is no down time.  I would like a player aid to help keep track of some things.  For instance the board is kept language-neutral, which unfortunately makes it almost "information-free."
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Overrated.  Not enough tension or interaction for a heavy game. Game is almost too easy.  I can forgive this in Ticket to Ride, but in a 3 hour game there better be some challenge.  Theme is well-incorporated, but ultimately boring. I would give it another try to see if opinion would change.

One of the more heavy games in my collection. Lots of subtle strategy in fairly simple steps and is somewhat self balancing due to the turn order system and auctions.

The only downside is the large amount of mental math and management involved in the markets (adding new resources and tiles to the board) which can be tedious in a fairly long duration game.

This sat on the shelf for years because I didn't appreciate that the subtlety in gameplay really did make any difference to the outcome.  In actual fact the games is so well balanced, it's probably the most carefully thought out game ever made.

Rating of 9 based on two plays.  This game has easily become my favorite eurogame.  I love the supply and demand aspect of the fuel resources in particular, but all aspects of the game have so far hit the right buttons with me.  While there's no direct confrontation, there's plenty of indirect actions that just verge on direct (buying up resources an opponent needs, bidding up plants, temporarily blocking map areas) that make this game more than simply a race to the finish as in so many other eurogames.

I think this might be my favorite Euro -- I can't believe I waited so long to get it.

I was put off a bit by all the reviews that talked about how fiddly the three stages were and by how much math (arithmetic, really) there is, especially toward the end.

But as it turns out, those factors (though true -- the stages are kind of odd, and klunkily named, especially when you also have 'phases') don't really matter much at all. This thing's near the top of the charts for a reason.

It's the first game that I've purchased since re-entering the hobby that I wanted to play again [i]immediately[/i] after the initial session. Don't worry about the calculations, if you generally like Eurogames you are almost  certain to enjoy this.

It may have been the group I was playing with, but in the few games I've played of this, it felt like very little mattered in the first 75% of the game.  And then most strategy decisions and key plays happened in the final few rounds.  If this game was only 4 or 5 rounds, I'd probably rate it a 7 or 8, but for me it is too long of a game where most of the time is spent going through the motions to get to the interesting turns.

I do not tire of this game.  So much fun. Strategy and auction together makes it really interesting.  Forward planning is essential for playing this game well.  At home we play by hiding cash, it might seem unsportsman like at first, but it adds the extra element of having to be aware how much your opponents are earning and spending.  It is important to know exactly how much cash you have, but working out the real value of cards available at auction is ultimately an art, and makes the game what it is.

I take a mark off though, the player mechanic of leader going last means that games remain so balanced at the end that luck from cards drawn from the stack is augmented.  It is really useful to have a player mechanic that makes games  go to the wire, but its not uncommon for someone to have done a lot of hard work in the game to build an advantage, only for there to be a lucky draw for an opponent who can then go on to win the game.

Its all about being power hungry... literally! In Power Grid, you have the opportunity to delve into the lucrative power industry and bring light to those in the dark. 

Bringing electricity to the whole country isn't that easy (and its never cheap) as you need to purchase efficient power plants and sequester the resources needed to power them. Once those are in the bag, you'll need to establish a foothold in the market by building and connecting your power network across the country. Expanding will certainly help you get closer to being that magnate. But its not about having the most cities, but having the most that light up when you flip that power switch. You can't call yourself a successful power mogul if your network is wrought with frequent blackouts. 

The balance of power in this game doesn't seem to stay in one place. The changing player sequence, the laws of supply and demand and the various changing game stages are some of the mechanisms that provide very interesting twists to the overall game play. Power Grid beautifully depicts the economics of power generation and can bring out the aggressive expansionists, and the business conspirators, among your friends.

Overrated. I liked it, but for the length and learning curve, it's too random. I understand how that could improve replayability, but at the expense of potential player frustration.

I really can't imagine a better-concieved game. The mechanics are flawless, the competition is intense, and nobody ever really feels like they're in an unwinnable position. I can't recommend this game enough. It is my #1 strategy pick any day of the week.

I was worried about the complexity and mathiness of this game, but when i played it i was pleasantly surprised. It's really not very complex, reminds me of Ticket to Ride. Hard to master perhaps, but not hard to learn. But the resource market though! Wow i love how the prices rise and fall based on the availability, that was so cool. Easily my favorite part of this game. Power Grid definitely lives up to the hype.

2 / 5 - Fair.

This is horribly overanalytical and mathematical - it helps to have a calculator to play. I don't much care for the fiddly setup and the mechanism for helping out weaker players either. However, it's saved from complete oblivion by some fun player interaction in the auction and building phases. See my review for more details: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/147504

One of the best uses of turn order. Current favorite game that I don't own. Suffers a bit from the end result being a rather formality. You have the resources, you power the cites, you get money. Still, I was thinking about it the next day and there definitely feels like there is stuff to explore in terms of strategy. I'm just not sure if it gets past 10 plays as being my standard for when deciding if I want to continue playing it or not or is that the point you add on expansion maps.

After 7 plays I have to rate this a 4 if I´m to concur with the rating system. I respect the design, but there is just too much math, too much AP among some players, and I generally don´t like games that continually punishes you for being the leader. I´ll never ask for this, but I may accept a game once every three years or so.

It seems like the game ends more often than not with everyone powering the same number of cities at the end and the money decides the tie breakers. It makes it feel like your decisions throughout the game didn't matter at all, you just got that last few coal for a few bucks cheaper than everyone else to win the game. It's not a terrible way to spend an evening but id much rather play lots of other games.

Game with auctions can never be completely dry even though Power Grid tries hard with it's industrial theme and paper-money. I'm half-kidding, because Power Grid really isn't dry. True, there are players who play this with calculator and calculate every step, and I'm happy for them, but really, you don't have to be such player to enjoy this one. At the end of the day it's a nice, streamlined medium euro with great replayability.

2-Player Comment:
* Power Grid is very disappointing game as it doesn't come with any variant to make auctions work with two (despite promising 2-6 scale). With Robots expansion it's very good 2p game, but managing the Robot does take lots of extra effort.

Expansions:
+France/Italy map expansion
+Benelux/Central Europe map expansion
+New Power Plant cards
+Promo cards
+Robots expansion

I like Power Grid. I like the style of auction used, the network building and the commodity market. The bit I don't like is it's one of those games that you almost can't win from the front - almost every game I've played has been won by the person who was in second place until the last turn. Which really means that it's a game about timing. One of the best games I own nevertheless.

Plus there are expansions up the wazoo, which is always a good thing.

This is a game that I could teach or play with nearly anyone but would not qualify it as a true gateway game.

RATING: 7.5
A very solid game, but not one I feel the need to play often or have in my collection.   

There is alot going on in Power Grid.  Timing and turn order are very important and something that needs to be very carefully managed.  As does the timing of when to buy resources, and the type of plants to build, and how much to pay, and where to expand on the map to block others.  

Difficult for casual play against more regular players as they will be able to more accurately judge the value of the plants up for auction - and manage all the other things.  Would reward repeated play. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Power Grid may forever remain the ultimate "thinky" game. Every decision is self-scrutinized to an obsessive extent and the game has an uncanny ability to make its players demand perfection of themselves.

The feeling of winning a plant for less than its perceived value = priceless.

Great concept and theme. Nice production and rule book. Scales well and I like the resource management, different power options and the different phases. 

However, it’s a bit long and I hate primary auction mechanics. The problem with auctions is that new players never know what to value something at, and since the game takes so long, you’re not going to get a lot of plays in for new players. I like that the cards are pre-printed with values and that does help in many cases, but not enough. 

Edit: Played a few more times and still same randomness of the auction ruins it. Always ends up being a splash down of cities to win. And if after every game every says "well, that was just a weird/bad/unlucky power plant draw", then the game is simply not good enough. 

The randomness of the draws is interesting, but perhaps too random as well. Played a game once where a 36 made it to the auction block while still in the teens really. Definitely changed the game. Though rare and I suppose you could house rule a few things to prevent, especially for learning games. 

Still, a good, tight game with tough decisions, risk, and tension.  If you had some good learning game variants and ways to chop some time down, it would be great.

At first I thought this game was far better than I do now. I usually end the game early out of boredom now, since it tends to choke with people counting hordes of money and waiting for certain power plants to show up in the deck. I think it'd be much better with a chess-clock type setup, but I don't have a many-person clock available right now (maybe a summer project to build one)

I played this for the first time today and I really enjoyed it (despite coming last!).  The mix of network building combined with actually powering cities with the power stations worked really well and provided a thought provoking challenge as well as an arithmetical workout.  Reminded me of some maths classes from secondary school - so I'd almost suggest this could be used as a teaching aid!

UPDATE: Played it again with 4 people and still really enjoyed, in fact, I'm raising the rank to 9!

Long, dry and tedious with an utterly drab theme. The catch up mechanic is far too strong and the game goes on far too long for the lack of depth.

Good game.
The rules are are probably some of the worst written I ever read. The game is fairly simple if you get it explained by someone who knows how to play.
Not one of my absolute favourites because it is slightly fiddly and a little long (2 hours). 
However it hits the table again and again, so it has qualities.

I do not think this is a bad game. I think it 'deserves' a higher rating than I give it. But it is not a game that I would ever say "wow, I desperately want to play that". For my taste, a 6.5 is about right - I can be persuaded to play it, if everyone else wants to, but I won't ever initiate it. Is it the theme? Is it too dry? Not sure.

Great game! I'd own it if the rules weren't so confusing and the game length was less than 2 hours. My wife and I played this with a group that were NOT out for blood and talkes us through the game without trying to make us suffer for our mistakes and we had an EXCELLENT time. The 2+ hours of gameplay went by fast and all in attendance finished comfortably close enough that I wasn't humiliated at game end and felt that I "got it" and would definitely play again... as long as there was someone familiar with the rules to be the MC for the game :)

RATING: 10
Played 8 times.
Last Played March 15, 2009

I played it as a 3 player game and we found it very interesting and very fun.  I liked all the catch up mechanisms built in so you never felt like you were totally out of the game even if you were a little behind everyone else for a little while. 

We had to end the game early due to time constraints but at the end we all had 14 plants and 14 powered so it came down to who had the most money.

Second game was with more players but still had to end it early.  I need to buy this game so I can play it with out running out of time.

Finally bought it and played a full game.  I was way in last place but still enjoyed myself, which is a mark of a good game in my book. :)

Just played it as a 2 player and it was quite good.  The game was close the whole time, and If I had just been quite about my planning rather than mumbling aloud I could have won by powering all 21 when my husband could only power 20, but because I was vocal, he managed to play the auction to his advantage and was lucky that a 7 power plant came out.  So the tiebreaker he sconked me on, $3 to $76

This game is definitely rising on my like list.  I could see it hitting a 10 if I could ever win it. :)

I finally won! :)  Barely... thanks to having the monopoly in Trash and Uranium.  I could only power 16 cities, but nobody else could power more and I had more money (4 player game)

I must be getting better, I just won again and this time pretty hands down. :D

It's a long game, but doesn't feel long, as it's got an interested flow of play, a great auctioning mechanic, and lots of strategizing and interaction.  Probably best if nobody uses a calculator, and everyone is around the same level as far as Math skills go.  Keeps is pretty even.  This game is played with balance in mind.

pretty great game. I've heard gripes about the "first player" mechanic, but oddly the person who won the game was the one who was consistently in the lead most of the time. We were all new players, though, so that could be a part of it. Could use a few more plays to see if I feel that creates imbalance, but it's a higher likelihood that i'd end up playing Arkwright instead.

First euro I played after settlers. I like the theme, love the biddings, love the two sided board (even the artworks) and how the market works through the different steps of the game depending on the number of players and the plants used. Although Power Grid seems hard at first glance, I've found it (with an appropiate explanation) as a great gateway game, because it's a pretty logical experience also fun and competitive! A whole classic.

Power Grid is an unusual game at first. It takes some time to adjust to it's 'clunky' idiosyncracies however I believe these add to the industrial theme and give it character. It is a robust and strategically deep game of economic efficiency that I continue to enjoy with groups of three or more. My favourite "thinking" game and I never get sick of it.

This is one of my favorite games. Lots of decisions without the downtime that can be such a drag in other games. The game is nicely balanced and I have never seen a group of people have more fun powering up cities. One member of our group even gave each of our "power companies" names.  Deep without being stressful, engaging, and beautiful game. The fiddliness of the market and auction blocks is a little bit of a pain. But that is the only downside to the game.

Overrated 

A game is no longer fun when you have players taking out calculators to try and figure out the best move.  This is especially true if their sole purpose of doing so is to prevent a single player from winning in an effort to prolong a game that has already gone on for twice as long has it should have.  Yes, this actually happened.

The game has some positive aspects and is well designed in some ways, but if playing a game feels like a "day job," then it is no longer a game.

I would love to pull this one out and play it to death for a few weeks and give it a solid evaluation....

Edit:
So, my rating is influenced by my group.  I think I've picked up on some of the strategic subtleties quicker than others, and so, the game became too easy/repetitive.  Plus the game plays longer than I'd like...

Still my highest-rated game, both in the original edition and the remake. When played with a group of players who really know how to play this game, it's incredibly competitive and tons of fun. When played with some folks who don't know "how to play well" there can be a runaway leader problem sometimes (depending on the power plants that come up). Aweseome game, amazing fun.

This is a very good economic modeling game.  The power theme is cool and is well built into the game, but the mechanics could work for anything.  It plays very well with 3 and though it doesn't scale that well to 2 players, it is still interesting.  A lot of people comment about problems with the end game and a kill the leader issue, but I really don't see that.  The game rewards good planning in three areas: 1. setting up connection routes (before other players) to lock in cheap connections and potential for cheap expansion. 2. Fuel market calisthenics - making sure you get a reasonable price when purchasing fuel (and also balancing your plants so you're not totally dependent on one fuel.  3. Money management in a tight economy - including having reserves for bidding and doing auctions as smart as possible.

All in all, a very nice game.

It has some great and interesting ideas to keep players from boring for the 1.5 to 2 hours game, but the admin work & calculation work are annoying. Both love and hate it. I also dislike the artwork. The pattern of stations' placement seems repetitive in most games, that can be remediated by real money - buy more expansions. (*Bidding, Economic, Connection)

(Note: the play count might be a little low as I usually credit any in-play expansion used rather than the base game.)

World's greatest subtracting game!

I love Power Grid, I'd give it a 9 if I really thought it was a game.  But with three things (plants, resources and connections) that need to be purchased each round, and needing to look closely at the board to determine their costs, it becomes like a math exercise, and very much like the business simulations I did during my Business Administration days in college.  It's the only game I play with pencil and paper.

The endgame can get quite fiddly and result in some strange auctions for plants depending on what resources are available and what plants are still in the draw pile. (I played one game where the only chance I would have had to win was if I had over 100 Elektro left to buy the 34 plant. Too bad I could only bid 80!)

I find this more fun to play every time I get the chance. I've got a friend who has all the expansions, so we play on a different map each time, and my analysis paralysis seems to be abating with experience. The rating should only go up!

02/01/05 Played a six-player game once, which was 3.2 hours of excruciating number crunching. The game looked nice and I liked its theme, which is why I initially said I’d play it. But I had no idea I’d be doing almost nothing but math for over three hours. So, if you have an accountant type mind, you’ll probably like it. If not it will be as much fun as: doing your monthly budget, your kid’s high school math homework, and your taxes all rolled into one. Oh, and if you get behind, don’t expect to catch up, or hurt the leader. Even all this wouldn’t have caused me to rate it this low if it had been shorter. But after 3.2 hours of it I was mentally exhausted. I won’t quite say I hated it, I reserve that for Age of Steam and Java, but its real close.

Okay, I'm convinced. This is a thoroughly enjoyable game that seems to scale well and strikes the right balance between development and resource management. It only became that after I played it with people who'd worked through the rules and played it a lot though - in my previous attempts it was shocking (pun not intended) because the rules as written are shocking (okay, intended that time). I still think the arithmetic is a bit of a chore, and the resource market is really fiddly - I recently played someone else's game where silly little skinny bits of dowel were used as uranium rods. They constantly fell over and twice rolled off the table. My copy has the new octagonal rods and I'm grateful for that.

A triumph of good game over poor rule book.

Swoon. (*wrote that when I was kinda new to the board gaming thing)

Nice economic game.  Bidding, resource management, turn-order management, and building on the map.  All good stuff.

Game length once again hurts a rather great game.  Fantastic during its year of release, but other games have utilized time more wisely since then.

Will totally play that one again. It could go higher or lower, depending of next games experience. I like the mechanic, theme and strategy, we played a 5 players game and I won before the 3rd phase. I believe it would have been tougher with 6, or 4. It really wasn't that tough to win. There was plenty of room for me to move.

I'd like to try it again, but I might be dissapointed by the lack of direct conflict between the player. Will see next time, I enjoyed that last game, but it was only the first one.

Decía Robert Duvall que no había nada como oler napalm por la mañana, pues si, oler tus propias centrales eléctricas quemando carbón, petróleo y basura.  Las subastas por las centrales junto con el mercado de recursos lo hacen muy recomendado para los que les gusten los juegos econónicos/industriales no muy densos. Tiene una mecanica de juego algo peculiar que penaliza al jugador más aventajado situándolo en último orden de turno.

You can get new cards & new maps, but it's always the same game. Mixing & matching the resources makes for different winning strategies which does improve the game a bit, but in the end, it's just a matter of adjusting your algorithm slightly & you're in with a shot, I guess the player that adjusts best will come out on top.

RATING: 8
As Euro as Euro comes, Power Grid features auctions, resource management, wooden blocks and maths enough to make your phone's calculator bleed. In spite of a bunch of buch of mechanics and rules changing when eras change as the game goes on the game manages to reasonbly and abstractly simulate a cutthroat competitive energy market are retained streamlined gameplay and adequate elegantness. The main draw back is the long session times, especially when playing with AP players, do not expect less than two hours. Recommended with three players or more, probably best with four.

Rating based on a few plays with 5 and 6 players.  I really appreciate the design and feel that I should like it more, but I don't.  It just doesn't sit well with me.  I don't enjoy it much - I think I might at the beginning, but then I don't.  It always feels too long for what it is.  And it can seriously drag due to analysis paralysis.

New in collection Dec.06.

1st impression: brilliant gameplay, plenty interaction. 

Update: played it some more. Love this game. Best Euro in years. Very good balanced gameplay, gotta love that "catch-up" mechanic.
Theme is more fun than it sounds. Points go up, only thing holding back the 10 is the constant calculating....

NL: Funkenschlag is een fantastisch spel. Moet je absoluut gespeeld hebben als je van strategische spellen houdt.

RATING: 10
Wow!  It's been a long time since I've fallen in love with a game before I'm halfway through with my first play, but that's exactly how I felt with Power Grid.  I've thoroughly enjoyed the experience thus far as I never feel overwhelmed by any of the numerous decisions that are made throughout the game, and the steps necessary for victory are often easy to see, while not always easy to execute.  I love the numerous mechanics that have to be carefully balanced, including auctions, resource supply-and-demand, and area control.  It feels like an incredibly deep game with unending replay value, without every feeling overly complex or confusing.  I love this game so much; it's easily another 10 for me.

I have very much enjoyed my two plays so far.  I do have some concern about the timing of the second phase.  Both times I've played the game stalled somewhat before passing the phase 2 mark, resulting in the end of the game coming almost simultaneously with the start of the third phase.

However, I still had a lot of fun.

Not the most exciting theme, but this is a solid economic game and has obviously cemented itself as a euro classic.  The variety available through the various map expansions leave room for added replayability and allowing up to 6 players is very nice for a deeper euro.  Game length and fairly dry play are probably the biggest hits against it.  Not the most appealing game for everyone, but what it does, it does very well.

RATING: 9
Excellent game with many layers of thinking, planning and possible strategies.  This one will have you wondering about what you should/could have done long after the game is over.  It's a long(ish) game  but the time flies.  One small downside is the rule book that could have been a little more clear on the first reading (with confusing use of "turns,"rounds," and "steps" terms.)  Plus there are a bunch of minor money calculations, so be aware of your play crew.  Teaching the game was actually fairly easy.  Not a bad ramp up time at all.  Lots of levels of player interaction.  "Thicker" than most casual games, but very, very enjoyable.  Do buy some poker chips to replace the paper money.  It will speed your play time tenfold.

RATING: 8.5
A pretty fun game.  It forces you to make some decisions during your turn.  My only complaint is that the person in the back can catch up too easily.  It seems to make the decision of when to step in the lead an important one because being behind has its advantages in getting resources and putting on new houses.

RATING: 7
Game in a Nutshell: Almost purely economic game of bidding, resource collecting, and development/expansion in order to power the most plants when the end game is triggered.

Played as: 3 (practice phase) and 4,5 (full game) player

Played with: Power Plant Deck 2 and base deck

Pro: I like the combination of all the different game mechanics and surprisingly stays superbly balanced. Maybe one game that includes an auction and doesn't necessarily feel like it decides the winner.

Cons: Low interaction. Seems like there's way more number crunching then actual strategy and it's easy to botch a crucial play just by forgetting to carry a one or something in your arithmetic.  On top of that, no one seems to be enjoying themselves when this is on the table as there's no real sense of tension or excitement... just people concentrating on their math test.

Other notes: I'm serious when I say I don't really like this game. Despite that, there's a challenge to it that mocks me and a sickness that makes me want to keep giving it another try.

Best Use: I'd say people that would like this the most are ones who like a logic challenge and willing to sacrifice interaction to get it.

I've played it a lot.  It is a good game, but I'm not sure it is a top 5 game.  First, there aren't many distinct strategies, just shades of the same one, driven by timing and jockeying for turn order.  Second, the topological element isn't that important; it can almost be ignored.  Certainly it's much less a factor than turn order, cash, plants, and fuel (even on the Italy map).

There's a good deal of arithmetic, which to me is a drawback.  

OK it's top 25.

//Played this once, and never again. My first game (3 players) took us 3 hours to get through. Halfway through, we were already groaning about it and saying "Has someone almost won by now?", but we had to stubbornly give it a chance and at least finish the game.

Personally found it slow and uninteresting

A really enjoyable economic game about building and powering a power grid across a network of cities. The key is to manage your money in order to both purchase the right power plants for you and the fuel you need as well as afford to expand your network before opponents block you/make it more expensive to do so.

The length of the game counts against it from being a 10. It's hard for me and others to find the muster for 2.5 hours of one game. But everytime we do it's to the wire, hard thinking, and works well with anywhere between 3 and 6 players. Nov 2013 (down to 6.5 from 8.5). Got a bunch of plays in that cemented my feelings here. I don't like that step 3 suddenly stops the game. There's a good 10-20 minutes where people are just doing math to analyze their now available routes. If that didn't happen, I'd be happy to call this an 8.

Mechanics (particularly related to the three Steps) are a little clunky, but serve the game well in maintaining the game's pace.

A gamers' game - unlikely to go over well with non-gamers or new gamers.

Great game combining auction, area control, and resource managment. My initial impression of the game was that the catch up mechanism was too strong and that it doesnt matter what yo do for except for the last 2 rounds of the game. However, the more I play, the more I think there is a tremendous amount of subtlety to the game. The longer playing time often makes it hard to get 4-5 player games together, but great fun when you do.

This game has grown on me the more I have played it. It is definitely my go to game when I have a group of 6. Most common complaint is that there is too much math, which can be annoying for some (and hard to do late night). I liked the game enough to buy a couple of the expansions.

Best with 2-4 players (takes too long with 5 or 6). Really outstanding balance…you never know who is going to win until it's over, and a fantastic supply & demand mechanic. I'd rate it higher except that it's too heavy on the use of addition as part of every turn for my taste.

I don't know why I have so much fun playing these extremely tight, crowded management games.  Probably because I love the challenge.  There are a lot of economic and area control decisions to make, and you'll pay for any missed opportunities.  I got slaughtered on my first game which I expect is common against experienced PG players.  [German map]  UPDATE:  Played the US maps, finally.  The West is expensive but one or two people may find that they can block it off and keep it for themselves.    We blocked out the NorthEast which made the map very tight.

I honestly don't know what to rate this. I only played it once and a few things bothered me. At the time, I was looking for a good economic game and this game did a few things that bugged me, like have a supply/demand market that wasn't fully driven by players and an end game win condition that wasn't fully based on the engine you built.

However, having played other games since then that do scratch those itches as well as being more open to euro mechanics now, I want to see how this game would play as I play it for itself, and not for what I wish it to be

So many praised this game.  I was happy to finally get a chance to play it.  Man, would I like those two hours of my life back.
No meaningful interaction between players other than a tedious bidding phase, overly long, and an obvious winner after about the fourth turn.  Why this game is regarded so highly is so beyond me.  I was told that it would probably be more fun with different people to play with (which would be true of most games, but that is more a comment on those I played with) but I can't see it.  The only reason this isn't a solid 1 is because I could see it maybe being an entertaining 2 player game with sizable rules modifications.

1 play, knew I needed to play after seeing the www.boardgameswithscott.com review.  The resource system is really neat.
Basically you compete on 3 fronts.  Everyone competes by bidding for powerplants, connecting cities, and buying up resources.
Here's my newbie tip:  DON'T overbid on a powerplant on your first turn!!!  Or you'll be doomed...as I was.  But it was still very very interesting!

Very good eurogame with different mechanics that are perfectly merged.

PROS
- The different parts of the design are incredibly well merged, resuting in a great optimization experience
- High degree of interaction through bidding and map blocking
- The sense of development is fantastic

CONS
- It takes a long time (normally more than 2 hours for me)
- Implies a ton of calculating, so if someone dislikes that they'll hate the game

I've never enjoyed a game i suck at so much more than power grid. Seriously, I suck. I've only won this game once. The game has transcended into a classic.  feel as if this is the king of economic games. It scales great for 3-6 players, components are top notch in all versions, and there are so many expansions you could almost never play the same game twice. Love this game, just wish I'd win more. 

Original box in Box #2 at Dad's. Game components in medium bitbox with all other PG components.

This game is significantly more simple to play than it first appears, though introducing new people to it can be painful.

(+) Dynamic resource market adjusting prices to demand
(+) A tense game where generally about half of the players are threats to win at the end
(+) Building connections is fun

(-) Perhaps over-rewards those with fewest stations - very hard to maintain any lead
(-) Can be very, very long - especially with those who haven't played before and those prone to AP.
(-) Terrible as a two-player game

While this isn't my first choice game, it's often my second choice, and often a lot of people's second choice, so it hits the table quite a lot.

First two games played May 20, 2006 (both with 5 players).  A fantastic game that will likely be played a great deal in the future.  Some mild confusion with the rules initially, although common sense appeared to clear the problem up.  The mechanics are really exceptional with the resource market and with the historical change in the efficiency of the plants.  I can't wait to play this again.

Power Grid has a little too much math for my tastes. Your total expenses for each turn should be summed up at the start of the turn. I have fun at it anyway, so I can see why people who don't mind the math rate it as highly as they do.

Great economics game. Three markets you have to act in: first the acquisition of new power-plants, then getting the required ressources for them and third to get new lines  to supply more towns. The more you supply, the more money you get and you can start again to buy newer plants, buy ressources,... Simple, but great fun to play!

Played once with three players on the France expansion map, once with four players on the Belgium expansion map, and once with three players on the USA map.  Players bid for power plants, buy resources to power those power plants, and buy networks that connect cities that they provide power to (and thus earn money).  Just about everything in the game is limiting (power plants, resources, city connections), and there are many excruciating decisions to make on each turn.  Unfortunately the game includes a tremendous amount of budgeting at every point (budgeting well is _key_ to victory), which slows things down and makes it less enjoyable than it might be otherwise.  Scoring occurs solely at the end of the game (which is of indeterminate length), which is a neat mechanic, but it means that the entire game revolves around how you perform on one turn.  This is a bit frustrating for many reasons, not the least of which is that it seems like the optimal strategy may be to try to lag behind and surprise everyone else on the last turn (and it also means that predicting the timing of the last turn is crucial, yet it's very difficult for unexperienced players).  

While I enjoy the meatiness of this game, I'd like it far better if it only took 1-2 hours to play instead of 3-4, and if there was more to the scoring than just the last turn.  

[Added after my third play: I'm realizing just how important experience is in this game; in my third game I played with people who were similarly unexperienced, and enjoyed it far more (even though I still lost).  Just like with chess, this experience requirement results in a game that's not much fun until you put the time into it to learn all the minutiae (unless you only play with players at a similar experience level).]

[Note: score lowered from 7.5 to 6 after the second playing]

Another fantastic gateway game. You know this has to be good when, as a college student, you teach and play a game with new players, and then go out, only to come home early and play 3-4 more games into the morning. Works well with new players since the experienced players seem to compete against each other and leave the newbies alone, only to see the newbies take the victory at the end.

RATING: 9
In “Power Plant,” players acquire (through auctions) and manage various types of power plants and try to power as many cities as possible. It’s played in three “steps” and at the end of the game the player who powers the most number of cities wins. The rulebook is somewhat badly written, which was cause for initial concern. However, I’m happy to say the game is solid! There are lots of bits to remember and do (I suggest printing out a reference sheet) but it's defiantly fun and engrossing. A great resource management game in the medium weight category. Recommended!

Buy power plants in auction, buy resources to use them and expand your network to supply most cities with power.

Plays: 1.
Type: VP engine = a game where you build an engine to collect victory points most efficiently.
Complexity: Medium.
# of players: See BGG.
Playing time: See BGG.
Player interaction: Competition for scarce resources – power plants and cities. Competition for unlimited resources for plants. Auctions. 
Randomness: Almost none.

Replayability: Medium. There is depth to explore.
Fun: In spite of being a (almost) perfect information efficiency engine, I don’t immediately hate it. I think I would hate it if available power plants were also perfect information. That slight uncertainty is enough for me to consider this number crunching a bit of fun. The interaction in auctions is also a bit exciting.
Memorability: Low, it’s a VP engine that doesn’t create stories.

Thematic integration: Strained.
Components: Functional.

Who will like this: Strategy gamers.

Purchased early on during my time in New Haven, I ended up playing this several times, always with people who didn't like it... and so I grew to not like it myself.  The premise is sound (trying to make the most money powering the largest area possible) and there are two different maps so it has higher replay value - but those initial negative experiences of playing it saw this game sit unplayed for years.  Sold during my auction.

Great economic euro a little more on the heavier end of things.  Have had a lot of fun in the few plays I've had.  There is a real issue with the sandbagging/leader-punishing mechanic, but I knew that going in, and it really IS part of the game, so if you play to it, I didn't see it as a problem.  Still would have been nice to not have that "meta-game" at all, and for the designer to find a more creative way around those issues.  But that's pretty much the only complaint I have. Love the auctions, planning ahead for the cities you want, upgrading your power plants, the supply-demand mechanic; none of it is new or unique, but it all works quite well. I have not played 2 or 3 player, so I cannot comment on the scaling there.

Interesting theme, simple rules, good lenght (3 to 4 hours), good number of players (4 to 5 is good). But...not enough interaction for me! Still willing to play most of the time since my group is thrilled with this one. They compete a lot so i can't stay behind. Only won once though, in many games played.
AFTER A FEW MORE GAMES: still fun, but has the same problem as many german longer games, like Wallenstein, which is to make you think a lot and for long. Brainburners like these come less often off the box. Anyway a great simulation and good fun.
UPDATE2008: again it is a great simulation and has very good mecanics. Too heavy for the casual eurogamer inside of me. Tremendous collective headache in the final hour of play!
OVERALL: 3 hours doing stuff and 1 final hour (2 or 3 turns only) hammering your mind for an optimized solution.

Kőkemény, patikamérlegen kibalanszolt stratégia, aminek megvannak ugyan a mélységei, engem mégsem fogott meg annyira. Ebben a témája sem segít, nehéz beleképzelni magunkat egy áramszolgáltató mindennapjaiba. Nagyon komoly, nagyon összetett, kvázi nulla szerencsefaktorral, ez viszont az élvezhetőség rovására megy (szvsz). Lásd még analízis-paralízis.

Szóval jó-jó, de nem az igazi. (Vagy csak én játszottam keveset vele.) Ettől még persze biztosan sokaknak ez a kedvence, amit mutat az előkelő BGG helyezése is.

Eladni persze nem fogom, mégis csak egy klasszikus és még az is lehet, hogy megszeretem...

UPDATE (2016.12.19.): Nem rossz ez, csak "szokni kell". Kipróbáltam a szóló módot, de az igazi valószínűleg minimum négy játékosnál lesz. Remélem egyszer alkalmam nyílik arra is.

Our first play of Power Grid was extremely fun. If the 2 player game (which everyone says is kind of lame) is this much fun, can't wait to see how it goes with more.

Plays 2 and 3 were less fun. I seem to have some sort of mental block regarding the flow of this game. 

Sold to Gary at ROBA for $30.

Very good economy game. The auctions are tough, but in general the game is more forgiving than Age of Steam, my other favourite money-making game. The new version is superior to the old one. The basic game is the same, but the components are better and the game is more streamlined.

Yet, I ended up trading this away; I needed the money and felt that I'd probably prefer Age of Steam in the rare cases I have time for something like this.

Indifferent.

Awesome! Great mechanics. The auction is amazing. If you don't like math I could see how you might not like this game but it's a great economic game. Makes you think and after the game is over you'll talk about the game that was just played every time. Sometimes it can end a little anti-climaticly, usually when there is a runaway winner and that's not too fun

Power grid has fallen a tad in my rankings. Obviously it's another Euro classic, but I am finding a few issues in continued play:

1. The indirect effect of starting position makes too big of a difference amongst good players. Once near-optimal play is occurring, randomly having to spend an extra 10-20 on the final turns makes a huge difference.
2. Each metagame has a clear best value for each plant. Most of the skill of the game is knowing this information going in and executing, or getting lucky when you are up for last pick.

Obviously there is a lot of skill and dynamics involved in the game, but personally I find other Euros more engaging at this point.

My all time favorite Eurogame.  I love the graph and the jockeying for both first and last place.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Dry, mathy, boring; an ultimately irritating experience. What is the appeal? Were it not for the nice, kitschy art and high production quality, this could just as easily have been a spreadsheet we were all filling in. Even with the auction phase, which I normally like, it was hard to actually care about any of it. Something about the theme rubs me the wrong way.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fun game.  I had previously only played the card game version.  Actually needing to purchase the rights to move into a city added extra strategy to the game.  I eked out the win, but could have lost.  In the card version of the game you simply must have the ability to power more--late in the game I gave up a decent plant to buy another that only produced one more in order to tie with another player's maximum amount.  That's a must-do in the card game, but in the board game you must also consider the need to buy the city rights.  If I had passed on the plant purchase, I would have had the money to be the first and only player in the round to power 17 cities, which is a win condition in the board game.

Confieso que la primera vez que jugué no me gustó nada (fue una partida a dos jugadores), la segunda tampoco y mi marido pensó en venderlo. Pero le dimos una tercera oportunidad y se ha convertido en uno de nuestros juegos preferidos. No lo disfrutamos tanto como nos gusta porque no es un juego para todos los gustos, a dos (y normalmente somos dos)no nos gusta, así que lo reservamos para un par de grupos de amigos.

I have to confess that first time I played I didn't like it (it was a 2 players play) second time neither and my husband thought about trade it. But we gave it a third chance and it has became one of our favourite games. It is no for every one taste, althougth we love it we only play with two couples from time to time.

Alright! Finally got to play this, albeit in an aborted session. Definitely intriguing. Highly computational. I was doing the "maths" the whole way through, [-]and it seemed like I was going to dominate, but I have no idea what the endgame has in store.[/-] (According to comments elsewhere, "dominating" early is a recipe for disaster later on.) That said, we stopped right around the point I grow bored of computational games, so the full game might not have fared very well. My interest is now piqued in Medieval Merchant, often described as a quicker version of Power Grid without the resource market. Definitely interested in playing again, but I don't see this becoming a favorite of mine.

We don't like this game as much as we want to. It seems too much as a math game in which you need to optimize every turn as much as you can.

Theme of the game and sight of the board was not intriguing or eye catching. Did nothing to pull me into the game. 
Horribly Long.  
I did not enjoy the bidding for resources in the beginnning. Who knows how much is too much to pay for something when you first start? unless you are told by somebody with experience. 
Other rotteness could be attributed to the people I played with and the person who taught the game and that the board was slightly bumped and those idiotic round bits rolled everywhere. All around bad experience that I don't ever want to return to.

Power Grid is a very good economic game, but it's grown a bit stale for me.  The auctions & commodity market simulation are absolutely great; but the stuff that happens on the board is very linear and scripted-feeling.  It doesn't give you any room for creativity or variety.  This gives the game a somewhat linear, obvious and restrictive feeling.

As a big fan of 18xx games, I tend to like the heavyweight, theme-rich, German offerings such as Die Macher.

How best to spend your money is the hard part.  After just one play of this game, I am now a very big fan of clean burning power plants. :)

Playing power grid isn`t complicated. The phases are logical and it is possible to play this game intuitively. Still it is strategically one of the deepest games I know. It is all about timing, resource management and also reading other players intentions. Some might claim power grid is too mathy, but I think a 10-year old should be able to do the math required in the game. It is completely another question if the tactic you picked was right in that current situation.

Wonderful game.

A few days later we had some friends over after church and had a blast. Th actioning is super fun. It is also great playing a game that is well balanced and not luck heavy.

This has become a 'darling' of the BGG community in the past 2 years but for me it is too much of a brain burner and it outstays its welcome by playing 1 hour longer than it should.

RATING: 10
My favourite of the long playing euros we've played, although I find Power Grid flows well (once you first decipher the rules) and the time flows on by very quickly.

I love the market mechanic, the auctions , the reverse order for the last place and selecting where you connect. Many cool mechanics all used together to give a realistic feel to an economic game. Games are close and there is a strong "race" feeling which keeps a great and building level of tension. Auctions and power plant cards give a randomness to the game which adds to replayability.

The maths, well hey a little basic arithmetic never hurt anyone.

Plays fine with two (we've tried US and Benelux), if not a little long. I can't see that it's as bad at all for two as some have said.

I'm hoping the other maps and even the new power plant cards coming might make a quicker game and maybe have some extra features for 2 player games.

RATING: 8.5
I love most the catch-up mechanic, and how it in itself becomes a legitimate part of strategy/tactics rather than something to help weaker players. I also love the way the auction phase functions, how you move across the map trying to both build up some income as fast as possible whilst also trying to subtly set yourself up for the end game (all the while trying to predict where your opponents will move as well since this directly impacts your choices), how the three phases function, how the whole game revolves around setting up your final turn (this was a tad disappointing at first, but the more I play the more I like it: every action you take has to take account of where you want to be at the end of the game). The only thing which isn't amazing is that the calculating linkage costs between two cities can sometimes be awkward, but it isn't too big a hassle considering how rewarding the rest of the game is. Also the game is sometimes be easily lost depending on where your opponents place their initial building relative to yours.

We both love this game.  We do have some complaints - one part of the rules was difficult to understand, the fuel is fiddly to set up [which has to be done every turn], and the large size of the board [we play on a small table].  But we did like the way the game seems to be designed so it's a close run, the artwork, the choice of boards, the auction, the option of co-operation, the way prices change according to demand, the different options, etc.

Гениальная игра! Видно, что вылизывалась и оттачивалась не один год. Единственный недостаток: слишком мало случайности, из-за чего у некоторых игроков случаются "зависания" в попытке просчитать, что им сейчас выгоднее делать. Правда с другой стороны, сильно влияние случайности выпадения электростанций.

2004 Funkenschlag.  The fiddly paper money aside this game looks great.  I just love the 50ies design and typography.  The board is just gorgeous, and doublesided to boot.  One side is Germany, the other the USA, and both maps have their own things to keep in mind, so games on either map will be quite different.  As for the game itself; very deep, lots of parameters, easy to play, hard to master.  And, plays great with 2 as well as with more.  Great addition to my collection and deserves its top ten spot here on the Geek.  Hint: Play with Kraftwerk music in the background!

This is a great game. The rules are a little more difficult than games I typically like to play. There are several special case rules and the rules change depending on the number of players. This keeps the game consistent and balanced. I think I would prefer a less consistent and balanced game to have to remember fewer special cases. If you can get past that, it is an awesome game with beautiful components. If you play with similarly minded people it is very fun.

Something about this game just makes me want to play it.  I know I have read the negative reviews, and they all have a point.  But the power plant cards "pop" out to me and are very visually appealing, along with board.  And yes, the game does have quite a few figgity rules and can get mathy.I still like it a lot, and am glad to have this in my collection.

RATING: 9
I really like PG. This may sound strange...but it feels like a game pulled out of the 1970's and a modern Euro game rolled into one. I really like the feel of the mechanisms in the game...and if anything...I actually enjoy the "fiddlyness" of the rules slightly. I like the flow of the game and the balancing mechanisms in each phase. I even like the fiddlyness of how power plants are constantly removed as it keeps the game moving along and interesting. I haven't played this enough to evaluate whether it will be a long term success but it's certainly one of the best "economic" games around. Definitely a game I look forward to getting on the table. I still want to play this with a full complement of 6 players to see if that stretches the limits of the gaming system somewhat.

Power Grid seamlessly combine several good mechanisms for an intense and interactive game. The players compete both on the market, by bidding for plants and buying resources at a fluctuating (but predictable) price, and on the map, by connecting own plants and blocking competitors' access.

I particularly like the rubber band mechanism, where the leader is bidding first and buying last, giving him or her less favorable market conditions and keeping the game open to the very end.

The game may feel slightly too repetitive and long but the development of more efficient plants and opening of new sites for them add some variation. Power Grid deserves its good reputation.

Great idea for a game...real fun for economically oriented builder types and planners...beautiful maps...neat auction system for power plants with current and futures market...this is a very good game for really any number between 2-6 from my experience....now I like the 2P version as well but didn't at first...moving rating up again to a 10 after repeated plays...there is a real shortage of good economic games but this hits the spot perfectly.  The game is a delicate balance between turn order, plant capacity, the race for cities on the map, the luck factor of "the flip" of power plants, the auction mechanism and finally supply and demand for the four resource types.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game has some nice touches including the ebb and flow of the availability to expand one's networks.  But the game falls flat for me because the auctions and plant placement only occasionally get interesting.  The cost of the power plants escalate consistent with their value.  While this makes for a balanced game, it lessens the importance of the auction.  The purchase of resources becomes a chore and the placement of plants on the board rarely takes much thought.  Most of the game involves performing math correctly so that you can spend appropriately in three areas.  I think the game either needs to be more difficult and involve a threat of insolvency (a la Age of Steam) or provide players with excess cash so that auctions and expansion are more fun.  To clarify, we have only played with 6 players.  Perhaps more cash is available with fewer players.  This may move my rating up slightly, but this is a long game for the limited level of decisions that are made.

Very involving game, many pieces and steps to take.  Lots of fun for almost the entire game.  For some reason the last 2-3 rounds at the end of the game are boring becuase the winner is more or less assured (occured in 2 and 4 player games).  It's fairly anticlimatic and a real let down after playing an hour and a half or longer game.  There just isn't an exciting conclusion at the end after all that work. But a great game up to that point.

Optimising two digit sums is not a fun puzzle nor fun mathematics. Mechanics are fine, but the game is clearly designed for robots (who would easily solve the game and play perfectly).

I like how the game is played. Each part of a turn has different mechanism. 

But I don't like the US map as people who start in the north east get huge advantage because the cheap connection costs. So I usually play the Germany side of the board. It's fun, but after a while it gets boring. And this is why i decrease my rating for it from 9 to 8.

I may consider buying an expansion map. I think a new map will make the game become interesting again.

The best strategic game I have played.  Just with the US map every game will be different depending on regions selected, power plants that drop, and locations players go.  Then, every map can play very differently from all the rest.  The thing that makes this game stand out is the balanced game play through the plant auctions and the turn order system.  If you get ahead in cities, then you buy resources last, so knowing when to surge ahead and when to hold back is crucial.  The hidden money prevents anyone from being sure who is going to win most of the time, as well.  This is a masterpiece of a game, even before considering expansions and the Deluxe version that is now out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Only one play but it seems all of the complaints in the reviews are true, the leader kept the lead and the game is a bit fiddly.  It started to drag a little before step 2, but then picked up again once the floodgates of city building opened again.  Still very enjoyable.

Outstanding. Very tense game. Too much math for my group, but for certain, a brilliant game. I loved it.

I would like to play this game more. 7 is probably too low for such a great game! After more games, this rating will improve, for sure.

2007/06/16: WoW... OUTSTANDING. This will become one of my favorites.

2007/06/30: Every single PG game just shows me how great this game is. Today, I realized that I enjoy playing it even more than T&E. My new #2, right behind Age of Steam. This game is full of interaction, resource management and brain burning situations. I love it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Overall comment: auction game that requires good money management and the ability to value the plants available against network expansion.  Game plays very different with various groups.

Ratings:
Initial(wow factor): 10 (everything looked great coming out of the box)
Family: 7 (bidding has to be modified to get it played - rarely requested)
Game group: 6 (not enough happening to make the game interesting - AP has pretty much shut this game down, no longer requested)
AP effect: 3 (this game is brutal, way too much downtime with serious players)
Solo play: 8 (#4 SoloPlay - very interesting and no AP, mimics the core game elements and produces a satisfying and quick result)

When purchased: 2006
Luck factor (1-10high): 6 (new power plants entering the market can cause a high luck factor expecially for the last to buy a plant)
Recommend expansions: Yes (initial boards get old quick)
Age range: 8+ with alterations to acquiring plants, 10+ otherwise

Reason purchased: Geek analysis

Pros: good components, interesting game design and mechanics, solo play has saved this own from the "never play it again" bin
Cons: AP deathblow, very little variance between games (expansions add a bit), game does not flow well consistently, too much posturing for turn order with experienced players so there is very little expansion and almost no step 2 except in the solo game

Recommendation: Marginal (needs expansions which increase the cost of the game to make it interesting but Power Grid enthusiasts don't like playing anything but the base game)
Replay rating: Below average
Game value (play/cost): Marginal (solo play saved this one)

I've played it a few times now online, and I'm very excited about it. I find it a very fun, elegant puzzle. Or actually, more like 3 very fun puzzles sort of merged into one. I could imagine it becoming a little stale, though, and I find it odd that simply coming out with new maps and power plants is supposed to keep the game fresh and alive, and I'm actually surprised to see it at #3. I probably won't buy it myself, as I don't see it appealing very much to my friends/family, but I will probably be playing it for a while longer on BSW.

It's crazy how the author planned EVERYTHING and mechanized every rule of the market. The inverted turn order is pure genius. I don't know if is there any game like this but this game would probably deserve a 10\10.
At start can look and feel a bit strange but once u got how it works it's like looking at a working engine. Everything goes to it's place, turn by turn, untile the game finish and u didnt even realised that time passed. Really, this game is perfect.

RATING: 8
Fantastic gamer game for 4 - 6 players.  What I mean by that is that the game is more about an interlocking set of mechanics than about theme or modeling a real-life problem.  Let's face it, the mechanics are somewhat arbitrary.  Why does the last place person in one turn get to bid first the next?  Because it makes for an interesting game.  Why does the plant market not move in a linear fashion (as opposed to repeated rearrangements based on price), because it makes for a an interesting game.  Why are some paths between cities expensive and others cheap?  Because those numbers make for conditional situations that are interesting.  Why does the energy market for uranium, etc. replenish in the manner given, because that produces an interesting long-term decision. Etc.

What I'm getting at, is that on one level, PowerGrid is dry.  On another, the decisions that it puts into play are incredibly interesting.  Also, the mechanics are very quick to grasp after a single turn or two.  As some reviewers have pointed out, this produces a game that is very easy to learn, but very difficult to play well.  

On the whole, I'd say that PowerGrid earns immediate respect from me as a game, but I doubt that it will generate the joy that I experience with certain other games.  It's an interlocking set of puzzles, and a rather brilliant design, but lacks the thematic drama that I need to catapult a game into my top-most tier.

RATING: 7
"I was told there'd be no math..." Well, you were told wrong. Lots of counting up your money in Power Grid to make sure you have enough to do everything you need to do. Great looking game, interesting mechanisms, but to me it hasn't yet delivered the thrills a great game should.

RATING: 7
Players bid for power plants that either use coal, oil, waste, uranium or wind for power. Resources are bought at a certain price scale (and replenished at the end of a turn at a certain quantity). Interesting game in that the most advanced player goes last in buying resources and connecting cities, creating a lot of ebb and flow in the game. Fairly long game, more than 3 hrs each time. Engaging, but not particularly satisfying since there are some factors in play such as opponents trying to build and potentially cut you off (playing Kingmaker), if you buy a plant and are out of the auction, a better plant might flip up, opponent may buy up resources even if game is ending just to deny you. It's all right, I think you have to be in the mood for this one.

Playing a bit of this solo (SoloPlay variant rules), and thoroughly enjoying myself.  Considering I'd only ever played this once previously at a games expo, I'm surprised at just how well this game provides a measured challenge, a sense of progress, and a real sense of satisfaction at completion.
Astonishingly, this same game plays as engrosingly with 6 players.  I feel privileged to own a copy of this game.

Excellent game! Requires a mix of long term planning and dynamic responses to what others are doing and how the power plant market changes. However, can go a little long and end abrupt when someone builds 5-6 houses in one hit. This just requires more economic calculations, particularly of other peoples ability, but also reading what they will do. Being behind on the leader board (last in turn order) has its advantage but is not key to winning: I have won while staying in the lead all game and also while staying behind all game. Its all about management!!!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Resource manipulation and management is the best I've seen in any game - it truly resembles supply and demand, and the market can even run out!

The math crunching feels good in my head, and I love how luck/chance plays such a low role in the game. There's almost never an easily seen optimal move, and the rubber-band advantage the last player gets is great for not letting anyone fall behind too much. The double sided game board is a great value for your money, and I've heard great things about expansion maps like Korea/China.

Some small issues keeping it from a 10: game can be a little long (2 hours+ for beginners), some rules/slight exceptions can be difficult, its a little fiddly getting the resource market set up (I heard the Deluxe edition has better resources), and the game can move slowly sometimes (also supposedly improved in the Deluxe edition)

Amazing euro game

Plays: Many (10+)

New Funkenschlag is better than Clayon Funkenschlag. Very good economics game that works well with 6 players. I would like to try expansion power plants and other maps.

RATING: 6
This is a good econ game. The auction system is an interesting mechanic that making pricing very interesting along with the fuel market. I found the city board less interesting and overall it was mostly a big arithmetic problem to keep track of money to bid and money to buy for fuel and expansion. This could lead to a lot of AP which slow the game down and sapped much of the fun.

Variants for PG /PG Exp:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Reduces waiting times during bidding considerably
 One player registers an initial bid of at least the plant's number.

 Other players bid, out of turn, without waiting for players to bid or pass. 

 The last person to bid gets it if he is not outbid within about 10 seconds. 
Player order to break any ties.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When we play with the EXP deck, we refill the fuel at the rate of one fewer players than are actually playing to increase the now dull competition in the resource market due to the higher efficiency of plants in the new deck.

~~~~~~~~~~~~
Use the entire new plant deck (46 plants). But in addition to normal setup and game rules, and "step 2 and game end" rules, consider these changes:

2 players—Players may only have 3 plants. Remove 12 random plants. Step 2 occurs at 9 cities.
3 players—Remove Plant 60, and remove 11 random plants. Game End occurs at 19 cities.
4 players—Remove Plants 60 and 57. Remove 6 random plants. Game End at 18 cities.
5 players—Remove Plants 60, 57, and 54. Remove 1 random plant. Game End at 16 cities.
6 players—Remove Plants 60, 57, 52, and 52. Everything else as normal.

~~~~~~~~~~~~
For the purists:
Note I am assuming all plants up to and including #13 remains in the game and in order. I guess you could spice things up a bit by increasing the current plant market to six plants up until #13 appears on the futures (after the third plant has been bought). At this time, remove the two lowest plants without replacing them (reducing the current market back to four plants again). This means that if the first three players do not buy the #1 or the #2, the game will run exactly like if #3 was the lowest plant, like in the base rules.

So far, we've got:

#1 3 Oil -> 1 City (new plant)
#2 1 Garb -> 1 City (new plant)
#3 1 Oil -> 1 City (new plant)
#4 2 Coal -> 1 City 
#5 2 O/C -> 1 City 
#6 1 Garb -> 2 Cities (expansion)
#7 3 Oil -> 2 Cities
#8 3 Coal -> 2 Cities
#9 1 O/C -> 1 City (new plant)
#10 3 Coal -> 3 Cities (new plant)
#11 1 Uran -> 2 Cities
#12 2 O/C -> 2 Cities
#13 Eco -> 1 City
#14 3 Coal -> 4 Cities (expansion)
#15 2 Coal -> 3 Cities
#16 2 Oil -> 3 Cities 
#17 2 Uran -> 3 Cities + 1 Uran (new)
#18 Eco -> 2 Cities
#19 2 Garb -> 3 Cities
#20 3 Coal -> 5 Cities 
#21 2 O/C -> 4 Cities
#22 Eco -> 2 Cities
#23 1 Uran -> 3 Cities
#24 2 Garb -> 4 Cities
#25 2 Coal -> 5 Cities
#26 2 Oil -> 5 Cities
#27 Eco -> 3 Cities
#28 1 Uran -> 4 Cities
#29 1 O/C -> 4 Cities
#30 2 Garb -> 5 Cities (new)
#31 3 Coal -> 6 Cities
#32 3 Coal -> 6 Cities
#33 Eco -> 4 Cities
#34 1 Uran -> 5 Cities
#35 1 Oil -> 5 Cities
#36 3 Coal -> 7 Cities
#37 Eco -> 4 Cities
#38 3 Garb -> 6 Cities (new)
#39 2 Uran -> 5 Cities + 1 Uran (new)
#40 2 Oil -> 6 Cities
#42 2 Coal -> 6 Cities
#44 Eco -> 5 Cities
#46 1 Uran -> 6 Cities (new)
#50 Fusion -> 6 Cities
#52 3 O/C -> 7 Cities (new) 
#54 3 Garb -> 7 Cities (new) 
#56 2 Uran -> 7 Cities + 1 Uran (new)
#60 Fusion -> 8 Cities (expansion)

"Correcting game length: A straight-forward solution is to note there is six more plants than in the base game (effectively four if you apply the house-rule above) and then simply removing four more random plants than usual (four instead of zero for a five player game, for instance).

On the other hand, you might think this makes the game a bit too random - especially for games that already remove random plants (four players or less). One idea then is when preparing the deck when starting a game, you put the new top plants (the #52, #54, #56 and #60) under the "Step/Stufe 3" card already from the beginning. This keeps the number of plants until Step 3 begins about the same."

RATING: 10
The game that has improved most steadily (and stealthy) in my game riddled mind over time. Is clocking at 10 at the moment, as rating it will not lose very soon. As a 4-6 player game it has few competitors. I love the aspect that every decision feels crucial, a slight brainburner but is not annoying in any way. For a euro game it's easy to learn and easy to teach, everyone (from seasoned players to beginners(!)) I've played with has got a hang of it after the first round. The only minus is that as a 5 and 6 player game it can last for quite a while (3 hour sessions have not been uncommon) if you've got non-seasoned players participating. Disliked by none in my gaming group.

Does NOT work with 2 players.

[--- What I like about it ---]
I love the theme.  I like the supply and demand mechanic.  And I like that you have the ability to think and plan a couple turns ahead.

[--- What I don't like about it ---]
If you end up with a runaway game, then the very last turn of the game is almost pointless in playing.  Once someone builds in the last city and you see that they can power them, you can pretty much look at the other players to see if anyone is a contender.  If not, then you almost feel like stopping early and declaring a victor.

[--- Other comments ---]
The English translation of the rules are not written in the most fluid style.  But once you've played a few times, then you get past that.

It was ok, but it was too long. I didn't realize it would be so long, and I think other games have this much strategy without taking 2+ hours. (I thought it was because of all the new players that added to the length the first time I played; but then I played several games on BSW in real time and it still took over an hour for each game - there's just so much math!) I like math-heavy games, (Kingdoms) but not when they take this long. I rated it an 8, because it's playable online, but I don't think I'll play again Ftf. (1 play FtF, 5+ online)

One of the best strategy games ever.  I just can't help but compare any game to this.  This always just comes back to be my favorite game.

Amazingly good game with plenty of depth.  3 games at once (area control, power plant development and resource management).  Very tight games, and everyone seems to enjoy and be willing to play again.  Seem to have a good winning record so far, but expect that to change.  Just watch out for those deals and push the envelope on saving money.  Games always come out far closer than you expect at 5-6 players.  2 player game not really that enjoyable, lacks tension.  Can't wait to see the expansions!

Finally got a chance to play Power Grid and: Wow, what a great game! I haven't nailed down the mechanics yet (they are a tad complex), but we had a blast playing it. This looks to become family favorite. 

edit: It is official. At least for me, starting on the West Coast of the US board is a death curse. I think I've ended up a distant last place each time I start my cities in the western purple region. 
Still, what a great game!

7/12/10:It seems to be a general consensus in the family that the endgame of Power Grid kinda stinks. Great theme and mechanics on the way to the end, but then it just stops. The most recent game came down to all 4 players counting money to determine the winner.

Its problems are its speed and its vulnerability to analysis. I like the concept and the general execution, but I fear the potential for nigh-endless number-crunching. However, if the player group is right for the game, it can play quickly enough. So far, the fun has been outweighing the drawbacks.

Rules and board are not very attractive at first glance. However I like to play this game. The design of the power plants and the gameplay works very well. You have interesting decisions to make. It's fun to see the evolution of the power plants and supply them. You can be also ecological!

RATING: 6
Fun game.  Has a real "anxiety" feel to it, especially when bidding on the power plants.  I enjoy being able to see the future market, but it turn out to be nothing more than a tease as they might not come up (or even go away).  The one downer for this game for me is that I just don't like the theme.  If the theme was more solid, this would be a great game.  It's still a very good one, and I will definitely (and want to) play it again, but that is why the rating suffered some for me.  A lot of fun with 5 players.

The resource market is a very well developed game mechanic and I would absolutely love to see other games implement this style of resource management.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fantastic game for any number of players between 3 and 6, with an acceptable amount of downtime between turns and some clever mechansims built into the game to keep things close without totally hosing the leader. ***UPDATE*** The new version, Power Grid, is a great improvement to an already awesome game. The biggest complaint of Funkenschlag - the components - has been addressed beautifully, with a gorgeous board that replaces the old charts, as well. The reduced playing time is welcome, as the feel of the game remains almost exactly the same. This is how updates should be done - great job Friedemann! ****UPDATE 8/13/04*** Open mouth, remove foot - that's what happens when you judge a game based on only a couple of plays, especially one with the depth of Power Grid. With Funkenschlag, I found myself enjoying the game more each time I played it. Power Grid is just the oposite. With each play I see more things I just don't like about the game, most notably its pace. Unfortunately, I doubt I'll convince my group to return to the aesthetically inferior, but gameplay-superior Funkenschlag. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

A rather dry theme; you buy power plants, build a network of cities and provide them with electricity. It certainly is a fun challange to do so effectivly though.

Love the bidding rules, it's always fun to watch other players agonize as they try to decide to bid for a powerplant or not.

The rules to avoid runaway leader are nice to, making the leader go first on auctions for power plants but last when buying suplies and conecting to cities. Perhaps the most balanced game I own.

Ok . . . instantly one of my favorite games.  Once again, I think I like complex strategy with limited unecessary detail.  The mechanics here all help to balance out the game, and they work so well that by over emphasizing your stratgy, you actually tilt the game play in the favor of other players . . . just a brilliantly concieved game.

Although the mechanics have unique twists, these differences exist for a purpose . . . that is . . . to balance the game.  

Now that I've played this 30 some times, it is losing a little luster.  I know which plants to buy, and when.  Also, the game sometimes boils down to a count fest.  Also, the occational run on resources is something that I've learned to watch for.  Still a great game, but others are catching my eye more often.  With it on the web, I don't tend to pick it out at gaming events.

A very nice auction game, although takes a session or two to understand how the game works.

Extra maps really aren't necessary, as you have plenty of replay value and variance from the base game. They do add some interesting tweaks to the rules though, and thematically it's fun to "visit another country" after you've played the base map a few times.

Power Grid is an excellent economic, resource management, network-building game with some auctioning thrown in for good measure.

Power Grid has been labeled 'Mathy', and it is, but the math skills involved are those that every adult needs: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and the ability to budget. Application of these skills is not so heavy that playing Power Grid becomes a chore, and for most players will be 2nd nature. By the end of the game's 2+ hours though it will feel like everyone has gotten some brain exercise.

There is a flaw in the game though: In Step 1 it is possible to cut one or several players off from expanding their grids. This can really slow the game down and cause those players to abandon hope of competing in the rest of the game.

Although the board is too busy, the rest of Power Grid's artwork is clean and reminiscent of Tintin comics. I will not be upgrading to the Deluxe Edition specifically because the new art-style is terrible.

Power Grid is worthy of its high ranking on BGG.com. Its not a 'fun' game, but definitely is a good one.

RATING: 9
Deep engaging strategy game.  Auction off power plants to power your cities, buy resources that vary in market value, broaden your city limits, power your cities, earn cash from powering, rinse and repeat.  

This game is so finely tuned many games are lost because people are one dollar short of doing something that will take them out of the game.  A bit unforgiving, so for people that must win it could be frustrating.  Engaging game though, that really is fun and I am still learning about mistakes I am making 10-15 games deep.

For an auction euro, a longtime mainstay in the BGG Top 10, Power Grid still feels very much of the moment. While it feels unlike other FFs, the twist ending to the game (not money, not VPs) does indicate a different sort of mind behind it all.

RATING: 7.75
Awesome game; I just wish it had more replay value. Once you know how to play then you pretty much just apply the same strategy each time. The mechanics of this game, however, are the definition of polish and genius. So simple conceptually and plays beautifully. If there was more variation between games then this would go from a 7.75 to 9 for me.

Man, oh man, the competitive streak comes out of me in spades here.  The tight auctions, the perpetual question of the horserace (are you the type who leads out the gate, or who sprints in the final stretch), the relative lack of AP --  it's pretty damn close to perfect for me.

Corrected.  It IS perfect for me.  Almost a decade later, still perfect for me.

Buy power plants in the auction phase, and buy fuel for them, buy houses and power them up in the action phase which earns money, that you recycle in the process. Once you bought a certain number of houses the player who can power up the most with his available power plants will win. The game is about planning efficiently for the last round. Highest rated game on BGG from the year 2004.

Power Grid is really popular, and I can see why - it's pure strategy, with victory or defeat hanging on the edge of a single dollar. The money mechanics are deep and the strategy really difficult. On the other hand, to me it was kind of a one-trick pony and it's trick just wasn't really my thing. It's most significant sin, in my opinion, is that its mechanics aren't deep enough for the long play time, especially since it becomes obvious to some players how the game's going to turn out long before it does.

A mathy auction/economic game. It's a good game, but a little bit too much calculating and recalculating for my taste.

The player-driven resource market is elegant, if a little fiddly on occasion.

I dislike the overt punish-the-leader mechanics that result in what I call the "Power Grid two-step", where players alternate between being last and first.

Lots of math. Still, fun to figure out the best choices of plant, resources and cities. You need to carefully think about how valuable each plant/resource/city is to you. You don't want to spend unnecessarily. Keep in the mind the value and availability of the resources when buying plants.

Theme and artwork fit game nicely and game mechanics feel good. I like ending condition of the game. Overall the game is very good but for me you need a bit too much of raw (exact) calculations of how much you have money / how much you can spend / etc. It is just enough to take a bit too much fun out of the game. A very good economic game but too much of wrong type of brain burning.

I don't like that much maths in a game (honestly adding connexion costs is boring), and penalty for first players is a bit too violent.

I am surprised that a game that is this light and this much fun made it into the Top 10. It is delightful little romp into the land of Power Plants, Fuel Types, and City Powering Operations. The cool thing about this one is the fact that the game mechanisms do not get in the way of play, but actually help to facilitate it. The choices are often tough, but those serve to make the game interesting. A must have in any collection.

Power Grid is good and engaging game. It is rather easy to learn but difficult to master. It does not take long to play which is nice.

Strategic game that my group really enjoys playing.  I've never won, but I've always felt like a contender.  I really like the balancing how it's not always best to be in first as you'll be subject to the more expensive costs for resources after everyone else buys the cheap stuff.

RATING: 9
Best with 4 or more players, but lacks a little intensity with any less. When I analyse Power Grid I always find myself wanting to rate it lower. Initially it seems counter-intuitive with clunky balancing mechanisms. Then there is the fiddly maintenance each round. And finally there's the laborious task of calculating your spending each turn. However, when I start playing these reservations soon fade. After a few plays it becomes more intuitive and you realise the turn order and the phases are a big part of the game's appeal. With some experience the game flies along and the calculations make for a really tense end game. Final scores are usually very close with a few micro decisions having a big impact. I always have a great time when playing Power Grid and would find it very hard to drop it's rating below a 9. (7)

In questo gioco c'è molto: aste, piazzamento, gestione delle risorse. Forse è un gioco un po' troppo per calcolatori ma comunque avvincente. Non mi piacciono i vari tabelloni (anche quelli delle varie espansioni) un po' caotici e brutti a prima vista. Tra le varie mappe consiglio l'Italia, ingolfata ma chiara e strategica, e il Giappone (con possibilità di partire da due siti differenti). Nella versione originale troviamo le carte Stati Uniti e Germania: di queste due prediligo decisamente la seconda.

RATING: 9
My personal favorite. This has 3 moderately simple mechanics that blend well together. Each of the various maps adds a new flavor and challenge. Can be played with 2-6, but really needs at least 3 players for the auction portion to work right. Can be a bit "mathy".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.8
I can't for the life of me understand the enduring popularity of this one. To anyone with any sense of profit and risk it's reduced to merely making the right decision at the auction phase and a lot of bean-counting. The phase transitions are too uneven, and the game finish invariably seems to be deeply unsatisfying. Plus, there's niggling rule alterations depending on how many players you have, which strikes of poor design. The board is plain ugly, and there's no box insert! Not even a poorly-designed one! Shameful!

Okay, My wife and i had a learning game... here's the deal.. we learned it... now we understand it... and we're ready to kick some ass.

the turn order is super!!!... if you have never played this, basically the game self corrects it self to prevent someone from getting a huge lead (like mario cart).. so basically you need to have a good strategy so that you can be in position to win, when the time comes. 

and if you really suck... at least you'll not be left in the dust...

this game is cool... and it seems that the different maps keept the game fresh...

i still need to play it more, but this seems like a keeper!!!

This is the type of game you can really get your teeth into. It looks like a connection game, and it is partly, but is more about money and resource management.

Love this game, but always end up really tired. It's easy to play but incredibly hard to win (when playing against good players) because it's so well balanced that if you are leading then you have a great disadvantage cause you buy more expensive resources and are the last to build.

Once we came to a point where, while out of resources, if one player ended the game, then the other would win and so the other way around, so the game was a "tie", something that was not supposed to happen often but could with some combinations of centrals in the leading two players. Other than that, it's great.

Great game. When you get the mechanic, it's amazing. The most remarkable is how the economy moves. The problem is the replayability because it's always the same map; so you'll need to buy more. It would be great to have a modular map (even if it's not from a real place).

Calculating skills are crucial. There's however only little dynamics in this game (or have just never played with the right people?). With 3 players, the game doesn't attract me at all. Havent played with 4 or more players yet.

UPDATE 08/2012
Still haven't played it with more than 3 players - because I just don't want to play that thing and never suggested it. I also must say that I find the thematic execution strange. The resource market is cool, really! The "railway track" building, on the other hand, isn't. If the power plants were located somewhere on the map, that would be different...

After I got to play it a second time it was a game I knew I would love to own, but at the time I didn't think it would go over well with my wife and older daughter. It has been a hit with my wife and older daughter and comes out a few times a year on family game night!

When I first started playing this game I was disapointed in how much mathematics is involved in making your network.  But the game penalizes those who are ahead in the game just enough to keep this game interesting.  Also, the element of luck exists in which power plants come up for auction.  Having a luck element is important to me.  Without it, I don't enjoy games as much.  If playing with other experienced players who don't take too much time figuring out their moves, this game is really enjoyable.  Although it can be a bit anti-climatic.

I am never sure what to think about this game when I play it. I can't tell if its deep or too luck based. We play so seldomly that I guess its not so deep afterall. 10/28/14: played this again and lost to a 12 year old. Did i make some mistakes yes? was I outplayed probably. This is a fun game, but it really makes it hard to pull way ahead, which i suppose is intended. My biggest gripe is the randomness of the board, it seems awful to start over in the center of the US board in say Omaha or Duluth. The cities are spread out the connectors are expensive. The two front runners started on the east coast and both seemed to be trading first and second throughout the game.

2006.  Spellenbeurs in Essen.  Ik had mijn lijst vooraf opgemaakt en bovenaan stond Funkenschlag (ook bekend onder de naam Power Grid).  Nog nooit gespeeld, maar wat surfen op websites leerde me dat dit wel eens een topper kon zijn.  Geen spel voor doetjes, maar een stevige klepper die voor de nodige uitdagingen en strategien kon zorgen. 
De verwachtingen waren dan ook hoog gespannen.  Sommigen zetten Funkenschlag bovenaan hun lijstje, naast Puerto Rico en Caylus.  Wat zoekwerk leverde uiteindelijk een 3-tal verschillende vertalingen op (met dank aan www.boardgamegeek.com) en ik kon meteen aan de slag.  De speluitleg is duidelijk (hoewel niet correct vertaald vanuit het duits) en na een 2-tal rondes valt het spelsysteem duidelijk in zijn plooi en wordt het 'routine'.  Maar vergis je niet, elke stap of zet kan belangrijk zijn.  De doos bevat een aantal houten stukjes (huizen in 6 verschillende kleuren en grondstoffen in verschillende vormen en kleuren) een aantal kaartjes met energiecentrales, geld en een dubbelzijdig spelbord.  Het spelbord heeft aan de ene zijde een landkaart van Duitsland en aan de andere zijde Amerika.  Die landkaart is verdeeld in verschillende zones, met elk heelwat steden die onderling verbonden zijn met pijpleidingen.  De bedoeling is om jou steden met elkaar te verbinden en die te voorzien van elektriciteit.  Zo kan je geld verdienen, en opnieuw investeren in nieuwe, betere energiecentrales (max. 3 per speler),  Wie als eerste een aantal steden heeft verbonden (bij 5 spelers is dit +15) en die ook allemaal van energie kan voorzien, wint dit spel.  Het leuke is dat iedereen bezig is met zijn strategie, of beter gezegd met de aanpassing daarvan.  Niet elke stad kan zomaar op zijn netwerk aangesloten worden, meer nog: dat kost geld, veel geld.  Maar hoe meer centrales en aangesloten steden, hoe meer inkomsten.
Toch nog een woordje over de layout.  Een grote doos, omwille van het spelbord, wordt onderaan niet opgevuld met materiaal.  Spijtig, want wat opbergvakjes zou dit spel nog aantrekkelijker maken.  Wat ik ook mis, is een schermpje.  Alles is van belang: wie welke centrales heeft, welke grondstoffen hij daarvoor nodig heeft, maar ook hoeveel geld die nog in handen heeft.  Een klein schermpje is handig om zijn geld daarachter weg te stoppen.  Niets dan lof over de cover van de doos: de tekening in de jaren 50-stijl doet het wel, alleen nog de vraag of centrales op uranium, windkrachtcentrales en fusiecentrales toen al bestonden.
Helaas was de spellendoos die ik kochte niet volledig (4 kolen ontbraken).  Ik heb dan ook een tijdje terug de uitgeverij gecontacteerd, tot nog toe zonder resultaat.  Ik blijf hopen dat 2FSpiele me alsnog de ontbrekende stukjes opstuurt.

RATING: 7.75
Strategic! A game I really enjoy...but just don't have enough players to play when time permits...Wait...not anymore...the new 2-player expansion "the Robots" saves the day. A game that sat on the shelf virtually unplayed for far too long, now comes to the table much more often. Many claim this is a game in the gateway category. I still have to disagree, the length of play and complexity of calculations all make it a bit more of a Medium heavy game for our game group. Games typically take 3 or 4 hours to play. Games like Ticket to Ride, Pandemic, 7 Wonders, Dominion, Settlers of Catan are definite games that easily bring non-gamers into the hobby. This game is really the next step up. I would place it amongst games like Puerto Rico, Agricola, Twilight Struggle etc.

This is a very tight game. The auctioning for power plants is fun and tricky. The market of goods is predictable, but not too predictable. Should I stock pile goods early or should I wait until they are cheaper. Should I buy that glorious new garbage plant this turn or wait...there are two other players holding garbage plants right now, maybe I should get the Coal Plant and diversify my goods selection for the future. So many choices and tough decisions. But then there is the board, I need to be building cities to make money. Do I buy a power plant, goods or cities...tough and fun decisions every game. 

One interesting dichotomy is first player vs. last player. In this game the first player has a significant penalty at times when buying a new power plant. Sometimes nothing good is available and you will have to risk auctioning something you don't really want or pass for the entire round. Also, in buying resources, as first player you will be choosing last from the leftover resources in the market. Costs will be higher inevitably. Holding back a little with building sometimes allows you to be in a better place for better prices. 

The mechanics, board and components are all great quality. Color blind players do have some trouble with colors at times in this game. The expansion boards are all unique to the countries they represent and have minor adjustments to the setup of the game and usually the goods market.

Great!  So much to balance each turn.  Value of plant to you vs. value of plant to opponents, value of new plant vs. immediate new connections, value of new connections vs. stockpiling cheaper resources, probable moves/purchases of your opponent that will alter those values next turn...  

My wife said she liked it better than El Grande.  (Not quite there for me, but still great.)  I am looking forward to playing with different regions and different maps--another great feature of the game!  

Finally tried 2-player and we were pleasantly surprised.  Plays great, although it is almost impossible to build a sizable lead.

Tried 6-player and liked it OK.  All the new players had fun.  It slows down the game, but it ends in fewer turns and the plant auction was not as competitive with the lower victory condition.  This may not be a problem with a more experienced group gunning for a victory beyond the 14 cities required.  WE found that the SW (the blue area) is not viable at all if the NW (the purple area) is excluded.  That is probably true for all numbers of players.

Played 3 times. Once in person and 2 times on BSW.
Lost all 3 games. : ( This game is about precise calculation! The auction part adds tremendous value to this game. Sometimes during the game one has to fall behind to get an edge. Simple rules, but deeeeeep.
My brain hurt after playing. Definitely a true gamer's game, and a great game! Deserves a 10! But to be honest I'm less likely to be in the mood playing it unless my mind is crystal clear and relaxed and feels like giving my brain some hard-core workout. 

So I'm only giving it a 8. 
But definitely deserve a 10 if I'm smarter. :)

Power Grid has great replayability due to the fluctuating fuel demand, which leads to different levels of demand for each power station, which has a feedback effect on fuel demand, etc.

Combine that with the geographical element (placing houses) and the jockeying for turn order position and unusual victory condition and you have a great game.

The rule book is difficult to learn from, so my first game was a bit of a struggle, but after you've played it once it is much easier. Expansions further increase the replayability but are by no means essential. It's also an easy game to teach, as only one player needs to know the fiddly rules, so it's a good "next step" to try with casual gamers.

Jun 2010: This was my favourite game at one point (for at least a couple of years), but more recently (since 2008) I have got slightly bored with PG and don't play it as much. I'm always up for a game if someone brings their copy, but I'm not likely to put my own copy in my game bag when there are so many other games I'd prefer to play.

The guys were discussing PowerGrid based on its  BoardGameGeek reviews. I saw a copy on sale - bought it - and never looked back. 

Another great bidding/economic game (along with Medici and Cuba) to keep the group happy.

We find the games very competitive. Our group prefers 5-6 players. The only modification we've made is to play with poker chips (much nicer than the 'electro' notes supplied)

Worked surprisingly well with two players.  Would still like to try with more as it seems it would be even better.  There is a nice blend of slight area control, resource management/hoarding, and auctioning.  I like that you have to double think whether you should end the game or not, trying to work out the math if someone can catch you in doing so.

50+ plays. This game has seen tremendous replay over the years. With experienced players, the game can often come down to a decision you make towards the end of the game - whether to bale out of a high priced auction in the hope that (as the last player) the new card flipped will be big enough to suit you and you'll get it cheaply. The game is rich with auction and purchase decisions throughout however. I think one of the main attractions is the nice leapfrog feel it provides, as you surge ahead to get cheap buildings on the board, or fall behind to get best choice of power stations and cheap goods. Very few games have captured it, and it induces a strategic feel which is appealing. They myriad of expansions provide minor tweaks to the rules and provide enough variety for those who need it. This will be in the rotation for years to come. It's only downside is that too many games get decided by the chicken-out decision - do I big higher on this ok card because the next card is going to be crap and I can't afford to wait any longer to build my capacity, or will I get lucky with the next card and get something even better and potentially game-winning for cheaper?

Fantastic! This IS my favorite game! I love playing this, though I rarely win. So many elements about this game, yet it boils down to a sortof neck-and-neck horserace to the end. Many oddities about turn order and auctions rotation in the game turn away a few people, but it is these very oddities which I and many love about Power Grid.

Heavy replayability through different maps, varied regions played, number of players, auctions, and promo cards.

Best to learn how to play from someone directly. Plan on about 30+ minutes per player for the game time; much more if a learning game.

RATING: 5
What I like:
- Auction mechanic (although I prefer the once-around format)
- The way the resource market loosely models supply and demand
- Theme
- Graphic design and art on the power plant tiles is gorgeous and very functional

What I don't like:
- The turn order mechanic, which should be a minor part of the game, is the primary focus of the game
- The rules force a lot of contention on the map (I prefer "friendlier" games).
- The winning condition seems artificial and "gamey", and puts too much emphasis on the final round.
- The stages are horrible, resulting in stalls and spurts of activity.
- The ability to completely deplete resources, preventing your opponents from firing those plants
- Length (it should be a 60-90 minute game--and on BSW it is)
- The BSW UI does not allow you unclick a building if you change your mind!
- Graphical design and artwork on the map is neither thematic (pipes???) nor functional.

The 3.3 weight seems a bit high. I'll go 3.1. You definitely have to be ok running a lot of addition in your head. I can imagine a lot of AP with some players.

It's not a bad game, but aside from being a bit long and overdone for my tastes, it just doesn't work for me. After my first game, I wanted more. After 4 more plays on BSW, I think I'm done. The game has too many drawbacks to overcome its appealing elements. Specifically, the jockeying for turn order dominates the game, whereas I want the game to be about powering cities.

This is the portuguese edition of Power Grid and I totally love it! Haven't played it before but it is just the kind of game I love to play. Heavy Euro-style game! I think the supply/demand mechanism of the energy supply market works fantastic!

Then there is also the interesting auction and the network building all in one game with elegant and very functional rules! Great stuff FF!

- Not sure if it's the portuguese translation of the rules or the usual mess which FF makes of it, but once again... Rules are not very clear, difficult to mentally structure, but once you master these rules, the game is not difficult to explain, but difficult to master! :) AWSOME Challenge!

Teaching this one takes a little time, but when the game hits that stride and things start to pick up, it's exhilarating. It deserves every good word it gets. Be warned, though- Allow around an hour to teach it to a full table (with their goofing around). This is not a game to wheel out for the short-attention-span crowd. Block out a good chunk of time to play, and recruit dedicated, focused players to play with.

Don't be put off by the box (which looks like a game my parents would have played as kids), there's a really good game here. Parts that appeal to me are the varied map so games are different in play and the random selection of plants all meaning each game is different. Expandable as well there's an awful amount of game play here before it could ever get stale.As to the game itself, it's finely balanced for 3 plus players, easy to learn, close and competitive - a real winner

Never has a game plummeted so far in my estimation - a couple of dull, by the numbers games and what seemed to promise so much suddenly feels formulaic in play. The maps don't seem to offer much novelty (Steam does that so much better) and the card game release sort of proves that for me - it's not about route planning

Yes this game as many have said can feel like you are doing accounting homework, but I still love playing it. The auctions, board position, and resource management all come together in one brilliant package. The rules are not well written or organized so watching a video or downloading a rewrite of the rules is highly recommended. The deck of power plants features several plants in the medium range that are not worth buying so the power plant deck expansion is also recommended. It is easy to screw up the steps needed to manage the plant deck during the game, so attention to detail is needed. But once you have the flow down, the game is quite smooth.

RATING: 8
This game takes some concentration, but it is worth it.  Lots of arithmetic is involved as you add up the prices of resources to see whether you can power all of your plants, and then again when you add up the cost of connecting new cities to your grid.  How much can you afford to bid on the new power plant you need?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
I thoroughly enjoy every aspect of this game.  So much time can be spent planning the next move that there is never a dull moment in any turn.  The downside is players are thus often susceptible to AP, but since every player experiences it at about the same time it's usually not noticed.  An excellent game.

If you don't love obsessing over how and when to spend fake money you won't like this game. Me, I love it. Always gets massively tense towards the end.

Durante l'adolescenza ci portavamo Risiko in campeggio. Probabilmente oggi il gioco sarebbe Power Grid. Friedemann Friese sfrutta un tema insolito, apparentemente poco interessante, e crea un capolavoro grazie a un mix di meccaniche semplici ma ben azzeccate unite a una bellissima veste grafica (dell'artista-feticcio Lars-Arne "Maura" Kalusky).
L'asta, che da il via alla corsa tecnologica, regala momenti di ilarità quando qualcuno fa il passo più lungo della gamba (comprando centrali che lo fanno rimanere senza soldi). Il mercato delle risorse è un piccolo capolavoro della progettazione di boardgame: un esempio perfetto della dinamica domanda-offerta. Senza dadi, il fattore culo è quasi del tutto azzerato: sei responsabile di ogni stupidaggine che fai. Osservatori superficiali bollano Power Grid come gioco con poca interazione: con avversari esperti la vittoria si costruisce non solo scegliendo il tracciato più economico ma ostacolando aste, esaurendo risorse agli avversari e "murando" le loro vie di espansione.
Un gioco estremamente longevo: l'ordine di uscita delle centrali (unica concessione al Caso) rende ogni partita unica. Mai fatte due partite uguali. Concludendo, uno dei migliori boardgame a cui abbia mai giocato: da giocare e rigiocare all'infinito (anche grazie alle numerosissime mappe a disposizione).

Really great game - the supply/demand mechanic is excellent. Turns can feel a little bit repetitive (buy houses, buy goods, repeat), but there's plenty of strategy. I find it's tough on newbies though because the end of the game typically sneaks up on them. It's tough to learn when the last turn might be right around the corner.

Cool game incorporating resource management, auctions, and network control (i.e. like a train game). 

I am finally realizing why I don't love this as much as I should.  I mean I love economic 'train' games.  But I don't  love the scoring in Power Grid. The endgame conditions seem arbitrary.  It doesn't feel right.  Give me a Winsome game, where the winner is the one with the most money.

It took me a few plays to warm up to Power Grid, but the power plant auction is such an interesting motivator for the rest of the game.  Now it's one of my favorites.

RATING: 9
The economics of the game are a lot of fun. The resources you need change over time as well as resources other players need. This can increase or decrease costs uniquely to each game played. You also have some territory grabbing like Settlers of Catan, Money distribution based on territory akin to Risk's army distribution, and Improvement bidding like Monopoly's property auction.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I really love how the power plant market works, everyone ends up with different plants, and how they behave for the rest of the game depends on which plants they get.  You need to simultaneously try to work toward end-game plant capacity, while at the same time trying to get the cheap cities before others do, while trying not to jump out in front of everyone.  I love the art, too.  My only complaint is that if you get significantly behind the curve, you probably won't be able to catch up even with the turn order helping you out.

Great game, but one mistake can doom you.  Lots of simple math required to make a decent move.  With fewer players it can suffer from the power plant draw.

RATING: 6
A good time... played twice with 3 players, once with 5. Having lost all three, the 3 player games to a total rookie.

 Update: Okay, I won a 4-player game finally. It was won on tie-break, and some of the subtley of this one is starting to appear.

This game is pretty heavy. It takes quite a bit of concentration. It is somewhat fiddly. You must have someone who knows the rules WELL to teach it, as there are many phases and card turns that you can get wrong in the heat of a game thumbing through the rules.

It's good, but it's high rating surprises me (3rd all-time as of 10/24), especially due to it's length. Will certainly appeal to the groups that enjoy the other top rated games (PR, PoF, E&T).

12/17 okay, are there any MORE strategies to learn in this game? We had our first game with the "7-stall" plant effect, and my opponent bought 11 power plants in one turn, powered 13 of them, and won. He had over 230 bucks on that turn - we never saw it coming. 3/06: This came out multiple times at our biggest event of the year, and I had no desire to get in and play. Partly because I don't enjoy seeing newbies get crushed, partly because I didn't want to get hosed by a newbie's poor play, partly because... I'd rather play PR, or San Juan, or a bunch of other solid Euros. New maps interest me slightly. In one year this is going to be a 5.

Pros:
+Fun theme even though it doesn't look like it would be at first.
+Pretty easy rules to explain. Not a ton of little details to explain.
+Beautiful board and cards have a fun, light artwork on them.
+Moderate length of playtime.
+Very strategic.
+A slight bit of screwage, but can be overcome unlike Settlers.

Cons:
-Tough for new people to win. Learning the balancing act of springing forward to first player takes a few games.
-Paper money sucks.
-Some plants are pretty worthless.
-Can cause AP in some players.

An excellent auction-economy game, where you power cities in various areas of the world. Players have to balance money, income, resources and turn order as well and emerge as the most successful electric company. The game simulates in a very clever way the supply vs demand in the resource market, as well as the increase of prices when the demand's high.

Plays greatly with 3-4 players, 2-player version interesting as well, but the auctions lose their power as the game's key element.

TRY Jun/04 (BSW, as Funkenschlag): good fun, even if the parts are disjointed (auction for plants, purchasing of limited goods at varying prices, extension of power lines to new cities, and decision of how many lines to power).

Very nice that it handles changes from 2 thru 6 players easily, and comes with 2 different boards (USA, Europe).

Power Grid was an easier game to learn than I was expecting, and a lot of fun. Definitely less dry than some of the brain-burner Euros I've tried before too. I liked this one.

Update February 2014

I still enjoy playing, but the phase 2 stall, followed by the player who breaks it almost inevitably losing, and then the calculation that's necessary towards the end all take the shine off slightly.

A masterpiece. I truly enjoy every game of Power Grid.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
EDIT: From an 8 to a 7.5

Strange game: the rules are fiddly and takes some time to get in to. And a game explainer that have not played Power Grid an awful lot, has a busy time introducing it to PG-newcomers and at the same time remembering all the steps and turns, refuelling resources, once-used-rules and card manipulation throughout the game. 

But you know what - this game is very intuitive and most non gamers/casual gamers I played with found it very logical and easy to comprehend. People that were still a bit confused by mid-game the first time they played Pillars, thought PG was crystal clear. And if you don't play with people afraid of doing a sub-optimal move, the game is exciting and will not drag that much. 

It is a bit on the dry side, but with a couple of beers and friends that challenge you in the bidding of plants you will have a good time. The building and buying resources phase is also great moments when you interfere directly with each other. 

Don't be alarmed by the weight rating on BGG if you prefer somewhat lighter games. Sure, it is a difficult game to master and it takes some time to learn it by the rule book, but with a good game explainer (that also manages the cards) the game is closer to Hacienda/Thurn and Taxis in weight than Puerto Rico/Imperial (Ok, PG is a bit meatier than T&T, but it is also a lot more intuitive). 

Only downside is that slight repetitive feel that sometimes occur, a couple of times in the game you also feel that there is not much interesting plants to buy. The game is also a bit "to long for what it is". Still, good to decent replay value.

OK... this is a great game. I'm new to it but as I get into it more I like it more. But, it really helps to be good at math if you want to quickly calculate how much you can spend for power plant, cities, resources each round to decide what to do each round.

The fluctuating commodity price market mechanic works brilliantly. 

The variable power plant efficiency makes the auction phase interesting and provides differing strategies that can lead to success.

The end-game condition provides the opportunity for a come from behind victory, allows players to control the tempo of the game somewhat and puts the cash flow/power generation versus network building phases of the game into a nice balance.

Well deserving of its lofty place in the BGG rankings.

RATING: 9
Combines nicely auction and resource management. The art of the gaming board is beautiful and the cards follow. It may take a while to see where it would be best to locate your first houses, but after this the only problem is the other players. In this game, a fellow player can do a lot of harm to the others. Block their building routes or bid higher on auctions... At the end of the game we had a lot of calculating the most optimum places. It was hell, but maybe it's because of these games that I can still count without calculator.
Definitely a game which a true gamer would appreciate. I like it too, but I need more games to give my final opinion!
Looks good though.

Good game, not sure I agree with the comments that I have seen about being too mathy, okay you have to balance your power station purchases with your fuel needs, but you can always tell who is going to need what fuel, (plus how much they can hold/purchase) and from your turn postion what is the maximum the fuel you'll need will cost.

Good economics game, though much more maths heavy than Age of Steam.
In AoS you only add numbers like 1,2,3 whereas in this game you add 17,31,24 and ~12-15 for resources. Ouch, if you are a bit tired from a few beers.
Best part with this game is how you should avoid being in the lead! Avoid being in the lead at all cost but still play good enough so that you have enough money and a good board position for the great final. Usually the last turn someone builds plants in a lot of cities.
The America map is not as good. It is too expensive to connect the western and eastern parts of the map. So those starting at different coasts never meet.

Well, the best game we have played so far. Thought settlers was good. But I find Powergrid is even better and very less depends on luck (except perhaps whether you have a comfortable seat or not). You have to balance a lot of things and also find out a neat way to expand your city base. Always go for the maximum. You will love this game even if you loose it. Best thing is I keep winning most of the time. I have come of age as a gamer with this game.

Ah, Power Grid. It took a couple of plays to actually understand the rules, which we found kind of confusing, and play everything correctly. At first, I found the game somewhat tedious and slow.

No game deserves a perfect 10, because no game is perfect. This game isn't perfect (maybe) but it does deserve the 10.
Why? Not because it ticks all the right boxes for me (it does), not because the theme is strong (it's very good), but because of it's interaction. All the things other players do affect you in a meaningful way. I have no trouble in keeping track of what the other players do, in this game it just comes naturally. And that really helps in making decisions, It's even fun to be outplayed, because you can easily follow wthat's going on. If you win this game, you know why. And if you lose, you also know why and probably even what you need to do next time to avoid it. 
And then the next game, you'll learn again.. 

This game is great. Surprisingly, I really hate all the other FF games I've played.

(1 play)  It's a very mathematical, calculating game with a great theme.  I can't quite place it, but the turn order that encourages last place until the end is a little frustrating.  The games seems to be about relative pacing against your opponents more than building an infrastructure.  Maybe that's cool... but it was unexpected.

I like network building, economy building, civ type games and this is one of the best - just as long as I don't want to spend my accumulated wealth on an army to wipe my opponents off the map!
I'm not a great fan of auction games but the auction in Power Grid works well. It allows the cost of a power plant to vary depending on the map, current resource availability, and how many cities each player needs to power and I find that I can calculate a maximum price to pay. With most auction games I find that I am just guessing an amount, usually the wrong one.
To stop me getting bored, there are different combinations of networks on each map, a different game as the number of players changes (although I'm not happy with 2-player) and the power plant availability changes as well. Then there are new maps with small changes to make things interesting but no need to work through the interactions of half a dozen different expansions.
I don't own this but I do keep my friend, who does own it, supplied with new maps.

I can see why many would like this game. However, it has the same problem of Colosseum. Most auctions aren't auctions, simply because what anyone wants is normally radically different from the other player's present goals. Any elevation beyond that is primarily 'screwage', or another form of pushing one's luck to dimish another player's returns for acting on their intended strategy. Yes, auctions are a good mechanic, but not when they're used ONLY and SPECIFICALLY for this purpose. I never felt as though more than one player genuinely needed the same factory, simply because the game dictates that you need to pursue the factory types that no one else is going for. The game design itself ruins the auction mechanic, in my mind.

Painfully dry.  It's basically a weighted graph of profit opportunities you purchase and maintain by spending different resources at rates dependent on the efficiency of the cards you've bought at auction.

Have only played the new version, and I love it. This game officially rocks.  There's an exquisite amount of decision-making, all nicely streamlined.  Little amount of AP, lots of tough decisions.  I must admit, though, I get impatient when people playing for the first time make bad decisions.  I don't yell at them or anything, I just curse in my brain.  I particularly enjoy the timing that has to be made on the final charge.

Intresting game. I do not know what strategy to use to win. However, a little too much of repetative mechanichal steps in each turn. Perhaps is the fluctuating price at the market too small to make it really important for the game outcome.

After first play, impressions are familiar:  a little dry on the theme, but lots of interesting decisions to make.  The market mechanism is inspired.  Not sure I quite understand why it's rated so high.

My absolute favourite game. Even with all the flaws people point to I enjoy this game every time I play. The extra maps and power plant deck just ensure that I'll have a hard time getting bored with this one.

I really like this game and I want to like it more.  I think it is a game that always has legs and it is always interesting but it just feels clunky and there feels like there is a lot of bookkeeping. The rules booklet is beyond bad.  I would gather most people play it wrong if they don't come to BGG or have someone explain it to them.  It is a game I enjoy in some ways more online than on the board because it is faster and I don't have to do any bookeeping.

Update: Use the new plant cards! They do alot for the game, although the endgame balance problem is still there.

---------------------------
Very interesting game with some minor flaws. The way factories come up by chance sometimes give big swings on game balance, this is especially annoying during the endgame were a plant timely popping up can be heaven or hell - and you cannot prepare for/against that at all. Otherwise a very enjoyable game.

RATING: 10
This is my favorite game.  far superior to puerto rico.  If you think it's not a good two player game, you're playing it wrong.  it may not be as good with two as it is with 4 or 5, but it scales better than any other multiple player game.  With 6 people, it's a little short, so i would avoid that route until they release and extended rule set for the new deck.  with 6 maps, and only a select portion of the maps in play each game, it is sure to be different every time.

RATING: 7
Refined rules, and an interesting management of resources, plants, and auctions. But it feels a little dry at times (the last two turns make me feel like I need a calculator!) However, I can see why people enjoy this game, since there is little randomness to it.The auction mechanic is quite good and the rules are straightforward.

RATING: 7
Nice game, but there just seems to not be a lot of excitement... at all.  You better count every single dollar you own and plan every expense during your turn and take into account your next move: the game is designed to keep players on a tight rope of expanding and supplying with a single dollars often being what is missing to make that extra purchase. Despite this frequent  annoyance, I found it ok. I'm glad I own it and will play it from time to time, but it will never become my personal top ten favorite since players strategies are kept on a very tight leech that is dependent on bidding.

I am happy I got to try this one. It is a very good design, and the variety of different maps with different rules gives it some longevity. For a very simple set of rules, I can see how this one would be very enjoyable after many plays, since each game situation will be different and intervention from other players would change the playing field.

Another great game in my opinion. Makes it onto the table almost as often as Caylus. Great mechanics help this one to the top, and interesting gameplay and different maps lend a good variety to the game. The strict economic focus and need to multitask with respect to expanding your network, buying resources, and upgrading plants makes the game interesting while allowing it to keep focus. The "last goes first" concept also really helps players to keep from trailing for too long.

This is what euros are all about; Power Grid defines a truly elegant gaming experience.  The rules are remarkably streamlined, and after a couple of rounds, it's pretty easy to get into the groove.  The only random element are the power plant cards; like my other favorites, success depends on balancing your major plans while also being flexible when things go awry.  

I've only played with 4 or 5 so far; both have been excellent.  Maybe not the best gateway game, but a must for gamers with even a little euro experience.

Great resource/economic management game with networking building elements. Bought it mainly because I got a really sweet deal on the Portuguese version for 25€ with shipping cost included. My only criticism regarding the game is that I don't find the way you expand your cities to be much relevant (give or take 5 elektros here and there) since you end up having to occupy most of the spaces available on the board. Also I've had a couple of games with lots of dead rounds mid game where none of the plants mattered to anyone which caused everyone to just hoard up on money until decent plants came along or we hit phase 3. Those dead rounds when they happen are enough to kill the game and make it feel like a chore.

Really, really loathe this game.  For starters, there's very little player interaction (auctions don't really count).  It's entirely possible for one person to get a lucky auction that the other players can't (or didn't) bid up, so that person will win the game aand no one can possibly influence that.  I'm still a little surprised that people play this for fun; it's like competative billpaying that you win by being the last person to pay your pay-per-view fees.

Definately time to update the words on Power Grid.

Flat out - a great game.  Lots of interaction, lots of decisions, lots of fun.  It's especially great to me that it's flexible with players.  I think the game would be a little better if the paper money were replaced with chips or something, but otherwise the components are good and plenty.  The game is part auction, part area of control, part empire building.  The theme goes hand in hand with the actual gameplay and components. Also:  a pretty good Euro-Introductory game from fans of A&A and Risk.  Will always be a great time when the PG comes out - but - doesn't see a lot of play in favour of newer games in my collection.

Extraordinary game, with an eye for decent amounts of realism.  Simple, well-thought out rules, but realize that it will take a lot of math to be good at this one (no calculus, just a lot of + and -).  The variable turn order makes players want to stick to the back, but not so far back that they can't catch up.  Very interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.61
Excellent game with many different elements that work together well. Clever rules concerning turn orders in various phases to maintain balance, and each player is kept involved through each phase (little down time).

Rules are actually fairly straightforward, although not all that well written, containing some poor word choices (steps/phases). It isn't very hard to teach new players. Everyone can understand the basics due to the well-integrated theme.

Scales well to various numbers of players & actually works fairly well with 2 players too (but with less competition for plants, resources & connections, particularly in the later part of the game).

Nice components & artwork. Double-sided map for extra variety.

For faster play with less fiddling I would definitely recommend using poker chips or similar instead of the paper money - especially small numbered chips that can easily be concealed in one hand!

Update: My fondness for this game has 'oscillated' over the years, but I think now I can settle on the facts that some of the fiddly management of the plant market and turn order, the unfamiliar calculations of placement and the 'increased cost' hampering means this will deter the casual players. However, I would be fine to make up the numbers amongst the fans of the design.

A connection game in which you pay to link and place buildings, and as a result of some unweildy maths this mechanic alone slows proceedings as players work out (and often ask others to help) the running costs. 

Yet despite this offputting element in the design there are other features which I still find interesting. First off is how power plants are auctioned off. Only the cheapest 4 in a display of 8 are up for bid, so the other 4 are a taste of what may come up next so long as an intervening value plant doesn't step into the top 4. This is a tense tease and I sometimes feel that the drawpile can screw a player over hoping for the fifth plant to move up. Is it a gamebreaker, I don't know yet.

Another interesting element is the turn order is determined by how far ahead a player has built, so that player bids or passes first in a round (so can't bid again). Also that player buys resources and builds last in a round which can get expensive, so all in all a neat catchup mechanism which I haven't seen elsewhere. There is some consideration in jockeying for the best position to set yourself up to build the required number of stations first. What is unique here is that although you may have built the required number, you need to have resources to qualify your score.

A great mix of resouce management and tight decision making.

A serious game for serious gamers. It is long, there is brain drain, there is some math, there is influencing other players(auction play), there is a lot to this game. It's mechanical functions are complex(who goes when, multiple turn segemtns for different elements of play, restocking the board, banking, etc.). You will not play it right the first time through I can almost assure you, it's learning curve is a near vertical wall. But if you like to press your brain to the grind stone, in an unforgiving game where your choices are the weight and luck is a minimal factor, I almost can't think of a better game. It's worth it. It's 10 in my book, but is hard to approach, so for the general public I got to drop a couple points.

One of the earliest games I played and it is still a favorite.

[b][u]What I like:[/u][/b]
I love the fluctuating commodities market and the increasing efficiency of the power plants. The struggle for finding maximum efficiency while competing over limited resources is what is so enticing about PG.

[b][u]What I dislike:[/u][/b]
I think most people would agree that the phase changes are a bit wonky. 

[b][u]Overall:[/u][/b]
I can understand the arguments against Power Grid (PG) such as the game is a bit disjointed and there is some tedium in the fiddly phase changes. Despite all of arguments against PG, it is still a great game. I have tried to collect every board.

One of the best games. Would have received a 10 if it weren't for the end game. A bit too much luck involved in who is getting which powerplant at the end, thus deciding who is going to win. So I love the game, but usually get very frustrated with the end.

Awesome game! Lots of tension in every step. Will I win the power plant I want in the auction? Will there be any oil left in the market, and if there is can I afford it? Will someone build me into a corner? 

Every game is different... I've had games where the price of fuel was high throughout the game, and others where everyone went green and the prices staid low. 

The only downside is the mind-numbingly bad manual, but you can download some great payer aids that make the game go much quicker.

A 'must have' game.

P: 2-6, T: 1-2 hr, SdJ-R

+Great Gateway: easily teachable. Very minor luck elements, game play feels entirely driven by player decisions and markets. Player position mechanic keeps every game fairly close to the end; new players aren't punished until they learn the rules. Multiple maps and power plants keep things variable through multiple plays

=Not too cutthroat, but some can get frustrated by blocking. Little direct interaction, more passive aggressive competition

-Not as good with 2 players (robots expansion may improve this) Power plant availability and auctions can seem like the only real pivotal decisions. It's nice to have a calculator nearby

FF's masterpiece for most people is well appreciated by my group.  The art is a little one-note compared to games like Landlord and Funny Friends (probably by necessity), and it has a few rules that are fiddly and easy to forget, but the game is rock solid and can create some really great tension between players. Shame they departed from the "F" nomenclature for this game, too.  Makes my collection look weird.   
Overall, Power Grid is an undeniable triumph, but I like FF more when he's exploring weird corners of the gaming universe rather than making vanilla-style Euros.

Lots of arithmetic but captures the theme well.  Some of the new maps are worth picking up if you play this often. I prefer this with about 4 players because that ensures that several (random and hidden) power plants are not used, which makes every game different in ways that are not clear from the outset.

I'm tempted to say that this game is over-rated, but I don't think that would be fair.  This game does an excellent job at what it's trying to do, and I can't think of any other game that scratches the same itch. 

For beginners the problem is that the endgame seems way too sudden.  With experience, players start to recognize what the endgame looks like, and this problem becomes negligible.

For veterans, on the other hand, the problem is the static map.  Cancelling out a particular region only adds limited variability, and soon everybody knows the strongest board positions.  Fortunately, this can be solved with official and unofficial expansions, if you're willing to invest the time and/or money.

RATING: 7.5
A solid multi-faceted euro with a bit too much mental calculation for my taste. I like the auction for power plants, and how it ties in to the subtle struggle for the best turn order position. I also like the fuel market, with its simulation of supply and demand and the interaction it forces between the players. I don't particularly like the main board though. Usually I enjoy having a spatial aspect to gameplay, but it doesn't feel like it adds all that much, and I find myself constantly adding up multiples of 5 to optimize my network on the board. Making it worse is the fact that many of the numbers you need to read from the board are pretty small, and the money you're using to pay for all the calculated costs is flimsy paper money that is annoying to deal with. I can see why the game is so highly regarded, but its annoyances mean it's not top-tier for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Nice auction, supply&demand game. Only two things bother me about it. 1. The resource costs are fairly linear and not significant enough to influence ones actions (up through 4 players). 2. Power Grids (in the US anyway) are not deployed via underground pipes. Transmission is nearly universally overhead while Distribution (intracity) is a mix of underground and overhead.

Had a chance to try a variant which was much more aggressive (new plant cards) - renewed my interest in this game.

9 - Power Grid has for several years been a game I just "never got around to" because the theme didn't interest me much. I received it during the BGG Secret Santa and got a few plays in a realized it's a super amazing game.

RATING: 8
Classic Euro design that combines resource management, tough decision making, bidding, screwage, and ease of play with scalability (2-player suffers a bit from  the 'rich-get-richer' effect and the bidding doesn't work well with only 2) and variations in playing areas on each side of the 2-sided board. (I still manage to mess up the victory conditions almost every time I've played.)
Note: Ill-considered starting placement in multiplayer games can almost assure some players will never have a chance to win.
Note2: German map starting positions are far too unbalanced. Need to try the US map again. Maybe some of the other maps are much better balanced.
Note: I can't seem to figure out a way to win.

Power Grid is a fun game for up to 6 players that involes buying power plants and providing electricity to your cities.  There is an excellent economic market in this game and players have to balance buying power plants, buying resources to fuel those plants, and then knowing how many of their cities to power (to get income).  I really enjoy this game.

What a great game. No wonder it's #2 on the gaming list of BGG. OK for a two player game, but it's better to be played with more than two players. The raw material mechanism systeme to activate your power plant is awsome.
The material is a little bit dark, specially the power plant cards and could be improved

Quel bon jeu. A la première partie on comprend la cote de #2 sur le palmarèse des jeux de BGG. Le jeu est OK pour une configuration à deux joueurs mais sa configuration se prête à des parties de trois joueurs et plus. Le mécanisme d'achat des matières qui activent les centrales électriques est géniale. Le matériel de jeu est un peu drabe, spécialement les cartes de centrales et aurait intéret à être modifié.

RATING: 9
People crap on this game for being too "mathy", but that's the one aspect I really enjoy. The only randomness is what order the power plants come out of the deck in, and it affects everyone equally. Thus, the interaction between players during each phase of the game is what drives people to play differently, not luck. It does encourage players to take a "screw you" approach to hosing people out of resources or connections, but I'd rather have that than getting hosed by RNG.

There are a few problems with the game, but they're mostly map-specific. For example, the US map is really awful with more than ~4 people, because being forced to start on the west coast (which you more or less have to do going last in a 6-person game) pretty much guarantees a loss. So play Germany if you have a lot of people. Also, the power plants can be very lopsided in strength: the hybrid (coal/oil) plants are so much better than the others because you can pick and choose between the two cheapest resource markets.

If you're able, try looking at Power Grid Deluxe where these issues were at the very least addressed. I haven't played it enough to tell if the changes are strictly better, but they definitely do improve the experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
An okay game, I found it way too long, especially towards the end when it comes down to number crunching and you pretty much loose touch with what is going on around you, at least I did. I does not help that the theme ins painfully dull and boring. Still, one of the better Euros out there. I cannot help but think that the game will play pretty similar every time as the natural balance of progression in this game is pretty linear and you will never have many tactical options and usually one obvious strategy to go for in each round and that is something I find rather uninteresting.

What surprised me after not playing this after six years is how relatively light this game is compared to Euros of today!

I played two 2-player games with my non-gamer aunt and cousin to teach them the rules. It went surprisingly smoothly! Now I think I'm more confident suggesting this game others new to Euro games!

Now, to me Power Grid is just a card drafting game!

Upgraded from 5 to 6.

2009-04-28: I tried this game again with six players, the new deck of power plants, the expansion board that features The Netherlands, and alternate rules that shorten the game.

I preferred this game over my last playing because the game did not drag at all.

It seems that the winner is the one who doesn't screw up rather than cleverly manipulating your opponents.

Way of screwing up:
* Paying way too much for a power plant
* Choosing a part of the board too hotly contested
* Ending up focusing on a commodity that everyone else wants.

What I like:
* The planning: It's a bit pathetic how I play this game. I require small bills so that I can group them into small piles representing each city I want to expand to, the commodities I want to buy, and my budget for my next power plant purchase.
* The way which power plans of increasing power come into the game.

What I don't like:
* The game's interaction is a bit too subtle for me. It's difficult to directly attack people in the lead. It's risky to attempt to screw an opponent over in the commodity market because that means you'll have to compete directly in the same commodity, which is risky. And it's difficult to effectively block opponents on the board (but that might change depending on the board you pick, and which sections you choose to include in the game)
* Personally, I don't like auction games very much.

The upside:
-The most perfect game I know even though it isn't the one I most like to play. It gets the higher rating because of that. It's because of how well it does everything it proposes to do and how everything seems so smoothly interlocked.
-Extremely inducer of table talk, threats, bluffing, like boardgames are suposed to.
-The resource market making you pay for your turn order sins, by changing princes accordingly to how much a resource is sought after.
-The range of power plants is enough to make several strategies work, either based on resource types, or resource quantities.
-The catch-up mechanisms.
-2 maps in the box provide somewhat different experiences.
-Selecting which areas to use in each game is also nice for replayability.

The downside:
-Mathy for those who have a problem with it. But its nothing really big and only become an issue later in the game.

Power Grid is ok.
It's decent.  It's fine.   There's room for skill and strategy, and a handfull of interesting decisions to make.
And yet... I was bored out of mind.  

The auctions that form the game's beating heart are banal and predictable, while the rest of the game boils down to simple arithmetic and action optimization.

After reading, hearing and seeing this game for YEARS and people going on and on about it being so balanced and perfect in design, I just knew that one day I would be disappointed in its gameplay.
Well, that day finally happened (4/16/11).
What shocks me is how blatant the flaws are in this game, and makes me wonder what the hell people are using as rating criteria for these games.
The powerplant track is by far the worst design flaw in Power Grid, since it so drastically affects the entire flow of the game - if all the plants are low numbers, than the game just CRAWLS to a halt, with multiple turns basically spinning wheels until someone wants to get that 7th city and trigger the 2nd stage and then get the privilege of being screwed by going last.

And that leads to the 2nd major flaw - it is SUCH a penalty to trigger the 2nd stage & go last, it's no wonder that people deliberately try to hang back and wait, building up their money reserves until the sucker triggers, and then they try to buy up everything in that mad dash after the 2nd stage is triggered. It reminds me of how in Colosseum, people didn't want to be in first place and did whatever they could to hang back - a clear design/pacing flaw.

The game is SO slow in buildup during the 1st stage, and then literally there's one turn in the 2nd stage!
Then there might be 1 turn in the 3rd stage, and the game is over!

That right there shows a SERIOUS pacing problem, that should have disqualified it from getting the ratings necessary to be #5 best game on BGG.

sidenote - I was VERY surprised to see the community-building exercise when buying cities in this competitive game. Since when do Euro players actually help the other players find the most efficient way to place their cities? I haven't seen that in ANY competitive game in MANY years of playing - what an odd side-aspect of Power Grid, that people view it as a collective puzzle!

Played the France board for my first game. Didn't fully understand the gameplay, especially the end game. I would have bid differently with what I know now.

played my second game on the USA board. Did a lot better than my first game, but it always seemed that I was a turn behind. Still not sure if it is my type of game, but I'll still be willing to play it.

3rd play was my worst game yet.

I finally won on my 4th game, on the German board. It was 4p, with one first timer. At the end it sort of came down to kingmaker, but any decisions made at the time would have swayed it between the top two. It actually could have ended before the 3rd Step started, but the next pull started it. The final auction phase was what determined the final outcome, which ended up being in my favor.

This is one of my favourite games in my boardgaming collection.

It has just the right amount of luck to keep things fresh and requires a LOT of skill to get good at.  As with many games that have multiple playing fields, you are constantly forced to change and reevaluate your strategy each game.

I openly agree that this is a wonderfully designed game, but it still feels a bit like filling your tax return in: lots of planning and adding, a bit of creative license, often not a lot of fun at the time, but rewarding at the end when you get some dosh back in your hand. 

I can only rate it a 6 though because my shoulders slump and my teeth grind when it is brought out (too often) at one of my gaming groups.

A well designed game that plays like a math puzzle. Unfortunately the lack of random elements or chances precludes any change of fortunes within the game.

This game is about efficiency, figuring out how much money are you going to spend each turn, but also keeping an eye on what your opponents are doing, because if you don't you will end up paying much more for building your network or fueling your power plants, because the prices on resources go up or down depending on the demand, which is a great mechanic in this game. 
This game would be very serious if it wasn't for the rest of fun mechanics in it, like the auction for power plants or the fact that the end game can be triggered at any time during step 3. Every time i have played this, i've had a lot of fun.

This is a tough game for beginners, but it's a great game overall.

When I first introduced my friends to this, it took a few plays to get the hang of it.  There are many exceptions to the rules that need to be followed correctly; don't be surprised if you find yourself missing rules the first few plays.

Once you get the hang of it, it seems so easy, yet it's very challenging.  At any given time there aren't too many decisions to make, but there's definitely a strategy to every one.  Do you make more cities and get more money or do you sacrifice money to get a good turn position?  Do you buy a less efficient plant now or hold out for another one later?  How long do you keep bidding on a heavily contested plant?  Do you buy out the resource market to block other players or do you buy only what you need to keep prices low and use your money to buy better plants and more cities?  Every decision matters, but you always have good visibility into what's happening at the moment on which to base your decision.

The only problem it has is that the math can be daunting.  Later turns can become long as players count up the cost of routes to buy cities and making sure they have left enough cash when buying plants and resources.  Turns can be slow and it may be a while before you get to play again.

All in all, it's a great strategy game with a strong theme.  It even has some subtle lessons to teach about long-term investment, competition, and scarcity of resources.  There is no king-making, no runaway leaders, and despite not having a lot of direct interaction between players, players are always interacting indirectly through the power plant, resource, and city markets.  It a competitive game, but I've never seen it cause fights like many other games (e.g. Settlers of Catan).

I highly recommend this game for anybody looking for a deep, challenging strategy.

I thought I'd enjoy this more than I did.  All of the people I played with had played before and they were very outspokenly critical of my moves.  Maybe it was because one player's rash moves can affect everyone's play more that they were so critical, but it left me with a bad experience of Power Grid.  I'd like to play it again with less hard core gamers or maybe even just a different set of people to see if my rating would change.

I thought I would really enjoy the turn order handicapping the person in the lead, but when I got into the game, it seemed artificial.  The people who were in the lead weren't really in the lead and they knew it.  Each player (the good players) spent more time playing the system than they did playing the opponents.  To me, it was a strange way to go about playing an auction game, even if it was effective.

******Update******

I raised my rating to a seven after a second play with a different set of players.  It improved because the people were more fun, but I've come up with other reasons that I'd prefer other games. Power Grid is too mean!  The best way to optimize in many cases is to ruin your opponents chances at doing anything worthwhile.  While many people dearly love this type of game, I absolutely don't.  

Also, I am someone who prefers games where it's okay to make split second decisions without calculating every little thing.  I am not someone who is generally AP prone.  Power Grid gives me AP.  I hate that feeling that everyone else wants me to hurry up and take a turn already.  I do see that it's a great game though and that many people find a lot to love about Power Grid.  If you are the sort of person who loves Power Grid, good for you!

Rating Lowered back to six because the thought of playing Power Grid kind of fills me with dread.

I like this game very much. The better you play early the more option you have near the end. But you need to be careful, rush for end of the game or buying all coal is a game-breaker. It creates a great balance between early game snowball and having a sliver of chance until the end. 

There is a lot of straight out counting and some people may not like it. There i a lot of clever ideas in this game and since you may play a phase 4-5 while some people will be at phase 2 and there is very little downtime even with 5-6 players.

I thought that I would not like Power Grid after my first play because the math was a little boring (I love math, but not so much in games).  But after a few plays, the math becomes automatic and a rich play experience envelops. It is enjoying to watch players change their strategy from game to game with regards to the auctions and pacing of the cities.  New players are a little scared to buy plants so the price will be low in these games, but as players develop, the plants change in value in the player's perspective as the hydro plant prices are driven higher.

After years of hiatus finally I managed to put this back onto the table and I found it way better than I remembered. Considering that I also used the game as a more serious gateway game for the newbies, it did its job perfectly. 
The rules are generally straightforward, except when it is not: some minor rules make this game difficult to teach, especially those involving the removal of most expensive/cheapest power plant card on the market and the different steps and their effects in the game. Plus, I also forgot, that the game actually ends when you purchase the right to power the 17th city (in a 4-player game anyway), not when you actually can power it. This casued a bit of a headache for us and also a bit of backtracking, so it was a bit annyoing for me. 
Somehow I hate to teach this game to the public. Although the basic rules are simple, these exceptions and always-changing small details make it difficult to oversee a game. 
But even after the first game in years I already can see, how intricate the system is and how the different layers of the game (especially how the player order is determined and how it effects everything) interlocking with one another. 
Also, the fluctuating prices AND the availability of the resources makes the game very intriguing: it was a freightful realization from me at the last round, that beiing in the first position, after I bought a coal-based power plant, my opponents actually could deny me the coal I needed. 
And I had a lot of these kind of aha moments: you are better prepared for the last rounds with sufficient power plant capacity, so that you don't depend on the mercy of a card flip. You also should have a coherent plan from the very beginning, so that you won't waste expensive resources when you discard an obsolate power plant from your tabloeu. Also, you should also keep an eye on the future market and keep in mind, how the market works - sometimes it is better to forgo buying a new power plant, when it just hands a better option to your opponents thereafter. 
Playing with and around the turn order track is difficult but very satisfying puzzle on itself and for me this is the most important mechanics, that elevates this game from simply beeing a good one to a great (and evergreen) one.

The last game of this I played was a great example of why I love the game.  I had chosen a very poor initial position, not realizing the link costs to escape it were quite as high as they really were (My own dumb fault) and so I was boxed in very early.  I had somewhat given up on the prospect of winning, but through rallying other players and doing all I could to control the winners possibilities through the manipulation of the fuel market, I was able to dig myself out of my hole.  When it was all said and done, the entire game ended up being a nail biter in which I was 2$ short of being able to build in a final city that would have given me the definitive win, and as it was, I got third!!!

What a great game!

Also, the new power plants deck is essential.

The theme is the first click for me in this game. 

The Market mechanic in this game is amazing, that Player interactive supply-demand market track. The Factory choice is also good, many ways to specialize your power usage. but The auction is okay, little bit luck-based. the cities building network is bit too mathy, You need to calculate every single spot if you need to maximize your ROI.  

I ranked this game so high up not because the gameplay itself, but the overall theme, mechanic and the use as learning tools about demand/supply, economic game that's great for introduction to anyone who interested in this stuff.

A good game, with a very nice built-in balancing act that helps prevent runaway winners. For some reason I don't enjoy it quite as much as most people seem to. It may be that I haven't thought about it carefully enough to appreciate its "story arc," the way that gameplay changes as the game progresses. It's definitely got story arc, but I usually get a feeling of "same-old-same-old" sometime during the second hour.

RATING: 6
This game doesn't hit the table very often, but when it does, it consumes a good three to five hours of your time. Every game of this I play has started to feel the same to me because you know you'll need power plants that add up to 17 (or preferably 18) and you know you'll have to power that many cities to have a chance at winning. Every game seems to end the same exact way in the sense that you are sooooooooo close to winning, but you get blocked from buying a city(or cities) you need to win by the player who will probably come in last place. 
I'm also not a big fan of auction games, but I will still play this one(and Biblios). Although, I feel like I reeeeealy need to be in the right kind of mood to want to play this. In the time it takes to play this game, I'd rather play four other games in that time frame. Long story short, I've grown sick of this game.

Superb resources-management game, perfectly spiced with a gnawing auction system that governs Power Plant purchases. Doesn't suffer from dangerous-looking "race leads", as precise money management opens the way for turning unfavorable tides. Excellent design and visuals, elegant rules. The only reason this game does not get an overall 10 is because I'll have a hard time playing it more than once a night. A game as good as this begs for two plays in sequence, but its unassuming depth (brain-burning factor) precludes this.

RATING: 8
A game that is less about efficiency than about timing, which is a bit weird for a business simulation but makes it an exciting game.  I think it is possible to play well and do clever things.  Such play is not invariably rewarded, mainly due to how the power plant cards fall in the auction round.  I find this acceptable as this is the only major randomness in the game and it injects considerable tension and fun, at the cost of making the ultimate winner be determined a bit randomly.  I am not convinced there is a run-away leader problem.

RATING: 7.46
Nice market mechanism to change to price of resources.  It's a little confrontational (you need to cut off your opponents, etc...).  All the elements of this game interact with each other making for interesting game dynamics.

In the games I've played, the winner seems to be determined by luck rather than superior game play.  I'm sure others won't agree, but all my games have been extremely close....anyone could have won.  Felt more like a coin flip than a triumph of superior strategy and gameplay.

Not as heavy as people would have you believe (though it's definitely not light). It's an awesome game. The supply and demand aspect is high and the auctioning is fun. Games definitely take a while and there is usually a lot of swearing and brow-furrowing, but in a good way.

RATING: 3
I was unimpressed with this game.  To counter act the "rich get richer" problem in most economic games the weaker players get so many advantages that the bicycle strategy of 'drafting' (being careful not to take the lead too early and taking advantage of another player's draft and jockeying for the lead at the last moment) plays a huge role in this game.  This bugs me on a game that 'simulates' energy policy.  It is also unrealistic, in that vast amount of the time, economies of scale favor the leader.

90% of the games victory conditions are decided in the last two turns.  This makes the early game is basically meaningless providing you don't fall vastly behind.  (And this is not hard to do.)  So effectively, you could start in the mid-game with no loss.  Not good design.

The game is so unrealistic in other respects (for example, you could increase the cost of uranium 100 times and the price of nuclear power would increase by 1%) that it is a turn off if I want to introduce someone to a game on energy policy.  There is no penalty for power plants that produce CO2, (which will be driving the change to cleaner power plants in the near future), which is another critical failure of the game.

Another problem is the game does not play well with 3 players.

The game does have some nice points.  I do like the mechanics of how older power plants have to be replaced, which feels very natural.

I really enjoy this game.  The decisions each round are tough, but not too difficult to think through - a fine line for a game to walk, and I think Power Grid does it nicely.  Beware of trying to bid up plants you don't want, however.  I got stuck two times last time I played and it destroyed my game.  

With more plays however, I have downgraded my rating slightly - I still think it's a great game, but I always feel that it goes a little longer than I'd like it to.  Maybe that's because I'm usually out of the running in those last few turns -- I'm sure to play this more, and I'll try and pinpoint that feeling some more.

Auctioning, network development, resource acquisition, and a tight balancing act to maximize the efficiency of limited resources and take ownership of the most strategic positions on the board. You must keep a close eye on what your opponents are doing and find ways to dissuade them from selecting the tiles you need most. Not nearly as complex as the poorly written/presented rules would indicate.

Power Grid was one of the first few games I played when introduced to modern board gaming.  It was a bit too much at the time.  Now, it's great.  People say this game is "mathy".  It's just basic arithmetic.  If you can add 20 + 7 + 20 + 5 then you can play this game just fine.

This game was more confrontational than I would have expected.  Not directly, but you will find yourself fighting for position on the map with other players.

I've found this game to be more fun with higher player counts - one of the few games I can say that about.  Generally I find fewer player counts makes for less down time, which keeps you involved more and ends up being a faster gaming experience.  Power Grid is one of the few that I think is better with 4+ players.

I should love this game.  I play games and figure out the odds on my dice rolls, optimize plays, etc., but I just can't get myself to like the game.  There's not enough strategy for me (there's usually just an optimal play, that's not strategy, that's just optimization), but maybe I just need a few more tries at it.

Update: A few more tries later and this game is starting to grow on me.  I think this is a better game with 4-5 people.  The bidding gets more interesting and staging your future turns with turn order, power plants, etc. has been more interesting.

Update 2: And now I own it :)

RATING: 10
My favourite game. Even after numerous plays, assigning different values on  power plants during auctions in dependence of the game state is most fun and never gets old. The whole ressource market and the goal to cost-efficiently generate power is just very thematic... and fun. 

Altough PG looks a bit like a train game, the map and expanding your network is only one and certainly not the main aspect of the game. Tightly connected to this is the turn order mechanism. Sure, turn order is really important in PG and you should consider not to expand too early and forego some income. I like how this is integrated  in  the gameplay and I prefer this very much over a separated auction or spending an action (as in many worker  placement games).

However, being efficient is only a means and not an end to the game, since PG has a very unique game end and victory condition (network size triggers  game end; winner is the biggest power supplier in the last round). From the mid game on you try to get into a good position to make a move for ending the game. This may be that as a leader you expand your network beyond your capacity and surprise your opponents with an early game end. Or you try to maximize your capacity, which often leads to fierce auctions in the last two rounds.

There are some overpowered plants (25&26), so a randomization of plants would make this game perfect for me (of course without making the game more fiddly ;)). This game can get mathy for AP prone players, who try to calculate everything down to the last electro. However, apart from auctioning very good plants in the beginning and the costs for your final 6-7 cities (tip: just look at the average costs per house), there is no need for big calculations. Many actions have a subtle but complex impact on the complete game state and a pure cost/benefit calculation could never grasp this. So play by intuition instead of calculation! 

The game has an incredible replayability, since each game depends on map setup (cheap or expensive connection costs) and even much more on the power plant draw (good plants in the beginning and then a stall or only mediocre plants in the beginning leading to a rather tight ressource market). In total this Euro really has it all. Thematic ressource conversion, turn order manipulation, map/network mechanisms, auctions, unique winning condition and some luck with the power plant card draw (which may be even removed by the variant to reveal the top most card of the power plant deck).

When it was first suggested to me would I like to play a game revolving around running a power company, building up your infrastructure, and powering up cities, I was already taking a few steps backwards. When I was informed, "Oh, it's a German game", I started looking for cutlery lying around to stab myself to death.

Despite my initial reservations, Power Grid is currently my favourite multiplayer (2+) game because of how the theme and mechanics work seemlessly to produce a clean, streamlined and fun game with a good balance of strategy and interaction, and being engaged during other players turns.

Have played several times recently with my wife and 7 year old son.  It's interesting and has little downtime.  I love screwing over the people that come after me when buying resources.

The switch between Rounds is a bit clunky at first, but gets smoother after a couple plays.

Everything seems pretty balanced, as well.  I wonder how long it took to get that way...

Good fun and am usually willing to play - I guess that's the BGG definition of a 7.

(9/15/07) - Purchased

(1/30/07) - [9] - After three plays on BSW I finally understand the rules and have experienced the game. This is a game unlike any of the others I own. The theme and gameplay integrate with each other flawlessly. Specifically, you need to run your grid at maximum efficiency or you will lag behind your rivals. The resource market is amazing in that it is simple, but accurately depicts swings in the demand for a certain good and the subsequent price shift. While there is a lot more math in this game that anything I've ever played, it does not detract from the game's brilliance. Playing on BSW is especially enjoyable because of the reduced time for a game and the system taking care of the boring stuff like placing resources and shuffling out plants. This game deserves its place in the Top 10!

(7/21/08) - [7] - Further plays of this has warranted a re-rating. While this is still a good game, it doesn't feel as mind-blowing as it once was. Maybe my tastes have changed, or I've found other games I enjoy more. Either way, I'm dropping my rating to a 7.

I think that this game is a perfect example of a "6".  I like it, and it really gets the gamer side of my brain going but it has its downsides.  First is game length.  Clocking in at 2 hours this can be a detriment if you want to get more than one game in on a short evening.  The second, and my main reason for making this a "6" and not a "7" are some pretty fiddly rules.  Take this card out, add this card to the bottom, if step 3 occurs during phase 2 do this, if no one purchases a plant do this, etc.  I'm sure that the rules won't seem AS fiddly with a few more games played, but trying to explain this (or trying to comprehend some of the ambiguous rules yourself) can be pretty daunting.  So, in conclusion, I like the game and will play it if I'm in the mood for something heavy and engaging, but wouldn't pull it out every game night.

this game is BRUTAL  a single city difference may as well be all other players doubling your score since it will likely come down to all players powering 15 cities and being within a few dollars of each other (this may be due to the other players being veterans that have played the game 30+ times more than I though)  if everyone has the same amount of experience it may be a bit more forgiving, but I really don't see it that way.

RATING: 7
By themselves the auction, resource, and building phases each play like unfinished kernels of other games, but they mesh together so well that the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts. 

The math involved is trivial, but the number of calculations required slows down the game.

Additionally, luck of the draw can significantly affect the outcome. I've often seen a player buy the most efficient and productive power plant available, only to have another, even more efficient plant replace it, which is promptly acquired for the minimum bid by the auction's last remaining participant.

So, does a player buy the most efficient plant available at the moment? Or abstain from the auction and hope a better one becomes available?

What's nice about empire-building games is the story you play out--poor little company starts with meagre resources and manages in time to create a congromerate spanning the continent.  It's kind of like life--that expensive guitar you really wanted when you were in college, you now can afford easily, and it's nice to see how far you've developed over the years.  That's the Joy of Power Grid.

Power Grid is free of many drawbacks typically associated with empire-building games:  (relatively) short playing time, no long waits between actions, no runaway leader, fairly simple rules (particularly if someone else is handling the power plant market).  On the minus side, there is more adding up of little numbers than I can comfortably handle.  Arithmetically-challenged individuals may wish to use a calculator with the game.  (I realize it may be hard to convince non-gamers that a game that involves using a calculator can be fun!  But you may wish to try--it seems to be a perfectly fine game for the analytically-minded, engineer-type non-gamer.)

Enjoyment is also due to the interesting things that are going on in the economic model: market-driven fuel shortages and surpluses, sporadic (but partly predictable) progress in  technology, the stepwise deregulation of the power grid.  Also, each link in the chain needed to supply electricity has its own interesting quirks (fuel prices are volatile, the available power plants  improve over time, the power grid must be developed with an eye on logistics).  Though it's a lot of little pieces, both in terms of rules and the amount of thinking required, it's all quite intuitive.  All the little pieces mesh together well to make a satisfying full dinner of a game.

OMSCHRIJVING: Sterk strategisch-mathematisch, economisch bordspel.
De spelers zijn energieleveranciers in een wedloop om zoveel mogelijk steden van elektriciteit te voorzien. Investeren ze hoofdzakelijk in energiecentrales die elektriciteit opwekken uit steenkool, olie, bio-afval of kern-energie? Of kiezen ze toch liever voor meer ecologisch verantwoorde windenergie? Elke spelronde worden er nieuwe energiecentrales verkocht aan de hoogste bieder (als die er is). Wie uiteindelijk het meeste steden ook effectief van energie kan voorzien, wint het spel.

i like this game cept for 2 things - 1) the lack of incentive for anyone to build past 7 cities - u build and everyone else benefits from cheap houses. and 2) the end game - game ends suddenly and in a big anticlimax

Very fun!... once you know how to play it. There are several steps to each turn and who goes first depends on who’s winning, so there’s a lot of upkeep each round. Once you get the mechanics of the game down (took us a couple plays without too much time in between), it’s a fun strategy game that’s designed incredibly to keep everyone neck-and-neck to the end. Definitely recommended, but for more serious board gamers.

Power Grid is a straight-forward economic management game. The challenge of the game is to find a solid balance between having the best power plants or having the advantage in auctions and resources. Its a heavy number-crunching game, but if that's your thing, then sign up for Power Grid.

To add to the whole package, Power Grid is also just fun to look at! This game has a really cool look to it that sets it apart from other board games.

There is very little I don't love about this game. I love the way the market works, the power plants, future market, balance of building routes and powering cities, money management, auctions, player turn order, limited building options which expand as the game goes on, plenty of strategy interlocking with tactics, ability to complicate things for other players without direct conflict... everything I like about games is here- all in one package. I have some minor issues with this game, mostly because I played Funkenshlag several times before and I like some of the elements from it a little better- specifically drawing and planning out routes from city to city, and a more robust Step 3- but overall I'll take the more streamlined Power Grid. There isn't much at all I'd change in this game. If only the game was shorter so I could get it on the table more often.

Updated and down-graded. After 20 plus plays it just wasn't going anywhere for me. Fond memories for sure, but the underlying need to manage your cash all the time isn't enough fun to keep me coming back for more.

The only "top 10 game" I play regularly. Appeals to a wide cross-section of my regular gaming circle. Probably the only economic game I actually find fun, mostly due to the market and auction mechanisms that can give games very different feels. More like a cycle race than an exercise in accountancy. Who's got anything left in the tank for the final dash? We like to play loud and trashy.

A nice balance of several items - auction, resource management, area control (line extension), turn order management, etc.  The timing of what to do and when plays a key part in the progress of the game.

Tries to improve Funkenschlag but makes several key errors:
-  The payout chart is too rich, which allows fuel to be hoarded & sold out (something which can unfairly toss the game to other players.)  It also means instead of 3 phases in the original, too often the has extremely short 2nd & 3rd phases, because players have enough income to build to several cities per round. 
-  The removal route building takes away some tactical touches--how to build to retain access to cities you'll need later.
-  The US map is highly unbalanced.

FUN! now i own a custom resource set and a ton of maps. i can't get enough of this game! FUN!! it's actually surprising to see i only have 10 plays because i recommend it eeevery week. i think part of my drive to purge my (admittedly creaking) shelf of lesser games is so that there are fewer things between me and my next game of Power Grid.

I like the mostly non-random nature of it.  The first few times it takes a long time, but experienced players go quickly, and 2-player (we play that way at home, though it's not as good 2-player, and most people seem to not like it at all 2-player) is often under an hour.

But gameplay is longer than I prefer with a large group, or with newbies.  And newbies can be lose terribly from a single early mistake, then suffer for a long time.  Game length and its not being as good for 2-player is the main reason I don't rate it even higher.  It's a very cool interesting game.

Wow is this sucker swing-y on the fist few plays! Somehow Power Grid is one of those uncommon titles which has steadily risen in my appreciation which each of my first few plays. The first 1-2 games are obviously about discovering that the whole is about positioning for the endgame, and that's not entirely satisfying. But once that is a known factor, the remainder of the game oddly gains in interest. I'm eager to attempt other maps as well as play more.

One of the most enjoyable games out there, imo. Players purchase power plants and the necessary fuel and then build networks of cities across America. Earn more and more Electro bucks by powering more and more cities. More money means you can purchase additional power plants or upgrade existing ones. Be careful because the price of coal, oil, garbage and uranium changes with supply and demand! Pretty easy to learn and lots of fun to play with some clever nuances you will only figure out after a couple of plays.

One of the classic economic games, with a mixture of auction, market management, and area control.  I'm not a fan of the randomness of plant draws during the auction and how much the game focuses on vying for lower places on the turn order, but that's just part of the game - it's often better to hold back mid-game in city building, wait to get a really good plant and then bust out with lots of cities.  If you like this, I strongly recommend Wealth of Nations.

Not exactly a "fun" game, in order to play this properly meticulous calculations are needed.  Despite its heavy tones, Power Grid delivers a unique experience both in terms of game play and theme.

If you and 3-5 friends are looking for a serious challenge, then Power Grid is the board game for you.

--2Sept2004--  Has much of the feel of a long-distance bicycle race.  The fellow in the lead has the disadvantage, and there's a sprint to the finish after a short while of husbanding the energy for the final push.  Nice dynamics.
--Oct2006-- Demoted to 7 on comparison with its peers; it still seems that there's too much fiddliness (and this from someone that likes Antiquity!) for the payoff.

reddit comment: "I haven't played it recently but I love Power Grid. In Power Grid you take the role of the owner of a power company trying to power more cities than your competitors. The number of cities you can power depends on the size of your power plant. During the auction phase, you engage in out-bidding your competitors for ownership of larger power plants. Additionally, your power plants are powered by a variety of fuel. Some fuels are more scarce than others which leads to tension as players race for control of the fuel.
I recommend playing with poker chips instead of the paper money that it comes with."

There's a lot to like in this game - some very clever mechanics actually - but somehow this doesn't really speak to me. 

Don't know whether it is due to theme, artwork or the fact that this makes me feel like I am in math class again(constantly adding numbers to find the best possible route between cities).

The turn order mechanism seems to take a bit to get my head wrapped around because you are essentially getting punished for the thing that causes you to win. Instead, you hover around the back of the pack waiting for the opportune time to slingshot ahead. At least, that's my experience so far.  It reminds me of Dominion in that way, which I don't care for for the same reason. I didn't really enjoy my first play, but the second play was markedly better. I think this is a game that could use a few more plays before I know for sure how I feel about it.

Az általam ismert legjobb stratégiai játék. Hihetetlenül jól modellezi a valóságot (a kereslet hatásai hogyan változtatják a nyersanyag árakat), gyönyörű (bár egyesek szerint "ipari") a kivitelezése. Végig nagyon szoros a verseny, köszönhetően a mechanizmusba rejtett "esélykiegyenlítés"-nek.
Egyfolytában topon kell lenni agyilag, és egy számológépet sem árt bekészíteni játék során, de remek szórakozást nyújt a hosszúnak mondható játékideje ellenére is (amely azonban minden percét megéri).

Truly great resource management game. I suppose I would have preferred a bit more balance of the game board, rather than just slapping down some numbers and assuming that player interaction will balance it all out. Don't get me wrong, the player interaction does a pretty good job of balance, but its not perfect, and often leads to a player "having" to start in a location with another player just so that other player doesn't get a starting location that is too awesome.

Excellent resource management game.  It's interesting how different technologies become more or less affordable over time, both through the advancment of the plant deck, the change in resource supply though the different phases, and the actions of other players.  I'm finding the US/GE map is starting to get a little dry after so many plays, but the expansion maps offer new challenges.

RATING: 4
6/30/09 - played a game with 6. The subtleties of the game come out with larger groups. More bidding and fighting for space, more power plants come through, and also more strategy about purposely NOT buying power plants... still have yet to play more than the first step of the game though. 21 cities seems like it would take 6 hours or so.


1/1/09 -I don't hate the game, but I have NO idea why it is rated so highly. There aren't enough things to do and it is kind of obvious what is going to happen most of the time. bleh. It is somewhat fun when I play, but don't even have an urge to try and get people to play it.

This is an okay game.  It might have been a combination of player count (5), length (3hours) and the fact that everyone else had played before.  I did like the auction mechanic to get power plants, but this is a game that is not friendly to brand new players.  I will give this another go at some point, but I have removed it from my want to play list and no longer have a desire to own it.

This game just gets better each time we play it.  Remarkably tight, keeps the scare up, plenty of ways to affect the outcome of the game.  The production quality is sufficient but not plush, but let's face it -- you buy Power Grid to play the game, not admire the pieces.  This is just plain a good game.

Late Update -- after playing many more game titles, it is becoming apparent to me that the throttling mechanisms in Power Grid control the game too much.  Poor players often finish in the money due to the deadly embrace of two players that played significantly better in the first half of the game.  That's all part of the mix, but in PG I think the level of control exerted by the rules is a significant percentage of the level of control exerted by the player's actions.  Therefore I'm docking my prior rating by a full point.

The undisputed champion of most fun game with my gaming group.  We play it more often than any other.  This game almost makes you want to be in last place the entire time until the end.  It's funny to watch everyone outdoing everyone else trying to stay back so resources can be bought for less and cities can be placed first, until near the end when it becomes time to power up the most cities for the win.  This game keeps everyone in it 'til the end - the balancing mechanism of the game is flawless.  

I have played this game many many times, and I still love it and want to play it again.

Very cool market/economy mechanic.  The bidding is a cool feature, too.  Great artwork, high-quality components.  Lousy inner box, but that's di rigeur anymore.  Box is also an odd size, and the board is kinda big--not overly so.  Some of the translations and so forth from the original German are (predictably) lousy, but that only made it more entertaining, and are all fairly minor.  We really liked this one quite a bit!!

Sometimes you play a game so much that all of its little eccentricities stop being liabilities and start being assets. This is how Power Grid is to me. In the Venn diagram between me and all of my gaming buddies, the trashers, the Euro players, Power Grid is the game that lies closest to the middle. Sure there's some arithmetic, but you're managing a power company, what did you expect? Sure the turn order mechanic is gamey and an obvious catch-up tool, but knowing that creates some amazing subtleties between players. 

And besides that it's the kind of game that opens up with every play. It requires you to play with your eyes up, watching the other players. It forces you to plan several moves ahead, since the best move now could be catastrophic down the road. It's the sort of game where literally every dollar counts, and every decisions will produce consequences, both good and bad, that you will have to live with. It's my favorite economic game, one of the best there is.

I liked this game at first, but it only holds up for maybe half a dozen plays. After that, they all start feeling the same. It has no strategic depth. It's all about valuating available power plants versus other players' demand for fuels, with nothing in the way of long-term choices to make. I much prefer games where you can commit to very different strategies that give you enormously different values to your possible choices and where past choices accumulate, leading to specialization (shipping vs trading+building in Puerto Rico, for example).

I really enjoy the way the varied mechanisms come together in this game. Each of them feels like a necessary part of the whole, rather than tacked-on complications. I especially appreciate the system that governs plant auctions and market updates. The major issue I had with this game seemed to come largely from players - those in particular who spent ten or more minutes calculating their future moves down to the dollar. Certainly a viable strategy, but one that derails an otherwise well-paced game.

I won on my first try, so that was not so bad. It's a decent game, but the balancing mechanisms seem to have little to do with reality, and I'm not sure how thrilling replaying it will be. 

There are strategic options to explore, but I'm not sure how many, and it is more than a bit "mathy" as someone else said. That moment near the end where everyone is making their final calculations is more enervating than energizing. Just not my kind of thrill I guess.

Today I played Power Grid for the first time. This is it. My second 10. What an elegant design, great resource management, fantastic victory condition.

Power Grid has players trying to power the most cities.  Power plants are auctioned off each turn, and each power plant consumes some number of some type of resource to power some number of cities.  Players buy power plants, "build" into cities, buy resources, and gain an income determined by the number of cities they power.  The first person to "build" into at least 14 cities triggers the end game, the winner being the person who powered the most cities (money being a tie breaker).

This game has an interesting negative feedback loop: the player in the lead acts first at auctioning off a power plant (usually the worst position), and acts last at building into cities and buying resources.  Resources have a sliding price, so the more that are purchased the more expensive they get.  Great depth of strategy, especially in balancing your income as money is only a tie-breaker.

RATING: 5
This is a Euro-style economics game more suited to those who are interested in numbers and wealth accumulation and distribution. It takes a couple of hours to play with 3-4 players, but can take longer with more players or with slower or new players. It is a very popular game, although I personally find it a bit too dry for my tastes. I prefer party games like Resistance/Dixit/Telestrations or broad interaction-based games, like Diplomacy, which power grid is not. The resource market is quite nifty (it mimicks a real market's supply and demand) and I like the components to the game (again, very Euro-style, wooden). The game initially comes with US/Germany maps, but I hear that the Benelux expansion is worth getting for a quick game or for new players. Worth getting if you are not me!

Great fun game. It is always different, as the power plants that come out are different each game. Lots of strategy involved, especially to be well placed in the turn order for different things. Highly recommended!

Funkenschlag with crayons: Auctions are fun. Buying resources is fun. Runaway leader problems can make it all a bit predictable if the game end is still a long way off. Plays very different with four than with five - there just doesn't seem to be the resource shortages. I'd really prefer a scaled down version playing to say 12 cities, with Settlers type roads on a proper board, less points on the board (to speed up game-play), lower value of power plants, etc. - all so it could be played in less than 90 minutes.

And then there was Power Grid. A great improvement with the pace vastly improved without having to draw on a board. My rating above is for Power Grid - which should have its own separate entry because it's just not the same game- while Funkenschlag is rated two points below this mainly due to its dragging length. I think the new double-sided board is great. Now a word about theme: I've had some gamers say to me that they think the theme of this game is very weak. My opinion is that this is one of the better theme matched to game system games out there. There's not many other themes you could paste on that would make much sense to me. (It's no Web of Power - which could really be a game about pizza franchises.) If fact, the game seems to do a very good job of simulating the power company deregulation that took place in the late 90's and first decade of this century. I look at each of the plants as smaller energy companies being swallowed up by the RWEs and the like as they gobble up the energy infrastructure and service contracts for cities and industry. I suppose there could be a gas and water expansion for Power Grid one day. I'd buy it.

After more plays I'm starting to think this should be rethemed as a cycling game - go out hard or stay at the back of the pack saving your energy and waiting for the perfect breakaway opportunity.

In any case, the sameness of each game has dropped this a point in my ratings after 15 games.

People use to like this one.  I like it too, but after some plays I have the sensation that most victories are decided in the setup phase, so the players are forced to play multiple rounds just to discover what they already knew, unless somebody makes a mistake.

RATING: 10
The ultimate gamer's game.  The rules are fairly short and this game has little chance.  The strategy is based ultimately around money, and hence resource management.  Auctions, knowing when to take the lead, and cutting off your opponent make this game more aggressive the more players are added.  Add to this the fact that falling behind early can really ruin your chances of winning, and you have a game that seems mean-spirited, but acts more like a light-hearted criterion race.  All-in-all, a well thought out bidding/buying war with plenty of strategy.

I think this game is fantastic, though am often disappointed with the conclusion, the openness of what everyone has (resources, money, cities) causes the end game to often be a player saying "look, I win".  I still love this game though for every turn prior to the last, and will play anytime.

I love how the subtleties of player order can affect your decisions. Moreover, one must try to predict if and when stalls in the power plants will come and how to prepare for them. Finally, the game end conditions can add a lot of spice to the last couple of turns.

RATING: 8
I really enjoyed playing this, but I'm unsure if there's enough opportunity for people to overcome bad luck (or bad decisions) in the early game. It also seems the sort of game that will often end in a tie...which is okay and exciting once in a while, but frustrating if it's the norm. More playing should give me my answers to these concerns--and I'm happy to play and find out. [UPDATE: after more playings, this is rapidly losing ground in my estimation. From 8 to a 6.5.] [Traded for San Marco]
[Update 2: Okay, I played a couple of great games of this, and it's made me re-evaluate. While it's still incredibly fiddly, the "problems" I have with this seem to be no problem for me in Age of Steam. That's not fair to Power Grid. I think my initial instincts were correct: It's a very good game.]

I seem to like this one a little bit most of the others in my game group.  I think it's a very clever auction/strategic placement game.  The only problem, as I see it, is sometimes it gets a runaway leader problem.  But our games are usually pretty tight.  Some of my friends think it goes on just a tad longer than they want it to.

A tight economic game that requires good money management and smart building tactics. I can't imagine turning down a game.

The more I play it, though, I feel that the endgame is a little off. Powering the most cities feels like an odd way to win the game, like it doesn't match the rest of the game. I still really enjoy it, however. I guess I just get wrapped up in making the big bucks.

Hey, surprise! It also plays well with two. It's a different game, for sure, but it works great.

I have a tremendous amount of respect for this game.  The turn mechanisms are elegant, reasonably easy game play (provided you brought your slide rule) and the components are top notch.  My main gripe with it is that everytime I play it, it always feels exactly the same.  You have your plan, you're building your empire, then suddenly the dude who's been hanging back all day ends the game and wins.  And if you plan it just right, sometimes that dude is you.  Kind of a klunky ending to an otherwise fine game.

There's so much math in this game that it's about as fun as sitting through algebra class. There's not much interaction with other players in this game besides the auction phase, and with 2 players, that is short-lived. Not really much here that inspires me. I find this game boring.

RATING: 8
A game where all elements - auction, resource management, area control - come together.  Timing in each of your actions is key.  Do I bid more for this plant this turn, or save my money to expand and go for a (hopefully) better plant next time.  Build now or go for firing capacity.  Equally important is where you place that first plant, looking ahead to connections in upcoming turns - and the potential to block or be blocked - resulting in higher connections costs.  Plus, the all important impact on turn order as you must consider whether you want first crack at the plants or resources and building.

There is a reason this game is perched near the top of the BGG listings - it's damn good. My friend pointed out that the resource system doesn't actually mimic the actual system - if it did, the first player would always choose resources first, since money talks. I am glad that this isn't the case because it provides a nice, balanced game that never makes it impossible to get back into the running.

Dilemma.  This is a game that many players clearly love but I think it seriously flawed.  The market simulation is excellent, but the board and the clunkiness of many of the mechanics are a disaster.  It takes too long and the investment of time simply doesn't pay off.  (edit: Oh, and after a while the game almost always comes down to the cash-in-hand tie-break which is remarkably unsatisfying.)

This game is frustrating in that it encourages you to "hurry up and wait". I find the turn order nonsense annoying, the desire to not do anything frustrating, and the explosion of the endgame to be at once anticlimactic, and AP Central.

The general idea is cool, and the resource market is awesome, but I don't enjoy playing this game very much.

Failed to see the joy in this after one play. Hidden money and wheeling and dealing. Not exactly sure how much to bid. The last turn is tense, and by tense, I mean a lot of sitting around and bean-counting. A lot of "gaming the mechanisms".

Brass was "gaming the mechanisms" too, but that was fun, since there's an interesting system, This one has a lot of tiny, mis-matched elements (e.g. map that looks cool but isn't very interesting spatially, tiny dink-and-dunk costs) etc which other people say work beautifully together. I don't know.

RATING: 10
-a 2012 early Christmas gift for Zack from Julia-

OUR IMPRESSIONS: This is the best teen and adult friendly Euro-styled economic, auction/bidding, and resource management game we have played to date.  My wife Julia's favorite board game has always been Monopoly. She is the most calculating Monopoly player I have ever met.  Now, Power Grid is her favorite board game because it's everything Monopoly wishes it could be.  

As an economic gaming heavyweight, Power Grid's mechanics/components not only include cash currency (Elektro)and valued property cards (power plants) but also features painted wooden city tokens for route-building (i.e. Ticket to Ride), real estate auction/bidding/bluffing (i.e. For Sale), and a resource market with fluctuating costs for various energy commodities (painted wooden tokens as coal, oil, garbage, uranium) that require careful resource-management (i.e. Settlers of Catan).  Thematically, the game has an gritty electric aesthetic with crisp graphics that depict a gamut of energy production facilities: from fossil fuels, nuclear materials, and recycled waste, to emerging renewable resources like wind and solar power.  As a hefty Euro styled game with minimal luck involved and a narrative without violent conflict or player elimination, we find Power Grid to be very engaging, quite challenging, and overall more fun and replayable than mainstream 20th century American economic games like Monopoly, Life, Pit, or Pay-Day.

Of the 60+ games in our home, this is THE game that we go out of our way to plan ahead for and play together as husband and wife or with our gamer friends.  It's best played with 3 or more players but with the Power Grid: Robots expansion that adds "AI" 'robot' player(s), we can have the strategic depth and unpredictability of a 4-player game yet are able to play with only 2 human players (my wife and I).  

***

GAMEPLAY: The game is divided in duration by 3 overarching successive STEPS and in gameplay, each round consists of 5 sequential economic PHASES. The winner of the game is the one who succeeds in achieving the game's goal of powering the most cities built into your energy network by simultaneously owning the most efficient combination of power plants and having enough purchased raw materials in your resource supply to meet the economic demand for energy from the linked cities in your energy network. This sounds complex, and it can be at first, but the game flows very well in a consistent and calculating manner.  

STEP 1 is the opening step in the game and it's main function is to enforce a rule that a player may only build cities into their network if they are vacant for a cost of 10 elektro + the connection cost (the number value listed between adjacent cities on the map board).  

STEP 2 is initiated after a player builds the prescribed number of cities and thus adds more intensity and higher costs/risks/rewards for the players. Instead of building only in vacant cities, now players may build into single occupancy cities to make them double occupancy for an increased cost of 15 elektro + the connection cost. 

STEP 3 is the final endgame process that is initiated after the STEP 3 card is drawn from the Power Plant deck in between rounds or during the Phase 2 bidding/auction process. In STEP 3, the auction market from Steps 1-2 with the 4 lowest choices from 8 total plants arranged in descending order on display (the remaining 4 higher cost plants are the future market) is increased to a total of 6 plants available for bidding on the auction market with NO future market. Also at the end of each round in Phase 5, the lowest plant on the auction block is discarded and removed from the game, forcing frugal players to reconsider their strategy if they want to win. 

PHASE 1) DETERMINE PLAYER ORDER: First place player is the one who has presently built the most cities in their power plant network.  Note: First place position players do not always win the game after STEP 3 is initiated; some players tactically decide to be in last place during rounds in order to be the first to buy raw materials and build cities.  

PHASE 2) BUY POWER PLANT First place begins the Auction/Bidding process for acquiring/upgrading ONE more efficient power plants by spending one's Elektro. (Depending on the number or players, each player may only own and operate a maximum of 3-4 power plants during the game and must discard the least efficient plant from their energy network with each upgrade.) The game begins with each player having 50 Elektro for start-up costs.  The power plants range in minimum bids from 3-50 Elektro and can power from 1-7 cities using single or multiple types of raw materials purchased from the commodities market. Note: In Steps 1-2, there are 8 visible power plants on the market arranged in descending order of cost for a minimum bid. The 4 highest valued power plants are not yet up for auction but 

PHASE 3) BUY RAW MATERIALS: Last place is the first to purchase available energy resources from the commodities market using their accrued Elektro currency; each proceeding step in the game effects the surplus supply and costs due to the changing demand for each energy resource. Note: a player may only purchase up to a personal surplus of 200% raw materials of only what their owned power plants require. (i.e. if a player had a power plant that powered 3 cities for 2 coal, then the player can only purchase a maximum of 4 coal from the market.)

PHASE 4) BUILDING: Last place begins the process for building new cities into one's expanding power plant network; these cities are powered by the combination of purchased power plants from phase 2 and raw materials from phase 3.  Note: during the opening round, ALL players must purchase and power 1 or more cities. Also at the start of the game each player will choose to begin building their network in one unoccupied colored region on the map board; the number of players determines how many adjacent regions are accessible for the remainder of the game. In subsequent rounds, the building of one's cities in their own network will spill over into adjacent regions so long as their network is one continuous connection to the origin city selected in the first round of the game. Conflict in the game arises between players in the rare occasions when someone builds from an advantageous location near multiple adjacent cities of other players' regions; so I guess there can be a mechanic of area control in the STEP 1 rounds of gameplay at work.  

PHASE 5) BUREAUCRACY: This concluding phase is where risks/costs are rewarded with profits and the market for power plants and raw materials are adjusted accordingly with each succeeding STEP (from 1-3) in the game.   
- A) GET MONEY: Here, beginning with first place, each player decides how many cities they want to or are able to effectively power using their acquired power plants and raw materials at hand and thus, are rewarded with Elektro profits allocated according to the number of cities they decide to power. (i.e. if a player who had built 6 cities in their network, but only had a power plant that powered 4 cities for 2 oil, then they could only power 4 cities maximum, and discard 2 oil from their resource supply into the energy surplus pile and receive 54 Elektro in return according to the game's earnings chart.) Note: all used raw materials for powering cities are discarded back into a surplus pile.
- B) UPDATE POWER PLANT MARKET according to STEP 1, 2, or 3 that is in effect during the game.  In Steps 1-2 at the end of each round the highest power plant in the market is removed and placed back under the power plant card deck.  In Step 3, at the end of each round, the lowest power plant in the market is discarded and removed for the rest of the game.
- C) RESTOCK RAW MATERIALS in the resource marker according to the table listed on the back of the instruction manual (which also lists how many cities need to be built into a player's network to initiate the next STEP).  Each succeeding STEP has different ratios of return for depleting energy resources simulating the market effects of surplus, supply, cost, demand, and inflation/deflation as the raw materials components are placed and displayed on the resource market (see Phase 3) on the bottom/side of the map board.  The Round is now complete and go back to Phase 1 to resume gameplay until the game is complete.      

***

PROS: Power Grid is an excellent game for decision-making and strategic thinking skills. It requires maximum player involvement so that each person gets to work and play through until the its conclusion. It has a back-and-forth momentum from its mixed mechanics that allows a person in last place to have opportunities to gain fresh momentum that can change the pace or trajectory of each game.  The component quality is fantastic with hundreds of colorful painted wood pieces and a great double-sided board.  There are also multiple moderately priced expansion sets available as double-sided map boards of different geographic locations with new power plant cards and special localized rules.  My final pro is that this game seems to be unrivaled among other economic themed games and even among the heavier cult-hit Euro games we have played or heard about; it really stands out on our gameshelf and hasn't had the chance to collect any dust.

CONS: This is not a con from our perspective but it might be for others: there is minimal luck (if any) in this game; there are no dice, but only a shuffled deck of the remaining power plant cards for the auction phase (1 of 5) for each round.  No decision is without consequence and no opportunity can be wasted if you want to win the game. This is what some gamers call a "BRAINBURNER."  It is a mathematical, systematic, sequential reasoning kind of game that takes 2 hours to play. Now for some legitimate cons that we see to be easily reconciled with patience.  For new players or for very analytical over-thinking folks, this game can bring on symptoms of "Analysis Paralysis" where it feels like another players turn seems to take longer than it needs to and thus, the morale of the group playing can diminish. It's not the easiest game to teach without first playing through a game to understand how it fits together and I could see how impatient players or those who avoid conflict in terms of games that have limited number of resources, might not initially enjoy this game until they become more confident with its deep strategic gameplay.  

The pros far outweigh the cons in our book.

TEACHING TAKEAWAYS: As a parent and pastor, I like how this game can teach and simulate sound economic principles and reasonable resource stewardship for intentional sequential decision-making. I appreciate how a game like this one can demonstrate how your decisions directly effect the decisions of other players and vice versa. Personally, as a lifelong learner with ADHD, games like these help me to focus and make tactical decisions wisely by following a one-step-at-a-time process while remaining aware of the long-term strategy with an end goal in perspective.  As for my wife, she really likes the mathematical/probability/statistics learning curve this game presents kids and adults who take the time to play this game.  Finally, good map-based games (i.e. "Ticket to Ride") like this can foster basic geography skills with learning city locations in various countries/continents.

The theme is a little bit uninspiring, but the gameplay is ok with some auction and blocking as well as resource management.  It's a little stale for me and there are WAY too many games ahead of this one to say that it is going to make the table with any frequency.

Great "german" playing mechanic where everybody competes until the final round, no one is left behind bevuase of a bad move. Strategy and tactics but no co-operation or negotiation between players. Great art work and realistic "market" mecanisms
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
One of my all-time favorite games!

Pros:
-Easy to learn/teach
-Strategy is easy enough that new players should have no trouble making long-term decisions relatively early on. -Very little element of luck (one deck of shuffled cards/other player choices).
-Player order mechanics ensure that players are rarely ever out of contention before end-game.
-Game scales well for multiple players but 3+ is recommended for auction mechanic.

Cons:
-Not good with 2 (Robots expansion helps)
-Round oil barrel pieces often roll away (small gripe)

I really like this game.  There is always a hard choice of what to spend you money on: should I connect to another city?  Save my money to get more resources?  Buy that new super effecient reactor that just went on sale?

Nice to have two maps to choose from. Takes about 30 minutes per player, so allow plenty of time for 6 players. Like the combination of commodities market, auctioning power plants, and network building.

It really is no surprise that I enjoy Power Grid.  At its heart, it is a connection game similar to others that I really enjoy.  (As an aside, I still regret not picking up the original "crayon-rails" edition so similar to my beloved Empire Builder.)  Unfortunately, it is a game that I still have not quite figured out.  I'm pretty sure that I have yet to win the base game (thought I have a lot of second place finishes).  My timing seems to be off by a turn whenever I play.  Perhaps when I get that figured out I will finally be able to win.  Still, an excellent game that I am happy to play.  [02/02/2008]

I like the green guy's games and this is probably his most successful as it is the most conservative in theme and design. Auction balancing makes this balanced throughout the whole game and it just works extremely well. Highly recommended.

I've upped the rating on this one as, after playing it last night, I've decided it's my favourite(and I didn't even win!). The game looks good and the mechanics are clear allowing you to concentrate on your gameplay. Last night played with the France map, which I found especially good with the overcrowded Paris region.

Bought this game a long time ago to prove to myself I was a strategic hard core board gamer, haha. I played it once with a group and liked it. Brought it home and tried a few 2 player games with my wife but the auction mechanic stunk.

This game rocks.  Maybe it's because I work for the local electrical utility, but I love this game.  The game plays smoothly from the early game right through to the end game.  Lots of fun with 3 people (as long as one person doesn't try and be king/queen maker), I keep trying to convince my wife that it'll scale well with 2 but she ain't biting.  Either way, I strongly suggest it.

Finally got to play Power Grid with 2 players.  The dynamic changes quite significantly.  Not better or worse, it just changes.  Especially in the Plant bidding phase.

Still my favourite game by far.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
What was I rambling about in my old comment?

Anyhow it's an engine building game with an auction to get engine parts and then other stuff (like resource market and building the electric grid). On board spatial part means some blocking is possible. Best thing about this game is  how intuitive the theme works - buy a plant, then a fuel for said plant, then build a network, then burn fuel in plant to supply network and get money. And dramaturgy of the game is also interesting even with it's funny catch up mechanisms (this is how we run economy in Europe).

Problems: 
- Bureaucracy. There are some fiddly rules governing the flow of the game that should be damn highlighted in the rulebook! There's a bgg file that helps with that, so print it ouot. 
- Art. I still don't get. Retro, but depressing and brown? Uhm. I love retro, but for me this would mean socialism with it's bring utopia of industrial rebuilding and dirty skies. The anniversary edition is basically what I wanted, just not sure if I love this game so much. 

Why I've traded it: I got 3 plays in 5 years. Ok I was playing other people's copies as well. This gets played so rarely which is a bit of a shame as I find it much better than most current euros (but when it will get played, somebody is bound to own a copy). It's also a bit long - I like similar style game Fleet better just because it's shorter.

RATING: 5
Totally overrated. Some elegant rules, but it's a familiy game with a way too strong catch-up mechanism for the weaker players. Games get mostly decided by the randomness of powerplant cards at the end. So I think it's still somewhat fun, but nothing really exceptional.

Good game, with lots of think about. However, the auto-balancing mechanism is a little forced.

Six players is too many, unless they are not deep calculators. Very mathematical at the end, and too many games decided on tiebreakers. The game can thus be repetitious as you calculate every turn in roughly the same way.

And one more thing: too much depends on what plants get flipped up. An excellent fix is that the next four upcoming plants are made known before they become available.

I played this for the first time this past weekend and came away very interested by what Power Grid brings to the table.  Almost the entire system of rules is designed to prevent a runaway victory by one person which really serves as a great way to keep the game interesting as it enters the late phase.  The Resource Market adds an interesting element which can force a player to adjust his current strategy because of financial concerns.  

It seems like its a better game when there are more players and when everyone enjoys the auctions.  If you're not a fan of the auction mechanic, you won't like this game.

Otherwise, pretty good fun and I look forward to playing it again.

Fantastic game. Complex, balanced, tense, interesting. The strategies are subtle and intense. 

The more I play it the more I like it. It keeps going up on my rating chart. (Ok, so it stopped at 10).

It gets better the more often I play it with others who also understand the game and strategies to approach it with. The expansion maps do add to the game--I really like them--but even after 30ish plays on the original boards I still find the game satisfying on those maps.

I love playing this game and finally owning my own copy is great.  The rules accommodate for one of my friends in particular that tries to break every game as hard as he can; this one is a nut he wasn't able to crack and yet he, and everyone, still has fun.

Efficiency is the key to this one.  Requires a fair bit of thinking and planning, but the turns still seem to flow nicely.  The random component introduced by the power plant auction is very nicely done.

[22 plays] Have really enjoyed this game very much with all numbers of players, from 2 on up to 6. Update 6/4/11: As I cross beyond 20 completed plays, I will modify to say that I don't rate the game a "10" with just 2 or with the full complement of 6 player. I do think it is simply outstanding with 3,4, or 5 players.

This game is an excellent deeper game, and I personally enjoy the mechanics of the power plant market and the resource market of which others have been critical. I don't think they're fiddly, I think they are cool and the unique mechanics make the game.

Power Grid is all about the plant auctions. What to buy and when to buy -- based on the resource market, the current and future demands on resources by the other players, and watching the number rank of the plant if turn order is still of high concern. I absolutely LOVE that mechanic. It wraps me up and makes my gray cells burn in a most delicious way.

Controlling auctions as best you can, controlling your place in the turn order to your best advantage, and calculated grid expansion decisions on the map are all critical. Minute decisions can mean the difference between win and loss when playing with sharp competitors.

Great game - I love the auction mechanic and the supply and demand system of resources. For me, the first half of this game is tons of fun and then it lasts about 30 minutes longer than it feels like it should. Also, determination of the winner always feels so anticlimactic.

I think this is excellent! The same basic idea as Ticket to Ride, but an auction mechanic reduces randomness while a maintainance mechanic introduces a greater degree of difficulty in planning.

Not a terrible game, but not a great game either. Of the few times I've played it, my feelings of Power Grid were: 

1st - Interesting game. Could be fun. A little drawn out in the middle.

2nd - Okay game. The game seems to slow down too much during play.

3rd - Good God this game takes forever. And I lost by not being able to buy ONE barrel! The first 2 players bought extra to block me and even though I had the most $$ I'm stuck. There should be a reserve rule. Seems like bad game design to have all of those unused barrels sitting in the reserve if you can't buy them. Even if you had to pay $20+ or a penalty it would make more sense. Talk about a horrible way to lose the game. KINGMAKER GAMES SUCK! Can you tell I'm bitter?

4th - How did I get talked into playing this again? I'm still bitter from the last game.

The "gateway" game that did it for me(past Settlers which doesn't really count since it didn't get me into this hobby that much but rather got me to this game). It's a very tightly crafted Euro game that has economic, area control, and auction components as well. If you like train games, then you'll like this game too. I didn't give it a 10 only because for some reason the end game for this euro game is even more abrupt than most Euro games.

This has quickly become my favorite board game with a terrific balance of game mechanics.  Easy to learn but also allows for a deep level of strategy.  It scales wonderfully for 2 - 6 players but is an absolute blast to play with more people.

This one finally made it to the table, and frankly I was not as impressed as thought I would be.  For starters, maybe it's the translation, but the terms "step", "round", and "phase" were not applied like I thought they should be.  I think a lot was determined by the random draw of power plants, such so that you wouldn't know ahead of time whether it was advantageous to go first or last.

This one also takes a bit more time than expected.  Both games I've played seemed to have the "Oh, this is going along smoothly" moment about an hour into playing, only to have another two hours before completion.

Power Grid is another one of those games that in my opinion is too simple for what it is. There is a solid game mechanic that is flavored well, but when it comes down to it all it's just math. As a guy who has a degree in math this gets boring really fast. Within two games of Power Grid I was done with it. I see why people like it, but it just does not appeal to me as much as it does them I suppose.

RATING: 5
I really like Power Grid, although the rules booklet is bloody awful - more examples required and less waffly text. 

My criticisms of it are that people sometimes can't tell WHY they won or lost - there's no specific strategy or event to pin it on... it's more the result of a string of small successes or mistakes - an electro overspent here or there. 

Also, it's quite fiddly and requires quite intense "management" of the board, cards, materials and money. Played on BSW with all the work done by the computer it flows a lot better, but then the auctioning side of it is sterile. I need to play much more to fully grasp it and will revisit my score of 8 after more plays.

EDIT:  Revised to a 7. I like it, but with my group I have to micromanage it intensely and it becomes less relaxing and fun.

EDIT AGAIN:  I don't like Power Grid.  I just don't like it, OK?  Too mathsy.

Always a fan favourite with my gaming group!  The outcome is always slightly different and because everyone has no choice but to compete for the same resources and power plants, it's chalk full of player interaction.  I like the balance of the game, and I especially like how the winner is seldom obvious until the last couple turns.

RATING: 8
I have to be in the right mood for this game, because it's a bit stressful. The auctions and buying fuels and cities and connections leaves you needing to think a couple turns ahead just to come out with even a dollar or two leftover. When I do play it, I enjoy it a lot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A neat game, with a good economic market aspect, combined with futures bidding, resource management and city connection.  However, sometimes all of the bean counting gets to be a little old.  A better "money system" would really help this game...

finally played this much-talked about game. this is the only game which my wife (who is not really a gamer) agrees with a 10 rating! a definitely must have in any decent collection.

RATING: 9
It fills a niche exceptionally well. A weekly game night can play with six players, and have a very strong Euro that completes in reasonable time. My first few plays were very exciting, subsequent plays have become fun arm wrestles. It has its flaws, like the slightly dissatisfying third phase and the luck of the draw with power plants, but I'm always up for a game, different maps are just icing on the cake.

Nekem a jól kitalált mechanizmus, ami a lemaradókat segíti, kimondottan tetszik. Igazán jó gazdasági játék, bármilyen játékosszámmal. Egyszerű szabályok, feszes, végig izgalmas játékmenet. Kimondottan előny a sok játékos lehetősége. Bár azt kell mondanom ketten is jól játszható és úgy teljesen más stratégia lehet a nyerő. Egyetértek azokkal, akik szerint a puritán kinézet illik a játékhoz és nem is néz ki rosszul.
Egyedüli negatív dolog, hogy egy kicsit száraz a játék a nem gémerek számára.

[2011-10-15]
Úgy tűnik nagyon gondolkodós is lehet egy-egy parti. Nem gondoltam volna, hogy 3 és fél órát is elhúzódhat egy négyszemélyes játék. Ennyi parti után nagyon úgy érzem az utolsó 2 kör a vége előtt jó játékosok között túl sokat számít. Az a szerencse, hogy végül milyen erőművek kerülnek ki a pakliból véletlenszerűen az elején, döntő dolog is lehet. Ettől függetlenül továbbra is zseniális játék.

RATING: 8.5
I love this game - it has some minor game play issues but on the whole, one of those classics.

CONS: the instructions are reeealy difficult to interpret so make sure you check out the simplified versions on bgg. The 2 player game was not so good in terms of how to end, but further info  suggested to only play 3 regions which simulates larger player groups so you need to fight for space.  The end in my opinion should be not only how many cities you have but you should have to power them otherwise some aspects/mechanics of the game play becomes a bit one dimensional even though the overall game is quite multidimensional.  Again, the only thing I am a bit unimpressed by is the powering of areas, it seems like it should be tied in more with winning rather than simply providing income because when you get closer to the end you aren't motivated to spend extra power up cash and this part of the game languishes. 

PROS: This is such a superb game overall, with some ironing out of the very flexible rules to your own liking, this is such a classic. Very cool industrial revolution style cards and nice over reaching dimensional game play  ,fun and certainly good for beginners if an experienced player can explain the rules or you have good "rule reading skills". Basically, Power Grid is one of my partners favorites - very nice solid economics and resource game. I LOVE the resource rarity mechanic - as resources become popular they become rarer driving up the value so you can't always count on resources being worth a particular amount.  It throws a nice element of variation into repeat games. 


It is a pretty good game and recommended plus the theme is super nice and a breath of fresh air in what my partner describes as the usual eurogame themes of stale medieval hogwash. (I beg to differ but there you go)

Only one 4-player game and it wasn't as fun as I'd hoped, maybe because we read the rules wrong and had everybody start out in different sectors of the map so one player got to expand way faster with cheaper connections, leaving the rest of us in the dust.

Will play again with proper rules and poker chips instead of those darn stuck-together paper bills for money.  I think Suburbia was inspired by many mechanics in Power Grid.

Excellently designed game with lots of important, small moves often having the greatest impact.  Player interaction is pretty strong for a euro game, and the turn order system is very clever and interesting.  Games tend to drag in the early stages, and the most exciting part (endgame) is often too quickly reached and too short, unfortunately.  Still a very solid game, but not quite up there with my favorites.

Power Grid is has become an unstoppable favorite.  Since this has come out it is one of the few games that never fails to hit the table with frequency, never fails to excite me, and consistently challenges me without frustration.  This is also the only games that started as a 7 in my mind and grew to a 10.  I held out on the 10 rating for a long time as the potential irritation of the phase 2 stall was too present, but I so frequently want to play this and intensely enjoy the design that I've stopped caring about brinkmanship.

The market, the value rotation of the plants and the simplification of the connection system from funkenschlag make this game a modern masterpiece.

It's taken me forever to get this game onto a personal table and actually figure out and compete in effectively, but I finally made it.
Liking it more and more, as I continue to learn. It's a little unforgiving in some ways. Early mistakes can be costly and on the starting end of my personal learning curve, I tend to spend a lot of time going through the motions after I've screwed up in some way; just watching as other players finish up. It's one of those games that's at its best with a table full of wily veterans. The good news is that I'm invested in getting myself into that category.

I am not sure why this game is popular...the map choices is kinda pointless, it is obvious 90% of the time where I am suppose to go.

This is a heavyweight game. I rate it below it's BGG rating since it is only interesting when every player is an expert in it already. Otherwise somebody will lag behind from round two or three if they make a mistake in the beginning like not expanding their network enough or failing to get enough fuel, and for a 1.5-2 hr game, that's not the most fun use of time.

I picked up Power Grid sight-unseen. It is definitely an excellent game. There's a small bit of similarity to Ticket to Ride with the map and the limited access to cities. I've heard that it could be very slow due to analysis paralysis, but I didn't have a problem. The choice of cities to go to was usually straightforward, and the only tough calculation was coming up with a fudge factor if you're not the first person building so that you know how much money you can't spend on a power plant and resources. The only downsides are that there are a few fiddly rules (that were still easy enough to figure out as we worked through our first game) and the rulebook isn't the most clearly written example.

There's a lot to like about Power Grid.  I enjoyed the auction stage, I really like the management of money for the three stages, and I like the graphics and presentation of the game.  This is a serious winner for me and I can't wait to play again!  With 3 I found it quite fun, with 6 it is enjoyable, but there is a lot of waiting between turns.  Certainly bad to be leader in a 6-player game!

Even those who aren't really into euro strategy type games or just not really into a lot of boardgames will love this game. My gf isn't really into playing board games a whole lot like me but this is her favorite game!

once the novelty of the auctions wore off after the second play, this one fell flat.  not enough interesting decisions to make and too harsh and impersonal an endgame.  feels like one move can win or lose you the game late on, regardless of how well you played in previous rounds. fun artwork and clever resource market mechanism. also dig the china/korea market variation.

Power Grid is in my favorite category of game: the very accessible medium weight game.   I've had no trouble teaching this to newbies, and it's gone over well with just about everyone.  
Pros and cons:
Gameplay is clunky at first, but the included player aids give a very useful Turn Summary.  Power Grid involves a lot of addition, especially in the late game, which can lead to slow turns by some players.  Money is hidden, so the lack of perfect information helps to encourage best-guessing over min-maxing.  
In my experience, PG scales well from 2-6, but 5 is the sweet spot.

Wasn't as complicated as I thought, though maybe I'm getting used to heavier games. Board is uneven (east better); a lot of math to do; possibly just one strategy and a matter of who does it best. I'm not sure it is the 7th best game of all time.

Despite what seemed to be a very dry subject, I read the rules and found them interesting enough to purchase the game.

We played a 4-player game and liked it. (Much of the US map has expensive connections--we thought the map would be pretty homogenous but it wasn't.)

Guys and gals both appear to like it. And, at the end, many people were close to winning it. (Which could imply that strategies don't account for too much.)

Can you keep the lights on in twelve cites with just two tons of coal and a stick of uranium?  Well you could, except somebody just bought all the damn coal.  Again.  But hey, name another game where you can buy uranium.  It took me way longer than it should have to recognize the critical importance of the plant auction, and I still haven't learned enough not to get royally boned every other game.

This is a wonderfully easy game to learn and a hard game to master. Each and every mechanic is subtly tied into all other mechanics. Playing with the turn order and the many ways to stall each others plans is what makes this game stand out for me.
There is still a lot to learn with just the base game and there are already a lot of expansion maps I can't wait to play, each with their own rule twists. I'm especially interested in the Benelux map, of course because I'm Dutch but also because it's supposed to shorten the game a fair bit, which would make it get to the table more often!
Brilliant game. Each and every session has been very exciting, so far. Twice it came down on the tie breaker of having the most money.

I don't get the appeal of this one.  Sure, the first thirty minutes or so are fun as you get your power plants and make your first couple of connections, but from that point forward, it seems that you're just going through the motions, as it's impossible to catch up (or fall behind, for that matter).  I'll need to have another play to finalize my thoughts on this one.

UPDATE: I think that three (or at most four) players is what's needed for this one.  Finally played it again and got in a tense and fun three-player game that was actually fun.

UPDATE #2: Played a dynamic six-player game and actually liked how it seemed that the game situation was pretty fluid, elevating my rating just a bit more. Still remain unconvinced that it's amazing, but it's growing some on me.

UPDATE #3: In thinking about this, I think much of the game is encompassed in the auction, and there are better auction titles out there.

RATING: 6
This is a train game in disguise, but there are enough train games already, and the theme works. It may be a bit more luck-driven than Wallace's Steam, and it's a bit fiddlier, but not intolerably so. For an accessible introduction to economic games, this one is hard to beat. The dedicated fanbase is a testament to its longevity. It's a good game.

For me, Power Grid's major detraction is the turn order manipulation, which is both "gamey" and too forgiving. I often feel as if I'm playing against the system more than the other players, and the system protects any one player from getting beaten too badly. Especially in longer economic games like Power Grid, I've come to value swingier economies with fewer safety nets. Against experienced players I win most games I play or I come very close. That's a symptom of the larger problem, which is that Power Grid has become routine. I don't find myself discovering anything new about the other players or the game. Instead I do the same kind of calculations and execute a variation of the same plan game after game. If I didn't do well, it would be because I got lazy, not because I was outwitted. It's all a bit rote.

Enjoyable game, rules are easy enough.  Big drawback for me is how much you can fine-tune it until you become a Powergrid-machine + you would count number of points per move, especially in the last rounds (you don't have to play them, you can just count the number of points you are going to make and that's it).  So the beginning of the game is very enjoyable, and then somehow near the end I would think "Oh well, whatever, yes I could score two more point if I did this or that, maybe I will think over each move for ten minutes...".

RATING: 8.8
Components - .9/1 Box is nice. Board is solid. Resources are pieces instead of tokens. The cards all seem very reasonable. The rulebook is generally laid out well, though unless playing with 4 when reading through the rules, it wasn't the best at calling out the differences for more/less players. Artwork although isn't amazing fits the theme fine.

Fun - .9/1 This is a very enjoyable game. There's a fair amount to plan out and think about when it isn't your turn, so you're always involved. As common in euros, the decision optimization syndrome can overwhelm almost anyone towards the late game, so there are times where turns need to be sped along to keep the game moving. This is mostly dependent on the people playing, but does take away a little.

Replayability - .7/1 The different power plants (after the initial setup) are random enough that people are generally forced to change their strategy, which in turns changes how the game plays out. The maps can get a little samey after many plays, but they are still enjoyable.

Strategic - .9/1 Only random element is the available/futures market for power plants. These can greatly influence what people are playing. You need to keep track of what resource everyone needs, as well as the number of cities they can power. Lastly the auction phase allows for a whole different element in the game. The only knock is that the city purchasing phase (after the initial placement) almost always has a single option to go, and the strategy is almost always whether to buy or not, rather than which to buy. This is only one phase, and isn't an always the case.

Theme - .9/1 Definitely feels like you're handling (a very simplified) market for power/materials. The concept is nicely executed. The game element that draws me out of the theme is probably the actual current/futures market on power plants. From a game perspective it greatly enhances the game experience, it combined with some smaller minor stuff just draws me out of the theme enough to warrant a small deduction.


Personal Rating - 4.5/5 I really enjoy this game. The euro balance is well done and many times people who we thought were done halfway through came back and won the game. It's obvious weakness is that the group has to be willing to not spend forever analyzing every move they're going to take to keep the game moving, which really is the games glaring weakness. Obviously this hasn't swayed my opinion of the game much, because I still rate it very highly.

Good economic game that requires a lot of mental calculations and long-term planning. Implements a "bash-the-leader" mechanic that prevents anyone from running away with the lead. End-game tends to be one giant "rush" so it can be a bit anti-climatic.

I was very pleasantly surprised by this game.  I usually avoid games like Brass and Steam because the whole economic engine component of them don't really seem like my thing.  I've never been that adept or interested in math or economics so I wouldn't think I would enjoy it in a game.  I did want a game with a better auction component than something like Medici or Ra though so I picked up Power Grid.

The game is incredibly well designed.  The supply and demand engine of the resource market, the nuanced auction market, diminishing returns in the power network, everything blends together smoothly and works well without too much flipping back through the rulebook (which is short, concise, and well-written by the way).  I will say that playing with a casual group, like I did, is probably better than playing with more hardcore gamers though.  We played with hidden money and while everybody balanced their money to adhere to their plan of buying plants, resources, and networking cities nobody held the game up with AP trying to build the most efficient economic engine every turn.  That method would probably win you more games at the cost of fun, especially for everyone else at the table.

All in all, amazingly well-designed game that I quite enjoyed despite my predilections for non-economic board games.  I may look into playing others now, as long as it is with the right (read: more casual) group.

This game is a little long, but other than that, wow is it fun. I love seeing what power plants will come up and the bidding adds a lot of tension to the game.

1st game 2 player with wife to get a feel for the rules. She went from sceptic to complete fan girl in about 10 minutes. Enjoyed it so much that we skipped the Rules advice to just play the first step and went all the way through. 

Why do i like this game so much? It has the rhythem of a middle distance race where its in your interest to be conserving energy, slotted just behind the leaders. The key to the game is 1) Manipulating your position 2) Efficiency - and 3) knowing your relative financial position vis i vis opponents.

The raw materials market is genius, and i can't think of a better, or simpler way, of gaming supply and demand.

The auction is superb as well, with just enough randomness to mean you need to play the odds a little as what Power plant will fall out is not known (apart from the China map)

I very much doubt i will ever tire of this game. 

February 2013

I am in a minority of one who plays the game by instinct rather than calculation. The end game math is almost eliminated (other than how do i get to 17?) if you concentrate on the simple building blocks of efficient power plants that, cheap power stockpiled, keeping out of energy sectors others are in and cheap and roomy early connections - the game then does the work for you

Reading 'Characteristics of Games' has made me wonder if the catch up mechanism (i.e turn order) is actually what makes this game great. As if the part of the game that is inserted to balance it is actually the fulcrum of decision making. If it were a design intention it's a stroke of genius

I stayed away from this for a long time.  I mean, who thought buying power plants and lighting cities could be anything but some dry spreadsheet of a game?  I was so wrong.

An excellent economic game.  Everything seems to work well even if it is stitched together by rules exceptions which are thrown in to maintain game balance.  The end result is extremely rewarding.

The only knock I can think of is that you might as well call it "Profit/Loss Statement: The Game."  The game is very heavy on crunching numbers every turn in order to try and achieve the best build possible to end up with the most money by the end.  Some people just hate this.  Being an economics major with an accounting background, I find it quite fun, but it can burn you out after a few sessions.  That's the sole thing keeping it from being a 10.  It's a good burnout, though.

I very much enjoy it.  I'm not fantastic at it, either, which is refreshing, since I'm often the winner in heavy games.  I wish the play on the actual map was a little more significant or interesting, but that's a minor point.

The interesting parts are the power plants and associated resources.  I enjoy the tension between efficiency of plants and their capacity.  If, for example, you can grab a good wind plant (capacity 3 or 4) on the second round for not too much, it will give you a substantial edge because you're spending less for resources than the other players.  However, investing in that same plant on turn seven is totally counterproductive.

Me enganchó, y es bastante simple. En mi primera partida salí segundo, por haber cometido un error en mi primer turno (cuando aún no entendía la importancia de la subasta), y porque otro jugador gatilló el final anticipadamente. Menos denso de lo que esperaba, y mucho mas divertido.

First two plays in the same night, really nice game. But I can see that it will not be one of my favourites, the theme isn't strong enough for me. Rated 6.5 and I would like to keep playing this once or twice a year, but that should be enough.

Had a feeling that bigger plants should need more fuel for a more interesting (and perhaps accurate) game, but I'm sure the balance is great as it is.

Update: played some more, and I must say this game does have appeal. It's still fiddly and and overtly mathy, but is some fun kind of way. Would like to play again, I guess.
****
This must be one of the most overrated games in the history of BGG. Power Grid is a typical 'calculation game', in the vein of games like Caylus and Java, that most eurogamers seem to prefer. Not me, although I'm a real eurogamer. Power Grid is already pretty long by itself, but it has all kinds of rules to further slow it down. 
First, there's the constant arithmetic of calculating how much you need to pay for your resources, how many houses you can afford and what you want to save for the next auction. 
But more important, the game rewards inaction: to get the game moving along, you have to build houses. But build the most, and you're suddenly shut out of buying resources, or only at insane prices if you're lucky. So nobody is inclined to build houses, unless they're sure they'll end the game with it, winning in the process.
I don't really mind playing Power Grid, but it's several leagues away from being a great game for me.

Quintessential Euro game.  Highly replayable.  This game can be a little slow at times, and there's lots of maintenance which is a little annoying.  Setting up the power plant deck with the expansion is a little annoying.  This would be a good candidate to play on the iPad if it's ever offered for iPad.  I like when a computer takes care of annoying maintenance.  The pipe costs seem to add a little randomness to the game that annoys me.

Has a wonderful market "system" but the game has definite lulls in actions which are low-points.  We've played this a lot over the last 2 years and it's a great bridge game into more in-depth eurogames, but it is decidely lackluster the more we've played.  Rather than building in excitement to the very end, it typically is decided before the final move except in the rarer money-tie-breaker.  Over all there are many games which are a much better excitement to time-spent value.  Tyros, of course, comes to mind but also Tower of Babel, Samurai, Arkadia, Santa Fe Rails.  If you've got 5 players, Oasis and Santiago are hard to beat.

Horrible punish the leader by as obvious a method as possible--literally, it's as bad as "if you lose your queen in chess, remove random 3 pieces from opponents side as well"

So I finally got a chance to play the venerable Power Grid for the first time, and I was surprised by how rules-light it was given its long-time high ranking on BGG (rightly or wrongly or somewhere in betweenly, I tend to associate high BGG ratings with extremely dense, long-lasting, Euro-style brain exercises).  But despite the beginner-friendliness of the game, as with many of BGG's highest ranked game, I thought it was okay but will not go out of my way to play it again.  As a whole, it's quite a clever game, but I personally don't tend to enjoy auction-oriented games all that much.  And outside of the auctions for power plants, I didn't think that there was much in the way of meaningful decisions to be made, since the route-building was usually pretty obvious (take the cheapest routes that allowed you to get in the way of the other players the most), and the purchasing of resources generally involved buying all the resources required to power your plants for that turn, but not much more (unless the price was particularly good).  The physical components are okay, with the illustrations giving the game a fun, stylized look.  So overall, I admire the design without being personally thrilled by the game.  (Still, I'd be interested in trying out "The First Sparks" if given the opportunity.)  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 2/5  Total: 5.5/10

High degree of strategy, luck really only plays a part in the power plants up for auction, and that pretty minimally effects one player's advantage over another because the turn order keeps shifting based on who's in the lead.  Much fun.  I was very engaged.

As it stands, I'm having fun, and I can't wait to play it some more.

[Several plays]  A solid game.  It has player interaction as people get in each other's way on the map and bid against each other in auctions.  It has built in ways of throttling the leaders with resource cost and building order.  It has a theme the makes sense for the game.  It is not super long to play.  I just have enjoyed this game each time I have had the chance to play it.  Definately a top calibar design.  The really kicker that pushes it up to the 9 rating is the supply and demand mechanic with the resources. The more I have played this game the more I like it.  The expansion maps and cards add variety as well.

RATING: 7
[RGG 2004 Edition] {Economic; auction, connection, variable-player-order, resource management; optimal 4-5p} Power Grid is a decent strategy game. It is unforgiving and brain-teasing due to the multifaceted development system. Because of its complexity, PG needs a long learning time. PG is not very confrontational for 3-4 players but is highly confrontational in 5-6p! 

PG is a rich game. It provides players many tactical options and rooms of strategic planning. It has good player interaction as well. It's quite engaging because of the strong competition of cities, resources and power plants. The system PG is well-balanced - no run-away leaders, no leader bashing and no king-making; it's very good.  There is a learning curve in PG.  Players need a few games to understand the game well.

PG is a rich game but not an elegant game.  The theme is not convincing, though existent. It is not intuitive because of the exceptions and the artificial rules; therefore, it's easy to get confused when it is firstly played and player aids are necessary to avoid errors. PG is a little bit fiddly - power plant markets, resources, different phases and stages, etc. 

PG is not very suitable for newbie because players have to consider many things in the game such as the price of resources, the distribution of the network, the power plant, etc.

Very maths heavy.  At its heart it's an auction game about buying power plants.  It's also a network building game.  The auction and market mechanics are fun but the "punish the leader" mechanic is awful.  As is the network mechanic, which requires a lot of maths to find the optimal solution (and there is an optimal solution).

I don't really like this much but I can generally be coerced into playing it.

There is so much variation in such a simple package.

The endings are usually tense though, although not everyone is in it by the end.

This game is almost always challenging and intriguing to play. I love trying to out-maneuver the other players in order to reap the benefits of cheap, efficient fuel. Of course, in order to do this you have to not only pay attention to the raw materials market and your set of power plants, but also player order (dictated by cities you have built in), the power plants currently owned, and the future power plant market. Everything just seems to hang together so nicely and the game has a wonderful rhythm to it, and trying to read that rhythm to predict the ebb and flow of the various commodities is great fun. Also the auction mechanic provides a welcome, more confrontational aspect than other popular euros such as Puerto Rico and Agricola. This game falls in to a similar bracket for me as Settlers of Catan, in that despite lots of play time I have yet to hit on a sure fire strategy, which is great as it stops the game from becoming an algorithmic exercise and promotes meaningful play.

Dropped rating slightly as it's a bit too heavy and math-sy for repeated plays now.

The two player game is surprisingly good considering that auction mechanics normally don't work very well with only two players.

RATING: 6.75
Fun game, but it punishes the leader too much. You really have to just edge behind everyone and jump ahead at the last second.

Besides its flaws it is still a very fun game.

Update: Still a good game, although a little mathy at times (especially on the last 2 turns). The main reason I've dropped my rating from 7.5 to 7 is because of the duration of the game for new players. Plus, you're always doing the same basic thing every turn. No real thought process in my opinion. I really wish there was some hidden information element, like secret cards that people could play to cause special events. As is, the game is getting too bland to be a top tier game in my eyes.

Update 2: Just way too mathy and AP prone for my tastes now. Still a classic that I'll play from time to time, but not a game I'll ever seek out. Wish there was more hidden and random information than simply math calculations going on.

Very very good - has it all - great for any number up to 6, tight play without feeling like its forcing a close outcome.  Relatively easy to teach.  Only possible black mark is that there are some rules that are tough to nail down.  Plays in 2 hours even with 6.  Great game.

One of the best features of this game is how the mechanics are set up to provide small advantages to those in 'last' place and small disadvantages to those in 'first' place, resulting in tight games that reward those who can best maneuver relative to their opponents.

This is a fabulous game.  Poker chips are a must (in lieu of the paper money), though it does have the interesting effect of being able to count everyone's money which is supposedly hidden.

Now that I realize my attraction to train games, and that this is in fact a train-less train game, it makes a lot of sense.

Probably the best game I own.  (Ed: no, it's either TTA or Chicago Express)

One of the best economic games out there.  It teaches the value of expansion and conservation.  There are a lot of small startegy tips player will find as they play this game more and more.  As a game, it's great.  The money's tight and the decision, meaningful.

I own the Benelux/Central Europe board, Brazil/Spain & Portugal board, China/Korea board, France/Italy board, Northern Europe/United Kingdom & Ireland board, Quebec/Baden-Wurttemberg board, Russia/Japan board, Australia/Indian Subcontinent board, the Stock Companies, and the New Power Plant Cards Deck.

RATING: 3.5
Really only 2 decisions in this game; which power station to buy and where to lay your track. The problem is where you lay your track is pretty obvious and mostly governed by every other players previous lay. As for power station, you don't know if you bought the right one until after the buying round is complete, the new ones can really screw or help. 

Actually I'm prepared to concede that the initial placement is also critical and and make or break your game.

Power Grid is exactly what a long Eurogame should be.  The turns go relatively quickly yet there is a ton to think about.  It's mostly about maximizing your money and most games are close.  It's not to hard to teach or play so it makes a good introduction to heavy Euros.

RATING: 7
This is very close to being an excellent game but a few infuriating flaws prevent it from being quite as good as its overall rating on BGG suggests. The main problem I have with the game is that it tends to end anti-climatically, where it is apparent who the winner is going to be for quite some time. Once a player takes the lead there's very little the other players can do to haul them back in. This makes playing the remainder of the game rather tedious as it often lacks any real form of tension. It's also a game that's pretty unforgiving on errors. Therefore, you can make a mistake on your first turn and spend the remainder of the game waiting for it to end because you don't really have an opportunity to rectify your error. Basically, it feels as though the gameplay was worked out perfectly by the designer only for him to run out of ideas when it came to how the game should be won, which is a shame. I also find the theme of running a network of power plants a bit dry for my taste.

Played 10+ times. Got this for my brother then for me too (girl friend approved to boot).  I really like it.  Rating is going up. UPDATE: This game is fantastic.  I really like how everyone jockeys for position on the board and with the power plants.  When everyone figures out that the 3 & 4 power plants are not that great the game can bog down a little in the middle.  Perhaps someone should just make a variant where some of them are removed. 2006/01/28

Tried a few two-player games and it's worthless. You must be at least three, and with four it becomes much better. The idea is to expand as much as possible but stay smaller than the others (since beeing smaller gives you the best power plants, cheapest resources and easiest expansion). In one round you go "all in" and expand past everyone else, ending the game. Timing this means to calculate the cost to succeed without anyone beeing able to respond. These "calculate the last round"-games are not that fun though.

Almost perfect! The only two disadvantages of Power Grid are:

The economist in me should LOVE this, but I just can't seem to find the spark. I think it's less exciting than my preferred economic games (Modern Art, Chicago Express) because because the game is more about valuation than letting players tweak incentives. Sure, my decision to expand here impacts the choices about how you are going to expand, but that impact is too obvious and calculable to be really interesting.

I have only played this game with 5 once.  Multiple times with 2 players (which it does not shine well).  And once with 3 players.  I do enjoy the game but I need to play some larger, longer games.  I think the system is great and very easy to understand. The game is with the players. A hallmark of a classic.

Expansions: The Robots, Benelux & Central Europe

Update: Played the new "The Trust" 2 player variant.  It actually makes the game playable with 2.  Highly recommended.  Tense and much more market worry.

Very clever in parts, and the fuel pricing mechanism works well. Also well themed, even if it does feel railway like rather than power nets. 
It has that irritating problem of having to calculate how much money you need for the following phase, and reserve it, but some actually enjoy this. It is also cutthroat when the nets get close to each other. This can screw your plans in what is always a longish game. My main complaint is that it is dry and appeals to the, umm, studious player.  Or ordered gamers, as we used to say.

Two maps on one board, I like it! The resource market fluctuates with demand in a brilliantly simple way. --- Reduced my rating. The playtime is a bit long for what it is, and therefore the game doesn't see much play. Maybe my group is playing it like a filler when it should be played with the grave seriousness of Age of Steam. I'm gonna try the Funkenschlag payout scheme next time - probably adds to the time, but hopefully also some economic tightrope fun!

This game sometimes "seems" a bit dry, sometimes take you over the board without pause. I don't know why, anyway it's really good. It's difficult for me to see a winning strategy cause every game grown in a different way (differents region, random factories, players number). I found only one little difect: the board is too colorfull, but when you play this game usually try to focus on costs numbers beetween cities. Deeper interaction beetween players, final always with high tension.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Efficiency is the name of the game! A mathy game of auctioning for and building power plants. Players need to balance their cash between the auctioning of power plants and the subsequent rounds of buying resources for said plants, and building a network of buildings to be powered by the plants. Quite prone to AP, especially towards the end. Income has diminishing rates of returns and those behind in points have an advantage in the markets, thus managing turn order is important in this game.

This is a very good, well thought out game. That being said, it's not quite my style.  It's more than I'd like to have to keep track of during a game (variable turn order based on money and auctions and resource management). I will admit that it would get a higher rating if I wasn't terrible at it.

I wanted to love this game, and at first I was convinced that I did... but now I'm not so sure.  I like the thought that's necessary for placement on the map and the whole blocking thing.  I like the resource management challenges, too.  I think the mechanics try too hard to achieve balance.  I don't like how if you get out in front early, you're penalized the next time you buy resources and build.  I dislike that plant draw can theoretically determine the winner.  It's gotten too formulaic for me... I'm not saying that any one combo will win the game for you; it's just that I've managed to figure out a very simple way to always end up in a decent position at the end, and that's as good as I ever care to get at Power Grid.  Bonus points, though... the game lets you burn garbage!

Great strategy game.  I am afraid to play anymore because I've played 15-20 times and never lost, not even once.  Key is to buy the good power plants at the right time.  I like to stay in last place until I feel fairly confident that I can surge to the lead and keep it until the end on the American map.  The German map Issa little better balanced.  Haven't played any other maps yet.

Amazing game! The decisions you have to make each turn are always meaningfull and the different aspects (resource market, map, power plants...) are beautifully tied together. This makes for very intense interaction between players, which is not only limited to the obvious area control aspects and the auctioning, but can be through the resource market and the brilliant player position meta game just alike.
I agree that it can be a bit mathy towards the end, but its not that bad. In fact we find it tons of fun to watch people getting so involved, that they start pulling their smartphones to use as calculators.

Interesting, but not that much fun...

Update: Having played it again after a long pause (and a whole bunch of more games), I still think it's an interesting design. It's not perfect and the catch-up mechanism feels a little forced, but played in the right spirit (quickly and without too much analysis) it's actually decent fun. I'd play it under these conditions, but not with people who take it seriously...

Further update: I'd forgotten to mention how much the final draw of power plants seems to determine the game. With a group of competent players, this seems to be the main deciding factor.

Ugyanis megvan a pénzed, a játék elején egy, majd késôbb két-három várost szeretnél egy lépés alatt bekötni, ehhez megnézed kell-e erômûvet venned, megnézed mennyi nyersanyag kell, kiszámolod a lóvét (nyersanyag ára, bekötés ára), ebbôl már tudod mi az az összeg amit maximum erômûre költhetsz a licitálás során, azt kész, ennyi, leléped. Hármas partiban ez mindannyiunknak sikerült, nemigen kellett taktikázni, csak pénzt számolni, ami mindig elég volt.

Az még fontos lehet, hogy a térképen honnan indul az ember.

Második parti után (4 szem.) Most nem volt annyira triviális a dolog mint az első játékban...Nem tudom, még mindig azt állítom, hogy taktika nemigen kell hozzá

Három+ játék után. Nos eddig azt hittem az a jó, ha a ze ember mindig elkölti azt a pénzt ami a rendelkezésére áll, pontosan kiszámítva, hogy mi mennyibe kerül. De rá kellett jönnöm , hogy ennél ez sokkal összetettebb. Nagyon figyelni kell a többiekre!

Szerintem a PG nagyszerûsége abban is rejlik, hogy komoly a játék a szabályai viszont aránylag egyszerûek és így könnyen elsajátíthatóak bárki számára, nem kell sok apró szabályrészlettel bajlódni és megjegyezni.

10->9

One of my favorite games. It`s dry, but very emotional (usually i stand at the end of the game).

I love the mechanic. You want to be the last, than uou choose last a plant for bidding, buy first resources and build first houses. But you don`t earn so much money, so be last for the hole game is not good. You should have the same houses, like your capaticity of your plants. But you must by better plants. The question is when. Sometimes there is a problem. You don`t bid for a plant, and hope, the next plant will be interesting, but than the next plants can be very bad. But i think thats not bad. The luck factor with the plants is ok. Without that the game would be too shematic, and with less emotions.For some players the game is too mathematical (the whole game you count how many money you have) . The markt mechanism is interesting. You must choose how many resources you want buy. Great economic game for at least 4 players. 

Edit 2014: Still a great game, but the rating drops to 9. The game could block - if you realy need a new plant and the`re no good out there. And during the finish is a risk of kingmaking.

We played with 3, so I'm itching to play with 4-5.

RATING: 6.5
02-Mar-08: There's a reason why this game is in the Top 10. Tense turns, agonising auctions, screwage in resource buying. There's so much happening in this game and so many ways for things to go pear-shaped for the leader. The only thing that bogs this down is the calculations; after a heavy game like this, you feel like you've just sat through a maths exam!

25-Aug-08: Had a games night on Sat night. Played one long game of Power Grid. Man, we were stressed out by the 2nd hour :-p We've all played before, so i think that was the problem - we were all trying different strategies and not concentrating on building new cities which prolongs the game.

24-Feb-11: Played Power Grid a couple of weeks back at work during lunch. By the end of it, my collegues were so brain-busted that they wanted to go home! Very mathy game this.

8.0 -> 6.5 (I think there're better games now)

Power Grid is a masterpiece. The auction phase is a blast, buying cities is very satisfying, powering your cities and making money is even more satisfying, and competing for resources is cutthroat. Excellent game, my only criticism is that pretty often it can feel like the outcome is known about 20 or 30 minutes before the game ends.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
Fiddly. The last turn overwhelms the rest of the game once you get the timing down, so zero staying power as a game. You may as well just deal some random power plants, give people a lot of money, and skip right to the pain of the last turn. Then endure the last turn.

Additionally, the game fails as a realistic simulation [b]or[/b] an interesting playing experience for so many reasons. The fuel market has an unreasonable limit which can allow a player to king-make (or king-veto) when it is "better" to play towards his own interest. A poor player has too many opportunities to destroy other players' games. Far too many, "Acceptable compromises for playability," lead to complete idiocy. Auctions are far too long a period of "team counting"--insipidness does not begin to insult this game as much as it should be insulted.

I feel no success at winning; I feel no failure at losing. I feel a total waste of time. Worse: playing two-piece jigsaw puzzles for the same period would be a better use of time. Contemplating the lint in my navel would be a better use of time.

I may actually loathe this game more than blah-blah-blah-magic-carrot, as difficult as this may be to believe: I'm having difficulty devising an adequate way of gaining pleasure from burning PG.

RATING: 7.5
I played a 4 player of this game last night.  If it wasn't for all the hype about it I wouldn't have investigated the title.  I found the general theme looked boring (and it is for the most part).  While the retro style box art and colour choices make the game look a little uninteresting and overtly complex (in the board design).  The game really is better then its first impressions give.  It's a cleaver little game of decisions, with a healthy dosage of tension.  

Gameplay general revolves around resources management and expansion but the over all scoring is based on the economy and money. The game has a relatively low learning curve but seems daunting the first round. I did notice there was little interaction and high down-time causing the game to drag out longer then I felt it should have been.  The playtime started off slow, got more interesting toward the end but ended up feeling drawn out.  The final few rounds are what make the game interesting (if the over all play is sort of boring).  The ending comes as a bit of a surprise, in some ways anticlimactic but the fun in the last few rounds is what makes it entertaining.  The choices you make through the game jockey yourself into your spots in turn order and there in lies the over all strategy.  The rules themselves seemed to be rather poorly translated and generally unclear, I would have hated to play this without an experienced player present. 

The mechanic I liked the most was the fuel market system.  The over all supply and demand of the market makes for interesting choices when it comes to plants and financial quandaries when it comes to market costs.  Generally when taught by someone who has played it before the mechanics are generally clear and simple, often seeming like they rely on you having to think a round ahead.  Generally I liked this game but I think it could get tiresome after awhile.  Not a game I would play often but would be nice on rare occasions.

I appreciate Power Grid as a resource management game, but often it feels like it's a graph optimization problem (and people who haven't been prepping for software engineering interviews will tend to attempt the same style of analysis, except more inefficiently). So it really comes down to how much you think others are willing to spend. I'm sure there's also some heuristic pricing of the value of a power plant or whatnot. It's a challenge, and I don't dislike it, but I feel like there are less arithmetic-heavy games I'd rather play.

I was really surprised by how much fun I had playing this. It's got some truly brilliant mechanics. Unfortunately, it's just too long for a game that only has good mechanics going for it. If it was shorter and had an interesting theme this game would be great. As it is, it's just good.

RATING: 8
Seems to take too long for what it is. A two hour game for three players is quicker than the first version?

So far I haven't liked the endgame in every game of this I've played.

Maybe it's just that we're new to this game and aren't playing it the best. The resources start to run low and the lights start to flicker at some of the cities. One type is eaten up as another might start to replenish. Then after one type is completely gone players switch to a different type and do the same thing. It's interesting to see it happen, but sucks when you're on the receiving end of it. 

In the last game one player did a final push for 17 cities and ended the game not far in to phase 3. No one was close to competing at that point. It was a disappointing ending to a long game.

Happy bits, weird auctions, and a situation where you almost always want to be in last place, until the point where you don't.  Sometimes a bit too mathematical - everyone needs to decide ahead of time whether you want to play this as a lighthearted thing or if you want to pass out calculators.  And that's Power Grid.  Electros away!

Revised in 2007 - after introducing Power Grid to the new game group I rounded together, consisting of a 'true gamer' and a collection of 'non-gamers', it has become one of the most requested games.  It is tense, fun, lots of talking and laughing.  For a game heavy on theme, that is also very strategic, and filled with agonizing decisions, it is remarkably accessible.  Upgraded from 7.5 to 8.5.

RATING: 8
Loved everything about this game but the ending. It just seems a bit..... random/sudden I guess. This is still a fun game with many decisions to be made. Money management is a major part of playing from my point of view. It has a supply and demand factor concerning the resources and that makes this game somewhat more interesting for those looking for an economics type game. A very worthy addition to anyone's collection.

I love the presentation and visual design of the game.  However, I don't like that the only real decisions to be made in the game are in the auctions.

The designer's ability to interweave all of the different mechanics in the game is stunning. By the end of most games, I'm on the edge of my seat, and yet Power Grid still remains approachable to new players. Some complain about the turn order mechanic, but I find the decision point about when to hold back and when to surge ahead fascinating and exciting. Power Grid is about balance. Like a long distance foot race, the game forces you to keep up with the pack while maintaining enough resources in reserve to strike when it will hurt your opponents the most. The one blemish on the game is the auction mechanic for power plants. The random card flip can often give an unpredictable and therefore unfair advantage to one player.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
There are things I like about Power Grid, such as the supply and demand nature of the pricing of the raw materials.  That is brilliant.  But, it really seems like it takes too long to play to me.  And, there are some moments where a lucky flip of a power plant can really make a huge difference, particularly to the player who meticulously worked his way into last in the turn order.  So, I'm torn on how to rate it.  It doesn't make my top tier (8, 9, or 10), but it's a solid 7.

Highly overrated. I have played this game many, many times and while not a bad game and initially very fun, I don't think there is as much here as people give it credit for. There are no hair raising choices, and it's often obvious what to do. I don't find the bidding terribly fun, it's a very standard mechanic and as loose as say, making deals in Monopoly. There is some strategy in the bidding but more about maths than anything else. The final turn is the only real tense part of the game, other than early blocking which is kind of like a bad Take That game really (sometimes it's unavoidable after set up). But the final turn is super mathy. I don't hate it, but I would be ok with never playing it again.

I absolutely love the "weighted undirected graph" mechanic, though the auction-based gameplay means this is only good for larger crowds willing to sit still for 2.5+ hours. Incredibly fun, essentially a "fix'd Monopoly", just a little long in the tooth by game's end.

RATING: 7.8
A fantastic game, with just the right level of complexity. There's a satisfying level of interaction between the players, from grabbing cities that your rivals obviously want, to the power plant auctions, and even screwing opponents over by cornering the market in a particular type of fuel. The game is full of nice touches, like the mechanic for who ends the game (connected cities) versus who wins the game (powered cities). The turn order mechanic is one of the cleverest I've seen in a game, and can really reward a player deliberately hanging behind till he's ready to make his big move. To top it all off, the retro design aesthetic of the game's artwork is very satisfying.

I've frequently heard this game described as "a better version of Monopoly" and for good reason. The game mechanics reward those who bid well and are good planners. This game is relatively easy to pick up and the replay value is really high. It's complicated enough to keep more advanced players on their toes but not so much that novice gamers won't want to play. This is a great strategy game to start your collection off!

A good game, but the potential winner(s) are just a bit too apparent too early on, and it's a bit too long for this too. For this reason, almost an 8, but not quite, and I also won't get this game for myself.
The game dynamics change quite a lot depending on the number of players.

First I have to commit: I am an electrical power engineer... I work in a coal power plant :)

Everything fits in this beauty. Mechanisms, luck, strategy, tactics and it even scales wonderfully. Although I might have played a few to many 2playergames. Here the game lacks that its not important in a 2-playergame WHERE to place your cities, only WHEN because you'll have to connect all of them anyway.
The only week point might be the fixed map, but come on - there are 6 of them by now (officials only). Really looking foreward to the new powerplants to be released at Essen 07.

Played 50plus

I should give this another shot sometime, but it seemed far too simplistic to be considered an "economic" euro, rather an "economic-themed" euro. The player interaction was alright though. Maybe a 6 is a more accurate score, but I don't remember much and not looking particularly for the next play.

One of my favorites. Power plant stagnation *does* happen, but I look at it as a factor of the game to take into account when playing. Sometimes it's worth overpaying on a plant when your gut tells you the subsequent offerings won't be so hot for a while. Sees lots of play in our group.

Fabulous game - played about 5 times now and still want to play more. I can see an end in sight though so I won't give it a 10. Updated to a 10 it really is that good.

RATING: 5
Hmmmm! I just don't get the hype. This game seems like a lot of pointless, meaningless maneuverings and holding back until the right end-game power plant falls into someone's lap, they make their surge and run away with the win. The game very often seems to come down to a lucky turn of the power plant deck. Maybe playing for that one critical moment gives everyone a thrill, but for me it doesn't and the rest of this very long game is fairly pedestrian. I'll play this once or twice a year, but it doesn't hold my attention well enough to merit more plays.

Very well balanced game. The resolution of the game feels a bit random at times, almost as if only the last turn really matters. The strategy here is a bit more subtle that other games because it really is all about setting yourself up to either end the game a turn earlier than everyone expects, or to be in the best position on the last turn. 

I almost wish there were more than one way to win the game in the end, but it's tough to complain when the game is pretty nice.

I would like more maps.

Playing this with 5 or 6 is best, even though it works with fewer. With the right people this is tense.

Edit, a few years later: This game keeps growing and growing. Playing with the different expansion maps keeps it the same game, but different. Playing with the small promos is great, even though they themselves are not that good. People are greedy and they will bid on them!

Playing with The Robots makes this game very fun and good even with just two players.

This is a 10. I very rarely give a game a 10.

I've wanted to like this more, but it just hasn't played that well with the groups that I've played it with.  The "auctions" end up being one person choosing which plant, and everyone else passing.  I don't know if this is normal for the game or not...

Great game with 4 or 5 players.  I wouldn't recommend with 2 or 3 players.  I haven't tried it with 6.

It's a cool game and usually very close because of the disadvantages the leaders always face.

This is one of those rare games whose tense, tight mechanics makes up for an almost laughably boring theme (seemingly outdone only by its own sequel!). A great rulebook, quality components, and clever resource-gathering / market system make it one of the best games of the last few years. While Power Grid will reward smart, experienced players who like to think, a good teacher will make this game enjoyable even by newer gamers.

Enjoyed the game. Although it is a tough economic game, you can "play by guts". I guess that games will be more or less similar, even if you use different maps. Fun and less fiddly than I thought. 
Edit to add: The last turn of the game is a brain burning hell of calculation. If you really, really want to win, you have to calculate this very turn from beginning to end before you perform your first action, including the possibilities of the other players and resulting variants. Of course, if winning is not that important, you can just push your luck and make some guesses.

This game has some nice mechanics to keep the game close. It plays in about 2 hours as long as no one suffers from AP.

This game gets a lot of play, and few have disliked the game.

Great game.  The phases cohere together very nicely.    Surprisingly fun for such a methodical system and dry theme.  For me, it scratches the same itch as Acquire but I prefer the implementation of economic processes in this one (out-of-control bidding wars; supply-and-demand based resource market).  I'd like to try the expansion that adds more power plants to give the game a little more unpredictability.

And the box cover kicks ass.  Haters be damned.

I know the mathy-ness of this is not to everyone's taste, but it appeals to me.  The catch-up mechanism keeps the game tight, and becomes another factor to try to manipulate.  The variety of maps (and areas within the maps) keep the game fresh, and I expect to keep playing this for a long time.

This game has a great bidding system.  Unlike Goa, say, you can somewhat easily look over at your opponent and get a sense for what they want.  This makes the bidding similar in feel to Ra.  I also really like the way sometimes the right move is to not start a bid.  And the balance of getting more efficient powerplants but not buying too many.  I also think this is my favorite spirtual recreation of Civ (the computer game) as a boardgame.  I know, they seem nothing like each other, but a lot of the joy of Civ is trying to get in a grove where you are able to expand your empire quickly and efficiently.  Powergrid does this best of the games I've played.  Downside: being careful about your math really does play too big of a role in the game.

Not really my cup of tea.  I respect it, but of all the games in the Top 20 it's the one I'm least interested in playing.  Too dry, not enough interesting decisions or moments of high tension.  There's a sense of accomplishment when things go right, but I rarely feel like I had to work all that hard to get there, in the way that I do in, say, Agricola or Puerto Rico.

Apples and oranges, probably, but for me this is a game focused on meticulous optimization of a non-exciting theme.  Of course I'll play it again, but it's not one I'll be suggesting very often.

Fantastic game! It's a shame it sat on my games shelf for nearly a year before we started playing it. Now it's one of my favorites. Might be a litle too much math in the final turn(s) but it remains fun, even when I get my ass kicked (which is nearly all the time).

I'm surprised to see this game doing so well. It's a fun concept and has some nice elements, but I felt there were some glaring balance issues. For one, the cheap costs of the East coast leave no reason to go West, young man. You'd be better off paying an extra $5 to set up shop in a town occupied by another player than spend the $25 expansion costs of the Rocky Mountain area.

However, I am a sucker for any game that allows the players to interact with each other (i.e. auctions). It brings in a lot of business strategy- buying players out of the coal market, for example.

A very good game, that I enjoy playing, but never have "fun".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Good game with 4-6 players. Doesn't work with two players (even with the Robots expansion), and just play something else with three players.

I like the gameplay and the simplicity. The stock market is straightforward and the different phases of the game are easy to understand. Upgrading your power plants to be more efficient gives you a real sense of progression. The game also tends to be pretty quick, with even a five or six-player game taking around two hours.

On the downside, there's a lot of luck in the game and it's very mathy. The luck is in the form of what power plants are available for auction each turn. Sometimes you just can't get the thing you need, and other times a player goes last and gets a great plant for cheap just by pure luck of the draw.
The mathiness isn't too big of a problem, but the last round or two can go for quite a while as players run through all of the different calculations to determine the best move.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 4+[/b]
The game needs more players because of the auctions and the buildings. Without competition for those, the tight economy changes for the worse.

This game would probably be a true "10" if I could play it more often.  For some reason, my friends and family don't often request this game so I've probably only played it 3 or 4 times.  However, I love the auctions and the unique balancing of turn order, prices, etc.

Now, I understand the attraction!  Played the first time and lost terribly.

Oh Germans, the only people in the world that can make a game out of bureaucracy and utility services.  That said, I really enjoy this game (maybe I'm secretly German); great balance between map expansion (buying connections into cities) and "elektro-generating" engine upgrades (i.e. better power plants).  The game's premise, however, makes it difficult to convince others to learn and play, unless they're German or über-geeky.

Finally got another play in after a long silence. Its just as great as before. Very tight, very competitive, and every single decision is make or break. 

It is interesting however that trying to get first place and coming up short will almost always ensure you get crushed in placing (E.g. I could have secured a guaranteed 3rd place but would have had no shot to win, but I went for 1st and got last). Very few games seem to have this, and I'm not complaining, just find it interesting.

This is a game that I can play many times and have a different experience each time. Each play has been satisfying yet left me wanting to play again. All around great and probably will be for the foreseeable future.

So I finally bit the bullet and rated this a "ten". It is *sooooo* good.

An game with mechanics (i.e., the resource market,  the bidding system with a future and current market, the player order) that feel very dynamic and realistic. Only the rules to move from one game fase to another feel rather artificial (I always have to look them up) and the game involves a lot of calculations. For those reasons it takes a bit of effort to get the game on the table, but once it's there it's always a very enjoyable ride.

This is a lovely game. Somehow the mixture of mechanics works really well together. There are always hard decisions to make and never enough information to plan to far ahead. The end game mechanics are abrupt and never feel totally right but more often than not produce a nail biting end game. With higher numbers of players there can be a problem with down-time, but you can always use this time to consider your plans and adjust as people make their moves.

This is a fine, fine game. It has a devoted following and earns it by creating a contest rich with decisions and player interactions.  Sometimes when I play, the game bottlenecks a little getting from Step 2 to Step 3.  Not sure if it's because of equal skill (or total lack of skill) with the players or if it's a consistent design problem with groups.  But I rarely will step away from a table that this is on, mostly because it has that network building mechanic I do love so much.

I'd probably rate this a 10 if it played faster...which means it's rating might go up as the people I play with get better.  I really like how the different strategic elements come together for the game.  It plays really well, and keeps things interesting throughout.  But really, ultimately, this game is just inexplicably fun.  I really simply enjoy the actions that I'm taking as I play the game.

Some of the shine is starting to come off this game. At first I loved the mechanic to stop the runaway leader, but now I find myself increasingly frustrated by it. Getting in the lead can be a burden.

I still enjoy Power Grid and I use it as a gateway game. Newcomers appreciate the phases. A power plant needs resources, and power plants need something to power.... the idea of the game is quite intuitive.

All my recent plays have been with my son, who really enjoys this game. Six people felt slow and methodical, but I've really enjoyed the two player games. I need to get in a four player game again, too. It's been a while. Some recent plays recorded on the expansion board sets. I find it interesting the number of people who don't like this as a two-player game, because I really enjoy it. The bidding is more like a negotiation than bidding. In fact, I usually play it out that way rather than bidding.

Really fun, requires folks to be constantly paying attention to each person's every move; strategy is key, usually thinking about things one and two turns ahead.  Takes about two turns to pick up.  Each expansion map adjusts the rules just slightly enough that it doesn't detract too much from the original concept, while requiring you to rethink your tactics.  Basically zero theme.

I really like the auction aspect of the game, as well as the raw material purchase/use phases. Starting area selection seems to be critical and being in a position early for blocking seems to be a strong strategy. I have a strong dislike for the end game, it seems clunky and awkward.

Great Balanced game. Cool economics mechanism for supply, and a decent auction mechanism which can be trickier than it appears. In the last game I played, I was able to get the 33 plant (green -> 4 cities) in an early round due to the other players buying everything else and the futures market being stacked with high numbered plants. The end game consisted of a bunch of plants in the teens which nobody needed. I won right before phase three started.

I find this game to be particularly unintuitive.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but getting a feel for the real value of the power plants and the inflation of money takes some time.  Given the length of the game compared to how much sheer fun I get out of it, I'm not sure that's time I'm willing to invest.  Also, the numerous fiddly rules that are easy to forget (mainly for removing power plants at various stages) don't help matters.

On the plus side, the idea of polluting the world with coal and garbage is quite appealing.

First Impression: 

A classic mathematical euro.

I love the market system and the auction system seems just right. Mechanics are well connected to the theme. Overall the game has solid design.

I dislike how abruptly the game seems to end. The overall gameplay is also too mathematical for me.

Really well balanced game, it is always really close at the end.  The game becomes harder for the people in the lead, and easier for the people lagging behind.  This has lead to the interesting strategy of lagging behind on purpose and stocking up on enough resources to jump to the lead at the last moment.  

Good playtime, roughly two hours.  

Downside:  Lots of math.  Continually adding, subtracting, and dividing.  Not a game for a tired mind.

Great game with a fun little bid auction and power plant control. Good mechanics to try and keep the game on an even playing field but a leader can emerge and take off which can be a problem. For those that have a little difficulty with math you may want to have a little calculator with you as you will have to do around 35-50 simple computations during the lenth of the game. (That's if your not trying to calculate where your opponents stand as well. Most games i have no problem having a pretty good idea as to where they stand but in a 5 player game of power grid i start to loose track)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Brilliant game.  The various mechanics -- auction, resource market, network building, turn order manipulation -- work seamlessly together.  Because of the different maps, different regions used, and different order of power plant appearances, each game plays out differently.  The only part that can get a bit scripted is the opening auction, but the considerations there change somewhat based on number of players.  I've downgraded my rating from 10 to 9 mainly because I now consider some other economic games to be at least PG's equal.

Ratings by number of players:
2 players: 5
3 players: 8
4 players: 9
5 players: 9
6 players: 8

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This one pains me a bit. The theme is so cool! The way the price of the ressources change depending on supply and demand! Very awesome!

However!! There are some unfortunate downsides.

-In a competitive game, you are never ever going to get or see the most expensive and cool power plant. It is way to easy to end the game before this and if you waste your time saving up for something good - you've already lost before you even get to buy it. 
-The money, oh God the money. Paper crap and fiddleliness. If you don't like simple calculations - all the time - you are not going to like this one.  

Not sure about this one - I wish a more balanced game with better management of the money would come out, otherwise it's a great great game.

Is it a fun game?  A lot of decisions to make.  The game's decisions must be made off of the other players inside of the frame work of the game.  The supply and demand dictating the prices of the game have left me quite impressed.  Although impressed, I don't have a fire in my belly to play right away.  I wish there was more of playing the players instead of playing the system.  There is auctions, but it just don't feel like my   place in the finish is based off my reactions to the other players, and its more based off of my reactions to the gaming system.  Nice solid game, but I think I'm missing on how this could be someone's favorite, unlike other highly rated games I'm not gaga over.  Can have brutal downtime.

I've had really good experiences with this game... and really bad experiences with this game.  Most of my issues with the game(downtime, overly fiddly with the money, counterintuitive end game) seems magnified with six, and a bit with five.  

I know its a feature and not a bug, but the end game situations where the player has no resources to buy always deflates the entire experience for me.

SOLD (11/15/08) --- This game was #1 on my wishlist during the spring of 2005.  I was eagerly looking forward to getting it after reading everything about it available on BGG.  For some reason though, while I certainly respect it as a well designed game, I don't find myself enjoying playing it.  I think it has something to do with both the pieces and the rules being particularly fiddly.  The game seems rather dry, and is a lot of work to play from round to round.  Finally, I severely dislike the "catch-up" mechanism for preventing a runaway leader and ensuring that every single game is extremely close.  Nonetheless, I give this game an 8.  This is somewhat analogous to how I respect the works of Mozart and Beethoven, but don't enjoy listening to them.  This game certainly isn't on that level, but it is a great game, that I just don't personally like to play very much -- UPDATE: Lowered rating to a 6 after another play that I didn't enjoy.

The engineers dream. So mathy. This game is all about optimization, deciding what move is best. Will that next power plant be worth what the bidding is approaching? Where do I expand next? It is quite fun, and the theme is awesome. Who hasn't wanted to run a power generation empire. Or is it just me... One part of the map is baaad for color blindness though.

The game flow is very cool. Everyone has fun and gets multiple chances to improve their strategy throughout because of the way the game penalizes the leaders. This is a good thing because the length of the game would leave many people angry for a long time if this was the case.

When the game begins to wrap up, the leader is usually apparent and everyone just kind of plays to give that person their rightful victory. That part of the game isn't so fun.

Solid game, plays well, mechanically simple.

Many decisions in the game are mathematically obvious, which can sometimes be tedious, however there's often opportunities to inflate prices for your opponent during resource buying / bidding, and this is where the bulk of the strategy comes in.

Overall a good game, although a bit slower than I like.

Just beautiful.  I love this game.

The board is beautiful, and two-sided to boot!  The cards have cool graphics.  And the game is just brilliant.

The idea of reversing player order for different phases is just fabulous.  It makes the game more even, but more fun too.

The auction system is fun.  Do I buy a plant now, and give the next better one to another player, or should I wait and bid on the next one?

Balancing money between three systems - power plants, city expansions, and resources - versus returns (powered up cities), adds depth without needing more rules or complexity.

Brilliant in its simplicity and depth at the same time.  I'm not close to discovering everything about this game yet, and I think that's what I love the most.

[b]Power Grid[/b] rose in my preferences, going from a 6 to a solid 7 after more plays, as my first experience wasn't a good one. However, once the proper rules were in place and the mindset was correct, the game flow is very good.

There is tension throughout the game, in almost all parts of it: the bidding for power plants, the acquisition of resources and the building of plants. Everything has a weight to it and must be taken into consideration, as the game doesn't allow for much room to mistakes: usually, once wrong purchase can be enough to lose the game, as more than one play was decided by some measly bucks.

And smart game, one that I reccommend easily.

A wonderful resource and money management game, the rules are quite straight forward and easy to learn. You buy power plants and the resources to power them to supply cities with energy; whoever can supply the most cities at the end of the game wins. The whole reversal of turn order for the resource buying and city building sounds a bit illogical at first but it all makes sense in the end and adds to the strategy. The tone is very industrial and gritty in which it is paramount to keep up with your rivals and define your presence on the board, although generally we find it is usually quite close between all players at the end of the game. There is a lot of strategy here and there is increased opportunity for interaction in cock-blocking on more than one front. It's great that the game comes with a reversible board meaning at its base there is more possible variety on offer. There's nothing quite else like it - a really fun game.

Some people I used to play with called this "doing the taxes", but I don't think that's fair. Sure, there is optimizing, but it's much more interactive and engaging than other games of that sort. After playing more on BSW, I can see how a snowball effect occurs - one early misstep can end up costing a great deal. It's also very nice how it can do a lot of the calculation for you, one time-consuming part of the board game. Playing the resource and power plant markets is enjoyable, and trying to position yourself just strong enough is a fun challenge.

The auctions are neat, the changing price markets and rearranging of turn order is fun... Always seems like once someone's in the lead they stick to it because the board doesn't feel evenly distributed.  Even with the turn orders being rearranged it's still all about starting position.  After a 2.5-3 hour game I don't walk away very enthused.

One of these days I want to play this game and love it.

I found this game to be very engaging.  I love how the player order can change from round to round.  The auctions can be as simple as only one person bidding, but can turn into a real bid war.  There are many pieces to think about within each decision and I really enjoyed the whole game.  Even when the game takes time, I don't feel like time is dragging at all.

Despite lack of interactions between players, I liked the general dynamics of this game : power plants building, market resources, shared spaces ont eh map... It is also not as long as many suggests if players manage to plan their own turn in advance.
I also regret the transition between 2nd & 3d phases which may come very quickly and resume the game to a mathematical contest.

one of my favorite games; a great balance of theme and playability.

And the dynamics of competition between the players can be very fun indeed if everyone playing knows what they're doing.

The object of Power Grid is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network gains a predetermined size. In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they use to power their cities.

However, as plants are purchased, newer, more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing, you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.

Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials (coal, oil, garbage, and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the 'renewable' windfarm/ solar plants, which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.

The game is fine.  You have to do so much math just to do a turn.  Why?  That is so arbitrary and unrewarding.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
An decent exercise in "lumpy" investments that is marred by too many worthless plants during the early midgame and, often, too much luck in acquiring the winning plants in the late mid-game.

If the odds favor several good plants showing up but they don't appear, the person who went all in on the only worthwhile plant at the start of round lucks out. 

Alternatively, if a good final plant happens to get turned up late in a round and you're still able to bid on it, then you often win. If not, you lose.  

In the roughly 25% of games where the final plant arrival order doesn't determine who wins, then you often get an endgame with lots of AP and calculations (if money is open) or accidental Kingmaking (if money is closed).

Some of the expansion maps (e.g. France) improve this by making a wider range of the early midgame plants viable, but it doesn't solve the latter problems, imo.

To be fair, I did enjoy exploring Power Grid; I would have rated it a 7 or 8 during my first dozen or so plays before I lost interest in it due to the above issues.

This Friedemann Friese classic balances short term gain with long term planning. The strategy of this game reminds me of Chess. Well-known chess strategies divide chess turns into the opening, middle and end games with different approaches to each. You want to gather resources and expand without ruining your turn order for the opening turns. In the late turns more focus is on the power plants and continuing expansion.

There's probably nothing new to say about Power Grid, but it's a great ride, very tense and tight.  One misstep and you're in dead last, which is a turn off to some people, but I like the pressure it adds to the game.  The design is so tight, that after three plays, I start to wonder if there is a way to be a runaway leader in this game.  Looking forward to playing this game for a long time to come.

If you think math is fun you will like this game.  It simply tests your ability to calculate.  There is an auction aspect but the mechanics for the auction prevent it from having too much of an impact on the game.  The gameboard is incredibly imbalanced and poorly designed.  There are significantly better areas of the board than others.  The game appeals to accountants and people who balance their checkbooks for fun.

I played a copy of this at a friends game night and really enjoyed it.  It is an interesting challenge of auctioning (not something I generally enjoy), area control, and resource management.  There is some interplay between players but also a lot of building your own engine.  It provides a fun puzzle, so I found a used copy that came with the robots expansion and picked it up.  We played it 2 player and it was a lot of fun!

It has some interesting mechanics, but the game drags and you spend too much time just evaluating the math of your situation.

Well, years after its release I was finally able to confirm that this game is just as good as they say. I found the game to be mainly tactical, but with just the right amount of strategy to appeal to me. LOVED that there is so much interaction and so little downtime. Because of this, your opponents cause quite a bit of "turn angst". And, surprisingly, the endscoring with four players can be really, really, close! Plays best with 4 - 6 players.
UPDATE: Played a game in which one of the six players was unable to close the gap between her and the rest of the players from the first half of the first phase. Pretty annoying if you still have 2.5 hours to go. Hope it was a fluke.

What a joy to play this game! Great game with a great theme. Mechanics are a little clunky with prepping the power plant deck and at times, there are runaway leader issues, but game play is tense.  Always a popular game with friends. 

Upon more plays, the game remains a popular favorite. Placement of plants is key to winning the game. Runaway leader issues become less apparent with more experienced folks playing the game.

Still find the power plant deck finnicky. If you screw up the setting up phase, the game is shot.

Very, very solid game. It's a bit dry in comparison to other, heavier euros, but it's very elegantly executed.

Edit: Every time I play this, my esteem for it grows. Every time I play it, I find out new strategies. Even my parents love it!

Edit: After diming the base game, I'm starting to slow down on it. Much of who gets a good lead is determined by where they start on the map (though I did have some really interesting games where I came from behind by controlling the market, that was intriguing!). Who is able to get their most efficient power plant without breaking their bank also feels a bit luck based. 

It's still an extremely elegant game, and very well made. I'm simply cooling after exploring most of what it has to offer.

Taught by BeyondMonopoly and others at PrezCon 04.  Is it possible for a game to be too tight and balanced?  This was a mighty close game, especially with two novices in it.  I heard one player comment that games are always this close.  Is the game so balanced that it plays itself?  I don't think so.  We played with generous people who gave us good advice.  Without useful hints about value vs reward in the game, I do not think Terri and I would have done nearly as well.  After one game, I suspect that Power Grid offers meager but meaningful reward for good play, and I look forward to finding out more when we get our copy.  P.S.  My relative success in my first game was definately the result of good coaching, and not any degree of over-balance.

It's suffered a little bit due to heavy play and in comparison to the superior Age of Steam, my personal connection/economic game of choice.  I like the maps, and it's very well balanced (if leaning towards the "gamey" side with its sort-of hose the leader mechanics).  However,  the power plant gamble can sometimes be frustratingly random, and the hose-the-leader mechanics have, well, unintended consequences.  Namely, they punish too harshly whomever's in front with cities, while giving a complete pass to whoever was lucky enough to pick up an early endgame plant (and yes, I think luck plays a very large part in that).

RATING: 7
I like the concept of upgrading the plants, but I dislike the fact that players deliberately build less cities to stay in last place, just because turn order is so important. I consider games where turn order is so important to be flawed. I also dislike how toward the end of the game, it degrades into computing connection costs repeatedly in order to find the cheapest way to place 5 or so cities on the board. I enjoy tense, strategic decisions, not tedious mathematical exercises with an optimal solution. It makes my head hurt--- not in an enjoyable, cerebral way with agonizing decisions, but in an annoying way that is most similar to taking a long, pointless math test.

Edit: I played this again more than two years later and raised my rating from 4 to 7. Most of my previous concerns were significantly less significant than I remembered them, but what's more, I actually had fun! Although I am pretty sure that I was praying before with some of the rules wrong, Power Grid seemed like a completely different game.

This a pretty cool (area control?) game. My only complaint would be that it seems to reward being strategically behind most of the game, and sniping the lead at the opportune time...the end. On the other hand, taking an early lead and playing 'well' seems to be detrimental. I've only played a few times so my feedback could be off the mark.

Power Grid is the mostly cleaned up version of Funkenschlag.  The good things about it, its a much faster game. The bad thing about it well it seems to be much less forgiving than the original.  With higher payoff there is n push to try to stay  behind for much more than a turn.

Power Grid is a "classic". It needs a bit to get the hang of it, and it meanwhile it may look more like a "dated" game.
The elegance of the rules is one of the most worthy things about the game, however there are lots of little exceptions and adjustments, so you're probably needing to keep a reference sheet near.

Played twice and traded. A solid game, but just did not mesh with my group at all. It was something about auctions (generally not a fan of this mechanic), fragile monopoly money (blech), and the tedium of spending 2-3 hours adding two digit numbers together.

This and Mage Knight, I suppose, have been object lessons for me in not trusting the collective wisdom of BGG rankings.

Overrated.  The dry and unthematic auction is what holds the game in balance (because the elements don't connect well otherwise), and so many games are decided because the right power plant flips at the right time.

One of the expansion maps has rules that include not flipping new plants during an auction phase, and that's a big improvement, but doesn't fix the blah-ness of the rest.

Funkenschlag was a favourite of mine, for a very long time. Until someone in my group started to dislike it, and another calculated every single option before making a move, so it was [i]FUN[/i]kenschlag no more. Well, nowadays my gaming experiences are mostly just two-player.

Since I kept buying all expansions (except the [b][thing=181971]Stock Companies[/thing][/b], but including all Spiel specials) there was always the possibility to play with two, using the [b][thing=108667]Robots[/thing][/b] or the [b][i][url=http://www.2f-spiele.de/spiele/pdf/power_2er_variant_rules.pdf]Against the Trust[/url][/i][/b] variant.

Brilliant tension throughout the game that always keeps you engaged. What PP comes out, who buys what plant, and what does that mean for future turn orders or resource demand?

Most of my plays have been with 3, and I really like it.  The ability to deprive the leader of resources makes the leader have to watch his back at all times and keeps a runaway leader problem in check.  The bidding for the power plants and the way turn order is determined really work well from what I've seen.  With more plays, I still enjoy the game, but my rating has dropped.  It seems too important to avoid the lead until the very end (which is part of strategic positioning).

For those who love investment and auction game, this is one of the best option in the market.  With a very simple mechanism and an outstanding ounce of realism, you find in this game a framework trying to simulate the energy generation market.

RATING: 8
Power companies compete to connect electrical networks. Players balance their bankroll to buy power plants at auction, fuels for their plants, and connect cities to receive income based on the number of cities they can supply. Incorporates a clever supply & demand mechanism for the fuel market and turn order is modified each round to penalize the leaders, keeping games tight. The winner is the player that can supply power to the most cities at game end so money is just a means to an end (but can serve as tie breaker). Theme integration is superb. A medium complexity "gamer's game" that forces players to carefully plan their expenditures from round to round. The low amount of hidden information can be problematic when playing with Analysis Paralysis sufferers. I find it best when the game flows along with players going "by feel" instead of deeply calculating - using hidden player cash reserves helps this along. High replay value is provided by the 2-sided board with multiple areas - expansion boards can also be purchased.

A great multiplayer game that changes based on the number of players (certain conditions change).  Based on the map you use (and you should have more than just the base map), the rules change so it doesn't feel like playing the same game over and over.  There is a slight random element for a few maps (really only the power plant cards), but not enough to make this not a real strategy game.  The game also tries to adjust itself for players who are losing to give them advantages.  You have to get into a mindset that while playing this game it might become clear that there could be a winner early and adjust to prevent this.  You have to balance purchasing power plants with buying resources, and expanding your grid - and to know when to be aggressive and when not to be.

I love this game, an "efficiency engine" where you keep upgrading your power plants to power more cities with fewer resources. I rarely play the game because it is so long, and takes 2 hours. However, there are some tips online to get the game down to a reasonable 45 minutes, making it a game I want to play more often again.

Absolutely one of my favorites.  Every time I play it I enjoy it a little more than the previous time.  High levels of interaction, complex series of choices, and many different game elements to keep track of at once make this game my favorite pure linear efficiency game.  Despite the fact that you're doing essentially the same thing every game, i.e. building the most efficient power grid possible, the different maps, random region selection, and randomization of power plants give the game massive replayability.  This one is a true classic.

A decent game, though the heavy end-game math is very heavy on the Analysis Paralysis.  This can make the last turn or two drag pretty badly.

A clever game, I can see the attraction.  I really enjoyed the auction mechanic.  It's not entirely for me though.  It's a very interesting economic puzzle, but just too much math for me to enjoy on a game level.  It really felt like the tactics and strategy were pretty basic, with a little bit of intrigue during the auction phase.  Other than that, it's whoever can sit there and work out the math the best who is going to win.

I'd play it again if others wanted to, but don't think it's one I'd ever desire to play on my own.

Also, the components are feeling dated.  Mainly the paper money you have to try and keep a secret.

The game is fiddly, remembering to manage the markets is annoying. However, this game is fantastically brilliant (if you don't mind a little arithmetic) and managing all your connections, resources and power plants is challenging. The artwork brings a little fun to a drab theme.

There is a ton of tension in city connections and power plant auctions, and some of the bidding wars are surprising. There's usually a lot of interest in what plants people buy, where they build and what resources they buy, since it usually has a strong effect on your plans.

Quite a unique game, in that many of the mechanics are familiar, but no other game has meshed them all this seamlessly. It's easy for beginners to become a bit frustrated, as it takes a play or two to understand the proper way to balance your money, but once everyone hits a stride, it is a great game. The variety of expansion maps offer unique challenges, and I would definitely recommend picking up one or more when you can find them.

The game that got me gaming.  Bought it for an economics class I teach, and fell head over heels into a hobby I never knew existed.  PowerGrid captures nearly every major element of a capitalist economy and boils it down to a wonderfully playable game, where the winner can claim TRUE monopoly and the losers have only themselves to blame.  With four playable boards, an increasingly relevant theme and drop-dead cerebral gameplay, it simply gets no better than this.

RATING: 9
A simple enough game to entertain people who are new to strategy games, yet dense enough for the most seasoned gamers.

Two observations that can make this game so frustrating and paralyzing, but also make it such a fun challenge:

1. You must always be performing cost-benefit analyses - it may be more beneficial to only power 7 cities than to power 11! It may be nice to have that efficient power plant, but do you really need it for the final turns? If you buy just one more resource, will it paralyze an opponent from powering as many cities as he wants?
2. You must always be thinking of positioning. Building into too many cities may cause you to be first in turn order, and, therefore, last to buy resources. But if you don't build now, will you be blocked off next turn? But maybe you also want one of the plants in the "Future Market", so you don't want to be first in turn order? 

SO MANY DECISIONS.

Whaddaya know, an economic game that's not so dry that all the life is sucked out of it.  Really a masterpiece in design.  Every little bit of this game seems thought out, and the overall game flow mimics a real developing power network.  Themed perfectly.  I'm not so nuts about the high granularity of the money, as change gets counted out frequently, and it gets a little silly counting out amounts of $100+ to the dollar, but that's a small nitpick.  Quite a solid design.  After several games, the strategy of when to lead from the front and when to fall behind is still nonobvious.  I'm not sure that I will ever figure it out.  I do know that I enjoy trying.

Have played the France/Italy and the Central Europe/Benelux maps too! Fun stuff there and the minor rules changes changes things slightly and give it a different "flavour".

A little counter intuitive at times for me - holding back so you get a higher spot in the selection order.  I like the concepts and with quick game players I enjoy it.  There is a lot of adding and math which can slow it down for some players since every dollar counts.

I played this once about ten years ago, don't remember anything of that. I played the deluxe last year, though.

We had six players and we incorrectly used the whole map. Too much downtime. I might play again with 4 players or so. I kind of understand why this is much loved, but for me it feels dry. Might get better with more plays, but it is unlikely to happen.

Rating for RGG's b{[b]Power Grid[/b]}b after one play. I had read so much about this game being too hard that I went into the game a bit afraid, but our session was very friendly and I ended up liking the game a lot. I just didn't like the anti-climatic ending, the game owner bought two houses and declared "I reached 17 cities, the game ends, I won". After a three-hour effort I was expecting a little more fanfare...

Surprisingly disappointing game given how well it runs. Gameplay is simple enough to learn and is heavily reliant on skill and strategy instead of luck. While a great pro, it is also an unfortunate con. Newcomers to the game continually lose to the seasoned players, making it difficult to convince them to go back and play more. Interesting game, but doesn't hold up to other more attractive games in my collection.

Power Grid - who could have thought that running your own electrical power company could be so intense and exciting? I love auctioning in games - and this game give you plenty of it. Also really like that you have to balance your long term strategy with short term tactical moves. There is so many maps - and I want to try them all.

I prefer the game online, where there's no moving of pieces and paper money around and the game goes faster. I'm definitely wary of playing this with over-analyzers who feel compelled to number crunch down to the last dollar at every single decision point (which isn't really necessary most of the time). And of course the luck of the power plant market can seem unfair at times.. but in the end, this is just a fun game to play. The variety from the different boards is also a huge plus. The new power plant deck addresses all of the "issues" with the original. Of course, some of those issues came to characterize the Power Grid gaming experience itself. I like both decks although for beginners I'd definitely pull out the new one.

Shorter, with the game ending near the time Funkenschlag's mid-game begins.  Much better production, too!  The game is a masterful blending of mechanism, but I've had to drop it a point because it's no longer one of those "Will play this anytime!" games.  It seems deterministic and redundant at times.  Still, it's a great economics game, and one that requires a player balancing going first and last at the right times in the game.

Jogão. De início, a temática parece não empolgar muito.

A moral do jogo é construir as cidades, ou subestações ou sei lá, e conseguir suprir todas com energia. Não só isso, deve suprir mais que os adversários.

A sequencia dos jogadores é organizada de acordo com quem tem mais cidades, quem tem a usina melhor, quem tem menos cidades e quem tem a usina pior. Isso determina em cada passo quem começa jogando.

A primeira coisa é a compra de usinas via leilão. Cada jogador pode comprar só uma usina por turno, e cada vez que uma é comprada, entra uma nova para venda. Então vai depender um pouco de sorte, um pouco de quanto de dinheiro tem disponivel para gastar e também da estratégia.

Cada usina tem uma quantidade de recursos necessários para gerar energia e um valor de cidades que abastecerá. As mais baratas gastam mais recursos para abastecer poucas cidades, enquanto que as mais caras gastam pouco ou nenhum recurso para abastecer várias.

Depois que cada um comprou uma usina, ou não quis comprar, o próximo passo é comprar os recursos. São divididos em carvão, óleo, lixo e plutônio ou alguma outra coisa radioativa.
Há uma tabela no tabuleiro, que marca os preços dos recursos. O carvão começa cheio, o óleo quase, o lixo com metade e o plutônio com bem poucos. (Isso no jogo para 6 pessoas) Cada jogador pode comprar somente os tipos de recursos que utiliza em suas usinas, e cada usina pode armazenar até o dobro do que necessita para abastecer as cidades. Por exemplo, se uma usina precisa de 2 carvões para gerar energia, é possível armazenar nela 4 carvões.

Depois que todos compraram recursos, é hora de construir as cidades. O valor pago é o valor da conexão entre uma cidade que já possui e uma outra cidade, que não precisa ser vizinha, pode passar através das cidades sem contruir, pagando os custos das conexões. Não há limite de cidades que podem ser construídas.

O próximo passo é consumir os recursos para gerar energia. De acordo com a sua usina, e com os recursos disponíveis, cada jogador abastece suas cidades e ganha dinheiro de acordo com a tabela.

Alguns recursos voltam para a venda, de acordo com a fase do jogo que está ativa. A usina mais cara na mesa vai para baixo da pilha. A sequência de jogo é organizada, e mais uma rodada começa.

Eu gostei muito, a parte do leilão vai de acordo com que o jogador já está pensando, podendo não gastar dinheiro para deixar para comprar cidades, ou recursos. A capacidade de estocar poucos recursos também é interessante, já que eles não são muitos.

Por fim, ainda quero jogar muito esse jogo, que é bom, e com mais aprofundamento, parece ser melhor ainda.

Someone walked me through an explanation once and it seemed difficult to follow, but maybe it was because the explanation was rushed.  With the general goodwill toward this game, I've gotta play it sooner or later. If not for the time factor, I'd probably prefer Funkenschlag instead (which I also haven't played, but the additional crayon aspect appeals to me).

I've played it a few times with different people and must admit that it plays much better with four then with three. Something to do with the dynamics of only having three spots in a city to build. It has a delicate balance as with most German games that it's kinda like pacing yourself for the last sprint at the end of the race. Don't get too far behind though, because it's almost impossible to catch back up.

It's not so much a game as it is 2 hours of intense mental thinking.  A real brain burner.  If you love Excel spreadsheets, or take adderall then this game is for you!  When playing it for the first time it will take about 3 turns before you understand what is happening, and seeing a new players face light up as they suddenly understand how all the prices and power plants fit together is very rewarding.  Great game for teaching kids math and planning ahead! 

Also, I would highly recommend the expansion maps, as they don't just change the map, but often the entire rules of the game, creating a new experience for those familiar with the base game.

A past favourite, now replaced by its lighter cousin "Factory Manager"

The reason why I lowered my rating was that the game cannot sustain its suspense and it often breaks down into a general cacophony of conversation between the players unless they are very disciplined, and that simply annoys me. No such thing would ever happen in Agricola.

This game takes a certain type of group in order to be enjoyed.

The auctioning mechanic is going to be way to adversarial for casual players and the generator blocking mechanic plays more like a nuisance than anything else, a one time siphon on someone's resources in a relatively minor way.

I haven't played this game extensively so maybe I'm not fully experiencing it.  But for the groups that I play with it plays like a long dragged out string of conflicts.  So maybe it's great if that's the kind of game you enjoy.

The object of Power Grid is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network gains a predetermined size. In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they use to power their cities.
\13\\13\
However, as plants are purchased, newer, more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing, you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.
\13\\13\
Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials (coal, oil, garbage, and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the 'renewable' windfarm/ solar plants, which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.

The game is enjoyable in the beginning, but playing to win near the end always results in ordeals where there are several lines of play and you have to add up costs in your head for each one.

This is my favorite quote about Friedemann Friese and it sums up what I like about Power Grid rather well. "If Knizia is a mathematician, then Friese is an engineer. If Knizia is the master of theory and logic, then Friese is the master of rigging and patch-work." [i]From:[/i] http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/392410/steampunk-abomination

It seems like the entire game has been cobbled together from spare parts. The way turn order jumps around, the weirdly wordy and complicated rules for beginning Steps 2 and 3, the need to add and remove various plants from the auction row when certain conditions are met and the ebb and flow of resource availability all function to force a tight game. It seems so clumsy that you almost have to believe the final game evolved from a mountain of playtesting and Friese constantly hammering out fixes by the seat of his pants..

That's not to say that the game doesn't move smoothly. Part of what I like about Power Grid is that you almost have to play it by feel. There is a certain rhythm to the game that can't really be taught. You have to know when to lay back and when to surge ahead. It's a great vibe. There's some validity to the complaints that for most of the game you are actively competeing for last place and that Analysis Paralysis can set in during the closing rounds. I figure that slow playing for the lead is just a viable strategy of the game, not a flaw. As for the AP, what deep economic strategy game doesn't incur it?

A great game that I wish I got play it more often!

My favorite modern boardgame (I guess defining "modern" as "in my lifetime"). I love virtually everything about this game. The auction, resource management and area control aspects work seamlessly together and all feel fully realized. Even manipulating turn order is an important strategic consideration. There's just enough randomness to it to ensure a different experience each time, and the regions concept makes for the least static non-modular board I've ever seen in a game. If there's anything I don't like, it's that the last turn often takes forever due to the small calculations each player has to make (and the nature of the game means it's not practical to do these during the downtime), but this is a very minor gripe with a wonder of a game.

Kind of reminds me of a rail game. I love the bidding aspects, planning, layout, heck everything. Great game.

Lowered rating from a 9 to a 7. I like it but just don't reach to play it.

Excellent game of network building and money/resource management. Cash is tight so you need to optimize. Players bid for power plant and then build their network and get resources in order from worst to best. Great game that I'd love to play again.

Power Grid didn't seem to be as dry of a game as others claim, but I can see it has that potential. We had a "designated resource-replacer" and a banker both times I've played, which makes certain phases much easier. The battles for plants and locations can drag on a bit, though.

RATING: 9
Three simple mechanics converge to make a deeply engrossing game that requires subtle manoeuvring, careful decision making and perfect timing to win. I love this game! It's also easy (but not easy to master of course) and only takes two hours of enjoyable time to play.

A played first sparks recently, it is virtually the same game but with perhaps a little more appealing theme and its also a little more forgiving. I still prefer Power Grid and the games are two close to have both in your collection (although obviously I'm tempted!).

Fine game, but a bit heavy on the repetitive math. Also perhaps a bit heavy on the draw-the-right-plant-at-the-right-time characteristic, but I can live with it.  Love the interactions of all the phases, which look disjointed at first, but are really nicely interwoven. Very clever design, but I have to admit it's fading for me. All of the interest is in the auction, and in the market. The map is close to irrelevant, and that's really unfortunate.  I wish they had converted the original into a hex-grid/tile-based game instead of removing all the layout decisions.

Some of the best mechanics I've found in a game. Almost no luck element and very very interactive.

It realistically mimics a supply and demand marketplace with popular things becoming expensive and neglected things becoming cheap. You fight tooth and nail in the bidding wars bringing up the price of plants to more then their worth to spite your opponents.

Generally just wonderfully made

A great number-cruncher.  Despite it's relative complexity and weight, this one always seems to be a big hit with non/casual gamers as well.  I guess people just like buying power plants and burning garbage.

Mechanically, the game is really clever.  The way the resource market works is really cool, and I love how you can get a glimpse of plants which may hit the market soon, but you can never be completely sure when they will be available.

One huge failing graphic design-wise, I think, is not having the market replenishing numbers or the "Step 2" and "Step 3" conditions and actions printed anywhere but in the rule book.  It's a bad sign when you still need to refer to the rule book after a dozen plays.  I think there are some good reference card solutions here on the 'geek, so it'd be worth checking those out.

A classic that couldn't be ignored in our collection. Especially if you can strike a good deal, together with two expansions.

Although the math can scare players off, at heart a simple and intuitive game. Three phases; bidding at auction, speculating on resources, and expansion of holdings plus a more subtle fourth: manipulating the turn order all are exciting. A lot of player interaction! Scales fine for three, but works better in larger groups.

Finally played this gem, and I must say that I like it a lot.  This has moved up to the Must Have category on my wish list.  I like the random power plants to add some variety, as well as the region draft at the beginning (although I bet the same regions tend to get drafted).  I like the purchasing of the resources as this can lead you to try and corner the market on certain types of power plants based upon fuel type.  All in all a wonderful game.

RATING: 9
The downsides - the board is a flimsy bit of card which has to be curled in half to fit into the box, and the game is a bit too long to get played regularly. The upside - it's a very good game. The auction, route planning and money management systems mesh well together and give a tense game. Update after playing the new edition once. The game is now quite a bit shorter, finishing in less than 2 hours, and the components are now top notch.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A classic economic euro game with a very interesting market mechanism. The rules are rather straightforward but the decisions made during the game aren't easy - you have to carefully manage your resources and money and know when to expand and modernize your infrastructure.

The downside is that Power Grid needs 5-6 players to reach its full potential, don't even bother playing it with 2 or 3, it just doesn't work (4 is an absolute minimum). Another issue I have with this game is its length - it can exceed 2 hours and sometimes it overstays its welcome, especially when you have AP prone players in your group. Other than that - it's a classic for a reason. Definitely give it a try.

[b]/update, January 2018:[/b] Downgraded from 8 to 7. I really like this game, but it's just too long and there's too much upkeep with all the different phases, especially when it comes to replenishing power plants and the resource market. I have to check the rulebook every time I revisit this game. Power Grid is a bit too procedural when compared to some other economic games. It's a good game, but there are simply better ones in the genre with similar playtime (Brass replaced it completely for me).

Neat game - currently my favorite "heavy" boardgame.  Very thematic.   Tons of math,  and lots of jockeying for turn position.  

Box is big,  with a large, colourful board and lots of wooden pieces.  Insert is basically a big well, and all the tokens are in two large bags that actually don't take up much space, so when you open it up,  you don't actually see all that much (in comparison to opening up, say, Arkham Horror or Lord of the Rings.   Only 5 reference cards for a max 6 player game is an odd decision.  This will definitely end up rating high.  

Every action is simplified,  but feels true to the theme - auctions for the power plants,  the increasing price of resources ,  the route building / blocking on the map.    Using money,  although true to the theme,  does make the game a bit fiddlier than it might have otherwise been.   Only things left would be trading (maybe after/during the resource purchase phase,  people would be allowed to trade - resources?  power plants?  cities?) and maybe a bank loan/city mortgage for those times you're a buck short.

Playing to 7 cities (and planning for it!) isn't actually a bad compromise when you want a shorter game,  although only seeing the big power plants and never getting to buy them is a bit of a tease.

Only caveat with this game is you need someone experienced and meticulous for the fiddly bits - the five million special cases on starting Step 2 and Step 3,  and the power plant cycling is a little annoying.

I mainly play this as a two player game with my wife.  We've decided to play until someone can power all 21 cities, instead of how the rules are stated.  If you play only until someone has build 21 cities, it makes more sense to just stop building in Step 2 and save up your money (again, in the two player game).  Not that this is a bad thing, it just makes it a game we were not intending to play.  We hope that the rule change will save this game for us (we have yet to play it)

Tras varias partidas online y alguna en tablero, puedo decir que es un grandísimo juego para 4 o más jugadores. Gestión de recursos, economía, subastas y conexión de ciudades. A destacar con una excelente fase de subasta, una arriesgada fase de compra de recursos en un mercado variable y otra fase de conexión estratégica de ciudades, Alta Tensión es una de las mejores opciones para 4, 5 o 6 jugadores. Reglas y estructura de juego sencillos, pero con una estrategia y profundidad únicos. Muy matemático y psicológico en determinados momentos. Con mazo de Nuevas Centrales Eléctricas, el Condensador de Fluzo y el Mapa de Brasil/España y Portugal. Con fundas cuadradas tamaño 70x70mm.

Excellent planning game with a very fitting and fun theme. Explaining the game using the theme really makes it easy. Note that playing with people who count every possibility can lead to some downtime. The rules can be a little fiddly and I recommend postponing some rules (when to remove a plant at certain steps) until the actual play when playing with new players. Although this is a gamer's game, I think non-gamers can grasp this game fairly quickly. This is a game that really needs a quick overview sheet. I recommend either http://www.boardgamegeek.com/fileinfo.php?fileid=15138 (PowerGridInfoSheet.pdf) or http://www.boardgamegeek.com/fileinfo.php?fileid=13186 (Power Grid step-based game summary.pdf) here on BGG.

Difficult and meaningful decisions all around and the different mechanics of the game (network building / area control, power plant auction, fuel market) all interconnect seamlessly and you need to balance all three and also look out for other players.

[b]Update:[/b]New rating 8. I fear that the rating will go down, since I really loved it the first time I played it, yet the second one didn't even nearly fulfil my expectancies of replayability. The combination of luck (as the power plants come) and rather stubborn mathematical optimization with little interaction and high down-time, low learning curve. Moreover, we had a king making problem in our second play.Will try again soon and see if this second time was rather an unfortunate play or if it's in the game...
[b]Update:[/b]New rating: 8.5 My fears did not come true. Subsequent plays convinced me that it's not stubborn mathematical optimization, it's more subtle. However, king making is still a bit of a problem and it's probably not the perfect game for my standard group.

Can sometimes bog down if multiple players are painstakingly trying to figure out their best optimized move every single time.  But with the right group it's a fun play and a decent but not overwhelming mental workout.

**Note we don't bother trying to play with true hidden money--we don't require people to say how much they have but we aren't paranoid about trying to actively hide it.

Also, I love all the components and artwork EXCEPT for the small, cheap, ridiculous currency.  That robs it of the borderline 8 for me.  You use the currency constantly, it shouldn't be the WORST component you include.

I really like this game.  I like the theme (c'mon? buying Uranium for nuclear plants a la Mr. Burns!!!).  My main gaming buddy does not like this because he dislikes games where you cannot plan strategy from the get go (in PG, it seems you are always just making the optimal move at that point and can rarely plan ahead).  Love it love it!

Overall a good game with a neat theme.  We always seem to crack jokes about how environmentally friendly or unfriendly our groups of power plants are.  The hardest part of learning the game is dealing with the player order mechanics, which are a bit different.

I really enjoyed the bidding for power stations and planning out different resource options.

I sold my copy off to a friend after two plays.

Intensely involved game which sees all players partake in a charged hustle to outmaneuver, outbid, and outwit each other. NOTE: No time for lollygagging here. You must succumb immediately to PG's move-plotting mania or else you will fall behind when building and linking your power plants. Warning: This game is high energy. Win or lose, the inevitable brain drain you will experience by game's end is all worthwhile.

My only negative comment: The game's graphics, which have a cartoonish Simpsons-esque quality, don't quite match up to the game's high-powered theme. Although they have grown on me...

A love it or hate it bookkeeping game that drags you in with its excellent components. There are mechanisms in place that prevent a runaway leader, which will suit some people better than others.

On most days, I'd prefer to play Puerto Rico instead.

Don't let this game's boring 50's style fool you.  Think of Fallout 3: 50's style, awesome game!  What I really love about this game is that it's super easy to understand.  Unlike many other board games, you open the box and it's ready to go.  No punching hundreds of gold, terrain hexes, food, buildings, or any other cardboard pieces out of a few dozen sheets the first time you open the box.  This game is all strategy with few rules and complexities.  And the game isn't over until it's over.  The person in last place for most of the game can win it in the end (which is actually a top strategy in this game, since the person in last usually goes first each round.)  The rules are simple, the expansions are simple, there are few moving parts; this game is just fun and ideal for new gamers.

The catch-up mechanic is the thing that is what makes this game so great, but it can also create situations that drags out the game. Decent game that can be fun with the right group of people. The game needs some expansions to enjoy it after 5 plays since the base game can be a little repetitive.

This is a great, thinky, heavy game about building a power grid.  Players compete to buy power plants in auction, build a power grid, and buy fuel for the plants.  The game is essentially a race to get a number of cities connected to your grid and to power as many of them as possible.  A game of supply & demand, competition can drive prices sky high.  

A brilliant part of this game is that players in last place are given some specific turn-order advantages for buying fuel and extending their power grids.  This feature makes timing a critical component of the game, and helps disadvantaged players to get stronger.

Man, I wish this game had a better ending. It's such a great design that plays so nicely right up until the very last couple turns. I really dislike the leapfroggy conclusion for such a long game.  I've had plenty of plays that have left me salty.  I'll feel like I'm doing the right thing the whole game and staying behind and piling up my money only to get screwed by a city placement, resource that sells out, or lack of 7-value power plant on the last turn.  

It's possible that I'm just bad at this game, but I think I'm done with it unless someone really wants to play it.  Both Power Grid and Copycat have infuriated me with their end game.

Power Grid is inmiddels een echte klassieker, maar jammergenoeg kan het mij niet helemaal bekoren.

Ik heb spellen gespeeld die langer duren dan deze, maar bij geen enkel ander spel heb ik het gevoel gehad dat het te lang duurt, behalve bij deze. HEt spel is leuk en uitdagend, maar voelt vooral tegen het einde wat repititief aan, terwijl dit juist de climax hoort te zijn.

I'd like to continue playing. This game would be a solid 9-10 if not for my perception of imbalance on the maps and how much initial positioning can determine the winner of a game. It also is somewhat prone to kingmaking in my opinion. 

That may be a strong statement, I guess it might be more accurate to say that the last place players sometimes have a bigger impact on who wins than the first place players.

RATING: 8.3
Finally got to play this. It was as good as I had expected I guess although I found it to be very unforgiving for people learning the game as falling behind too much (not 'that' much) means that it feels impossible to catch up and it gets to the point where there is no point in continuing as you know there is nothing you can do. I prefer games to feel a bit more tense until the end and with people who don't necessarily have much experience with the game. I know there is a 'catch-up' mechanic in the game but I feel that only helps if you consistently stay within sight of the people in front. I suspect that a number of plays would be required to help alleviate this and I can't see that happening for me (as I don't tend to focus on just one game enough).
I also only played with 3 players which may change things.
It's still a great fun game that despite struggling to get to the table often, I'd still rate highly.
On a side note, I am not the biggest fan of the components. Cards are flimsy and ugly and the board isn't very nice but this only shows how much of a difference good gameplay is. I think I would prefer the deluxe version despite my research on which version people recommend having put me off it in favour of the original; but only if I could get the deluxe for not too much more money than the original.

Very engaging.  Players have a great degree of freedom without being overwhelmed by choices.  Very little down time.  Well balanced.  Great but simple supply and demand system.  You feel that you are really matching wits with your opponents:  What is the best way to manipulate the market?  How much can you bid on that plant and still execute your expansion plan?  Is your opponent bidding you up, or do they really want that plant?  Some arithmetic is necessary to do well.

Power grid is an awesome economic game.  I love all of the dynamics in the game and the balancing act of buying new power stations, more resources, and getting new cities.  I love how the resources get more expensive as they get scarcer which means that there is a lot of strategy involved in using resources that nobody else wants, or buying up a bunch of resources to make it more expensive for your opponents.

You know a game is good when you are surprised that the game took as long as it did.  This one consistently feels short for a longer game.  It is not excessively mathy as others have said.  It has a nice mixture of elements.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Good game, but pretty mathy. Not hard-mathy like calculus, but you're bound to have some people who know the exact value of a particular power station and refuse to go over that value, thereby rendering the auctions pointless and boring.

Very cool recycling/catchup mechanism though. Kudos to FF on that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
So. Mathy.

Yes, it's highly rated, and it probably deserves it. But this guy definitely isn't for everyone. While I enjoy it with 3, anymore than that can become a serious drag. It's not uncommon for some players to take between 10-20 minutes on their last turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
After first play it so far looks cluttered, but the whole picture starts to simplify. A lot of calculating is involved, this can be frustrating a bit. After a few more games i have to say, not a bit, but very frustrating, dragging and it doesnt bring so much fun. Probably also depends on a gaming group. And what i don't like the most, is that competition can be very harsh and you are actually devastating someone in his face while picking the goods that you don't need, but you know he needs them badly.

I love how all the mechanics interact and cause the game to flow. However the flow at times does feel artificial in that there are all these little adjustments and card discards that play like tweaks to the game.

Bueno pues tras la primera partida me parece un juego entretenido. Aunque es de 2 a 6 jugadores, veo que cuando se hace más entretenido es si se juega con 3 o 4 jugadores. Lo que no me termina de convencer es lo que determina la victoria del jugador, el que abastezca mas ciudades en el ultimo turno, no se, parece como que el resto de la partida no cuenta nada, a parte de hacerse con las centrales que mayor numero de ciudades suministren. Sera cosa de jugarlo más veces, no se. Otro pequeño detalle que no me gustó, porqué en dos jugadores se acaba la partida al construir uno de ellos 21 centrales si, entre que usas una para un marcador y otra para los turnos, solo se tienen 20 casitas. Pero bueno.

Played with 2 other players who were reluctant to play it but wanted the game to be played once in a while.

It was quite boring ! And with a very wonky end.

So ... I may retry it someday but it's quite unlikely.

An engaging network building game with money and resource management. Like many/most economic games, it can be arithmetic-heavy as you figure out what you can afford to do on any given turn. The rules are tricky and easy to screw up but flow nicely once you get used to them. The rules to simulate a regulated, competitive market add indirect interaction (in addition to the direct interaction of the power plant auctions) as well as clever maneuvering and come-from-behind victories.

My only complaint is that it's got a lot of fiddly rules that are easy to forget when you haven't played in while, and which aren't sufficiently emphasized in the rules, for instance discarding the highest-valued power plant after each auction phase during Step 1.

While there isn't anything fundamentally wrong with the game, it just doesn't click in with me as a stellar must-play game.  I like games with a lot of different strategy options, but with Power Grid it feels like I have two choices only... buy a plant now or later and should I buy a city now or later.  While this is interesting for a few games, it gets old quick and is no longer exciting for me.

RATING: 4
{ P - 3 [4] [5] 6 }

Goldilocks: The Board Game. It seems like once every blue moon I play the game Power Grid was intended to be, where nobody gouges the supply/demand economy (increasing the price for everyone reliant on the resource) but remains at the bottom of the lineup, and the map doesn't produce overcrowding at the start - effectively eliminating those players - while allowing backyard properties for others (prefer France, U.S. with Brown/Yellow/Red/Green, Benelux, mostly hate the rest), and some crap pull doesn't stagnate the power plant market, usually trash plants or low plants after a glut of high ones - and players sit around with little to do. (Especially bad if someone lucks into a 5-6 THEN the crap hits, more or less giving the game away.) Even the instances where those three elements coincide still seem problematic. Every game I can remember has always had a must-gamble-to-win situation; because players are always aiming for the best/highest plants, low ones accumulate near the bottom and sooner or later every replacement is gambling. There's also a fiddly dilemma where players are required to "know their roles" in order to play a good game, and if someone doesn't realize he or she should be the person pushing the enevelope when it comes to city expansion the game can balk while waiting for Stage 2. (Many times, nobody wants to actually trigger Stage 2 for fear of getting blocked in, and as money accumulates this fear only worsens.) Still probably the best gateway game ever, unless you think Settlers and Carcassonne actually qualify as games.

Cool game. Nice mechanics and clear instruction manual. Quite streamlined. Only it's quite a lot of calculating once you get near the end. If you want to plan ahead to figure out your win options, be prepared to crack your brain. 

The strength definitely is that it's not a race, but balancing out and plan when to build your power plants, your connections and when or what resources to buy on the ever changing market.  

The artwork is a bit mwoah ... doesn't really appeal to me. But the new (special) edition is even less interesting.

For a game that I enjoy as much as I do, and one that is as streamlined as it is, I don't know why I haven't played this one more? I love how all the steps in the game play out and how the game itself evolves from beginning to end.

How the initial auctioning of the power plants affects who buys commodities first and then placement of the cities is genius. And how the market changes over time and you have this ebb and flow of grabbing commodities, flipping of power plants and then grabbing of new cheaper commodities is great. The game tends to have these kinds of bursts of expansion as cities get built, blocking what others can do until certain stages in the game, and then the floodgates open and the cycle continues.

For a game that is as simple as it is mechanically, it evokes so much strategy. And while the setup is slightly variable in the way that the cards come out and the initial placement of each individual's cities, I think that it's just enough to keep it fresh and interesting. The fact that you can get so many maps for the game and that the player counts can have a drastic effect on how you play, makes this something that I think I'd never get tired of.

Has a lot going on and I find the mix of things that you have to keep track of engages me fully from start to finish. I love the bits and the artwork works for me though noramally that kind of art does not fit my personal aesthetic.Really enjoy the game and it is always tight with many of my games coming down to counting money for two players to determine victory. Unfortunately one of the guys I play has been winning every game for the last few months... damn.  

UPDATE - this game seems to never hit the the table any more. I am downgrading it a tad to reflect this.

Strong theme and nice components.  Plenty of market timing decisions. This is a great, deep game that is marred only by a few rules that seem forced. Basically, the mechanisms for moving between different stages in the game are not intuitive and the first couple games you play will require keeping the rulebook close at hand.

wow i like game a lot.  i've even won it once -- and that was the last time i played it.  i think i've finally got down how to not screw myself in the power plant auctions.  this is the undying game in my collection, and i have since upgraded the rating.  everyone usually wants to play this, and i'm okay with that.  add in a map expansion or two, and this will be good for a long time.  the one main problem i continually have with it, is the randomness of the plants coming up, which can lead to stagnant game situation where no one wants to buy a plant.

RATING: 10
Really my plays are over 100 for this one. We played almost daily for two years in prison on a self-made board and cards that was illustrated from photocopies of the original that my mom sent me. This has one of my favorite economic models, a straightforward auction mechanic, and lean area control. Easily accessible for new players, but deep enough to keep you coming back for more. Over and over. Expansion maps only add to the success of this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The design of this game is very intuitive and much akin to reality. The improvement in efficiency/technology in power plant designs over time, the increasing cost of raw materials if one enters the market later, and the additional costs for entering a city second or third largely makes sense in real life and that makes this game more realistic.

The auctions of power plants, rush for raw materials and blocking potential when building cities creates tension in the game and much player interaction.

The only bit about the game I dislike is the handling of money (My Significant Other and I bought poker chips to replace the money). It can also get quite numerical when one plans ahead and this may turn off some players who prefer something that does not require so much addition and subtraction.

Excellent game, a bit punishing so you have to be careful with turns in order to make optimal play since it's hard to catch up if you get behind.

RATING: 5.5
Mildly impressed after my first playing, but almost seems too "mathy" and analytical for a Euro. Can easily get lost in mathematics trying to optimize your turn. Sometimes it felt that the best move was an equation to solve instead of a strategy to employ, but the integration of all the components and rules is very impressive. Definitely warrants additional playings, but I'd want as few people playing as possible. More people adds far, far too much downtime and the game drags considerably. I don't think I'd ever want to play this with 5 or 6 again as it could easily stretch into 3-4 hours, or longer.

I'm usually not much of a fan of auction games, as they tend to take many repeat plays to come into their own. The players must sort of get comfortable with the economic system of the game in order to correctly value their bids. All this definitely holds true for Power Grid, and leads to my hesitant 7 rating.

I have fun playing it, but simply haven't grokked the game to a level where I can play it well enough to compete. On the other hand, tight scoring games such as this, where it tends to come down to tiebreakers to determine the winner is also a bit of a weak point in my mind, as they can induce massive analysis paralysis. I can see future plays with longer, and longer Building Phases as it is so critical to have a few extra Electrons at any moment.

This game has 2 features I love.   A power plant market up for auction and a resource market for S&D.  The built in supply and demand purchase system ensures a handicap for the trailing players which means that auction bids and smart resource mgt is what ultimately determines the winner.  This is my favorite game by far...highly recommend.

RATING: 7
OK, first of all, I don't think this game deserves the high ranking here on the 'Geek. For that the game simply lacks elegance. It has too many housekeeping rules, and several clunky, gamer-y mechanics, such as the constantly changing turn order mechanic, which, while a crucial part of the tactics of the game, feels just unnatural and contrived. Furthermore, there's just too much downtime and a too long playing time when played with six players.All that aside, at the core this is a very interesting game. I enjoyed building up my network and the balancing act of purchasing plants and acquiring raw materials to power my cities. I just wish that somehow the game was more streamlined to bring the interesting stuff more to the forefront and keep the extraneous stuff to a minimum.

RATING: 8
Finally got to play this gem recently, and the experience was made even better by being taught (rather than learning it myself) as well as having a full complement of 6 players.  Lots of strategy and manuevering.  When to purchase and when to pass, when to upbid and when to give up.  Each choice you make have reprecussions that will affect you later on.  It is one of those games that you wish you could've, would've or should've done afterwards.  I most certainly will own this eventually, however, since it play best with 5, I probably will not have many chances to get it to the table unless during holiday gatherings or at the boardgame club meetings (it is just hard for me to find 4 other people on a consistent basis).

RATING: 8
Rating based on one playing: I came very close to winning my first game of Power Grid (lost by 1 Elektro or whatever the currency's called) so that helps the rating. :)  Concerned about the unforgiveness of the game; does a slow start mean you have no chance of victory?  Time will tell... Rating update from 8 to 9 after three more playings on BSW: I like this more and more the more I play.  A slow start doesn't necessarily mean that you're out of the running, from what I've (now) seen.  A wonderful design that I like playing a lot. Update again: back down to 8, due to the very unforgiving nature of the game.  If you get behind, you can play out the second half of the game without having a chance to win.  Where's the fun in that?

The worst part of the game is the instructions. It takes about 20-30 minutes every time to figure out how to play. The book is terribly organized. The game itself is a decent mindless game.

Not the best game.

Awesome game for gamers.  No random chance, great design and simple rules.  A must play for math guys and gals.

Editor's Note:  I want to drop this game to a 3 rating.  I've played 9 games, finishing 2nd 8 times (and somehow getting obliterated once).  I'm like the guy in the "you will never win Power Grid!" palm reader cartoon recently posted on BGG.  Knowing the circumstances of how you will lose three turns before it happens while you have a huge lead is heart-wrenching.

Second editor's note:  I finally won!  However, it took playing Korea and China... both of which I can lay claim to an undefeated record (1 win in each, 0 losses - hah!).  Try to play Power Grid with the new power plant cards, though.  It's a much better game.

After 10+ Plays: One of my very first euros.  I was amazed by simple yet effective supply and demand system of the resources, and that remains my favorite part of the game.

I would have preferred there to be an unlimited number of resources at the highest price point, as in the game Brass.

Was my long-time #1 game, but I think it might finally start falling back a bit. Brilliantly put together game with elegant supply and demand curves that just happen through game dynamics. Last few turns always crescendo nicely, and the game has a good catch-up mechanic. Only downsides are the paper money and the futility you might feel when you know three turns from the end you're in a no win situation. The puts people in behind in a king-maker position, where they can ramp up the cost of a powerplant out of spite, ensuring another player will win. But still, it gives people who are essentially out of it something to do!

One of my favorites. It looks dry but the mechanics are really one of the bests i've seen. You got auctions, you can build, you have a market simulation - hats off to FF for this great game!

A fun, well designed game. The way the mechanic works seems to keep the game pretty close. It's a little fiddly with all the pieces that have to continually be played on the board, and it kind of looks a mess, but it's a good game.

Network building and a really cool fuel market should make it the perfect game for me. However the rubberband mechanic and the random nature of the power plant market makes the game feel very prone to stalling and then the game just becomes tedious.

I must acknowledge this is a good game. Though I felt it is too mathematical to enjoy for me.

Classic. I view this game as a perfect example of simple mechanics coming together to create an extremely solid, strategic and fun board game. While not as complex or involved as some games I really see it as a paragon in the board gaming world and enjoy it immensely.

Some interesting concepts, but beholden to number crunching and ultimately is rarely worth the time investment.

Gateway economic/heavier game, because the theme is so strong, no point salad, just pure theme and numbers. The paper money sucks, but its forgivable.

I vacilated between giving this a 9 or a 10.  My only hesitation - and I stress the word "only" - is the length of play.  Still, a great game that I will never turn down.

Power plant auctions. Being in front isn't always the best thing. Bashes the leader a bit too much.

The mechanics is simply great. What power plants to buy and for what price? What resources and how much? Decisions, decisions..

An involved game that challenges its players and, after 2+ hours, can leave one tired from processing and calculating. As an infrequent affair, it is excellent and well balanced.

Pros: One of the best economic games. Simple in mechanics you'll need your best long-medium term thinking to win.

Con: Sometimes a player can be out of the game after some rounds.

Cool power plant cards, deep strategy and money management. Pretty math heavy though, gotta have the energy for it.

The one time I played this, I was pretty bored and looking forward to the game being over.  Not sure what a second play would yield, but not really looking for one either.

Finally got to play a complete game. It is actually superb, but with a horrible rulebook.
Still, I would play it again no question.

While I like the mechanics of the resource market, this game leaves me a bit cold.  You need to have 4+ players to get the most out of it.  The worst of it for me is the mathematical analysis paralysis that it induces in me and the fact that early mistakes pretty much put you out of this game (which make it essential to work out the math... which leads to AP).

I really enjoy this game.  The supply/demand economics are well-represented, the paper money gives it an old-school feel, and the overall game mechanics are quite fun.  Plus, I'm glad it provides a map of Germany, as I prefer that to the map of the US (I'm a Europhile).

个人观点，BGG前十位中最名不副实的游戏，属于精算类游戏，游戏绝大多数时间在算个人账。然而各种地图扩展的不同特点提升了游戏的耐玩性，作为入门级经济游戏来说还是不错的，对其频繁的找零纸币有点厌倦

This game is THE favorite game of multiple members of my gaming group. 

Power Grid has everything a good meaty game should have. High skill/luck ratio. Varied play, lots of player interaction, relatively low downtime, and proper handicap that assists lagging players to keep the game even.

The unique theme and solid materials makes the game feel high quality. 

Even after many plays, we come up with new strategies for winning, and available expansions keep the maps fresh.

The only downside is the higher learning curve and amount of rules. This is a barrier that scares off non-gamers and this game has to be worked up to. Its meatiness is both its greatest strength and weakness. Be prepared for 2 hour games.

I'd give this a 9 or 10, but it's a bit weak with two players, and there's a lot of initial rules explanation to get new players in.

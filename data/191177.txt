A tableau builder in which you try to build engines in four different categories. The way in which cards are drafted is the most interesting part of the game.  Each turn all players add a single card to the "universe" of available cards.  The cards are sorted by category before all players choose an action card that shows the category of card they will take and how much they would like to choose ahead of others who selected that category.    Add a card to your tableau and visible actions on all other cards in that category are triggered.  The efects of cards drafted early in the round can change what's left for others for the worse. A diminishing choice of action cards mean that you can't specialise in one or two categories.  While that helps to reduce downtime spent waiting for an opponent to complete a long string of actions, it does feel as if your options are fairly constrained.  

It strikes me that I have used some pretty abstract terms to describe Space Race.  There isn't that sense of progression  from Runaway Robots to the New Galactic Order that Race for the Galaxy offers because cards have no cost.  Nor are there different decks for different eras of space exploration. From V2 to Mars lander, it's all possible at the same time.

The artwork is very nice, the wooden rocket is cute and the iconography is fairly easy to understand.

Lame name and a bit of an icon blizzard, but don't let that put you off.
Feel a tiny bit like Race for the Galaxy.  But has much more interaction.

Normally I'm not a big fan of engine-building because as soon as your engine is running the game ends. Every time.
Yes there are a few that I like but only if engine-building isn't its only mechanism.

Space Race is such a negative example: a single mechanism game.
Why do I find it at least interesting? Well it has a new twist.

You bid for cards that are placed open in the middle. This is for the most time the only way to get cards into your engine.
Additionally to the bidding you have hand cards, and this is where the twist is.

You can't play cards from your hand. To get them you have to give them away. What?
If you want one of your hand cards in your engine you have to discard it into the middle and bid for it along with everyone else.
So there is always the chance that you want to play a good card but someone jumps into the gap and takes it from you. Good idea.

I'm not sure if this carries the game over many plays but I definitely can appreciate the idea.

I love the theme and artwork, and I love the combo chains! But the gameplay is a little too complicated, and it can be difficult to learn. The rules desperately need some streamlining. I probably would eliminate the lab and just have cards in hand and in your agency. For what it is, the game takes a little too long to play because it is so complicated.

After 3 plays I'm unsure of this game.  The powers accumulated can be confusing when considering your next move resulting in AP.

Takes place during the first seven decades of the space conquest, and players become directors of newly established Space Agencies. Their goal is to expand them and to achieve astonishing breakthroughs. During the game, players will develop their Space Agencies by acquiring various cards (engineers, technologies, space programs) from a shared pool of cards called Universe.

A fun engine builder.  Good replayability and amazing art.  Sometimes the games are pretty swingy and the winner runs away with it.  The theme is fairly independent of mechanisms.  After 5-6 plays, I don't love the "take-that" elements in the game.  They are a small part of the game, but I found them jarring.  Would have rather seen another mechanism for player interaction.

No. Sat down w/ a cup of coffee for the THIRD time since I got this to try to tackle and decipher the game play...and failed for the last time.

Kickstarted because of the art and theme - but the rulebook and iconography break the game before you can even get started. I've tried to learn the game via videos and the rulebook and the iconography is so dense and under-explained in the rulebook that it's impossible to play. It would be easy to fix if they just had a cheat sheet that labeled each icon and what it means -- and they label SOME of them - but not all. They icons actually work like hieroglyphs that you have to read/interpret to understand. A ridiculous ask from someone that's never played the game before. Lazy rulebook and no on-line support re: iconography complaints. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.75
Does not last long enough to make a real game...seven runds seems woefully short.  The artwork is more than outstanding.  However, the gameplay dies not hold it up.  There simply is not enough time to do much meaningful, and the feeling of building a program is totally absent.  I had much higher hopes for this game.  And at thirty Euros for a box of cards, I expected a deeper experience, slow buildups of ideas and development of projects with the goal of a moon landing, but there is not build up at all.  I can launch Sputnik on my first card play if I want.

Early rating. This one is very interesting. The cards in your hand aren't really yours. They're just your share of hidden information about cards that will come up in later generations (rounds). Definitely takes a game or 2 to grok. I'm not sure if this stacks up as well compared to other engine-building card games. But the art is one of the best.

[b]Space Race: The Card Game[/b] was sold via the marketplace 1/11/18.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]My first play of Space Race was a bit rough as we struggled through the rules, but after going home and reading the rules myself I was excited to play again. Space Race reminds me a lot of Race for the Galaxy in so far as you have a hand of cards to play to your tableau and a separate hand of cards which determine player order and which cards you can  select from the common pool. There are a lot of cards to learn and it can feel a bit overwhelming for your first few plays, again similar to Race, but I think it's worth it. 

Finding the combos and figuring out how to make them work is not easy, but it is fun and satisfying once you do. You start the game wit very little to do, but each subsequent round you are triggering more and more powers. The tension in the game comes from the fact that you only have 7 turns to build your engine. My one concern, and it may be a big one, is the potential for AP. Each player has a lab in which you collect cards for points; however there are some cards which let you take cards from [i][u]anyone's[/u][/i] tableau. Since most cards have a different power associated with them it can really bog the game down. Therefore I'll be careful who I play this game with, it's fun for a 1/2 hour not the 1+ hour slog it took to play my first game. I'm lucky because when playing with my son we move along at a fast clip, but this could definitely be an issue for some folks.

I'd still highly recommend checking out Space Race: TCG, especially if you like tableau builders or are interested in Space. The art is amazing, the KS upgrades are legit [i](the wooden rocket used for initiative is sweet)[/i] and the use of historical people and events for the cards is really cool.[/i]

Played a 3p game. Found it very similar to Race for the Galaxy in that you are building a tableau with cards that are used in different phases. What's different and lacking though is the ability to create strong point scoring engines because the game ends just after 7 rounds and you are forced to diversify rather than specialize. 

It's important to get points through the cards as well as through the breakthrough icons while laboratory although slow in generation, can potentially score lots of points as well. 

The winner accumulated large point totals in all 3 areas. 

Think I'd rather play RFTG anyday though.

The mechanic is pretty interesting; can't say I know of many other games similar. The complexity is pretty high and especially for new players it can be a lot to take in. Also takes a few plays to really get the strategy down.
With that all said, there is some serious depth to Space Race and, for the right players, it is a pretty amazing experience. It feels pretty AP but if you play with people not that into the number crunching it can be fun. The theme works really well too.

I think the artwork and graphic are well done. Interesting concept, although it seemed like the engine being built was mainly for initiative in collecting cards, and not for special abilities (for most of the cards), so it didn't feel like I had too much of an engine near the end, especially since the pieces only executed if you played the right colored card, which you may not even have any of those cards in the end.

I only played this two player, though, I want to like this more, so I'll try to get it played with more players.

tl;dr: cool card game

Now here's a cool engine builder with cards. Different cards are triggered in different ways, and chaining them to combine them efficiently is the puzzle to solve here. The basic turn structure is quite straight forward, but good planning is essential so you can set yourself up for future turns. If you know the color that was activated this round won't be activated next round, start building for next round and try and be as efficient as possible.
I quite liked playing this game. If it was slightly cheaper, I'd probably have bought a copy.
A note on the artwork: I like that they chose real people and stuff for the artwork, but I'm not a fan of the art style. The color pallet doesn't appeal to me. But that's personal taste.

Initial rating: 6.7/10

2 simple rule changes that could improve the game flow and enjoyment:
1) Instead of taking turns by players in one stage,  the first player could just go first and do all his/her actions. It already works as follows between stages. Going forth and back within one stage between players just adds clunkiness and confusion but benefits very little.
2) The game has great potential for interesting choices to be made within the Planning phase (phase 1) when choosing your control card based on what is in the Universe, but very quickly the face-up cards run out or thee are only really very few left to make any interesting choice. And the cards you add in the universe add too much randomness in taking them in consideration in the planning (even when you are the only one who knows the cards you added) because:
2.1) You really don't know if your cards show up because there can really be a lot of cards in the universe, at best it is 50-50 that your card(s) even show up
2.2) after that you have to compete for these cards as everyone else, but you had to do the planning before that, so there is actually not much you can do after they are revealed (taking away an interesting choice)
-> So, simple, quick rule change to improve this would be to add at least 1 face-up card in the universe per player at the beginning of each round, so players can make more interesting choices during this step.

PnP version. First impression after teaching "game" is that it has a lot in common with Race for the Galaxy especially on the phase selection/tableau building ideas introduced there.
After the first actual game the game seems like it has potential. Playtime I estimate to 30 minutes but some minor improvements need to happen to make this game a winner. update: Comparing my earlier PnP version to the kickstarter PnP files it appears that the problems have been addressed.

Pleasantly new play feel from [b]Qwixx[/b]. Makes you think in a different way.  It does seem weird to get rid of trash cards.  Looking forward to trying this one again.

Listening to the rules explanation, I wasn't at all enthused.  Qwixx: Das Kartenspiel turned out to be a bit more fun than I expected.  The game poses some interesting hand management, timing and luck pushing questions.  There is a fair dollop of plain old luck too.

Qwixx's artwork is very dull indeed, but at least it is functional.  Production quality is decent.

2017-11-04 : First play. Paying attention to what already got played increases your chances somewhat, but at its heart it's all about luck in getting a run in a color. So a mix of clever play and luck is required, which is absolutely fine for a game of this kind and duration

RATING: 7.5
As is the case with the dicegame we really enjoy this game as well. The possibility to play multiple cards per turns really adds some suspension to the game. You have to pay attention, because your opponent could finish the game sooner than you think.

Nice variation of the classic Qwixx dice game that takes the same idea and interaction to implement them into a system with cards. But we rarely play it as it doesn't play as lightly/flowing.

Prefer the dice game.

What do I love in games: rolling dice and hand management. Which do I love more?  Hard to say, but in a game like Qwixx it seems like the game play is more interesting when there is a bit more luck involved.   

Definitely play with the wild cards to increase your odds of coming across the numbers you need.

RATING: 6.5
This reduces the amount of luck in the game (2's and 12's will appear more reliably. Even though this makes it a better game than the dice version, I still can bring myself to rate this higher. It just feels there are better cardgames out there with the same playing time / weight.

RATING: 7
Nice variant to qwixx, but I like it a little less. With cards the odds to get a twelve or a five are equal, with rolling two dice the odds of rolling  twelve are much less. That makes this game a less interesting to me. Rolling dice is more fun anayways and fits this game better. Still well done variant.

Fun though very similar to the dice/original game. Perhaps some more control.

My initial feeling was a bit meh on this one, but armed with slightly better grasp of the rules this turned out to be a fun little game. Similar to Qwixx, but different, and in an interesting way. I like this quite a bit, actually.

Suggest.

First impression (3 players): 
It is a remake I just kind of don't get why it was made. Original already was a very short filler and this one just changed dice into cards (and some rules along) and it isn't all that much different ... 

I happen to like it as a dice game a lot more so my motivation to play this one is rather low, hence low rating.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]I ended up trading this one away because we have card games we like much more and this one wasn't coming off the shelf. It's a fine game, but I would much rather play the dice version if I want a Qwixx fix.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Quick card game that plays great with 2 - 4 players.
- Another version of Qwixx that is simple to teach, with a clean rule set [i](perfect as a gateway game, especially for traditional card players)[/i]. 
- There is no Jone's theory here, both games use the same scoring rules but they both play very differently. 
- While this version retains some of the luck found in the dice version, you can mitigate it with clever play especially once you add in the wild cards.

This is a great translation of the dice game, I am always willing to play either of these games. This version has more depth than the dice version since you are not reliant on die rolls, but it is still a light, gateway game.[/i]

An interesting twist on the climbing scoring mechanic in Qwixx.  Instead of playing the odds of rolling a pair of dice, the focus is now on card drafting and hand management.  There are subtle tactics involved in discarding to open up room in your hand and affecting cards available for other players.  This game has a much different feel from the dice game even though the scoring is the same.  It is a bit slower paced since there is more to consider on a given turn.  Qwixx fans who like it for the dice may not like this one, but fans of traditional style card games should enjoy this.

Didn't really like this one. Qwixx isn't my thing, and having the cards doesn't make it better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I'm puzzled why they call this the 'more strategic' version of Qwixx? In 'normal' Qwixx you know that there is a Gauss-curve when throwing dice, so not making a big jump over the 7, that's what I call a strategic decision. Here cards come at random. I guess you can start with counting cards and memorizing what has been played, but where is the quick fun game in that?

Actually like this better than the dice version. also like that fact that if one player locks out a colour, other players can still play that colour.

Slightly more tactical than it's older brother as well.

Ha! Take a dicey filler, and replace the fast turns (but maybe simple decisions) by some serious hand management requirements and a bit more thinking time.

RATING: 6
I like [thing=131260][/thing]. As a filler it does everything it sets out to do in a short amount of time. This version replaces all dice with cards that you play from your hand (except for the white dice, those cards come from a deck). You would think this makes it more strategic as you get to choose what you play, but refilling your had is a real crapshoot. You know what value you are looking for in what color, but taking a card of that value gives you only 25% of getting the color right. It might turn out to be more strategic indeed (I won by choosing to max one color as much as possible) but I didn't find it as fun. I don't think I'd ever choose this over the original one, so it's quite redundant in my mind.

Initial score: 6/10

I like this better than its die-rolling parent. Qwix the card game gives players some healthy choices and, while there's a large dollop of luck involved, this plays quickly enough that the luck isn't bothersome.

Kartenspiel, Absacker

Die Kartenversion des genialen Qwixx. Hat mich nicht überzeugt. Der Mechanismus passt einfach besser zu Würfeln, mit dem höheren Glückselement und der Zockerei. Wegen dem tollen Bruder hat das Kartenspiel bei mir keine Chance auf den Tisch zu kommen.

Awesome game. Excellent bits and board, very immersive. It is probably my favorite 2-player game, and it is THE definitive Lord of the Rings game. If you want an epic Lord of the Rings gaming experience, this game cannot be beat.

During the game, both players must allocate their actions between the fellowship of the ring (either finding them or getting them to Mordor) and the War between the Free Peoples and the Shadow. Each nation has their own miniatures and the cards do a very good job of reenacting situations (or possible situations) from the books. The action dice are a cool part of the game that can force you to alter your strategy a bit, but still gives you a ton of choices.

The second edition has a less geographically accurate board (the game space relationships are the same, but the actual artwork is less accurate), but is superior in all other respects; looks better, bigger cards, Gollum figure included, updated rules, etc...

Muy buen juego, al que no le pongo un 9 por la complejidad del reglamento y su duración, excesiva creo yo. Tiene unos muy buenos componentes, como son los dados de acción (me encantan), aunque algunos mejorables como las miniaturas. La gestión de dados y, sobre todo, la temática es lo que más puede enganchar a este juego.

Decent game but surprisingly poor components. A whole bunch of cheaply produced and badly sculpted plastic figures that are also awkward to use and hard to distinguish. And the board must be one of the least attractive depictions of middle earth I've seen.

RATING: 8.75
My pleasure with The Battle of Five Armies lead me to greatly desire this game and when I finally got my hands on it, it did not disappoint. While ultimately more complicated than TBoFA, it is also more epic in feel; vaster and greater in scope. The amount of miniatures is astounding and the size of the board is a wow-getter. I greatly prefer the size of the cards in WotR to the cards in TBoFA, because they're so large and satisfying to hold. Really, though, it comes down to the movement of The Fellowship and the decisions that the Free Peoples player has to make in light of the mounting Shadow forces and the disappearing bastions. The game always tells a beautiful story and when you get two experienced players going against each other, you're bound to have an intense and rewarding time.

Compared with the 1st edition the playability has been improved, especially the colouring on the map and the bigger cards. This is definitely a plus but does not justify a different rating. The rule tweaks may be in place, but this is hard to say since I won't be playing the game that much to notice the difference.

Amazing game. Dice&card-based. Work of art really. Known events can be triggered but it never feels scripted. Very long game tough. Still, so immersive and fun that you hardly notice.

Retell the Lord of the Rings story.  It is a rich experience for any fan of LotR and there is plenty of replayability due to the multiple win conditions.  The only drawback is its a hard one to teach as there are a lot of game mechanics to learn and the interaction of cards, dice, board position and other trackers takes several games to get comfortable with.

Okay, opened it last night, inventoried everything, set up the board just to get a feel of everything, and I'm maybe 3/4 through the rule book, and things are starting to click in.  But then it was almost midnight, and my brain just couldn't absorb anything anymore, so I went to the other room, and played "Wrath of Ashardalon" for maybe half an hour before going to bed.

Initial thoughts: feels scripted although it is probably due to the faithful adaptation of the books; beautiful to look at; too many miniatures that look similar and often don't fit on the game board; not seeing the strategic depth, more tactical in nature, especially with the amount of dice, long set up time, fiddly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A very tight design! The designer captures both the Fellowship of the Ring story involving taking the ring to volcano to destroy as well as the battle for Middle Earth and the return of the King and the ascension of Gandalf.  Much of the story (at least as much as I know it) is contained in the game while and you are playing a great game of resource, dice, and card management.  It's a bit long, but so were the books and so were the movies: you simply cannot tell this epic tale in a short setting.

Although a fiddly game and a bear to teach, this game is LOTR in a box. Essentially only playable as a two OR four player game (things get too fiddly with 3) it is a fantastic experience and I've had a number of very different games of it. Unfortunate thing is that as a lot of the game is hidden on cards, it strongly disadvantages new players vs experienced.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I love how immersive the theme is in this game—it's been said that War of the Ring is the LoTR Trilogy in a box, and I can't disagree. Mechanically speaking, I'd love to see a little more depth to the combat system—if I'm rolling d6s to fight, I'd like there to be some interesting modifiers in play to limit the randomness (see: Eclipse ship parts). That's my single gripe; otherwise it's a fantastic game.

And hot damn the Anniversary Edition is gorgeous. It even rivals the elusive Collector's Edition, and in some ways is an even better production. I'm very glad to have a copy in my collection, and the production value easily gives this amazing game a place on my shortlist of 10s.

It is the movie of the Lord of the Rings in a box. The theme comes through strongly and they did not make the mistake of just making it a war game. You can win by corrupting the ring bearer or destroying the ring. 
Downside is the set up and playing time is long, about 3hrs if both people know the rules and it is much more immersive to play with a painted set. 
Other than that, the definitive LOTR game.

RATING: 8.5
Gorgeous looking, epic and extremely thematic is the best way to describe War of the Ring. It's an excellent game, that excites me even during the set up, as I place those humongous armies on the board.

I'm not even that much of a fan, when it comes to thematic games. I even actively dislike them, when they don't support their theme with a solid set of mechanisms. Fortunately, for the most part, this is not the case with War of the Ring. Sure there's luck involved in rolling for your actions, but this action dice system is very well executed. It doesn't happen too often that the dice mess up your strategy. They actually provide an interesting challenge, as you need to adapt to the results and make the best out of them. I think that this system is actually a very clever use of randomness.

What I dislike instead is the core of the combat resolution mechanism. The dice in this case play too big a role in the results. Sure you can play cards to influence the outcome, but I've seen A LOT of battles where the cards became ineffective and a sequence of mediocre dice rolls completely messed up an entire game. It's really a pity that the combat resolution is so random, because War of the Ring could have been one of my favorite games of all time... and, as it is, it simply is not.

Still I like the game quite a bit and I'm actually very impressed by it, because it made me understand how thematic games can be extremely engaging. In fact this is for sure the most thematic game I've ever played and it's basically a must buy for every LotR fan out there. I just wish they would update its combat mechanisms, taking ideas and hits from games like Kemet, Blood Rage or Cry Havoc. Unfortunately, as it is, the game is a missed 10 for me. Still great though! I can't wait to play it again!

RATING: 7
FAVOURITE GAME - It is the quintessential wargame. It is based on Tolkien's Lord of the Rings universe and tries to follow the storyline of the book. You are in charge either of Sauron's forces or the free people (basically everyone else). In turn you recruit, move armies, engage in battles. You have the possibility to summon powerful allies known from the book. Either side must gather a number of victory points by conquering cities and strongholds. There is also an adventure game element. The free people are in control of the Fellowship, which moves secretly towards Mount Doom, if they reach it, the good guys wins. It is a rules heavy, but very in-depth strategy game, which test you distributive attention, as there are a lot of units to watch for. After you are quite familiarized with the rules the gameplay flows very neatly. It is by far one of the most epic games ever.

Para mim este é o melhor jogo já publicado em termos de adaptação, ambientação e imersão. A parida é uma verdadeira imersão no universo dos livros e sonho com o dia em que eles lancem algo para o Silmarillion (assim como fizeram com o Hobitt - Batalha dos 5 Exércitos).

O jogo tem mecânicas até simples, porém são dezenas de detalhes, fases e para quem nunca jogou, recomendo fortemente a leitura do manual duas vezes, assistir reviews, gameplays e explicação de regras, além de ter ajuda aos jogadores a mão o tempo todo.

Um jogo que todo fã de Senhor dos Anéis merece e precisa ter na coleção. Se não tiver, merece pelo menos passar pela experiência de jogar ele.

Com a expansão você acrescenta o fator "e se", mas isso fica para um comentário quando eu adquirir a mesma.

A versão nacional da Devir tem uma série de pormenores, mas não tira o brilho deste lançamento.

Very good game, but very very long, so the game don't go to the table very often, but the feel of the middle earth is splendit and the miniatures are good, Ares is a very good company, I liked the tarot card sizes. The big problems is that the dices limit your actions a lot.

I've enjoyed this two player and with a group. I think this and Caylus were the beginning of my turning into a primarily Ameritrash and wargame player. The first time I played I did not like it at all...now I would rather play it than most other games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Excellent game.  As of 20170409, I've played this eight times, with six wins for FP. It's nearly always a tense game. I think it's actually harder for the Shadow to win than FP, despite Shadow's much more powerful army.

Cons: 
1. Takes a few hours to play.
2. The miniatures look too alike and are difficult to distinguish.
3. A player who knows the cards has a distinct advantage over a player who doesn't know what to expect from the cards.
4. One of the detractors of this game likened this game to flipping a coin to determine the winner.  This is a reasonable criticism, since so much dice rolling and random tile drawing is used.  In one of my games, the victor was going to depend solely on the drawing of a single hunt tile.  I still loved that particular game, but it seemed to be an unfortunate way to end a game that took so long to play.
5. Other detractors said that this game is Risk with a layer of chrome on it.  This is partially reasonable, due to the dice rolling in combat, and moving soldiers in regions on a map.  However, the game has so much more to it than Risk.  I hate Risk and I like this game.
6. This game seems like it would take a few sessions of practice to really get the hang of it.

Pros:
1. It's an intense experience.
2. Long term strategy needs to be used.  It takes shape as the game goes along.  Seeing your opponent use strategies to confound your own makes things tense.
3. The game creates memorable moments.  With other games, I typically remember nothing and don't care.  With this game, I remember particular events that caused cheering or consternation.
4. The theme is superb, and it's easy to immerse oneself in the story.
5. Due to the theme, this game is a combination of an interactive story and a wargame.
6. The players can become emotionally invested in their characters and armies.  I believe this happens due to the amount of time it takes to see one's plans come to fruition.  This is another thing that adds to the intensity of the experience.
7. I find myself looking at the map and planning new strategies for my future games.
8. Even though there are only two victory conditions for each side, the way to achieve those conditions can take shape in many different ways.
9. The artwork is gorgeous.
10. Being a fan of Lord of the Rings definitely would make this game more enjoyable, but you don't need to be a fan of Lord of the Rings to enjoy it.

So far, I've seen:
Shadow: 2 military victories
Free Peoples: 1 military victory
Free Peoples: 5 ring victories

Epic. If you want Lord of the Rings in a box then this is it. Takes us on average six hours (at least five) to play, but never dull or tedious and very rewarding.  Always a great finish and we still want more. It would score even higher if not for the play time required. The rulebook does not make learning it easy, but it's worth the effort.

Rated after four plays.

The game is absolutely great, both as game play and the quality of components. The miniatures are fantastic, the only thing to complain about is the design of the map.

EDIT: My rating changed from 9.25 to 9.75. After several plays we still got a few rules wrong but not enough to change the outcome of the game. I find War of the Ring to be the third best game I played lately and I will play it again many time. The strategy is different from game to game, the balancing in amazing and there's a thrill from beginning to the end.

EDIT: The game feels amazing after several plays and it's should be a straight 10 if not for the poor map graphics. We're thinking to modify and print our own map to make the gaming experience truly exceptional. There's tension in every game and it's always on the edge, with the "if I only rolled a 6..." being the last phrase. My best game of 2013 without doubt.

EDIT: after one more play I am changing the rating to a clean 10. The balance, the diversity of choices and the perfect mix of theme and game play makes War of the Ring one of the best games I ever played

Unique of his genre. It would be a 10 if it wasn't for the dice factor. I mean, Sauron player is very strong and if the the free people are unlucky with dice scores thing are really going to be bad for them. Also, the mechanics of the hunt are not very easy to use for sauron player, after a lot of playing I'm still not confident with them.

RATING: 7
It took me a long time to track down this game since it was out of stock in all the shops here in Canada. I finally got it and it wasn't quite what I expected...the setup was brutal and we had to stop a ton of times for rules clarification (the rule book could be more organized), but once we got going the game ran very smoothly and definitely had a good lord of the rings vibe to it.  I'm still happy I bought it because it's a game that is best with 2 players and that's usually the number of players I get to play with. The Shadow plays a lot more straightforward...but the free folk need to be a bit more careful of what they do and when. I feel like maybe Star Wars: Rebellion would kind of replace this game on my shelf if I got it since they seem very similar in mechanics. 

Cons:
The game takes a VERY long time to set up compared to other games.
The game is rule heavy.
The tarot cards are basically 2 cards in 1 with no graphics and just a wall of text with complicated effects that you need to really understand in order to be successful. 
The dice rolls force you into a particular path to victory that may not be what you wanted to do.
Almost every figure in the game is blue or red. This makes things very confusing as Rohan and Gondor and the north men and so on are all pretty similar yet come into play at different times based on whatever is happening with the political track. 
It's expensive (high end of the gaming spectrum, not counting ccgs and miniature games which are in a league of their own)

Pros: 
There are a ton of cool figures which are decent quality.
The game feels epic.
It seems pretty balanced (though it is asymmetrical)
The production quality of the game is good.
The rules do work well and the game is pretty smooth to play once you've learned them. 
If you were ever going to flip a table, this would be a great game to do it on.

Played this game for the first time and immediately loved it. The way multitude of events can play out is incredible. In the first game, the Shadow army obliterated Rohan and Gondor and then caught themselves unaware of a mustered Dwarf and Elf army marching to Moria and Dol Guldur. The fall of Moria to the Free Peoples kept them in the fight. The final determining turn was whether The Free Peoples and the Shadow could capture a stronghold to secure victory. The Shadow ended up finally conquering the last Gondorian stronghold before The Dwarf/Elf army could retake Mirkwood. This was just a little example of a possible outcome. I highly recommend it, despite it's heavy mechanics.

One of my favorite games and maybe the best heavy two player war game available.

The theme will be very appealing to most and it is well expressed through every aspect of the game.  If you know the books then it's a lot of fun to see the story unfold with slight variations.  All the characters and armies are there and they work just like they should.

It also works well for me because I don't feel like it's as ultra-complex as lots of the other two player war games I've tried.  Just it's still complex, but it's also streamlined.

The best idea that this game captures from the book is that the war is fought on two fronts.  You have the armies clashing trying to take control of important cities, but you also have ring mission trying to sneak in and win the game.  

The game requires you to pay attention to both fronts and figure out how to divide up your resources because neglecting either one will give your opponent the win.

I would like to rate this beautiful and epic game higher, but it takes sooo long to set up and play.

This is a HEAVY game. Individually, the systems in it aren't really too complex there's just a ton of them with varying degrees of how they function. The other player and myself had a really hard time wrapping our heads around the functional differences between fortresses, cities and strongholds for a long time and after finishing the game I think we were still doing it wrong.

I want to play this at least two times with someone who knows the rules before I would feel comfortable rating it.

The ultimate Middle Earth wargame, but like many focused wargames, it carries the limitation that players will have to want to be involved in this specific event. However, it does not have to go according to plan (as per the books), and that level of variation within the War is what will keep players invested. I do not exactly have someone interested in war gaming within this universe, and it's more likely that they'd be into something like one of my LOTR card games. Rules work well, but I found them slightly counter intuitive to learn. Solid action dice mechanics, sensible combat, interesting asymmetrical play, and definitely feels like an in depth Risk-like for gamers' gamers. Components and artwork are great, really embracing the spirit of the novels instead of modern flair; though some of my figures came warped.

Utterly brilliant. Breathtaking scope, meaningful choices, sprawling game map, and a tense battle between two fronts. 

The most complete, epic, sweeping, panoramic game based on a theme of its time. This is Hall of Fame stuff.

Only drawback is the long playing time. Not for quick or casual.

Kicsit gondban voltam a pontozásnál, mert a régi kiadásra 7-est adtam anno (5 éve), erre viszont legalább 9-est szerettem volna adni (majd részletezem, miért), holott a két játék szinte tök ugyanaz:) Ezt úgy hidaltam át, hogy a régit is felpontoztam 8-ra, így csak 1 pont a difi.

Miért is ez a különbség az értékelésben? Nagyrészt ez az eltelt 5 évvel magyarázható, és nem az apróbb javításokkal. A két játék közt nincs nagy eltérés, a különbség inkább magamban keresendő. Ma valószínűleg az 1. kiadásra is 9-est adnék. Mert míg 5 éve hetekig szöszmötöltem a szabállyal, magamnak barkácsoltam a kártyafordítást, saját szabálykivonatot gyártottam, addig most a régi kivonatot is tudtam használni, valamennyire emlékeztem is a játékra, és sokkal szebb magyar kártyák álltak rendelkezésemre. Kevésbé volt macera a rákészülés. Emellett az eltelt időben sok száz játékot kipróbáltam, wargame-eket is, tematikusabbakat is, és kicsit az ízlésem is megváltozott. Ma valahogy nagyobbat üt nálam egy ilyen tematikus játék. Mert mondjuk ki, ez az egyik legjobb a tematikusak közül(függetlenül attól, hogy melyik kiadás), legfeljebb néhány játék vetekszik ezzel (pl. BSG?!).
De azért a két kiadás közt mégis van néhány különbség. Pl. az első szabályában nem voltak benne a kockadobások eredményei, ami nonszensz, a díszdobozos szabályából kellett levadászni anno. Itt precízen szerepel minden, és az is kiderül, hogy a szabad népek kockaeloszlása nem véletlen tér el az árnyakétól. A kártyák szebbek lettek, apróbb balanszolásokat is végeztek rajtuk (legfontosabb talán a csatakártyák kijátszási sorrendjének változása), és most már van műanyag Gollum is:) Ami viszont csalódás, hogy az újban a bábuk más műanyagból készültek, bár lehet hogy ez nem kiadásfüggő, hanem random:)

A játék legfőbb erőssége a hangulata, és az, hogy a szokásos wargame elemek (erőd, ostrom, nyílt csata, visszavonulás, toborzás stb.) mellett nagyon jól sikerült beilleszteni a Gyűrűhordozók utáni hajszát a játékba, ami teljesen egyedivé teszi.

Amikor felálltunk a mai játéktól, rengeteg ötletem lett volna, hogy állnék neki legközelebb, melyik erődöket lehetne legkönnyebben megszerezni, hogy lenne hatékonyan a Gyűrűt vinni, melyik hősöket mikor, hova lenne érdemes játékba hozni és küldeni. Szerintem nagyon sok játék van benne!!! A kieg még dobhat rajta, bár az így is nagyon hosszú játékmenet még több lehet. A mi partink egyébként nagyon drámaian alakult: A Gonosz már 8-0-ra vezetett, látszólag eldőlt a meccs, de váratlanul a Szabad népek fordítottak 4-5-re, egy hajszálon múlt, hogy nem nyerték meg végül, sajnos a forduló végéig nem sikerült tartani az erődöket, de órákkal meghosszabbították a reménytelennek tűnő küzdelmet. Végül 6-3-nál feladta a szabad nép, mert egyértelművé vált a vereség (így is 5+ órás parti volt). Annak idején volt egy csúfos pár órás vereségem az 1. kiadással a szabad népekkel, akkor azt állapítottuk meg, hogy könnyebb az árnyakkal játszani. Nos igen, az árnyaknak sok kockájuk van, az egységeik végtelen számúak, a szabad népek egységei előbb-utóbb elfogynak (meglepően hamar), de egyrészt ott van a Gyűrűhordozó, mint esély, másrészt a 4 pont hódítás egyáltalán nem tűnik elérhetetlennek. És gondolom a kártyákkal igyekeztek kiegyenlíteni a nagy erőkülönbséget. Apropó kártyák: nagyon sokat számít a kártyaismeret a játékban. 10-20 parti után irtó nagy előnyben lehet valaki egy kezdővel szemben (kb. mint 1960-nál, vagy TS-nél).

Összefoglalva: nagyon nagy élmény volt, pedig ki se volt festve!!! Az enyém festés alatt áll, ezért nem a sajátommal játszottunk. Festve még ütősebb lesz szerintem:)
---
Na kész a festés másfél év után:) El sem akarom hinni, annyi ideig tartott... Kipróbáltuk így is, és simán megy feljebb a pontszám, vagyis most látom, hogy valamikor már átírtam 9-re, de még a 10-esen is gondolkodom. Szinte tökéletes a játék számomra, és a kiegjét még nem is próbáltam. Vagyis Fehér Gandalf és Aragorn bábuját betettük a kiegből tokenek helyett, sokkal jobb volt így:)
Bűn kiadni festés nélkül, nekem tök sokat számít játék közben is, meg pakolásnál is a színe. Toborzásnál pl. azonnal látszik, melyik egység hova kerülhet...

There are a great many Lord of the Rings themed games on the market right now and I think it is safe to say that this is easily one of the best out there.  The theme of the game is incredible and when I explain this to people, I often call it "Lord of the Rings" in a box.  When first looking at this game, there are a few things which stand out to people and the first and foremost is "look!  It's Lord of the Rings Risk!"  That can not be farther from the truth.  While the initial reaction may be that statement, you soon realize with all of the decisions that it is far from just Lord of the Rings Risk.  

Whether it comes from the decisions of the Fellowship of the Ring, or from a military victory, the free peoples can end this game fairly quickly if they play their cards right.  But the overwhelming decisions of what to do first can make it quite difficult for the free peoples to win the game.

The easiest way for the shadow to win the game is through a military victory, though it is quite lengthy.  The reason I say this is the easiest way is due to the decisions made by the free peoples.  If you go into the game looking to corrupt the ring bearer, the entire game is based on waiting for the Free peoples to move the Fellowship.  It seems as though they can control the timing of the game, which is one of the genius mechanics of the game.  The shadow has the obvious advantage in the military victory, but the Free peoples can control the length of the game.

All in all, this game is one of the best I have played in my collection.  Every time it comes out on the table, there is a different game which is being played.  While I have not yet played with the expansion, I am looking forward to it in our following plays.  

If you are looking for the perfect Lord of the Rings game, look not further.

Probably the best thematic game that has ever been made. It is certainly the best that uses the LOTR theme. It plays like a cross between Axis and Allies and a Card Driven Wargame like "We The People." I love how the game feels true to the storyline of the books, but allows you to explore alternate "what if" scenarios that feel like they could have happened. The main issues that keep me from rating it higher are the game's length and complexity. It isn't the easiest game to learn so if you don't have a consistent opponent to play with it can be difficult to get it on the table.

Technically a better game than the original and the CE.  It cleaned up the rules and the board and made for a more balanced game.  It's also got better expansions coming out for it that will make it even better.

Once the complete special edition for it comes out I feel like it will make the original CE obsolete.

I sold my first edition copy to get this one. I like the new map and the rule changes which seems to have balanced the base game. The 1st edition is still a great game, but skilled players will eventually find it is unbalanced and will need to add the expansion. 1st edition with expansion is a solid 10, I would never turn a game down! This new edition looks nicer, has Nazgul that don't topple over, and looks to be made even more interesting with future expansions from Ares.

Wow, just wow. I knew this was going to be good, but had no idea of the incredible amount of theme that is just pouring out of this box. I love anything (pretty much) LOTR related, but this game just takes it to a whole other level of awesome. It is the Lord of the Rings books in a box. There are sooooooo many thing going on here, but it just flows together so well. The combat mechanism is smooth, but gives many great choices. The Hunt for the Ring mini-game is a very tense blast. In our game, the Shadow player pulled it out when the Ring Bearers got to 12 Corruption moving to the 4th step of the Mordor track. Very close. I will add the Lords of Middle Earth expansion next game as I think maybe the Shadow has a slight advantage. We shall see.

Fantastic themed game. Very minor criticism is that it i believe it gives the illusion of a multitude of choices and different options but after many plays I think the options just add flavour (albeit very thematic) to the same end game every time, coming down to somewhat random Tile draws.

Great themed game. You really feel like you're in Tolkien's story.
But the setup is super long, the game is super long, there are quite many rules and exceptions and as the free people's player, you might have the feeling that you are loosing during the whole game because you will mostly be conquered anyway... This feels a bit bad...

After one game I strongly feel that this is a game that, like Twilight Struggle, will benefit heavily from players knowing the cards. So it will probably get better with each play. Unfortunately it is very long and I'm not in a position to get i a lot of plays of this. It also competes for playtime with games like Twilight Struggle and 1989 which I love. Maybe a once-a-year game for me.

Whoa... This is the trilogy in a box.  This is a big asymetrical battle between the free people of middle earth, and the forces of Sauron.  The game isn't perfect, and has a ton of little "finicky" rules, but they make up one of the coolest 2 player experiences out there.  It has a little bit of the CDG element, to go along with what felt like a really neat combat system.  A game I don't know if I need to own, just because it is so hard to play, but this is something I am definitely interested to play more.

I stayed away from this game for three years because I was so scared off by hearing how difficult it was to learn how to play and how long the sessions lasted. That was a mistake.

You already know that this is a triumph of thematic gaming. What I find so engrossing is the tension between the two different victory conditions held between the two asymmetric sides. It's a war game with another level of mechanical consciousness and that consciousness if flavored by the richness of Tolkien's trilogy. It's a masterpiece.

I have to say (or write) that this is one of the most enjoyable games I have ever played. In the last three
 months it has been played continuously and avidly by my game group, leaving it up inbetween sessons and immediatly restarted with new players when a game resolves. The game has fantastic mini's, a challenging and engrossing mechanic, and WONDERFUL art.
If I didn't have a life, I would buy the collectors edition.

 For those of you that are new to the game or are befuddled by the rules, this has proven the most helpful reference I've found for a quick walkthrough on how to play...

One hell of a learning curve on this one..47 page rulebook and tons of complexity. Took me almost eight hours to finish my first run through! The video tutorials from  http://www.warofthering.eu/videotutorials.html are a must! A great game, but not a game you are likely to finish in one session (unless all players have learned it and know it well.) This may affect it's re-playability, but I, for one, will always hold onto this as well as the hope that one of my buddies gets into it.

Of course, very similar to the first edition. I've only played each once, but on this play the nature of the cards reminded me a bit of Twilight Struggle- in that the more you play the game and get to know the cards, the more strategy paths become apparent (and of course a big advantage in knowing what kind of weird moves are possible with cards). Quite enjoyable, but like the first edition, it does feel like it takes too long for what it is.

Hands down my favourite game, despite being unable to play it as often as I'd like. There aren't enough superlatives to describe how much I love every aspect of this game. Doesn't hit the table enough due to the time required to play it, and the commitment it takes to learn the rules.

It really is a great game and I love asymmetry that balances well between the war and the ring.

RATING: 9
Amazing game. If you've read the books, you will marvel at how much thought and detail went into the design to keep the game totally thematic—in the pacing, in the layout of the map, in the timing of the cards and the activation of the armies. It's almost as if the game presses you to make decisions that recreate Tolkien's original narrative, while still remaining uncertain of the outcome. 

Take the map: Mirkwood, as we all know, is hard to get through (3 spaces), but if you use the Old Forest Road, it's easier (1 space). The mountains by Rivendell are impossible to pass, so you'll probably want to go through Moria if you're heading Southeast. 

Like the books, you'll find yourself killing off Gandalf the Grey so that Gandalf the White will appear later. Sauron can continually generate orcs, so has an unlimited supply for recruitment (unlike the Free People who are removed from the game forever when killed). Some nations are hesitant to enter the war and need lots of convincing—sound familiar? So many thematic touches make this heaven for a LOTR fan.

Extremely thematic- feels like the Lord of the Rings in a box. Lovely minis. Great map. Great card system (very cool decisions required). I actually like the 2v2 team variant better than the 1v1. I love the fact that you can win via military victory or via the fellowship of the ring route. 

I didn't like one thing in particular, and it is extremely prevalent, hence the lower rating: 
- It is way too luck dependent for my tastes (the hunt for the ring chit pulls, the dice rolling combat system)

This simple wargame captures the tension between Sauron's  desperate seach for the Ring across Middle Earth, and the excruciating horror of the Fellowship's trek to Mount Doom.

The nice green map and Tarot-sized cards fix what was wrong with the first edition.

Unfortunately the fine balance of the first edition seems gone, and it is now pro-Fellowship between two casual players.  I get the sense the rules were changed to move the balance back to the Fellowship due to some Shadow cheese moves common in tournament play, but for casual players, it just seems too hard now for the Shadow.

I'm a big fan of dudes on a map games, but at the same time, I'm not a big Tolkein fan. So, after one play, I like the asymmetry and the different victory conditions of this game, but much of the effort to have the theme shine through with different rules and factions is lost on me with my utter unfamiliarity of the story.

I'd play it again but not clamoring to do so.

Production quality for this game gets an absolute A++.  It literally is LotR in a box.  That being said, I'm not quite sure where all the love for this title comes from.  Played a few times and wasn't particularly engaged  The random dice betray you at every turn and the horrific RISK-esque combat system will decimate an attacking army in seconds (even with overwhelming numerical superiority).  Just try to evict someone from a fortress that they can flee into at the drop of a hat.  Strategy be damned, I've made more progress toward winning the game just sitting back and letting the Corruption track increase while the Fellowship is already in Mordor.  Obviously plenty of people out there love it, and to each his own, but it just wasn't for me.

Surprisingly enough what with the word "war" in its title and all, this is not a wargame.

Has a great feeling to it and beautiful artwork.

RATING: 10
Played a bunch with my old first edition set too. 

Amazing transposing of the LotR books into a light wargame. There are lots of little things to remember and weird fellowship mechanics, but after a handful of plays, it all becomes second nature. 

Knowing your event deck is key to becoming a good player. I don't and haven't. 

Really fun to attempt weird, novel moves based on your current hand and board position. Inventing a top-notch euro (TtA or Tigris, for example) is an accomplishment, but taking the LotR books and transforming them into a malleable boardgame of this complexity (while keeping true to the spirit of the series) is a real achievement. 

September 2017 - finally played with LoME and WoME. These definitely make for a more immersive experience and let the player manage the details that are abstracted in the base game. And the directions the game can take are numerous now. I like the LoME mechanics. Not as keen on the WoME mechanics - they aren't clunky, but I find them a bit annoying. Probably just need to get used to them.

However, you definitely lose some elegance/simplicity and gain playing time when adding the expansions. I already prefer using the expansions, but it will be tougher to "get to the table" when adding WoME. 

December 2017 - 
Finally got off ass and ordered replacement combat dice.

Chessex Scarab line:
 
   Royal Blue w/ Gold Pips for FP.
   Scarlet w/ Gold Pips for SP. 

JUST CAN'T EVEN with those stock 12mm(?) dice and their ridiculous "1" and "2" configurations. 

Next up is painting the figures' base edges to help differentiate between nations more easily. 

... and when I'm feeling extra sad and pathetic I'll pick up a proper (non-movie) LOTR mug or something for the hunt pool. Mini rice-steamer ain't cutting it.

Epic area control game just dripping in theme. On the first play it didn't disappoint and I consider it one of the best games I have played. 

On the first play the free peoples (played be me) just won through a military victory. The game was extremely close and it could have gone either way (coming down to two key battles at the end). Unfortunately for the shadow players they couldn't take the Eleven strongholds for victory at the end. 

While the ring bearers didn't complete their quest in the first play through it was such an integral part of the game. It forces both sides to balance their actions between progressing the ring bearers quest (or stopping it) and maneuvering armies on the board. The ring bearers essentially keep constant competitive pressure on both sides and acts in many ways as the timer in the game. 

Having played Conan before this, I can now understand why many say it is pale imitation of War of the Ring. Having now played both, this observation is justified. War of the Ring is simply a great game. 

9/8/14 - Played a second time as the free peoples and lost to the shadow military victory. In retrospect and upon review of the rules I made some errors which I will need to be aware of next time. The main one being it is legal for a force in the field around a stronghold to retreat to an adjacent region rather than the stronghold (I must have misread the rules, as the condition is 'may' rather than 'must' and the normal adjacent region rules still apply). This could have changed things. The other rule issue was that once a force retreats into a siege, that battle is over and the attacking army must recommence the siege next turn, and they only get to attack ONCE per turn against a stronghold. Regardless of these issues the outcome most likely would have been the same as I didn't play the fellowship well, it would have just would have drawn the game out longer, although if I had managed to retreat my characters I would have kept more dice for longer. Still loved playing and this is a great game.

It is true, this is Lord of the Rings in a box! As a lover of the books (and the extended version of the films), I love playing this one. I need to get better at it and I hope some of the alternate win/loss conditions happen a little more frequently with more plays. The narrative is great, the mechanics are really fun, especially the dice action and multi-use cards for battle/actions. So much to love and I can't wait to open up some of the strategic options with the expansions. This is also just about the WORST game to setup...really hoping for the Meeple Realty insert.

RATING: 9
An epic game that lets you create your own version of the story. Does a great job of generating thematic mood: As the Free People's player the path to victory appears daunting but somehow an opportunity opens up and you manage to slip through; As the Shadow you feel like you can sweep the board but then something goes wrong, you miss a detail or over extend yourself and somehow you are vulnerable. Outcomes of dice rolls can be punishing but you can mitigate this to some extent through board position and card play.

Nice asymmetric game. A little hard to get all the rules and exceptions right the first few times through but despite this, still good fun. Despite being more complicated than our usual games my wife is a fan and enjoys playing as Sauron. My only complaint relates to the colours (or lack of colours) of the army pieces. Given that what nation a piece belongs to is important, it would be much better to have made the units in different colours depending on their nation - chances are this would speed up our set up time massively.

Theme is great, when I am playing this game, I feel tons of anxiety about Frodo.

Another satisfying moment is when you catch bad guys unaware and kill Saruman, things can happen.

This game is incredibly thematic,but once you get over your Tolkienism,you realize that this is a sometimes unnecessary complex game that tries to fit theme and rules together,making for some gameplay chores that don't feel fun.Furthermore,if you are a complete first timer in this game,you'll have no clue on what or how to play the first time you play it,nor the second and the third.

Personally I never got into it,but if you have the will and motives to try and love this game,I'm sure in the end you'll get rewarded.

Certainly needs you to watch some video playthroughs before playing for the first time or else you'll be completely lost in my opinion

Well after 30 plays of the 2nd edition (and some 200+ of the 1st edition), sadly I think I'm done with WotR as instead of a 1.5-2.5 hr game, it is now a marathon 4+ hr game, especially when I'm the free.  I'd much rather play 6 games of Memoir.  The 2nd ed. and expansions are just a money grab imho with no regards to making the game better.  Oh well, we had fun while it lasted.  Next..

This is quite an amazing game. Asymetric sides, dripping with theme, multiple ways to win, combat as well as hidden Fellowship. The designers have captured most of the characters, events, and locations from the books and incorporated it into the game. Excellent concept and true to the story or the story's potential. It's great to play each side, as they play so differently from each other. I love the tension involved with the various aspects of the game, such as when to separate companions from the fellowship, when to use cards as an event or for combat advantages, and when and where to initiate an assault on the enemy cities/strongholds. Epic wargame level that takes a few games into it to become familiar with the rules and gameplay. Absolutely the best thematic game I've ever played.  

I would prefer wooden discs as units over the plastic figures, for playability.  There's a file created by a user here who made an excellent set of stickers for wooden discs.  Someday...

(2nd Edition Comments) Better board, slight tweaks to rules and characters, bigger cards, better Nazgul sculpts, and cleaner rules.

RATING: 7
Pros:
An epic experience with action selection through dice. Timing card play and board positioning while trying to read what your opponent may attempt for is a great back and forth experience.

Cons:
Long setup and steep learning curve makes it hard to get moving. Best played with dedicated players.

After three plays, I am very impressed by the balance and how close it has been. Each side plays so differently that it makes the replayability high, especially with the cards. Granted there is a lot of luck with the dice, but I think it balances out well with everything else. A terrific game.

RATING: 8.5
Fun, thematic and different enough from other games to earn a solid rating.  Setup takes a bit and the figures will need to be painted (or at least their bases) to tell the different armies apart.  1st edition map is hard to find the settlements and the colors on the map are difficult to discern, these issues are fixed with the 2nd edition.  1st edition does have the kick ass nazgul figures though.  Took about an hour to read the rules and the game is simple enough once you get started.  It took us about 5 hours to get through our first game, it will probably take 3.5 from now on.  Shadow player needs to be aggressive early and go for the military victory, or dedicate lots of eyes to hunt the companions.  Free people player needs to move that ring as fast as possible, a minimum of 1 space per turn and more if there are less than 2 eye dice.  Cards play a big role in the early game, a few bad hands can make the game difficult, but not impossible to win.

Excellent Middle Earth game with a focus on the military side of things. I really like the way the fellowship quest works in conjunction with the rest of the game. It does a neat job capturing the idea that you can't do everything you want to do. A bit difficult to learn, but there's plenty of depth and replay value.

The second edition is an improvement on the first one, especially the cards that are actually readable now. The map is somewhat clearer as well. Apart from that it's the same game.

Update: The fine-tuning they did with the rules really improved the game. Playing it without the expansion is very pleasant and leads to a quicker and dare I say better game.

The presentation of the AE is really fantastic, a job well done. Only complaint is that it's not possible to fit the sleeved cards in the box (and who would play this without sleeves?). I had my old tin box left from 1st edition luckily so they went in there, and you can then stash the counters in the card space.

Perfected what few flaws the game had.  Bigger cards, smaller Nazgul.  And a nicer board with VP tracking + Army boxes.   They also nerfed a strong strategy by changing initial placement a bit.  I'd been clamoring for this awhile so I was especially glad to see it get put in.

They also put in timings on the cards and clarified wording.

All great stuff.  If you were on the fence before, you should be clearly in the "buy it camp" now.

Still going strong years after I rated it a 10.  I played the Anniversary edition recently.  Wow!  It's a beautiful, but big game.  It's hard for me to recognize some of the pieces since they are painted, but great for anyone who hasn't played the game much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Lovely looking game themed on the War of the Ring.  Players represent the Fellowship against the Shadow Alliance.  This breaks down into Elves, North, Dwarves, Gondor and Rohan up against Isengard, Mordor and Haradrim/Easterlings.  Dice are tossed that generate actions, akin to being dealt a hand of cards in a card driven wargame.  Actions are spent on recruiting, campaigning, playing events or on the ring game.  The ring game is an abstracted journey from Rivendell to Sauron's Smithy, with Sauron dogging the footsteps and tossing corruption at the Fellowship.  Sauron is trying to recover the ring or win a military victory before the ring is destroyed.  The gameplay is superb.  The designers obviously understand the book, as all the pressures of force and time are here, and it's been superbly developed into a balanced, thematic game.  This game is a must for Tolkien fans, and worth a try for anyone else.  Great effort.

Long set up and play time, but the game is worth it.  Game play tells such great stories, especially with the added expansion, and replay value is surprisingly great.  Wish the board and pieces were smaller so it didn't take up so much space and I wish the pieces were different colors and easier to distinguish.  I painted the bases making that a little easier, but still would have liked a better color design.

Thematically a very good game. A wargame with a twist. Really nice board and cards and the figures are great, although there are some problems with separating the blue factions (elves, dwarves and humans)and some (but less) problems with separating the red factions (Mordor, Icengaard and Harad). Could have been different colors or variants of blue/red. Negative: It's really leangthy- I've finished it in 7 hours...

Good game. A little long(will play faster with replays of people who have played). Really thematic, lot of flavor. Quite the rulebook to digest. But once done it should be down pretty well. Expansions seem to add more to the fun(although do not have.... yet). This is more strategic and more going on than say just playing risk. So if risk is what you are looking for just play Lord of the Rings Risk it is fun.

RATING: 8
Having cleared up a rules issue this game has become a lot more competitive. I still consider it a little bloated for what it is, but it brings the epic to the table.
---------------------
This game took me a good eight plays to really get. My first 7 plays were all shadow wins, but the 7th was very close.

I don't think this is as tight a design as many CDGs or block war games and strategically if offers something similar. 

However this game does capture LotR on so many levels. It captures the epic of the war and the character struggles. Its a little over complex for what it is, and the onus is on the freepeoples player to strike for the win before the shadow engulfs him.

Also given the quality of production this is really good value for money.

In summary, most of the block and CDG games i've played are better war games that do more with less. But this game really does LoTR stories properly.

Despite its age, this game remains entirely playable and gives you the 'feel' of the LOTR trilogy.  It is always a wonderful spectacle with all the miniatures and oversized tarot cards (which are multifunctional, which I absolutely love).  Given that all actions are determined by chucking some dice around, the game will never play the same, even if it follows a similar direction.  It's good, tense fun.  Beware of them sneaksy free peoples, though.

RATING: 6
In my comments for AGot I said it felt like Risk, however I feel this game feels more like Risk than AGoT does.  Thankfully, it has a lot more going on in it than Risk which makes it so much better.  Some of these mechanics include: cards having combat effects and board effects, managing the fellowship, the hunt for the ring, the political track, and siege combat.  Overall, good, but a bear to setup. Also, I have a natural dislike of games that include unpainted miniatures instead of tokens/meeples. For a long 2-player game, I would rather Twilight Struggle. I haven't played it yet, but Through the Ages would also likely be a better 2-player long game for me. Those who like Ameritrash will probably love this. The second edition is better than the first.

As a thematic rendering of the trilogy in a boardgame, the game is astounding. There were some nice moments such as Gandalf evicting Wormtongue, Gandalf the Grey dying but coming back as the White, and the Fellowship being tempted to take the quicker but more dangerous passage. As a strategy game, it’s far closer to Risk for my tastes.

Between the event cards which pretty much guide what you do/don't do (Didn’t draw the Ents attack Saruman card early on, eh? Forget that idea), the random hunt tile draws, and the dice which limit/guide your actions, you really play a tactical game of flying by the seat of your pants. You can't impose a strategy so much as try to make the most of what the game gives you from one turn to the next. It's all dressed up as an epic strategy game but plays out far too tactically to inspire postgame consideration.

Muy bueno, muy bueno.
Le quito el 0,5 porque todavía he jugado poco, y me parece que es relativamente fácil para los Libres llegar a Mordor y tirar el anillo. No obstante, puede que cuando juegue más y lleve mejor la Sombra, a lo mejor le clavo un 10. De momento, las pocas partidas que llevo me parece que, de una manera brillante, transforma en mecanica de juego todos los pormenores del libro, mediante reglas sencillas que parecen, en un principio, liosas pero que una vez jugadas dos partidas ya no lo son.
Cada partida es un reto, y ambos bandos tienen sus puntos fuertes y débiles. Las cartas le proporcionan el random necesario para que ninguna se repita.
Un "must have" para los amantes de la literatura tolkeniana, a ver para cuando un silmarillion...

Pd.- Efectivamente, después de jugar algunas partidas más le clavo un diez como una casa!... un gran juego, si señor.

Probably one of the heaviest 1v1 strategy war games you could buy, requiring a lot of effort from both players to get the most out of it.  However, those that do will find it to be extremely rewarding as this game provides an epic experience that truly mimics the LotR saga.  The Free Peoples will feel outgunned and scared while they try to sneak the ring closer and closer to Mt. Doom.  The Shadow will feel numerous and strong, but also very worried about the ring bearer and will try very hard to stop and corrupt him.  Very thematic!

It should be noted that the publisher should be shot for not color-coding the miniatures and doing nothing to help the players easily track the units on the board and in the box.  However, if you can get passed that, you should.

This is a great thematic game, it does make you feel like in the Middle Earth with all the components, all the cards, and the details that relate to the books and movies. However, as a strategy game, it is not as great. In my experience playing it, the Free People don't stand a chance against the Shadow Armies, so they must rely on destroying the ring. If they will succeed or not seems to me mostly a matter of luck. Also, this is a 2 player game. 3 or 4 players playing it doesn't feel right.

RATING: 8
War of The Ring is just the right kind of wargame.  It is dripping with Tolkien theme.  The combat system is dice and battle-card heavy, but interesting and wholly appropriate.  The strategies for victory are many.  While you can't avoid some AP in this game (there are so many choices!) and the unpainted colour scheme of the pieces makes things a little confusing, WotR captures the spirit of Tolkien's world accurately and tastefully so. It is the perfect balance of dice battles and card play with thematic connections throughout. There are quite a few heavy systems working together on this one, which can also bog down the game - but it's as full an experience as you're going to get when it comes to a hundred plastic pieces on a board moving around and battling for who reigns supreme!

This game is simply amazing. It is incredible the amount of thought and love that went into the development of this game. The theme is embeded in every detail. The components are top notch: the art, graphic design, the board, the dice, the cards, the miniatures. It is so entertaining that when playing the hours go by without you even noticing it. You must invest time learning the rules but it pays off tenfold in the end. I am enamoured and enfatuated with this game. I painted every single miniature of it and its expansions which makes it that more special to me. I'll never part with it and will play it every time I get the chance. It's great to have a good partner to play with who is as into it as I am. I can't recommend this outstanding war game enough.

Wow!!

I didn't expect this. I had read a lot of the comments and spoken to a few people that sang the praises of this game, but never did I imagine they were as right as they were.

War of the Ring is a masterpiece of game design.  

The way it manages to richly create a narrative that stays true to the source material, while still allowing for so much freedom in decision space, is incomparable.  

A truly amazing game.  Plays smoothly amidst so many moving parts and leaves the gamer with a rich story to tell.

A true ten, for design and enjoyment.

RATING: 10
I'm really struck by the successful melding of Tolkien's narrative with the strategy and tempo of this game. Once you get past the crunch of some of the rules, you really get a sense of an epic struggle that starts aggressively on the side of the Shadow while only coming to a head for the free peoples after a good amount of damage has already been done to Middle Earth. Meanwhile, the Fellowship strikes out quickly, while the Shadow doesn't intensify its search until later in the game. It creates a wonderfully tense dynamic between two different fronts for each player. 

Playing this solo in the context of some of my other solo plays of historical wargames and dudes-on-a-map games has given me a newfound appreciation of how special this one is. It's a classic for me. A keeper. A 10.

[b][i]War of the Ring[/i][/b] is a rare combination of great theme with great mechanics that work with the theme. 

Allow me to give a sampling of the decisions in a round of War of the Ring. The core mechanic is the action dice that you roll every round. The dice tell you what you can do this round, and since you only have at most 10 dice it might seem like you don't have that many options. In truth, there are many possibilities (and this can paralyze newer players). For example, suppose you rolled 3 army results. Those dice must be used to mobilize armies on the board, but there are so many choices on where to move. Are you going to use those dice to reinforce/assault the men in Minas Tirith? The men of Gondor are strong, but conquering Gondor puts the Shadow half-way to victory. Or should you help/attack the elves of Lothlorien? It's a single stronghold, but shadow control of Lothlorien is an ideal staging area for moving in many directions and if you take it early you can hopefully interfere with the Fellowship movement. Should you wait until the end of the round when your opponent is committed to a strategy or should you perform your moves immediately before your opponent has time to adjust his strategy? And what about your newly drawn Rohan-based action cards, are these powerful enough to switch your attention to the horse lords? Meanwhile, what about your opponent? Should you set the pace of the game through aggression or should you only react to their actions? These aren't easy decisions, but they are fun.

Behind the military deployment is the Fellowship progression which acts as a game clock which the players partially control. The variable game clock is clever game design, and it's seamlessly integrated into the theme. So well is the theme integrated into this game that you don't even think of it as a game mechanism, but rather as the Fellowship marching towards Mordor. If you can imagine the Witch-King proclaiming "Do you not know Death when you see it?" as he smashes Rivendell to put the Shadow within an inch of victory while the Free Peoples hurry the Fellowship through Mordor as they throw caution to the wind, then you should try this game. 

[b]Second Edition[/b]
The 2nd edition is better than the first edition every way. Well, to be super picky, the new dice decreased in quality. But this game is top-notch in every other way.

RATING: 9.5
If you like both Lord of the Rings and strategy war games, this game was made for you.  Spot on with the LotR theme, but still allows enough flexibility and decision making to make every game different.  Love the combination of action dice (luck) and character/event cards (strategy).  Highly recommend watching the tutorial video series by Gandalf the Grey (my_game) on the 1st edition WotR page as this game is rather rules intensive.

Never liked risk actually. Anyways play this game! I love the attack of the trent cards :) It feels like a massacring lost cause for the non shadow races, but i put my faith in the fellowship!  

For beginners always start as orcs, and do not hesitate to attack from the beginning! Use them hordes! The more time the humans have, the more of an advantage the orcs lose if they are not slaughtering.

Ok now, I really think I missed how good this game was for several reasons. Now I believe this is truly a work of wonder, one I would like to dedicate some time to explore.

I love this game. Yet I would prefer it with the first expansion at least. Lords of Middle Earth make this game certainly complex, but they add so many characters that you may even hear them whispering among themselves as they struggle for the survival, or the downfall of their world.

UPDATE
One of the best games ever made.

Give me and my girlfriend any other game that takes 6+ hours to play and we will quietly pass. But playing WotR is some of the best quality time we spend together. 

It really is a matter of forgiving the game its flaws to enjoy it. The gameboard is barely legible (unless you're nerds like us and already have a pretty good idea where on the map one can find Mirkwood or Dale, etc.), the rules are complex and murky when having to do with fellowship movement, splitting and hunting, and the rule book is not intuitive. Yet we love the theme, and it captures the theme so well, that we'd rather play the game than watch the movies again.

Packed with theme like a Snickers is packed with nuts! I like the balance of military and fellowship roles. Plays like two games in one. Have only ever played as the good guys with my mates awesome painted set. Keen to play this again (and again) to get deeper into the nuances of the system. Big map, but combat seems to always be focussed in the same places, with very little happening in the western portions.

Really like it, despite my usual aversion to Big Boxes of Plastic Minis. I'd rather have nice wooden tokens or cardboard counters for the military units, really, especially as some of the orc minis look quite stupid. The minis for the characters are quite nice, though. Would have made the game less expensive, and better looking IMO (I have no interest in painting or and I really dislike miniatures in general, even in RPGs). 

Not sure if it will have longevity, but it's great for now. Just about the best integration of a theme into game mechanics that I've seen, and yet it's full of nice little mechanisms, tough decisions, and risk/reward flashpoints. The only downside is the long play-time, but finding time is worth it.

Magnificent.

Updated: Played the other day. I taught a newbie how to play. He was a sharp gamer but this was his first game of WotR. He ended up winning! 

I don't feel like I made any mistakes. I captured every stronghold that I attacked. But the luck of the dice (I rolled tons of eyes in the first round and no musters) caused me to lose. This is just not a great strategy game; it's only a good strategy game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a highly asymmetrical wargame with several additional subsystems bolted onto it. Surprisingly, it all manages to work pretty well between equally experienced players. There's a certain amount of frustration in playing the Free Peoples, who are designed (out of fidelity to the book) to function as a punching bag with limited options to engage in battles on the (beautiful) world map. I generally regard playing Shadow as more enjoyable and strategically complex. Attempts to implement the same level of creativity while playing the Free Peoples, say by launching daring assaults on Shadow strongholds, usually just result in an embarrassingly lopsided loss.

RATING: 7
In short, this is a lovingly made game that provides a platform for players to play out an epic battle between one another without too many mechanisms getting in the way.

War of the Ring is an amazing asymmetrical (yet balanced) game in which the (weaker) Fellowship must sneak through to Mount Doom through the (militarily stronger) Sauron player to deliver that one damning blow (i.e., destroying the ring). Not only can the the respective players win by setting out to achieve their goals -- but pushing too hard here might result in defeat as well: if the Fellowship recklessly sneaks to Mordor, they might fail and falter to corruption (i.e., losing) and if Sauron is too reckless in his advance, the Free Peoples might sneak behind enemy lines to capture a few places (i.e., losing). This risk/reward system pushes palyers into a dragged out match in which no one wants to blow their stamina on one final punch -- its a tense marathon match rather than a quickly ended street fight.

The diverse cards are the heart of the game -- providing the meat to incentivize different and divergent explorations of what could have been in Middle Earth (especially partnered with the potential range of choices provided by the dice). While none of them seem broken, there seems to be a great balance between powerful yet highly contextual cards and highly flexible yet less powerful cards.  

If one can find any fault with the game is that it is long. Not too long -- as the game is quite engrossing -- but long enough that it might be difficult to schedule in that 4+ hours.

However, it is a 4+ hour stretch that is well spent, generally tense -- yet while simultaneously seeming light, breathable. A stupendous design.

Outstanding game!  My son and I have played 6 games (and now in the middle of our 7th), and it is currently our favorite game.  

The designers did a great job with this one.  They did a nice job sticking to the theme of the book/movie.  All but one of our 6 games were extremely close with a lot of momentum changes.  In a recent game, just when the Shadow army looked like it could not be stopped, Frodo destroys the ring and brings victory to the Free People's army!

The components are very nice (high quality board/cards), but I do wish they would have went with different shades of blue for the different Free People's armies and different shades of red for the different Shadow types.  It does make it challenging for setting up and, at times, playing.  But, overall, we think it has great components.

This is definitely the most complicated game I have ever played, but it was worth the wait in learning.  The manual is well done for such a complicated game, but I still had to read it about 3 times and come to these boards a few times before I felt confident we were playing it correctly.

This is an awesome game, and I would recommend it for those who are into heavier games and have the patience to read and take in a fairly large rulebook.

What a great game!
It's thematic as can be. Should i take the short but dangereous route through Moria or the longer route over the Highpass? Gandalf died defending Minas Tirith, etc.. 

The asymetrical powers are impletmented greatly. As the fellowship you're hopelessly outnumbered when it comes to the east, but can make some ground in the west. You're basically only trying to hold out. It's a constant balancing between the threats, capturing two stronghold or getting the ring to Mordor. Beautiful!
Best blending of theme via mechanics!

Sauron knows that the fellowship is coming his way but how much ressources is he going to spend? Too much and he looses some crucial battles, too little and they slip through his net.

Setup time is long, as is the first learning game. But it's worth it.

This game is excellent! It is very thematic and thorough in its representation of the books. The game does take a while to play, but it doesn't feel slow because each player alternates resolving actions so you are always doing something. The only reason I didn't rate it a "10" is because it requires a significant time commitment to learn and play (which is totally worth it) that unfortunately limits how frequently, and with whom, you can play it.

A final thought: I have had more fun losing this game than winning many others. After each play, I had a story to tell as if I just helped write a LoTR fan-fiction novel.

Spectacular recreation of the lord of the rings trilogy. It has everything in it! My only complaint is that it just seems so hopeless as the free people, which it should! It's fantastic that the stories that come out of it are from gameplay rather than event cards. Killing off Saruman with my army lead by Pippin and Gandalf or losing Aragorn and Gimli in the battle for Minis Tirith are things that you decide for yourself. It's a fantastic game and everyone who loves strategy games should play it.

This is a top 40 game from my personal game list.  It excels as both a 2-player and 4-player game military game steeped in theme .  What makes this game great is that it uniquely captures the tensions from both perspectives.  Playing the fellowship you constantly feel the impending doom of the Shadows military strength and the fear of being hunted.  As the Shadow player you feel the tension of the fellowship constantly slipping through your fingers and drawing ever closer to mount doom and destroying all your plans.

Didn't like the WoME expansion as much as I thought, it's too complicated and gives too much importance to tertiary characters/factions.

This is either 5 or 8. Played it once and didn't quite finish.

I really like that there is art and no movie shots. I think in games like these it's fun to see how the designers worked various events into the game. 

The core game is basically Risk with chrome, so the battles aren't very interesting. I think this would work much better as CDG.

Dice building, simultaneous race for victory on different areas, multi-purpose cards, clever hidden movement a la quantum decoherence, building up tension, strategic decisions for the Fellowship of the ring, almost no directly occult elements, high quality game components. What to expect more?

RATING: 10
  War of the Ring is an epic 2-4 player thematic war game based on the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It pits 1-2 Shadow Player(s) against 1-2 Free People Player(s).

  The components in War of the Ring are outstanding. The two boards in the game form a colossal map of Middle-Earth. The miniatures that populate the board are beautifully sculpted and depict the characters that they represent accurately. The red miniatures personify the Shadow Player's hoards of minions, while on the other hand, the blue miniatures portray the Free Peoples Player's small reserve of soldiers. Along side the miniatures are the gorgeous action dice, six for the Free Peoples Player and ten for the Shadow Player. They follow the color coding of the miniatures. Each side has an engraved icon that represents the action you can take with that side. The Giant map of Middle-Earth is complemented by Tarot cards. Both players have two decks of these cards, entitled event decks, which signify notable happenings from the trilogy of books. Overall, the components are amazing.       

  War of the Ring is played over a series of rounds, each broken down into six phases. The first phase is simple. Each player recovers the action dice he used in the previous turn and draws one card from each of his event decks. Following this phase, the Fellowship Phase consists of the Free Peoples Player making vital decisions for the Fellowship of the Ring, such as declaring the location of the Fellowship, healing the Fellowship, and changing the Guide of the Fellowship. Next is the Hunt Allocation phase, where the Shadow Player can place dice on their 'Eye of Sauron' side in the Hunt Box. The more dice the Shadow Player puts in the Hunt Box, the harder it is for the Fellowship to reach Mordor. If the Shadow Player allocates too many dice into the Hunt Box, the Shadow Player will only have a few actions to spend during the fifth phase. However, the Shadow player can only allocate as many dice as the fellowship has companions. In the fourth phase, both players roll their action dice. The Shadow Player takes any 'Eye of Sauron' results and puts them in the Hunt Box. The fifth phase, the action resolution phase, is the heart and soul of the game. During this phase, the players take turn spending the action dice the rolled to play event cards, muster troops, conduct sieges, make diplomatic actions, and much more. Finally, there is the victory check phase.

  War of the Ring is an amazing game. Everything from the mechanics to the artwork is stunning. This game is an absolute blast to play, although it can go on long for those who don't care for long games. Every second of this game, however, is immensely engaging.        

  In short this game is second to none. This is the ultimate thematic experience for the Lord of the Rings. If you don't already own it, buy it.

RATING: 7
This is an excellent game.  Lots of fun.  There is, however, a massive set-up and tear down time with War of the Ring as well as a lot of rulebook to digest before you can really get playing at a properly rapid rate.  A first and even second game has a lot of agonizing referring to the rulebook.  This is an epic, long event.  Plan that day accordingly.

I really love this game. It captures the intense decision making that the ring bearers made during their journey. This game does not give an importance to any thing not an important decision to the people of middle earth. The miniatures are fun, the board is big, and overall the game feels epic. My 11 year old son plays this game well, and the smaller children can play this, too. I have the smaller children play as a team member, so if they leave the game or need help deciding what to do their partner, and more experienced player, can assist. This game plays relatively fast, and after finishing a game I feel like I just played an epic game all day.

I've played the 1st edition many times. I don't see much of a difference in the 2nd edition, which I regard as something of a failure by the new publishers. They should have tightened the rule book, but it is still needlessly lengthy, vaguely-worded where it needs to be precise, and difficult to use as a reference.  

Being a Middle Earth afficionado, I'll play War of the Ring as the nearest tabletop experience to recreating events in the LoTR. However, I am often frustrated as the game has a number of flaws. As others have commented, it is basically a slightly more advanced version of Risk with a large number of cards that you cycle through to get to the relatively small number of useful ones. Using dice to drive the game makes it a little different to Risk, but just adds another layer of chance on top of that inherent in the battles and the card decks.  The fellowship mechanics are rather fiddly, considering that it all boils down to chance again - in the hunt die rolls and the drawing of the chits from a bag.   

I've just played the game for the first time as a 4-player, and will be very reluctant to do so again. It doesn't really work as a multiplayer game - it just feels as though the designers cobbled together a few rules in order to enable it to be played by more than two.

An outstanding “High-Fantasy” wargame that captures the books without overloading the players with a lot of constraints, and yet it achieves something that resembles the actual story.  I have played this game well over a dozen times and it remains fresh and immersive. It’s a rich experience, where the game does not compromise much of the story for the sake of “speed of play”, but it is still playable in an evening. And the way the different mechanics are integrated into game-play in order  to reflect the theme, is remarkable.  Overall, it is a really well designed game with great production quality. 

There are two expansions; once you get the hang of it, I’d recommend adding the Lords of Middle Earth Expansion.

One of the great games that I have played. I love it. I think that it is highly thematic, usually the events that happen on the book are there without you almost noticing, it is highly strategic, it has around 200 miniatures and, above all, it is repayable.
One of the things that I like from this game, is the action-reaction structure. With this I mean that if the shadow player decides to attack the Shire, which only worths 1 point, but usually is unprotected because no one expects the shadow doing that move, then the free folks player will have to answer that move, and probably that was not his/her idea at any time. I think that this point is what it makes so great this game and provides some great moments.
To me, the only thing that I may not be completely in favor is the ring mechanic. I totally get that this time mechanic avoids the game to go on forever, but it gives like a estrange feeling of victory or defeat, unepic I would say. You are defending Rohan, fighting at Moria and trying to save a desperate invasion at Lorien and then, suddenly, it all ends because you draw a tile with high corruption. It is part of the game and it is ok, but, I mean, it is not as epic as conquering Edoras, Lorien and Minas Tirith.
To sum up:
Positive:
- Highly thematic
- Epic battles
- Tons of miniatures and components
- Highly strategic
Negative
- Finishing the game by "Ring" can be a bit un-epic
- It is a very long game. To be planned in advance
- There are so many cards and characters and rules that, if you do not play from time to time (maybe once every 9 months) it is a bit hard to remember everything
- It is one of those games so complicated that you may have problems for finding a decent adversary (and that will want to play with you more than once)

We didnt finish the play (3hrs).  I think this game has tremendous thematic elements that might make it feel more fun then what it is.

Setting this game up is quite a task but sitting through it feels like the hours it takes to play this game just fly by.

The tension between each side maneuvering armies and advancing the ring bearers while they are being hunted really fits in with the theme.

The action dice randomness doesn't actually feel like a huge problem and brings a good amount of tension each time a hunt for the ring bearers happens.

Amazing game that is tied to its theme very well.

A great wargame of the books.  Yes, it's a wargame, not a role playing game.  Don't let the fantasy theme fool you, this game involves strategic warfare aspects such as marshaling allies, getting troops where they are needed and balancing attack and defense, all while trying to dunk the one ring.  The leader and strategy cards add variety.

Finally played it ten years after buying a copy! I made myself a promise not to play it until I'd painted it - which after a false start I put off for 9 1/2 years, during which time i picked up the 2nd edition upgrade kit and the anniversary edition board!

Thankfully, it was worth the wait - it's a stunning game. I can't see a better dudes-on-a-map Lord of the Rings game being created. The action dice, the fellowship movement / hunt for the ring, the cards and the army engine all fit together beautifully to create a believable alternative LOTR story as well as a tense, fun and challenging experience, that seems to go down to the wire in a tension-filled climax every time.

You can keep your 'elegant', interaction-free, efficiency-optimisation Euros, games like this are why I've loved the hobby for 50 years.

RATING: 10
War of the Ring is the ultimate Middle-earth gaming experience. In addition to its masterful design and deep gameplay, this game captures the tone and feel of the books brilliantly. While this game certainly offers a rich, robust strategic experience, much of the game comes down to which cards you draw, action die results, which tiles emerge from the Hunt Pool, and combat rolls.

Therefore, randomness does play a factor--quite a significant one. However, it is these very design choices that provide the tension, unpredictability, and overall magic of the game. These elements can (and will) lead to moments of frustration and elation for both players. The strategy of the game, then, involves executing and timing your decisions in ways that position you to benefit from the wide range of possibilities the game offers (and having solid contingency plans). If you are willing to accept this framework and embrace the game for what it is (and I am, even as a high strategy/low luck guy), this is a masterpiece.

RATING: 10
Played only twice so far, but man, this game is EPIC.  Also, it is just about perfectly themed and counterbalanced very, very well.  Excellent stuff and a dream come true for LotR fans.

The movement and battles are reminiscent of Risk, but the gameplay is more card/hand driven with asymmetrical endgame objectives, driving the strategy for both players.  What you end up getting is a real, true-to-form, Lord of the Rings adventure, replete with thematic objectives and sub-objectives that serve to help your main objective succeed.  (Note: I've only played as the good side so far, but my fellow gamer friend seems to love playing Sauron.) 

The setup is both long and intimidating, and the many rules can be tough to recall and incorporate without fail every turn, but even when you forget something here or there, the game doesn't suffer greatly for it.  It can drag on if either player isn't familiar with the many rules (or a less common situation that you are unsure about how to hande, e.g. a siege), or if a player takes long in thier decision-making, so be forwarned this is not for the ADHD Gamers; This game is a main event.  Also, you're gonna need a bigger table (said in Roy Schieder's voice for greater effect).  

All in all, this is a can't miss, slam dunk game for the LotR fan- and for gamers in general.  If I could afford the Collector's edition, I'd actually consider buying it, even at its astronomical price point.  It's that good.

I am a huge LOTR fan and I honestly don't think the trilogy could possibly have been better captured in cardboard than it is here.  The dedication to the theme and lore combined with the elegance of the actual game mechanics provide a great argument as to why board games can be considered art.  While the ~42 page rulebook and myriad of game mechanics to intertwine can be daunting, pushing through the learning curve reveals an incredibly rewarding experience and a new alternate LOTR story every playthrough to share with an equally dedicated gaming partner.

Big expansive game with a very unique and interesting element of sneaking the ring into Mordor.  The battle is your basic risk style approach with strengths of armies determining number of dice.  The cards do add some interesting changes to battle but the system is very basic and not the driving force in this game.  The hunt for the ring add a lot of flavor and feel and certainly needs to be a focus of the free peoples since he is at such a disadvantage in armies.  The miniatures are very similar and can bring a lot of confusion into the game (who is who?) so I painted the bases to match the map colors and that should take a way a lot of set up time and confusion during the game.  Not enough plays to make a firm conclusion on this game but I feel it will be something I keep long term that just doesn't get a ton of play but will be enjoyed when it does.

Man I wanted to like this. I'm a big fan of the books (probably have read them half a dozen times) and the movies but this game is just too slow for me. I played twice as Sauron and won both times but I took little pleasure from it. The first was a military victory which was okay but the second was a corruption of the Ring-bearers in Mordor which was just lame and just felt like luck. I know that the fact that I loaded the bag in my favor was a big part of the strategy and why I won but it didn't really feel that way. I think I would like playing the free peoples even less. This one just doesn't do it for me. If it was the only game I owned I'd certainly play it again but with so many other choices, this one is unlikely to hit the table again.

I've owned this 2nd Edition as well as the original Collector's Edition with painted miniatures and the big wooden box.  Ultimately all the bits and the Tolkien theme are the real attraction here.  Less so the game mechanics themselves.  I'm a huge fantasy nut but I've never really been a big Tolkien/LOTR fan so ultimately a game which has a primary purpose of simulating the story in the books isn't going to have much staying power with me.  It's long, complex, and yet samey game to game.  I'd happily be your opponent for the game every now and then but there are just better games to own these days from a game mechanics standpoint.  I would still re-acquire the game if our son ever became a Tolkien fan so I certainly understand the love some have for this game.

1 partida.

Jugué con los buenos, que tengo entendido que son con quien es más difícil ganar. Además, hice muchas cosas pensando una estrategia que luego resultó que no podía hacerse con arreglo a las reglas, ya que no las conocía apenas. Así que no tengo mucho credibilidad al puntuar este juego, pero lo que me pareció fue lo siguiente:

Es un juego excesivamente largo y, al parecer, demasiado descompensado. Además, la dinámica de juego no hace que merezca la pena tanto tiempo.

A really well thought out game.  It has a lot of strategic depth and replay value.  Unfortunately the rules are many and the game takes guidance to learn.  Once you get through that muck, you will still have questions on certain plays.  That being said, I have it at 10 for a reason.  It is more than sum of its parts, and this game has great theme, interesting strategy and great attention to detail in the dice, flavor, and quality.

First game. 2P. Tons of fun, took a while to get the rules down but once you get into a groove time flies by and it's lots of fun. Just when as the shadow player just as it felt like I was barreling towards victory cockily running my lines out I nearly got beat at the last moment by a couple well planned sneak attacks. Tons of fun, lots of strategies possible and a great nerd-out for LotR fans.

Beautifully designed game, great artwork and minis, but you will definitely want to paint the bases of the minis to distinguish at a glance the various allied races.  Biggest gripe: Horrible play balance.  Between competent players the Shadow player will win 90% of the games by simply overwhelming Gondor.  Where's the fun in that?  Worst play tested game I have ever played.  I never play the game anymore but use the minis as components in an RPG board game I am designing.

There's a fair bit of rules.  The mechanics and theme go well together.  It's random but not random and is gripping the entire time.  First play through took 6 hours including 40 minutes to eat and time spent learning rules & deciding.

Needs a LOT of space because the board is massive.  Miniatures are hard to tell apart so I painted the bases of mine using a colour for each army.  It would have been unbearable if I hadn't so I can see why that's a common complaint.

In War of the Ring, one player takes control of the Free Peoples (FP), the other player controls Shadow Armies (SA). Initially, the Free People Nations are reluctant to take arms against Sauron, so they must be attacked by Sauron or persuaded by Gandalf or other Companions, before they start to fight properly: this is represented by the Political Track, which shows if a Nation is ready to fight in the War of the Ring or not.

Second ed improved several things over the first.  The board, for one thing, looks better.  (think about it - the first ed board looked like Italy - brown)  For me, the best change was in the size of the cards.  I can read these now.

Excellent partially card driven game pitting the forces of good in Middle Earth against the forces of evil.  Several paths to victory exist for both sides although the Fellowship will often be key to victory for the Free Peoples and likely should be pushed pretty hard.  Dice rolls determine what actions may be taken by both sides and will sometimes frustrate and force you in a different than intended direction.  The two sides are asymmetrical in certain aspects and the Free People also have to be aware their casualties are permanent whereas the Shadow Armies are able to return casualties to their reinforcement pool.  

I do wish there were different color bases for each of the the different nations/groups.  They can be difficult to distinguish.

RATING: 7
The rulebook is good: it is nicely laid out, clear, and easy enough to use as a reference while playing. 

The production quality is good. The plastic is a little soft, but the figures are well sculpted. The game generally looks nice: clear and large map, nice drawings on all the tokens, the card font is relatively large,… Now, the design is not fully functional: identifying the Nation of all the figures is not easy (they should have a colored base), the thresholds for the military winning conditions could be indicated with colored numbers on the victory point track,… Not bad but not perfect. 

I found it easy to connect with the theme, except for the occasional card whose title did not ring a bell. The situations that arise in the game are reminiscent of the story (retreating into Helm's Deep is a decision that can reallly make sense, Saruman can easily summon many troops, etc. Now, I still get much less theme than in another longer game like Twilight Struggle, where the pictures help (no pictures on the busy War of the Ring cards), and where the events are more varied and therefore more easily recognizable and enjoyable. 

If the theme is less enjoyable than in Twilight Struggle, what remains that could make this game especially enjoyable? Combat is obviously an important facet of this game. But Heroscape offers many more laughs, and Kemet packs combat in a shorter time frame, and gives more diverse fighting powers. 

What remains is a game where the theme is well integrated but where it doesn't make the game incredible, and neither do the mechanics. 

Another thematic mechanic is the Corruption, and the hiding and hunt of the Fellowship. This mechanics gives some tension but remains relatively simple, with a good dose of randomness (through the hunt dice and the hunt tiles). 

All on all, the game ultimately is too long for what I get from it. It is well done, in terms of reproducing many aspects of the original story, but nothing wows me. I am guessing that part of the reputation of this game comes from geeks who love everything Lord of the Rings.

Second Edition of the infamous strategic board game War of the Ring! While Frodo and his companions are on their way to Mordor, Sauron tries to trace the location of the ring bearer and sends his armies on the last strongholds of the free peoples. Will the Ring return to its master or will the ring bearer fulfill his mission? In this beautiful board game full of beautiful miniatures, the epic battles in Middle-Earth (known from Lord of the Rings) are re-enacted. The dice mechanism determines every action that a player has. This second edition of the famous game has a clearer game board and larger cards with even better balanced effects. Nice game if you love lord or the rings

不對等的戰爭遊戲，忠實地表現出魔戒之戰那種困窘處境。

My 1st edition comment: "There's a lot happening for this game, and I respect everything it set out to do. Theme-wise, it has come second only to Confrontation for Tolkien games. The action dice system is one of the best parts; every other dice mechanic it has (read: combat) is what kills this game. Bah. Still, a good time and a better spectator sport."

The new edition is much like the first.  The production is outstanding and the art beautiful.  I was taught the first edition and had to teach myself this edition, so I can say categorically that the rulebook is pretty terrible.  It's organized in a way that's not useful, and provides few examples and little indication of exceptions.

Probably the best war game ever made.  The game pits Sauron agains the Free Peoples.  Each player rolls their dice and actions are derived from the dice roll.  Cards provide advantages for actions as well as combat.  It is very interesting choices about what cards to hold and play and what to throw away.  At times, cards cannot help you early but do help late and vice versa.  The sculpts are very nice.  And the board is a map that is pretty readable and easy to understand.  There is more than one way to win for each side.  And you need to stay flexible based on your cards.  

It is heavy and will take you 3-4 hours to play but it is a great experience.

I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and can't wait to play it again.  This time with a better grasp of the rules.  Great game.  If you can pick this up and have a good friend you can play this with then do so.  I can't really see this as a 3-4 player game but there are rules for it.  I'm gonna keep it 2 players for me.

The best representation of The Lord of the Rings in board game form.  I love that the game represents the books so well and so accurately, and yet they managed to make it feel almost perfectly balanced.  The balance is there even though both sides are very asymmetric.  I can't wait to grab the expansion once it comes back in stock.  I want that Balrog mini!

One minor issue: the minis are very hard to distinguish.  I did a single color acrylic paint job to each nation to help set them apart.  Don't do any dipping or washing with oils!  The oil doesn't play well at all with the plastic on these minis for some reason.

Even though I love everything about this game, it does feel a little repetitive with frequent plays.  Ultimately it's the LotR story each and every time, and you need to be in the mood for that.

Oh, this is a gazillion times better than the LotR card game.

Starting with the first edition and on to the second I really love this game. I have trouble finding people to play it against me, unfortunately, as it's a longish investment (3-4 hours usually) and only 2 players. (Yes, there are rules for 3-4 players but they don't seem to actually add very much to the game.) One of my favorite things is the storytelling flavor- we can tell terrific after-stories of Boromir helping break the siege of Lorien, or the time Merry almost killed Saruman with a Blade of Westernesse.
The second edition rebalanced several minor issues with the first edition (some of which had been addressed by the first edition's expansion, which had come with its own issues). I think it's worth getting the upgrade pack if you already have the first edition.

I've been a Tolkien fan since I was a wee lad (obvious from my other owned games)and this is the definitive LOTR game. I love everything about it and of course, the theme. You are able to submerse yourself in the world Tolkien created and play out the adventure to your own conclusion.  I could gush all day about the game but those who know, know. If you love Tolkien and don't own this game, you need to get a copy, even if it's just to have.  My minis are finally painted, now even more flavor to an already rich game!

Loved this game the first 7-8 times I played it, and still really enjoy playing occasionally. But after a certain number of play-throughs more of the weaknesses of the game began to surface. For one, the whole western side of the map is often untouched, a huge amount of space which is all too often completely irrelevant. Furthermore I found the dwarves and the north, in about 50-70% of games are either inactive or see one or two instances of combat but are otherwise irrelevant. I think more playtesting would have revealed these flaws and the game could have been more streamlined. 
Having said all that I love various features of the game and find the theme and epic-ness of the layout and pieces very attractive. I feel the combat mechanics as well as event/combat cards (and tough decisions of when to play them) are fairly balanced and the difficulty of besieging very well executed. I am also a huge fan of the alternate paths to victory and the corruption of the ring adds an essential element to the game.

Wonderfully thematic game. The mechanics are very well designed, components and overall art are great.

A must have for any LotR fan that likes strategy games, or anyone that likes strategy games overall.

The game is built to keep you close to the edge of winning or losing everytime you play and it does that very well without feeling artificial.

Very thematic!

It's really a fantastic game for every fan of Tolkien an not.
You can feel the story of The lord of the ring, It's  very balanced and a very strategic game, it has a wonderfull setting and fantastic game play.
Just a note about the playing time, it's a very long game and it is for 2 players, i think that in 4 players there isn't the same experience of play than in 2.

Quite heavy strategy game with a good chunk of randomness. Essentially for 2 players only (since game is asymmetric - one player controls the "good guys", the other "bad guys". But of course you may include as many people as you wish to either side, but still all people must make a move together. Game is extremely long (3-6 hours) and set-up is quite lengthy as well. Recommended for players who like some deep strategy and are not afraid of dice randomness.

An awesome asymmetric war-game covered in a bucketload of theme.  An excellent game, which is very true to the theme of the books. Dudes on a map + action selection based on dice rolls + built in game timer with the fellowship party.    Everything just works.  Keen to try it again soon as the rules are reasonably complex - but well worth investing the time in.  Epic.

A masterpiece. The best thematic game you could possibly find. All the events and stuff depicted in Tolkien´s Lord of the Rings are brought into play in this boardgame. Knowing the cards is a must cause in case you don´t and your opponent does ... well, you´ll be in a clear disadvantage. Oddly enough the randomness of the dice does not spoil my like for this game.

In general, I haven't enjoyed war games, but something about War of the Ring makes it feel like so much more than that.  Thus far, I've only managed to play a few times, but each experience left me itching for more.  It kept me thinking about things I could've done differently and how I could improve my performance. The diversity of options and the split goals between military and the ring give this game so much strategic promise and entertainment.  This is easily the most enjoyable two-player game I've played, and I can see it becoming a 10 after a few more plays.

Just picked up the 2nd edition from the recent reprint after waffling about this game for a long time. I wish the plastic army guys had some identifying mark on them. I'm sure once one has played the game a few times, the pieces become familiar, but for new players, it can be confusing. I may steal Ricky Royal's idea and put color markings around the bases of the pieces.

This game is actually much deeper than I anticipated. I think the rules for hidden movement of the Fellowship and the rules for hunting the Fellowship by the Dark Forces are sort of genius. Reminds me of the type of out of the box thinking that Mark Herman has used in some of his games. There are actually quite a few cool gameplay mechanic ideas in this design. It's also the most thematic War of the Rings game I've seen. (well, SPI's old game has a lot of theme, but it never worked for me)

Looking forward to more plays.

RATING: 10
I bought the upgrade kit and downloaded the 2nd edition rules, so I haven't played on the newest map. But other than that, I think it plays equally well. I haven't played enough times to comment on balance issues, but my one game using 2nd edition cards and rules came down to the last tile draw: All of the companions were dead or split off, Gollum was the guide and corruption was at 11. On the previous tile draw, I had the option of revealing in order to keep the corruption at 10, but doing so would have meant using the last of  my character action dice to hide the Fellowship, meaning I'd have to wait until the following turn to try and move--with some small chance of not getting any character or will of the west dice. So I didn't do it, used the die to move and prevailed when Sauron drew a '0' tile.

Si tienes toda una tarde para recrear toda la trilogía del señor de los anillos solo tienes que desplegar este juego. Sinceramente, transmite a la perfección lo visto en las películas al tablero. Juego muy estratégico e inmersivo, es una gozada ver el despliegue de ejércitos. Épico.

RATING: 6
Well, I don't get what is so fantastic about the game.  It does pretty decent job at recreating the books except there is a lot of character death.  However, there seems to be a lot of fiddling about, moving armies around when the game appears to boil down to if the Fellowship goes corrupt or reaches the crack of Doom.  Maybe the high raters have never played a game like this before, and it seems new and exciting?  And all that plastic really gets in the way.  The dice are nice, though!

It's definitely the closest to Lord of the Rings in a box that you'll find right now. Even though the rule book is quite large, I don't think the game is too terribly complex. I find it to be Risk with more chrome, even though that gives it a bad connotation. My early plays make it feel like the fellowship/corruption win is just luck of the draw and rather unsatisfying.

Finally got a chance to play War of the Ring, and I'm quite impressed. The theme is excellent, and I really enjoy that it has more of a "classic Tolkien" feel rather than an updated version based on the films. 

I'm a sucker for asymmetrical gameplay and card powers so this game really hits for me on a lot of levels. The strategy can be a bit obtuse; similar to Twilight Struggle you have to play and lose once to clearly see what you need to do "next time".

My first gripe is that the minis all look very similar. I'd take a can of primer and an airbrush to these if I owned it myself so as to create some distinction between the different factions. My second is that it can be easy for new Free People players to forget they have units under siege. Multiple times I simply counted a stronghold as lost and moved my plans elsewhere, only to realize to too late they my units were simply off on the side of the board, waiting to be destroyed. This is something I won't forget again, obviously, but I feel like this could be easily fixed with an on-board siege token of some kind.

Can't wait to play again!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Take actions to destroy the One Ring (Fellowship) or to hunt the ringbearer and conquer Middle Earth (Sauron).

Plays: 1
Type: Thematic faux wargame = a theme-driven game where you move military forces on a map, but where victory isn't intrinsically about conquest or destruction of enemies.
Complexity: Medium.
# of players: 2.
Playing time: See BGG.
Player interaction: Conflict.
Randomness: Medium - card draw and dice, with some control over how to apply results.

Replayability: Low, once in a while is good enough. The strategy seems fairly straight-forward and the action dice will decide much of what you can do anyway. The theme is strong, so those that like the theme will probably want to play more often. It's too long for what it is though.
Fun: Some fun. This looks fun to play with all the different miniatures on the large map. Rolling lots and lots of pretty dice is fun. The hunt for the One Ring is thematic fun. Summoning the Witch King to conquer Minas Tirith is fun (for Sauron). Saying "Fly, you fools" when Gandalf sacrifices himself to save the Ringbearer is fun. The fun is mostly in the theme and not so much in the game though.
Memorability: Good. This lets the players re-tell the story of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

Thematic integration: Great. This is designed theme-first.
Components: Great. The different peoples of Middle Earth have different minis. There are lots and lots of minis. The fellowship and Sauron minion minis are high quality and look great. The unique action dice are heavy and look great. The components are certainly not functional however; the minis are a pain to tell apart, they don't really fit in the map regions and the map borders could be a lot clearer. The game is designed to look fantastic, functionality being a secondary concern. The same could be said for the rules.

Who will like this: LotR fans who enjoy heavy games.

RATING: 8.1
Played once, with Justin, when he visited me in October 2014 for the game bonanza.  This game is a wargame with VERY asymmetrical armies and indeed rules - failed dice rolls for the good guys will add dice to Sauron's rolls.  The people of Middle Earth struggle to defend their paltry strongholds against the hordes of Mordor &c, blah blah - but the best part of the game, as the Good Guy in our playthrough, was the mechanics for Frodo et al, the Fellowship.  It has been a while now but I still remember JUST how cagey I had to be, moving those fellows, up to and then especially AFTER, the splitting of the fellowship.

If I had some extra money (nope) and a close friend who lived close by and would be willing to table this game consistently (uncertain at best), I would have bought this game years ago.  For now: a pipe dream.

This is "the" Lord of the Rings game, as it most closely follows the book trilogy in events. Even the map forces players to follow certain paths.
I prefer to play this with 4 players as it lessens the intensity of the game which is a good thing in a game that takes around 4 hours to complete. The tension though remains high throughout and increases towards the end when one error of judgement (or poor dice roll) can spell disaster.
RECOMMENDED.

Better than I remember from my first play. At the same time, this really is just a slower-paced, two player variant of Risk. The game is almost completely about the combat. The Fellowship really just feels tacked-on to the entire experience. Don't get me wrong, I'd still play this over LOTR Risk, but that's not really saying much with some of the more recent Risk titles they've been coming out with. If I'm going to play a LOTR game, I'd rather stick to Knizia's cooperative game.

Can Frodo and Sam get the One Ring to Mount Doom or will Sauron's forces ultimately destroy the Free Peoples of Middle-Earth? With tons of theme, the outcome of the Third Age is now a matter of 'What Ifs'. What if Gandalf died and stay dead? What if Minas Tirith had fallen? What if Aragorn died at the hands of the Balrog of Moria? All of these scenarios and more are possibilities in a game that lets you reimagine not only the trip to Mordor, but the impact of the War of the Ring on the entirety of Middle-Earth. Great game.

[b]Theme: 5/5[/b]

[b]Length: 4/5[/b]

[b]Mechanics: 2/5[/b]: The low point, in my opinion. The mechanics do a lot to bring the theme to life, but it is at a detriment. A war game where you have to rally up troops is kinda lame. It just feels like there's way too much build up before the actually fighting. The movement rules for leaders, including setting the guide, can be a bit gamey, but that's not really a huge deal. Combat doesn't feel particularly fun, taking actions doesn't feel particularly fun. This game is a lot like if you wrote a good fanfiction of the actual novel. It's interesting, but does it make you feel ecstatic when writing it? Probably not.

[b]Balance: 4/5[/b] I think the game is balanced pretty well between the both sides in turns of win ratio, but I've heard quite a few Sauron players say that the game feels monotonous cause it's just raising waves and chunking them at a wall. While this is very thematic, it doesn't contribute to fun. Which is ultimately more important when making a board game.

Sehr gute Umsetzung des Buches / der Filme in ein strategisches Brettspiel. Ein Spieler übernimmt die böse Seite (die Dunklen Truppen bzw. Sauron) und der andere die gute Seite (die Freien Völker bzw. die Gemeinschaft des Ringträgers). Das Ziel ist bekannt: die gute Seite will den Ring im Schicksalsberg vernichten, die böse Seite will die gute Seite unterjochen bzw. den Ringträger korrumpieren. 
Beim Spielen kommt die Atmosphäre des Fantasythemas aus meiner Sicht gut durch und es macht Spaß, den Handlungsstrang so quasi hautnah mitzuverfolgen und sogar zu gestalten. Denn es ist nicht gesagt, dass die gute Seite gewinnt...

RATING: 4
War Of The Ring is a sprawling game, massive in scope, time commitment, board size, and number of components. It truly does evoke the feel of Tolkein's saga, and despite my love for the books, this game is not for me.

Beyond the 3-5 hour play duration, there are several other things about WotR that irk me: Clunky mechanics require players to keep the rulebook handy for constant rule clarifications; limited figurine color palette makes factions of the same player's forces hard to differentiate; dependency on dice results and card draws for actions can railroad a player's choices, making strategizing difficult (especially the Free Peoples player who has less dice); dice rolling for combat results is no better than Risk; and finally, I find the game just too damn stressful.

Despite my issues with it, I can tell WotR would be right up some people's alley, but personally I will stick with Lord Of The Rings: Confrontation for my Middle Earth fix.

Fun game.  Without lucky rolls, it is hard to defeat defenders in fortifications, as they can keep reinforcing and you have to have 6s to hit, but they only 5 or 6.  Military didn't quite have the epic back and forth that I was hoping for.  Maybe in some of the 'Lords of Middle Earth' scenarios?

RATING: 8
Highly thematic, dramatic, and fun. With luck playing such a large part, it's difficult to tell when mistakes are made and how to improve. Since the game is so asymmetric, its hard to know who is really winning. For a 2-player war-game it is nicely non-hostile, since the free people are just trying to survive long enough to destroy the ring (or capitalize on a strategic blunder made by the shadow). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Another huge, thematic, asymmetric 2p-er like Twilight Struggle, but this is much more of a direct wargame. The extra layer of the fellowship and the hunt is very interesting, as each player must decide how much resources to devote to each strategy.

The loads of fiddly rules and long set-up is a bit of a turn-off. I like that it can be converted into a pretty good 2v2 game though (but watch out for those extra rules).

RATING: 6
Non il mio genere di gioco. Innumerevole miniature, ambientazione molto curata, diverse possibilità di giungere alla vittoria, materiali mastodontici e durata epica per un gioco che personalmente mi ricorda un Risiko molto meglio ambientato e curato. Il gioco rimane fortemente condizionato da tiri di dadi e pesca delle carte, che sono la base del gioco. Lo consiglio sicuramente agli amanti della saga perché il gioco sa ricreare molte situazioni. A me però lascia un po' di amaro in bocca.

RATING: 10
Very heavy and challenging to pick up due to the number of procedures involved. The depth and complexity is phenomenal though, and the way the makers have balanced a non-symmetrical game like this, with so many variables, is incredible.

One thing that this game conjures is a sense of drama, as you get scenarios like Gimli raising the Iron Hills dwarves and leading a dwarf army to the gates of Mordor, forcing Sauron to slow his assault elsewhere to tackle the dwarves; or Gandalf launching a surprise attack into Ithilien round the back of the Mordor army. Or Aragorn leaving the Fellowship of the Ring early to race to the defence of Gondor ahead of the party. The sense of impending doom felt by the Free Peoples player is quite strong though and can make it stressful.

Great game, but one for when you have a lot of time on your hands.

RATING: 7
Played once as SA. I was just learning the game, so it was a bit overwhelming--a feeling not unlike when I feebly attempt to play Go or Tigris & Euphrates. There are so many options on a given turn, even with the limitations of the action dice dealt, that I'm drowning in the possibilities. It can be paralyzing. Even with overly cautious shadow play, the game came down to one tile draw, and Frodo was corrupted on the precipice of Mount Doom. I think I need to focus more on military movement, diverting the free people's attention from the quest next time.

Playing again. I like the action dice. It prevents repeat strategies and AP. I am concerned based on my first two full games that the war is just a distraction from the fellowship's quest, which can end just based on a tile draw.

I think I'm going to trade away, sadly. Just takes far too long for what it is. If I were in college again I'd probably play every day, but as it is it will come out twice a year against people who already own the game anyway.

The best implementation of LotR in a board game that I know of, but with a couple of weaknesses. First, the rule book - bad structure, many details that have to be looked up time and again, but then where again exactly was that sentence in the rules...? Second, it lacks diversity and feels repetitive after a while. On the other hand, it's indeed very thematic and epic.

The perfect game based on Tolkien's works. I will always play this game. I have the Anniversary edition which just accentuates the experience. The dual use cards and action dice make for a lot of interesting decisions. If you love Lord of the Rings and can handle complex board games, get this game. You won't regret it. Play this mostly with my wife and other than the first couple plays is tense every time right down to the wire.

RATING: 10
One of the best two player [and thus non-diplomacy dependent] games out there.
The game mechanics ensure both players are both active and reactive, and the mix-in of event cards and dice ensures that every turn is a mini-battle in and of itself: and even if no actual skirmish occurs during a turn, you have to be efficient and precise in your decisions and actions, otherwise you are left to prey that the other player will make mistakes/

Wonderful integration of meaningful game mechanics with the world and characters of the books.

If you told me that someone would publish a strategy game based on LOTR, I would have expected either a generic "lite" wargame or a thin reskinning of other systems.  Instead, we have something that feels richly true to the story while allowing thoughtful divergence from it.

This is the boardgame equivalent of Peter Jackson's film trilogy:  not what Tolkien would have written, but nevertheless a lovely realization of his vision in a new medium.

What to say about this masterpiece. For any fan of LotR here comes one of the best boardgames that I played. The board is huge and detailed so are the minis and the cards are quite nice and tarrot sizes so you can read it clearly. Artwork is beautiful and the gameplay even more so. 

Its a heavy Ameritrash game it relies on dice rolling (luck) lots of cards (luck) and lots of minis. Your actions are defined by your dice rolls and how to utilize those dice rolls even if they are not what you wanted is crucial to win.

Its a great 2 player game one player is Sauron and the forces of Shadow and the other is playing as all the Free Folk in Middle-Earth. All my games have been won 50/50 for both sides so its a really balanced game no matter what side you play.

Comment: This game is fantastic. The component quality is amazing, the theme is very well integrated and it feels epic with all the pieces and large board size. I have 2 complaints against this game. They only used 2 colors for the majority of the pieces. A lot of the army unit look so similar and it's hard to tell the difference between the elves/rohan/north, etc. My second complaint is that it feels a bit scripted after a few plays. Not a ton of variance in gameplay from what I've seen.

RATING: 7.5
2 plays, initial rating an 8.  This is a fantastic game.  The asymmetric sides and the card play makes the theme very strong.  Luck plays a factor in your tactical options, but does not hamstring you.  In the first game the shadow player had many cards to effect a revealed fellowship, and decimated the party early on, then switched to full-military conquest as the fellowship was a bit more timid to try and move; strong shadow victory.  Second game fellowship split off early and often, sending strong leaders to bolster defenses of Rohan and Gondor and slow down the shadow military machine.  Gollum, Frodo, and Sam claim victory by destroying the ring!  It was 50/50, there were eight search tiles left to draw from, four of which would have corrupted the fellowship and given victory to the Shadow player.  Both games were awesome experiences.  It's on the list of a really awesome type of game that I don't get to play often: two-player, heavy, 3-4 hours (Twilight Struggle, Hammer of the Scots, Washington's War).

(3 plays, but 30+ plays of 1st edition as well)  Ultimately not too different from the first edition.  The adjustments and additions are good, not a fan of the subtractions... but no big deal.

Absolutely the best Lord of the Rings game for a couple of geeks that want to sink that ring in Mount Doom or wreak havoc with orcs and nazgul.  The game is assymetrical, so the Fellowship player is on an adventure to Mordor while the Shadow player is waging a risk-style wargame to destroy Middle Earth.  More than any other geek-fest this is the one I can't get enough of.

EXPECTED: I'm not all together excited to play this one. The theme seems to be there in spades but I'm concerned it's going to be another generic war-game underneath all the pretty make-up and hiked up skirt. Intriguing but I've been fooled before.

IN REALITY: "...FOR ROHAN!" I've never felt so much about losing an elf or dwarf like this before! "...You SHALL not PASS!" Perfectly applied pressure from a never ending horde. "...my preciousss." Sweat beading from the brow tension at Mt Doom while you struggle at every turn not to break and give in to the darkness. So I say to this game "...you had me at hello."

COMPONENT QUALITY: HIGH C'mon a duel board!!! AND tarot style cards!!!

REPLAY ABILITY: HIGH if you have the time but for this one I would make time.

I played my first game of WotR on 16 December 2012. I had been wanting to play this game for two years. The first game was a little rough - five hours and a lot of rules lookups, including some mistakes we made earlier on that we corrected later in the game. This may end up being a top five game, so I have given it a 9. I want to really dig in and play this game more. I'm already thinking about new strategies and that's a sure sign that it's going to be a top game for me. UPDATE: War of the Ring Collector's Edition is a '10'.

I love this game.  The only reason it's not in my top ten is that once I play it...I'm good for awhile.  I feel that playing all the time might ruin this for me, but it plays so well.  No expansions needed!  So many rules to remember, but man...so worth the investment.  Star Wars Rebellion is amazing and the only reason this got knocked down a peg

RATING: 6
I can appreciate why people love this game, but I personally was not overly impressed. I love the Lord of the Rings and the War of the Ring does a great job at trying to capture that in a game. However as a game goes, I did not enjoy playing as a the Shadow player. I felt that winning as Sauron felt mean and cruel, (probably within the theme of the game), but didn't make me feel clever. For the same part, when I lost as the Free Peoples player, I felt like I was beaten by unfair unexpected card powers, instead of wit. 

I'm okay with asymmetry in board games... in fact I love it. I enjoyed Star Wars: Rebellion, (although I got a little tied of it by the third game), but I enjoyed it because it gave me agency in the game. When playing the rebels, I felt responsible if a terrible event happen as I would have the chance to block it with a leader. War of the Ring doesn't give you that though. Too many of the event cards feel unblockable/unpredictable, which is not what you want for a 3 hour game.

Overall, I don't recommend this game, unless you love Lord of the Rings and the money to spare.

La primera partida me ha dejado un gusto agridulce, por un lado la presencia en mesa es imponente y la tematica me gusta, eso es muy importante en este juego ya que es muy tematico y si no te gusta El Señor de los Anillos, seguramente no te guste este juego.

Por otro lado, a mi me da la sensacion de que la presion en el juego y la toma de decisiones complejas la tienen Los Pueblos Libres, con apenas 4 dados iniciales debe:
* Mover a la comunidad con rapidez, ya que la distancia a recorrer hasta Mordor es grande, y si te duermes en los laureles, Sauron se hace cada vez con mas fuerzas y se vuelve casi imposible. Sauron ademas cada vez que mueve la comunidad hace una busqueda, lo que a el solo le supone una tirada de dados, vamos que no tiene nada que valorar, "¡Has movido!, pues tiro dados y a ver si te descubro y ganas puntos de corrupcion...."
* Debes avanzar en el marcador politico a los Pueblos Libres a la casilla En Guerra, lo que te hara gastar bastantes dados en los primeros turnos o tener que separar a la comunidad lo que tambien te lleva tiempo ya que hay que mover a los mienbros para activar las naciones..., y Sauron lo tiene mas facil teniendo menos naciones que desplazar y mas cerca de la casilla En Guerra, sus naciones no hay que activarlas, ademas de que empieza con 7 dados, mas posibilidades para avanzar el marcador politico.... Recordar que no puedes reclutar con los dados a no ser que la nacion esta en guerra por lo que Sauron se hara mas fuerte antes, seguro.
* Ademas de todo esto, deben Los Pueblos Libres fortalecer sus asentamientos moviendo tropas al principio ya que Sauron se hara mas fuerte antes por lo anteriormente citado y atacara los asentamientos para ganar puntos de victoria, que es la unica condicion de victoria que puede controlar ya que la corrupcion que se le genera a la comunidad es puro azar: tirada de dados, robo de loseta...
* Si ve algun asentamiento poco protegido de Sauron atacarlo lo antes posible ya que con cuatro puntos de victoria gana.

Por otro lado Sauron con 7 dados iniciales debe:
*Mover en el marcador politico de sus tres naciones (no las cinco de Los Pueblos Libres) que estan mas cerca de la casilla en guerra y activadas, para poder reclutar tropas cuanto antes.
* Valorar cuantos dados pone de los 7 en la casilla de busqueda de la comunidad.
*Reclutar tropas cuanto antes y realizar tantos ataques como pueda a los asentamientos puntuables de los pueblos libres por dos motivos, los puntos de victoria y que los pueblos libres pierden definitivamente sus tropas cuando pierden la batalla cosa que no pasa con las tropas de sauron, que se quedan disponibles para volver a reclutarlas.

Esto se traduce en que casi y sin casi, la unicas decisiones para Sauron son: Reclutar tropas, Atacar asentamientos, Defender sus asentamientos.
Los Pueblos Libres tienen que: Mover la Comunidad, emplear varios turnos en movilizar naciones y activarlas en el marcador politico, Defender los asentamientos,Reclutar tropas y Atacar si hay asentamientos puntuables de Sauron desprotegidos.

Por todo ello veo que en principio Los pueblos Libres lo tienen mas dificil que Sauron. El azar esta presente por las tiradas de dados.

La valoracion seria algo mas baja de no ser por la produccion del juego, espero valorarlo mejor en fururas partidas...

I've only played this once, but the LotR nerd in me is always willing to play.

An elegant and beautifully realized war game set in an imaginary world that seems as real as the European theater of WWII.  This design successfully  captures the novel because it recognizes the actual strengths and weaknesses of each side, allowing the narrative to shine. You MUST know your enemy to win this game.  This is a balanced,  tense contest, often coming down to a few final card plays and rolls. The game  will demand your attention as you learn the system, but   will deliver on the time invested. WOTR is a contest of  epic proportions and a definitive classic in its genre;this coming from a player who swore he'd never play anything but history-based games.  Johnny Come Lately is sold!

I love this game.  Amazingly thematic experience brought about by the Ring bearer's quest amidst the Free People's desperate defense against Sauron's aggressive match to conquer Middle-Earth. There is plenty of leeway to adjust your strategies and tactics to multitude of circumstances that may develop as a result

The combat system does seems too simplistic but works as well to keep the complexity of the game manageable

Have actually only played the first edition, but about what I read regarding the second edition, the changes mainly affect balancing for more competitive gamers. I am positive that I would come to the same assesment as for the first edition (rated 8.5):

[i]This is certainly one of best thematic games. The miniatures, the map and the artwork on the cards are gorgeous. After one (and a half) plays it seems as there are a lot of strategies to try out. The Mordor player is certainly creating the game (is he giving the fellowship opportunities to advance; does he attack Gondor, Rohan or the Elves?), while the fellowship player rather reacts to this. 

In general I am not a big fan of reading a bunch of cards in each turn. But here I can overlook this easily, since the cards really offer a lot of different possibilities and increase the thematic flair of the game. The only down side I see so far for this game is the very long setup time and the rules. The rule book is well written, but there are just a lot of rules to remember (especially regarding politics) and you will have to take a look in the rule book several times during first play.[/i]

Owned since February 7, 2015.
Also owned the Lords of Middle-Earth and Treebeard expansions.
As of March 7, 2015; I had 4 plays.
1 play with LoME.

Pros:
- Flawless Middle-Earth theme.
- Tactical gameplay.
- Clever dice mechanics force you to utilize your options.
- A gigantic board.
- Gigantic cards.
- Finely-sculpted beautiful plastic figures.
- The dice make sure that no game will be exactly the same.

Cons:
- There are so many rules, and the ones about the Fellowship are simply confusing. Hard to introduce to new players.
- Unfortunately, the clever dice mechanics aren't that clever. It makes for a half tactical and half luck-based gameplay that can get frustrating.
- Combat also involves a lot of luck.

Final verdict:
Tolkien fans like me will love this game and want to play it repeatedly. Don't let the cons confuse you; despite the game involving a lot of luck, the more you play the more you'll know how to get around it. And that's what makes this game beautiful. Consider getting the expansions as well.
If you don't even know what Middle-Earth is, you might want to pass.

RATING: 10
While there is a long list of board games I enjoy, none stand out more than War of the Ring (WOTR). After fifteen plays, the popular war-themed, two-player game continues to provide exciting adventures.

WOTR is designed to appeal to two groups: advanced board gamers and Lord of the Rings fans. Others may find themselves in over their heads or uninterested in the theme.


COMPONENTS

After opening the box, you might be somewhat overwhelmed by the miniatures. Between the two armies, there are 205 plastic minis with 34 detailed and unique models. Having so many pieces, organization can be an issue, and the insert that comes with the game only contains two large bins for the minis. However, you can easily solve this issue with a few Plano boxes. 

In the game, troops from the five Free Peoples nations are all represented by blue minis.  Likewise, the three Shadow nations all have red minis. This lack of color variety can make it difficult to identify which nation a mini belongs to. But, if you’re artistic, this presents an opportunity for customization by painting them!

WOTR’s board is large, preventing regions from becoming overly crowded. Event cards are tarot sized, which improves readability. Other components, including dice and cardboard tokens, are fairly standard.


GAMEPLAY

WOTR’s publisher, Ares Games, manages to make a complex game play smoothly without sacrificing strategic depth. This accomplishment is largely due to its action dice. Each turn, your dice roll will limit your choice of actions, minimizing the seemingly endless options available. 

Asymmetric gameplay makes it essential to understand the basic strategy associated with the Free Peoples player and the Shadow player. Both have different objectives and slightly different rules, which certainly introduces a steep learning curve to WOTR. However, if you decide to invest the time, you will be rewarded with a plethora of strategic variations.


THEME

If you’re a Lord of the Rings fan, you’ll certainly appreciate the game board, which is a faithful rendering of Tolkien’s map of Middle Earth. Character cards and the box are also covered with thematic artwork. All aspects of this game point towards the theme. This is especially true of the gameplay, which often follows the plot of Tolkien’s novels.


Overall, WOTR would make a valuable addition to your board game collection. It’s certainly a time investment to learn and to play, but, within its well-crafted components, deep strategy, and rich theme, you are sure to find a rewarding gaming experience.

05-06-2014. Played War of the Ring 3 times. Once 1st edition, two times using BGG user Fillem's 2nd edition copy. I like 2nd edition better due to the bigger cards and more clear VP marker for the settlements.

I adore this game. There is so much to do, and so many interesting things to do. The way that you roll action dice to determine your action pool for the round is really fun. It means that you have to make the best of the actions given to you. You can buy new troops, move troops, move nations closer to war or move the fellowship. Sauron can hunt the fellowship. Quite like the books :).

The game looks incredible. The game is incredibly thematic, reflecting the books/movies pretty accurately. Sauron starts of incredibly strong and when he unleashes his attack on ME, you're powerless to stop him. Luckily, free peoples players do not have to get Sauron's 10 VPs from military, but just 4 before they win :). Also fun, Sauron has unlimited guys, but the free people's run out and dead units are not replaced, leading to the feeling that Sauron's resources are endless, while you are dwindling. Very nicely implemented.

One nitpick, they could have used different colored plastics for each faction. Different shades of blue for example would have helped differentiating factions to facilitate set-up and would've helped gameplay/strategy as well. I have at times mis-remembered guys or advanced the wrong army because I misidentified the armies.

Yes, the game is long: I suspect around 3 hours per game. However, time flies for me when playing WotR.

A beautiful game in its graphical presentation and component quality, as well as in its design and gameplay execution. No other game so perfectly blends game elements and mechanisms with the source material theme.

I love the Lord of the Rings, and this game really makes you feel like you're playing out your given role from the story. I've recently colored the bases with Sharpies, so I'm looking forward to playing again soon.

What keeps this from a 10 is mostly that there's a heavy luck element to it: dice rolling, card draws, drawing tiles from the bag... Since there's lots of this, it tends to even out over time, but a 3 hour game can ultimately come down to a 50/50 chance of drawing the right tile from the bag. Also, it has a very long setup time and can only be played with two players, so it doesn't get to the table much, but it's a great game when I'm able to play it.

Unarguably one of the best games ever played. Only a couple of problems:

Bought new from CSI. Finally got this one to the table.  LotR is by far my favorite IP so it's no surprise that I absolutely love this game.  I played a horrible first game and lost early, but I could have fun just setting this up and looking at it.  Great card play that directs your actions and lots of options to work towards your victory conditions.  I'll be saving up to buy an anniversary edition in the future.

[thread=738666]Rule differences from 1ed here.[/thread] 

Minimal changes to 1ed rules for game-balance purposes, and to weed out some 'weird' strategies that bend the rules. I find that they do help, but it can still be swing-y for the FP, basically equating to whether and how long you can maintain 6 action dice for. I'd say the balance (and this looked in line with the ladder last I checked) is probably like 52-48 Shadow now (as opposed to 55-45).

Also, the Mordor declaration and 1-Eye requirement reek of 'artificial' house rules, and don't feel very natural.

Finally got to play this epic and all I can say is it was fantastic.  Totally enjoyed every aspect of it.  The way the mechanics interact with each other is sweet.  Strongholds work great and I can see myself playing this more in the future.  The only drawback is that it can take a really long time to play, especially when both players are new/learning.  Even with that, I can see that going down with additional plays.  Excellent stuff!

Well, a 2nd play of this bumps it up to a 10 for me.  It's not just a game, it's an experience and an emotional ride from start to finish.  Great stuff!

This game could benefit from a quick-start tutorial. After setting it up the first time, it would be nice to be able to start playing it immediately without having to pause to read through about 25 pages of remaining instructions, or else find and watch an hours long how-to video. Moreover, it would be nice if there was a quick-start tutorial for this game so that you have an easier way to introduce others to War of the Ring. As it stands, because of setting up and then learning how to play,  you probably wont get a chance to fit a game of this in on the same day that you first bring it home. Additionally, the first game that you play against anyone whom you have to explain this game to extemporaneously, probably wont be an incredibly fun introduction to this board game, because it will be very slow. The only alternative would be to convince a newcomer opponent to read through nearly 30 pages of rules and/or watch a few hours worth of how-to videos, first. Yet, that's where what is bad about this game ends.

1 Partial game with Friends copy.  He mainly watched vids so we didn't really have a good idea what was going on and constantly were referencing the rules on every play.

By the end we figured a bunch of stuff out but it was getting late for him and we didn't finish.  Since then I have looked at rules and some videos and think I get the game just fine now.  Should go much more smoothly next time.

Regardless of just a partial game I am hopeful.  One thing for sure the theme meshes with the mechanics pretty amazingly with the ringbearers movement/being found/having to hide again.  Characters moving around and what they do to the game.  Seems very well designed and I am hopeful this will be a favorite game.  If I can get my wife to play (maybe the java client first) hopefully she will like it enough due to theme to justify getting a copy for myself.

The extent of the changes does not seem to justify the marketing operation surrounding this version (in particular, the dedicated BGG entry seems silly to me). Still, an upgrade kit was offered, and this edition does fine-tune the balance of an already outstanding game.

In a sense, the minimal changes that went to fix balance issues testify to how good and solid this design is.

[b]Best Epic Game Award[/b]

I love two player games. I love epic games. I love games with diverse strategies and multiple paths to victory. I love games with random elements such as cards or die rolls to change the experience every time and add a dash of drama and unpredicitability. I love beautiful games that take pride in their components. And most of all, I love highly asymmetric games. 

We have a winner!

[b]P.S.[/b] If you want a great example of how you can take a setting and a theme and build a game around it, and not only have every facet of the gameplay remind you of that setting and theme, while still achieving masterful gameplay that actually stands completely on its own... start here. There's no give-and-take or compromise, this is both the most thematic game and perhaps the best game (depending on what metric I'm using) that I've ever played

Comments from plays of 1st edition:

Mar 2005: Haven't played a full game - just got a demo (very poorly run!) at GenCon '04. While it has some interesting mechanics - the race to destroy the ring, the Shadow's search for the fellowship - it seems to be too much of a wargame for me. There are just way too many little pieces on the board. Plus, each country is so small that the hordes don't easily fit (and the "solution" of using chits isn't very good)! It may be better as a 2-player game. We played with 4, and had a hard time figuring out which armies belonged to each player. Why use such ugly colors? Why make every good/evil piece the same color? Couldn't Saruman/Sauron and Rohan/Gondor/etc be, at the very least, different shades to facilitate 4-player games?

4/10

Sep 2011: 2er, full game, with someone who knows the rules.
MUCH better! The physical production is still a bit iffy -- pieces don't fit in regions, Nazgul are top heavy and need pennies glued to the bottoms to keep them standing, etc. -- but the game play is greatly improved playing this as a 2-player game. Gameplay is very evocative of the theme and story. And there are some very cool mechanisms here: 
- the dice-driven action selection narrow the scope of what you can do, which is good for a non-wargamer!, but _should_ average out over time
- the search for the Fellowship by reducing your dice pool ... very nice! In fact I like pretty much everything about how the Fellowship is handled: it must break over time, as people are forced to split off to do things; terrific semi-hidden movement system that is both simple and effective in hiding exact location without becoming cumbersome; how Sauron catches glimpses as they move, are found, then hide again.
- event cards and dice sort of remind me of card-driven (war)games like Twilight Struggle, which BTW is an awesome game!
- combat is tough! Clever to have Sauron's forces unlimited, but have the Free Peoples succumb to attrition through the game.
- pretty simple turn structure, really, for such an involved game
- the final push up Mount Doom to destroy the ring is appropriately tense!

I'm not sure how much I will like it in the long run, though: there are an awful lot of dice rolling here and I tend not to like those types of games. And the game is somewhat long, although that isn't necessarily a problem for me. But looking forward to trying it again!
7/10?

This game is like living the movies! We went through Moria to Lorien, Defended against Isengard in Helmsdeep, The ents attacked Isengard and Aragon led a folly charge on the black gate that ultimately won the free player the game!

The game is very deep and has multiple facets. You are always interacting with the other player which I really like (Why play a board game if there is no interaction)! It takes a lot of time though and can be too complex for the player looking for a shorter game.

I enjoy Tolkien lore, and [i]really[/i] loved the LOTR trilogy when I read them as a child. This is a great implementation of the war aspect of the story balanced with the journey of the fellowship itself. 

The action dice provide interesting and unique challenges, as you might not be able to pursue your goals based on what actions are available to you.  The cards are also interesting, as they are dual-use -- you either use them for their combat or non-combat abilities. I find the game to have an abundance of interesting choices and I'm always fully engaged while playing.

Thematically, the game just nails it. The shadow player grows in military might and [i]should[/i] be conquering more and more regions as the game progresses. As the free people, you’re trying to delay the ever-growing tide, look for opportunities to strike back with you military (or just pose a threat to certain regions) all the while balancing the need to move the fellowship forward without getting too much corruption.

I just [i]love[/i] this game and it’s one of my favourites of all time. The only thing preventing me from playing it more is the 2 player restriction (yeah, it “plays” with 4…if you share turns) and the fact that it usually takes a good 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours to play. At this point in my life, those factors make it more difficult to get to the table.

Woah, you better be a huge LOTR fan, and even more important, a fan of long war games. While I can on board with the LOTR stuff, the length and especially the intensive learning curve: we played for 3 hours and had hardly moved along at all. You have to look up everything, some people online say you should just keep going, you don't need to understand everything but I found it hard to make any decisions if I don't know what is going and what are the consequences.
But even if I could muster up the patience to learn this, I don't think I would like it. The dice combat system is bad, it is not better than your outdated Risk combat and that is at least quick. It seemed as if no matter what you strategized and cards you played, the dice just decide and anything else doesn't matter. I hate that mechanic. And when you pair with endless lengthiness that boils down to whether you can roll a 5 or a 6, I am a bit pissed to be honest.
Additionally, the looks of the game are a bit disappointing. Lots of minions and a cool map board but I have seen better looking games, and similar games that pull of a better design.
I know, there is love for this game but I feel that comes from a very specific type of gamer (love theme? love immersion? want to get lost in LOTR for hours and more hours while you occasional roll battle dice?) and I am not that type.

I haven't played enough games to determine its true balance, but from what I've experienced, this game is the real deal, especially for Lord of the Rings fans. I don't know how enjoyable it would be for non-fans, but this is essentially the books and movies in a box. Extremely thematic, awesome game that usually feels very close. The rules are heavy though, so the first game or two will take a while. I don't know that we're playing every rule correctly, but after the first few games you shouldn't need to refer to the rule book too often. Moves very smoothly once you know how to play. 10/10 very balanced, strategic, thematic. MUST have for any Lord of the Rings fan.

Big, bold, clever, complex. Everything you've heard about it is true, so if you're heavy into Tolkien, don't hesitate unless the rules and game weight are just too much for you.  Be prepared for big-time strategy--those cards offer lots of options and require lots of puzzling out to play well. Also a bit of a barrier is the overly subtle graphic design, which should have less experienced players baffled about which armies are which, among other smaller oblique details which make everything from the dice to the board icons tough to decipher. I finally ditched the clunky miniatures entirely in favor of homemade counters.

This is a VERY nice game. It does a great job recreating the feeling and atmosphere of the fantastic books.

On the downside, we have not yet been able to play it under 4 hours, and the colours of the pieces could have been, well, much nicer... But still, I really do recommend this one!

Rating based on a single play. I'm not usually a fan of two player games, so take that for what you will. It was decent and definitely not a bad game -- but the limited actions based on dice and the sheer number of things going on make it very convoluted.

If there was no theme here I'm sure people rating it would give it a much, much lower rating. My rating is based on the idea of just the game mechanisms and not taking into account the theme.

I would give it a 10, but the fact that a game can sometimes drag on beyond 3 hours is a slight negative.  Especially if your the SA and your poised to win it all and all you throw are planters and musters.  It can get a little bit frustrating after 3 hours if you can't just go all out attack.
But The thematics of the game alongside the narrative of the story blend brilliantly together, plus every game tends to be a nail-biter right at the end, no matter who gets a head start, or so it seems.

RATING: 8
5.5 hours including setup and rules learning. The components are great except that the miniatures aren't color coded which makes sorting and identifying them a real pain. And the nation symbols on the war track are blazingly hard to identify. 

The game itself seems solid with plenty of choices and though the Risk variant complaints do have a ring of truth, there is still a good game here and enough variety to keep it interesting. Perhaps it does lean too heavily on the IP but as a casual wargamer I'll take that over a great game on a boring topic.

I felt that the game had quite a lot of automatic balancing built into it which prevented one side completely outdoing the other. The downside being that at times bad luck in the dice can often make you feel like you're just along for the ride. I'm not sure that it's such a bad thing though. After a few plays the gameplay which is fairly simple should move out of the way and the players can focus on the story and card play making the game come to life.

The Fellowship had wonderful luck in the game, that is to say the Shadow couldn't roll kill a hobbits life and with some decent card draws was not revealed until about half way across the board. To make matters worse SP was initially only moving a single army instead of two which meant his forces took too long to build up and were rebuffed from Helm's Deep, though the shire and surrounds were all sacked. In his favour though the lack of action meant that the FP took forever to bring anyone to War status effectively killing off any chance of a military victory and keeping most of the Fellowship together so they couldn't interfere elsewhere

It ended as one would expect with a ring dunk to 7VP. A veritable thrashing in WotR terms. 

Twas nothing but a flesh wound.

8/10 is probably generous at this stage but I think the experience will improve to match it with further play.

This first play encouraged me enough to order the Lords of the Middle Earth expansion now, since it's OOP and I don't want to be left waiting for Ares to get around to it in six(?) months when it will be unavailable.

--
The Treebeard mini-expansion was fine. It didn't do much for my opponent but I suppose that it is a nice option to have for the rare case when it is useful.

Like rebellion, which I rave about, this game captures its intended theme/mechanics perfectly.  Since this game came much before Rebellion, I feel like Rebellion copied some ideas from this game, which should give you an idea just how much I like it.

The game literally is Lord of the Rings in a box.  It has everything from rings of power, to every major nation, to politics, the one ring, frodo/sam, corruption, the fellowship, nazgul, gandalf the white, sauromon, sauron, the witch king, story references like the Ents in Fangorn and more.

Ultimately the game is really like two games in a box.  

One is a complex game of Risk like strategy where you are moving around armies, getting them politically engaged to become at war, and trying to capture cities and strongholds. 

The second is the ring and the corruption of the fellowship where the shadow player spends some of his/her effort to hunting down the fellowship while the free peoples player tries to guide the fellowship into mordor and destroy the ring.  During this process, the game even forces and entices the player to split the fellowship to use them to perform other actions to help the fellowship from afar and join into the Risk like battle going on.  

The ring/corruption objectives are a great counter to the complex strategy of the war mechanics as they add heavy press your luck elements, seen mostly in lighter games.  It is a great way for a player who is doing poorly in combat to donate more effort into and still try to achieve victory.

I absolutely love this game.  My biggest gripe is that there are tons of figures, and it is HORRIBLY difficult to tell between nations of the free people, their figures all look the same.  Additionally, it is really quite complex and heavy.  This isn't a game you can quickly jump into, however, should you have 7-10 hours to drop this is an amazing game to pull out.

The only bad thing I can say about this game is just how long the playtime is, it is insane and could take 12 hours or more to finish.  Still, though it deserves a 10 it is just that good.

3/16/2017: Played it for the firs time. There are just so many rules in the game that I might need to clarify. The game has a very steep learning curve. Playing this game really feels like you are creating your own Lord of the Ring story out of each game and you can tell a story on how the winner won the game. Aside from the steep learning curve, the game also plays for 4 hours which is a bit long for a game. It took us quite a bit of time to read through the Event cards and understand how each one of them bends the rule. Having said that, I definitely going to get this game to the table again and hopefully play the game with the right rule this time around in shorter amount of time. :)

Every time I play I love this game more.  The LotR theme oozes from every card, the asymmetric game play is perfectly balanced, and while the dice rolling adds an element of luck to the game the way you spend your action dice is immensely strategic.  Hands down the best 2 player board game I have played.

Really a great game.  It feels like reading the book, or watching the movies, but not so scripted that you don't feel like you're calling the shots.  This game is very heavy in complexity though so it's tough to get through the rules, and really time consuming.  Especially on the first play through.  I would probably mark this a 10 if it weren't for the length making it difficult to get it out often.

RATING: 7
What a game! So much is going on, so many things to consider.

My only issue is the length. Not just that it is a long game, but the way that it is a long game. When attacking, you usually only hit on a 5 or a 6, and if someone retreats into a stronghold (which they will do often), it is even harder to successfully attack. This means that most battles feel unwinnable and the game would be much shorter if it weren't for this one issue. I've only played once so far, so hopefully this will improve with more plays.

That issue aside, the gameplay is pretty unique and has an epic feel because of all of the different armies and Frodo's quest to secretly enter Mordor.

Update: Could never really get this to the table because of the play time and complexity. I also picked up The Battle of Five Armies which I think I can actually get people to play and gives a similar feel.

Sold.

1/8/12 - I bought this on a whim because I didn't want to miss out on the second edition--even if it means I won't play it for a long while. At this point I plan to paint the bases or spray paint the different armies. I'm not painter, so even the basic job like that is going to be a huge task for me.

I DID IT! After months of having all the minis on my desk and on my chest-of-drawers, I finally finished my paint job. It was a huge task, as expected. I did a basic paint job to all the bases for easy nation recognition. But I kept the red/blue colors to keep the bad/good recognition quick too. I did a dip with Army Painter dip and they look fantastic. But for the special characters, I did a full-detail paint job and I'm quite happy with the results.

Now if only I could get it to the table more regularly.

This may well be my favourite game - Like Twilight Imperium, you come away from the game with unique stories and a sense of drama.

This is my favorite medium level war game. The theme and mechanics lend to some lovely "what if" scenarios between the free peoples and shadow players. Additionally, sides have slightly asymmetrical powers which really seem to give the game a satisfying sense of flow.

My favorite part is how there are essentially two different games, one involving moving Frodo and the fellowship towards mount doom, the other representing the military endeavors each player.

Ever since I started playing games, I have always gravitated towards the games that have strong theme. Well, this bad boy has been ranked as the #1 thematic game for a while (as of July 2015). What an experience! The theme and the game is fantastic! The game pits the forces loyal to Sauron against the free peoples of Middle Earth. The free peoples must decide whether to allocate their resources to the fellowship or towards the military of the different nations. They must decide if the companions of the fellowship are better served accompanying Frodo and Sam, or off rallying and supporting the troops of the free people. Sauron must decide if he will strengthen his armies to destroy the cities and strongholds of the free people, or focus on finding the ring and corrupting its bearer. The game is balanced on a knife edge, and is just excellent. And the story! It is really neat to re-write the Lord of the rings as you want to tell it. All the same places are there, all the characters are there, but the story is yours. Want to take the fellowship North to Erebor? Go for it! Want to have Gimli carry the ring bearers up the side of Mount Doom? Go for it. The game lets you tell the story, and it is a very good story indeed.

RATING: 10
Second edition makes very minor technical and aesthetic improvements on the already brilliant original. For a card driven game it doesn't suffer too much from "memorize the deck or else!" syndrome--as long as you tell new players about a few key cards "don't leave Saruman alone if the ents are out!" "there is a card in here that lets an army with a leader move two spaces!" you should be fine. Probably the most flavorful LOTR game I've played, and being the LOTR fan I am that is enough to move it to my top game list. The main negative I can think of is that the dice pool is so small that a few bad rolls of the action dice can screw you at times, which can be a problem since the entire game is built around the action dice.

This was the first play of what can only be described as an epic LoTR encounter - at nearly seven hours - although there were three newbies involved. There are a lot of nuances in this game and this was not helped by the inconsistent definitions of key words such as 'friendly' with what is referenced in the main rules. Overall, I'd play again, although it is difficult to manage the journey of the Fellowship towards Mount Doom with the field armies that the Shadow players may draw on. They have fewer leaders, given the armies they have, and unlike the Free Peoples, they are without limit and maybe recycled. A distinct advantage.

Love it. Nice multi-layered game with lots of decisions and dilemmas. My only complaint is that sometimes you can be overloaded by all the cards that are played "on the table" and you often over look something because of that (or at least I do).  

Other than that, it is an outstanding game, and captures all of the mood of the books/movies while at the same time managing to be a great strategy game too.

Also, I painted the base of my figures to make them easier to see which faction/nation they belong to. It sounds like many other people did the same -- it would be nice if a third edition did something like this (had different color figure bases to match the nation), for a little more money on the price of course.

Pretty epic game though there are a lot of rules to keep track, so not completely sure we played it right. Playing as the Free Peoples is pretty difficult, and it's easy for the Shadow to completely steamroll them.

Also, the white battle dice that come with the game suck so I replaced them with 1 set of 5 blue and 1 set of 5 red.

[size=18][b]WOW! WOW! WOW![/b][/size] Way better quality and presentation than I was expecting on the Anniversary Edition.  Short of the wooden box I'd say this one is even nicer than the WotR:CE version.  Worth the wait, and well worth the money.  The outer box is hard fabric covered material that opens out much like the CE version does.  The trays are separated with heavy poster board graphics that show everything that's in the given tray on the back side.  The compendium is excellent and separate from the rule book, and both are hard cover that come in their own separate case.  I'm very happy with it. :thumbsup::thumbsup::thumbsup:

Outstanding. Epic spectacle full of tension and excitement. This really is Lord of the Rings in a box. The scale of this game and the story it tells are amazing. Yes, it has a significant luck factor and there's a ton of dice chucking, but War of the Ring somehow manages to make it fun. Everything just works as it's glued together by this fantastic theme - chaos and randomness are just a part of the narrative.   

I've painted all the minis in their respective nation colours, added a black leather bag for the hunt tokens and upgraded all six-sided dice. It really facilitated and improved the whole gameplay. I've also painted the custom made 3D model of Mount Doom to further enhance the look of the board.

Wow. What a game. It's lord of the rings in a box.

The rules are actually reasonably simple for a game of this scale. For big theme heavy war games I put this near the top of the list.

Not all the mechanics have aged as gracefully. Indeed combat in particular I think could use a rethink in a potential third edition.

However, the narrative this game tells is fantastic. If you aren't a Lord of the Rings nut I might say look elsewhere, but if you have even a passing fancy this game is fantastic.

**sold at auction** wasn't getting played.  Still a great game.

Really enjoyed this even though it's table time is going to be pretty limited. It captures the theme and the mechanics actually help with that instead of hindering it. The game even kind of follows what happens in the story, since certain things are bound to happen earlier than others. The gameplay is pretty solid but the weaving of theme is really what makes it great. The action dice and event card/combat card mechanics really stand out for me.

I'd love to play this whenever possible and could see it trimming down to 3 hours easily. Even with a few hiccups, rule checks, and setup we still played our first game in under 4 hours.

Possibly better than 1e, need to see how the 2e expansions shake out but it is definitely more streamlined than 1e + expansion.  Could be a significantly different game after the planned expansions.  Definitely like the components a lot more, for that alone it is worth the purchase.

-------
Update: 2e is definitely better than 1e plus expansions.  However, to be fair, the small tweaks can of course easily be added back to 1e.  I still like the components better!

If you are a huge Tolkien/LOTR fan, this game is a must have. The pros for this game is that it is extremely thematic and presents asymmetrical gameplay. Despite having asymmetrical gameplay the game offers a good balance regardless of what side you are playing. Another pro to include is that there is some sort of a luck element in certain parts of the game such as the battles and corruption. I like that planning well will not always give you an automatic victory but will give you a higher chance. The miniatures are well detailed as well as the art on the cards and board. Battle sequences are well thought especially with the addition of certain cards.

Some cons of this game include a very long setup, cleanup, no color difference in miniatures making it hard to distinguish certain pieces from afar(unless painted), games can go for as long as 5 hours (not always a con) especially with expansions, and is harder to teach than the average board game especially to someone who is not familiar to LOTR or Tolkien.

Very enjoyable game. Good Ameritrash fun with lots of dice and card play. A bit heavy with a lot going on. If you love the theme then this is a must have epic game. If you don't particularily care or you already have a deep thematic two player strategy game then it isn't essential, due to the length and weight.

My first step upon getting this game has been to spray paint the miniatures in different colours to help differentiate the armies. I put some gold trim around the leader bases too. I look forward to playing but want to put a bit of time into making it more user friendly first.

First game of this edition was great, a 4 player epic that went down to the wire with either side having the chance to win right up to the end. A great thematic experience with some real strategic choices to make.

Features almost everything I want in a LoTR strategic-level wargame.

Far, far superior to LoTR:Risk, which this is a distant relative.

I'd have preferred [i]Galadriel[/i] and [i]Shelob[/i] to have more of a starring role, but at least they are included.

The Fellowship rules are a little tricky to get your head around, we have found. Also, the faction tokens are almost useless as a quick means of determining political stance, unless you've played the game many times - they are just all such obscure designs. Still, that's just whiny talk. This is a SUPERB game.

Oct 2012 UPDATE: [i]Lords of Middle-Earth[/i] solves the Galadriel issue, and promo Treebeard is a cool addition.

The favourite of my collection. Completely captures the feel of lord of the rings, and keeps you gripping to your chair until the very end.

I only wish I had time to play it more, but it typically ends up taking 5 hours a pop.

It is too complex for me, the rulebook is the worst I have seen. I am a fan of lord of the rings and I wanted to like it but it is too long, difficult to explain due to the rule book and too much text dependent, set up is painful and there is no difference among units types so for me is a no-sense war game. What I don't like is the cards that changes the rules and make it difficult to learn. However components are beautiful, it inmerse you in the Tolkien World. Defenitly a gamers' game. Too much time for what it delivers.

Un clásico de esos cuyo nombre hace enmudecer el auditorio, uno de los principales pilares de la fantasía, la épica y la diversión en el cosmos de los juegos de mesa. La Ilíada de los juegos de tablero y figuritas.

This is the perfect board game. PERFECTION. Every game plays out differently and if you like LOTR, this is the ONLY game you should own in that theme.

(first edition comments) Dripping with theme, and an interesting strategic situation. Not as much maneuvering as I'd maybe hoped (it's more of an efficiency game). It can be played in 2 hours, and feels satisfying.

Later edition: I liked the new Ent cards.

中土世界，正邪势力决战的再现，庞大的地图，数量众多的模型及魔戒电影小说剧情产生的共鸣，无一不是其加分之处。游戏中最另人印象深刻的就是对魔戒远征队的模拟，不移动是安全的，但是离胜利更远；移动是危险的，但没准就会永远失去同伴。魔戒圣战同时也是一个标准的战棋类游戏，甚至带有部分光荣之路的影子，相信玩过二者的会有同感。。。

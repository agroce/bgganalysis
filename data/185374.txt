Fast and fun, push your luck, there is some amount of screwage here once you're taking the action that has opponents reveal all their cards, but they can also benefit from that, so this one has some swing to it. The art is goofy and great.

I have many of these little filler games, and this one is one of the best. A very simple push your luck mechanism lies at the heart of this. We played this twice in about 20 minutes at the start of our game night. I was able to pull out wins in both games. This will go into the collection and I will trade out some other smallish games.

First of all, it only takes 10 minutes max, so it doesn't need to be the Best Game Ever to justify a play or two. What it does provide: fun with your friends. As simple as the actions are, there is something very rewarding about sneaking points past your friends, or flipping up their cards and catching them with monsters.

Interesting game of second guessing, bluffing and push your luck. First half of first play I was thinking it was thin and uneventful. Then I got it. It is a subtle bluff based on probability of the color backed cards.

Very well designed! Since the guardians give a different ability when caught with them. It helps determine when to push your luck or not.

Collect cards with varying degrees of risk until you decide to cash out for points (players race to 35 VP’s) or someone forces you to reveal your cards.  If you “bust” when forced to reveal, all points are lost and the accuser is rewarded with up to three special abilities.  If you succeed, you get the points (and the accuser wastes their turn with the accusation).    A solid push-your-luck filler that produces some laughs and paranoia.

My kids (ages 5 and 7) love this game. The closest comparison I can think of is Diamant/Incan Gold, which the kids also enjoy, but Loot n Run has sillier threats/monsters, has a bit of a bluffing element, and plays *much* quicker. Gamers may scoff that the luck of the draw plays a big role, and they'll be right, but that also helps level the playing field between kids and adults.

A fun little card gam. Small box with magnetic clasp. Easily transported.

If you can, grab the Vampires promo cards.

My 10 year-old says,"Its very fast and I won the first time I played it." (She wanted me to rate it a 10). I think it is fun and simple. Takes 5 minutes to teach and not much more to play. An enjoyable way to engage your kid for a bit (I can see it as a handy thing to have while waiting at airport gates). Not sure it will have a lot of stamina in terms of replay value, even for my kid. Time will tell. As always with Iello, the production of the simple components is top notch.

Update: Over a year after purchase my kids still ask to play. We often get in a quick game before they go off to bed at night. Well worth the very reasonable price at which you will find the game sold.

Simple little push your luck game with an aspect of bluffing. On your turn you either draw a card (have to do if you don't have one in front of you), score the cards you have in hand, or force someone else to reveal their cards. If their hand has greater monsters than amulets they are caught and they have to discard their hand. Additionally, for each of the 3 monster types (wolf, frankenstein, or mummy) they have a special ability goes off. A game any of the family can play and you can find some enjoyment out of as well.

Pretty dull game of temple exploring.
It plays quick but the option to call another player as an option to do on your turn is not balanced.

Nice entry into the push-your-luck genre, with nifty art.   There is a presence of bluffing - but would've been great to see that play more of a factor into the game.  It feels like you can play a good middle-of-the-road strategy of running every so often to move up the board without awakening.

A very creepy game with undead dolls. A horror game not for kids.
You play as one of the dolls and you also have an evil twin doll that you can play with, with the right spell card.
An older roll and move type game with a couple of interesting twists.
Moving is actually achieved by card draw.
The cards are humerus in that they provide you with advice that goes completely against what you should do.
For example, play with knives, walk under a ladder, and other gruesome advice that leads players to advance on the board.
If you cheat death or stop to smell the black roses you go back spaces instead.

Make no mistake this is a pretty graphic horror game and not a good one for children.
It has a graphic board with many undead dolls in all sorts of death situations, blood slicks, etc.
The cards are cartoon representations that are also graphic.

Other fun mechanics to the game are casting spells on other players and when you land on someones space you must have a battle with them.
You are considered an "intruder" if you land on someone elses space.

Awesome game! Fun and fast with some nice choices and tension. Push your luck with some reading/bluffing/messing with people.
Perfect game length.  Plays well from 2-6.  Really great!  Right up there with For Sale for a great light game.

I really have had a blast playing this game. I seem to be bad at guessing when to call people out. A great press your luck style game. I haven't played with more than 4 players. Doesn't seem like there's a lot of cards, but haven't run into a need to shuffle often, and enough cards that you can't really be tracking them. It also plays really quickly and doesn't suffer from down time for players if they run early while others continue to press on.

Fantastic push your luck game with just a little more to offer. Sure, there's a little left-right binding depending on where you sit but so what - play is so swift and short, just change up seating and play again. Don't play to win, play to create hilarity!

There are nowhere near enough status markers included. The rulebook has a number of grammatical errors (fairly unimportant I suppose) but also needs the errata from GMT to clarify routs, orderly withdrawals (very important) and other things. I am not sure I like so many towering stacks of status markers, feels like they obscure the units more than ASL. The one main game I played involving chariots seemed to be all about the dice rolls, not much room for tactical decisions, rather turgid and boring and various unrealistic things I don't like.  (Keeping as I like having the Troy scenario to look at.)

RATING: 7
GBoH with more emphasis on missile fire and maneuver than shock combat.  The rules are simpler than other titles (even simpler than RAN, though not by a lot), which means that most of the scenarios play in a couple of hours.  The chit draws make the game a bit wild, compared to something like Alex., but the resulting shorter playtime is worth it.

Scenarios played: Megiddo, Kadesh

Tentative rating of 8 - this may creep up.

Right now, I like it better than SPQR, but there are
so few scenarios in comparison I can't be certain about 
the jump.

Chit pull really works well for the game. I had real 
doubts, but it's good.

The masses of chariots running by shooting, and the
slow turning evident on the field is very pleasing.

RATING: 5
Highly complex simulation of the battles of the bronze age. If you haven´t played Great Battles of History before, the learning curve of this is massive! even after hours and hours of playing, we still found ourselves making mistakes.
It´s a good simulation and it´s interesting to understand how to use these chariots in combat.
But there are no relevant terrain features and the chariots are so superior over the other units, that the strong tendency toward the simulation aspect brings a lack of tension, strategic options and playability.
Still, I´m eager to try more of the series of another period.

Still playing my way through the battles...

To date, I would say this is a very interesting addition to the GBoH series. Not a bad one to start with either given the relative simple combat (particularly when not including chariots). The activations are via chit pull, a first for GBoH I believe. In addition, the routs are now to standards via the teleport method (a la the non-GBoH "Men of Iron") instead of a gradual drift off the map to the rear seen in other series games. I think that also simplifies things for the new player.

What it does share with its series siblings is that it, at its core, is a study in differing units and tactical systems. A good player will get a feel for the pros and cons of his cardboard troops; which are their Shock combat capabilities, effective means of deployment, tactical nuances, etc.. Missile fire comes from slingers, javelins and both self and composite bows. Shock emphasizes the moving attacker's advantages. The game also uses the intriguing period combination of light chariots paired with runner infantry. There are enough puzzles here to keep interested gamers entertained.

As with many tactical / grand tactical battle games, the narrative derived from the action is perhaps the greatest appeal for many. CoF certainly does not disappoint in this category. I suggest pairing the game with research via literature or the internet to further enhance this aspect of playing. Helps "set the mood".

More battles lie ahead, so with more experience my opinion may change.

Counters make for a lovely spectacle (especially Kadesh).  It is fun but the the sub-systems make for an intricate and occasionally tricky experience.  I am not convinced by the Rout rules where units teleport to their OC Standard to await later recovery.   In armies of this era I would expect routing forces to cause significant disruption to their unrouted comrades.  This sits awkwardly with the hit penalties for any kind of aggressive use of SI / HI.  The Scenario instructions are also messy and hard to digest.

RATING: 9
Part of the "Great Battles of History" series, focusing on the bronze age.

A terrific game to enter into the series, rules are really simple but figuring the best use of the chariots is quite a challenge, they come in different types and can also include runner infantry scorting them. Most of the battles come with large quantities of those wheeled contraptions, and much more smaller infantry quantities. It also comes with heroic combat rules, quite appropiate for those ancient times shrouded in myth.

Scenario selection is really complete, Sumer and Sekmem work as learning scenarios, one fro the combat per se, the other including more than one wing. Meggido and Kadesh are the "big battles" of the box and come with different variants. Astarpa, Nihriya, Senzar and Babylon are standard chariot clashes (there´s infantry), with free deployment of troops. Between them they manage to cover every variant on those clashes (2 man chariots vs 3 man chariots, with and without runner infantry...). The last scanario, Troy, is a showpiece for the heroic combat and is the most uinique battle in the box, with lots of shock and barbarian infantry, lots of heroes and only a token force of chariots. An amazing scenario to get loose with Achilles and company, it works really well and feels very Illiad-like.

If you want to get into GBOH series this is the first step. Plays fast (except the monster Kadesh), has very little errata, and is extremely fun.

I have played two scenarios. So far, this does not hold up to my other two GBoH titles: SPQR or Ceasar, Conquest of Gaul. I've gotten used to GBoH battles being epic, complex, interesting clashes of armies. The first two scenarios of this game are more like introductory scenarios to ease a player into the game. I guess that is OK, but I'm hoping the game gets better as I get further into the scenarios. Then I'll probably wish there were more epic battle scenarios. I'm downgrading this until I see more scenarios.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Detailed-but-fun, thought-provoking game on an unusual topic. My first GBOH foray and looking forward to playing more. 

The chariot mechanics, while not overly complex, took some getting used to. The designers contend chariots functioned primarily as mobile missile platforms and rarely intentionally engaged in close combat. “Orderly Withdrawal” and “Pass-Through” rules make chariots elusive to tie down in shock combat anyway. Specialized “Runner Infantry” (Bronze Age Panzer Grenadiers?) are chariots’ best friends on defense where the option to run away isn’t there. The best way to destroy chariots is by encirclement which, given their high mobility, is not easy to accomplish. With their ability to buzz each other, chariot vs. chariot combat is somewhat reminiscent of WW1 aerial combat, and one can imagine the furballs rising from the desert floor… 

Nine scenarios covering some legendary battles, with interesting tactical situations (and a few variants), provide plenty of gameplay.  There’s even “heroic challenge” rules for a couple scenarios (one of them is “Troy,” inspired by Homer’s poem).  Rulebook is above average; still found a few ambiguities.  Unpredictability of the chit-pull mechanic makes for a great solitaire experience.

I only played a few of the smaller scenarios, so impressions and rating are preliminary.

One of the better entries in the series to date, and a very nice package overall.  I love the box art. There is a nice mix of 9 battles here, ranging from the tiny (Sumer) to medium large (Kadesh). Not all of the battles feature chariots, but they are all bronze age battles. The Troy scenario in particular looks like a blast. 

Scenario balance overall isn't as good as, say, Tyrant (still a highpoint in the series for manageable, competitively balanced scenarios) but the ones presented here aren't particularly lop-sided, either, and they should work in a pinch for serious competitive play via the rout point bidding system.

Very pleasant surprise.  I harbored doubts about Bronze Age warfare in the GBoH system, but there are major changes in familiar GBoH rules on combat, activation, and leadership, and it works well.  Designers necessarily make decisions about points still subject to debate; it is a happy result when the resulting design presents a coherent vision of what may have happened.  (This is NOT a back-handed compliment.  It is praise.) I still have a lot to learn about how to use my Heavy Chariots.

I love all the GBoH games and this one is no exception.  It plays mostly like the other games in the series with a few small exceptions.  The rules were fairly easy to understand especially for someone with GBoH experience.  This game covered some of the first recorded battles like Kadesh.  This battle was fought between the Egyptians and the Hittites.  The title of the games says it all.  Chariots, chariots, and more chariots take part in the battle (some 2-man and some 3-man chariots)with a fun but historic twist.  Some of the chariots have runners; light infantry literally running beside chariots in an effort to protect them from other infantry.  If you like the period, chariots, and GBoH, you will love this one.

I love how each army has their own distinct counter art.  Looks so pretty all set up.  I found BGoH rules very difficult to learn.  Once I did understand it, it isn't that bad at all, but I think it was hard to understand why certain mechanics were done a certain way just by reading.  The whole concept of shock, shock checks and trumping especially.  Only after having the courage to set it up and throw the units together did it start to click after a couple plays.

Another episode of GBoH......I like the GBoH system in eneral and i have most of the games in the series.  So this one would not be left out either.  Chariot attacks are fast and ferious, at an intensity level higher than you might have expected.  The physical components of this game are gorgeous.  The maps are clean and functional.  Standard GMT style.  I look forward to play the many scenarios contained in this package.  Often times, the game gives you a sense of richness when you study the ancint tactics alongside the weapon matrix measuring their respective effectiveness.  This is the fun part of the system.  Always look at the matrix when you plan your tactics.

I was quite excited about this when it was first announced.  I have only a little play under my belt.  The game looks and feels good.

But ... it is fair to say it is behind Musket & Pike, SPQR and GBoA in my list of priorities for that style of game (which in turn are a bit behind Line of Battle and La Bataille).

Listening to an audio book version of The Iliad has me wanting to play the Troy scenario.

Playing this right now (using the SGBoH rules)....

I have so far played most scenarios and am really enjoying the battles and scenarios. So far, the Battle of Kadesh is the scenario I find most interesting.

Update:
I ended up playing all scenarios except Nihriya... some, like Megiddo and Kadesh, I played more than once. The Battle of Kadesh was by far my favourite as I enjoyed the complexity and the order of battle. 

Some aspects of the chariot warfare were confusing to me and the Battle of Troy was especially confusing since there are no wings or divisions as in other scenarios. Also, the Trojan leader counters have no names.

To summarize, I really enjoyed the game and found the rules and scenarios to be very interesting. I will play the Kadesh scenario again in the future.

It is rare battles indeed that get engrained in the subconscious of a society. This entry in the GBOH series contains arguably 2 such battles amongst the plethora of 9 Bronze-age engagements covered by this game. Meggido - that has shaped the concept of Armageddon and Troy - where you too can engage in man-on-man hero combat!

Warfare in this package has a very distinctive flavour plus the grandeur of the chariot age. Amongst the scenarios are some excellent scenarios on half-sized maps to lead you into the system gradually, with the majority of the scenarios being on a full-sized map. Worth the effort!

The game uses a chit pull system that provides good replayability.

I've just played Sumer [introductory] and Senzar scenarios, both with the SGBoH rules: My opponent and I were very pleased with the experience and we agreed to play again in the future.

Chariot warfare is quite different from Phalanx and Legions: Chariots and SI can pass through enemy chariots and this gives a very unusual, colorful and fluid play where Maneuver and Missile Fire are more important than Shock Combat!

I sold off most of my GBOH games as most of the battles were uneven and those that did make a good game got overplayed. I did buy this to see how it worked with chariots and to replace Day of the Chariot by ATO, which was over-complicated. Chariots of Fire have several scenarios, most of which can be played in a sitting, though again some are rather uneven. Usually there is a solid bunch of foot in the centre, but it is the chariots whirling around the wings that settle the matter in the usual GBOH fireworks display.

Working through the rules in a 2-player game. Several aspects may make this more of an 'experience' than a competitive game (ignoring play balance issues).

1) Although the chit-pull system adds tension and variety/replayability it also can outright make or break one army or the other. (I could be just playing as to put myself in bad situations.)

2) The Shock CRT has too much of a gradient. As with the above, replayability comes at the expense of predictibility (which may be historical but it takes the player almost out of the outcome).

3) The Shock CRT has steadily decreasing Atk/Def loss Ratios with increasing column strength but the actual losses are not completely smooth. Although relatively minor compared to the above, it could have easily been smoothed. (Atk losses jump 23% going from columns 2 to 3 while Def losses decrease 18% going from columns 10 to 11.)

4) Cohesion hit markers soon cover most of the units, not only obscuring the nice artwork on the counters but also making the intermingled unit types and even sides indistinguishable. At a minimum, hit markers should come in 2 colors. (As a concession to cost, each game in the GBOH series could have less-than-full sets of hit markers in that people that are into this system will have more than a single game.)

This suggests that this (overall) game model is best suited for solitaire play.

Where to start?

I really want to like this game and GBoH, I really do. I'm far more interested in ancient history than WWII (studied ancient languages in college), but this system is truly ridiculous and often doesn't model ancient warfare accurately. The rules often feel unfinished, poorly developed, barely playtested. Little to no concern with the ergonomics of play. The rules-writing is atrocious; replete with typos and sentences which seem to have been copypasta'd into one another. (e.g. "moves adjacent to of an enemy" or "cannot not Fire.")

And then there are some really process-heavy rules which exist only because other rules create issues. Essentially they applied clunky patches to the rules rather than refine the system as a whole in search of an elegant solution.

Compra obligada, no es un wargame, pero divierte como tal, mezcla la gestión de recursos con la lucha, dándole más importancia a los recursos y las construcciones de edificios, pero sin dejar atrás la lucha. Algo largo de jugar casi 3 horas fáciles si juegas con 5 jugadores. Poco azar. 
Divierte mucho, engancha más, eso si, terminas estresado de tanto pensar.
Para mi esta en mi top 3. Sabe mezclar luchas, autogestion de recursos, construcción, supremacias... reduce el azar, la torre le da un toque unico y compensado, ya que lo que el azar te quita la torre te lo devuelve. 
Puede tener un defecto y es el que quizas le falte algo más de luchas, aunque esto es por que para mi NO es un wargame. Y es bastante largo a 4 o 5 jugadores. Con lo que puedes terminar un poco saturado de tanto pensar estrategias. A pesar de la largura, se hecha en falta un año más en el juego, para cuadrar las estrategias.

Great game, don't try to play it like Risk because it won't be a good idea.  It might be dull but you have to focus on the buildings.  The armies are just tools to capture the buildings, territory is not necessarily a good thing - it doesn't get you more troops, gold or rice.

Too many orders to choose at the beginning of each turn.  Dungeon Lords does this sort of thing MUCH better for my taste.

That cube tower is awesome, though.  It should be in every game.  All of them.

one of my gf favourite, the tower is amazing for her a pain for me. If you play with the assigned provinces after a few plays it gets boring. Higest rating if it was meant for 2 players (instead of sun and moon side of the map they could have create a map for 2-players).

Anything Japanese and Oooozing quality I just gotta have. Also dying to compare it with the Total War (Japan) series, my favourite RTS ever. The Mongol expansion seemed to make a few fixes, which meant the game was less of a challenge. This was a shame as I loved getting my ass kicked, and made victory feel sweeter than with the expansions.

Part of me is tempted to bastardise this tower into a dice tower. I'm sure 11mm dice would stand a better chance. Maybe I could just trace the dimensions and make a clone & steal the towers pot whenever I need it.

I've played a bunch of Wallenstein on spielbyweb.com, but none of that prepared me for the glory of face-to-face Shogun. The bidding system, the new events, and the new map all add quite a bit to the game.

Throwing cubes into the real tower rather than the virtual tower is a wonderfully tactile step up. The more condensed playing time is also a huge plus.

RATING: 8.5
As expected, this game plays almost exactly the same as Wallenstein. In my opinion, there are two major differences: the bidding for starting position/player benefits and the layout of the board. Bidding for player position is a nice addition as it removes a random element from the game that I don't really feel adds to the game in Wallenstein. I like the board layout better in Wallenstein, though, since I feel that the elongated board of Shogun separates players later in the game somewhat.

This has to be one of my favorites. Two words: Battle Tower. Decision making with elements of incomplete information makes this a great game which balances the need for good decision making for both offense and defense. Wonderful artwork and gameplay working well together. A nice way to spend a gaming evening.

In Dirk Henn land, you don't play the game, THE GAME PLAYS YOU!

In this game you commit to taking ten actions, but don't really know what order you are going to take the last five of those actions. As a result you are playing more against the game, while trying to squeeze in some player interaction on the side.

The cube tower is a fun novelty and the only reason to play the game.

See also Wallenstein.

Shogun is a very cool game.  The cube tower works out very well to resolve battles, and also looks and feels super when it's being used.

I like how Shogun gives you certain actions and allows you to assign a territory you own to take that action.  Each season (game turn), you plan by assigning your cards and then resolve them in order.  The first half of this order is revealed when the cards are laid down, but the second half is hidden until just before it's resolved.  This gives you enough information to plan smart, but not enough where you'll get bogged down by AP and second-guessing.

Everybody needs to build stuff in their territories to score points, but they also need to protect their stuff with armies and/or strategically attack their opponents to steal their stuff.

And then there's rice.  You need to feed the people in your territories, and if you don't have enough they will revolt and potentially kick you out of the territory (wiping out anything that was built there).  Each year, there are 4 event-style cards that modify gameplay somehow, and each has a negative rice amount on it.  You're shown these at the beginning of the year, but then they're shuffled and come out one by one each season, so you're not quite sure what the rice penalty will be when winter comes.  This provides variation and an interesting planning component each season.

I like playing Shogun because battles are fun, planning is interesting, and there are always power struggles over limited terrain and valuable buildings.  It's a big game that plays in around 2 hours.

I like the fancy mechanics we've heard so much about - a truly impressive accomplishment. The combat tower works perfectly in speed and presentation. The rules are well worked and beautiful. However, it invites a terrible analysis paralysis problem - so be careful if you play with very thoughtful min/max type players. Perhaps a timer will help during the planning phase. Still, such a nice flow in this game. Once you 'get' the game system, it plays reasonably fast (although brace yourself for a few hours of play) and is highly engaging.

Juego de control de zonas, en el japón feudal, con muchos más factores, gestión, diplomacia, esta divertido, pero las posibles estrategias las tumba la suerte de la torre, no hay dados. Que hay que decir que el sistema de la torre es muy original, pero a efectos del juego, añade bastante azar que puede ser decisivo.

After one play:
A hybrid of a wargame and an eurogame. I was a bit sceptic about Shogun before I got to play it. The dynamics just work incredibly well. I especially like the revolting peasants and how they harass the players.

After several plays:
Still going strong. Not hitting the table as often as it used to but still won't turn down a game. Maybe one concern is how crucial the initial setup is to your future prospects.

I have only played Shogun with two players using a variant found from http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/134081. The game was boring and too much euro-game, but perhaps that will change when I get to try it with more players. It was a bit of a disappointment for me still.

I'm going to have to play this more often to get a really firm aspect on it.  However, it not too dissimilar to Wallenstein so I'll base these comments on that.

Strategy-wise, I prefer the turn bidding and special powers here to the sytem used in Wallenstein - it's something else to think about, which is good for most of us.  However, it does add to the game length, and the Wallenstein is pretty long anyway.  I don't prefer the Shogun event deck as although the one in Wallenstein was more random, it was also more edgy and variable.  I'm not sure where I am with the maps.  On the face of it, there are more corners to hide in (which is not a good thing) but there are also a few sneaky pathways via the sea-lanes (which is a good thing).  It seems to me that on the Sun map, it is advantageous to be in the corners - there's enough to attack from there and it's hard to be attacked.  On the Moon map, it's easier to attack anywhere and so I think the advantage of having more options from a central position means that's the place to be.

Great pseudo-wargame/development game -- gotta love the cube tower and the theme is a major draw for a Japanophile like myself.  It would get a higher rating if both of the sessions I've played (each with five people) didn't start at 9 PM and end sometime after 1 AM!

Update:  Now that I've visited Japan, the thematic appeal of this game has risen even higher for me.  I also find that no matter how well I *think* I am working out my strategy on each successive play, two things happen. 1. I always, always lose, typically coming in last.  2. Despite the fact that I always lose, I keep pulling the box out of the closet and insisting we play it!  Being able to say "I build the shinto shrine in Nara we visited," "I'm building Himeji Castle," "Edo, been there, done that," add a little thrill for me, but mostly I think it's those colorful, colorful cubes shooting around in secret inside that damnable tower that keeps pulling me back!  And so, my rating of Shogun rises again.  Hinode!

Shogun has a nifty cube tower that I find interesting (apart from when a cube gets stuck), a programming element that is a great brain burner and source of interesting surprises.

The game packs a lot of interesting choices and considerations, but is disserviced by excessive play time and tepid pacing, despite allowing concurrent programming.

I like the game, but can't get it played enough because the game does not grab my gaming partner's interest.

One of the 2 war based game I have bought so far.  Interesting concept as it makes use of the tower to determine who won the battles when conflict has arises.

Good points: Makes use of the tower to determine battle winnings which is innovative and usually exciting.  Interesting gameplay by placing the 5 action cards faced-up and the remaining 5 faced-down.  It allows both strategise planning and luck to win the game.

Bad points: If played with the simpler rules, which the inital land is division is pre-allocated with less than 5 (max) players.  The palyer next to neutral lands will be able to win easily which results in a certain amount of unfair play.

RATING: 8
You are all battling to become shogun, by taking the most land building the best collection of theatres, castles etc. and by defeating your opponents in battle.

It is a stand out because of its combat system whereby small wooden cubes of yours and your opponents colours are dropped into a treacherous "cube tower" and the victor is the one who has the most cubes come out of the bottom. This adds a great sense of newness to this game and can cause some major upsets since any cube that does not come out of the tower will stay there for next time, and may be dislodged later to fall out and assist a players later battles instead.

It also has a nest planning mechanic where you assign each of the turn actions to one of your provinces, meaning you do this blind at the beginning of the turn, not knowing whether other players will block your moves, or maybe take that province, making your order in there null and void!

Can get nasty obviously, but a neat and exciting game.

A great game of applied strategy with interesting mechanics; true to the historical background and context. This forces you deal with food shortages and rebellious uprisings, whilst battling it out 'Risk' style for area domination. The game therefore responds to your actions and strategic decisions, good or bad. I feel more than one game is required to truely get to grips with the various concepts involved. The dice tower is great fun; adding even greater elements of calculated risk and just pure fun!
I didn't pick up on certain strategic elements until late in the game, but thoroughly enjoyed all the aforementioned elements.

RATING: 8.98
Since Shogun has area control and simultaneous action selection, it was kinda inevitable that I loved it, in spite of what is (for me) an uninspiring theme (note to self: gotta give Wallenstein a try!). An extraordinarily tense game! The replayability value is immense, even without expansions. There are three things that keep me from giving it an outright 9, however:

1) It's an AP lover's dream.
2) It's slightly, just slightly, too long for what Shogun delivers (and I'm a fan of long games).
3) Shogun is a fiddly game, and the (at times) unclear rulebook doesn't help matters.

I can barely see the similarities to Risk which are mentioned here.

Shogun is practically a 10 for me. Shogun and Wallenstein are two of my favorite games (they are the same game). You can be shut out in both if a couple of things go south for you--which can be frustrating. But it's the nature of conflict in the game. 

I give Shogun 9/10 merely because adding the expansions give the extra edge into 'favorite game' territory for me. Wally 2ed gets the 10/10 since it includes expansions and I think the board is more balanced. But Shogun + expansions is 10/10 as well. I also like the Japanese theme a lot better than the German one, but eh.

Initial impressions after a 5 player game. Its an area control game with a unique combat system using a special dice tower. It has random setup using a simple 'pick between the 2' mechanic.

It is a simple game but it took us around 3 hours because of all this shuffling.

An euro war game with some clever mechanics and relatively straightforward and interesting decisions.  

You have effectively 6 rounds of action in the game, and two scoring rounds.  In each of the 6 action rounds, your have only 10 possible actions you can take, and in each round, you assign one of the territories under your control to one of those 10 actions.  Turn order is bid upon with slight bonus capabilities given for particular turn order choices, and there is a random event that applies to all players that round.  In addition, the ordering of the ten actions in each round is randomized and the ordering of the first five are known, with the remaining five sequentially being revealed as you step through the first five actions.  Scoring is based upon building three types of buildings, and having building type majorities in regions on the board.  Battles are resolved through the use of the funny cube tower.

All in all a very reasonable design, but in the final analysis, it just came up a bit meh for me. I almost thing the game would benefit with some house rules about "taking over" other people's buildings rather than simply destroying them when you enter the territory.  As war games of this type go, I would tend to prefer Game of Thrones or Diplomacy, though both of those are way too long to play!

I enjoy how Shogun plays, and while the cube tower is always interesting in theory it never feels as great in practice.

Wouldn't want to play this one more than occasionally.

Also, I love the unknown turn order system.  That really throws a nasty wrench in some plans, Especially late in the game if the gold gathering step is hidden.  

Highly recommended :)

RATING: 7
PROS:
-) Complex decisions from a relatively simple ruleset
-) Always torn between different things to do
-) The cube tower!
-) Some luck is involved, but not game-breaking

CONS:
-) Hard to see all the information you need at a glance (the provinces lack amount of chests/rice produced on the map, the cubes will often obscure the number of cities), which leads to confusion and frustrating mistakes.
-) The action cards laying on the player mats will easily shift and cause more confusion
-) Some kingmaking issues
-) A grave mistake early on can cost you the game. This in itself is not "bad", but it means you have to play along for 2+ hours without a real chance of winning (which gives a REAL incentive to become an active kingmaker)

Two words: Cube Tower
A great hybrid between a euro and war game. So good that even one of my group who dislikes directly confrontational games really enjoys (and does well at) it. Plays fast too, once everyone has allocated their provinces.

3/27/12 - I keep on saying I'm going to get this on the table, but really if there's a choice we always end up playing the original Wallenstein edition.  Knocked the rating down to a 7 because of this.

Re-themed Wallenstein, with a few minor changes.  I like bidding for turn sequence, but don't care for the board.  The colors are hard to read, and the board layout is longer and more spread out than Wallenstein.  I feel that the board (both sides) results in more combat per game than you see on the Wallenstein board.

RATING: 2
I really, really, really, really hate that tower, with its magical teleportation powers that can negate any strategy for distributing your army on the board. Far more random than any dice based combat mechanic, as at least in that case you can play the probabilities.

Otherwise it's actually a fairly decent game.

A game where the supposedly gimmicky mechanic (the tower) is actually an amazing and unbelievably funny part of the game. It's tactical with your strategies being destroyed by the battle system involving the tower. Not the deepest game, but not light either. A lot of fun.

I have played Shogun twice, and don't feel drawn to play it again.  I like the cube tower, the combat, the bits, etc.  What really hurts Shogun is the planning phase, which bogs down way too much.  There are a bunch of different decks to keep track of, and it seems like there's more time spent flipping cards to prepare the turn than playing the actual turn itself.  I was almost relieved when it came time to actually do something! 

Additionally, there's very little tension outside of using the cube tower, as only a few of the 10 actions taken every turn alter the board in a meaningful way.  If this game had a solid action order and got rid of about 3 decks of cards it would greatly improve.

Very interesting conquest game.  I like the way the battles work.  Battles in all conquest and war games are never very accurate (Trying to simulate people killing each other is just not the same as the real thing no matter what you do)  This game makes it quick and easy to do battle and there is no guarantee the outcome will be anything like either of you expect (As far as I'm concerned that is how war works)  I'm not a big fan of the set turn limit but other than that I like the game.

RATING: 3
The longest 5 hours of my life.  This is a game that whether you stand a chance of winning is heavily set at the beginning of the game by a chance drop of soldiers through a tower.  The game does not start with everyone on an even footing and is based more on the luck of placing the right 10 moves in advance along with the luck of the tower rather than real strategy.  You have only six turns the whole game that have to be designated in advance with too many random variables which keep it from being anything close to controlable.  If you have a player who can't make up their mind on their 10 moves (20-25 minutes to lay down their cards) the game will feel like an eternity.  Better suited for hard core war gamers that want to get into the euro boardgaming scene.  Bring something to read between down times.

RATING: 8
A great hybrid war-game and euro (that tilts more heavily to the euro side).  The robo-rally style action planning stuff feels a little out of place here but it's still fun.

As is often said, the game is more about building than destroying.  Aggression has to be thoughtful and precise.  Simply taking territory for its own sake wont get you very far.

all that plus managing unrest amongst the peasants! 

On the downside the game is quite long.  Especially with new players.  The rule book says you are supposed to play 2 years (in game time of course...not actual time), but in the past we've called it after 1.

What a game. As with my other 10 rated game (El Grande, I don't really count Space Crusade - see game comments for explanation) I knew from the moment I opened the massive box, read the rules and played with the tower (not in a pervy way) that this was a game that ticked all my gaming buttons. After two plays it lived up to my expectations and more. The only down side is that it's a brain burner and for my gaming group is pushing the amount of play time to the limit, so as with El Grande it won't hit the table as much as I'd wish. Oh hum.

RATING: 9
A leírás alapján sejtettem, hogy egy kiugróan jó játékkal lesz dolgunk. A játék igazolta a sejtést. Nagyon tetszik a csatákat eldöntő torony mechanizmusa, aminek hatására az egyes csaták nem tekinthetők egymástól független eseménynek, még a birodalom legtávolabbi csücskében sem. A torony ugyanis olyan különleges módon alakítja a szerencsefaktort, hogy ha valaki veszteséget szenved el, később nagy valószínűséggel kompenzálva lesz. Kivéve, ha nem valamelyik ellenféllel, hanem a földművesekkel gyűlik meg a baja, de ez csak rajta múlik. A torony az oka, hogy nem lehet tutira menni, és ész nélkül nekimenni az ellenfélnek, még nagy fölény esetén sem: egyrészt beleszólhatnak a parasztok, másrészt számít az is, korábban hogy szerepelt az ellenfél a csatákban. Előfordult olyan (bár ezt valaki biztosan hibaként rója fel), hogy 1 fős sereggel elfoglaltam egy tartományt, amit 6 fős sereg védett. 
A játék újrajátszhatóságát növeli a 2 féle térkép, és több olyan kártyafajta is, ami folyamatosan változó sorrendjével kihatással van az akciók sorrendjére (nagyon oda kell figyelni, hogy mindig minden kártya hatását figyelembe vegyük). 
Hátránya a játéknak, hogy nagyon elhúzódhat, ha túl sokat töprengenek a játékosok az eseményeik kiosztásán. Szerintem túl sok a 2 év, 4 fő esetén 320 akciót kell végrehajtani (a lázadásokkal együtt akár 100-nál több csata is lehet egy játékban, minden ilyen alkalommal a toronyba kell dobni az érintett seregeket). Nekünk ez 5 órába telt, a szabálymagyarázaton kívül. Amit még furcsálltam, bár nem feltétlen hiba, inkább csak érthetetlen számomra, hogy bár a körönként 10 akcióból csak 3 kapcsolatos közvetlen építkezésekkel, 5 (7?!) pedig hadászati művelet, mégis a játék végén döntően az épületekből szerezhető győzelni pont. Nagy dícséret a játékra nézve, hogy hibáival együtt is újabb játékért kiáltunk! 10 pontot a fentiek miatt nem adok, de nincs messze tőle még így se.
---
A 2. játék során egy fontos dolog kiderült: a fejenként 62 bábú (ajánlom megszámolni megvásárlás után) fontos szerephez juthat a középjátékban, mint korlát. Kettőnket is érintett a 4 fős játékban, emiatt nem tudtunk felhelyezni újabb egységeket. Ilyenkor nincs más választás: HARC...
---
Újabb játékokon vagyunk túl, mint kiderült, az első két játékban hibásan télen is akcióztunk, pedig az csak amolyan lezáró kör. Így a 3 akciókörrel azért annyira nem jellemző, hogy elfogyjon a 62 katona. 5 parti alapján egyértelműen kijelenthető, hogy középen nagyon nehéz nyerni!
Ki akarjuk még próbálni a gyári alapfelállást is, és a másik táblát, mert eddig mindegyiket azonos térképen játszottuk.
---
8 játékon vagyok túl. A játék továbbra is tetszik, de rá kellett jönnöm, hogy nagyon durva a szerencsefaktor, és nem elsősorban a toronyban, hanem pl. döntetlen licitnél, vagy a téli lázadásnál a lázadó tartományok kiválasztásánál. Emellett ami még hibának tekinthető, az az, hogy a tartományok kezdeti kiválasztása 90%-ban el is dönti a végeredményt (értsd: aki középen van, veszít)...

First Play: Jan-09-2008
I don't think I would play this game again.  The cube tower is very wonky.  It just doesn't make sense at all from a warfare standpoint.  With the cube tower, your odds of victory is not the same with the relative number of cubes you and your opponent throw in.  It is actually very counterintuitive.  You actually want to go to war in a different region first so that you can seed the cube tower, then go fight in the region that you actually care for.  The riots are counter-intuitive since they help you more often than hurt you, since you get to seed the cube tower for free.  Also, there is much more to be desired with the buildings.  The only difference between the buildings are points and the cost to build them.  Sure, the buildings get special abilities when they match the events, but you can't count on that.  90% of the time when you build those buildings, your motivation is only for points.  If you get extra perks, that' just icing on the cake.  So much detail, but in the end they do not really affect the game.  The events are very weak.  The bidding for turn order is not used at all.  The killing blow is that so little happens in the long game.  This game incorporates all the weaknesses of euros and multiplayer wargames.  Blech.

The game seems to be broken in that it may be already decided at the start of the game - if it happens that someone gets all of his provinces in one corner he's got huge advantage over the others and contrary if it happens that all of your provinces are scattered all over the map you're gonna lose, no matter what. Even if this problem had not existed the game still isn't very interesting.
edit:
in my second play we've played with the preset setup and the aforementioned problem was practically eliminated but still there's too much politics in this game to my liking, this is especially painful when your the victim of your too aggressive neighbour or what's worse - the coaltion of your neighbours. Such games are just not mu cup of tea.

One of my favorite games.  My appreciation of it grew after watching a documentary on the History Channel about Samurai.

Samurai battles were very random so this mechanic makes a lot of sense.

Played a 2 year season and really still love this game very much. Think a 5 player game would be better. There were only 4 players and 2 of them (myself included) were too conservative.

Lots of land emptied as people were wary of the need to feed the provinces. Realized that it was played incorrectly before as in after the 1st year the rebellion tokens were not removed but kept in play which were incorrect. Corrected this time round and it is much more enjoyable!

Finally got to try this one out.  While I really like elements and mechanics of the game, the game as a whole didn't get me too much.  I was kind of bummed when I realized the game only has six turns and two scoring rounds.  It is like the race is almost too short even though the playing time was extensive for those six turns.  It was a first time game for all four players so repeat plays may raise the rating as more of the learning curve is conquered.

First play greatly assisted by having played walenstein extensively before. The changes to the rules are all to the good. Bidding for turn order and the introduction of individual benifits are a great enhancement. The double sided board is also a really nice touch. Artwork is of a really excellent quality and my only critisism is aimed at the English rules which are downloaded from the publisher's website. Despite knowing the basic mechanics I still had to reread the rules 3 times to understand the changes from Wallenstein. Even then some rules are only explained in the examples. A lesson in how not to do it, but an excellent game none the less.

Ohhh my! So much fun on so many levels. The timing of the Actions are crucial to victory. I love how actions 6-10 are unknown so you can never fully plan out your turn to perfection. I had a couple of turns where I was hoping the money card came out sooner and ended up running out of chests. Also, the CUBE TOWER IS SO COOL!!!!! There were many tense moments in our game where the tower just wouldn't shoot out the right player's cubes. Also, the game feels epic in scope when it only took us about 2 hours to play. The only possible thing I would wish for would be a special power for each of the players. As it is, Shogun has been my favorite game of 2017 by far and is an easy 10 for me.

I really like the look of this game (especially the battle tower).  It is a good mix of area conquest a la RISK but to win it is necessary to build and control buildings that score the most points.  This game is fun with 4 or 5 because it is a little chaotic.  There is a lot of fun interaction.  Very well themed, I especially love that you need to fight off the peasants, this fits perfectly into the feel of the game.

For me this game is part of a game, i miss technologies. Without them the programing of your actions lacks purpose and excitement. The game system is solid, some streamlining could be added to lessen the "programing task" but overall a pleasant game. Personally though I rather play eclipse, through the ages, sid civ or any other game that have that civ feel rather than this. The game also runs to long for what it is. I also prefer in the year of the dragon that has more tension and more fun kind of programing in my opinion.

Wow. Was a little hesitante when had a chance of playing this at a local gaming group. The cover was a little questionable and did not want to play another long Risk -type board game. BUT this was totally worth it! Although it was long game (3,5 h with explanations) it kept me intrested right to the end. There were so many strange but great mechanics. 
To start of have to mention the dice tower: NOT THE TYPICAL were you drop dice at the top and the tower "shakes" it and drops it down at the bottom. No. Here instead of dice, you take the attacking and defending unit CUBES and drop it down at the top of the tower, but ONLY SOME make it to the bottom and some get jammed. And this at the bottom count and the jammed ones are left to probably influence upcoming battles. Although it is similar to dice roll it still feels that you are more in control with the every cube counts aspect. And when attacking another player you always have the uncertainty of how many armies did they already have stuck in the tower. Sure you mathy guys get a blast of counting.
Second is how you give orders. There is a grid given to each player and cards reprsenting each area you have on map plus some empty ones. In the grid there are 8 different orders that you can give to your units (attack, increase army, build building, gather reasources etc) In the beginning of every round players fill the grid with their cards thus giving an order to a certain area. The mechanic challenges you, because you have to decide which place is safe enough for resources to use for that turn and which is not. The trick is that the same place cannot recive multiple orders. Great brain teaser.
BUT the real sugar that totally separates this from RISK the board game is the buildings. Although you do get some points at the end from area control the real key is the buildings. Without them you are screwed! There are 3 building types (palace, temple and theater) and these give you a point each from the areas that you control. EXCEPT you earn more points if you have a dominance of certain buiding in a province. 3 points from palace and 1 from temple. So although a key is to control land as much as you can, the real strategy is to civiliced at it! 
The game was a great experience and dont think that this is the last time i played it!

Takana yksi järisyttävän pitkä ja järeä mättö. Eka peli jätti sekä negatiivisa että positiivisa fiboja. Ilman muuta ainakin toisen pelin vaatii alle ennen lopullista tuomiota. (17.3.2009)

Nyt on toinen peli takana, ja fiilikset tosi hyvät. Nyt peli oli lyhyempi ja kaikin puolin mukavampi kokemus, vaikka oma peli ei järin hyvin lähtenytkään liikkeelle. Kyllä tätä sopii pelata enemmänkin. (15.6.2009)

Having played only once, at a noisy place, and skimming through the rules makes this comment a not really accurate one. Still, I have to say the game looks nice. There are many cool ideas I like, specially the cube tower and the action selection mechanism. The other parts of the game feel more convoluted, but I'd still like to try it again.

A very interesting game. The cube tower, phase and player order gives just the right ammount of randomness and chaos, while the depth of the game allows for a very strateigic game. The cube tower is somewhat unrealistic, especially when you go into a battle and come out with more troops than you went in with! The game is slightly long, but all in all it was a good game and I am looking forward to it's next outing.

I become less and less of a fan of this game with each play.

Seems to suffer (in my 2-3 games) from a big clash between two players leaving a vacuum for others to exploit since they just wasted their force... Or whoever is not attacked, gets to focus on building.  Or stale-mates occur as people build up on their border regions.  These downsides are logical, but not necessarily fun.

Good area control game. Really enjoyed it. Loved the cube tower that is used for battles! Would rank much higher if it wasn't for the lengthy setup/start up. The game is played in 2 years. Each year divided into 4 rounds (seasons). And by the end of each year there is a scoring phase. I would only play one year due to how long it takes.

Quite disappointed by a game I was really looking forward to playing. I guess I'm of the few who do not care for cool cube towers. This attempt at a Euro trying to be a wargame just didn't work for me. Perhaps if it could be played in an hour, I'd be more willing to put up with the gimmicks of programmed actions and fog of war cube towers (oh look, we miscounted the size of their army - hey, we miscounted our troops as well).

I see this going up the more I play.  In the first play we fumbled to figure out strategy the first year, but by the second year, things became clear and stragies emerged.  Alot going on for a fairly easy game to get into.  Looking forward to playing this one again.  Played with 4.

Played with five. Knew more of what to do but just got blasted on the cube tower early which hurt me.  I dropped to a 7 as I think it's good but some of the randomness can hit a bit rough in regards to planning.  Not that I don't mind some of the random but not knowing half the turn gets to be a bit rough.  Looking forward to playing again now that we have five of us who know how to play.  Timewise, the game moves along as we were done in about 2 hr 15 min (and that is with one newbie).  Looking forward to drafting positions.

RATING: 8.5
This game needs an advisory not to play it with only three, as this closes out key shipping lanes that wrap the board around on itself. Without those pathways, it's far too easy to turtle.

With that being said, this game manages to be Wallenstein, only much, much prettier. I suppose that getting the latest edition of Wallenstein (which has the absurdly overpriced Tenno's Court expansion built in) would be better both in terms of cost effectiveness and in having a much more open map to fight in. I'm fine with owning Shogun, though.

Oh, the gameplay! In short, a bane to anyone with AP, but an excellent mix of long term planning and risk management, trying to determine which future actions will trigger and when and whether an opponent will attack before you get rice or gold from a crucial province. Everyone geeks out about the cube tower, but it's the planning, development, and above all the strict limits (both in terms of resources and actions) of how you can attack which makes this a nailbiter of a game.

Uncertainty rules the land in feudal japan. The luck factor in this one is just too big, you end up cussing irrelevant victories because it costs you tower-cubes that would've been more relevant in bigger battles, and that's just not right.

The order the events happen have a HUGE effect on the game, and it's really beyond player's control. All the decisions you make in this game feel like racetrack betting instead of strategic planning.

Yeah, look at my mighty samurai, look at all the temples he built, all filled with VPs! Totally misleading theme.

RATING: 4.75
Shogun is a decent eurogame, that is hindered by its unsatisfying wargame core. With only 6 turns to do stuff and having each action during these turns available only a limited amount with money being tight and the possibility of key actions to be interrupted (if you allow it or your opponents play cleverly), the euro aspect of shogun is agricola-like hard and well done overall.

The wargame part of Shogun on the other hand is extremely unsatisfying. Attacks basically let you trade units mostly 1 to 1 with a arbitrary defender's advantage in provinces without unrest. The main goal of a war is to capture an opponent's building or interrupt and threaten his play. Due to the symmetry of wars and actions though, any effort to raid and overtake buildings can be neutralized just by recruiting as many units as you do (there's a maximum of 10 units recruited each turn). Since you can only recruit or move and the opponent usually has enough space to safely build his buildings at least 2 spaces away from a recruiting spot, so troop movements can be countered easily. Since there is no advantage from unit placement etc war resolution depends only on how many are thrown your way, which usually results in the best turtling and thus least attacked player to gain an overall advantage. Attacking is mostly punished and is only rewarded if your target is unable to properly defend because he is attacked on multiple ends (which is completely out of control and would be avoided by turtling).

Like the cube tower. Don't like:

1. Events are revealed after you plan
2. Half the actions are hidden as you plan

Neither really add anything other than a 'ha-ha' moment if someone has a card turn up in the 'wrong' spot. Rather play with full information before planning.

With that change I like the game - best with 5 or 4.

I might like it better if I would not be quite as bad in this game. Somehow the game feels random, but I always loose, so probably it´s not.
Except for the fact that I have still no clue what I´m doing the system feels rather solid (the guys I´m playing with like it and I can get a glimpse why).
The theme is very loosly connected to the actual play. So don´t expect to feel like a japanese ruler while playing.

Fight for the Clan and win the power of control.

This is a very cool game(it is a remade version of a game orginally set in Germany).  There are some pretty cool mechanisms for combat.  It has a tower where your forces are dumped and whatever tumbles out is used to total in a 1:1 elimination to dertimine the win.  There are various provinces and based on various improvements to the provinces you can gain defensive bonus or perks to points socring ops.

Got a chance to play this at Bgg Con and let me say wow.  Queen put a lot of effort into the looks of this game and tightening up the system.  Once we were set up and running the game played smoothly.  Information on the cards and board was intuitive and any questions we had were easily addressed by the rulebook.  The new mechanics of turn order selection were fun and added a meaningful aspect to your planning.  Yes the tower makes combat resolution chaotic, but that chaos is manageable because of the multiple way to score points.  If anything the novelty of the tower adds to the games overall appeal.  I can't wait to get this on the table once more and have ordered a copy for our group.

I don't understand the high rating on this one. Sure, the battle tower is interesting but doesn't really add that much. Game feels very limited and takes a long time to play (150 minutes).

Es un juego de 3 a 5 jugadores. Se desarrolla en dos años. Cada año tiene cuatro estaciones. Primavera, verano y otoño son turnos de juego e invierno es turno de puntuación (no se juega). En cada turno hay 10 acciones posibles que se suceden en orden aleatorio. Cada jugador debe asociar una acción a una sola de las provincias que domina (se puede farolear, hay cartas "para engañar"). La acción solo ocurrirá en esa provincia. La asociación que hace cada jugador es secreta. Después se va desvelando las acciones y se van aplicando en un orden de juego (que anteriormente ha sido objeto de subasta). Está muy entretenido. 
La forma de putuar es por número de provincias, número de edificios construidos y mayoría de cada tipo de edificio en una región.

Shogun is a fun area control/empire building game, that even while it runs fairly long it feels like it is too short sometimes.

It doesn't feel gimmicky at all. Go buy this now! :)

Shogun est une version légerement modifiée du jeu Wallenstein, sorti en 2002 chez le même éditeur. 
Le principal changement provient du theme qui a glissé de la guerre de 30 ans en allemagne au japon médiéval des daimyos. 
Vous retrouverez donc dans Shogun, la tour de combat et le meme systeme de programmation, a peu de chose pres, que dans Wallenstein.

Played twice now and bumped from a 7.5 to an 8. This is a great cross of Eurogame and Ameritrash. None of the chintzy lucky dice rolls of Ameritrash, yet there is a beautiful randomness to the battles that evens itself out via the cube-tower. There's also a lot more direct conflict than in typical Euro games. Just an awesome game all around, may bump higher still on replays. The only thing keeping it back right now is it plays a little long.

PS- Traded my copy of Last Night on Earth for this. Awesome!

RATING: 8
I can see the potential of this game to be a classic. More plays will confirm if this is the case. The central mechanic of choosing which actions will be taken for each of your regions makes for a very interesting set of decisions. One cannot be certain of the outcome of each season (round) since your opponent's play may alter the importance of your own actions during the round. Though this may seem chaotic, careful planning and predicting opponents actions is key to minimizing this. Perfect information of the first five of ten actions is presented, but not of your opponents intentions, as action selection is hidden at the beginning of the turn. Buildings are typically underrated for scoring, as too much battling takes away from building actions, and sometimes does not result in productive scoring, as provinces score only one point for ownership. Excellent design and balance makes for a tense game each turn. Combat resolution is swift with the unique dice tower that simulates the fog of war as army strength is not absolutely known by either side. Plays well with 4 or 5 players. This is the highest ranked game that I consistently win!

Quoted from forums:

"Shogun doesn't have any serious flaws in my view, and the expansion solves perhaps the only three of the minor ones: 1) bad luck in initial province draw; 2) turtling 3) uneven initial number of armies in the battle tower. All of them can be however quite easily fixed in a simpler way without buying Tenno's Court:
1) make everybody pick from three visible provinces, not two at the start of the game. It is enough to allow everybody to have a sensible starting position while still makes for a different game each time.
2) the above, together with players not letting each other to claim a region early on by placing themselves at opponents rear is quite enough. It won't make the game as dynamic as Samurai, but it excludes possibility of someone easily winning based solely on their initial position.
3) give each player one more gold chest for every army in the battle tower less than the player with most of them. It's not much, but if you fear it will change the game too much, you can allow for only one chest for every two armies fewer."

The art is pretty. The tower is a cool idea. Really prone to AP. The first game took 3 hours just for the first half of the game.

Update: on subsequent play, the first half still took 2.5 hours.
This game doesn't offer enough for a 4.5 hour commitment.

Update from Jan 2007 to Dec 2012 (Dropped from 7 to 6) Even though we played in 2.5 hours, there are just so many better games for area control. The cube tower is obviously very original for combat resolution compared to dice and card play of other games. But the rest of it doesn't do it for our group. It's too thinky, AP prone, too much planning, random factors, too tight VPs.

Area majority is a mechanic which I like and Shogun is a good examples of it. Game is rather heavy alhough from the rules point of view it's not as heavy as one might think. Game takes typically 2 hours and can be exhausting while there are the other players to keep you busy as well as the game itself that pours problems on you.

Setup takes time while there's a huge amount of pieces in the game. There's also a cool cube tower added to the game that some hate and some love. I belong to the latter category.

The card 'programming' of your actions hurts my brain a little, but I love the action resolution, watching everyone's plans unfold either fantastically or by just going to shit.

This is a long game, though a thoroughly excellent one.  Thematically it is a little curioous, as you really are best spreading out over several areas rater than having one portion of the board to yourself.  Feels a little like a civ building game, but is really centered around the programation of your turns.  An excellent game, with plenty to think about, plan for and take into account.  Very very solid game.

After 5 plays, I am just not sure there is enough meat on this bone. In a typical game, you will only have 1 or 2 meaningful attacks. The rest of the game is just harvest and build.

Closer to 10 plays now. I don't know what I was thinking. This game is near perfect as it is. Plenty of meat on this bone.

Great game, I introduced this to our gaming group, and was an immediate success. learning curve is pretty good, but the instructions left something to be desired. The uncertainty of every battle makes for great suspense. One good battle in a territory filled with structures can bring a last place player up to the front and can devastate  a first place position. 

Awesome

RATING: 7
A good, tense and very challenging area control game. Far superior to El Grande, IMO, with more decisions and a good deal more planning and risk management. The cube tower adds drama without adding the arbitrary swings of luck that dice can create, and the planning phase offers some nail-bitingly difficult turns. 

What I see as mostly positives, however, are also some of the game's flaws. The crucial importance of turn order, and also being able to control the order of only half of your actions, means many of your carefully thought-out plans will be ruined or wasted, so the game can be quite brutal. Still, it's a good game. Too bad there's no two-player option, as that would get this to the table more often. My husband is also not a fan, so this is likely headed towards the chopping block.

Finally got to play this game with two of my sons (15 and 10). The 10 yr. old is surprisingly good at games like these. He gets the mechanics right away, but the strategy/tactics take much longer. I think this is going to be true for me as well! This game appears as though it will take many plays before the tactical decisions begin to sink in. Strategically it's somewhat straight forward. Great game. I fear, however, with the wrong players it can be a paralysis nightmare.
Played again with 4 players. A better game with four! More conflict.

RATING: 7
Based upon only one play so far, I think Shogun is a very good programmed action game. There are some tough decisions to make about where to do everything, balancing going earlier in the turn order vs. taking a special bonus that would help you the most vs. holding the war chests for recruiting and building. Also, there is always some risk that you won't be able to do what you want in a given province if there's a farmer revolt or if someone attacks your province before its programmed action phase comes around. But I like the tension this adds to the game. Position is very important, and if your provinces are scattered, you'll have a much harder time supporting them and holding onto territory. On the other had, exploit and withdraw (letting someone else worry about rice provisions for the first winter), is a possible strategy for getting ahead in money, which can be great for making a big crusade for territory in the summer and fall of the second year. Battles themselves were less interesting (to me) than I initially expected, based upon all the hype surrounding the tower and its use in Wallenstein. But I do like that the tower it is an efficient battle mechanism that minimizes down time, turning what could have been an eight hour game into a two hour game. I'll gladly play again (and again), but two hours is a pretty big time commitment for a family with young kids, so it will be a while before it sees repeated play. I look forward to the time when I can.

Shogun is definitely an improvement on Wallenstein, both from a game standpoint and graphically (although there are times when form has unfortunately trumped function). And the double-sided board is great - every game should do this.

Honestly, though I just don't get the appeal of this game, or why it's so highly rated on BGG (see my comments on Wallenstein for more). Of all the great and wonderful games out there today, this is ranked 13 by BGGers (as of today)? It's just glorified Risk, and honestly, Risk might be better. It's certainly quicker. I've played some Risk -- Star Wars: The Clone Wars recently, and mostly while I was playing Shogun I was just thinking how much more fun the Risk game would have been. At least the Shogun theme has more traction than the 30 Years War theme, which never made any sense.

Shogun is boring, methodical, process-heavy, and tedious. It has highly attritional combat that rewards waiting for your neighbors to fight so you can pick up the pieces. There is no drama or excitement to it. This is a game for fans of euros who really want to be playing Risk in their heart of hearts, but can't bring themselves to do it. But if you want that sort of game, there is far better stuff out there. I've mentioned the two Star Wars-themed Risk games, but I'd also take Nexus Ops or Friedrich. The only advantage of Wallensetin/Shogun is the lack of downtime. This is not trivial, to say the least, but you can't make a boring game good just by getting rid of downtime.

I like this about the same as Wallenstein.  The bidding for turn order is a great addition to the system, and fixes a problem that I had with Wallenstein.  However, I'm not a big fan of the long, linear map layout; I much prefered Wallenstein's map where you had access to much of the map from wherever your current board position was.  In Shogun, it seems that you can largely ignore what is going on with the rest of the map, as it is often so far away from your position.  Overall, I think I'll make some modifications and just add the bidding system to Wallenstein to get the best of both worlds.

A cool combination of Euro and Wargame.  Each territory shares 10 options that it can do.  So not every territory can build armies go to war etc.  The cube tower is so much fun.  Pick up the armies in the battle, drop em in, and let em sort it out.  If your guys didnt make it out in one battle, they are still in the tower.  They will come out later.  Its almost karmic.

On the plus side:

The bidding for turn order / special ability is a clever idea,
On the minus side: 
Events eg. rice shortages affecting everyone isn't so good as only affecting one region.
There are 'gamey' sea routes so you can't afford to leave any area undefended.

Overall, I prefer Wallenstein.

An excellent game - highly recommended, easy to play, harder to master, and great game mechanics.  I thoroughly enjoyed this the first time that I played.  The Cube Tower is a masterpiece in terms of game mechanics, and adds an incredibly powerful random mechanism to the game that is much better than just plain dice (plus, the pieces make cool sounds as they fall through).

Overall, an excellent game, great for 5 players, and plays pretty quickly once everyone knows what to do.  One of my favorites, which is why it is on my owned games list!

My first "heavy" game purchase (though I'm sure there are heavier options out there!). I love it. Now, if I can just get my family members to play it more often...

The 10 choices each turn are wonderfully agonizing. I love the decisions, and the battle tower is great. This game might bruise some people with sensitive feelings, but I'll play this game anytime I can coerce others into it.

Update: finally got a chance to play this with 5 players, and it was wonderful. I'm still discovering subtleties about the game after 5 plays (I played this a handful of times before I started logging on BGG).

Update: another play of the full "two-year" game. I love this game. It is certainly ideal with five players. Because we keep teaching new players, I've not yet played this where we choose provinces at the start. Instead, we keep using the "standard" setup. I'd like to try this with the selection of provinces.

Update: four years... FOUR YEARS since I last played this game. And since then, I've picked up a number of "dude on a map" games, a genre I really enjoy. My enthusiasm might not be the same as when I first started gaming, but I think it's still a solid game. The angst in action selection per province will keep me coming back.

Update: Eventually sold this off. I like the game, but it is a notch below some more beloved "dudes on a map" games that I own.

Each player assumes the role of a great Daimyo with all his troops. To do so he must deploy his armies with great skill. Each round, the players decide which of the actions are to be played out and in which of their provinces. If battle ensues between opposing armies, the unique Cubetower plays the leading role. Owning provinces, temples, theaters and castles means points when scores are tallied. Whichever Daimyo has the highest number of points after the second tally becomes SHOGUN!

Enjoyable first play, but probably not my kind of game. With only 12 attacks in the whole game, it is not as much of a wargame as I expected. I suspect starting position is destiny and the feeding and building with a dollop of ass kicking would get a little tiresome after another game or two. The programming of the provinces makes for an amusing exercise, but is ultimately not that interesting.

Alright, here's the deal.  SHOGUN is pretty much a more refined, slightly tweaked version of WALLENSTEIN.  With that in mind, this game under either title is far and away the best of the "heavy" Euros and it is also the best Euro outside of the SETTLERS games.  Much, of course, has been made of the combination of Euro-style mechanics and wargame elements and it's completely true- both are here, and the result is a compelling system that combines warfare, area control, economics, planning, and one of the most fun combat resolution systems since CRTs.  It's a tough game- every round is full of really complex, difficult decisions that can make or break you and the ever-present specter of peasant revolts (which seem to happen more than in WALLENSTEIN) is a constant threat.  As far as the differences, I'm not completely convinced that there's that much of a difference between these maps and the original- I wouldn't be surprised if an analysis showed that the number of territories and connections were very similar.  The bidding for turn order is OK but really sort of superfluous aside from the special ability cards.  The event cards are slightly different (better, I think) and the tower has a clear tray (very good idea).  I liked the Thirty Years War theme of the original better, but SHOGUN doesn't fail to provide a credible sense of warring in Feudal Japan and a much better sense of graphic design and layout goes a long way to giving the game a very slight edge over its predecessor.  As far as the length, I've seen people claiming that it's taken them 2.5-3 hours to get through half the game.  What the f$%k you guys?  This is a 2-2.5 hour long game.  Sure, there's lots of decisions but unless you're a microanalyzer or play with them then you can easily knock this out in the time specified, particularly if you do simultaneous building and revenue collection.  At the end of the day, SHOGUN (or WALLENSTEIN) is a better, more exciting game than PUERTO RICO, CAYLUS, or any of the other favored heavy Euros and it has a lot that will appeal to gamers like me who want something with a little teeth.  Completely essential for anyone looking for an accessible multiplayer wargame.  This was my 500th rating, and a great one to mark that milestone.

Shogun looks like a wargame but really is not: you simply do not have enough actions to attempt serious conquest. Usually, you only want to attack for high income provinces or for majority in buildings. The game looks very good (rating up by 1). The dice tower is interesting but allows for some counter intuitive tactics (e.g. teleportation of units: add 10 cubes in one battle in one end of Japan and 5 will fall out in another battle in the other end of the country). Also, the tower combat is unpredictable. (rating down by 1) There are too many possible combinations with unknown variables (should I build a temple this turn, where? where the opponents are likely to build temples etc): this takes time and may lead to analysis-paralysis. (rating down by 1)

I was skeptical about the tower, but it actually worked out to be a good, fun randomizer. It also adds some surprises to the game by way of army tokens you didn't realize were in there. I need to play this more.

Nov. 20, 2007: While initially enthusiastic about this game, a second play has shown the game to be somewhat dull and predictable. The tower at first seemed like a good idea, and while it can still hold some surprises, the novelty of it has worn off. I could still be persuaded to play Shogun on occasion, but I'd rather not play it more than a couple of times a year. I'd also likely turn down any invitations to play the longer, four-year game. By the end of the two-year game, I find myself getting bored.

Just not my type of game.  I love the tower, but the game itself seems too long and too short.  It is hard at the beginning to realize that you can only build so much.  And that you need to attack.  And because it is so short one turn of losing your income can seems to severely hamper your development. 

:star::star::nostar::nostar:

On the other hand a lot of time is spent setting up and waiting on other players turn.  It isn't that bad, but still...

Still discovering the intricacies of this one. Not fond of the downtime that can be involved in thinking through the actions for the turns, and sometimes the game feels like it ends abruptly. Might be a little long for what the game provides, but still great fun. I'm a serious fan of the cube tower.

Also, ++thumbsup for Queen Games for sending out a replacement province card (I lost the original!) all the way from Germany at no cost to me!

2011.12.10: Too much downtime for what it is; doesn't work as well when small children are running around vying for attention (too tough to plan turns/walk away and come back). Traded away.

Need to play this more. The game feels really polished, it has a great flow with a lot of ups and downs. The cube tower is great and really can screw you up. The card row action resolution can also produce moments of intense panic as suddenly a number of other contingent actions have now fallen over like a stack of dominoes.

That hour that I walked around Drexoll, clutching the Wallenstein box, only to put it back on the shelf pertty much guaranteed that I WILL buy this game the minute it hits the store.  Okay, it wasn't the MINUTE it hit the store, but Imperial Hobbies' Boxing Day sale did the trick!  I can hardly believe it was still on the shelf waiting for me! 

Finally got a chance to play it, albeit Pat and Derek's copy.  What a fabulous game!  Worth the wait.  The programming of the actions is incredibly difficult.  Much like Notre Dame, your resources are limited and your options many.  I really appreciate that the game is not a mere conquest game.  Combat has it's place and is neatly designed to naturally fit into the theme and the gameplay, but it's role is not in the foreground.  Fabulous.  

The reality was that this game was not getting played at home.  It's best with five players, so I donated it to raise money at the Diabetes Fundraiser.

Ahhh, sit down and play a friendly game of Shogun! You get to negotiate with your fellow players, plot against your fellow players and finally conquer provinces owned by your fellow players in a feudal Japan (that is if your armies find their way to the battlefield). 

The game art is great and I like how the board looks. The rules work and are fair. Then there is the battle tower...

...the cursed battle tower. You toss your armies into the tower when you fight with your mortal enemies and see what falls out. Some times you get the feeling that you are fighting the tower in addition to your enemies. It eats your armies and then when you are fighting in a corner of the map that no one (including you) cares about your armies pop out of the tower like drunken soldiers that rode into battle at Osaka but somehow ended up in a siege at Kyoto. Fabulously cruel.

RATING: 5
I love the cube tower, but beyond that, I kind of struggle to see why this is ranked so high. It's solid, but besides the tower, nothing special. Nobody in any of my groups is ever keen to bring it out. It sits somewhere between a euro and a wargame, but doesn't really work as either... Will probably look to trade this soon.
Good components, love the theme, solid all round, but something about it just seems tedious.

RATING: 8
Pretty engrossing.  Beautiful board and cards, and of course the combat tower is a draw.  Getting used to the choices made each year can take some time, but it's not that complicated, in the end, and I like the fact that you have to make choices in advance before they get resolved.  It definitely adds to the theme of running a far-flung territory without the benefit of real-time information.  I especially like that the peasants can rebel if you treat them too horribly.  This is Risk with a whole lot of leadership/political demands thrown in.  Great game.

Heavy game (for me at least) with complex decisions. Sadly, quite a bit a downtime destroys the flow of play, but since everything you do really matters, you are kept on the edge of your seat the whole time.

This game is probably the closest game of Romance of Three kingdoms (PC game) converted to boardgame. It has some area control, majority, and first of all, programmed action. The game is quite nice with some limited situations (you can't war with all), so it takes some cunning to play. But, the danger of kingmaking lurking greatly here.

My copy is the 1986 MB Gamemaster Series version.  (Its various names are Shogun / Samurai Swords / Ikusa.)  I found it at a garage sale along with 2 other MG Gamemaster Series games, Axis & Allies, and Fortress America, around the year 2000.  I paid $4 for each game.  That was my best garage sale find of the year.
I played it once with 4 players, it was pretty good.  It took a while to read through the rule book though.  A Japanese war game similar to Risk.  It looks like the 2006 version just reimplements this same game.

Even though the individual game mechanics present herein are not complicated, the many factors you wind up weighing do make this a medium-heavy game that I think I need to play a LOT more than just two times (so far) to figure out whether I think Shogun/Wallenstein is a true tour de force or not. But for now, based on the BGG system, this game is definitely a 9 for me. I believe each of my next few plays will reveal additional subtleties and considerations -- it's that kind of game. I also consider this edition to have been beautifully produced -- thank you, Queen Games.

I had fun playing this, but it would be nice if there was a little something to spice up the second year.  Having it be more of the same made the game seem a little long to me.  I did like the cube tower, though it did take a little getting used to.  Balancing money, rice, turn order, offense, and defense, and scoring was done in a way where it balanced well for me.  Tactical options seemed a little limited for a game of this type, but all the other mechanics made up for it.  I liked this one more once I had a day to think about it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.35
I loved the cube tower - a fair approach to handling conflict that adds inherent strategies - and the whole game feels a natural extension of this - simple to grasp but a fair number of pieces to provide breadth (and some depth).

Like most area control/multiplayer wargames though, it feels like it may suffer to kingmaking, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
One of my personal favorites.  It's a very tense game throughout and you'll have lots of agonizing decisions to make.  You have to weight getting the resources you need over risking revolts or working highly contested territories.  It's not so much a war game as an area control and resource management game, but war certainly can factor in.  Plus the cube tower is just too darn cool.

A weird mix of programming actions, managing resources, and area control.

Not convinced it is an amazing mechanism of strategy but it is certainly unique to play around.

Some think this is like a war game, but it feels a lot more like a mini empire-builder game where the buildings you create will win or lose the game in most cases while only a few battles are likely to happen between players. Timing these battles well is key though, so it is not unimportant. I don't particularly like this game, but can't find much wrong with it either and can see how some would like it. It just feels a bit slow to me and lacks a spark of direction. The tower seems like a negative for me also as at least with dice I can calculate probabilities to some degree... the tower seems more random and chaotic even if it might not be in truth.

The gimmick--the cube tower--is very cool.  Beyond the coolness, this one is more Euro than wargame.  Capturing and holding territory is not very important, so if you like empire building type of games you should pass on this one.  That said, there is plenty of surprises to give you headaches and keep you guessing, so Euro lovers may not like it so much either.  This could be a good compromise game for your AT and Euro friends, but then again, it may just piss everybody off.  I like it, and look forward to playing it some more.  I'll give it a provisional 7.5 after a half-dozen plays.

A few more plays, a couple of wins (finally), now I'm thinking 8.

The game has two major flaws: 1) it's really difficult to explain to new players, and the explaination takes way too long. 2) the use of unfamiliar Japanese provinces makes it difficult to find things on the boards.  That being said, I can understand how the game would be lots of fun if played with the right people, and if the players paid attention and kept things moving.

[i]Wallenstein[/i] clone with a slightly less functional map. The main advantage is that you can bid for starting position and gain the benefit of the initiative card of your choice if you win.

An improvement (?) on Wallenstein.  Bidding for turn order is an interesting addition.  Long thin board makes it difficult to conceal any province and the most economically valuable seem centrally located.  Difficult to tax safely.  Love it. UPDATE.  Chaotic as hell.  Bash-the-leader.  Can be frustrating as your castles turn to sand.  Still, I love it.  DOWNGRADE.  I'm not sure this does improve on Wally and I think I like the predecessor better.  DOWNGRADE.  There is something wrong with the long thin map.  Too isolating.  Why play in the middle?

Impressive.

Just exactly the type of balance between developpement and struggle I love. Not entirely focused on war campaingning with intense requirement on feeding the province with rice and developing the land (castles, temples and theaters).

Very Japanese'ish and close to James Clavell's master piece. 

Building stability and awaiting for the final WAR... if it ever happens.

The Battle Tower blends life-type eventful campaigning and political turmoil.

Just GREAT !!!

Only one play but I liked it. The battle tower is a great way of resolving battles - random outcomes with an in-built self-correcting mechanism for smoothing out the probablility curve.

Took the first game to get my head around tactics and it's not as potentially chaotic as it first appears it may be due to the limited number of actions you have available. 3 or 4 is probably the right player count - 5 is too many. Want to play again.

The tower thingy is pretty neat for resolving conflict.  The game has a lot of layers and seems like it *should* be a lot of fun.  Unfortunately, I just find that it doesn't come together to hit that "sweet spot" that I at first I thought it would.  And it's just so anti-climactic at the end...  I think it needed to somehow incorporate mid-year scoring, and encourage more aggression to be fun.

Just awesome.  The action picking mechanism is just as awesome as Wallenstein, but the turn order improvement just sends the game over the top.  Just remember two things.  Attacking someone requires 3:1 odds to be worthwhile.  And your taxation center is never as safe as you think it is.

Shogun was another game that Eric introduced to me in one of our weekend get togethers. I admit I was a bit excited to play this game. It seemed interesting and with enough potential for direct conflict to spice things up a bit. Also I thought the cube tower was interesting and might capture Becky's interest. 

Well I was right about it capturing Becky's interest, but wrong about everything else. Everyone at the table enjoyed the game except for me. I didn't hate it, I just found it to be kind of dull and not worth the time and effort required to play it. Because of this opposition, we have not played it again, though I am sure many of my play partners from that day would like to. I am willing to try it again, I am just not ever going to suggest or reccomend it.

initially I was hesitant that this would not live up to the brilliant Wallenstein, especially given the map situation. But it is a limited number of turns, and given the initial board-seediing and the number of sea routes the map situation is not as much of a concern. A brilliant, fun empire game with plenty of elegant challenges!

Wow, what a brutally tactical game... ties with Lowenherz for depth, but the chaos factor can frustrate the best-laid plans a little too well. The possibility of losing your rice or tax province to conquest is a bug that needs fixing... the penalty is too high for something that's often dependent on chaos; maybe halving the payout would be better.

Absolutely great, would be an easy 9, but as a personal taste, I don't like to interrupt the game flow to count points and reset revolts (I dislike doing the same in Amun-Re). It's an ok mechanics for the game, but it feels like a deus ex machina to me...

Revolutionary idea with the Dice Tower. Great Japanese theme. Very well balanced. The length of the game and the fact that it is next to impossible to unify the whole Japan within two years are the reasons why it does not get a "10".

I had a lot of fun with this game, yet I think many things should be ajusted so that the game is a little less random on the fights. Also the main rules book is in several languages, I read the english, the french and the spanish rules, well not all the rules are exactly the same in the three books...

Wallenstein redux, with better production and art.  Only complaint is that rice and gold should have been on the maps.  The extra mapside is a real plus.   Very fun gameplay, with plenty of surprises that you don't see coming due to the way actions are planned.  And how about that tower?   One of the most unique components in all of gaming.   Combat is bloody and uncertain.   Civilian uprising and attrition are well-handled in a simple and functional ways as a result.   Points can be earned by conquest or development, and both methods (or a mix) are viable.   It's a unique and well-designed game, simple as that.

Awesome! Perhaps a little too much like El Grande, but boy, I had a great time playing this one. I loved deciding how I was going to use each of my provinces. This mechanic seemed pretty unique especially how it was coupled with the bonus card and the order of the actions. The cube tower...not sure what to say about it. It was certainly more interesting than rolling dice to resolve battles, but seemed a little too random. Look forward to more plays.

RATING: 6.75
A weird cross between euro and fighting: you get points by building buildings, and most points wins, but you also get points by holding territory, and you can punch the other players and take their stuff.  I like the programming aspect, but it can be pretty brutal.  If you tell a province to tax, and attack comes up before tax, another player can steal the spot before you get any money.  The game's only 6 turns long, so the loss of 1/6th of your income is a serious blow.  Not sure whether I prefer this version or Wallenstein, or which side of the map I like better.  Think they're all about the same.

Bump this to an 8. It might be the growing maturity in my game group but people tend to take an easy going attitude to direct confrontation in this game that makes it a real pleasure to play. Also the cube tower provides so much entertainment. Shogun is perhaps a little bit rules heavy compared with the latest generation of dudes on a map games but given the amount of entertainment its given me I have to rate it close to Dune and Ascending Empires.
_________
Clever orders selection and execution system and the cube tower is great. This game is perhaps a master piece in the balance of hidden vs open information. It gives you enough information to strategise but enough is hidden to drive suspense. Whilst the games subsystems are a phenomenal puzzle the core suffers from problems common to multiplayer war games. The best strategy is to try and duck out of conflict and just build through the mid game and swing hard at the end. Once everyone realises this the mid hour of the game can get rather dull. If you attack to early you just leave yourself exposed to the other players.

Shogun is a newer version of Wallenstein, Wallenstein takes place in Germany. Shogun takes place in Japon.

Of the two versions, I prefer the original. I don`t like the map very much in Shogun. On the good side, in Shogun was is good is the turn order. You get a card where your at on the turn order. The cards do different things. You don`t have that in Wallenstein.

A bit of randomness, but the player-created chaos dwarfs it in my current understanding of the game. I don't think I like the starting province draft.

I'd give this another try. It's very long for something that, while it was interesting, I didn't enjoy much. Lots of analysis seems to be needed to determine which actions to do where, but then - chaos! That will make me reticent to play again if there's a different medium to heavy game on offer.

A fun attack your neighbour game, really reminds me of Risk. The trick is, you need to utilize all your provinces in a myriad of ways to be successful. Carefully picking your battles can guarantee success, but with the fantastic dice tower involved, nothing is certain. I love that even when you lose a battle, you know your cubes are just waiting for you for a future chance at victory.

Clever use of the tower to replace a dice mechanic. The game seems to end prematurely, with only 6 turns, some game decisions become too tight for any long term planing. Also, it suffers from a few design flaws making the flow of the game a bit less smooth... Aside from that it's great!

Rating after first play - 8. Had a good time playing this last night, impressive amount of decisions packed into two hours. Cube tower resolves combat instantly, which probably brings the game's time down at least an hour. Rating may go up after more plays, the only lingering doubt I have is that there are actually too many choices. Another play will have to settle that. 

Second play- Huge fall for me. I can't believe that this is a top game. If the cube tower wasn't a part of this game I don't think this game would have the reputation it does. 

I play games to get together with people and although you're all sitting at the table, a good 50% of this game is spent face down looking at your player mat.

Very good. Though I think that I prefer Wallenstein because of the greater number and variability of the event cards, I think Shogun may get the gameplay edge due to the ability to bid for turn order. That said, I still prefer the 30-years-war theme to yet another medieval Japan game.

Reiterating my comments for Wallenstein:  "Another one of my "9"s.  Wallenstein is a great game of resource management, warfare and area control.  The mechanics of giving orders to each of the provinces coupled with the variability in with which these orders get executed is quite innovative as are the unrest and the revolts.  Finally, there is that cube tower, simply brilliant!"

Shogun re-implements Wallenstein with some creative new features, the bidding for turn order and how the events and "rice tax" are handled being the most notable.  I like Shogun every bit as much as its predecessor.

As good as Wallenstein, - and the auction of being the startplayer gives the game an extra dimension, Though - the german names of regions in Wallenstein are more familiar - and therefore the japaneese names are a little "strange". But still a wonderful game!

Two games now in two weeks (one five player, one four, with the same people bar one in the second game). Second game still came in at just over 3 hours, (and at least one player wanted more time to analyse the board between turns), which is probably too long for what the game is giving me back in return.  Second game was very close - 4 players and 4 pts from first to last.   Some concerns about how obvious temples, castles are from a distance (tempting to consider acquiring some sort of 3d marker), and I think if I was to play in future I'd probably have the board between players, rather than at one end of the table to make it more visable.  We used the fixed start up both times - flexible start would possibly add to game length - the way the start up instructions are laid out, then the provinces are not quick to sort. Feels like an improvement on Wallenstein.

Great game.  I own both Wallenstein and Shogun.  I've only played Wallenstein online, and this Shogun I've only played on board.  I think I give the slight edge to Wallenstein, however, I really enjoyed my board experience with Shogun.  In fact, it's rare where I teach a game to 4 people (5 of us total) and everyone absolutely loved the game.  They even wanted to play again (some wanted to extend it to 4 years), but there wasn't time.  Definitely a winner & will break out more often now.  Edit: have played Shogun twice now with the same group, and all had the same feeling as last time.

An improvement on what was a definitive classic.  The subtle but significant changes are welcomed.  The turn order auction and the special powers which replace a random and arbitrary process works very well.  This added dimension piles on more difficult choices.  I find the map allows for more conflict than Wallenstein; while there are still local feuds, it feels more crowded.  The role and impact of the farmers is more streamlined and logical in Shogun; they no longer support you if a rice collection or tax was levied in a province.  The artwork are beautiful but I do have a complaint about the warping boards.  The transparent base for the tower is a nice touch.

Sin duda, shogun fue una compra acertada, estoy muy feliz de haberlo obtenido. Este fin de semana tuve la suerte de estrenarlo en casa de amigos y me pareciÃ³ un juegazo de esos ke te kedas pensando toda la noche en el, y despiertas te levantas y lo tomas entre tus manos y dices: "que juegazo".
Tantas cosas por hacer en la etapa de planificaciÃ³n de acciones Â¡por dios!.
Los nervios te empiezan a generar molestia al no querer escuchar a los demas a los demÃ¡s  decir: "ya estamos listos", y tu aun pensando y planificando tus acciones, un paso en falso y zuack!!!. Hay momentos que solo existes tu y el juego los demÃ¡s no existen , es increÃ­ble no quieres ke te pregunten nada, NADA!!! En ese momento estas planificando y necesitas ese anuncio "NO MOLESTAR".
Que puedo hacer ? obtengo mas arroz?, mas impuestos?, conquisto mas territorios?, refuerzo ejÃ©rcitos?, etc.

JuguÃ© con un grupo no gamers y les encanto, las peleas son fenomenales y me encanta la torre de combate, todo un acierto!!

Un Gran juego!!

Fun, beautiful game.  Love the tower!  It's a planning game with an occasional battle, so the war element is secondary to the building.  The only negative for me is that Shogun has a lot of cards and small decks that you have to upkeep.  I wish it was more streamlined.  The game limits how many battles and actions you can take so it doesn't have a wide open feel like some other area majority games.  It keeps all the players in close step since they're all just arranging the same set of turn options.  Doesn't feel like much room for a sweeping stroke here- just be efficient and plan the best.  I'm not sure if that will get old for me or not... Logic lovers will adore it, but for me it has a feeling of Elfenland -planning ahead and plotting  your turn in advance.  

Note:  It's ironic that in a game of detailed planning the funnest part is the cube tower, which is so fun because it's so unpredictable!

RATING: 6
Really starts getting tense in the second year - love this game in so many ways.  It took a few plays to understand how to effectively use battles.  I think a lot of people look at the map the first time and get into a risk/world domination frame of mind when really you can only hold on to a few more provinces than you start with and you don't get that many actions in the whole game to do much more.  It's more about morphing your territory to take advantage of the most building bonuses or making a grab of your opponents buildings.  Once you get that, I find the strategy very enjoyable.  Since there's a bit of chance, it's easy to find competition for this game, yet I constantly find myself in agonizing, brain-burning situations.  This one is definitely going to see a lot of play. 

Update: well, it doesn't see so much play :)  There's enough randomness that the hardcore players don't really suggest it that often, and it's long enough the lighter players don't suggest it either.  I still really enjoy this, but I've matured a lot as a gamer since I first discovered it, and there's just so many other games I'd rather play in that time frame.

I've played Wallenstein on SBW quite a few times and love it, and when I finally got the chance to play Shogun as a boardgame, I enjoyed it too - just not quite as much as I thought.  I love the decisions to make in it, and that most of the decision-making is done at the same time your opponents are doing theirs.  But it is a very fiddly game, and after being accustomed to the computer taking care of the details, it takes some getting used to.  Another minor gripe I wasn't expecting to have: the cube tower is very easy to bump if it's sitting on the same table as the board - just bumping the table can cause more of those hidden cubes to come down the tower.  I'm expecting my rating to go up to 9 after a couple of more plays.

This is another game that I own and like. The randomness is toned down and the idea that the events happen in a random order not entirerly known by the players is nice. Still, the game is very long and two years isn´t much.

Nagyon érdekelt, mert szeretem a területfoglalást és jó ötletnek tűnt a torony is, mivel azt gondoltam, hogy ugyan szerencsét visz a játékba, de olyan jópofa módon, hogy arra nem nem lehet haragudni.
Sajnos csalódtam az első játék után. A főbb problémáim ezek voltak.
1. A torony ugyan nagyon jópofa, de jóval kiszámíthatatlanabb, mint akár a rizikós kockadobálás, mert akár nagyságrendbeli különbségeket is tud generálni. Nomeg elvileg lehet számolni, hogy akkor most miből hány van bent, de kinek van erre energiája, illetve kit szórakoztat ez?
2. A játékidőből nagyon sokat vesz el az adminisztráció. A 150 percnek kb. a felében játszottunk valójában. 
3. Nagyon sok mindenre kell figyelni (akciósorrend, játékossorrend, lehetséges eseménykártyák), és mindezt mérlegelve megválasztani az akcióidat, de közben meg akkora a káosz a csaták miatt, hogy egyáltalán nem mehetsz biztosra sehol semmivel. Kicsit olyan érésem volt, mintha totál random cselekedetekkel, se lennék sokkal hátrébb, mint ahova fél óra gondolkodás után jutok.
4. Nem teljesen sikerült megértenem a kezdő területek szétosztásában a rációt, de ez talán mindegy is mert a haladó játékban úgyis draftolás lesz már.

Mindezek ellenére szeretnék adni neki még egy esélyt, mert lehet, hogy csak az első játék volt ilyen nyögvenyelős.

So much is super cool about this game, but I'm not sure it all came together in a package I can love.  With only 6 turns, the games always feel like they end prematurely, just as things are getting interesting.  But it couldn't really go on longer because of supply limitations and the amount of time required for each turn.  Will update rating after further plays.

The more I play this the more I like it. It really is very good (even if I've never come close to winning it): delicately balanced with only six action rounds to do things but you have to do things and you have to do them right. The battle tower keeps battles feeling fair while adding some excitement, the rice mechanic stops one person just bullying everyone else out of their provinces (although I suspect its bark is probably worse than its bite), and there's some simple joy to building castles and shrines and theatres, isn't there? Plus if you're sensible you can get it all done in under two hours, which is a good length of time for it to last.

RATING: 8.5
Really Nice game. I've never played Wallenstein so I can't tell wich version has more appeal. Many of the mechanics are interesting because they give a good compromise between randomness and strategic choices. I'm thinking to the bid for the special cards/turn order and the 5 action cards window especially.
The mechanism of the tower maybe gives too much randomness. Or maybe not, though. In fact if a battle goes wrong because my armies didn't come out of the tower, it means that in the tower I have many armies, and in the next battle there's more chance that my armies will come out. ^_^

I've only played twice so far, but have enjoyed the game more with each time. The relatively small number of turns and nasty consequences of winter keep the tension very high, and I like the weird dice-tower-like thing much more than expected as a mechanic. It adds a big element of chance to the combat, but makes every battle feel risky (even a peasant revolt), forcing you to plan very carefully before committing to an attack, and stops the game from being too combat-heavy.

Very much like Wallenstein, though I like the wallpaper of Shogun more. It's an interesting game for sure, though it can feel a little long. In fact, we couldn't finish our game of it due to running out of time, but I'm rating it as I certainly got the feel for it enough to know whether I like it or not.  I like the cube tower - don't love it - but as things go it is certainly not a gimmick but a device to determine battles. How it is implemented is actually quite nifty. I just enjoy more involving combat systems for games like this. Usually combat is the most interesting part of a Euro-hybrid "dudes on a map" game, and I'm not sure if throwing cubes into a randomizer is wholly satisfying. But again, it's nifty and kinda fun and while thematically it's a bit screwy it does do the job.

Managed to play half a game with 5 players.
Rather long setup and card play can be fiddly.
A lot of elements and variables to keep track of: strategy unveiled itself on the 3rd round. Battles are vicious and often resulted in ties meaning the province is lost to both players..tough.
length and  intensity of play means this one might not be coming out as often as the others.

RATING: 3
Much the same as Wallenstein.  I just feel like I am bound by the rules, and that I never really get involved with what is occuring on the board.  It may sound odd, but I think Risk is a better engine than this.  The last comment is said largely because of expectation going into this game.  You want to feel as though you are at war, pushing boundaries and seizing control of an empire.  I don't get this feeling with Shogun. War is only part of the game in Shogun, and a very small part at that.  Shogun is more of an economic engine with resource management. The dice tower is a nice novelty, but it rewards in the same way as rolling dice does in Risk - Whomever has the higher number of troops has the better odds (this leads to another question of why people accept randomizers in some games and loathe others for having it).  I also feel there are a lot of touches in Shogun that are added on for gaminess, and are not really thematic in anyway - and maybe misguidedly I expected some theme from this title (and for me theme is never really a make or break).  Although I do enjoy simultaneous action selection games, the fact that a player can only do one action with a state seems strange (one of the gamey design decisions aforementioned).  I doubt that the entire military would be involved in collecting taxes, and therefore prevented from invading an enemy territory.  I find Shogun is at that middling (half-baked) stage where it suggests a lot of interesting ideas but falls short on execution.  Comparatively, as "hybrid euro war games" go this pales to a game like Friedrich, which offers the Euro mechanic with a real feel of warfare.    The game works, I however don't find it dynamic enough or living up to it's potential.  It's a game that I believe decieves euro gamers into thinking they are expanding their range, and has lived off of the hype of a hard to acquire sibling.  More work than fun.

I'm still a bit disappointed that this wasn't a straight reprint of Wallenstein since I missed Wallenstein and am interested in the 30 Years War, which is a subject rarely covered in games.  Still, if they had to create a new game rather than a straight reprint, then this period of Japanese history is certainly one of the most interesting themes to use.

The game itself is very interesting both in the gameplay and in the operation of the cube tower.  The latter makes for a very interesting random element that introduces a level of uncertainty while at the same time almost guaranteeing that everyone will have a balance of good and bad outcomes over the course of the game.  

The result is a game that I hope to get more chances to play in the future.

Update:  Five years after writing the above comment, I still love this game, despite only getting in about 1 play a year.  Now that I have a copy of the reprint of Wallenstein, that may drop even further, but it's still a game that will stay on my shelf.

Best of Euro styled area control games. The Japanese medieval theme certainly helps also, as does the "cube tower" to resolve battle results. Just enough theme is injected to keep it interesting, with needing to keep provinces fed, and having a watchful eye on taxes, while building structures (for VP's) and planning secret actions for the next turn. Great fun! Slightly better than Wallenstein, in my opinion, but this plays best with 4, whereas Wallenstein plays better with 5- so it's worth owning both, if you have the space.

This is one of the most amazing games I have ever played. So many options and so many things to balance the game out even for new players, and the tower is simply the greatest feature for me. I am one of those that ALWAYS rolls low numbers on dice, so the tower is a perfect solution for my bad luck with dice. Although it can be very unforgiving, but thats part of the fun of it. The price tag on this one is a little higher than normal, but well worth every cent. It's just an exceptionally well thought out and created game. I would give this a perfect 10 if not for the some-what long setup time and game length. Although I am sure both will decrease significantly with more plays.

Seems like a winner so far. The tower is awkward and gimmicky, but it works... A similar experience to Risk, but much more satisfying. There's a steep learning curve, and a lot of decisions that can be made poorly. Definitely requires a follow-up play or two. Fun theme, for what it's worth; certainly more compelling than colonialism (see Risk). Put on some koto music and brew a good tea.

This is the Euro version of Risk.  

How is it a Euro? Each territory you possess (up to ten territories) can be assigned to one of ten actions.  Two of the actions are attack actions, three are build point scoring monuments, three are to move/reinforce and one to get gold and one to feed your people.  Actions are performed by all players in a sequence that is randomly determine at the start of each year.  You win the game by having the most points at the end of the game just like most Euros.

How is it Risk?  Your starting territories are distributed randomly (OK each  time you are assigned a territory you can pick from two known or one totally random territory but it is still pretty random.)  Initially the reasons for attacking others are pretty vague other than "I had to attack someone to gain territory" or "You were next to me and weak" just like in Risk.  Battles are simply decided by the number of armies involved and by chance.  The cube tower is just a fancy version of rolling dice.

Shogun is immense with five players, flowing with four, quick with three and always fun. The dice tower looks and feels feeble however works out just fine, pay no attention to the details just use it, and let the other players use it too. Battle or build? -all come down to thinking. Taxing the peasants and collecting rice bring their own dangers due to the menace tower: we saw provinces crumble and smaller armies disappear because of the revolts- such a brilliant idea and mechanic.
Despite all the good in this game I lacked something I could not explain so I sold it...

A wonderful multiplayer experience. The game really shines with a full compliment of five players but it is very good with four. Use always the moon side of the board cause this side of the map is more open and corrects the ultradefensive tactics options that you can find in games played in the sun side. Shogun new rules about turn order are way better than old Wallenstein ones. The game is a blend between eurogame and wargame, although it is more the former than the latter since there are only six battles per year: twelve in total per player out of sixty actions. This is a fantastic game I wish I could have enjoyed with my teenage friends back in the eighties and nineties instead of Risk.

Actually I think this is better then Wallenstine.  IT's basically the same game with a makeover.  There are a few things that I think rank it above Wallenstine though.  First is the fact that the Japanese background and province names are more appealing and easier to pronounce then the German Originals.  The fact the rules are in 6 different languages can't be overlooked.  The biggest advantate though is the fact the board is two sided.  Adding twice as much re-play value as the original.  This is an amazing game, an a great cross between resource management and risk (or insert other generic military game with only one unit type) style war.

One play with four players and one with three (and I've also played its predecessor Wallenstein once). Shogun is a game with a weird split personality; it has the rules and complexity of a heavy euro-type game, with a wonderful puzzle-like aspect to it at times, but then the players are left at the mercy of the cube tower, the order of the action cards, the special event cards, and the unpredictability of the heavy player interaction. Individually those four things aren't overly chaotic, but when you add them all together you create a huge amount of unpredictability. Anyway, it seems to want to be both a thinking-man's game and a free-for-all, and it ends up doing neither idea justice. 

Overall I wouldn't say that I dislike it, and I think there's definitely some potential for fun in there, but I also feel like there's potential for frustration, and that keeps me from getting terribly enthusiastic about it.

this game is the perfect mix of different aspects. It got war and conflict, it got many strategic options, and the simultaneous action selection gives it a nice tactical touch. the bidding for the turn-order is also great, and a nice twist is that you dont just bid for the turn order, but also for your special ability that round. the tower also gives the battles a bit of randomness, but it is equaled out through the game.

I admire the design and the game is good enough in the war-Euro genre. The cube tower is a very clever way to resolve combats without too much luck. There is randomness in other elements, like the order of actions, but it is acceptable. The map shape of Japan, however, makes it a little unbalanced. Also, the game is a bit long, and if I'm going to play a game with this weight and duration, I usually prefer something with a Fantasy or Sci-Fi theme and plastic miniatures instead of wooden cubes.

This game is interesting.  With only the potential for 12 attacks all game, you have to plan and execute carefully.  Due to the fairly long play time I've only had a chance to play it a few times so far, but look forward to playing it more.  The cube tower is a really clever component that adds a nice evening mechanic that I prefer a lot more than dice.

I am not really into this game.  I like territory control, but I don't like the long games with generic cubes.   The cube-tower was a nice novelty, and this was the first game that taught me "In war, both the victory and the defeated lose", but still long and unexciting.

It's a little too static, a little too dependent on initial setup, a little too chaotic, and a lot too long. But man, that tower is cool, fun, and a great mechanic as well. I suspect that a better, shorter game is lurking underneath.
[EDIT]
I have now finally settled my opinion of the Wallenstein-Shogun-Wallenstein game "engine", as it were.
-First, everyone at the table should internalize what it isn't--it ain't a battle game. It's a building game where your products and infrastructure are vulnerable. If you think of it as a battle game, the limited opportunity for fights and the relatively static map will irk you.
-Second, initial territory selection is key. Like Settlers, you can lose the game before it begins in earnest if your initial selection is poor. Fortunately, there is a recommended initial setup for new players.
-Third, the Court expansion is quite good. It adds very little to the playing time (maybe 5 minutes?) and helps mitigate the static map by making useless armies usable. 
-Fourth, it is best when played briskly. Very briskly. More briskly than people other than me seem capable of. When you've got possibly 5 at a table, the odds that someone will (almost single-handedly) drag what ought to be 90 minutes to 180 is high. This is sad. At a reliable 90 minutes, this is a very good game. I have yet to play that "version", however. 
The duration of the game is the real killer.

RATING: 6
Rating has gone from 9 to 6.  Good game.  The cube tower is fun.  My problem is that combat takes too long to happen.  You have to spend a turn or two preparing, then another turn attacking.  It doesn't help that there are only 6 turns.

RATING: 5.5
Finally got to play this one, but it couldn't deliver. If this was a 90 min. game, it would be much better, but even then there are a couple of things I dislike.

There's a good amount of luck and because there are 2 scoring rounds only, fighting is not the best option. It is expensive and opens your territory for others, while battles in the last round are pretty swingy due to majorities.

Nothing I need to play again.

It's one of my favourite games. 

Based on the classic Wallenstein which I really must play.

I like the theme.

The board and the components are attractive.

You have difficult choices to make which can be agonising - but that's half the fun. It helps if you can correctly anticipate what the other players will do. That inevitably involves some luck. Getting that judgment wrong can cost you dear - in one game I played one player tried to build rice in a province, unfortunately that region was taken off him before he could get his rice, it was a big set back.

In games where players take turns to move everyone has to wait passively while each player in turn thinks about and then conducts their move. This means that in heavily analytical games you can, unless helped along with the aid of an egg timer, suffer the dreaded "analysis paralysis". You don't get that in Shogun. Players determine their actions simultaneously. So everyone is actively thinking about their move at the same time. It is a brain-burning game and it is nice to deliberate over you moves. If everyone takes a similar amount of time selecting their moves people won't have to endure the long waiting times that you get with some games.

The battle tower combat system is fun and original. Combat is a valuable tool used judiciously. It is bloody - too much combat will drain you - you won't win the game.

In a lot of empire building games being in the centre is generally bad. In Shogun a central position leaves you vulnerable to attack. However, you have more options and access to more regions. Concentration in one region will limit you. In the games I have played people in a central position have often done well.

This game disappointed.  Overrated and overly abstract.  The dice tower is cool from an abstract perspective but totally craps all over the theme.  If enough cubes get stuck and fall out at the right time they can basically teleport all over the board.  Very odd mechanic for battles.  I do not mind the luck element in games and I do not mind long games, but this game has a bad combination of the two and has very few decisions for a game of its length.  The decisions are gut wrenching but its not because they are particularly interesting but because the game is so luck driven you feel like when you get a chance to effect the outcome you have to make the most of it.  If the dice tower was eliminated and replaced with a CRT and dice, this would be a better game.  There are so few turns in the game that you don't feel like you can really get your strategy rolling before the end.  Too long for what it is.  

Looking back, I think I was expecting more of a wargame and instead I got a shitty, overdone version of el grande with most of the good parts removed.

This game also has one of my pet peeves:  it looks wargamish, but the winner will nearly always be the player who was in the fewest number of combats.

Comment on first game:
There are a number of things I really like about this game: secret action selection mixed with a changing order of action resolution, those damn insolent peasants, and of course the battle tower which is just pure awesome. The fact that you can assign only one action to one province during the action selection provided some agony without making me feel too entangled with constraints. I didn't do too well in the game because I was thinking more about military power (worrying about invasions too much, plotting invasions too frequently, favouring invasions against opponents over territory expansions against peasants) than I was about buildings.

I find it interesting that you're often weakening your position by attacking, and that because of the limits on actions there is a constant tension of wanting to do more than you're able. (You'll get at most 12 attacks for the entire game, and you can only use a given province to either harvest, fortify, or attack on a turn, so it is difficult and expensive to build up an army and then use it to attack over and over again - and you'd do so at the expense of leaving other provinces weakly defended.) 
The cube tower provides a neat uncertainty to battle resolution - I think of the cubes hidden in the tower as your allied ninjas waiting to ambush your opponents if they have done a poor job of tracking how many cubes you likely have in the tower. Because of these hidden cubes, it is even possible to take over a province and have more armies there than you actually sent into the battle.The main problem I had with the game is that too much of the decision-weight is front-loaded and made with less than half of the necessary information, so it involves a lot of guesswork regarding the likely actions of other players (which you can predict and respond to, so this is not necessarily bad in my opinion) and the likely sequence of actions later in the turn (totally unpredictable, yet sometimes damning). You then carry out these programmed actions with exactly 3 (relatively minor) decision points. The game feels like it lurches along, with everyone thinking through their programming, followed by a fairly scripted performance of the inordinate amount of housekeeping required to carry out the actions. There is also a possibility of the initial placement (which has a large random element) being disproportionately beneficial or harmful to some players. Without a concerted effort (read: near-collusion) by the disadvantaged players throughout the game, those players so advantaged are highly likely to win. I can see why some people like it, and it is an interesting take on an all-or-none "wargame", but I personally don't get the enormous appeal it seems to hold for some.

Dirk Henn classic. From the creator of one of my all-time favorite games, Alhambra. This game have already been published once with the different name and the theme. With this version, which for me thematically works a bit better, theme is changed from Center-Europe to Japan, Feudal-Japan, to be more precise. My personal favorite era of Japan. The actual game hasn't changed much from the different themed predecessor. It's still about area control, it's a kind of mix between Euro-game and a war game. How that works for people, it's something that everyone must decide by themselves. The game has this not too often seen cubetower mechanic. There's a cart board tower in which players during gameplay throw a varying number of different colored cubes (with different functions, obviously). Then when it is time to do actions involving the placement of the cubes, it's solely about the tower and a luck element it represents that what kind of cubes are coming out. I personally like this mechanic (some other games just use opaque container or bag to do the same thing).
But even though I like the designer, I like the game on premise level, I haven't found time to play and thus rate the game yet. Too bad it requires 3 players at minimum, because I am often playing my games with two players.

I like this game, I really do.  The main flaw is that it is too time-consuming for fun value, difficulty in teaching, and inability to play with 2 players.  If I want to hunker down with a game group for four hours, I'm probably going to want to take an extra hour or two for Twilight Imperium, or something like Doom or Battlestar Galactica.  Heck, just play a higher quantity of games I enjoy more.  I don't have the time, group, or ability to get around to this game anymore.

RATING: 8
First play - still trying to figure it out. Combat and revolts are not explained clearly. It sets up like Risk, but with very limited actions, does not flow like Risk. With only 8 turns/seasons, and of those, 6 are seasons where actions can be taken. Each season, there are only 2 combat actions out of the possible library of 10 actions, so there are only 12 opportunities to attack the entire game. You can only gather rice 6x, gather taxes 6x, build castles/temples/theaters 6x. Strategy is how to maximize return on so few actions. Rating '6', due to initial poor player experience.

Update (07/07/11): It has been nearly three years since the first play. With 5 players, this was a blast! I finally "get it" why this game is ranked so high on BGG. Combat is deadly and unpredictable, with the cube tower simulating the uncertainties of war in feudal Japan: pissed off peasants, wandering ronin, surprise defections, enlistment in the field, logistics, etc., all in one massive cube throw--simply brilliant. Now having played Ad Astra, with its programmed sequence of actions, it is easier to approach Shogun's action programming mechanic. However, there is yet another element of uncertainty where the game dictates when your actions are triggered; you control what province it is triggered it. One must approach the game not to conquer, but to consolidate, as there are so few actions. Like EVE: Conquests, the game progresses ever so slowly, so reacting is not an option; one must plan ahead several actions and several seasons.

The rules are still shaky, but the production is top-notch. The board is striking, and the province cards are highly functional; locating them is very easy due to color coding and relative position right on the card. (The business cards in Rails of New England could use this kind of treatment.)

The decisions are numerous, and the desired outcome is unlikely, but if you can predict and string together a sequence of actions to net successful outcome, there is no kind of gamer high like this one! I am upping this to a solid '8', hoping to get this to the table more!

Update (06/09/12) 3 plays: Finally got it out to the table after nearly a year and it was a blast with two other Wallenstein veterans. Almost forgot the bidding for turn order and associated bonus card (for +1 coin, +1 rice, +1 reinforcement, +1 defense, +1 attack), which could steer the game in another direction. The random event cards mix it up even further. However, in a 3-player game, the narrowness of the board can make for a lopsided game. The two players who manage to get a good foothold on either end of Japan will do well in consolidating, while the third player (that's me) is stuck in the middle and in a tough spot as he gets whittled away on both sides. The current rules allow for drafting of provinces, and then it becomes a game of chicken: who will be "policeman of the world" and try to prevent one player from getting an area majority on either end? Unless all players keep each other in check, equally, there is going to be a breakdown in how the provinces divvy up.

If playing 3-player, I would suggest randomly distributing province cards (similar to the "French Rules" in Risk), and giving the players an additional challenge in trying to consolidate their fractionated empire. Otherwise, it seemed easily predictable who was going to win, based solely off the province draft.

Update (06/16/12): Played 3-player and 4-player. 4-player is beginning to look like the sweet spot. After playing a 3-player again with the original drafting rules, I am beginning to drift away from the random distribution. You probably need some group cohesion for the game to work. With only 12 combat actions and six moves, it may be tough. Still, we should probably take a look at the totally random distribution start and see if the feel is different.

Update (06/22/12): Played 3-player several more times and coming to conclusion that original drafting rules are fine. Drafting or not drafting specific provinces is part of the overall strategy of the game. Some drafts are going to suck, while others will seem ordained; that's the nature of the game. It ends up with what you do with what you are dealt, and it also depends on the temperament of your neighbors.

Awsome theme, awsome mechanics, awsome tower of death and just an awsome game. Really fun to play. My tower is a little wobbly though but otherwise its all good. Best with 5 players. 

Edit: I tried it with 3 players and it didnt turn out good. Me and one of my friends got both corners and my other friend got stuck in the middle. The corners are just to strong in a 3 or 4 player game, so lowered the score to 8.

Need to play this again. Seems like it has promise, but it's hard not to compare it to El Grande, which seems to scratch many of the same itches in a more straightforward way. I guess I need to decide whether I love or hate the tower. Right now I'm not sure.

Also, it took a really long time to play, but there were lots of distractions going on, so it's hard for me to know how much of it was the game. I'm afraid a lot of it was the game though.

Like a lot of these kind of games I can't shake the feeling that starting by an edge gives you an unfair advantage relative to people who start surrounded on all sides.

More streamlined than most Ameritrash games but offers the same multiplayer mayhem. Went a lot longer than expected. Unfortunately lots of players + long playing time means a game I will rarely, if ever, play. Which I only ever get a superficial understanding of what you're supposed to be doing. Which means I spend several hours mucking around making ridiculous mistakes that leave me far, far away from the leaders.

Only one game played so far.  Thoughts: not at all war gamey, like some people have claimed, and the dice tower is annoying, which seems to contradict popular opinion.  Clocking in at four hours, it my also be a while before I am able to form better opinions.  I cannot help but think, however, that I will end up preferring El Grande...

Just the same as Wallenstein. With the same issues (too much luck, kingmaker issues, players can effectively be eliminated early but need to continue to play etc.). 

Plus the theme is worse (for me) as I know plenty about the 30 Years War of Wallenstein and it all makes sense while I know little of the Japanese history of that time. 

However the food spots are slightly better placed and maybe a couple of other marginal improvements with the cards. So gets the same vote.

To people who like it... Perfected version of Wallenstein in feudal Japan (should appeal to the Mrs. as she lived there).  Only downside - needs 3 players minimum. To people who don't... Falls between wargame and economic game unsuccessfully - more of a brain-burning puzzle (think Soduko) with more individual (AP) planning than interaction - multi-player solitaire.  I think I want more wargame than this - doesn't sound that interesting apart from the Battle Tower which sounds like fun.

My favourite Dirk Henn design. I already loved Wallenstein and would have usually kept it due to the familiarity with the map. ;) However, the small design tweaks that Dirk did with Shogun did really make an outstanding game even better. I love the simultaneous action selection and the combat resolution with the dice tower. I am actually suprised that this mechanism has only been put to use in three Queen games so far.

Heavy and long game. Programming actions, semi-hidden information  and restricted movement forces a great deal of planning. Only 2 scoring rounds in such a long game means mistakes easily result in irrecoverable consequences. A remarkable game mechanically but also very unforgiving.

The Cubetower is very cool!  But other parts of the game remind me of RoboRally & I'm really not a fan of programming so many actions without being able to react.  The amount of time doing "maintenance" compared to the amount of time making important decisions doesn't suit my tastes.

Wallenstein moves to Japan, and in the process moves on to a long, skinny board with plenty of corners to hide in and not enough sea lanes to allow threats to safe areas. Shares the one problem of its predecessor in that a lucky/unlucky attack can decide the game, but for once in game design the original was superior.

Amazing system with a dice tower to boot!  The dice tower provides just enough randomness to keep you on your toes but doesn't usually impact a well founded strategy.

I don't know this never grabbed me. I don't particularly like the action selection mechanic. While there is nothing technically wrong with it, I find it rather mechanical and I don't personally care for it. The dice town is clever and fine and I have no problem with it. Ultimately I just never really took to this game. Sold it away. Haven't missed it, yet...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I've only played this once. I really like it, as there are a ton of strategic choices, from deciding when to tax, what to build where, or which province to defend or attack. I like the way the economy is anemic and causes you to really have to think about the order of decisions and whether you will be able to pay for them all. 

I also like the way there are random modifiers on each round that give bonuses or hamper your strategy. This kind of dynamic play is what makes the game quite engaging. 

I feel like I need to play this again before I rate it, but I really like it so far. My only complaint at this time, is the game seems to end too early. I can understand the constraints of time (It took us maybe 3-4 hours to play; probably a shorter game once you're used to it), but having somewhat of a longer horizon when playing this game would open up even more strategic choices.

I really like this game, but I'll withhold judgment until I've played it again.

RATING: 6
Gameplay is fun. Lots of meaningful decisions, and the cube tower is exciting and once you understand how it works, not that much of a random-fest. It loses points because it could be a 90 minute game, but it takes 2 hours due to fiddlyness.

RATING: 6
Combines interesting mechanics into a chaotic mess of a game. On the first play we all were very enthusiastic and had our "wow" and "ohhh" moments. But then we realized the different mechanics don't work together to create meaningful play. The cube tower is great, but so unfair and chaotic. The action selection by playing region cards on actions is awesome on first sight. But on second sight you never feel like playing with or against the other players. There are just too many variables to consider. It's like a game of multiplayer analysis paralysis! In the end the winner is the player with the regions on either tip of the island and the best diplomat. But play has little to do with winning. Even if you win, you don't feel like you've earned it.

To conclude, I don't understand its hype. Or my brain is just not large enough to grasp its complexity.

Not a terrible game, but certainly not one I look forward to ever playing.  In the right group, this game can be fun, but there are too many problems with what the game wants to accomplish (is it a war game, or just a development game?) for it to be one of the better games out there.

The cube tower is dumb. What happens to these soldiers? How do I attack with 2 guys and wind up with 4 on the territory when I win? Do they just pop out of wormholes?

Also, I have serious trouble figuring out what I'm doing with a fist full of territory cards and an entire player mat of actions to cover. I guess that as I became familiar with the available actions, I'd probably have an easier time just looking at the map and figuring out what actions to take where, but I'm not playing another game or two to get to that point. Ick.

Shogun is a great wargame that infuses a lot of interesting ideas into the mix.  I like how there is a definite economic side to things that can outweigh military campaigns, suggesting multiple paths to victory.  90% of the game seems to be planning with the longer "game" part being the resolving of all the action cards.  The cube tower, while gimmicky, is brilliant and at times even more vicious than dice.  If you're looking for a hybrid resource-building/wargame without the time commitment or rules clutter, look no further.  This game is king of its domaine.

An engaging strategy with some fantastic ideas (the tower!) and really beautiful components.

RATING: 7.4
After one play, I am impressed.  I think it is best described as a logistics game.  You plan out all your actions for a season at once, but you do it simultaneously with everyone else.

Other players tend to get too involved with fighting, which tends to just weaken your position when done too much.

The only thing really holding it back for me is the length.  I'm not sure why you need 3 different building types or 3 different actions to muster armies.  If it was cut down to 7-8 actions per season, I would like it much more I think.

Still though, the peasant revolts were *highly* entertaining.

Apr08: 4 Plays in and it's still a great game.  Imperial is about the only Waro I enjoy a little more, and I've only gotten to play it once.  I'm almost convinced to always use the predetermined setup for Shogun though, since the random setup can have *way* too much influence on the winner 3 hours later.

Great game, and want to play it a lot more than I have!  Think I might prefer Wallenstein, but this just needs more plays and satisfies the itch just fine.

Very innovative mechanics. Beautiful theme. A somewhat long but although too away from being a boring game. 

The Cube Tower is marvellous! It adds tons of fun to the game and fits the theme, like hundreds of samurais fighting in a japan castle and slaughtering each other then only some of them became victoriuos after flashy far-eastern katana duels. 

If you need a euro-wargame with sengoku theme, this should be on your list.

I might just not get the game, but i find it boring as hell. Cubetower is a fun mechanism, but this game needs loads of more interesting things to do rather than waiting, and waiting, and waiting till everybody thinks out his turn to start throwing cubes to the tower. I can't find any of the mechanics of this game minimally appealling, just straight away decissions dressed as brilliant ones. Too much boredom for a single game.

Man, the Battle Tower is fun!

Compared to most people who like the same kinds of games that I do, I am probably more tolerant of luck in a game. The Battle Tower, however, isn't lucky. In any individual battle somebody might get lucky and have more of their cubes fall out, but that just means you have more of yours left in the Battle Tower. Over the long run, the player who puts more cubes into the Battle Tower will win more battles.

This game is a crazy mishmash of mechanics that somehow work well together. There is a mix of open/hidden knowledge, vaguely Risk-esque attacking mechanisms, victory point buying in an area-majority sort of scoring, and only in six turns! The game can get a bit long and AP prone, but it is a great combination of traditional Euro and attacking elements. And a Battle Tower!

I prefer Wallenstein.  The long shape of Japan affects the gameplay in adverse way: some players have much better strategic positions than others - they have only 1 or 2 neighbours and can easily defend/fortify themselves.  Thus the game is too static/predictable in several areas (turtling detected).

I like the mechanics (issuing orders, VP scoring, dice tower for combat resolution), but I prefer seeing it in much more dynamic and vigorous Wallenstein.

Of course this game - as all games employing combat over territories on the map - sometimes suffers from the syndrome of 'no-win situation no matter what' (despite the best possible play), because the circumstances just shaped that way.

Sold.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Really the same game as Wallenstein so it garnishes the same rating and comments from me (see below). There is one big improvement in that Turn order is now decided by an auction rather than randomly but that is no where near enough to save the game for me. I don't remember if Wallenstein had random set-up or not but I certainly didn't like it here. I'm not sure about this map either, it looks like the North-East corner is a strong vantage point and I think the Wallenstein one was better in general.

================================

A very fun game if you can stand the randomness and unpredictability, this game has it in spades, maybe more than any other I know which unfortunately leads to some frustration. 

Still a good amount of strategy and tactics to be had here (just don't count on your plans working out), choosing your actions is really prone to AP, there is a ton to think about, especially as things progress and you are required to 'outguess' or try to anticipate your opponents moves as well. The tower is quite cool and innovative for solving conflicts and not near as random as some other things in the game, the main one being the order of the actions (the first 5 randomly set out and the last 5 random and blind!), this order of actions can really "make or break" your plans and the plans of others and gives you very limited control over what you and others are doing. 

Conflicts are very hard to carry out as the game is so restrictive in your actions, one province can only do one thing per turn and this makes it much more difficult and requires serious planning ahead and even then it may not be desirable anymore by the time you are ready for it. Good game despite these things but it does run somewhat long, especially with 5 players. Reminds me more of a restricted and random Risk with some nice added elements than anything else, only a little like Grande in the choosing of actions and scoring but this isn't so much area influence as it is resource management and war.

Update: 8 => 7 A second playing of this through the new 'Shogun' version (very little difference in core system) drops the rating and even the wife didn't like it this time and she loved it the first time (after she has played many more games she now realizes the negative effects of randomness). By the BGG rating system this would rate somewhere between a 2 and a 3 because I really don't ever want to play again, I think I would rather play Risk (and that is not saying much) as even it has more control, dice or no dice. It is a well designed game albeit it is full of randomness and therefore fine for some people just not for me. Everything about the game is randomly determined; Turn order, event cards, action sequence & combat resolution with the tower. One hour or less games with random/luck elements can be tolerated but this is a 3 hour game. My rating is for what I think this deserves as a 'game' and not for my desire to play. I might be a little too generous here though and I do think this is over-rated on the Geek IMHO.

Blend of Euro and strategy game. 

I like it a lot. The pre-plotted moves require some thought and probability/risk decision making based on partial knowledge of the turn sequence. Will blue attack me? Should I therefore spend money to reinforce, or take a risk and use the money to build a points-scoring castle instead? Should I gamble on building a temple, hoping the income phase is drawn before the temple build phase so I'll be able to afford it? And so on...

The good news is that as everyone plans simultaneously there's little downtime, so you're not staring at the ceiling for half the game waiting for your turn to come around as you are in many multiplayer strategy games.

Neat game.  This was the first time I'd used a cube tower so I found that kinda interesting.  I suffered from a bit of AP as did a few others in the group so the game ran pretty long.  I'd be fine playing this title a time or two a year.

What I didn't like was how the turn order is resolved: one bid for the turn and the advantage which gives the card on the different places. Two dilemmas:
- when I want to go first I must take the card on place 1
- when I am interested in a particular card, it may happen that I go last, even when I won the bid.

Shogun contains an interesting blend of mechanics that results in a tight resource management game with a healthy amount of conflict over territories. Strong thematic elements give you the feeling that you are truly managing a clan. The "cube tower" feature of this game adds a unique layer of unpredictability, and other random factors give it a "controlled chaos" feel. Not sure about repeat playability, but a rewarding game.

That cube tower, am I right. This is another game that doesn't get enough love. I enjoy the auction, limited actions, and randomness of that tower. I think it is a solid fun strategic game.

Updated version of Wallenstein. I like the Wallenstein board better from a game play standpoint. 

As for the changes I was never bothered by the random turn order of Wallenstein and don't find the added bonus cards in Shogun to be worth the added decision time.

The theme is unimportant to me so you have to decide for yourself if you like the 30 years war or feudal Japan as your setting.

The game is a fight for cultural dominance. This is achieved through claiming and defending territories and building castles, temples and no theaters. The game takes place over 8 turns, but two of those turns are scoring turns, so players only have 6 turns in which to perform actions. Each turn consists of the same 10 actions that everyone takes, but the order of the actions is randomly determined each turn. Also - and this is the heart of the game - each action can only take place in a single province. Provinces and actions are married together at the beginning of the turn. Since you don't know how the other players are allocating their actions and provinces and you don't have complete information as to what order the actions will unfold, there is a lot of risk that needs to be taken into account when you make your choices. The actions include building one of the 3 types of buildings, recruiting small, medium or large armies to a province, 2 move/attacks, confiscating rice (you need to be able to feed your provinces at scoring or risk revolt), and collecting taxes. Also, players put in a bid for turn order which also grants a special ability for the current turn, depending on what is selected.

It is easy to get caught up in building armies and attacking and then neglecting the building side of things. Buildings are where most of the points lie, so you can't ignore development. Provinces are connected to larger regions and players with the most buildings of a certain type in a region scores bonuses. Combat is performed through a kitchy little device called the cube tower. Basically both the attacking and defending armies (wooden cubes) are dropped into a tower that contains lots of little ledges inside of it and whomever emerges from the tower with the most cubes is the winner. It is a quick and efficient way to resolve combat and in our game the results seemed reasonable given the odds of the battles that were fought. Occasionally, you might take a province and end up with more armies there than you invaded with (as some additional armies of yours get dislodged from the tower). It's almost as if your opponents dropped their arms and joined you!

The game is definitely very good. There is an interesting balance of chance and strategy that make the decisions difficult. I could see how the amount of chance in the game may bother some people, especially given the game's length (3+ hours).

Buen juego.

Es un juego para una tarde completa, su setup es un poco largo. Se trata de pelear por las distintas ciudades de Japon y ademas mantenerlas y construir en ellas. Parece un "Risk" pero NO lo es.

Lo mejor del juego es la torre de combate, un mecanismo muy chulo para resolver los ataques. Amala o... amala!.

A good game.

It is a game for a complete season, its setup is a little bit long. You have to fight to conquer different Japanese cities and try to feed and build them. It looks like a "Risk" game but it is NOT.

The Combat Tower is the best of the game, a very cool mechanism to solve the attacks. Love it or... love it!.[/color]

RATING: 6
Meh. High excitement and laughter when the cube tower produces unexpected results, or when the order of events leaves everyone penniless. But just not as much fun as other games I own.
Update: recently read a comment that accurately sums up the game's shortcoming- there's a real lack of maneuvering in a military sense. After 3 hours play you feel like you are pretty much where you started.

RATING: 7
All the bits are beautiful and the double-sided board is a nice touch. Nothing new here mechanically but for the most part this stew works. My biggest complaint is that sometimes you get screwed by the order of events and the pre-planning can lead to AP with certain people.

Pros:  Wonderful amount of variation that inspires just as much mid-term strategy as it does traditional game-length strategy, as well as tactics.  The cube tower is a great mechanism.  The art is wonderful and tht theme is there, even with cubes.

Cons:  Setup is daunting; Takes quite a while.  Scoring is inventive, but not as intuitive as I'd like and people seem to have a significant learning curve with it.

RATING: 7.5
This game is the real deal.  A beautiful marriage of similtaneous action selection mechanism, area control scoring and wargame interaction (via the miraculous cube tower).  The 2.5 hours go by very quickly but you want to play again straight away!  Good fun AND good strategy - anyone should enjoy this.  Initial choices of territories is pretty important here, and there are Risk-like considerations involved, which is not a bad thing.  That said, DON'T come here looking for a wargame and DON'T come here looking for El Grande - Shogun ia neither of these but something different.  Some minor problems with players with AP, and some frustration with wanting to do more things than you can.
Update:  after 12 games it does get a little 'processional' - wash, rinse, repeat - which is weird for a game with only 6 turns.  Also there is the usual wargame issue of turtling=winning.  To be honest, there are other euro/ameritrash hybrids which are better: Age Of Empires 3 and Mare Nostrum are obvious examples.  The cube tower is still great!

RATING: 5
Much simpler than I expected. 

Shogun is the poster-child for procedural gaming. There are six turns, and at the beginning of each one players all program 10 actions in secret. The catch is that they only know the resolution order for the first five actions they program. Available actions include two attacks, three builds (theaters, palaces, temples), two raise army actions, a reinforce, and two taxations (for rice and gold). 

It sure seems to advertise itself as an action-packed samurai wargame, but in fact it's a very staid game of building and territory management. Each player can only attack 12 times during the whole 2-3 hour game. It's not about taking loads of territory and wreaking havoc, but instead about judicious use of provinces and placement of buildings. The whole game resides in the overlong action-programming phase. It's tiresome. The cube-tower feels like a gimmick to me. 

Shogun is a thoroughly mediocre game. The most serious flaw here is the map. One side is terrible. One side is merely bad. On either side, simply staking out territory on either edge (long, horizontal island) makes protecting your score a breeze compared to players who started in the middle. I have not played Wallenstein, but the smart money says it's far superior to this supposed "development." 

Update: Having played Wallenstein, I can confirm that Shogun is a step in the wrong direction.

This is a fantastic game w/ excellent, creative mechanics.  The mechanic of determining the outcome of combat is highly innovative where players drop their army cubes down a tower chute & whoever has the most troops drop out onto the collection tray, wins.  It is a strategic, diceless game which is very easy to learn & is a great gateway to players who are not into territory aquiring games & more into resource/objective-style board games.  I can see why this is a highly addictive game.  After one session of SHOGUN, I am ready to play it again.  It is a game which is worth EVERY penny you spend on it.

After one play this is neither better nor worse than Wallenstein. The bidding for a special action and the turn order led to money being more scarce than in Wallenstein.

A decent area control/area majority game. Great components and a nice "setting." It's overlong, and, like many area control/area majority games, it feels fairly random and it's more tactical rather than strategic. It still feels to me as if, with players of comparable skill and with relatively fair opening positions, the game could go on indefinitely were a halt not called after two "years." The cube tower adds a level of fun and excitement that keeps the game from a lower rating for me. Still, I like how the mechanisms fit together.

I like this just about as much as Wallenstein.  I don't find that the auction for player order adds all that much to the game, nor does the theme necessarily appeal to me more than the original.  Also, the map seems to be perhaps too long.  In Wallenstein it is easier to move around, though I guess it's still impossible to make too much progress across the board there either.  The sea routes aid in movement I guess, though it is more difficult to reinforce your troops once they've sailed.  One minor annoyance - with the game board and individual player boards, the box doesn't close all the way.

RATING: 9
Subtle game that requires very careful planning.  This isn't a wargame and I probably wouldn't have bought it if I had realized that, but Shogun has become my favorite non-wargame and I'm glad I picked it up.  The only problem is that it is too short.  Another game year of play would be about right.  I disagree with people who say that luck dominates this game.  Yes, you can end up the victim of someone else's strategy or placement, especially when 5 people are playing, but that is something you are supposed to watch out for!

The cube tower is simple genius.

2010 Father's Day gift. Played twice and enjoyed both games. I think it plays better with more players as one would tend to have less provinces to mull over when planning your turn - a little analysis paralysis can set in if you have too many provinces in your control.

I my two games, large battles(8+ cubes on a side) of nearly equal sized armies seemed to end up in mutual annihilation or one side having only one or two units survive, a meat grinder, making large battles something you don't go into lightly.

An area majority game with war game elements masquerading as a war game with area majority elements.

Fantastic Game! Very much like the Business World - Plan for the best but not everything works out. Beautiful system! Update: Rerated to a 3 - Just feels like your pushing cubes around in an equalized state - you take provinces, some one takes yours, like musical chairs for 2 hours. With the random set up it's hard to do any real conquering. Not a war game by any means. I do love the tower and actions mechanics though - thus 1 for the game and 1 for each of those mechanics. I won't play this one again.

I like this one more than any game I've played other than Struggle of Empires, for sure. Guess that makes me a weurohead? 

Outstanding design, gorgeous map. I can see how lucky territory draws can tilt the game for or against some players, but this is one of the negotiation challenges of the game; it seems to me that lucky draws just give the other players a strong incentive to beat up on whoever starts out with the most cohesive empire. It's possible to sneak by with more than one center of influence, too, if you're careful about your initial army placement.

Based on 4 plays.  Shogun is a tense game of economics, logistics, and warfare.  The amount of combat in the game seems just right - you can never feel too cozy on your borders, but it never devolves into Risk-like massacres.  Rather, military might tends to be a tool used for specific purposes, a feature rarely seen in games.  And the cube tower is just great...

That being said, the game does last a while, and with a slow player the initial programming stage can drag.  I also recommend tweaking the rules a bit (keep the pre-game seed cubes in the tray, reveal the active event before players program their actions) to ameliorate needless luck.  But these criticisms do not mitigate how fun the game itself is.

This game is more of a strategic game which requires planning several rounds ahead.  IMHO, the game, Alexander the Great, from Phalanx games is like a stripped down and simplified version of Shogun/Wallenstein, but AtG is much more tactical in nature.  I love Shogun, though.  The board and components are beautiful and the Cube Tower is alot of fun.

Only played once so far.  So much planning--I like it, but can result in some significant downtime.  Love the cube tower--every battle is tense, and, unlike other area-control games, the risk of going to battle can really pay off.

At its heart, this is an area-control hybrid game that looks like a Risk-esque wargame.  I love that there are so many difficult choices to make each round, being forced by limited resources, a limited number of actions, and lots of imperfect information.  There's still a lot I need to learn about the best strategy to use, and I've been surprised how easy it is to get such a heavy and relatively long game to the table in my gaming group.  Its theme, beautiful board and bits, and especially the ultra-cool cube tower just attracts people to it.

First played at Flatcon '07

Was sort of impressed with this game, but not wholly.  It actually seemed short and confusing at first.  This is a serious resource management game where rice and gold become scarce quickly and there are subtleties to the game that I haven't yet discovered.  

Quality rating: 7
Willingness to play rating: 6
Fun rating: 7

Some things in this game don't seem to work out well, like the dice tower that eats your unsuspecting cubes. Though it can play interestingly into someone's strategy if you're simply trying to ride the board of someone else's armies. Good except for the luck aspects of this game, I expected it to be more strategic and also it seemed short surprisingly.
Great theme and map, but I needed more out of it, maybe the moon side of the game would fulfill that desire.

2/07: Played once as a three player game.  Took a long time to learn the rules and go through the first year.  The second year went pretty fast, but we rushed a bit because the store wanted to close.  We probably spent about 3 hours playing.  Rating will probably improve after playing more games.  I can see where the goodness of the game lies, but I need more plays to properly savor it.

Only played Summer board so far. Nice area control / action selection / resource management game with a unique combat resolution system. Can’t underestimate the Winter phase as the loss of certain areas due to the inability to feed can have a big impact on score. Also, many aspects of the game are set up to dissuade conflict so battles should be initiated only upon limited circumstances. With turn order tied to a random bonus card, it often creates additional decisions having significant impacts. Looks to play best with a 4 or 5 players.  Predetermined setup is helpful for a balanced start.

RATING: 8
Shogun is a relatively accessible game disguised as a monster euro. There aren't that many interesting decisions to make each turn, and the cube tower skyrockets the luck factor, but it's still tense and engaging. Excellent for transitioning players from lighter to heavier games, and for those times where you feel like playing something heavy but, deep inside you, want something more relaxed.

With a mechanism for bidding for turn order and a board with fewer corner positions, this game fixes some of the defects of Wallenstein.  In the end, however, it is still a bit chaotic and I feel too subject to whims of luck and other players.

Very nice game. It is quite random, but still interesting and possible to win with less luck and more skill. Negotiations are unfortunately very important and winner (or loser) making.

--------------------

cool pieces. cool tower.

Fairly simple but with plenty to think about and lots of interaction.


- The main issue i have so far is that it is a pretty long game and not a lot actually happens... after all, you only get 6 turns each. - This seems better with 5 players as there is simply 'more going on' per turn

Tried with 4 one night and was not impressed.  We needed a flowchart to figure out how to war with each other.  I need to give it another shot with more time to sit and look at the rules while we play.  But getting at least 3 together to do that will be difficult I fear.  Plus that board is all long and stupid.  haha  6.

06-10-2014 - Up to a 7.  Played last night with 3 and it wasn't bad.  We played long enough to get into it, though we did have to cut it short halfway through cuzza time.  But I think this is probably at least a 7.

I can't say yet if it's just a random heap of random, or actually a quite good doubleguessing game.

RATING: N/A
Japan during the Sengoku or “Warring States” Period: each player assumes the role of a great Daimyo with all his troops. Each Daimyo has the same 10 possible actions to develop his kingdom and secure points. To do so he must deploy his armies with great skill. Each round, the players decide which of the actions are to be played out and in which of their provinces. If battle ensues between opposing armies, the unique Cubetower plays the leading role. The troops from both sides are thrown in together and the cubes that fall out at the bottom show who has won immediately. Owning provinces, temples, theaters, and castles means points when scores are tallied. Whichever Daimyo has the highest number of points after the second tally becomes – SHOGUN!

Shogun is based on the Wallenstein (first edition) game system.

RATING: 4.5
[2007.Mar.07] This re-themed version of Dirk Henn's classic Wallenstein by Queen Games is an attractive production with a great looking game board, lots of wood, and game cards with appealing art. [My only criticism is that the card stock used for the cards themselves is a little thin; you cannot riffle shuffle these cards.] The cube tower combat resolution system is unique and quite innovative. I like the extra effort by Queen Games to provide a two-sided game board, thereby allowing for hours of additional (and different) play. Nice touch!

[2007.Sep.12] The downside is that there are numerous sources of chaos and randomization which prevents any real planning during the game.

I would like to love that game but there is some things that are annoying. Maybe they could be fixed with some variants (^_^).

First there is way to much information to analyze and consider in your decisions. Placing the provinces cards on the actions is enough, having to consider season effects, special ability cards, the order of action resolution just makes it too much.

Second, the fact that everybody does generally almost the same amount of actions every turn of each type makes a game where everybody develop equally and gives up a game where there is few changes going every turn. It also makes a game where you cannot focus on certain aspects more than others.

Thirds, I just find it stupid that you can only do 1 action of each type. First because collecting grain from 1 province each month is almost impossible to exceed the food requirements. If it's hard to meet the food requirement it also mean that it would be impossible to take over all japan because the game prevent you from doing do. But it does not make sense, more province = more food = more things to maintain. 

Also the other things that annoys me is that since you only have 10 actions possible, having more than 10 territories is useless because you will end up up with unused territories. So to prevent both these problems it would have been interesting to play more than 1 action of each action type.

The combat tower is a good and a bad idea. The mechanic is interesting, but sometimes it gives very weird results like I get a revolt and end up with more troops than I started with after the battle. But I can still live with it since it's innovative.

Fourth, the fact that the order of the actions are fulfilled randomly also make it annoying because you cannot make powerful combination like move some troops on a territory to attack afterward from there. 

So there is not a very interesting strategy in completing your actions. Planning in advance is a good concept but being able to execute them in any order you want to fulfill your goals would have been better.

Finally, Castles, temples and Theaters are only used for scoring. They can have some special benefits but not all the time. And It think that sucks. I would have like buildings to have a permanent ability. Like each castle gives +1 defense, etc. So that they are needed, besides scoring to build something.

Anyways, I'll make a variant rule draft suggestion in my geek list ("board games are made to be modified").

I am a fan of Wallenstein and was happy to hear that it would be back in print in a rethemed version (although I did have a slight preference for the Thirty Years War period).

I love the programmed actions, the cube tower combat resolution and the relatively short playing time for a multiplayer light wargame of this sort.

Now played 3 times, the tension that brings is excelent for my game group. The battles, economic strategy, and the cube tower are great elements. My friends said it was like Risk is supposed to be, I agree in a certain way. I think is something like Risk, A&A but with the taste and "elegance" of Puerto Rico and other Eurogames. Everyone that likes Risk should try this.

It gives another whole level to the fighting and construction skills you already had from other games...

Since last year when I discovered this game we play it on a regular basis, even a big casual friend is addicted to this now ! Plays good with any amount of players, more players tends to end up in trying to crush the person in the lead half way though ...

EDIT : lowered to 9 from 9,5 because of people can be too far behind halfway and they just start playing random. And because defending is getting more and more common. Would love a new map in expansion !

So far, we've really only played gateway/newbie games.  We're probably ready to make the next step to more complex games and Shogun sounds fun (she likes historic economic/civ building computer games, so this might work).  The downside is the lack of a strong two player game.

A perfect area control game with clever interaction and immersive gameplay. Intuitive battles are the heart of this game (love the cube tower!) without being too fiddly and without suffering from things like the runaway leader problem while it lets a player come back from a seemingly game ending fall. Big surprise for me is that it plays very well with 3 players. There is also a very well designed variant for 2 players.(https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/322141/customizable-2-player-variant-shogun)

I'm loving this game now. Took at least three games to get some sort of strategy figured out...or at least a strategy I'll try in my next game! 

Last game I played was 5-players. I found that being in the lead at the half-time was a prelude to a smashing by three other players in the second year. I subsequently finished dead last...like WAY back down the points track. Finished with only one province after losing penultimate province to starvation-induced peasant revolt!

RATING: 5
This rating is fairly tentative because we played a rule wrong that made the peasants much too powerful, and also had to stop the game before its conclusion, but I think I got a good idea of the general feel of the game. I think describing it like Risk with a lot of Risk's aspects fixed is a good description. I say Risk and not some other area control game because like Risk the core mechanisms are actually fairly basic, but it feels a bit sloggy on the map and the game is quite long and supposedly epic. Like Risk the combat is fairly abstracted, but it is nice that if you get unlucky at some points, the odds are more in your favor (or vice-versa), and having more units is an advantage now without being guaranteed victory. Map is better balanced than Risk. The definite end is also good.

I like the action programming because the limited spots helps prevent too much runaway leader: you can only do so many actions a turn, whilst having more regions increases your rice upkeep and makes it more likely regions will revolt. The order things happen can also add more decision in timing things, although the technically 300 turns in a 5 player game is a bit much especially if someone isn't on top of when their turn is.

The revolt mechanism adds some interesting juggling of which region you should activate for what.

I really wish buildings had more to them, as they are 90% just different ways to score area majority. The abstraction of this game, whether via the buildings, the cubes, no thematic starting region based on history, etc. is definitely what hurts the game the most for me.

The 'basic' set up for this can end in catastrophe.  For a three player game- separate out the action cards with the province cards that have the same back, remove 8 cards, remove all 'sun' or 'moon' cards, give out 9 cards to players via an non-alphabetized list with some left over.  That's six chances to make mistakes with the little cards...Once the game gets going it's interesting, but the 'basic' set up is nothing short of horrible.
Upping my rating based on our last play--it was a ton o fun. (just don't use the 'basic' set up)

This is really a wonderful games. The fact that it blends combat, economy, management and area majority is quite unique. Personnaly, I really like the cube tower. Sure there is some luck but it is so much cooler than rolling boring dice. On the plus side, the tower has a built-in memory that gets you from being too unlucky.

The only negative note is the long setup time and the fact that some players can take way too much time to program a turn. 

Strangely this game reminds me of a blend between Gme of Throne and La Citta.

Autant je n'avais pas accroché à Wallenstein (le thème de la guerre de 100 ans ne me parle pas du tout), autant sa transposition dans le japon médiéval m'a de suite convaincu. Un jeu de conquêtes très bien fichu, très original dans sa gestion des troupe (la fameuse tour à cubes/dés). Un must dans le genre.

One of the pearls of my collection. If you like the theme and don't mind the battle mechanic (I think it's great, but throwing cubes into a tower can be strange to some people), play it - I doubt you'll be dissapointed.

Maravilhoso. Muuuuitas decisões difíceis pra se fazer até o final. Sorte/azar são sempre compensados nos lances seguintes. Alguém pode dizer que o ponto fraco é a duração, mas os jogadores não precisam esperar horas pra sua vez, pois todos executam simultaneamente a fase do jogo que mais demora, e o playtime é normal pra rápido dentre os jogos de conflito direto/war games. Ótimo custo/benefício!

Wallenstein has been 1 of my favourite games during my U days, and I traded it away as it's such a big box making transport between plays very diffcult. However, I still remember much about the game's clever mix of euro and Am mechanism and not to be forgotten, the dice tower.
Played Shogun with the expansion today. The additional mechanism altogether (I can't sort out whether it's from Shogun or the expansion), despite cleverly solve the 'stay at the tower cubes' problem, adds way too much time to a game already long and quite luck dependent. In addition, the elongated map makes some of the areas very combat focused while some too easily defendable.(In Wallenstein, the area is more or less square) For a game with similar mechanism, I would simply go for my beloved Wallenstein.

Like Wallenstein a very good game. Good graphics and some clever minor changes. Food supply is more important and revolts can be cruel to you. Now there's bidding on player order and bonus cards that give you advantages with one action.  Anyway... The 30-years-war theme of Wallenstein is more my kind of taste.

[Played once]
A few rules are improved (e.g. turn order), the map is worse (too "rectangular") and the core of the game is still exactly the same (Wallenstein).
If you own Wallenstein, just add the new rules to it.

My comment on Wallenstein (reported as it applies here as well):
Tense, strategic game, with some luck and many decisions to take. War is only a part of the game, that's based on planning (with only "imperfect" information). Best with 5 players. I dislike the combat system (the tower is a cool toy but still only a randomizer... and quite unpredictable as well!). Having only a few battles per game exacerbates the impact of luck.

This one looks like Risk (dice are replaced with a slightly more honest "army tower"), but is a completely different much more strategic game. Instead of blindly conquering territory, you need to consider food supplies and make sure you can gather enough taxes from your territories and avoid riots. The more territory you conquer, the weaker you get in those territories. And the way to gather points is by occupying (and defending) those regions that have buildings in them (not necessarily built by yourself). 
What I like is that planning your actions happens concurrently with your opponents. Still this game often goes over 2 hours play. But with the right people at the table, that is worth the sit, even though there isn't a lot of action going on on the board.

Very good game placed in an interesting theme.
The tower is one of the best concepts I have seen.
My ranking would be definitely higher if players had more influence on their general position. For me it looks like every other player influences my score much more than myself (ca. 70/30). I definitely prefers games where my moves are important for my position and other players have only slight influence on my end score. I understand that I should diplomacy skills to convince other players but this usually is not working.

3-5p. 150m.  I played this game once, and am unlikely to want to play again.  There is too much randomness, and added to chaos, left me feeling more like the game played me.  The first turn, I was so lost that I simply placed my face-down cards randomly.  The second turn I'd figured out what was going on, but still placed them randomly--only checking to make sure I didn't leave a bid/bluff card on the rice harvest spot.  Finally, by the 3rd turn of the game (there are only 6 in total) had enough happened to make thinking seriously about placement at all interesting.  I came in a distant 4th place of the max 5 players.

7/4/07: Rating of 8 after three plays.  Impressive heavy euro game where most of the decisions are intimately tied with other decisions.  While this is true of most good euros, perhaps I notice it here as there are so many decisions to make, and the fact that the order of half of the  actions in any given turn are hidden when you plan your moves for that turn.  While not a wargame, I appreciate how this game encourages conflict for similar reasons that many real wars happen; desire for resources (in this case, for points).  All in all, a very fun game that I'm happy to play.

Initially it looks like a wargame, with provinces and armies but you soon realise it's more about building than fighting...  that said, an attack at the right time can make all the difference.  With only six active rounds there isn't much room for manoeuvre so it's important to make good decisions right from the start.    
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Great game! Determining your actions before every turn assures little downtime. Theme is highly enjoyable, and tension (e.g. will my opponents capture my province before I can do my action) is constantly high. Little downside is that starting positions are very influential on end result (although the mechanism to place the opening armies is very elegant) and that extreme provinces (purple, green and brown) are easier to hold.

Rating based on 4 players.

The cube tower was a fun way to resolve battles, and I like the general idea of assigning actions ahead of time (it kind of simulates the "lag" of command in the time of slower communication), but this game felt odd to me. In general, in games you have a balance between having to plan ahead and getting the information you need to make intelligent choices... but Shogun requires you to plan TEN actions ahead with very little information. This doesn't make the game random, as planning for the unexpected is part of the strategy, but to me it felt a bit unsatisfying. I found ten actions too many as well, as even when planning I just could not keep them all in short-term memory, would get AP as a result, and in the end just assign the last few actions just to keep the game going. Not a bad game, but I found it slightly frustrating.

Rating after a single play, could go up or down. Lots of tense decisions and the cube tower throws in some fun uncertainty. My only reservation is that since the game only lasts a few rounds, the board situation seemed kind of static. sure there were battles but getting from one side of the board to the other, or even half-way,  is out of the question so a lot of the interactions are set after the initial set-up.

I've played five-player games six times, and four-player four times. Note: I played it predecessor, Wallenstein, once. Shogun is a very nice game that I look forward to playing again. Though at 3 hours, probably not too often. Production values are high, the card icons fairly well unambiguous. I still wish they'd just reprinted Wallenstein in English. There are so many games set in medieval Japan and so few during the 30 Years War. Why they changed the locale is beyond me. I strongly preferred the more globular map of Germany, over this long skinny map of Japan. This venue change was enough to tip me from "buy this" to "play someone else's copy".

Excellent game, I love it. Three small improvements from Wallenstein: 
1. transparant tower exit box so you can see the cubes that are still left over
2. the season starts with a round of bidding for cards. These cards offer small advantages and decide the turnorder
3. the event cards are open, so you don't have to memorize anymore how much grain/rice is counted down in the winter etc.
All together the randomness has decreased a bit. It is an improved version of Wallenstein, however, if you own Wallenstein already, I would not recommend buying Shogun as well.

A slicker, more compact, much more intense & less random Wallenstein. Love it. There are a couple of elements in Shogun that are worth nicking & putting back into Wallenstein too. I like the Feudal Japanese theme though thematically, Wallenstein is a little more appealing in that regard.

One of the aspects I love about the game is that you have to pick your wars carefully because they are resource intensive / wasteful. But you still need to keep a tension with your opponents or they will just run away with their little economic expansion management plans, so there is an escalation thing happening as everyone keeps a military check on everyone else, but who will be the first to pull the trigger?? Or will it just be a cold war of sorts??

Love the game.

One play. (Rate Wallenstein a 9)

Thoughts on differences between this and Wallenstein:

Bidding for turn order and bonuses: I enjoy the quickness and randomness of Wallenstein's system. Though it doesn't take long to choose a bonus/turn-order in Shogun, it adds negatively to an already longish game.

Components: some warping on the personal boards. The building tokens are a little too similar and "photo shoppy." Nice coloring on the map and tower. Wish they added the grain/gold numbers on the map (to improve on Wallenstein's lack).

Map: I like Wallenstein's grand open feel. The Shogun map felt a little limiting, even with sea attacks.

Very mch a gamer's game. Finally played it after a year of shelf dust. 5-player game, so ideal condition. Came in last after a 4 hour game. Damn. Still enjoyed it, thanks to all the stuff that can be going on. So I guess it's good....

1st real game played with 5 players. It's a strange game with a million decisions to make. At first it seems the game will be too short with 8 turns, then it seems that it will last forever, and then in the midst of fighting (which I discourage now) there's a measly one turn left and the game seemed to have taken just the right amount of time. 

I think my next play will be quicker, and my score better. I ended up fighting a lot and that was my downfall (that and the fact everyone else played better than I).

Oh yeah, the cube tower rocks. It provides enough tension and excitement to really carry the game.

The bits and board are of very high quality.

Update: 3 player isn't bad. I think 4 players will be its sweet spot, yet to play it that way.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Game in a Nutshell: Basically be the most famous warlord in ancient Japan. Building buildings works best but taking over others land helps give an edge.

Played as: 4 player

Pros: I like how the game makes you focus on what you have going on in your own territories first then look to expand when the opportunity presents itself advantageous. And the cube tower is hands down the best way of deciding a battle ever by balancing the odds for all players from war to war by ensuring equal loses for both parties involved.

Cons: Despite everything wonderful about the game, surprisingly it felt a little dry. I never felt too much tension (though it fully had my interest).

Other: Honestly, dice battle is never going to feel the same. I also really need to play this more then once to get a better read on it.

Best Use: When you want a battle game with minimal battle but still splashes of it over a 2 hour period.

I've had one play of this. I enjoyed it. The combat tower was a great mechanic! It ran a little long, but I suspect the playing time would go down with further plays. The one thing that kind of bugged me about the game was that I didn't feel like I could move very far. I wanted more military actions. Maybe a 3rd battle per turn? The starting positions pretty much were the ending positions in our game. Perhaps we were just too un-aggressive!

The extra ".25" is just to show my slight preference for this over Wallenstein.  The new maps (there are two) seem to make for a tougher game: travelling North to South takes much longer unless you use the shortcuts (water paths) and there may be more adjacencies per region.  They did an excellent job retheming this and the new turn-order / special action selection auction fits in seemlessly and adds to the design.

This is a re-themed version of Wallenstien, and all of my comments for that game apply here.  That said, there are a few differences between the games, and the differences make the game even better: instead of having random player order in each turn, players bid for it, and the map is a bit more maneuverable.  All in all an excellent game that I want to play much more.

RATING: 10
Awesome game! After playing it several times then playing Risk which I've known for several years, Risk seemed like a terrible game so now it's somewhere in my cellar. Shogun is a very strategic game where - contrary to Risk - the aim isn't to control more land, though that could help, but to gain the most points. You can collect taxes and rice but beware as this might provoke a rebellion in your own province and you might end up losing it! The more provinces you control the more food you need. This makes the game extremely interesting even though it may take a lot of time to play. But it's definitely worth it!

RATING: 7
Pick actions and move your armies to improve and expand your empire for most points.

Plays: A couple?
Type: Faux wargame = a game where you move military forces on a map, but where victory isn't intrinsically about conquest or destruction of enemies.
Complexity: Medium strategy game.
# of players: 5.
Playing time: See BGG.
Player interaction: Conflict.
Randomness: Low - Cube tower.

Replayability: Low, once in a while is good enough.
Fun: Pouring armies into the cube tower is one of the funniest experiences in gaming, so don't miss out. The murderous peasants are also funny, every game will have some provinces revolt, to groans and cheers. I'm also very partial to simultaneous hidden order selection, as it keeps downtime to almost nothing and makes for difficult decisions with uncertainty taken into account.
Memorability: Decent, but the map and armies are bit too generic to really inspire stories.

Thematic integration: Decent.
Components: Iconic. The cube tower is one of a kind. The map and other components are also good.

Who will like this: For people that like multi-player strategy games with conflict, this might be the best generic one.

RATING: 7.5
Interesting worker placement/area control game. Players take on the role of Japanese warlords trying to achieve the status of Shogun. Victory points are scored for territory occupation and for having the majority of castles, temples and theatres in a province. The USP of the game is that there are 10 actions that players can take each turn, whose order is randomly determined at the start of each round. Players have to allocate an action to a territory at the start of the round, so planning is all important. The other fun and interesting aspect of the game is the Battle tower. When battles occur, participating armies (cubes) are thrown into the tower and whoever has the most exit the bottom wins. The tower itself is constructed so that some cubes remain inside it, meaning that the outcome of the conflict is never certain. The game is enjoyable, if a little overlong (2 hours+)and some players will baulk at the randomness of both the action order and particularly the battle resolution. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The game has an awful lot of randomness, a bit much for my taste. I enjoyed the game never the less, but there's a limit to how invested I let myself get. Between the random order that the action cards come out (only the first 4 of 10 are known before you program which region does what)and the cube tower (combat is resolved by throwing the combatants in and seeing what comes out, it can be a little off-putting for me. The only time it really frustrated me was when I'd attack with, say 4 cubes against a region with 1 defender and have 1 friendly and 1 enemy cube come out, leaving no one on the board. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pretty good for what it is - too bad I'm not keen on these combat games, where you conquer some and lose some and hope to win in the end. There's quite a bit of chaos involved, that's all fun and games and I do like the battle tower. If I'm going to play this kind of war game, Shogun is a strong contender. But it's just not my favourite genre by far.

Indifferent.

RATING: 7
I didn't like this one quite as much as everyone in our group--something about the card planning board and resource management which made this pretend to be a euro, while technically with the attacking and cube tower it is actually more Ameritrashery--and yet the thing it is missing is the deep metagame--where's the deal-making? Where's the collusion? Eh. I won't say no to future plays, but I will still prefer AGOT.

This is a retheme of one of my favorite games, Wallenstein.  I like it as much as I like the original.  There are two mechanics that make the game fun.  Of course you've got the famous combat tower, into which warring armies go, but only the ones that pop out the bottom survive.  But there's also the less-talked-about action selection mechanic which is really fun.  You can do each action (build an army, move an army, build a temple, etc) only once per turn, and each province can only perform one action.  So does Sagami build units or tax the people for money?  Should your taxation action go to Sagami or Shinto?  It's a tough game, and lots of fun.

Very cool game with lots of player interaction. The tower can be a harsh mistress sometimes. Watch your money, and keep up on buying buildings. If you are going to short rice, maximize armies before the end turn. Revolts are not too bad. Don't spread out too much especially when a "-7" rice is your last turn!

I've played this game for more than 12 times and I think the mechanics are just beautiful simple yet the game offers a depth of strategy.

The only thing lacking is the nonexistence of diplomacy aspect to the game.

If you're into thinking game this is the game for you.

Edit:

This game will teach you Sun Tzu's art of war without needing you to read the book, at least the strategic aspect of art of war than the tactical ones. This game has won my respect to the value of board gaming. To me it's THE strategic game. The chaos and planning under chaos and uncertainty and the scheming, outfoxing and exploiting without having to resort to less than honorable methods such as lying and backstabbing like in games such as Diplomacy. If you like strategy get this game. You won't regret it. The superior in strategy will win this game! 

I'm even thinking to get a second copy for just collecting.

I really like this one. The cube tower makes the combat be pure luck based, but whereas in a dice game you my have a reaaally long bad luck streak, if your armies get trapped inside the tower you can count on them to appear on a future battle.

You have to calculate each turn with precision, because there are only 6 rounds to play. Very good game indeed. Even though the rules are really easy to understand it may be hard to understand at first, but after the first game I assure you'll get the grip of it.

The two (five-player) games of this that I've played have been kind of random.  Not the cube tower, which I'm fine with, but the who-attacks-whom.  Granted in the second game I made some grievous strategic errors during territory selection and then didn't use my large army on offense soon enough, but my seeming lack of control was not to my taste.

Which is not to say I wouldn't play again, just that it's not all that high on my preference list.

This game is in major need of some streamlining. I think that if the turn structure was less rigid and procedural, this could be a really fun game. It's very much like Risk with a Euro game built around it. The cube tower is a cool gimmick, but I like how it works in Amerigo more than here. Part of that is, again, because the way turns play out is very much a slog, and it just takes too long to get to the action.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Welcome to the chaotic world of Feudal Japan. Choose which actions to do in which provinces without knowing the order. Balance between development and war without knowing what you will keep and what you will gain. Resolve battles by dropping your forces in a tombola without knowing what will come out when you need it the most and what will come out when you need it the least. 

Normally I shouldn't like a chaotic game like this. Yet, the misty game board in the shadow of the dreaded Cube Tower conveys a thematic fog of the war feeling. You issue orders but have little impact on their outcome. Instead, you must outwit your enemies by deploying your forces where they least expect it while also maintaining a balanced economy and keeping both soldiers and peasants happy.

Many claim that Shogun is neither a war game, nor a euro game, but I don't care - the game experience is both immersive and cutthroat and simply fantastic.

The simultaneous deaction decision is very clever. One of the better multi-players games with conflicts - and despite managing warfare, the economic building part and VP scoring are important issues to consider.

UPDATE - Rating lowered to a 7. While I like the game conceptually, the randomness of cube tower and the need of programming 10 actions all at once makes it more luck-based than it appears.

Boy was I happy to finally get this game.  It does not disappoint.  I already like Wallenstein (see my rating/comments there) but they have improved the game here by fixing the random turn order problem, lessening the type of events and adding multiple maps to play on.  I am a Japan freak, I admit (having lived there 12 years of my life), but this game captures the Warring States Period perfectly.  Artwork is fabulous.  Recommend to anyone for a great evening of tactical fun!!  Thank you Queen Games.

Shogun is an interesting game that is made much better by the very cool cube tower and combat resolution system.  The game has a warish, conflicty feel, but it is really an area control game. Still, it's a very interesting implementation of area control, and any game that requires the pre-planning of moves goes up in my book.

And while the game has a lot of cool elements to it, it does seem to be lacking something.  Perhaps it's the constrained number of actions you will take over the course of the game.  Or perhaps that the map seems to greatly favor the players on the edges.  Either way the game is fun to play, but not one I'd really want to devote many, many plays to fully discover. I'm just not sure there is much to find.

Excellent. Tension, auction, strategy, tactics, resource management and a little of chaos make this game a master piece. If you like El Grande, this game is for you.
One of the things I like the most, is that Shogun is a game like no other. You have not played anything like it in the past... and the Japanese theme just makes it awesome!
This game is another candidate to become a 10 after more games.

The re-themed version of Wallenstein that includes two different maps to play on. Players now bid 0 to 4 gold on player order and which special ability to use ( 1 rice,  1 gold,  1 cube when attacking,  1 cube when defending, add a cube when placing men). The cards are now easier to comprehend, since they are language independent. It basically plays the same as Wallenstein, so I don't think you need to have this new version if you have Wallenstein. It's still a 3 hour game, but enjoying, if you like the game system.

[b]Shogun[/b](2006) by [person=60][/person]

A japanese-themed variant of Wallenstein, not to be confused with Milton Bradley´s Shogun published in 1986 (aka Samurai Swords or Ikusa).

My question: Which is the better game? Shogun or Wallenstein (the new updated 2nd edition)?

Preferences differ either over the game map (Wallenstein's Germany versus Shogun's Japan) or the theme (medieval Germany versus feudal Japan).

RATING: 7.5
For the first hour or so for this game, it is quite enjoyable and decent amount of strategy. The hidden action placements and assassin ninjas are fantastic. However, the game eventually drags beyond three hours at which point I feel I'm doing the same things over and over. This can give the game an autopilot effect, making it boring at times. Nevertheless, much better than Risk in my opinion.

RATING: 3
It is a fun game with nice mechanisms: Simultanous decisions, cube towers. It might take too long with people who can not decide fast but i had a lot of fun.

Update 2016: Reduced down to 3. I just don't see myself playing this under any circumstances ever again.

Received 17.3.08 as secret santa gift. Might as well say it: Reminds me of Risk. I haven't played Risk in a long time, and I think my memories are slightly golden in comparison to reality, but Shogun is probably what I THINK Risk was: a good game. Shogun also for me represents a borderland game: it is as far into the war gaming world I'll venture by own accord. Quite a lot of random elements (the tower is pretty nice) and events for a Euro, but it does not spin out of control. You are the shogun of your own success. Set-up takes a while with all the fiddly  cubes and cardboard chits. Final rating: 7.5

some great mechanics in this game. i wonder though if perhaps just a little too much was squeezed into this game. it runs a fraction too long for what it is. losing a province that you had marked for taxing war chests is a huge set back.

having a few more games under my belt i'm comfortable with the number of mechanics. and as for the war chest set back i mentioned, it is just another factor to way up during your planning phase. increased rating to 8

Shogun has hoodwinked boardgamers into thinking it is a game. It has done so by having all the same components of the standard boardgame, and by having many of the same problems of a boardgame like a long setup time with many fiddly bits and poorly laid out instructions where  important info is difficult to look up. 

The real problem with Shogun is the way the game limits the number of each available action and how they are chosen. Basically, all players do approximately the same number of all the same things each turn, the only variation being where each action takes place. The method of choosing each location is done by each player placing a card representing a province they own on a grid of each available action, once. No one is able to devote themselves to doing more of an action than the game permits, which makes play feel arbitrarily limited. This system both removes player's agency in the game and allows the now disinterested players to play completely on auto-pilot, choosing actions by just randomly placing their cards. Worse still, players on auto-pilot actually remain competition for the players still engaged in consciously choosing where their actions occur further highlighting how the arbitrary limitations of Shogun restrict player ability to do anything meaningful.

Even Shogun's famous cube tower lends itself to this auto-piloting as combat has been boiled down to taking either player's involved armies and chucking them down the tower with the winner being decided by whoever's cubes spill out at the bottom.

In effect, all players could randomly play their cards down every turn, and watch how Shogun plays out like some kind of machine with zero player involvement. This is not a game! It is a box of parts that looks like a game.

RATING: 8.5
Holy cow.  The only thing holding it back from a 10 is the chintzy little cardboard cut-outs for the buildings.  How could you, Queen?  How could you?

Oh, it shaved an extra $15 off the cost?  OK.

The gameplay is exactly as good as everyone else has remarked.  It's a Euro area-control programming fest what thinks it's a GMT wargame.  There's a ton to do, too little time to do it in, plenty of conflict and fairly well-rounded conflict at that, the last season means everything's still up for grabs so kingmaking is virtually impossible, a rebalanced map makes turtling extraordinarily difficult, and the whole thing ends right before it wears out its welcome.

You have to determine what territories are critical for your victory; and while there's a handful of no-brainers the rest are anyone's guess and will depend largely on your initial position and their build-outs.  All of this means that the replay value is very high: a ramped-up version of El Grande.  Plus, for me, the Japanese Samurai theme and history crushes that of the 100 Years War.

Three years later, and this gem is still seeing the table with an enthusiastic "Yes".  If we've got 2 hours to spend on a game-night, it's up for grabs.

RATING: 3
I would rate it 6 with three players and 1 with five. In a five-player game if you get weak in the beginning (after a weak or unfortunate initial setup others can take several of your provinces) you look ahead to a minimum of three hours (the game can easily last four) of boredom, you might as well just give up your remaining provinces and leave.
It is more difficult to get weak when played by three. The game is enjoyable, but people who don't like luck in their games, should avoid it. The source of most luck is a unique cube tower that retains some cubes that were thrown in it. The color majority of cubes that come out decides the winning player in a battle. It is a faster way to decide a battle than the dice method used in risk, and the probabilities are different.

It's language independent Wallenstein with slightly tighter rules. The auction for turn order and the accompanying action allows a bit more control. The board (now with a score track, but with out a place for action cards) is very nice and the fact it is double-sided is a bonus. I'm not sure if the map is better than Wallenstein, I have a feeling it might be, but will need more plays to be sure. Despite all this I probably won't buy it as I already own Wallenstein - probably.

E' il primo passo verso un mondo più ampio (parafrasando Star Wars) per gli amanti del Risiko! Shogun è infatti un risikone ma molto evoluto. Con questa premessa mi scuseranno gli amanti di questo gran gioco (tra i quali mi ci annovero) ma Shogun è un gioco di battaglia e conquista territori dove, dimenticando i dadi che poco si prestano ad un gioco di questa profondità, non manca un po' di alea con la presenza della torre misteriosa dove non sempre verranno restituiti gli effettivi valori d'armata utilizzati. Il gioco è un gioiello con regole non immediate ma perfette che trasformeranno la partita in una sfida d'intuito programmazione e scontri diretti. Le partite solitamente iniziano con un primo anno quasi fraterno, tranquillo per passare nella seconda stagione a battaglie epiche alla conquista di castelli e teatri. Secondo me un capolavoro!

RATING: 7
心得:
主要是賣互動的遊戲
10個行動多數可以平行處理
事件好像多數沒有幫助
錢一定會不夠所有要斟酌用
總共最多12場戰鬥
但是戰鬥骰塔隨機性太高
也讓遊戲策略度稍微下降
遊戲時間過長是個問題
而遊戲內的策略面又還好
主要應該還是個嘴砲的遊戲
規則:
*先根據挑選的版圖面跟玩家挑出對應的省份卡(3人部分區域不用)，每個玩家7個方塊+10個方塊丟到骰塔，掉下來的清空回各自供應區，事件卡洗勻開四張
*3/4/5人起始18/15/12元，每個人拿個人圖版對應大名卡跟顏色方塊還有寶箱卡，分數0，食物0
*每個人先用個人圖版背面把方塊對應數目分成不同群，之後省份卡洗勻開兩張，輪流由起始玩家開始拿走一張卡(二選一 或是牌庫頂，如果有重複可移到牌庫底開新的兩張)並放一群方塊到該省份，馬上補新的卡，直到每個人全部方塊都放完
*遊戲總共進行兩年八大輪，一大輪一季，春夏秋行動輪，冬天記分輪，行動輪有六個階段
1.行動卡洗勻隨機放在版圖下，前5張打開
2.特殊卡洗勻隨機放在五個順位格(結算先結算事件卡在結算特殊卡)
3.蓋著出牌在個人圖板上(11格，1格1張)決定哪個省份做哪個動作跟競標
>花3/2/1元蓋 城堡/寺廟/劇院，同個省份不能同樣建築物，建築數量每個省份不同
>省份根據牌徵米/稅，如果有暴動標記結算戰鬥，之後再放一個暴動標記
>花3/2/1元 放 5/3/1個兵，放1兵的動作同時可移動該省份的任意個兵到擁有的鄰近省份(至少留1，不能主動放棄自己占領的地)
>戰鬥 移動該省份的兵到附近沒人或他人的省份進行戰鬥結算
*錢牌出在行動格代表不做該行動，省份牌出在競標格代表0元，但是順位比0元前面
4.決定事件 剩下的開著的洗勻抽一張成為這回合事件
5.決定順位 依競標價格拿特數卡並放大名卡成為這回合順位依據，平手隨機抽大名卡決定順位
6.執行行動 10個行動依序執行，第1個執行時開第6個，同理直到所有行動照順位執行完，行動可以執行一定要執行，資源不夠就放棄，執行完進入下季，
*第四第八輪為冬天記分輪，先根據剩下的事件卡跟擁有的省份(每省1個)每個人需支付米，不夠付的根據表格由左手玩家抽省份卡執行暴動，放置農民方塊數為該省份上暴動標記數目加上表格上額外加的農民方塊，之後記分，之後抽新的4張事件卡，米歸0，暴動標記移除，第二次記分後，平手比錢
>每個省份1分，每個建築1分，每個大區域(總共5個)最多城堡/寺廟/劇院的拿3/2/1分，平手拿2/1/0分
*戰爭發生時，該省份所有方塊跟托盤所有方塊都會丟進骰塔中，掉下來的方塊只有相關戰爭的才會結算，攻擊方跟防守方相同數量方塊移回各自供應區，剩下的才放回該省份，如果有省份平手或農民獲勝，移除該省份上所有建築物跟暴動方塊，該省份成為中立區，贏家拿走對應省份卡
*PVP 防守方如果沒有暴動標記，落下的農民算是支援防守方，農民勝利時全部方塊移回供應區，沒參與戰鬥的方塊留在托盤
*打沒人地 防守方為一個農民方塊
*徵稅或米動亂 攻擊方為暴動標記數農民方塊
*冬季戰爭 根據付不出的米數查額外增加的農民數，還有該省區的暴動標記
***兩人變體規則***
*C1棕色黃色區不用(卡片移出遊戲)，海路縮減到綠>棕變成綠>紅，紫>黃變成紫>紅
*C2 綠色區不用Iyo, Tosa, Echigo, Mutsu, Kazusa, Awa-Boso也不用，Izu to Awa-Boso > Izu to Shimosa.Tajima to Kaga > Wakasa to Noto.  
*移除+1武力特殊卡
*C1每人起始18個寶箱，遊戲進行兩年
*C2每人起始24個寶箱，遊戲進行三年
*照正常規則宣告起始領地(多一個3顆的領地，所以一開始會有10個領地)
*預設領地  在隨機或照順序選一個放3顆
C1 : 
P 1: 5 – Iyo 4 – Wakasa 4 – Ise 3 – Bingo 3 – Hida 2 – Iwami 2 – Tajima 2 – Tosa 2 – Yamato 
P 2: 5 – Omi 4 – Bitchu 4 – Awa-Shikoku 3 – Aki 3 – Tamba 2 – Hoki 2 – Kii 2 – Mino 2 – Owari

*決定順位競標第一個先選一張特殊卡，在換另外一個人選，之後兩人在選一次並放大名卡決定下回合順位

My comments are the same as Wallenstein, the only real difference being that the shipping routes open up more surprises than you'd expect for the geography. With only 6 turns, expansion needs to be fast and brutal to obtain the riches you need to build and grow. I like the constraints placed upon you by the pre-programming, but it still falls into the multi-player beat-up issue where you'll win if you're left alone, and if everyone is conscious of keeping the playing field level, then it becomes a bit of a lottery in the last turn. And the luck of the cube-tower adds to the lottery feel. Solid and all, not just totally engaging.

This is a fantastic game. I looked around at many geeks' oppinions about it and there seemed to be a lot of debate about the kind of game this is. I don't really think that's important, you just play the game for what it is! And what the game is is high quality components mixed with a great set of rules that make this by far one of the best games in my collection. If I had to tell you what kindof game it is I'd say it is a medieval japanese set war logistics game. It's important that Japan is the set since in japanese culture the "honor" plays a large role. So battle is not all there is, in fact, bellic manouveres and assaults are fairly scars in this game, what players so is, on one hand trying to avoid defeat in case of an attack, by strategically placing their units, and at the same time rise buildings that ensure honor, thus points. This is mixed with the constant preasure of internal peasent revolts, due to tax and rice collection, needed to buy units and buildings and to feed the army. In all a very good game with a fair degree of complexity that does require some thinking ahead, good planing some strategic considerations. One of the very good ones to me!

- As always, Queen Games rulebook are rolemodel on how well rulebooks can be done. Makes the game look easy until you start playing and get aware of the many tough decisions, but luckilly, the rule book helped!

One play so far.  Not sure what to make of this game.  The rules are not too hard to learn.  However the strategy is where the thinking comes in.  The game is a cross between Agricola for feeding and turn mechanics and Risk (without the dice).  The tower is a unique way to determine battles and revolts.  Looking forward to getting another play or two before making a final judgement.  One warning.  Some players may take a lot longer to make decisions than others, once you play you'll know what part of the game I'm talking about.

If I had to give a prize to the best Board Game Design of a game that I've played then this game would win it. I am not very good at playing it; I fluked a win once, went mad on buying buildings the first year and through a series of lucky battle results in the second year managed to hang on by the skin of my teeth. Despite that I can't resist playing (even though it goes on longer than I normally would wish to play a game for), I just love watching the game unfold and the elegance of the design as each part interacts with the other parts of the game.

I really want to like this game, a mix between Agricola and Battlelore. However, the wargamer in me is offended to have a game with ninja and samurai that does not primarily involve killing.

This multiplayer wargame has basically the same rules as Wallenstein.  It involves pre-determining which actions to take (and where to take them) simultaneously at the start of every turn.  You earn a limited amount of money during the game, and have to determine whether to spend it on armies or on buildings, which earn you victory points but can be conquered by other players.  The dice found in most games of this type are replaced by a cube tower, which basically acts as a randomizer with memory, so if you get screwed one time, you'll be more likely to benefit later.  Unfortunately, the map in this game (unlike Wallenstein) encourages players to consolidate toward either end of the board, where many of their opponents will likely not even be able to attack them.  Oh, and I never really liked multiplayer wargames to begin with.

Exactly like Wallenstein but with a cooler theme. I definitely don't need both in my collection and the jury is still out on which map I like better. I did find it slightly easier to find locations on the German map, but Shogun wasn't too bad in that aspect. I'm not sure if I liked the money in Shogun, but I quite enjoyed everything else.

RATING: 9
Update: Played this more now and bumping it up to "9". I think part of my initially "weak" rating compared to Wallenstein was due to the game expericence with the players in the game: not everybody likes "Simultaneous Action Selection". Some think it gives a distant feel not beeing able to directly anwser opponents moves. Shogun/Wallenstein is highly strategical and not that tactical. My reservations to the theme/artwork remains, in this case I like W much better. 

Actually works as a 2-player game too, If you take another 6-7 regions out of play on top of those blocked in the 3-player game.

***

Strange - SHOGUN is a very good game but I thought that WALLENSTEIN was spectacular.

The rules are not that different. But the two sister-games feels different when playing.

I did not think that the bidding for turnorder brought that much to the party.

SHOGUN felt a lot more difficult to play. Maybe due to the - for me at least - new, and sometimes similar sounding japanese province names? I mixed up the provinces all the time. Also the provinces felt smaller, thus making it harder to see the cities when the provinces had a lot of armies on them. The types were clearer also in WALLENSTEIN. 

The peasant-rules were better in SHOGUN, but the artwork, the shape of the map, the events was better in WALLENSTEIN. Did feel that SHOGUN's pretty theme also felt a lot more generic than WALLENSTEIN's, it looks like the feudal japanese setting is fairly common (Samurai Sword, Samurai, Senji). It would have been interesting to have a short historic summary of the warlords on the individual payer boards.

This 8 feels very priliminary. I know SHOGUN "ought" to be better when I rated WALLENSTEIN a 10. I will of course give it some more plays, but I guess theme means a great deal to me.

 Great game. You need territory, but you need to build stuff, get rice, so you got to balance betwwen armies and buildings. Plus, the cube tower is a cool idea. I also like the idea that if you take resources from a province (money or rice) the farmers might rebel. Plus you get to bid on turn order. A lot of stuff going on.

Amazingly light for such a large game. After you get used to all the different types of cards (won't take long), you are done with learning.
And if somebody tells you that you should concentrate your manpower to a good area and start expanding from there... believe him.

There is a lot to do, but the main point is fighting - and that's where it goes wrong for me. I liked the cube-tower idea, but it just doesn't work. Throw cubes into a blocked tower and watch what comes out. Of course you can increase your probabilities but still, it's a bit useless imho. Well, okay, it's definitely better than any combat card system would've been.

Oh well, maybe I'll get used to the tower after playing more. I hope I do, because this game has possibilities to become eight. They've done good job capturing the Japanese world onto board.

Two years (six turns + two winters) seem short at first, but it's enough. At the end I hoped that it would be a bit shorter. Winter is really harsh and unpredictable. It can be either good or bad, depends.

I see eight coming, just give me more chances to play this!

A war-like game where the economics and planning are more important than the battles. And there is a cube tower for battles! 
Our 1st game saw a lot of fighting same as we do in any other warlike game. In the 2nd game people had learnt from where the most points come and we already saw a lot more building and protecting your strategic areas. It is expensive to make a lot of war, and if you have too many territories, the winter can become really harsh. But still there is always some heavy fighting, and especially in autumn just before scoring. 
GREAT game!

Interesting. The battle tower is often a riot, giving some pretty crazy results, sometimes. In a good way.

Lots of AP regarding turn orders, but the second-guessing, bluffing and area management is honestly really well done. Nothing to get crazy excited over, but if someone suggests this one, I would be hard-pressed to decline.

My biggest complaint is that 6 turns seems too few. But then, any longer than that, and the massive pockets of troops on the board would get out of hand.

RATING: 7
Quite unique game play as you manage the product and fighting abilities of your different provinces. You don't really feel safe anywhere on the board, which makes the game play feel quite tense. One of only a few games that uses the "cube tower" for combat resolution... an interesting idea. Actually works pretty well, but I'm not sure how I like it. Overall, a great game.

RATING: 8
As with Wallenstein:this is an excellent game that is just too short. There are only three turns per year (the fourth phase is a scoring phase) and only two years to play. I would love to see this go on for several more "years" as there is simply not enough time for any real empires to develop. In addition to that, the artificial limitation on attacking (only twice per turn) hampers the flow of the game.That said, this is a great game, even in this format. The 'moon' side of the map is the most difficult as the scoring areas appear to be designed for greater conflict.

In this game you get a hand of cards that match the areas you control. On your player board you have card slots that match the different actions that happen each round. During the preparation phase, you program those actions by placing the region cards on them, meaning the action will happen in the region you assign to the slot. The order of actions is randomized, and half of them are public knowlage at the start of the round. The rest get revealed as they happen. The game can feel complicated, but it flows smoothly as most of the actions can be resolved simultaneously. Combat is quick and interesting, as it involves dumping everyone's cubes into a tower and whomever has more spill out is the winner. The cost is that for every one of the defender's cubes that came out, the winner will also lose that many cubes. Cubes that retain in the tower will help you in your future battles. In this way you achieve a semi-random combat system, but the victum of this round's randomness has an advantage in future battles.

The one complaint about this game is the thing that makes it the most interesting. It feels like a dudes on the map game, on shuffle mode. You know where you want your actions to happen, but maybe someone takes that spot out from under you before it resolves. Maybe the order in which the actions happen makes it so that you can't afford the action you selected. Maybe the amount of grain needed to feed your spots at the end of the round is more than you planned for, and the peasants revolt causing you to lose spots. Maybe every combat you get into, both players tie and the spot gets wiped including the high value buildings you spent time making. I go back and forth being thrilled and frustrated.

Even though I have yet to win this game, as soon as I finish playing I start thinking about how I can change my strategy for next time.  The cube tower is wonderful, introducing an element somewhere between strategy and luck.  In these types of civ/fighting on a map games I like to have some luck, and the cube tower is much preferred to dice in my book.  The components are great, it's engaging, I can see this going to a 10 after a few more plays.

It's on the heavier side as far as Eurogames go, but on the lighter side for war games.  I find the game fun and rewarding.  The cube tower is great, as its more deterministic than dice in an interesting way.  If you do poorly in one battle, you'll do well in the next... probably.

1 play, 4 player, 3  hours

First time through the rules used up about 45 minutes. After that the game proceeds in a straight forward manner at a good pace. 

Of course, the tower is the most interesting mechanic in the game. The included bits work very well but I would have liked larger cubes for the buildings rather than counters.

Just like in the GameMaster series Shogun (Samurai), keeping the province cards sorted out and figuring out where they are on the map is the biggest pain. Perhaps a version set in the states (civil war contrived to 4 or 5 players) would address that.

A little bit better that Wallenstein, mostly through the bidding for turn order. Lots of room for thought to try to make the best of the Action Order while wary of the Event card to come AND the plans of the other players. Not too successful so far with this system but it seems to require building armies in the first half (and a few well shielded/profitable buildings) and conquering other provinces containing buildings in them during the second half. I need to be more aggressive and hope that no one forgets to truly ascertain who the leader really is.

I think this is really a 4-player game to avoid 2-on-1 situations. I also find the combined randomness of hidden-Action, the timing of the Events cards, and the Tower to be excessive. Play conservatively and get an average score (if you're lucky) or go for it and trust as much to luck as skill. This could easily slip down to a 6.

When given the choice between Risk and Shogun, it's Shogun EVERY time without hesitation.  I love the economic concepts in the game making it a much more comprehensive wargame than your standard move armies, kill armies, take territory.  The combat mechanic is clever and in my opinion THE best part of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
An excellent game of economic consideration and strategy. As well as taking offensive and defensive measures, one has to take into account that their shogun has to defend their lands through feeding peasants lest they stage uprisings through a lack of rice and from rival shoguns desiring to overrun their lands! The dice tower adds a random element to the game that leads to flucuations in luck and whenever you attack or defend take this into consideration as well as what armies lie near you. Ideal for 3-4 players in my experience with Shogun, but its playable with 5 players though it can get rather cramped and dont be surprised that one or two shoguns are reduced to almost nothing due to advancing armies of rival shoguns and diminishing luck in the dice tower!

A Feudal Japan themed Wallenstein. I love this game. I give it a slightly higher rating than Wallenstein due to the theme, although I think the Wallenstein map is a bit more fair as it makes it harder to defend. Geographically, Japan is easier to defend by land due to its shape. I can't wait to play this game again! The flaw I see with this game is that with only two scoring rounds, if you are behind by a lot after the first scoring round, it is very hard to get a win. You may end up playing kingmaker by focusing on the leader at that point.

Shogun is a nice game where battles are fought using the mysterious cube tower. The game lasts two years and each year has three rounds only.
The planning occurs on your own board and this is where you instruct your provinces to either harvest, tax, reenforce or attack other provinces.
Planning is a bit of a hassle and this reminded me a bit to Colonial: Europe's Empires Overseas with a big difference that I like Colonial a lot more. For my feeling this game plays a lot slower. The nicest is the surprises that the tower may reveal.

Plays like a wargame for Eurogamers.  10 secretly programmed actions, only being able to do one action per province per season, random action order and random event cards made me feel like I had a lot to think about without really having that many choices available.  Odd.  And unpleasant

But the cube tower was as cool as everyone's said and there is some fun in trying to optimally plan out which territories will take which action.  I also really liked the idea of peasant uprisings and maintaining an appropriately high rice stores.  I do wish the game wasn't quite so fiddly and encouraged combat more.

This is one of the best area control games I've had the pleasure of playing.   Normally I abhor randomness in long, thoughtful games but Shogun's cube tower is the perfect marriage between the unpredictability of war, and the determinism of strategic planning. 
The mechanic by which players program their actions is also a stroke of total genius. It's rare to find a game in which simply planning one's turn can be such a brain burning and brutal exercise.

It is also worth mentioning that this feels like an entirely different game at every player count, all of which are great.   At five people Shogun is a predictably frenetic free-for-all war game where players are constantly dancing around one another, hungrily expanding their borders by any means.
But at three, the game is a tense and calculative civilization builder.  Since more of the map is available, large empires quickly arise... but it is difficult to feed so many provinces. Players are quickly forced to weigh the benefits of expansionism against the need to protect themselves from against their own people.

Great game which seemed like a huge improvement to Risk, until you realize that not much really depends on how much territory you control.

A very good game based on the all-time classic Wallenstein. No, a complete revamp of Wallenstein.

I was afraid, that diplomacy and constant wars will seriously hurt this game, but the former is on a minimal, the later is on an acceptable level. And it's always thrilling, waiting for the cubes to roll out from the tower. Luck is sometimes a factor!

It certainly feels less like a war game and more like an empires struggle over a short reign.  Taxation, food storage and civic-revolt are very close to equal considerations to war fronts.  This is the lightest game I've played that incorporates these elements, and its done with superb design.

Good mix of warfare and building/administrating. Keeps all players involved at all times. Rarely bogs down, so despite feeling relatively complex and tactical it doesn't take an eternity to play through. Generally intuitive and fun. Medium-complexity strategy boardgaming at its best.

First play was as nuanced and engaging as I was hoping it would be. The battle tower is truly innovative and engaging for all players. On first glimpse it appears that this is a straight up conquer the world game, but there's much more going on here than that. I'm not going to rate it yet, as it definitely deserves more plays to truly expose the myriad of game levels going on. Really looking forward to my next plays!

I found this game very boring and its rules were very hard to understand. Once we had finished the game we went back and decided that we had played it wrong and that the designers had intended a different interpretation of the rules. I don't think I would play this one again. Although I did like the tower in concept but its use in reality is severely flawed.

Shogun is an interesting game that has information overload, king making, petty politics, and hand slapping. It's scoring system and intrinsic limitations on the size of each player's armies is the only thing keeping it from the trap all war games fall into. I wasn't angered by it, but I didn't think it was that good either.

RATING: 7
This is based on one play with four players, but wow - great game.  The difficulty in making plans based on when actions are going to occur, the uncertainty of the tower, and the need to balance forces are all key components.  Two things kept this from an eight for me: (1) length, it's a long game and I'm not sure it would get much shorter with more plays.  I'd play a long game like this from time to time, but I'm not going to say I'd never turn it down. (2) in my one play, I had a four point lead going into year two, and while I had a couple of weak provinces I expected to get taken, all three players continued to beat me down and then my only chance of breaking out (a 3 or 4 to 1 battle) was a spectacular defeat.  All of which meant I had little to do during year two, I'd definitely play again, but it made the second half of the game less enjoyable.  Great game.

(When rating games I focus on the "how likely I am to play this game again" part of the BGG description rating, as opposed to the "quality" part of the rating.)

This game was a big hit with my group and actually turned out to be a lot more fun than many of us thought it would be.  This game plays like a eurowargame.  The cube tower is a BLAST!  Highly random but adds great excitement to the battles.  Many strategic decisions to make which are great fun.  The best part is how streamlined the gameplay is.  At first glance you'd think it takes quite a long time to play, but the design is so sleek that it plays rather quickly even with the full five players.  Highly recommended.

RATING: 10
The best area control&strategy game I have played. The theme really fits here even though it's a euro. There are only two kind of attacks in this game: stupid and wise. You have to know when it's the right time to attack. You can't push your luck too hard or you have to pay the price. Careful planning is the key to victory. You must react fast to every move of your enemies. You have to know which of the provinces you need to defend and the provinces that aren't important to you. Cube tower adds memory to battles that your bad luck in one battle may very well change the odds in another battle. Faster, more fun and less luck depended in the long run than a set of dice. Probably some people try to blame the cube tower for their bad luck. Still in every game that I have played, the best player has won the game.

RATING: N/A
Based on the [gameid=3307] game system. The game is set in the Sengoku period (approx 1467-1573) which ends with the inception of the well-known Tokugawa Shogunate.  The game covers 2 years.  The rounds consist of Spring, Summer, Fall and then Winter is a scoring round each year.  There is a very limited amount of time to tax and build castles, temples, and theaters.  You must also feed your people and build up your armies to raid surrounding territories.  Watch out for the peasant revolts.  Includes a a Combat Tower!!  Each combatant gathers up all the army cubes involved, tosses them into the top of the tower.  Some will get stuck in the tower (waiting for future battles) and the rest will tumble out. The player with the most armies tumbling out wins the combat.  Not as random as rolling the bones, but just enough luck to keep it interesting.

RATING: 5
Promises more than it delivers. I sit down ready to engage in sweeping wars across the land, and instead plod along with nibbles here and there, watching territories swapped between players. Drier than most straight wargames, and shallower than more euros. Has the aspirations of being a great hybrid, but it's just kind of bleh. I can't think of a situation where I'd play this instead of, say, Struggle of Empires.

RATING: 7.72
Not really a territory conquest game based on the original Shogun (from which it stole the name, that game is now called Samurai Swords). This is actually a points scoring Euro based on majority control in various regions. However, it has a combat interaction. That combat interaction is what really makes the game. Not only is the combat element fairly clever but it also has the dice tower. This is a large column into which you drop cubes. Some cubes drop out, some become stuck and fall out at a future resolution. It randomises individual results while ensuring a relatively equitable long term position, and even permitting forward planning.

RATING: 7
We've had this game for a while - my wife got it very cheap (I think), along with a load of other Queen games, for kickstarting Urbanisation - but we only had our first play in November 2013. In fact, we abandoned it after only 1 of the 2 "years", but this was not through disliking the game. It was purely that it had taken us 2 hours (not that it felt like it was being so slow while playing), and we decided we wanted to play some other non-ridiculously-short games. We all agreed that we'd play it again some other time soon, now we have a better idea what we're doing. However, it was nearly a year later (October 2014) that we finally played our first (and so far only) full game.

Personally, I like most of the mechanics. The cube tower is funky and fun to use, although I don't think it's crucial to the game - more of a gimmick, as you could just decide the battles with dice instead (although then you wouldn't get the odd result of sometimes ending up with more cubes in a territory after the battle than you sent in in the first place!). The mechanics of blind bidding and blind action-selection seemed very interesting, quite unfamiliar-seeming but straightforward and providing interesting decisions. I can easily see why this is in the BGG top 100. However, I don't think it's a game that I'm ever going to personally request. My concerns are that the scoring seems very uninteresting in relation to the rest of the game (although I can see how it might lead to exciting games - you want to both control lots of territories and build lots of buildings, but if you spread too thinly you will lose some territories, and therefore some of the buildings which do nothing for you except during scoring rounds, with the exception of some of the event card effects), and I can see AP being a *huge* issue for experienced players, especially towards the end of the game.

Still a very interesting game though - quite unlike any others I know.

Achei um jogaço. 2 coisas me chamaram a atenção:

1. O mecanismo de resolver batalhas com a torre é genial. Muito divertido, imprevisível no ponto certo. Teve uma batalha épica entre Henrique e Santiago com 22 cubos sendo jogados na torre que chamamos até a Pati no quarto pra ver.

2. A resolução de ações é uma sacada muito boa tb. A cada turno, a gente sorteia em que ordem as dez ações vão acontecer, sendo que as 5 últimas vão sendo reveladas só depois. Vendo a ordem, vc define secretamente qual província sua vai fazer qual ação. A ordem é crucial, pois a ação de batalha pode rolar antes da de pegar reforços, ou as que gastam dinheiro antes da de pegar dinheiro. Tudo isso muda suas prioridades.

A pancadaria entre jogadores é relativamente light, pq se expandir muito custa muito caro, mas é importante não virar um alvo muito apetitoso para os outros.

O ponto negativo pra mim foi a resolução das revoltas. Como tem mais de um tipo de revolta, a regra é um pouco complicada, tinha que ficar sempre consultando o manual dependendo do caso. Outro ponto negativo (menor) é o setup chato.

A partida durou 3h30, mas éramos 5, todos jogando pela primeira vez. Acho que a próxima pode durar uma hora a menos fácil.

(+) Nice blend of bidding, action allocation and area control (possibility to build 3 type of buildings) resulting in an interesting war game
(+) Board gets more interesting as game progresses
(+) Interesting course of the game: if you invest heavily in certain area's they make for popular targets. This dynamic works very well

(-) It takes a long time to play Shogun
(-) Some luck-dependancy with the cube tower - still a lot better mechanism compared to simply rolling dice!
(-) It should have been possible to create a more functional design for the game board: the name of the provinces are hard to read (certainly upside down) and it would have been useful to indicate the value for coin and rice on the board.

The more I play this game the less I enjoy it. Blind planning that you are locked into executing no matter what happens between the time you planned it and when you actually must execute it. If it was simply blind planning, however, it would just be irritating. What makes it unforgivable is all of the chaos in the system that is impossible to foresee or account for during the planning phase. If the game were shorter this wouldn't be so bad but the game is long long long

It's a game that balances between conquest, supply and scoring VPs. It has limited number of turns, so it is mostly over in less then 2 hours.

Sort of a mix between El Grande and Game of Thrones.  The cube tower is awesome - far superior mechanic to standard dice rolling.  My main gripe is that I wish there were some way for players to select their actions without putting them face-down, either with a screen, Memoir 44-like card holders, something that would allow everyone to secretly select which province will take which action without constantly having to check what you put (or calculating exactly which ones going to go where before placing any of them down). Also, because there are quite a bit more unknowns when determining actions than AGoT for example (what's the possible order of actions, what's going to get attacked first, will I have enough money at the time each action occurs, what might the event card be and how should I optimally collect money or attack, how am I doing on rice), Shogun is more AP-prone.  The rice mechanic felt tacked on (no where near as good as the supply mechanic in AGoT) and unnecessary.  Lastly, I would like to see scoring after every turn or every two turns, rather than just twice in the game - that would make it more dynamic and provide players more focus on who is in the lead.  These are just some thoughts - it is still a very good game that I am happy to play, but I feel there are some clear ways in which it could be streamlined/improved.

Update: I liked this one more the 2nd time.  It can still be AP-prone but I can see this one speeding up to under 2 hours once we're all more familiar with it.  I understand better how the rice dynamic helps integrate the revolting farmers and make it more expensive to control lots of territory, but it's still feels clunky.  Looking forward to more plays, although I think I still prefer the elegance of El Grande (or Quebec), which really feels quite similar, minus the amazing cube tower.

Pretty artwork, components are fine but a pasted on theme. Alot of strategy until you realise any plans you make are entirely at the mercy of chance due to the hidden information, random bonuses/penalties/actions every turn and the cool (but random as fuck) cube tower. Way too random for a Euro game even if it is a Euro/War game. Was bored before the first year was over.

I love this game.  I really enjoy Wallenstein as well, but the asian theme for this one appeals more to me.  The cube tower is quite possibly the neatest bit in all of this hobby.  Some complain that this board is too narrow and not enough interaction among players happens, but I have realized after several plays now that unlike Wallenstein, this game's board encourages negotiation and teamwork.  The choices are painful as you try to decide which territory needs more men, and which one isn't going to get attacked tis turn.

Top notch!

Very few changes to Wallenstein. The special cards are a nice addition, the events are maybe a bit bland and don't affect the game as much as in Wallenstein. Also they are not region-specific as some cards in Wallenstein. Theme fits well and overall quality of art and components is good. After one play it feels that the shape of the map is maybe better in Wallenstein. In Shogun the map is very long and the two players who can secure positions at the far ends of the map have an advantage over others. In Wallenstein the map is of a better shape - more square and makes things more equal.

Dudes-on-a-map game where the main mechanic is programming your turn by assigning provinces to distinct actions without knowing the exact order in which the actions will occur, and over-taxing regions results in peasant revolts.  Combat is a tower where you physically dump in the armies, and whoever comes out fight to the death, with some getting stuck in the tower and stragglers from past fights wandering into the action, which is goofy, but it works, and long term you get back out what you put in.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The only difference between this and Wallenstein is that you "bid" for turn order. Instead of the 5 blank action cards, you get 1 blank, 1 with 1 gold on it, 1 with 2 gold on it, 3, and 4. When placing actions for that round, there is an extra spot on the map for you to place one of these cards (or a province card for a bid of .5) for turn order. Before the round starts, everyone reveals these, pays the amount to the bank, and whoever bid the highest chooses first, ties broken randomly.

The twist is, the turn order also gives you a special "power" for that round. There are 5 special power cards that are shuffled and placed on the turn order track, when you get to choose one (from the bidding mentioned earlier) you exchange your personal player card for the special power card, thus earning you a special power and a spot on the turn track. The special powers are:  1 Attack,  1 Defense,  1 Gold,  1 Rice,  1 Unit when completing the 3 for 5 action.

It really doesn't make a whole lot of difference in the game, but it does add a little something extra. Overall; same experience, same feeling, same strategies, same game.

Best with 3 as an economic game.

Shogun is an area control game wherein players gain points for provinces, buildings, and having a majority of a building type in a region.  The game goes through 2 years, with 4 seasons each, 2 seasons set aside as scoring rounds.  The other 6 seasons players each get 10 actions, varying from building, deploying new troops, gathering rice and money, and attacking.  Players assign a province to an action, and a province can only act once per season, this causes players to carefully consider what they want to do each round, and what you think your opponents will do.  The order of the 10 actions is randomized each season, and only 5 are revealed during the planing phase.  Each season also has an event card with it which is revealed after players decide their turn, and this can radically change who can be attacked, how much food or taxes you can collect, and other modifiers.

The game is not a total-domination warfare game as players do have to supply their provinces with food during the scoring round or risk a farmer revolt, which could cause the province and all its buildings to be lost.  So players must keep their expansionism in check.  Also, farmers will revolt if you take food and/or taxes from them more than once per year, and since each province gives out a different value of food and money players have to carefully consider how to fund their war while keeping the farmers from revolting, or having enough army presence to put down a revolt.

Battles are accomplished via a cube tower in which the cubes are place in the top and some come out while others stay in.  The game is pre-seeded with 7 armies from each player and 10 farmers, so battles are somewhat random, adding tension.  A smaller force can defeat a larger force, and a player can end up with more armies than they started with.  This allows for some level of chance and keeps the battles interesting as the outcome is never known ahead of time.

RATING: 9
One of my all-time favorites. Easy to learn, but requires considerable thinking for solving the puzzle of assigning orders to provinces each turn. As most action programming games, there's a lot of double-guessing the plans of your opponents. The luck is there and it is possible to lose because of bad battle results against the odds, but the dice-tower does a good job of evening it out and good play is much more important.

Because initial position is of paramount importance, I always pick between three face-up cards instead of two during the set-up: it still makes for a different game each time, but in practice eliminates the problem of drawing particularily unlucky positions, while at the same time making it harder to attain exclusive ownership of a region, resulting in even chances for everybody.

I very much liked Wallenstein, I like this more - for the theme and for the extra elements which are all better (at least than 1st ed Wally). The map more prone to turtling, or to a player benefitting inordinately from a passive neighbour? Well, maybe a tad, although really that is a general weakness of both games, and I suspect it is only ever so slightly exaggurated in this edition. Players who are well matched, and who either all play competitively or all be happy to do their own thing should not have any issues. I do understand the feeling that the theme (and the awesome battle tower) deserve more conflict dammit, but I don't know if that could ever be the same game, and this is a satisfying game. See Samurai & Katana for the theme with an appropriate level of bloodshed, negotiation and betrayal.

Lots of things to compute and think about. So it is a rather quiet game during the planning phase. The tower is a good mechanic to resolve combat rather than roll a die for every army. Really beautiful components. Recommended to any strategy-fan.

The new turn order system is a big improvement over Wallenstein. I prefer the familiarity of the German map, but the shape of the Japanese boards does assist in differentiating this from its predecessor. There's still the wild swings from the dice tower and multiplayer wargame issue of two or three fighting against one, but it's all part of the fun and even if you're getting hammered the choices are interesting and the ride is wild.

This is a difficult game to rate.  It is sure a nice one, with great components and a lot of new and clever mechanics, but, at the same time, it has too much administration matters and a very long lenght that just restricts me to give it a better rating.  Besides, there are some other wary multiplayer games with some resource management of the same weight and feel that I probably pull out first if I'm on the mood for one, like [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/19600]Antike[/url][/i], [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/9625]Struggle of Empires[/url][/i], [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/24181]Imperial[/url][/i], [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/6472]A Game of Thrones[/url][/i] and [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/6707]Age of Mythology[/url][/i], among others.  By the other hand, the theme, that is the Far East, is not too atractive for me, and the game could suffer of a beat-on-the-leader syndrome that may cause some kingmaker situations.

Interesting mechanisms, selecting which region to receive which action (though that can be prone to AP) and the combat tower substitute for dice rolling, especially with the ability for the "pips" to be modified by cards and/or the cubes previously stuck in the tower that are later knocked free.

Some of the board's regional colours are horrible for my colour-blind friends.

A very nice game with some meat on its bones. It does run a little long, so I don't see it coming out more than a few times a year. I think the auction for play order gives this game a slight edge over Wallenstein, plus it is easier to convince players to play since it is all language independent.

I had originally feared that wooden cubes were for pussies. Only thing that was a pussy in Shogun was me when attack showed up before taxation, as I trembled at the prospect of hungry enemies taking apart my regions before I could exploit them. This is a mean, nasty game for [u]real men[/u].

It's Risk for adults. You have to watch how far you stretch yourself, because you don't just have to deal with retaliations, but also with upkeep and possible revolts. You have to watch out if you build VP-generating castles, because that's just disturbing that hornet's nest of other players. You have to watch the order the actions come up and plan ALL 11 actions carefully, lest that cutting off of your supply handicaps you for the rest of the year (half of the game).

And conflict is delicious, courtesy of the cube tower. The way it works makes you feel consoled if a battle tips its favor against you, because you know the odds will favor you in future battles. It's just a great no-hassle way to resolve combat, without pointing fingers and mistakenly thinking that it's just an unlucky day for you. I love conflict in games, but Shogun makes me shit-ass scared of them because of the simultaneous orders. Tension is high, and players get pissed! This is what multiplayer conflict is about!

This is an 8 after one play, though I suspect it could go higher. The drawbacks that restrain me are the inherent headache with planning 11 actions at once (analysis paralysis and getting caught in shitty situations which you could admittedly avoid), and there are A LOT of things to take into account of so I don't know if I should just go with my gut feeling, or plan for everything and fail. I really wish that each region had its vital statistics printed on the map in addition to being on the cards and player aid.

Right now, if I want to spend 2-3 hours kicking some ass with people and getting a satisfying headache in the process, I will play Shogun. The game is satisfying, because the board changes so much, whole armies vanquish or disappear, and it's amazing to see how the castles and temples direct all the action like an inept traffic controller (since it leads all armies to collide in one nuclear explosion). I believe that given time and more plays, Shogun will be my ass-kicking game of choice.

[u]UPDATE[/u]: The really disappointing thing is Shogun takes far too long with newbies, especially for a game with this much chaos. Sorely needs a timer, which could create more mistakes that make the game more fun. Really don't want to play this with AP-prone people. Have to try it with 3.

A little too chaotic for a 3-hour game.

One of my favorites!  Oozes theme and has management on the fly as sometimes the actions you want to do aren't coming out in the right order and you almost never have enough money to do everything you want.  The cube tower might be a little "gimmicky", but it resolves combat in a tenser way than the usual dice rolling.  Improving a province gets you points, but makes it a more inviting target.  You have to have the right mix of people or it can really bog down.  Top-notch in every way and one that I will NEVER turn down!

The game just does not have enough turns.  Would be much better if played over the course of 3 years instead of 2 I think.  I also do not like the mechanic where you have to assign all 10 actions at the beginning of each season.  The game would move along smoother if you only had to choose the next territory that you would take an action in.  This would prevent "analysis paralysis" that I have seen with some players while they try to figure out which territory to use for all of the 10 actions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Shogun -- Played once; four-player.  

The variable phase order and the players' foreknowledge of only the first phases when they plan their actions, make for interesting game flow. 

The tower mechanism is really cool.  While it seems limited to conflict-based uses, I can imagine game designers working this mechanism into new games, as it provides a more balanced randomness than dice.  

It seems to me that Shogun's primary thrust is area control.  So it seems odd that there are so few opportunities to invade others' territories -- two attack actions per season, for six seasons, for a total of twelve opportunities in all.  If area control was simply one among many strategies in Shogun, then the dearth of invasion actions might be understandable.  But that's simply not the case -- area control is at the heart of the game.   

In the end, despite the really cool tower, we won't be purchasing Shogun.  There are a number of other area-control games I'd rather play.

Look, I understand that when some idiot steals a key province despite sending four cubes against your five (plus green), and then you fail to win a key province later despite sending eight cubes against four (without green), is all part of the game - but life sucks bad enough as it is to willingly subject yourself to this crap.

RATING: 5.6
It got a little better once we started playing with the correct rules -- though finding them out from that rule booklet is an art in itself.

Still has a number of flaws, though, especially that the number of actions you have does not correlate much to the number of provinces you have, while your expenses do. I.e., no matter how many provinces you have, you always have only one rice harvesting action -- but you need to feed all provinces.

The fighting system is debatable.

As a huge Nobunaga's Ambition and Inindo fan from the NES and SNES, I love this theme and mechanics.  I'm still working on improving my tactics in an effort to win more often.

Although it has wargame elements, it definitely has very Eurogame-like mechanics.  If you can claim territories with useful buildings right before scoring or eliminate a province that an opponent was going to tax or collect rice from before they can, you definitely give yourself an advantage.

Area Control, Territorial Conquest, Building. Great first play with 5p. Lots of decisions and resources to manage, not least of which involving the actions of your opponents. Wargamey without being a wargame. Seems like it might be hard to come back if you're too far behind after the first scoring, but then, most games are like that; repeated plays will see.

I like Shogun. A friend dubbed it "Risk on acid", but the resemblance to Risk is fairly specious. Shogun is an excellent strategic game of conflict, however, which also does an outstanding job of incorporating role selection, blind bidding, bluffing, and even negotiation - to some degree. At least, Shogun allows for negotiation. I wouldn't say the game design promotes it. Some have remarked that playing the two years (six actual full turns and two scoring turns) does not allow the game to develop as fully as players would like. And I agree that going for three or four years would provide an interesting experience. The problem with this is simply a matter of time. After playing a one year trial game, our first full game still took four hours. I would say that the players were neither exceptionally fast nor slow, but average with respect to play time. It didn't *seem* like four hours to me, but that is because there is very little down time in Shogun, were you are just twiddling your thumbs. The time-consuming part of the game is the act of secretly matching up your provinces with the 10 actions which occur every turn. Some might call this downtime, but it's really sort of a mutual brain melt. Each player is examining the board, assessing the possible events for the season, the five revealed actions, and their own position - trying to figure out the most advantageous way to appropriate the actions. This takes time, as so much rides upon the decisions made.

The one thing I dislike about Shogun is that the weight given to this process of matching roles to provinces is disproportionate to the amount of planned strategic impact which results from the process. What you end up doing, and when, and where - IS THE GAME. But because the process is blind, and because you only see the order of the first five action types for the season, you have to spend a lot of time speculating as to what your opponents are doing in order to decided what you are going to do (and when and where during the season). This all has a tremendous impact on the game, and everyone knows it, which is why making the choices take so long, and why the entire game ends up taking 3  hours. But it feels to me as if there is a disconnect between investment and outcome. I think simplifying this process would have improved the game - perhaps reducing the number of roles/phases down to five somehow. This is my only gripe with the game (besides the warping player mats.)

The cube tower is used to resolve combat - you can see pictures of it here. I think it works quite nicely, and helps generate tension as mild surprises can occur. You aren't merely attacking provinces in Shogun. In fact, I would say that the heart of the game is not attacking (although that may be the most *fun*), but rather positioning and strategic building. Turn order (along with a special season-specific privilege) is determined by a blind bidding process. It makes sense. Shogun is a lot of fun, but it does seem to me to be a more contemplative, slower paced game. As with many, I prefer the Moon side of the board. I recommend the game, but make sure you don't mind longer games, and that you set aside adequate time to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The game system, as far as I'm concerned, is Wallenstein perfected: I can't think of a more perfect game in the Risk-like conquest genre.  You can't just plunder your competitors: you must FEED and GARRISON your territory just to protect it from your own citizens!  More subtly, you must spread your holdings out to make the most points, penalizing those who content themselves with an invincible little corner of the board.  Folks, it doesn't get any better than this!  The only downside is that the cards and cubes like to slip and skid on the board, making it a bit tricky to handle.

[Essen 2006] 
A beautiful game, both in production quality and execution. (I have never played Wallenstein, but I know this is a re-themed version of that game). I played half a 5-player game (30 mins rules explaination, 2 hours 15 mins to play one (of two) game years -- for a total of 2h45m) before we decided to call it (well, it was 2:30am by then), but I just love how everything plays out. Rating this a 9.5, but I think this game would easily make a 10 in my collection with more (and complete) plays.

Highly recommended.

Update: I've now played full 5-player and 3-player games. This is an excellent game and is now awarded a 10 rating from me. The 5-player game took around 4 hours. The 3-player took 3 hours. Just a great experience -- careful planning required at the beginning of each season. Knowing when not to attack is just as important as knowing when and where to attack. I've also learned to appreciate the "small reinforce/redeploy" action more, when it can be coordinated with a "battle" action.

[2010-09-09]
Egyedi mechanizmusú harcot, gyűjtögetést és építést is magába foglaló komplex játék. Külön érdekességét a kockák helyett kitalált torony adja. Népszerűségét és magas értékelését az adja, hogy a szabályai nem túl bonyolultak mégis egyaránt megadja egy harci és egy gyűjtögetős, építgetős játék élményét. Ezen felül a 12 lehetőség körönként, a játékossorrend meghatározása, különböző előnykártyák választása, a lázadások lehetősége, mind-mind kimondottan érdekessé teszik a játékot. A nagy, két különböző felosztású pálya növeli az újrajátszhatóságát. Gémereknek és nem gémereknek is bátran ajánlható játék.

[2011-06-16]
Sajnos muszáj csökkentenem a pontszámon, mert a 4 játék alatt nagyon kijött, hogy a játékban nem csak a kockatorony a szerencsefaktor. Egy ilyen komolynak kinéző játéknál már sok ez a szerencse. Továbbra is jó játéknak tartom, amit sokfajta emberrel ki lehet próbálni.
9->7

[2012-05-05]
Amit még negatívumként lehet említeni, hogy elsőként játszva elég nehéz lehet a szabály és játék kimondottan hosszúra nyúlhat. Illetve megvan a királycsinálás effektus lehetősége is. Tehát sok a szerencsefaktor, de igazán izgalmas játék.

[2017-08-28]
Sajnos minél többet játszom a játékkal annál kevésbé tetszik és mostani utolsó játékom után meg is érett az eladásra. A játékban óriási szerencsefaktor és brutálisan hosszú a játékidő. Már a kezdeti toronyfeltöltéskor kerülhet egy játékos sokkal jobb helyzetbe, mint a másik. A csatákban a döntetlen esetén a semlegessé váló tartomány több kör munkáját teszi tönkre. Játékostársam ajánlása, hogy csatakor csak a seregek felét dobjuk a toronyba, mert az némi kompenzálása lenne a szerencsének. De a szerencse a lázadó tartományok véletlenszerűségénél is jelen van, de a legjobban a kezdeti terület elhelyezkedéseknél. Hiába a draftolás, így is simán elképzelhető sokkal jobb pozícióból kezdő fél. Meglep, hogy a BGG társadalom a minél nagyobb játékosszámot ajánlja, megítélésem szerint pont 4-en, 5-en nagyobb a szerencsefaktor, talán 3-an még lehet vele jót játszani. Sajnálom ezt a játékot, de ez így nem élvezhető.

Even with the far superior turn order / special advantage auction, the map is so irritating that there is no way that I'd ever want to play this over the brilliant Wallenstein.  In Wallenstein, when you get an edge you certainly have an advantage, but here because the map is long and skinny you can isolate entire regions creating serious difficulties for those that might want to spread out a bit while the isolator has no real worries.  The random set up doesn't help either.

That said, I will take the cool parts out of this and transfer them into my blessed copy.

I have no desire to play this version again.

UPDATE: Yet again, I played this and ran into the same problem.  This time I told everyone what I was doing ahead of time to make the game more exciting and still won.

It looks like Risk.  OK, so imagine Risk.  Oh, but add an evil tower that eats your armies, impossible action decisions each turn, crippling attrition, never enough funds to raise more troops, and peasant uprisings if you can't feed them.  Which is, like, always.  Remember, the tower hates you.  So if you play like it's Risk, you will lose.  Oh, who are you kidding, you'll probably lose anyway.

Excellent game.  This is kinda area control and kinda wargame.  There's a small auction to see who gets what bonus and which order each player does their actions.  The balance between having enough money to build enough buildings, enough rice to prevent revolts, and enough armies to hold on (or expand) your territory is very good and makes for some interesting decisions.  Programming which action is done in each region at the satrt of a turn is not only enjoyable for having to plan ahead, but also speeds up game play such that there is not much downtime.

I wish Shogun were more of a war game and less of a euro. The battle tower is the best part of the game, yet it's not often useful. Even so, there's no denying what Shogun does well. I just wish it had more conflict. Conflict is so tantalizingly well done. Why the designer didn't do more to encourage it is beyond me.

I'm a sucker for Risk and it reminds me of it in many ways.  Of course, Shogun also includes economics and building and the dice tower helps resolves battles much faster than good old dice rolling.  Also, in Shogun you can still load up armies on a particular area, but you can't sweep through a bunch of territories on a single turn, an aspect I haven't decided if I like more or less.  Since I got absolutely annihilated in my first game, I definitely want to test the waters again.

Very heavy game, nice mechanics and I love the tower. Very clever. 
It could go bigger than 8. Let's wait and see how it goes for the next plays.

edit
A big disapointment. After a few plays I've discovered that this game has too much randomness attached to it and I don't like it. It's not that I don't like randomness at all, but in some games I (personal opinion) find it to be too unbalanced and unfair which is the case of Shogun. I would play it a couple of times a year if in the right mood.

Shogun is a cleverly designed and truly innovate war game, based upon the recipe from Wallenstein (only moved from Germany to Japan). In the game, players take control of a clan of samurais that are fighting for control over Japan. This is done through moving troops, harvesting resources and, hopefully, winning wars against one's opponents. 

What makes this game (these games) innovative is it's action selection mechanism and it war system.

Each round consists of ten actions (in random order), and players are secretly selecting in which areas of the map they want to conduct each of them. As such, the game is won by outmaneuvering one's opponent by swing through their plans and chose actions that them from being fulfilled. Wars, on the other hand, is determined by throwing cubes (representing armies) into a cube tower, which will determine it's outcome.

RATING: 8
I thought this was a wargame; until I played it.  It is a Euro with conflict pure and simple.  The cube tower is awesome; by simply dropping cubes in the tower battles are won and lost, casualties are assessed, and the tower is seeded for future endeavors.  Te "fairness" of the system becomes evident as poor performance in one battle is often rewarded later.  Kudos to the designer on that one.  The rest of the game is a funny little exercise in balancing production of food and gold evenly to prevent uprisings.  The area control mechanic encourages aggression but the Euro shows its colors by awarding VP's based on control of temples, theatres and castles that players can build.  A solid game I would readily play and recommend.

Played both this and Wallenstein once. Since they're basically the same, I'll leave the same comment and rating for both.

This is a long game, with lots of repetition each turn, but I still like it. There's a good balance between conflict and building stuff to generate VP. You really can't ignore either; what's the right mix depends greatly on other players' actions, and your response to them. So strategies should be flexible, but still a bit focussed. Hope to see the game length reduce with further plays, as I would really like to play this more often.

You know, I was kind of expecting more out of this game.  And on my first play-through I was quite impressed with all the different elements that were coming together to create the game (not to mention all the very nice physical components and the famous and oh-so-brilliant cube tower).  But after a couple of games, I found myself feeling like Shogun was fairly linear and fairly static, and that I was very much at the mercy of luck for much of it.  I found it to be linear because the order of events and the specific special events are decided for you each turn.  At times, rather than me playing the game, it felt like the game was playing me.  I found it to be static because there is simply not enough time in a game to build up some armies, march them across the board, and launch some surprise attacks on your opponents.  The luck elements could probably be reduced by showing the order of all 10 actions and the special event for the season before making your action selections, although some people might enjoy keeping these a surprise.  For the medieval Japan theme, I still much prefer the old classic "Shogun" (AKA "Samurai Swords").  All that being said, I do enjoy this game and I find myself wondering if there is more depth of strategy than first meets the eye.  I guess I'll just have to play it a few more times to find out.  Also, because my wife enjoys this game so much, I've gone to considerable effort to put together a very playable and very customizable 2-player version: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/322141.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 7.5/10

Great game!  Lots to think about, tense planning.  The cube tower makes for some big upsets, but it doesn't feel unfair, and throwing fistfuls of cubes into the tower is just fun!  It's just the right length for the meatiness.

Interesting game. Have not played it so much since it is a "wargame". It has a strange battlemechanic (the tower) which is impossible to analyse, and can move armies around in a very unlogical way. What's wrong with good old dice??

Played once, and we played the revolts completely wrong.  Rating based on that play, and it could go up quite a bit.  My main problem with the game is the attrition based combat, which really rewards players who wait to pounce on weakened provinces.  Not a fan of that mechanic.  If I were to play a multiplayer wargame with building/attacking and attrition based combat, I would MUCH rather play Imperial.  Update:  played again, correctly and with 3 players and I enjoyed it a lot.  I think I need one more play to firm up my rating.

[2 plays] Initial reaction rating.  The first time I played this game it was on of the best gameing experiences I had had in a while.  The game was super tight and had a great down to the wire finish between all five player.  Most of the players were first-time players, everyone caught on to the rules easily.  This experience led me to purchase this game.  I am usually not a big wargame fan, but this one just really worked well and was a lot of fun for me.  Having played it again, I still really enjoy this game and like it.  My gaming group is not quite as high on it.  The cube tower combat system gets very mixed reviews from my group.

As far as I'm concerned, this is "Cube Tower: The Game." I didn't care about much else in the experience; it's a fairly straightforward resource-gathering meets Risk experience. Not to say that it's not good, I think there's a lot of strategy in this and a good mix of randomness with hidden information, bluffing, and careful forethought. But it, overall, wasn't my cup of tea; I frankly suck at Risk and all games like it, and I don't have much of an investment in feudal Japan, so the theme didn't do anything for me. But the cube tower is quite possibly one of the coolest game gimmicks ever. We were having huge battles just for the pure joy of dumping giant numbers of cubes in that thing and watching what happened. I would probably play this again, just to play with the tower. So, well done to whoever though that one up.

1st play with 4 players and what a great game. It did take c.4 hours but this included a rules explanation of which all were noobs. Throughout the game, due to the number of steps within each round, I found myself constantly checking I was doing it right but the game is very intuitive and everything makes thematic sense as well.The game is involving at every point bar the action and bid selection process which will see the most amount of downtime whilst players choose their actions. Love the turn order bidding, the way the 1st five actions will reveal themselves and dictate the order of play with the remaining 5 still being an unknown. The game demands more players and plays!

RATING: 9
An excellent Euro that contains that rarest of features in such games - direct conflict. The battle system, which involves dropping cubes representing army units into a tower and seeing how many drop out of the bottom, may appear to be gimmicky at first but in actual fact works very well and is a refreshing alternative to rolling dice to determine conflict results. I also like the fact that each turn you have 10 actions you can perform and all players decide in which regions these will take place in simultaneously. This means that Shogun stands apart from other area control/conflict games because you don't have attritional situations with players placing all their pieces in one area which often prevents the game from progressing. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
A dry euro, you don't feel the Japanese daimyo rivalization theme at all. But the most important, it's really too random for a game of such a calibre. You are making your decisions before knowing the turn order, before knowing the order of your own orders and before knowing the event for the season. More, the mechanics of choosing the actions simultaneously is not working well here (I prefer how it is done in e.g. Dungeon Lords, despite some weaknesses of this game). It takes too long (10 actions to allocate) and you have too scarce info when deciding. Not for me.

Number of plays: 1.

Analytical game of programming your moves and crossing your fingers that you get to take certain actions first.  It's an area control game but the war overtones are very strong no matter how Euro it may be presented as.  The players must understand what the end goals are or else it is very confusing to understand why you are planning your actions. After the first winter (and first scoring) all players will know what is going on for sure.  After initial set up it flows very smoothly.

A beautifully crafted area control game (it's not a wargame!). I've had a game take 4 hours inc. teaching 2 newbies but it was completely worth it. It usually clocks in around 2 hours.

Stunning, I love the tower mechanism to resolve wars and this has worked it's way right to the top of my 'Want in Trade' list.

It is dangerous to be in first place at the end of year one as that player almost always gets wiped out. Beyond that frustrating wrinkle, it's a great game.

Update: The board is annoying in that those on the fringes are all but guaranteed to win. Those stuck in the middle are doomed to have two or three fronts at all times. The recommended set-up dooms player 5, I think. The (new) Wallenstein map is much better.

Unsurprisingly, the game does also suffer from the AT requirement of having the players balance it; if a player is doing badly, he can be eliminated by another player.

Rating down from an 8 to a 7.

Recieved as a gift from Nato, Kate, Conrad and Henrik.

Suffers from the same problems I think that Wallenstein suffers from.  It is a fun game, but it takes a long time, and there aren't very many turns to accomplish anything.  And just when you start to get some territories changing hands or lines starting to form.  The game ends.

This one is a little better than Wallenstein though with the special abilities and the turn order auction.

Glacial for a Euro. Inelegant. The confusion of turn sequencing, the low number of turns, and the uncertainty of the cube tower prevent long term planning. My impression is that Risk with the cube tower would come out as a better game: all the building, food and tax gathering, and peasant revolts just slow the game--and they prevent the cube tower from being used enough to balance out.

Fab! Been wanting to get this to the table for a couple of years. Finally managed it and well worth teh wait. Ostensibly and Area Control game but actually with very restricted attacks mean it's resource and action driven with area control picking up the VP's. Very tight combination of mechanics, and considering the type of game it is the famous battle tower was a risk to include such a seemingly large element of chance. But it's great and more calculable than mere dice.
Can't possibly wait another two years to play this again!

OK, let me get my quibbles out of the way first. The cube tower can be horribly frustrating when hordes of revolting farmers wait until your turn to hurl themselves from the cube tower, randomly obliterating your army and province while everyone else skates free and laughs. And Shogun, like many area-control games, has a ton of bash-the-leader and king-maker opportunities - eventualities, really - which both are typically turn-offs for me. But ... so many other things shine here that the quibbles are no more than that: minor chinks in the armor of a champion. Every action is critical in Shogun, and each action/province assignment is an agonizingly, wonderfully difficult decision. Strong planning, strategy and tactics are all rewarded. Shogun is deep, but also does not overstay its welcome in terms of game length. Best of all, while being deep and challenging, Shogun has some real historical flavor and a high fun factor. Perhaps not perfect, but certainly one of the best Euro war/area control games out there!

Not a big fan of this game.  But I know people that love it so I'll give it a 6.  I like games with simple mechanics and subtle strategies.  This game, I feel, has very complicated mechanics and planning each round is tortuous for me.  I really suck at this game and don't really enjoy playing.  I just recently gave it another try and was reminded why it had been so long.

This is definitely a "screw your neighbor game" because players commonly attack each other.  That is why so many people compare this with Risk but it's really nothing like Risk.  Risk is all about attacking each other non-stop with the goal of world domination.  This game is really more about maximizing victory points and trying to minimize the risks of losing important provinces to other players.

I just have a real tough time with this game.  The planning period of each round, I find to be the epitome of "analysis paralysis".  Not my cup of tea at all.

First of all I love the theme.  Second I love how you have to make strategic decisions without knowing exactly which order they will be processed in.  A buddy likened it to the orders being sent out from the headquarters to the front line...you just don't necessarily know which field commander is going to get their orders when...thus they may act out of your intended sequence.  It's an interesting dynamic, and the cube tower is also fun...you just never quite know what is going to come out.

My expectations of Shogun were completely different from what the game delivers.  I expected a game of conquest: rife with conflict and brimming with plans gone awry in the fog of war.  Instead, Shogun is a game of building: it discourages conflict and the primitive planning options are compartmentalized.  It's just not what I wanted it to be.

Basically, it's Wallenstein with a different shaped map and a handful of other mild differences.

Both are games that I respect more than enjoy, but I respect them greatly because of their clever and succinct designs.  For some reason, though, neither game achieves the tension and drama that I think they should.  I think a sand timer (ala Roborally) would help a lot.

This game has good "genes" to begin with. Wallenstein, though somewhat aged, is one of the most innovative games in the genre. That innovative even I haven't seen its mechanics being reiterated in another game. Really, the Dice tower and the altering action sequence partly hidden and partly known are two unique features I haven't seen adapted in other boardgames. On top, the reimplementation has awesome graphics but it lacks the history almanach that Wallenstein had included. A little disappointment there but nothing too serious. What I didn't like so much is an issue I see with every game that includes a considerable chunk of confrontational nature.It's just not made to be played with 3, even though the game's still fun! Too much "Crush the middle"-effect. Even more so with a "corridorous" map such as this. But again, I'd love to play again with 4 or 5!

If you remember that this game is not about war, but more about vigilance, this game is fantastic.  If you go into it wanting to wage full scale assaults, smash your buddies, etc it will fail miserably.  I personally love the game, I think it delivers on so many deep levels (pseudo-civ, area-control, etc.).

RATING: 6
Not a bad game overall. I like the variable phase order and the way you play hidden cards.

The area control part is just not very good. You can only attack with two different armies each round, and you can't increase an army and attack with them in the same round. This is an intentional limitation but it really feels too limiting. It also ensures that games will ususually play out the same way, with people spending the first few rounds building up their armies then attacking weaker areas later in the game.

For me, Chaos in the Old World is a much better, much more fun game. Eight-Minute Empire: Legends is also a better game with a similar feel if you only have three or four players, although on a smaller scale.

Overall, this (and Wallenstein, of course) is a well-designed game. Each round you have 10 possible actions, assigning, at most, 1 province to each, which makes for some difficult choices.

The real hero though for this game is the combat tower. I know it has some critics out there, but it's just fun.

Though while I enjoy this game, I don't see it hitting the table often due to its length. It took us almost 3 hours, not including the rules explanation or drafting (which we skipped). I see that time coming down a little bit, but not a lot. The only drag on time was the planning phase, and while some players took longer than others, no one seemed to take an unreasonable amount of time. It's just a long game.

Also, there's a considerable amount of chaos created by the seasonal events, random action order (the last half being hidden), and occasional loss of actions due to battle losses. I think these work well for a game designed to have conflict, but I personally prefer less chaos when a game is this long.

I like all of the tweaks that this gives to Wallenstein, except that I'm a sucker for the German map of the original.  Makes you want to reconfigure the harvest numbers in Wally and add in the extra elements from Shogun.

The cube tower is totally fun, but fools people into thinking this is a battle game, when there is so much more to it.  A fantastic balance of many mechanisms.

Shogun/Wallenstein is a flawless piece of game design.  Every time I play it I find myself wanting to set it up and play again.  It's a game I'd like to play several times in a month at some point.  If you have 4/5 players it's fantastic and the battle tower is a great, fresh alternative to some D6 rolls.

If you prefer Japanese theme get Shogun, otherwise the 2nd Ed. Wallenstein is better value as it comes with the expansion.  Shogun's expansion is overpriced and sold separately.

A great, fun game.  I think this implementation improves on a couple of things over its predecessor Wallenstein, in particular by having the bidding for turn order and special privileges.  I love the way tension really builds through the game.  I'm also a big fan of the dice tower -- chaotic, but not really random because it has a "memory."  Because of the paucity of opportunities to play and the fact that I know at least two people who own it, I just don't feel the need to get it myself.

An area control with simultaneous action selection.

This game is tough. After the actions are selected, the game speeds up, but the phase to choose them can take a while - after all, there are 10 possible actions and is also possible to use all of them in the same turn.

The cube tower is neat and although is almost as random as rolling dice, the almost part makes a difference.

If you have a chance to play it, go for it.

The great thing about this game is the simplicity of play combined with the bulk of options available to you as a player. It gives you so much to do, think about, scheme etc. but in reality most turns you only can actually do 7-8 actions (based on how many players). . .

The tower mechanism is solid and lots of folks wonder if that mechanism can be applied to other games. . .

Highly recommended!

Japan during the Sengoku or “Warring States” Period: each player assumes the role of a great Daimyo with all his troops. Each Daimyo has the same 10 possible actions to develop his kingdom and secure points. To do so he must deploy his armies with great skill. Each round, the players decide which of the actions are to be played out and in which of their provinces. If battle ensues between opposing armies, the unique Cubetower plays the leading role. The troops from both sides are thrown in together and the cubes that fall out at the bottom show who has won immediately. Owning provinces, temples, theaters, and castles means points when scores are tallied. Whichever Daimyo has the highest number of points after the second tally becomes – SHOGUN!

A great replacement to Risk in a collection. There's plenty to consider as you expand your empire. The action selection mechanic (using your territory cards) is very clever. I like the tower for resolving battles as it means that there's still some degree of randomness, but that it regresses to the mean much faster than simple dice rolling. You might have bad luck in one battle if your cubes get hung up in the tower, but that will increase your chances next time.

The extra rules that Shogun offers are unnecessary, the composition of the map is less interesting, and I really do not like the artwork - the leaders depicted just do not look very japanese.

Just expect the cube tower to be really unfair sometimes!

I would like to rate it, but we played one thing wrong.  It wasn't a huge mistake, but I think it had a big impact on my opinion of the game.  We played so that in order to skip an action you put a war chest on it, not just a card.  We got the money back, but this had several effects.  1) Everyone knew what you were skipping.  2)  You didn't lose the money, but it tied the money up and made a tight economy even tighter.  3)  Since you often couldn't afford to tie up money, we were encouraged to take more actions than we wanted.  When I played, I felt that the economy was too tight, especially since it seemed to encourage you to do more than you wanted to.  This one change would probably have a significant impact on my opinion.

RATING: 10
A true masterpiece. The genius of this design is in how Dirk Henn packed in so much great randomness and chaos without the game spinning out of control. The balancing mechanisms are clever and organic. The cube tower hurts now, but helps later. Take too many provinces and you suffer in the winter grain revolts. Every season offers so many great decisions and trade offs to ponder, as you must always consider your opponents' likely actions alongside your own.

I have only played the original Wallenstein on Spielbyweb, but I think the bidding for turn order and special powers, and the new seasonal events are a great improvement. I like the new map as well, even though it is a little easier to get isolated, isolation is often not a great advantage.

I'm a little surprised that I like this because I'm not a fan of preprogramming  (I'm talking to you, RoboRally). But in this game, you can still make decisions and react to your opponents. 

Thanks to the Geek who put up the two-player variant, by the way. It works great, and this game would never get played at our house without it.

No balance between strategy, tactics and random factors, which are decisive on several levels.

What an awesome game!!  Like a hybrid of Risk (move armies around the board) and Catan (collect treasure and build) with it's own unique twists.

After a few games, we started using a variant where your opponents draft your provinces. This results in your holdings being scattered across the map and prevents turtling tendencies. We play with 5, and the game becomes a very stressful experience where no province is safe from attack and you just have to take big risks, especially in collecting rice and taxes. I still prefer this to the usual method of drafting provinces. The planning phase in this game is sheer brilliance, and the battletower is very neat. Limited number of attacks, multi-contested regions and the scoring system still overemphasize build-up (the RISK syndrome).

I was instantly drawn in by the idea of the mysterious tower for resolving combat and it didn't disappoint.  What a fun way to get instant results.  Think I had a wide smile on my face every time that cubes were dropped in.

The game itself is really clever.  Fairly easy to grasp, fairly good pacing thanks to the simultaneous planning.  Think it needs to be played fairly regularly by the same people though, takes a play to really know what's worth fighting for.

It does feel a bit lacking in today's day of tense and dynamic area control games with ever evolving strategies... but there is something that still remains fresh and unique about this system.  It's very measured and contained and that can be nice sometimes.

Fantastic.  I love the feel of combat in this one.  The rules are initially a bit hard to digest, but once gameplay begins, everything is very intuitive.  You always want to do three different things with every province, and there's always something holding you back, whether it be chests, cities, troops, or fear of revolt.  The order of the actions of a turn can have a major effect on your province allocation, and even after several games, I still find myself making tactical and strategic mistakes, which suggests that there is a lot more there for me yet to grasp.  Combat is available and necessary, but not the focus of the game.  The tower is really neat, but there's a lot more to this game than just a randomizing gimmick.  This game is good enough that it would succeed without the tower.

Shogun is a great game.  Combine the cool mechanism of the cube tower, the interesting map, and the decisions you get to make, and it's a fairly light and straightforward but deeply rewarding system.

Played Wally and thought it was long. Played this and thought it was long as well. However, I liked the bidding for turn order. And I liked the Japan map. But for the 2.5 hour playing time, I would rather play another game (like AoS) or two other games.

RATING: N/A
A few rules are improved (e.g. turn order), the map is worse (too "rectangular") and the core of the game is still exactly the same (Wallenstein).
If you own Wallenstein, just add the new rules to it.

My comment on Wallenstein (reported as it applies here as well):
Tense, strategic game, with some luck and many decisions to take. War is only a part of the game, that's based on planning (with only "imperfect" information). Best with 5 players. I dislike the combat system (the tower is a cool toy but still only a randomizer... and quite unpredictable as well!). Having only a few battles per game exacerbates the impact of luck.

Rated after four games, first one was somewhere in 2006. The second game took over five hours to complete with five players (including the setup, explaining the rules and so on - I was one of the only who had played previously). Still it seems, that there was no downtime at all, and not for one second I felt like I was waiting for the game to end. The game is heavy of course, you need to have some time, place and committed players to enjoy this one. The mechanics are marvelous, setting up the orders for whole season and events happening in more or less random order is great. The tower brings nice random event to the game and it is always nice to follow the wars. This game would easily get rating 9, if it would not take so much time, space and commitment of players, but if those are arranged, count me in.

The one thing to remember (and easy to forget) is, that most likely the war is the first step towards defeat, building buildings and keeping up defensive forces is key to success. Hmm, yeah, take strategic suggestions from guy who has played the game twice! But still, it is better than taking hints from players who have played just one half game. ;) I won the first game years ago when I concentrated on building, the second time I chose the path of war... On the third game I was forced to the war...

Updated after fifth play, I concentrated on the peace again and this time I could build my defenses and keep the peace and win the game. Great game.

FINALLY got to play this... and it's an insta-fave. Possibly a 10, I'll have to play at least once more to make sure. 

The limited action pool similar to Game of Thrones or Forbidden Stars, the special cards for each province similar to TI3's planets, classic area control like Risk, and of course, the Cube Tower! All of these things together is like blending parts of all of my favorite games, along with a theme I particularly like. I enjoyed it as much or even more than I expected. 

Initial potential issues: It's fairly difficult to spread out and conquer, it seems to be more about small expansion, then building and defending your buildings. I would enjoy some way to negate such a difficult "feed your people" phase... but revolts aren't THAT bad anyway I guess. 
It's a bit swingy, but few area control games aren't anyway.
It feels fairly complete with no expansions... I'm curious but worried about what they could add that didn't feel bloated or tacked on. 
I sort of wish there was a slight alteration to the cube tower to make it less direct to drop in the top (A small chute?) but this is not a real problem. 

Anyway, If I have a 2nd game that was as fun as my first, I'll bump this to a 10. I only hope expansions make it even better rather than distract.

Great game! The cubes tower is a nice mechanic and gives a great touch of uncertainty. It works for 3 players, although it has to be much better with 4 or 5 players

Un juego muy bueno donde la torre de cubos para las batallas aporta un toque de emoción e incertidumbre muy chulos.
Aunque funciona bien con 3 jugadores, con 4 o 5 tiene que ser mucho mejor. Mi puntuación puede subir cuando tenga la oportunidad de jugar una partida completa con más gente.

The cube tower mechanism is definitely cool, and certainly more strategic (and, yes, more random) than a simple dice roll, but that alone won't carry the game.  The nifty way that everything else comes together, though, does.  The special action/turn order thing is nice, as are the multiple functions of the cards (both in your hand/board and the action deck).  Additionally, the way that players play their cards face down, and the way that they can be stolen, is pretty cool, too.  Oh, and that you'll only be able to do one action per region each turn is a nice balancing and frustrating (but in a good way) mechanism.  That it's not an overly complex game, but is still a great challenge, is indicative of its lasting appeal.  This is a game deserving of its rating.

Simple enough mechanics and the game plays very quickly. My only complaint is that I want it to last longer but that could very well affect the game balance. It seems like just when things are starting to heat up and getting into the groove the game is over.

Shogun is based on the Wallenstein game system. The game is set in the Sengoku period (approx 1467-1573) which ends with the inception of the well-known Tokugawa Shogunate.
\13\\13\
Japan during the Sengoku or “Warring States” Period: each player assumes the role of a great Daimyo with all his troops. Each Daimyo has the same 10 possible actions to develop his kingdom and secure points. To do so he must deploy his armies with great skill. Each round, the players decide which of the actions are to be played out and in which of their provinces. If battle ensues between opposing armies, the unique Cubetower plays the leading role. The troops from both sides are thrown in together and the cubes that fall out at the bottom show who has won immediately. Owning provinces, temples, theaters, and castles means points when scores are tallied. Whichever Daimyo has the highest number of points after the second tally becomes – SHOGUN!

This is a resource management game with a feudal Japanese war game theme.  There are ten actions that can be performed each turn and players must limit each action to one province.  This throttles back the overwhelm-your-opponent strategy I dislike in other dice-based wargames.  Not to mention that this game doesn't use dice, but a randomizing tower in which armies go in and may come out or may stay behind for a later fight.

This is a game of area control with some combat. The simultaneous action system is very elaborate.

After 1 play, the game seems extremely chaotic. Some of the chaos I can deal with, like the somewhat random starting place and the half-random order of the actions and the battle tower, which is pretty unique. However, the random peasant uprisings due to rice shortages have the potential to really swing the game.

Gorgeous components and artwork, and the little changes do add up to a better game than Wallenstein (though I confess I'm much more attracted to this theme than that of Wallenstein).  The player boards are warped, and not easily fixable.  But...the actual gameplay doesn't appeal as much as it should.  It's too sluggish and processional, and lacks a proper arc.  Definitely clever and original, and that gives it tons of street cred around here, but I think the emperor may be at least partially unclothed.

At this point in time I consider Shogun to be a timeless classic. It maintains a great balance between tactics and long term strategy. The cube tower is unpredictable, but that's what makes this game super exciting. Players have to make a lot of subtle decisions in order to outmaneuver their opponents. The theme and the mechanics are very well put together, Shogun offers a really immersive, unique gaming experience. I love it!

The only downside is that Shogun needs at least 4 players to reach its full potential. Otherwise it's just fantastic. One of the finest area control games I've ever played.

Overall it's a different kind of game that I'm glad to have in my collection.

Played this for the first time at Rock-Con 2007 and loved it. The tower mechanic, bidding for your turn order/special card, and lastly, having to assign your provinces (or dummy bid cards) to your actions (half of which you don't know what order they will be resolved in!) totally won me over. I think I missed my calling as a feudal overlord taxing the life out of peasants. :-)

Fantastic game. The battles are of a high randomness, but with enough possibilities to calculate the options. And as the game goes, it's more about micro-management and trying to out-think your opponents than it is about battles anyways. A brain cracker, but once you've got the rules down (basically halfway through the first game) it plays really interestingly.

Area control of Japan set during the Sengoku period of warring states. This game has systems that I really enjoy and don't see in many(any?) other strategy area control games. Love how the setup phase is a sub game of initially placing control cubes from turns of drawing and selecting from the territory cards. The next phase has simultaneous programmed actions (revealed and hidden) which are played on your available actions board to build, muster, attack, get money or grow rice and often involve great anguish. I dig the interaction of this phase trying to second guess opponents and love the added bluff action cards dynamic in strategy! Plus, winning combat in this game means something. You claim the opponents region card---that is big! Don't forget to feed your peasants in winter...riots can be bad. I'm on the fence with the cube tower. I don't often play pure war/area control games but when I do it's Shogun.

Gaming masterpiece.  As warlords in 16th-century Japan, players attempt to secure a position of dominance for their respective clans.  The most successful warlord at the end of the game will become Shogun.  

Players all choose their various actions simultaneously and then resolve them in turn order, so there is very little down-time.  To succeed, a player will need not only to control as many provinces as possible, but also to develop his realm by building castles, temples, and theaters.  The player who manages to build the most buildings in each of the 5 regions will be rewarded with valuable bonus points.

Een spel dat in eerste instantie zal aanvoelen als een oorlogsspel, maar eigenlijk toch in essentie een meerderheden spel is.

Spelers zijn de shogun van hun clan en proberen deze clan zo veel mogelijk prestige te brengen door theaters en paleizen te bouwen in verscheidene provincies. De spelers met de meeste van iedere soort in een provincie onder controle krijgt daar punten voor.

You shuffle things around on a board, construct Things, and skirmish occasionally.

Contrary to popular nuttiness, the inclusion of a dice tower is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for quality of play.  It can enhance the gaming experience - Dragon Land is a good example - but it won't turn a dry sponge into buttermilk biscuit.

Update:

On a deeper reflection of Shogun's mechanics, I've come to a self-realization that I like pre-planning all my moves equally as much as I like pre-planning my entire life - which is to say, not at all.

I love the cube tower.  It is an excellent speculative equalizer.  The more you lose battles, the more chance you have of winning future battles.  The combination of elements is very interesting.  My only negative counterpoint is the time it takes to assign cards each round.  It can be a lengthy process that breaks up the action.  I like the game very much anyway.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Despite the hidden allocation the game tends to checkmate at the multiplayer intersections and turn into an attrition shoving match at the two player points. As with most multiplayer lines of battle games, only with the right (i.e. all good at reading the board) group of players willing to play the diplomacy alliance game to reduce the fronts does the game get good. 

Unfortunately the linear nature of the island makes the end spot empires too safe and the spots right next to the end spot empires puts you in the role of spoiler where you alone can attack the winning player and need to at the same time persuade the other players to leave you alone so that you can attack the winning player.

At first glance, this one may look heavy and time consuming for sure. However actual playing feels surprisingly smooth. Compared to today's unnecessary complicated "gamer's games," Shogun's rule amount is just right enough and well thought-out. Couldn't finish the very first session due to time shortage. Definitely want to play this game again soon.

Whoa, I sat on this for six years before finally playing the game, and fell in love with it. I love the order programming phase, the battles with the great Cube Tower, and the meta game of trying to divert attention from yourself, and bluff your way to the few extra points needed to take the win from your opponents.

Un wargame ligero que en realidad es un eurogame donde la planificación lo es todo. La torre de batallas le da un plus de azar que no hace sino aumentar la diversión del juego. Muy recomendable para jugones y para dar el paso a un siguiente nivel a jugadores de Catanes y Carcassonnes.

This is one of the earlier War/Euro hybrids and it is a really neat game.  I like the fog of war of planning for a whole round of moves while only knowing the order of half of the actions and found the cube tower entertaining if less predictable than most any other combat system I've dealt with.  I even found the risk/reward of revolts in provinces you repeatedly tax to be an interesting thing to manage.  I did feel like the random round effecting cards after you've carefully planned your moves to be one random factor too far... but I didn't think it was a game breaker as gambling on what might come up could be exciting too.  I think I'd really enjoy this a lot with the right group.

One of my biggest disappointments ever. 

This game looked like a cool, epic war-like game instead it was just a eurogame afraid of using dice. Because eurogamers hate dice, right?

RATING: 7.9
Rather torturous (in a pleasant way), as you utilize each of your ten actions in no more than one province per season.  The order in which those actions fire has quite a large impact on your choices as well.  Very interesting!  The turn order mechanism is a nice touch over Wallenstein; however, you might need to take a horrid ability in order to get the turn order you need, or vice versa.

RATING: 9
Nicely thematic and attractive visuals. Card play mechanics bring some unnecessary and distracting limitations to strategy, but on the other hand bring balance to the game. The battle tower speeds ups combat, but fills the map with too many small parts. Expect a highly addictive game with many tough decisions to make and plenty of tension for several hours. Best with five players.

Rating after first play. Have to play more to say anything sure, but first impressions are good and I love that tower.

edit feb '11: for some reasons I've been reluctant to give this one an another go.. maybe it was a bit too heavy, complicated for what it tried to do.. rating lowered from 8 -> 7 (I check the rating if I play it again, now I'm tempted to lower it more..).

Fantastic game design here!  Every session is fraught with tough decisions, which (when made correctly) are rewarded come the Winter scoring round.

This is the kind of game where a well-thought-out play will draw comments of apprectiation from your opponents, even if they just got creamed... which is one of the best things you can say about a game. Plus, given the difficulty level, there's a real sense of accomplishment when things are going well. Like all the best games, winning a game of Shogun is something you can be proud of...and which can't easily be chalked up to luck.

Every turn is a social event.  In-game interaction between players isn't at an all-time high (as in games with more conflict) but each outcome is cause for comment, discussion, laughter, comiseration, elation, dejection... all like you said ("I'll give you the 10-peso version").

The only thing holding me back from rating this game higher is... the decisions REALLY are agonizing.  It's hard work sometimes, balancing the needs of your empire with the need to expand/score more points. I think I'll just about always want to play... but the game seems a tiny bit more -challenging- than it is fun.  It's only off by an inch, but it'll never be my favorite game, for this reason.

Don't get me wrong, I love high-strategy games... and I like tough decisions... but after a good three hours (avg. for us) of Shogun, your brain'll need to cool for a bit.  Preferably over food.

I love the cube tower, great mechanic.  I game that has conflict but with a overarching goal that involves more than just beating your opponents.  The game has area control and building aspects also that round out the game nicely.

After 1 Play: I've never played Wallenstein so I can't compare.  The programmed actions add a lot of time (as that mechanic always does), and since you have ten, half the time poeple are forgetting what they programmed before they're even done programming!  The time spent having to check and recheck your allocations takes this down a notch, as otherwise I think the game system is very interesting.

This mix of wargame and eurogame is a hit for me. Lots of interaction and very little downtime (except for people waiting for my AP to pass). I like the cube tower better than dice. Very solid mechanics, although a fairly weak theme.

I think my group was a little disappointed because looking at the pieces they were expecting something more risk-like.  I was excited by the bit we played but the game got cut short before the rest of the group got comfortable with it.

I like Wallenstein better - mostly because it's easier for me, as a german, to figure out where a region/province is on the board. I don't know enough about the historical era to make it appeal to me.
As a game on it's own clearly a winner. If you haven't had the chance to check out Wallenstein give this game a try! But keep in mind that it's best to have someone prepare the game because the rules aren't that easy in the first reading.

The quasi random setup can really fuck you up for the rest of the game. Some strategical thinking involved but not very much. It's always fun to throw armies in the tower. But the tower is even more random than a d6. The nice part of the game is the planning for the phase.

The Dice Tower!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Just like its original implementation, [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3307]Wallenstein[/url], this game is all about planning, patience, and execution. And the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/179924]cube tower[/url] of course which replaces dice for battles. There's definitely a lot going on in each game and though a 4-player game can take up to 3 hours, it doesn't feel like it's enough time because there are only 2 scoring rounds. I'm not really drawn into the daimyo theme, but do appreciate that game balance and randomness has been improved.

Probably my favourite big Euro. Clever mechanics and lovely components, and everyone in the family enjoys it (it doesn't hurt that we live on-map). 

The only downside is that it does take a while to set up and take down. On balance though the time is worth it, and the family has spent many enjoyable weekend afternoons with this.

An elegant and streamlined design that feels fairly dry rescued by what is basically a gimmick: The cube tower. It works wonderfully, though, and the game is more than the sum of its parts.

I don't know about Shogun (or Wallenstein for that matter).  The game seems to have two big drawbacks:  1) the arbitrary limitations and 2) the damn action assignments.

1) The game has two major restraints that are completely arbitrary.  It's not like arbitrary limitations on things is anything new to Euros, but, since this game is so much like a warish-type game, they become glaringly obvious.  The first is the 10 card limit on actions.  You can have any number of provinces, so why is there a limit of 10?  Secondly, the limit of 18 rice.  Why can I only produce 18 rice?  That's totally stupid. I should be able to produce as much rice as my provinces are able.

2) I don't know about you, but sitting around and trying to assign my action cards is egregiously aggravating for me.  It's not like it's just some piece of extraneous chrome that only rears its ugly head once in a while; it's an integral part of the game.  It's annoying, disrupts the pace of the game, takes forever and makes me want to cut myself.

Area control in Japan and a cube tower for combat, with a reasonable play time. Thumbs up from me.

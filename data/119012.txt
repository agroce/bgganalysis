GAME: The Capitals
RANK: 1506

RATING: 6.5
A gamer's game about building up your own little city, with a mix of mechanics (tile-laying, bidding for turn order which is actually very original and painful, resource management, and some engine building), good scaling (2-5 players), and a strong theme.

The game occurs over three ages with each one consisting of several rounds (this is not a short game), and you follow a set order of actions each round, with scoring occurring at the end of each age as well as at the end of the game.  Each round you jockey for turn order, with going first being very costly if you want to go first more than once in a row, then you must build a building and there are several limitations and planing required as to not only what you will build but also where you will build- buildings come with benefits but they also often incur penalties/limitations as well.  The least of your worries is whether or not you can afford them because the cost is often free.  Then you activate a building, if you have the energy to do so.  Every so often there is a check to see who is at the top of each track (this person gets a bonus) and at the bottom (this person gets a negative)- there are several tracks:1)money, which is mostly for turn order, 2)culture, which gives in game advantages and end game points, 3)public works which is very painful to be last on, 4)population and 5) workforce with these last two tracks needing to be in sync and which are a source of negative or positive points.  Oh yes, there are negative points in this game LOTS of them. In fact you will likely have a negative score until near the very end of the game.

The game comes with an in the box expansion which allows for more diverse strategies in the form of specialized city tiles which each player holds in his hand and again must build if they can at set intervals in the game. If you can't get them built you get a very minor bonus instead but it's a real setback if you don't build them. 

This is a very involved game, and it's a bit of a grind but it's very thematic with a lot of meat to it. Very impressive in that it's the designers first game. Don't understand why people rave about Suburbia this is FAR superior.

Complex for the sake of being complex while not adding anything of value to the game itself. Rules are not well written but at least provide a number of examples to get the point across.

Very interesting ideas around this game.
Rating could be higher if it weren't for the many ambiguities we've faced when playing for the first time.
It's important to download the FAQ and errata.
The game is also quite long.

But it is definitely the best "sim city" game I've played so far.

More fiddly, longer, and unnecessarily convoluted Suburbia.  Note, I don't have much love for Suburbia either (rated it a 6).

Not to mention that the rule book is pretty bad and the board is not my cup of tea (I don't enjoy the 3/4 angle of the board).

Glen More to me still is a far superior gameplay because of the simplicity of the rules.

It has the tile planning mechanism (chieftains instead of the construction road tiles), the tile activation (placement of the tiles instead of placement/activation), and has strategic depth to plan for the scoring over 3 phases.

Nice economic game, but not that easy to learn : a lot of little icons slow down the game a lot and gameplay is very long. Besides that the gameplay is clear and the theme is well-intregated. It seems that there a chance to run away if one player has all the tourists.

I played another person's copy of this game just to confirm that I wanted to buy myself a copy.  I was predisposed to like the game, but came away from my first play convinced that I am content to play someone else's copy of the game.  Our first play with 5 players (3 new to the game) lasted nearly 5 hours, so this game may be better with a lower player count.  At any player count though, I would plan on at least a 3 hour game.

What I liked: 
1) Interesting combination of different currencies that have to be managed (bells = public works, culture, money, population, employment).  At the same time, it is important to do well on all tracks to a certain extent, so the game feels like you are just exchanging one currency for another throughout the game.
2) I like how population limits your employment, but it is not good to greatly exceed your employment either.
3) Interesting effects between buildings that can be a challenge to manage.
4) Clever multiplier on turn order track that gives you pause before taking the $0 space, even when you are content going last.

What I disliked:
1) There aren't enough interesting decisions for how long the game takes to play.
2) There is randomness in the buildings that come up that can greatly impact your strategy, especially if you are low in turn order.
3) The first player can hold onto first as long as they are willing to pay $18 per turn (= 4.5 vps). The result is that the turn order "auction" is not that dynamic in the last half of the game.
4) Buildings cost no money to build, thus making it easier to reserve money to dominate turn order.
5) Players have hidden objectives that overlap.  There is a high likelihood that someone's actions may interfere with your plans, but the information is hidden so you don't know who that person may be until it may be too late.
6) A "low bells" approach is impractical in a high player count game, which limits flexibility.  -8 pts per turn in a 5 player game is punishing.
7) There is a snowball element to this game that did not appeal to me.

Essentially, The Capitals is a deeper, more complex version of Suburbia, but it maintains a similar degree of randomness.  Unfortunately, for my tastes, the game is too long for this degree of randomness.

It's heavy, but brilliant.  Great city builder with some serious depth, and multiple paths for victory.  The activation mechanism (and cascading activations) is brilliant.  Really looking forward to getting it to the table again.

Even though it is deep, the iconography is great, along with the tile reference that covers off on any questions that might come up on the various structures' abilities.  Once you have the iconography downpat, it flows very nicely.

A good city-building game.  I think this is what I expected from Suburbia, but Suburbia is a light tile layer.  This one has a lot more going on with tile laying and tons of tracks (aspects of your city) to manage.  It can be very punishing early.

Played it for a second time, but with 4 players instead of 3 players this time.  I liked it better with 4 and look forward to playing it again.  There are a decent number of exception rules in this game, but I still like it.  It's good.

Based on 1 play, and the verdict is out. On the one hand, it's multiplayer solitaire. The game is very slow to start. 

But about half way through, the engine is ramped and you want to generate VPs from your city. Not sure how much luck there is involved with purple tiles. And the game seems mostly tactical as you deal with the tiles that come up turn to turn. Not sure how much 'strategy' there is in this game.

Will need replay to reassess.

RATING: 5.5
I was excited about this game, since Suburbia is one of my all-time favorites. I was disappointed. It is certainly more complex than Suburbia: the board is nothing but a bunch of tracks (eight, to be exact), and the tiles you acquire move the tracks up or down according to their abilities. Just like Suburbia, right?

Wrong. First of all, the majority of the game is just bookkeeping: it doesn't present nearly as interesting spatial options for placing your buildings, and you spend most of your time doing accounting. With so many tracks to manage, each turn I invariably forgot to move something up or down, or that one building interacts with another. The multitude of tracks makes this far more tedious and more prone to human error than Suburbia (which also suffered from a similar problem). 

More annoying, however, was that you spend the first two-thirds of the game scrambling to stay in the black, accumulating nothing but negative points for a majority of the game. Finally, in Era III, you begin to score in earnest, but many of your points are merely cancelled out by the negative ones you acquired earlier.  The end result is a final score that seems pathetic compared to the amount of thought and energy you put into the game. It is a very unsatisfying experience. The game would have been better if they had recalibrated the point system to give mainly positive points in varying degrees of rewards (so, -3 points = 0 points, -2 points = 1 point, etc.).

RATING: 7
I took a chance on this one, and ended up liking it. Sort of a Race for the Galaxy: The Tile-Laying Game, sort of. Anyway, this is a nice engine-building/special-power-interaction/city-building game, where you are trying to both manage 4 variables (tech, culture, services, and population); unlike a lot of games, you can't just specialize and make the most efficient one-trick pony possible, you need to manage and balance (although probably you'll still want to emphasize one thing). The iconography is dense, but it's fairly straightforward to understand once you get the hang on it, which should be easy.

It's unfortunately a bit long for what it is, especially since if you don't get some synergies going by the middle of the game you're probably out of it, and that can happen due to bad timing or bad luck. It's not terrible, but keep the player count down I think; it's nice the game supports 5, but 3 or 4 is probably best. Still, I have to say, even though our games have gone more like 3 hours than the advertised 90 minutes, I've found them engaging throughout.

The other unfortunate thing is the several key errors on the player aids and the confusing rules, particularly on initiative order but in a couple other areas also. It's not terrible, but a little sloppy. Definitely download the replacement player aid here.

Haven't tried the prosperity buildings yet; there is a lot going on here without them, so not sure if the game needs them really. But I look forward to giving them a try at some point.

Anyway, this isn't a game that isn't likely to be considered particularly elegant, but it does effectively deploy the tropes of city-building games, as well as anyone has done.

RATING: 5
I liked the idea of the game quite a bit, but since I played Suburbia first, I couldn't help but feel that this was a more complicated version of it without really any of the payoff for the complexity.

It's definitely neat trying to get an engine going of buildings that work well together, and there's a novel turn order mechanism at work here that makes jockeying for position pretty interesting.

However, the building interaction can begin to lead to more and more downtime as people work through their spreadsheet of interactions, especially late in the game where it's hard to remember everything you have.  So, the thing that makes the game fun also makes the game really start to drag.

Overall, the game is really well designed.  I just can't say I really was having fun by the end of it when things were dragging.  With Suburbia as an alternative that I feel does most of the same things much more snappily.

Crikey this game is fiddly, takes an age and is so annoying and I was winning. I wasn't a fan of the design of the board as soon as it hit the table. Why do I have to take positive and negative point tokens. It's annoying constantly having to make change. It seems that once you have found your combo then that's it. That's what you will do for the next x turns until the game ends. Boring. Love the art on the buildings and the idea but I don't see why anyone would play this when Suburbia exists. 1 Play.

This game has spoiled Suburbia for me as it has the same mechanics but a much more tighter economy and resource management. Don't let the negative points on most of the game fool you. Just accept that you will lose points. This is a game that deserves more praise.

Holy Icons Batman!!!

This is a game for those who loved Suburbia, but thought it suffered from not having enough icons. It's another one of those multiplayer solitaire games, with an even shorter time horizon of tiles available to pick from. Every round  anew set comes out, and all the new tiles are the same price: free. Which means jockeying for turn order can be important. And I have to say I do like the turn order system.

Overall there are some interesting things going on, but unfortunately you generally ignore what other players are doing (or if you didn't, the game would drag), other than the tracking markers on the main board (which is all there is on the main board). 

The additional complexity beyond Suburbia is definitely not for everyone, and I'm not even sure if it's for me, but I did enjoy my first play (although it felt a little slow towards the end), and I look forward to playing again, so that says something.

Didn't get this the one time I played it. Have to say it didn't leave a strong impression. I love Suburbia, but this one didn't pull me in. I expected more points from the tiles and the tracks, but you really need to find a way of pushing yourself off the end of a track to win points. Finished with a negative score.

RATING: 8
This is not a kind game. It doesn't hate you to the level of some other titles (insofar as you can't actually bust out entirely) but you are likely to be at negative points for most of the game. (I went into turn #12 of 12 with 0 points, and I *won*. And yes, we were playing with the Prestige buildings.)

Interaction is higher than it looks at first glance: in addition to turn order affecting building draft, relative position on several of the board tracks is important - most particularly for culture, where the leader gets both the tourist marker from one or more laggards as well as an extra building activation. This is pretty huge. (Not that the VP penalties from being behind Civics are a cakewalk, mind you.)

For the first 2/3 of the game, the initiative system was awesome: the multiplication makes staying ahead wickedly expensive, and rewards cycling your position. Later on, incomes rose high enough that it became possible for players to lock in first (or second) place. It's not  clear that this was actually a net advantage on points, but it still felt a bit odd.

Much better than Suburbia. It still has the spatial aspect to it, which I don't care for. But, There are several tracks to advance on, and a player cannot "win them all", but must prioritize. The turn order bid is very interesting, making it very expensive to maintain an early spot turn after turn. Much less fiddly than Suburbia, and it doesn't suffer from swingy end-game scoring and last player advantage that Suburbia does.

An interesting city building game but has a bit more complexity than Suburbia. Along the way of building your city, you have different tracks for population, jobs, unemployment, technology advancement, culture and public works. Each of these tracks will penalize you if you decide to ignore them so maintaining balance is critical. Running out of money is brutal as you need to pay for player order every round, even if you go last. 

There is more going on in this game than there is in Suburbia. The puzzle presented to each player is quite interesting and the game does force you to concern yourself with balancing out lots of different factors in the game. Yet the restrictions put in place to create the puzzle only seem to fit if you think about it in terms of game play. For instance, city tiles have restrictions that seem mostly arbitrary. In Suburbia those same restrictions with penalties exist but in a thematic way (e.g. houses don't want to be next to slaughterhouses). I did think the bonus scoring with proprietary tiles throughout the game that needed to be placed in the city made the decisions about when to claim bonuses more interesting. 

I liked the game but not sure if it's going to replace Suburbia when I want to build a city.

RATING: 6
The game certainly has some fun elements, but for 5 players it has taken us 4-5 hours to play. Even after playing it twice, I can't realistically see getting a 5 player game down to any less than 3 hours.

Edit: even with 2 players, it still took 3 hours to play. Unless you just want to play by instinct, there are way too many calculations in this game to play in the claimed 90 minutes, even with only 2 players.

Most of the calculations in the game get a little monotonous, too. One tile might provide 2 workers, 1 culture, -1 public works and the option for trading energy for $4 in the future and another option for gaining population if nearby building are used. The three other tiles you have to choose from will all be very similar, but slightly different in this or that. Calculating which tile is best for you, then deciding if it's also best for your opponent, then possibly recalculating... it all gets sort of tiresome.

As much as I was sure I'd prefer this game to Suburbia, I didn't. The things this game has going for it cannot at all outweigh the fact that the game drags and drags. We nearly quit our final game before finishing.

My first impression is long, boring and unforgiving. If you get a bad start (be it due to bad luck or stupidity) it's hard to catch up. 

The playtime listed while not a blatant lie is quite far from the truth, I'd say at least 45 min per player and that's not even with slow players.

Second impression is that it is even more boring than I remembered. Simply not a game for me.

SOLD IT!

Comparing it to Suburbia is unavoidable. Both are essentially about playing city tiles that combo with existing one in your city. Capitals has more "resources" to manage and this is a good thing, but much of the gameplay is buried under some superfluous elements like buying turn order (at least with 2 players), passing about the extra "coal car", and moving your "build here" roads. These are things that ought to make the game deeper, but in the end adds nonsense maintenance. Suburbia just does a much better job in ramping out your city in cleaner style.

A few plays in and the game looks like a keeper. The game really opened up when we learned that you can apply the effects from either placing or activating a tile as you wish. That is, you total up everything by category and get the effects in the order you want.

For example, you could get population for an adjacent tile before getting workers for the tile you’re actually activating. This freedom enabled some interesting tile placements that created activation circles and is the hook for me wanting to play the game again.

The game is quite tight in the way Agricola is so you have to be prepared to scrape by for the first, say, 75% of the game with a sense of flailing and being in negative victory points. It’s only towards the end that things come together and you dig yourself out of the VP hole and have an engine to run, but that arc of accomplishment is what the game is about. But not for the fainthearted who can’t deal with the tension of not having positive feedback from the game from the get-go.

***RULES CLARIFICATIONS***
 
[The designer] has been very clear that all effects are lumped together and resolved in the order of your choosing. The only exception is instant and construction (wrench) effects.

In this case, you:

1. choose which category to apply first
2. lump together everything in that category
- resolve those effects in the order of your choosing
3. Lump together everything in the other category
- resolve those effects in the order of your choosing.

UPDATE: My group plays with this variant for revealing new buildings. 

Reveal one more building than the normal rules call for and place it immediately in the $2 space.

Nagyon gonosz, nagyon büntetős játék. Amire igazából semmi szükség nincs, mert mindenhol lehetne plusz pontokat osztani a mínuszok helyett. Így kell némi mentális felkészülés, hogy az ember leüljön mellé és elviselje, hogy simán befejezheti a játékot -10 ponttal. Az eredeti szabályokkal nagyon szűk a lapkaválasztási lehetőség, ami szerintem feleslegesen növeli a szerencse szerepét - legalábbis két főnél - de szerencsére a szabálykönyv ajánl egy bővített opciós variánst, amitől nagyságrendekkel jobb lesz a játék. Sajnos a szabály sok helyen pontatlan, illetve a player aidnek ellentmond, de szerencsére van faq, ami mindent megold.
Vegyes érzelmek.
Ha csak a jobbik variánst nézem, és nem veszem figyelembe a felesleges gonoszságot és a hibár player aidet, akkor 8 körülire is értékelném.
Így legyen egy átlag 7.

Played a five player game at BGGCON 2013. One of the worst games I have ever played. Some of the design decisions in this game completely baffle me. 

The only purpose of money is to bid for turn order because buildings are completely free. Not only are they free, but the buildings no one wanted in the previous rounds get more expensive the future rounds which seems backwards to me.

You have all these buildings in your city but unless you have the highest culture OR get to one of the high level power plants you may only activate one of them on your turn. This means that the majority of the benefits you get from your buildings come from the immediate effects on initial placement or triggering bonuses from other buildings whenever you activate one of your buildings. Either way the "combos" are not terribly exciting and it makes for a very dull city building experience (though I guess you get what you pay for seeing as how the buildings are free). Buildings also have an energy cost to them, and the only time you regain energy is by upgrading your power plant or passing on all your activations for a turn (some buildings can also provide energy). This double limitation system makes no sense. You could get essentially the same result if you allowed any number of building activations and kept the energy costs the same. The method in which energy costs to activate a building increases in this game (1 plus number of cubes on building) is a large enough limitation in itself (cubes don't clear until an expo, i.e. every 4 rounds). 

Things that I think could have improved the game:
Giving buildings a cost so that money is more important
Starting with the Age II buildings in Age I. The problem with the Age I buildings is that they are weak and incredibly boring. The buildings don't actually get interesting until the second phase of the game. I see no reason beyond pure sadism to make players  go through the first phase of the game.
Allow multiple building activations making energy the only limitation factor.

We all decided to prematurely end the game about halfway through (during the 6th round) because it was clear that not a single person was enjoying himself/herself.

Some tiles create great combos but you may never get them. The rules are badly written and need errata.

Fun "Sim City" like game. I rate it high even if the first play took 4 hours (4 players)and had a lot of rules questions. Still we didn't feel as it was slow playing. But the potential is very high. 
I don't understand the comparision with Suburbia. This is both different and a far superior game. While Suburbia is just a plain tile laying game, slightly more complicated than Carcassonne.

Not that good.
Actions during a phase limited by a powerplant is dumb. Activating buildings too, I mean if it's built, shouldn't it be activated?

City Council is a much much MUCH better City game that this thing... Suburbia is also much much better

Don't buy this!

Deep and brain-burning city building, which is exactly what I was looking for. Very thematic considerations as you look to balance your city's economy, culture, population, employment levels, public infrastructure and technological progress. Becomes increasingly difficult as your city grows because there is more and more to monitor. Excellent production value and a tonne of unique buildings for strong replayability factor too.

A more serious and less fun version of Suburbia. Unlike Suburbia there's no clear indication of what a good strategy consists of. After 3 hours of play I had no idea why the winner had done so well, while another player (who appeared to be running away with the game) had come last. Much too long a playing time for the enjoyment on offer.

Not a ton to say about this one, other than that the play is remarkably straightforward once you get the extensive symbology down. This comes with a serious disclaimer: If you are not playing with other economic efficiency experts, be prepared for every round to turn into an ordeal as the mental math behind of every single action brings play to a standstill. You have to "spend money to make money" in this game, and some players simply cannot come to terms with this--thinking they are doing something wrong.

You can tell that the designers tried *so hard* to balance this game, but it scales like garbage. The BGG community is spot-on when they designate a 5-player game as "not recommended," because culture in particular becomes an unstoppable snowball. Nonetheless, it is quite an intriguing challenge, and will be revisited...with a laundry list of house rules.

Básicamente es un juego de colocación de losetas. En ese sentido muy parecido a City Tycoon. La diferencia con este es que hace menos hincapié en la activación de edificios, cambiándola por la necesidad de ir avanzando en una serie de tracks que van definiendo las características de la ciudad en cuanto a niveles de población, servicios públicos, trabajo, dinero producido etc ...

Estéticamente chulo.

This was more of a 3 hour torture session than a game.  I really don't like how it rewards people who get ahead, and punishes those who fall behind.  You can pretty much tell who's going to win after 30-40 minutes, so you're just sitting there waiting for another 2+ hours for it to end.  It does have a lot of detail of needing things like administration, infrastructure, merchants, etc.; but it needs MANY improvements on the rules before I even consider to look at this game again.

The Capitals is a heavy-euro city builder.  Its target audience is, or should be, players who like the theme of Suburbia but want to see the genre get the complex-game treatment.  It will not be for everyone.

At first glance there is a lot to manage - six different tracks representing different aspects of the city, not to mention spatial positioning and overlapping effects.  Each of the tracks, however, is simple in function.  I haven't found the tracking particularly daunting:  resolve a construction or an effect, move the appropriate cube.

What can be difficult to manage, however, are the various ongoing effects previously placed buildings may have on your city.  Especially for those buildings placed several turns prior.

The turn order mechanism is the game's greatest innovation in my view - it gets expensive to repeatedly go early but for players who have built up the appropriate engine, this path can be very rewarding.  Is the ability to take first position every turn for $18 a worthy reward for the first player to set up a sustainable engine, or an undesirable blemish on an otherwise engrossing game?  Or option three, not worth the effective 4.5VP/turn cost?

rulebook is a little hard to understand.  make sure you read through carefully and the FAQ before first play.

RATING: 7
I definitely get why people call this a heavier version of suburbia. Very similar "select and place a tile" fundamental mechanics, but there are a number of different aspects of your city you are managing and maintaining as well as creating affiliations between your tiles. There is a good deal of variety and a pretty unique mechanic for determining turn order each turn. It plays long, so you want to keep the player count down to three. Also, there are few "race" mechanics where players who are last on a scale lose points or actions to those who are higher on the scale. With 3 players, it is manageable. With 5 players, that player in last is getting screwed left and right. Don't be at the bottom of more than one track! Better yet, just stick with three.

The different tracks offer new experiences and the buildings seem well balanced. Maybe there are too many different sorts of buildings and a bad combination of them when are drawn in the beginning of the round can ruin a game for some players, but this is an usual problem in this kind of games.

You build a tableau/engine to create several resources. 
Money: used to buy turn order and buildings (4:1 VP at end game)
Culture: used to steal an energy resource from the opponent with the least culture (2:1 VP at end game)
Public Service: used to buy buildings and can periodically boost your Progress
Progress: unlocks new power plants which give you some VP and are your main source of energy cubes
Population: limits the amount of employment you can have
Employment: Gives VP, you're penalised for having more people than employment.

You place buildings and activate them with energy. There is a scoring round every 4 turns which scores just population/employment.

The game is okay but not great. It's very punishing and the players need to have a keen sense of what is valuable and how to curtail each other's plans. It can be very frustrating when the tiles you need fail to show up, especially if someone has set their snowball rolling.

If this played in 60min it would be fine but the 3p game I played took over 2 hours and that is simply too long for what you get out of this game. Too few meaningful decisions often you are trying to make the most of what is available. You're inability to see which buildings will be available in the future makes strategic play impossible.

A denser Suburbia - a bit more demanding, a little punishing, with many different paths to victory.

Only played once, with three players, and it was a learning game so it was extra long, but hopefully would get faster.  We kept forgetting placement rules and never did decide how the initiative phase was SUPPOSED to work.  The player aid isn't clear, and the rulebook wasn't either.  We ended up changing the process halfway through the game, but I don't think it affected the overall outcome.  Sitting in negative points for 10 of the 12 rounds is rather odd too, and does not give any indication of final scoring at all, and as a result it really does feel like solitaire city building while bidding for initiative to grab buildings from the pool.

I love this game.  The balance is perfect.  I love that if you build a lot of industry, you have a lot of population and employment, but no tourist.  You can start out thinking "I'm going to make an industrial town", or a "touristy town", or a "big business town".  My first game I started out thinking industrial and did pretty well.  I can't wait to try mixing up some other methods.

I will say that learning how the tourism and initiative worked was a little sticky from reading the rules, but a video on youtube straightened us out.

Pretty good euro city builder. The placement restrictions make buying and building your city an interesting puzzle. The tourism track is like a built in runaway leader creator but there has to be a huge tourism disparity to start it and the rest of the game tries to balance that out. There isn't any true interaction but as multiplayer solitaire it does a good job of making you want to do better than your opponents and take their interests in mind while making choices. The turn order bidding mechanic, placement penalties, and scoring reward good planning. The game hands out negative points like candy and that could be a downer to some but only poor play will result in an end game negative score.

This game appears to have so much going for it, and that potential is probably there, built in to the game. But something is off. It could be the technical flaws. It might be the apparent lack of support of more than one strategy*. It may just be the general feeling of frustration I get when playing it. The additional complexity excites me but at the end of the day, I'd just rather play Suburbia.

* There is certainly multiple strategies, multiple paths to victory. But I've never seen a game in which more than one player's engine took off. All the players made reasonable decisions but the buildings to support them only appeared for one, leaving the others hopelessly disappointed and frustrated.

Played 3 times and culled before it was generally available.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.7
A more strategic and complex implementation of many of the same concepts as Suburbia. More things to track, more things to compete on, more resources to manage.

There's luck in what tiles come up for taking each round, you may have a strategy whose tiles don't show up, or perhaps you want a tile and so does someone else, while another player is on their own path, but of the two this is the game I far prefer.

The best city building game on the market so far; we played it with every possible number of players (2-5) and had a blast in each constellation; there are so many possible strategies you could use, that the replayability seems endless, esp. when you count in the "free" expansion, which is included (purple buildings); but be aware that this game is tough, not regarding the rules, but the deep it provides, so I would surely call it a heavy gamer´s game besides its "cute" graphics.

Lots of options, lots of choices, from what tile to get, to where to place it and then what to activate and how much to pay on the initiative track and what Prosperity tile should I be focusing...

Game very well built, well balanced...

The only issue is the time... it was our first game and it was over 2 hours (maybe close to 3H), with more experience the time can be shortened a bit but I don't think that much... doubt that a 4 player game can be done in less than 2H

Fun, but oh my god the AP
----
just looking at the game board induces a bit of cold panic. For me there is a problem of cohering, in that sometimes the game feels like it spins out of control -- so many widely diverging choices that lead to widely diverging states of the world, all done without supervision from your opponents, who are equally absorbed trying to get their tableaux squared away. Whereas Suburbia chooses to end the game right around the point a powerful engine comes into its own, The Capitals has you build and then ride that engine while you start spinning points out of seemingly your imagination -- again the lack of cohering. There is also a kind of the game playing itself, with you having the ability to interrupt it only occasionally -- it's easy to fall into a pattern of trivial choices. Downgrading from 7.5

O The Capitals já seria legal só por ser prata da casa: o designer é daqui de Brasília, e já tive a oportunidade de jogar o jogo com o cara, inclusive. Mas não é só isso: a temática de cidades disputando quem recebe um evento mundial ficou bastante atual. A mecânica pode ser complicada para novatos: são muitos tracks paralelos para acompanhar, muitos recursos diferentes para gerenciar. E o mecanismo de iniciativa é a coisa mais inovadora e funcional do jogo - além de encaixar bem no tema. Recomendo fortemente, item fundamental da coleção.

Worst game I've played in a long while. Claim of 90 minutes a game is complete nonsense. Allow 1 hour per player. Has runaway leader problem. We knew who was going to win halfway through. Icons are confusing and scattered all over--you have to go through all your tiles with every play to make sure you're not missing stuff. VERY similar to Suburbia (even the implementation of lakes!) only cumbersome and bloated. Felt like a bunch of spreadsheets--all the board has are point tracks.  Avoid this and play Suburbia.

It seemed to have the ingredients of a decent game when reading the rules. In practice, it's ever so slow and ends up being irritating. With 5 players anyway. Maybe it's because I've been conditioned by so many Euros to believe that drafting games are quickish. Here each player is drafting exactly one building out of 7 (in a 5p game) each turn. But each building brings with it many implications. You need to consider the progress it brings across its multiple tracks (where each track has implications for both progression and non-progression), plus perhaps multiple ongoing effects once its placed in your city. Further, the placement of each tile needs to be considered, vis a vis relationships with other buildings. Plus building costs dependent on what it's placed next to. Which makes for a decision tree which requires a lot of downtime. Add to that the fiddliness of the accounting across all those scoring tracks. And the further the game goes, the harder it is to process the best way to activate your buildings, as well as increasing the difficulty of determining best placement, which increases the downtime. It felt like a computer game trying to transpose itself into a boardgame, but without conquering the need to ensure that it has a social requirement, that it requires more than just lots of downtime optimizing your own sandbox to be successful. It at least provides lots of avenues to explore so it may come out again as a 3-player, but it's got some making up to do.

This theme Just like suburbia but many thing different and hard to play. I think this game have a stick mechanic and play style , such as population not good for game, worker is better than any thing and culture is bad thing with poor benefit. So all player must play in a same way by build worker (employment) for VP this only way to get VP , if i miss some building with employment power in 1st age what happen to me? lose too much VP, OMG.

The Capitals is a city-building game in which you buy tiles and place them in your own city.   The tiles provide you with icons that make you go up certain tracks, and also negative icons with cause you to go down other tracks, so most tiles (especially early on) are a trade-off.  The tile may also give you an action that you can take, but will often have a cost for that action that makes it too a trade-off.  The early game is characterized by everyone losing a ton of points because they aren't high enough on the tracks, and you end up spending a large part of the game trying to get yourself out of the hole, though it's really difficult because of the significant trade-offs to buying and using tiles.  Many of the tracks reward players for their position relative to others, keeping the game interactive, particularly as the tiles are drafted in a turn order that people pay for.  While this game really goes out of its way to smack the players around early, I found the slow build-up of better and better tile abilities and trying to manage my position on the various tracks to be a lot of good brain-burny fun.

RATING: 7
It's like a mix of suburbia and prosperity. Trying to manage 5 or 6 tracks, avoiding the negative points and watching where you're spatially putting tiles makes this one intense. A lot of downtime and a lot longer play time than the box lists. Maybe if you know the game and have fast players, you could reasonably hit 90 minutes, but I assume it's closer to 30-45 minutes per player unless I'm missing something. I'd fully expect a 5 player game to push 3-4 hours which is far too long for this type of game.

I thought the tiles had wonderful artwork and the components were pretty nice. Brutal game, but thinkier than Suburbia.

RATING: 7.5
A city-building game, where players buy building tiles, place them within their city forming building blocks and activate them to gain points, money and bonuses.

There is one "main" path to earn victory points and that is by increasing your employment track; by building and activating certain buildings, you get to increase these values.

Apart from employment, this game offers many different paths to earn victory points and hinder your opponents if you leave them behind; you can gain points by increasing your city's culture, activating certain buildings or leaving your opponents behind in the public services track.

Player turn is also very important in this game, as you get the first shot in buying a new building and deciding first your turn order for the next round. People who love [thing=2651][/thing] might get a bit frustrated, as by the end-game, the person in the last position will always go last in almost everything. Remaining first is very expensive, of course (18 coins vs 1 coin to remain last), but usually everyone has money by the end-game.

The key element in the game is to build one's city carefully; you can create building blocks which synergize greatly with each other and, with a single activation, earn money, population, employment and even victory points as well, altogether. Identifying strong building combos is vital to building your engine; people who neglect their engine and just aim to get ahead on the population/employment track will have a hard time progressing in the rest of the game.

Compared to most eurogames, which I love, this game has rather a steep learning curve; there are literally a lot of things that are going on, many areas to keep track of, numerous rule details and usually a lot of Analysis-Paralysis between rounds. However, once you learn the rules the game goes on smoothly, as each turn has literally a small number of available actions. The player who can develop a good long-term plan and also adapt to the current building options will be rewarded at the end of the game.

Cool city building game. When it first came out I didn't get the chance to play it and I knew it was some friends highly rated game and other friends right out hated it. It was getting missed reviews so when I had the chance to get it for a second pick at the gathering I took it. It is a tricky game to learn since there is so much symbology to pick up on. But, by the end it was easy going and I am sure after a few plays it will be even better. Won't be for everyone. A bit of a leader problem if there is a good combo- unstoppable, potentially. Look forward to more plays- happy to own it!

RATING: 6
This game really wowed me on the first play, particularly in comparison to Suburbia. Comparatively this game has a lot more meat on it's bones. It has a tougher tile placement system when you build your city, and several charts that you have to budget.  Additionally, after the tile selection phase there's a building activation phase where you spend yellow cubes from your power plant to activate the functions of buildings that allow you to do so.

The most critical part of the game is making sure you have as many people and as many jobs as possible. This is so critical to scoring well, that the other three charts are really just there to support and distract from that singular goal. There's a lot to like about this game... however my second play soured me.

The game sets up many situations where you are forced to take on negative points, in some cases through a fault more to do with the tile selection options you have and or your ability to predict which tiles other players will select first if they go before you. The frequent penalties certainly feels punitive. In particular, one of the tracks gives each player -2 points for each player above them, and it goes so far as to break ties by position on the money track, so even if you stand at the same level as someone else you may get hit for points.

The turn order system is also strange and mathy. You pay money for turn order equal to the cost of your new position times the multiplier of your old position. The inability to pay results in losing points.

The game also gives you six special scoring tiles that you get a chance to play when the round marker crosses a purple ribbon. All of the tiles require you to have achieved the most or least of something specific. If you can't meet those requirements than the tile has to be placed as a lake, which instead of a powerful effect just gives you 2 energy. Well, I had major trouble, as half the tiles I was given were just plain not achievable because they relied on me having the least of something that I was not capable of controlling. The most galling ones were the one that wanted me to have the least on the bell track, which meant working to set myself up to take negative points, and the one that wanted me to have the least energy when my opponents were perpetually at 0.

I think there's something to this game. I'd like to give it another chance, but I just can't. As dressing on top, the chart iconography is a little unclear, particularly when it comes to which charts you can spend and when, there are printed mistakes on the player aids, and there's so much to absorb in terms of planning and looking up all the building abilities that any additional static pushes it over the line from interesting-complicated to over-complicated. We also had a hard time finding information we needed in the rulebook, which feels silly to say, since it's not the worst rulebook I've ever seen by far, but we kept missing critical things because very important information about tracks was scattered between the front of the book in the icon explanation and the back of the book where they list out the phase process.

A very complex game, but once you abosorb and understand how elements of gameplay impact each other, it really is a pretty good game.  Not for people looking for a quick light game though. Design and artwork are quite well done...playing most of the game collecting negative points that you hope to overcome at the end was an interesting twist.

This is a very stressful game. You will most likely score negative points for 3/4 the game, then come shooting back up towards the end. It makes the last 1/4 of the game pretty fun, but those early rounds are agonizing, especially since there doesn't seem to be much reason for the stress. The difficulty seems extremely artificial, since all it really boils down to is how many tiles the game allows you to buy/activate. The tile activation abilities seem extremely varied in usefulness, so paying most of your money to be first player so you can grab the only decent one seems to be the best strategy each round.

These issues become much more apparent when playing with the prosperity tiles, since you seem to have very little control towards meeting the conditions to play one, even though they are some of the biggest point scoring tiles in the game.

Overall, the game just isn't very clever at hiding its flaws, of which there seem to be many.

[u]The Positive[/u]
(+) Original and 'fresh' artwork, the game looks different

(+) Very nice implementation of city-building theme. All tiles seem to tell a story of their own and putting them together also create unique cities with unique stories. Do integrate this into your game experience!

(+) Some very clever gaming mechanics (e.g. turn order bidding in which going early increases the price to pay in the next round, some clever engine building aspects by causing 'chain reactions' by selecting the right building tiles and cleverly placing them, the stealing of tourists and the balance between population and employment).

(+) The game offers lots to think about: you have to manage 6 different aspects of your city, and it will not be easy to pull this off successfully. However, when you do find the right balance, the game is very rewarding as the effects of a good position on these different aspects are really meaningful. It is great fun when you balance population with employment and you see points coming in while your opponents still see the points going out. A good culture score might attract tourists from your opponent cities and they offer a great flexibility when activating your buildings. Being rich buys you real power in this game. Having lots of technology aids a great deal in scoring points and obtaining enough power to keep getting your buildings activated. Public service avoids you getting penalties and puts you in a comfortable position to be able to build powerful buildings.

(+) Some nice engine building aspects in which the selection and careful placement of the right buildings will greatly influence your game

(+) The game sure grows: tiles keep getting more interesting and you enjoy increasing opportunities to activate buildings or make powerful building combinations throughout the game

(+) The game mechanic in which you can place up to 5 special 'prosperity' tiles in the course of the game based on special building requirements (having the most or the least of certain things) is nice and gives players some strategic path to hold on to when starting the game.

(+) I like the mechanic in which you can break the building rules by taking a point-penalty

(+) The Capital has some tactical aspects in selecting the right building and placing it correctly, but I feel it is rather strategic in nature. As I like variety and I feel most heavy games around emphesize tactical play, to me this is a significant advantage.

[u]The Negative[/u]
(-) [Minor disadvantage] The main board looks cool with its 3D-effect, but it's actually not very functional to keep track of things. However, after playing a first round you should be fine.

(-) [Minor disadvantage] This game is a pain to set up with of ton of different tiles.

(-) [Minor disadvantage] The rulebook is not the best one I've seen: some ambiguities and even contradictions are present in the rulebook and some printing errors on an otherwise very useful player aid are unfortunate given the complex nature of this game.
 
(-) First time players will sure be overwhelmed by the many icons on the building tiles. At first this may detract players from the thematic background which sure is there. This is really something new players must overcome, because once they familiarize themselves with the icons, they will appreciate the huge variety of building effects. I admire the designer for creating such richness in effects with a limited set of icons which really do their job wonderfully - but only once you get the hang of it.

(-) With all its symbols, and considerations when placing tiles and intertwining resource tracks, this game is prone to analysis paralysis. Playing the game takes time commitment and this is not an experience meant for those with little patience.

(-) The game involves some (minor) bookkeeping. As your city grows (you start out with only 2 building tiles but end up with 19 tiles!) there is a lot more to keep track of and it is easy to forget about some permanent effect you put into place on a far corner of your city 2 hours ago.

[u]Conclusion:[/u]
The Capitals is a rather unique game despite the city building theme which has been used in other games. With fresh colors and playful art it looks different from other games and it really does tell its own story. With some unique (some would say weird) mechanics and a huge amount of symbols and icons, the designer and publisher have made a couragous choice of giving this game a very distinct character and a unique flavor which will probably not appeal to everyone. Especially not to those looking for a quick or simple game or something similar to games/mechanics they are already familiar with. Personally, I greatly appreciate this colorful game which refuses to comply with generally accepted aspects of boardgaming and dares venture elsewhere. Call me crazy, but despite the very well done theme of a city builder, this game is much more similar to "Through the Ages" than "Suburbia". I personally think Suburbia is a rather bland tile placement game which reveals most of its secrets after just one game. "The Capitals" has similar tile placement mechanics in its engine building core, but it adds a touch of this very delicate and clever balancing of different resources/aspects which you only find in those rare masterpieces like "Through the Ages". It's a game which will probably not hit the table very often due to it not being popular with everyone and the considerable time it takes to set it up and play, but I wouldn't want to miss this unique title for the world in our game collection!

[u]Tips:[/u]
(*) At the start of the game, we like to compose our starting deck of 6 prosperity tiles with a 'choose one and pass' mechanic similar to the 7-wonders mechanic. We also tend to play with the variant in which you always draw 2 + # players new tiles due to the added opportunities of more building tiles
(*) At the start of the game, expect to get some penalty points: you are only a small village trying to get things set up for greatness. It can even be worth getting some penalties at this point if this helps you building up. Don't be hard on yourself or the game at this point - the points will come flowing in once your engine starts running and getting positive victory points in will be twice as rewarding :)
(*) Use your starting deck of prosperity tiles as a strategic guideline for your game.
(*) Being first on the culture track is very rewarding as tourists really make life easier. Even if you don't stand a chance to obtain the first spot on this track, investing at least a little might keep your own tourist home and it is always a good thing to have some margin to spend some culture with building (activation) effects. Having a solid first place on the culture track makes technology slightly less important as you can use tourists to activate your buildings. It can also be a significant point generator at the end of the game.
(*) Try not to be too far behind on the public service track. You will need it in order to build some important buildings later on.
(*) Having money in this game really helps in getting the right buildings. Try to obtain an engine with 2 commercial buildings next to each other.
(*) Be mindful of the population and employment tracks, as they allow for huge point swings! The population track serves as a cap on the employment track - but you should try not to run ahead with population too far to avoid unemployment: both tracks are closely linked and important in order to avoid penalties and score points.

This Sim City clone is certainly more different than some of the others.  You spend the first part of the game with a negative score, basically trying to limit how many negative points you're going to get in order to build up your city.  I think it's pretty neat and accurate thematically.  It's also much heavier than Suburbia and I think the 90 min game time is pretty misleading as well.  Still, it's an interesting game and does what it does in a pretty unique way.  Not sure if I'll keep it as I do like Suburbia, so additional plays may be needed.

This is very much SimCity: The Board Game.  I enjoyed the theme and the mechanisms definitely meld with it, but there is A LOT of bookkeeping that is necessary during each turn and after each era for scoring. Analysis paralysis will definitely rear it's ugly head regularly as players try to figure out the best tile.  This slows down several phases of the game.  There are so many variables to consider and the relationships aren't really obvious, so it's really difficult and time-consuming to figure out what the most beneficial play should be. In the end, this game is kind of like trying to balance an equation containing about a dozen or more variables! It is quite the challenge, but the overall play time is definitely a bit much for me.

Excellent components, great gameplay. My only complaint is the scoring system: so much "negativity!" The designer could have easily minimized the minus points, using positive points sooner on the population and worker tracks, since the final point difference would have been the same. 

EDIT: After a 4P school game, I am so VERY annoyed with the negative point system that I lowered the rating to an 8 and dropped it 15 places and out of my Top 20 (was #16.) Loved the mechanisms. Will probably take a sharpie to the board and redo all the scoring.

This was a fine city building tile drafting game.  In this game each player is trying to build the best city that needs to balance many different criteria like the economy, unemployment, reputation, etc.  Each round players will be bidding for draft order and then buying tiles in that draft order to put into their city.  The cities each have immediate and often continuous effects much in the same vein as Suburbia.  Often they will trigger off of which kinds of other city tiles you have in your city or later build into it.

I think in the end that's why I consider this just fine and somewhat forgettable.  It feels very similar to Suburbia but Suburbia in my opinion is the better and more refined game.

RATING: N/A
I wish the game had more interesting decisions to take. More options available to build from, too. I don't mind the fact that players play solitaire but with Capitals, I don't find it exciting in terms of differentiating strategies.

Playing time was also a bit over the top, taking 3 hours with 4 players. The effort of making this kind of game is excellent as it's for sure a very admirable task to balance all the small nuances the game has to offer within each building.

Solid civ game that hits just the right amount of buttons (not too many, not too few) - I liked the game more than I thought I would.

The board is somewhat dreadful (it's just tracks), but the artwork on the tiles is excellent.

It can also be difficult to keep track of each building's effect in your tableau, so you will have to inventory with each new build and activation.

A well-designed game, I purchased a copy after our first play.

This was being touted as a heavy city building euro. Sounds right up my alley! The amount of pages in the rulebook sounds a bit daunting, but actually the rules are quite straight forward. The first couple of rounds wend swimmingly. After that things started slowing down. That was mostly due to me having the feeling that if I played just on gut feeling - which I mostly do - I wouldn't stand a chance. So I started planning and calculating. The problem is that with every round the amount of combinations keeps on increasing so the game slows down as the players have to keep track of more and more combos. It reminded me of [thing=123260][/thing], but slower and more fiddly. You build a tableau of tiles with abilities which can make combos and influence each other. But it's way more tedious to play. I think there's a good game hidden in there, but it lacked development to streamline it. Like that street cross that has to be moved. It doesn't add much to the game.
I was also quite annoyed by the turn order mechanism. If you're in last place and have tonnes of money, that won't do you any good if the players in front all make sure to stay in front of you. Which means there is nothing you can do to make sure you get that tile you really, really need.
So I really wanted to like this game, and I don't hate it either, but it didn't live up to it's potential.

Initial rating: 6.5/10
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Potentially massively imbalanced and with very little in the way of long term planning this is 2+ hours of tactical reactions to the tiles that come up.

It wasn't unfun and certainly exceeds Suburbia in every way, but I won't be desperately rushing back to play this.

Randomly being screwed out of being able to build purple buildings is somewhat addressed by not having to be alone in having the most of something, but instead only having to tie for most. Oddly, this doesn't occur with all tiles; how am I meant to have the least power if someone else has just spent all of theirs? This unintentional (and basically impossible to predict/combat) blocking sours the taste a little, but there's a decent game here under the morass of icons and ugly board design.

RATING: 6
Great biding for the player order. If you will be first, you probably have to pay very mych if you would to like first in another round. Like the crosses - if you don`t build by the crosses you wil lose points, if you don`t buy adjencent to the same colour you will lose ponts. So its important where you will place the crosses.

The game is to long (we play a 3P in 3h!). I think there are to few buildings in "the market" (too little to choose). As the game goes on its hard to see what you have in your display.

The game reminds Suburbia, is maybe little more complex.

City-and civbuilding - those are probably my most sought for topics in boardgames, but also they are the hardest to get done right. Because once you have to keep track of all the characteristic micromanagement a computer would do for you, in 99 of 100 cases it's the theme that starts to suffer and disappears into the background. Only once in a decade (maybe) a game with this very specific theme manages to still maintain that feeling the theme suggests instead of just optimising your "engine". This is where the wheat separates from the chaff. And in my opinion this is also where this game fails. You have six tracks to keep an eye on. And the feeling that I get when playing this game is the one of a sound engineer in front of a mixer panel. While pulling some levers, some other levers go down. Go down a little too much maybe, so I'll adjust those levers again for a better setting. Perfect example for an engine optimiser. It wasn't until the very end I saw my botanical garden as a botanical garden and my park as a park for instance. In mid-game I saw them as "red", other buildings as "blue" and so on. 
That being said, I think you should know that this game is a good game nonetheless. Engine building game that is. In the beginning it is very hard to gain culture, tourists are a crucial component. They, most of all, give you much needed flexibility in regards of activating your buildings/structures. Stating that money is important for the sole purpose of bidding on the iniative track is simply wrong. For lots of era III and even some era II buildings you need tons of money if you desire to activate (or buy) them. 
Two things I didn't like about the design:

- Bidding order: With the leftmost player on the bidding track I was able to stay starting player for the last 5 consecutive rounds with no opponent having a chance to alter this situation. I don't have a solution for this. Bidding from right to left in play order would make for a scripted order something in the likes of 5/4/3/2/1-1/2/3/4/5-5/4/3/2/1- and so on
- Last player compensation. At the start of the game the last player is already at a disadvantage when it comes to choosing from the remaining buildings. AND: It's very likely for you to lose your tourist  during the first round(s) of the game in case you're the last player and you can't do anything about it. Why not have phase 3 (check highest culture for tourism) go into effect from, for example, the start of era II ongoing? Or just say that the tourist doesn't change owners at least during the first round of the game?

I love city/engine/tableau building. I think this one does it the best. The game relies on a great tension. There's more tracks than any player can possibly keep up with. Nothing can be ignored, but you also want to specialize in something. It's a great line to try to balance.

The initiative system needs fixing: The guy who goes first chooses initiative first, and once everyone has a good flow of money, they keep buying the same positions so turn order doesn't change.  A five player game took us about 3 hours, not 90  minutes.

A bit outdated from a game mechanics standpoint. Negative points were infuriating. Has an interesting "push tracks for points" mechanic but is otherwise a very thinly veiled game of moving pieces along arbitrary tracks in different directions. Love the art tho.

Buildings were brutal and impossible to predict making long-term planning a crapshoot. So many buildings! So there was no control. Zero fun. Building the city also felt like a chore. Our scores were wildly different and for 33% of the game, zero population increase tiles came out. 

May try again, but easily the most disappointing first play I've had in 2014.

I like city building games. I like tile laying games. I like SimCity. I've looked for a city building tile laying game that feels like SimCity for a long long time. The Capitals is IT! This feels like it's about at the SimCity 2000 level which is one of the best smoothest playing games in the series. It kicked the game up from a simple little resource mgr to something that had you really managing the nuances of your city and this game does that. Great decisions to be made and wonderful building interactions make this just a fun game to sit down to. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Capitals has a fairly basic idea... you're building in your city every turn, and then activating one or more buildings, and at the end of the game you see who's done the best at building their city (based mostly on population and employment).  Somewhere between the idea and the execution the game gets a little more opaque.  There's an iconography language that you have to learn to play the game, which while the iconography is pretty straightforward, it's a lot to take in at first.  The game is all about the buildings you can build, and every building is covered in icons.  And after you figure out the iconography, you'll have to figure out how to translate which buildings make the game do what you want to do.

Also, the game starts you out losing a ton of points right off the bat and it's easy to lose points all over the place if you're not careful.  So a large part of the early game (possibly through to the late game if you're not doing well) is trying to stem the flow of negative points and start getting back to zero.  By the end of the game though you should be able to come out of the hole and be scoring a lot of points.

I really enjoyed the idea of the game.  The first play was a little bit of a walk in the dark for us, but I think next plays

This is a game that works just as fine with 2 people as it does with 4. Maybe slightly better, in fact. This game is nice in that it's a pretty quick city builder, I finished a 2 player game in 2 hours. Players won't take that long to make their turn. But half the time you hardly feel like you're in direct competition with the other player, since so little of what you do effects them. You can take things away or ensure that you get a certain building, but generally there's enough variety that it's not too much of a factor. Also, playing with the bonus buildings (whatever they're called) is extremely highly recommended. Very good for giving direction to your strategy and the game. Without the bonus buildings this game might have been a tad tedious.

Even though I played with a major rule explained wrong, the game was still unnecessarily tedious. It felt like something made by someone who really loved Suburbia (and maybe Powergrid because of the energy cube "activation" of tiles?) and wanted to extrapolate on the idea. The placement of tiles is more interesting than in Suburbia because you have less limitation but it's not enough to make me want to play this again.

I had always wanted a city building game.  When I heard of Suburbia and all the buzz surrounding it, I was very excited.  Then I finally played it and I was a little let down.  So I started doing some research on the genre and decided that this was the game for me… and I was right!  It is a struggle and a challenge to get a city up and running that is a well oiled machine, but that is part of the challenge.  There is a low amount of player interaction, but what is there is crucial.  I really am happy with this addition to my collection and I look forward to future plays.

I like quite a lot about this game: the planning of the Construction Tokens, the various resources and tracks, the interplay amongst the buildings and activations, and the rivalry between the players.

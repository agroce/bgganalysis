Kinda disappointed with this game. Not very fun, plays more like Monopoly than a strategy game. Basic rules of the game are easy to learn, so is a good game for kids. Overall, not very fun, challenging, or even one to keep.

The publisher claims that the game is somehow light, but it is likely to be seen as heavier than that.  A primary reason for this is game length, which is much more than the 75 minute duration listed.  Expect the game to take a considerable amount of time, especially in the earliest plays and with new players.  The concept of following Alexander around doing his busy work is a little less grand than players may want and may even make players feel like the game is playing them as much as the other way round.  I'm not sold on the overall game, but I think there are some interesting elements in the design.

Pure strategy with no randomness. Anticipating your opponents' strategy is of the essence.
Better than expected.

RATING: 6.5
Not the wargame it looks like.  The game is a solid design, with different considerations to be made in each of the six game turns/areas.  There is sufficient scope for different tactics to prevail, however the perfect information available at the time of placing the playing pieces resulted in an acute case of analysis paralysis and playing by committee.  Interesting enough to play again - but not too often.

RATING: 5
Reasonable game. It felt like the choices were a bit  limited and if I'm going to play a game like this, I'll play Taj Mahal instead.  My game group like it because it's about Alexander the Great, although the game itself could be about anything as the theme is unimportant to the mechanics.  Actually, it's nothing to do with Alexander the Great really.  It's more to do with running the empire he creates.

Good game.  The map is divided in different regions and in every region you take a fresh start.  So if you failed in one region, you can try to succeed in an other region.  Also a good interaction between the player.  It's not a game to play with 2 persons, the best is with 4, 5 is too crowded.

I finished modding this game in a fusion with Alexandros. The 55 cards, helmets and oblongs were used. This nice map needs some oponnents and a few logic battles without dice. The movement of your enemies, is solved with 6 logical dice. King Darius III. and the indian king Poros is well dissolved by rolling 4 to 6x1D6. It function, cause all territories are numbered. The players represent Alexander´s generals and i added 8 counters with their own abbilities. Memnon and Bessus are some of your general opponent and the cities of Halikarnassos and Tyre to siege are introduced as well. It´s actually a kind of coop-game and you fell like Men at war marching first onto Egypt and then sweeping onto  Persepolis, the persian headquarter.

Stunning production quality - I felt almost ashamed to be playing an abstract Euro on such a beautiful map board.  Cleverly done, progressive area majority game with some interesting twists and particularly clunky turn order mechanism which, combined with the uber-harsh destructive ties, makes this one sour a bit on my palate.  The gameplay makes me wish there was a modular board or series of boards, while the board it /has/ makes me wish I was pushing a bunch of chits around and killin' stuff.

This looks like a wargame, but it ain't. In fact in this game players ALL represent the armies of Alexander, simply trying to get the best of the spoils of conquest. The rules are relatively simple but the game can be very fiddly, as after the secret cube placement is revealed your move can be calculated, which can take quite a long while when playing with uber-geeks. Still, there are no obvious faults with this game, and the mechanics themselves are logical and interesting, without being amazingly new. The map, large as it is, still creates a lot of fiddling around with your pawns that constantly hide the temple and city symbols. Interestingly only a small part of the map is ever used at one time. Not a game for the grognard but for the Euro gamer who wants some VERY light historic flair, but basically this could have been a game about many things. Still, a better than average game, as one would expect from Phalanx.

It's an okay game, the basic mechanism and play work. But wildly overproduced, a huge map and yet the actual contested regions are too small for all the pieces. Little cubes, wood temples, wood cities, tiny arrows and numbers, borders, drawings of temples and cities, all crammed into about 20% of the total board. Very fiddly to control, and ultimately not a fun game. It's okay, but I would not call it a success.

I had many reservations about this game after reading the rules and fishing around for clarifications (thanks Jim_Pulles!).  But in the end, we were all pleasantly surprised.  The game can be an AP delight but it plays reasonably fast and once you know what you're doing, there are many subtilities here.  The turn order is key but not so much that everything hinges around it.  Going first is essentially an invitation to have your plan getting medievaled, but you can force your opponents into unfavorable decisions.

There are a couple of interesting ideas in this area control game, but overall it feels a little static. There is just a bit too much self-balancing, partly because early builds are so much more expensive than later builds, partly because of how turn order works, and partly because it's so easy to create ties that prevent anyone from doing anything. Lots of king-making opportunities, too.

Something like a cross between El Grande and Vinci.  The breakdown of the map into different sectors made the game easier, as there was only a small portion of the map to consider at any given time.  Played once with three.  Five players could be insane, but in a good way...

RATING: 6
The rules are riddle with problems, the map has some odd features, but the game itself is actually kind of interesting. It took us way too long to muddle through the rules (including one really bad misprint that was very confusing), but once we got it, things flowed fairly smoothly. Played with three, which seemed about right. Any more than that could make the game drag even more. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
We had a lot of problems figuring this game out, but I think it's because a question came up where the rules were being explained and we started arguing it. But, the rule was for a part of the game near the end of the round. So, we worked backwards and had to rethink a lot of it. I rated it a 7, because once we got the game going it started making sense. I think it will be an fun area majority game that will play fairly quickly. Although, it seems like some games will go quickly and some games might delay a bit.

Still it seems like a fun little area 'majority' game.

Rating after one game (two-player), which I don't usually do, but this was very disappointing.  The only tension is in laying our resources; once the resources have been revealed, it's pretty clear what each player can do for that region.  The actual play seems to be going through the motions.  I'm sure this is a better game with more players.

RATING: 6
Good 3 player.

I liked this.  I was expecting the worst from other people's ratings but this is definitely my type of game.  The hidden allocation is a great feature & distinguishes this from other multiplayer games that I have played.

The consequences of player actions were interesting (such as triggering the end of action in a region) & I liked the multiple types of majority scoring that occur as well as the importance of turn order.

Note the "official" variant: at the end of the game score 5VP for the most cities + temples in each region (instead of scoring for temple & city majority separately).

Played this game once with 5 players. The concept & graphics are very nice. The rules are easy. When you play this game you play six regions (great turns with 3 subturns for each player). When I was playing I had the strange feeling I was playing six times the same game. The only thing that was changing was that my strategy was getting better. Overall I think its a fun game but not that good.

After one play my rating is only 'average.'  I think that the person who suggested that the game starts to fail with four or five players was right.  By the last few regions it just became a guessing game.

A recommended variant:  Start with 20 resources each and deduct one from your pool to maintain each City and Temple you build.  As the game progresses you will have fewer and fewer resources to allocate, and the players who have built the most will even have less, making their decisions that much more important.

Not a game that I'd suggest, but not one that I'd refuse to play either...

2 plays.  This is merely an okay game, unfortunately.  In both games I've played, the last place player had little chance to come from behind.  Now, that's not unusual in games, but their position was fairly constant after about the second turn.  This is typically not a good sign.  The game board is very nice, though.  I would play again, with the understanding that somebody will likely be totally disinterested after the halfway point.

Only played 2-player games so far. As a 2-player game it is a brainburner with no luck involved at all. I like it! Also quit unique in the way the turns succeed by playing every turn in a different region on the map.

03/13/10 Played a four-player game. The game's components were OK overall, with the exception of the screens, which were about half the height they should have been. I see no excuse for this. The box has plenty of room for larger screens. The other weird thing were the city cubes. They looked too much like the resource cubes. A slightly larger cube with a dot on top of it doesn't reek "city" to me. They were already using Settlers of Catan settlements as temples, they could have just as easily used Settlers wooden cities for cities in this game. I look forward to playing it again.

RATING: 6
Only 2 plays, but it feels like the end-game scoring forces you into a strategy from the get-go, which you can't afford to abandon. Which means if one person gets to a significant lead in one aspect (cities or temples) by being left alone, there's not much anyone can do but play it out, even though the game's already in effect resolved. Could be completely wrong, but there's nothing exciting enough to tempt me into going back and proving it for myself.

A game that looks gorgeous, the board is simply fantastic. It's a majority area control game that works for very high tension. Due to extremely limited resources, this game works on very difficult decision making. This game is very tough to master and definitely for more advanced players.

Hit it on the table again after a long time, it was really awesome! New strategies have surfaced. Choosing to go first at times seemed to have been a critical matter! 3 player game worked fantastic!

- Surprisingly short rulebook, but you have to pay attention, could have been slightly better written. Once you know the rules though, it's easy to teach, but tough to master.

OK area-majority resource-management game. It looks cool, plays well, with tense fights. I do have some issues with it that make me rate this lower than other area-majority games (a mechanism I'm not really a fan of).

Most importantly, you spend a turn, maybe two, in a region, and then you move on, never to revisit that region. What you do in a region doesn't affect future regions. There's no bonus if you don't do well in a region, and you can't 'skip' a region for future benefits. So there's no long-term strategy, in the sense that it's a series of fights, and every time you just throw everything you got at it and hope it'll be enough.

Playing last is devastatingly important. Blind bidding, where everyone loses their bids, determines who can play last. So if you throw half your resources at it, and someone else bids half+1, you're screwed. If you manage to play last, you can't plan while other people are playing their turn. Just sit back and wait until they've made their move, then grab as many points as you can.

There just isn't much of a back-and-forth play, as you might expect. Bid cubes, place cubes, cross your fingers, move on to the next region. That's basically it. I wish there were more maps, with bigger regions, other stuff to fight over, a way to return to earlier regions, &c. This could have been a very good game...

RATING: 2
Rating based on first game with 5 player but because of the dry, creaky mechanic of moving armies, working out costs of building temples and cities means there will always be some downtime, so I honestly can't rate it higher. Nice map though.

The game includes elements of Web of Power/China and even a bit of Wallenstein. It is a near flawless design. Works best with three players.

RATING: 7
One 5-player game. Plays well but the final scoring may be overpowered.... or have a plan and be very aware of who might attain those final scoring bonuses. Too many campaigns ended after the 1st round; not sure how to alleviate this. And maybe tied players should split the points to add a little spice to a game where there is precious little to do each turn.

Based on playing 1/2 a game.  And that was too much.  Do something not terribly exciting, then do it again. And again.  And again.  All the time only using a tiny section of the board, which made it unecessarily fiddly.  I think faced with the same thing again, I'd spend half my time drunk and hoping for an early death.

This is an interesting design, perhaps let down by its theme: do not come here expecting conquest. The turns have two phases: a hidden allocation phase, and then an open action phase where the turn order (bid for in phase one) is critical. There is the opportunity for some subtle play here, and the open action phase lifts the game well beyond the standard blind bidding affair as you can (and must) monkey with your allocations during this phase. There is however considerable chaos, and group think can be important: in two games we have not had one campaign go more than 2 rounds. I find it a surprisingly difficult game to evaluate due to the subtlety and group think.  A bit of conquest feel would really lift my rating: even something simple such as making the travel costs be neutral cubes you need to defeat. Played fast I think it is a good game, with the right group it might be a great game, and it is one where my rating might still go up.

Interesting mechanics in a middle-weight game. Blind allocation of resources and the price you pay for a temple/city depends on who else is trying to do the same thing. With four players it seemed like a 2 on 2 game with 2 goinf for temples and 2 going for cities. Might be more interesting with 5.

RATING: 4
The mechanism of the game is quite a decent one, and if you're willing to overlook the imaginary theme, then it's a good challenging area/objective majority game. The only thing this has to do with Alexander the Great is the map - well, so, it's not the only game I've got like that. The variable number of turns in a region is quite good. Each of the six regions is like a new game board in itself. The starting of each region afresh, but with the regions carrying over into a final scoring, this tends to keep everyone in the hunt. I don't see myself rating it any more than a six, but it's a game where the rules are easy enough for me to remember and therefore pick the game up off the shelf a couple of times a year. Better than I had thought after reading the rules through, and the gaming group was quite forgiving of using the first region to sort out a few rules questions - luckily the turn order is not as confusing as I had first thought... just on the first turn... when all the rules are still being understood... sigh...

Underrated, in my opinion.  This is a cool area control game with a nice blind bidding mechanic thrown in.  I would agree that it's a bit prone to AP, since after the bidding process, you have perfect information, but I think it offers some interesting choices for how to make the most of what you bid at the beginning.  It is that piece of the analysis that I find most enjoyable about this game.  My guess is that it shines with five because of all the contention, and that it would be too wide open with fewer players.  The rules have some confusing points, and I think the alternative endgame scoring would make things more interesting (5 points for most temples+cities).

An area majority game that might have been very good ten years ago, but now it's only average at best. 
It's not really a cohesive game, but rather six mini games packed into one. The six regions could have been played in any order you would like, as there is no connection between them whatsoever. The're only joined in the final scoring for having the most buidlings of each type on the board, but that's not enough in my book.

Played it, want to play it again, the rules are quite simple, but fun...the 75 minutes are BS though, this is a rather long game...but great to play...one error in the rules...the turn order example is not correct, or at least not very clear, which  sucks cuz the turn order is very important.I think we finaly found out how they are meant to be read...i hope...

Tense area majority game. Unusual mechanism for determining turn order / pieces on the board / pieces to spend. Initial game ran somewhat longer than advertised. As the game progressed, we could see there was an interesting timing factor: trying to make your opponents overspend, so that you could achieve your plans cheaper next turn.

I disliked Alexander the Great, but it's going to be tough to define exactly why. It's not because of the blind resource allocation mechanic that really seems to turn people off ... I actually kinda like that. But something about the timing and the compact nature of the regions just didn't appeal to me. I think I also did not like that it's clearly better to build temples and cities than to try for province points with larger armies. That cuts down on what should have been a viable strategy and makes the game less interesting. But overall, the game just leaves me feeling vaguely dissatisfied, to the point where I will actively avoid this in the future.

Rating based on one play with 5 players.  With this many players, each region lasted the minimum number of turns, because the competition for building sites is too intense and at least one player feels like it is in their best interest to end the region.  Also, there were too many ties.  I think this one might have a sweet spot at 4 players, and will try it again, but it didn't excite me.

Nice components, simple rules. But the game is a brain teaser. There is a lot of thinking here. Everyone can play this game but only few can really play to win. Most people will be very disappointed playing this game. But people that like fast and deep strategy will say that this a hidden gem. You need to play with the revised scoring when a campaign is over.

It is said to be a luckless game (but luck is there, after all, you can guess what the others will do, but you can't know for sure how many workers/soldiers they will put where, though can be called "fog of war", "bluff" and so on, it still touches the luck factor).

I don't liked it, but there are plenty of worst games out there.

One play, with 5.  Rules not complicated, but rulebook poorly written and we spent a while wrongly determining turn order.  Turn order (last to place armies) is very important because you have perfect information about the preceding players' ability to score that turn, and is determined by blind bidding. It moved along quite fast, but once you've placed, you can walk away from the board until the next turn since there is almost no forward planning to do.  I'll give an initial 6, as there is very much a game here, though it didn't grab me.

NOT A WARGAME! It's a solid 7 Eurogame of bluffing, area majority, and blind bidding.  There are plenty of avenues to follow for point scoring but going last in this game is probably the best place to be depending on how you allocated your resources.  Great wooden bits in the box with a nice map that follows Alexander's conquest.  The theme fits the game play well.  Blind bids may not be for everyone.

I enjoyed this game with 3, and hope to play again with more. A very nice area majority game. I know some have griped about the fact that you are only playing in one small area of the board at any one time. But I think having 6 separate regions with their unique geographies adds to the game.

I like bluffing, I like rolling dice. It's like peanut butter and chocolate. & It's the ultimate bar game.

Bonus points for component simplicity - all you need is $3 worth of dice.

My game group plays with both the rerolls and with the lose as many dice as you were wrong.  Its ok, but basically a math exercise.  I am very much hoping that Skull and Roses supplants this game, because I prefer the bluffing part.

Played a few times and I have to say it hasn't clicked nearly as well as I thought it would.  I guess its just a filler but I had hoped for a little more with the bluffing element.  

Update:  I was playing with the wrong rules (I was only throwing out one die if you're wrong, I miss read the rules that you have to throw out as many dice as you are wrong by).  Much better game (surprise?)

When I play this game with newbs and Eurogamers, there are the inevitable complaints about bad rolls. The next round I proceed to tell them exactly what they've rolled on the dice they are hiding.

"Bu...bu...but, dice are random," they insist.

"And yet the likelihood of you losing isn't," I reply.

Winning this game is not about the dice. It's about figuring out how your opponents think.

RATING: 7
Very simple but a lot of fun. Works well in larger groups. Only negative is that the rules change (slightly) halfway through. I hate that. Also, as players are eliminated they'll sit there the rest of the game. Not a fan of that either.

So it captures two gaming elements that I dislike the most. Still a fun play if you keep it moving along.

Own 2 sets of Dudo, set all in one box.

I'm kind of ambivalent on this game.  It's a great party game for large groups.  Everyone enjoys tossing the dice and making their guesses.

Most of the game is simply an exercise in "guess how many 6s there are on the table.  bid slightly less, so it doesn't come back around to you".  The endgame is more bluffing and second guessing though, if you stay alive long enough to get there.

This game is more fun than I thought it would be.  Similar to Lair's Poker, a game not listed.  I prefer Liar's Poker for 2 players.Liar's Poker:For two players, deal 7 cards to each.  Players take turns naming better & better 5-card poker hand until one player contests.  The hand is valid if it can be made with the 14 cards between the two players.  Kind of a mind-**c*.  My Lair's Dice rating is also a rating for Lair's Poker.

I was not the first person to go out, but I was the second.  I didn't mind making bold assertions.  Though I lost because of questioning other people when they were right.  My husband was masterful at psyching people and getting them out... but he didn't win either in the end.  It's an OK filler, but not really my kind of game, even though it has lots of dice.  I'm not one of finding statistics on the fly to be fun.  I prefer my story games to be random... not my dice games.

RATING: 8
A fun gambling-ish game.  Probabilities and the like.  Many opportunities for bluffing.

Rating raised from 6 to 7 (4/09/09).  Initially I didn't think there was enough non-gambling meat here to really hold my attention, but this one has grown on me.  It's fast and easy, not  too much of a brain-burner, and flows rather nicely.  The lack of strategy and depth keeps this from being a 9 or 10, but it is excellent for what it is -- a pseudo-gambling dice game.

Raised to an 8 (9/27/13).  I've played so much of this that I appreciate its careful balance between strategy and luck.  Regardless of what you do, the game wins.  We're all just along for the ride.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I played this game just twice, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

A light and very simple bluffing game, that gets such high praise from many gamers.

I don't usually like bluffing games like this one, that don't offer a good basis for your arguments, but I surprisingly enjoyed it. It's a good light game to spend a few minutes together by rolling some dice. What I dislike however is how easily you can get screwed by the turn order. It doesn't happen too much, but it's definitively going to happen a few times during every play.

This game genre might not usually be my cup of tea, but Liar's Dice is a nice exception to that rule. It's still chaotic and hard to control, but it's surprisingly enjoyable. Nice game!

A great party game for drinkers.  There's enough bluffing to keep the grifters happy, but the randomness helps to keep more timid players in the game.  I play with a group full of dirty liars and people who play it straight nearly every roll, and both groups enjoy this one.

RATING: 5
It's kind of fun to play. It has a certain charm to it. But it doesn't work incredibly well as a game. You spend a lot of the game hoping to "miss" difficult decisions and thus not get knocked out. But there is also some fun in forcing other people into difficult decisions. Best played when you really just want to shake some dice.

A game that is so much fun after so many plays and so many years deserves a 10. If there is one bluffing game, then this is the one to be. It has all I wishes in this type of game: clever statistical calculations, die rolls that don't stick to it, psychology, bluffing, involvement and plenty of group interaction.

Simple, fun, and pretty replayable.  I used to be pretty hot on this game, but it lost a bit for me somewhere along the way.  When it gets down to heads up play, the lead-off six bets are pretty difficult to fade.  I'm not hot on the calls where everybody loses 1 either, but I guess it's part of the fun.  Love the re-roll rule.  Wish "Perudo" with its six colored cups and dice had a built-in board!

This game features tons of randomness, little concrete information to work with, random end-game, and a positive-feedback system that continues to punish/limit players who lost dice (undoubtedly from a decision based on their gut feeling).

A good beer and nuts game. I like it but the females in my group don't!? One problem can be that once you're out, you pretty much lose interest in what's happening (maybe that's the beer). It can be a great bluff game and good players can really stitch others up. My friends version has indians in place of ones which is much cooler than my set.

A baráti körömben ez a partijáték aratott eddig talán legnagyobb sikert. Nagy kamugépekkel vagyok körülvéve:) Nagyon agresszíven szoktuk kezdeni, 5-6 fő esetén kapásból 10 feletti vállalással indítunk. Azt hittem, itt számít valamit a valszám, de már nyert olyan is, aki nem is értette a szabályokat. Ő teljesen kiszámíthatatlanul kamuzott:)
---
Kipróbáltuk a Perudo névek kiadott változatot is. Ez azért kicsit más: 35 helyett csak 30 kocka van, 6 különböző színben (a régebbi blöffben 35 kocka volt, tehát azt elvileg 7 fő is játszhatta, bár ott is csak 6 pohár volt). A Perudoban mást kell bemondani blöff helyett, és ha valakinek 1 kockája marad, akkor kap egy kis védettséget, erre van egy külön szabály. Ezenkívül itt nincs tábla, az elvesztett kockákat titkosan gyűjtjük egy zsákban. Ja és a Jóker kedvéért nem lett külön dobókocka gyártva, a hagyományos kocka 1-ese számít Jokernek.

[COLOR=#959595][SIZE=7]Deutscher Spiele Preis 4th Place 1993[/SIZE][/COLOR]

[i]Posted: 3/29/07, Rated: 6[/i]

[i]Liar's Dice[/i] is a simple game that is easy to teach.  Roll the dice by turning your cup upside-down, take a peek, and then try to guess how many dice display a certain number under [i]all[/i] of the cups.  The game even made a celebrity appearance in the movie [i]Pirates of the Caribbean 2: Dead Man's Chest.[/i]

Instead of having 1 pip on one side of each die, the dice in the [company=562]Endless Games[/company] version have stars.  These act as wild cards, raising the amount of any particular number.  Wild stars can also be used as their own bid.  As the stakes rise, bidding a number of stars feels like a cop out: three stars may seem easy, wihle a raise requires a minimum of six of any number (or four stars).  A bid of four stars can only be raised by eight of something else (or five stars), etc.

For a long time, my family and I were playing incorrectly: each person that lost a challenge would only lose one die, as opposed to losing the number of dice by which his challenge was incorrect.  This misunderstanding resulted in a more enjoyable game, in our experience, as it kept people from being eliminated too quickly.

The Endless Games version takes up a lot of [i]space;[/i] this game could be stored in a much smaller box, if the nearly-vestigial board could fold.  As my collection grows, my sensitivity to wasted space increases as well.

[i]Liar's Dice[/i] is a decent party game, and can basically scale up to more players than are provided in the Endless Games version.  There isn't a lot of downtime for the active players, which is a good thing.  Still, if I'm looking for a quick, dice fest filler game, I'd rather break out [i][thing=15818]Pickomino[/thing][/i] instead.

What makes this game work is a variant where you can reveal any number of dice that you are bidding (wilds included) and then any dice you have not revealed you must re roll and these remain secret to only you.  On future turns any dice revealed must remain public and unchanged for the rest of the round.  This allows for better bidding and also adds to the fun factor as you are able to change you fate by rolling again.  Fun as long as you keep the game moving!

This game rings of classic gaming with it's simple design and components that could be assembled DIY style (four cups and 20 dice). From the simple rules comes a brilliant bluffing game full of head faking, double thinking, and to some extent, math. Cheap, clever, addictive. What more do you want?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
p: this has to get a few massive thumbs up as it isn't only fun to play, it is also one of the very few games that can be played by more than 6 players at once, making it a great game to wind up the night when turn-out has been superb. To me it adds something to the night if the last (wind-down) game is played by all around one busy table. The relaxed banter that triggers usually also takes some beating.

For the game, it does play pleasantly quick, and turns come around speedily, although with 6 or more players it can take a while for your turn to come back when a few bets are called and turned out to be bluffs. It's great with players who are well honed up on their basic statistics.

We play the version that allows for rerolls of a the dice that remain in the player's cup, when that player reveals at least one die that underpins the current call by placing it in front of the cup. This pushes the odds up slightly, and usually adds to the tension when the slightly more optimistic odds are being taken. 

However, as with all elimination games, it is usually best for the last 3 players, and seriously pants for those who have to bottle out first. Nevertheless, great game overall and it's hard to find elimination games that are better for all.

Not without it's flaws, this may still be the best dice filler around. Plays more interestingly with a table full, but scales in that automatic way last-man standing games do... it'll more than likely be 4 handed at some point... then 3... then 2... still enjoy it best when there's a crowd and wouldn't suggest it otherwise. 

Not a huge fan of the "exacto" fail where everyone loses a dice... nor do i really know how I feel about the dice loss penalty as either a static 1 die loss or the difference in actual vs bid.

RATING: 8
Perudo is a great bluffing dice game.  There is a healthy dose of luck thrown in because of the dice, but a smart bidder can usually get around that.  I love that it works well with almost any age group.  In fact the rules are so simple and straightforward that it often takes on the feel of a party game.  What makes the game great is just the tension you feel as you attempt to bluff your opponents without knowing what they hold.  It sounds so simple that you'd think the game lacked any strategy at all.  However there is a lot of clever tactics involved in knowing how to bid, and when to bid aces.

If I were to complain about the game, it would have to be the player elimination that bothers me most.  Sometimes a player will get eliminated early and will be forced to sit as the rest of the players finish the game.  It's not too bad, since the game can be relatively quick, but sometimes it will annoy people.  There are also different versions of this game that have added rules.  I think I'd like to try the Liar's Dice rules at some point, because the opportunity to re-roll and the chance of multiple people losing dice on a turn is really intriguing.  Perudo is very basic, but still extremely fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I was first introduced to the Perudo version of this game, so it was really interesting when I came across Liar's Dice at a thrift store and found it had its own unique rules.  So I bought it and decided I needed to try out this version.  What I really enjoy about this version is the speed.  Since players lose dice much quicker the game can end in much less time.  I like that because it almost boils the game down to a short little filler that I'd be willing to play multiple times in a row.  I'm not 100% sold on the re-roll rules, because I'm not really sure how they improve the game.  It almost seems like they remove some of the lying and bluffing and just replace it with more luck.

The really bad part about this version is the components.  The board is beyond superfluous, to the point of just being annoying.  I would never play with it again unless I'm gaming with a group of younger kids who are having trouble following how the bidding works.  And these cheap plastic cups are so loud when the dice are banging around in them.  I might play with some of the new rules but with the Perudo components, that's how much I hate the cups that came with this version.  I also don't like how the dice are all generic, with Perudo everyone gets their own color.  All in all, I would choose a mash-up of Perudo with some Liar's Dice rules thrown in to create a more enjoyable experience.

RATING: 7
Liar’s Dice is the quintessence of a party game: you roll some dice, see the results, guess the other players’ results and try to bluff believably or catch any attempt at lying.

It’s so simple that even a non-gamer can understand how it works in less than one minute and, by the end of just a couple of rolls, even actively participate in the game, screaming with the others when wrong calls occur: nonetheless, as soon as you’ve understood how your opponents play, guessing gets either easily predictable or just a stroke of luck.

Liar’s Dice is a good game to bring in non-gamers though and to show them how much fun they could have should they start playing. (November 2011)

Edit: After further playing this game and enjoying it very deeply I raised my rating from 5.5 to 7.
As a matter of fact Liar's Dice is a very fun, social and appeasing filler: besides, what's better  in a game than noisily rolling dice?

Fun little game. Too bad that when you start losing a match you tend to keep on losing (fewer dice to bluff with). The game "shrinks" with every turn, since there are less dice in the game. I don't like that.

Okay bluffing game.  So far my win-loss ratio is 1-12 (I stink)... these were mostly 6 player games.  Seating order can be very important, and it helps to know (from experience) how far to push the bid so that it's unlikely to make it back around to you.

It's hard to give a rating less than 8 to a game I've played *so* much, but the truth is that Liar's Dice is for me something of a compromise game. It's not a game I'd ever actually suggest, and it's not something I ever get really enthused about playing - the game is just long enough for the player elimination problem to really suck, especially since the pattern is typically someone getting eliminated right off, with then a longer wait for the second elimination, and so on, so too many players sit around for too long.

On the other hand, it is a simple, clever, exciting, extremely accessible game that almost anyone can enjoy.

So I dunno. When trying to gently coax people to gaming, I think you can do a lot worse than Liar's Dice. But it's a tradition game, not a modern game, and there are better modern games.

The game essentially just boils down to predicting how many of a number amongst all players was rolled.  However, you can only see your dice, so you can only base your decision on what's under your cup, and what other people have predicted so far.  So, it really comes down to the bluff element!  You might say you think there are eight 5's, even though you personally have none of them in hopes of screwing someone over.

A very simple game that packs a lot of fun, and the moment where everyone reveals their dice can be a tense one!

RATING: 6
Very simple; always playable if a couple of dice are the only thing at hand.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The tension in the game is whether to call or raise, and if raising, to raise how high. Because the last thing you want is for your turn to come back around.

Another key question is, whether or not to name a raise because you have the dice to back it up, or because you don't.

As a traditional game, there are many variants that can be played with it. While I normally just play it straight up, I have played with partial reveals with rerolls, which is also fun, and the possibility of losing more than one die per round, which sounds like it could lead to some great bluffs, but in my experience did not and just made the game feel more random.

My set is some lovely cups I picked up in Bolivia for playing Dudo.

A good game based around nothing but rolling dice? Really? It's true though. Trying to math out the odds and figure out whether the friend sitting next to you actually has the dice he's implying makes for a great filler. Major complaint I have is snowballing effect: having less dice makes you less competitive, so an early bad start usually just gets worse. Gather up some dice and friends, and let's have some fun!

An excellent filler/party game. I think the Coyote/Pow-Wow system is a little better where you see everyone's information but your own, which brings the bluffing and doublethink more to the forefront, and there is less out and out guessing. But playing with dice is so much cooler, and it plays better across a range of people. Very fun.

Do you hear the 'Call of the Cups'? We never tire of this---it's always requested, it's always fun. When I lose, I don't care. When I win, I feel brilliant. What's better than that? I highly recommend the Perudo edition since the colored plastic cups and dice are great and the board is unnecessary.

Update 01/09: Not hitting the table much at all. At one point I really thought this was something we'd play on a monthly basis, but its been months since we've played and no one misses it.

Update 09/11: Haven't played in two years. What happened? Perhaps some fussing on different rules versions has haunted this one for us.

I now own a copy courtesy of a range of thrifted components and beautiful DIY pirate board from my good friends.

Liar's dice is a surprisingly good light filler for the family and for non-gamers. All the fun of bluffing at the poker table without the complexity of poker hands. It's a great light game that family members and non-gamers can enjoy, but even well-rounded gamers can enjoy this well-executed game of luck and bluff. I've played this game a dozen of times, and it's gotten me through the holidays with my family.

A good bluffing game that plays very quick. The bidding can get tense as you get near the end of each round, which to me is where the fun comes in even though I'm not good at it. For a quick game with a large group this is a great choice and I'm happy to play it on occasion. As usual I tend to be a horrible bluffer and wind up out very early on.

A quick bluffing game that has literally worked well with every group of friends I have, including non-gamers.

Interesting bluffing game using dice.  The random element is removed somewhat with the measure of information each player has (how many dice are in play and what their own dice are).  The game is really all about bluffing mixed with some strategy, in keeping yourself in the game and getting another player into a corner.  It also a fun easy game for non-gamers in your midst. (We just play with our own dice and homemade board.)

Pretty simple, but that makes it a good game to teach the non-gamers in your life. It's basic and classic enough to almost fill the "poker night" niche in your life, and will probably play better among the traitor or bluffing game lovers in your group. To me, though, it feels like the equivalent of the "ball on a string in a cup on a stick" game. Are we kicking a can down a 1920s rough-hewn road? Am I pushing a hoop with a stick down a country lane? Come on guys...I see Arkham Horror *right there* on the shelf. What are we doing with Liar's Dice?

Liar's Dice is a harmless and amusing light filler that can easily be played with just the dice...honestly, just cannibalize thrift store Yahtzees and similar dice-heavy games and you'll have this title.

As others have stated, basic probability analysis combined with a sense of when to bluff (or when other people are) is crucial to win here, much like Poker. Unlike Poker, this game isn't taken seriously and put on TV, which automatically makes it more appealing to me.

Light, psychological games like are never going to be among my absolute favourites, but Liar's Dice does enough things right to sound good once in a while, and it's short enough where I would be unlikely to refuse it. Has the side benefit of being easy to scrounge the components up for in any house with a handful of games.

On a side note, I prefer playing with wild boxcars and the ability to call "spot on" bids where a correct call makes everyone else lose a die. The latter is swingy at times, but it can make for some dramatic moments and can be useful when the table has been narrowed down to 2-3. I also consider it essential to play with players only losing one die per round at most, not the difference between the declaration and reality as some versions like Bluff use, as this makes the game way, way too random.

4 players is the real minimum on this, best with 5-6.

One play - wasn't particularly enamored of the game.  I suppose it didn't help that I lost three dice on the first round and was out on the third.  Short play time means I'd be willing to give it another go, but it's not something I'd ask for. **update** - played again, played three times and had a blast.  Observations:  Only played with four which helped improve the game, and the banter/trash talk made it more interesting ... and finally we played with a rule where you could reveal some of your dice but reroll the rest.  That made it much more interesting and I've bumped my rating up accordingly.  But it might be the kind of game where you need the right people.

RATING: 5
Simple game of bluff and a little psychology: the problem is often not determining yourself what would be shown on the dice, but rather asking yourself whether you believe the bid made by your predecessor. In the beginning you can apply statistics with some success, but as more and more dice disappear, you just have to be lucky. (Please do not make the mistake of applying probability theory to your decision when there are just a few dice left&mdash;the standard deviation will kill you.) Good game for 'winding down' after a long session of hard thinking.

KNIzudo

Muy en parte gracias al gran recopilatorio que hizo Raul_fr http://www.labsk.net/index.php?topic=27152.0 que trata sobre las variantes del Perudo http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/45/liars-dice me animo a escribir cómo sería el juego, visto por un fan de Knizia, eso sí, Knizia ya plasmó su versión del Perudo en forma de cartas con el juego Hochstapler.
Para el que no lo conozca, decir que es un juego que admite un buen número de jugadores, un buen número serían 10 personas o menos, y para hacerlo sólo se necesitan 5 dados por jugador, más un cubilete por jugador.
Es un juego muy sencillo que admite pequeñas reglillas y siguiendo la iniciativa del BSKudo, aquí lanzo mis reglas las cuales siguen en proceso de cambios.


REGLAS
Procedimiento de juego básico:
Cada jugador empieza con cinco dados de seis caras y un cubilete, y lanza sus dados manteniéndolos ocultos en el cubilete.
En su turno un jugador apuesta por un determinado número de dados y valor del dado, dando a entender que existe AL MENOS esa cantidad de dados con ese valor entre TODOS los jugadores. Por ejemplo: "cinco treses (5 x 3)".
El jugador inicial empieza con una apuesta y el jugador siguiente (se puede empezar en sentido horario o antihorario) debe subirla, y así va pasando el turno a cada jugador subiendo la apuesta hasta que alguno decide parar el juego para comprobar la apuesta del último jugador. SOLO puede para el juego el jugador al que le toca, ninguno otro.
Si resulta que la apuesta es cierta el jugador que ha parado el juego pierde una cantidad de dados, en caso contrario es el jugador que dijo la apuesta incorrecta quien pierde el dado.
Si un jugador pierde todos sus dados es eliminado.
El jugador que acaba de perder su dado empieza una nueva ronda como jugador inicial (si el jugador ha sido eliminado por perder el último dado, empieza el jugador siguiente), y el juego transcurre hasta que sólo queda un jugador con dados en la mesa que se declara ganador

Ases
El valor "1" (As) en el dado se considera comodín, en vez de decir 1, de modo que a la hora de determinar cuántos dados hay de cada valor, es obligatorio tener en cuenta el número de Ases. 
A los 1 les llamaremos Pacos.
No se puede hacer una apuesta inicial basada en Pacos.


Acciones en detalle:
En su turno un jugador puede:

1. Aumentar la apuesta:
1.1. Procedimiento habitual de subida de apuesta:
1.1.1. Subir la apuesta aumentando el número de dados. Pasar por ejemplo de decir "tres cuatros (3 x 4)" a "cuatro cuatros (4 x 4)" o "cinco cuatros (5 x 4)". Se permite cambiar el valor del dado a uno menor mientras se aumente el número de dados.
1.1.2. Subir la apuesta aumentando el valor del dado. Pasar por ejemplo de decir "tres cuatros (3 x 4)" a "tres cincos (3 x 5)" o "tres seises (3 x 6)".
1.1.3. Subir la apuesta aumentando el número de dados y el valor del dado. Pasar por ejemplo de decir "tres cuatros (3 x 4)" a "cuatro cincos (4 x 5)" o "cuatro seises (4 x 6)".

1.2. Conversión de la apuesta a/desde Pacos (Ases):
1.2.1. Convertir la apuesta a Pacos. Esto se hace dividendo el número de dados de la apuesta actual entre 2 y redondeando hacia arriba. Pasar por ejemplo de decir "tres cuatros (3 x 4)" a "dos Pacos (2 x 1)".
1.2.2. Convertir la apuesta de Ases a otro valor del dado. Multiplicando el número de dados por dos y sumando uno, es decir, mayor que el doble de dados. Pasar por ejemplo de decir "tres Pacos (3 x 1)" a "siete treses (7 x 3)".
1.2.3. Si la apuesta está en Pacos, el siguiente jugador puede seguir con Pacos, diciento al menos los mismos Pacos anteriores más uno.

1.3. La regla de la re-tirada: cuando queden dos jugadores, como una opción más en el turno, se puede sacar del cubilete un dado (o más de uno hasta que los acabe) para siempre (sea el número que sea) sin modificar su resultado, dejándolo a la vista, y puede volver a tirar el resto de dados en secreto que se quedarán ocultos) y aumentando la apuesta en número de dados manteniendo el mismo valor del dado (punto 1.1.1.). Los dados que se sacan quedan fijos y a la vista del resto de jugadores durante el resto de la ronda.

2. Parar el juego poniendo en duda la apuesta actual, la del último jugador.
Esta acción tiene un nombre especial de "DUDO" 
El jugador pone en duda que la apuesta actual sea verdad, se comprueba el total de dados y pierden dados, según se haya comprobado la apuesta. Si la apuesta es correcta el jugador que ha puesto en duda la apuesta pierde dados, en caso de que la apuesta sea falsa, es el jugador que subió hasta esa apuesta quien pierde dados.

¿Cuántos dados se pierden? Si el jugador tiene los 5 dados, pierde la diferencia de número de dados, se pueden perder todos los dados, por ejemplo si se dicen “ocho seises (8 x 6)” y había cinco seises (5 x 6)”, el jugador pierde 3 dados.
Siempre se pierde al menos un dado, por lo que si hay exactamente los dados que se dijo, se pierde un dado.
Si el jugador tiene menos de 5 dados, el jugador solo pierde un solo dado.
Si quedan 2 o 3 jugadores, sólo pierden de un dado en un dado aunque tenga los cinco dados.

3. Parar el juego indicando que la apuesta actual, la del último jugador, es exacta. 
Esta acción tiene un nombre especial de “EXACTO” El jugador dice que la apuesta actual es totalmente exacta, se cuenta el total de dados y si resulta que sale la cantidad de dados exacta, ni más ni menos, el jugador recupera uno de sus dados perdidos (hasta un máximo de cinco siempre) y el resto de jugadores pierden todos un dado aunque solo tengan uno. Pero si no es exacto, el jugador pierde un solo dado. El jugador que anunció el "EXACTO" inicia la próxima ronda fuera cual fuera el resultado de esta (o el siguiente jugador en caso de que hubiera perdido todos los dados).
No se puede usar el “EXACTO” cuando sólo hay dos jugadores.
Resalto que el “EXACTO” es una acción más que puede elegir el jugador cuando llega su turno.

4. Pasar. No se permite pasar.

5. Ronda especial “Calzone”. No se aplica, por no verle nada especial y por “complicarlo”.[/COLOR]

--
Retocar: el primer jugador eligue sentido horario o antihorio y ambien eligue jugar con pacos o sin pacos.

This is a very simple game of bluffing and one-upping your opponents.  There's also an element of pressing your luck, as you have to decide how high to push the bidding before you call someone out.

After playing both Perudo and Limits in the same weekend, I favor the latter, which involves just a bit more strategy.

Man, I just love this game. This game is one of my go-to games when playing with the non-gamers in my family. It has a lot of nostalgia for me too. I was a missionary for my church some years ago, and we used to play this game a lot after we all got home for the day. 

The great thing about this game is all you need is a bunch of D6 dice and some cups.

Production: Functional production, with my one quip being that I must slightly compress the cups to fit them back into the box.  I'm wishing I bought an edition that accommodated 6 players.

Play: Quick, fun play, with groans as everyone loses a die from someone calling an exact guess.  At most turns, it makes more sense to honestly guess than to predict. (2+1+2) (7 plays)

Own this as CALL MY BLUFF -- an essential game to know and play -- a true classic.

I like games with a mind games in them ("I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me").  Since there's a lot of that in this game, it follows that I should like this game.  However, I really don't like this game.  Rating of 3 means if I never play it again I'll be just fine, and since it's not a "bad" game, it doesn't get a 2.

Own the Perudo version, but play a public domain version with house rules. Despite the highly favorable comments, I find it annoying that this game often grinds down to 2 people having 1 die left...in which case it's rather random who wins.UPDATE: After years of playing, I'm raising this game by 2 full rating points due to the addition of a "spot on" rule that I found on this site (called something else though). If you think there are EXACTLY the number of numbers that the previous player called, you may call "spot on". If correct, nobody loses a die, but if YOU have lost one, you GAIN one back. Friends are playing it like it's the new craze here and with their families for Memorial Day 2007. Amazing what one little rule change can do.

Pirates of the Caribbean version with some seriously smelly dice cups and very cool dice.

This game is pretty fun with the pirate theme, especially if you're playing with kids.  They use their imagination unfettered.  "Arrr, never trust a pirate!"  They love saying it...and I think I do too...

I combined 2 of these sets, assembled a custom board (created by this guy-->ruckage), and put all of the components into a small wooden chest to create a deluxe 2-8 player version, using the traditional Liar's Dice rules.  Fun times!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I'm a fan.  Although it's an elimination game, it goes fairly quickly.  There are other ways to play Liars Dice (or some might say "Bullsh*t") but I think this version (packaged as "Bluff") is a nice mix of chance and tactics.

RATING: 8.5
With the dice you can actually see making such a tiny part of the game, I felt it was largely luck-based until towards the end, when working out probabilities became progressively more important.

It plays quickly and the calculations are simple enough that it never gets bogged down nor feels dry.

I look forward to playing again to revise my judgement.

I love how most of your wins in this game are due to skill, while chance still has a significant part to play.

Perudo version (2 sets and extra colored dice)

Fascinating game with a lot of intrigue given that it's so simple. So far I've only played with poker players, so they are accustomed to bluffing. I'm curious what it will be like with non-gamers.

Update: Got to play it recently with my extended family -- mostly a success despite my wife and one other family member thinking it was "meh." I think this can be a great gateway game despite the occasional detractor.

Update #2: Brought it to church and it was successful there as well. It's clearly a game for all kinds of groups and all occasions.

Update #3: Scales great with 4 players on up, as long as you don't mind eliminations in the larger games (had a ten player game at church, went over very well). After playing the Perudo version for so long, I was then introduced to the alternative way of playing -- with the board -- and didn't like it as much or the rule differences. I prefer the simple, ever increasing escalation of the quantities/qualities where a board isn't necessary.

A very great dice game.  It is a great bar game, and can also be played as a family or party game.  Very little room required to play the game, and no setup required.  

I would love to know if the "history" of this games dates back to the Incas like many claim.  It would add to the "mystique" of this game.

As a basic game, it is easy to acquire and play.  All you need is a dice cup and 5 dice for each player. This basic game of "Perudo" is simple and you can make your own set cheaply.

The later versions, including Richard Borg's BLuff/Liar's Dice games make it a better family game, and the board makes things easier.

In my opinion, this is the best dice game.

This is an interesting bluffing/bidding game. Unfortunately, as you lose dice, you have less information to make future bids, so it seems like it would have a runaway leader. In addition, this game has player elimination. Therefore, this is not a title that I will try to play in the future.

Since the die rolling is purely luck based, Liar's Dice boils down to a statistical puzzle. Each turn you calculate the odds of the previous bet or of your own, and make a simple decision based on the result. Its enjoyable in the right setting, but nothing I get excited over.

* Before revealing dice after a Challenge, ALL players have to vote with a thumb up or down if they're siding with the Bet or the Challenge, and all players on the losing side loses a die.

* If nobody wants to Challenge or increase the Bet, last player to Bet earns a die and the round is ended.

What an awesome game. Works equally well with gamers and non gamers. An interesting part of this game is playing with 5 or 6, it seems as if the first half of the game is sheer luck if you will get eliminated or not. After a couple players have been eliminated, the game shifts from luck-driven to more skill based. 

This is a game you should be able to easily find at a thrift store, or hell you could even make a copy. It's a game everyone should have.

[3 plays] Pleasant enough game; doesn't take long and is very adaptable to people dropping in and out of the game, so could be useful in situations where that's a plus.  Part bluffing, part luck of the dice, and part luck of seating order and how credibility-challenging the bet is when it comes around to you.  Reminds me somewhat of the card game I Doubt It.

An interesting and very fun game, known under various titles including Liars Dice, Bluff, and Perudo.

I own the Perudo edition, improved with [thread=737628]custom mat[/thread].  A combination, of luck, probability, and bluffing - not a game of mere luck, because playing the odds, a poker face, psychology, and persuasion will help you win the game!  Just need dice and rules, don't necessarily need to buy the game.  1992 SDJ winner.

Played 30+ times. Quick fun dice game. Players roll 5 dice secretly than try to guess what amounts of certain numbers they might have as a group, with each person then riasing the guess, or calling the bluff. Great game.

RATING: 10
Excellent GROUP game--any number can play (Just add more dice & another cup).  This game gets a 10, not because I enjoy more than a lot of games I have rated 7+, because I don't.  It gets a 10, because when in a group and we are looking for a filler game, it is chosen repeatedly, and rarely turned down.  The rules are quickly explained and understood, and the game moves right along.  Whether it be the first or last game in an evening, it has a solid place in our gaming group.  Social & a classic.

Own 3 sets--can play with as many people as dice & cups available.  I have played this with 15 & it is a blast.  As people get knocked out, they play Zombie Dice till the game is over.

Comment:
[Dice, Probabilities, Bluff, Filler] {6P:10, 5P:9} {Ravensburger Edition: Bluff by Richard Borg} Raucous filler for a lot of players. Sometimes, winning depends on where you end up sitting. If you have a lot of aggressive bidders before you in the turn order, you're in pretty good shape. Completely random, but you're playing with a bunch of dice so what do you expect? As always, a basic grasp of probability helps a bit. It's the party aspect of the game that keeps it enjoyable, and a good deal better than other pure dice games that try to be a little more serious (like Can't Stop). Yell "Bullshit" as loud as crisply as you can when challenging a bid! :-) ***UPDATE: After I acquired a copy of Bluff, we've played it almost every time we meet up. It's unquestionably one of the best fillers / light games available. The rating is for the Ravensburger Bluff edition, which is top-notch in terms of components, even if the box contains mostly air (love the black box though). Every home should have a copy of Bluff.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Awesome filler. 

This game is commonly played in Chinese bars as a drinking game and that's how I was introduced to it - except that I don't drink. 

The version I played later and have been looking to buy since is "Bluff" and the dice/player elimination + stars(wild/joker dice) makes for a much more interesting game. Love it!

Every time that I play this game, I am amazed at how many agonizing decisions are packed into such a short time. And I don't mean agonizing in the painful way, I mean agonizing in the beautiful way. Your only pieces of information for each decision are simple odds and the bets of the previous players. This game is phenomenal if you're involved to the end, but the nature of the game dictates that people will drop off one by one. If you get out early in a big game, it can be boring, but that's just all the more incentive to try again. And the best part is, all you need to play is a bunch of dice. A set of small dice (which are easier to hide from other players) usually come in a set of 36 for about $8 and they fit in your pocket.

The rules we use (I believe) are actually closer to those of Perudo, but we all still call it Liar's Dice: 1) Betting order is [1 of anything, 2 of anything, 1 ace/wild, 3 of anything, 4 of anything, 2 ace/wild, 5 of anything]; 2) you only lose one dice when you get caught making a bid too large; 3) exact guesses are rewarded with an extra dice taken from the bidder; 4) we start with 5 dice each.

I say "believe" because I've never purchased Liar's Dice or Puerdo, or any similar "dice game" in a box.

This game is great.

Homemade.  The ruleset we've settled on:
1) if you raise the quantity, the value called can drop (ie raising three 6's by going to four 2's is valid)
2) the Great Re-Roll Rule for Professionals has increased our enjoyment significantly
3) 1's are wild
4) after many plays, we finally outlawed bidding 1's.  Raising 4 6's by bidding 2 1's is such a cop-out.

I could play this all day long.  Best with 3 or 2 players.

Not so much of a surprise here. I was really looking forward to trying this one out, but I was really underwhelmed. Less of a game and more of a "catch your opponent in a bluff" deal. Not really much different than 'Bullshit' the card game. Perhaps Richard Borg's version is different enough that I might enjoy this game, but as for the classic 'Perudo' I just didn't really care for it at all. Might keep all the dice and cups though for other things!

I downloaded the game board and rules here on the geek and bought a bunch of dice to bring on a group vacation and it turned out to be the game we played the most! UPDATE:  This has become my default "gateway party game" of choice.  When I grab a few games to take along to any occasion, my cups and dice are almost always among them.  So, I've bumped the rating to a "10".  It is simple and fun.

What a delightfully fun dice game! It's an instant request at any Game night I host.

The Front Porch Classics latest version is exceedingly nice.  A wooden box shaped like a die houses four ceramic cups and the bag of dice.

I have cups and dice, not an official copy of the game.  I'm not sure if the rules include this, but I also play with 1's as wilds and therefore when calling 1's the value is doubled (ie. three 1's is the equivalent of six 2's).  Also, I play with contributes.  If you want to prove that there is a high likelihood that your call is correct, you can reveal all your dice, push forward the dice relevant to your call (ie. you call ten 4's, and you have two 4's and one 1 that you push forward) then re-roll your remaining dice.

I wonder how did this game get the 'Spiel des Jahres' award? Probably because of lack of other good games it could compete with. It's not bad - just average. Some dice rolling, some bluffing, some guessing. A fine party game - that's all.

One of my gaming friends can't get enough of this game so it gets brought out more than it really should. It is essentially the dice game being played in 'Pirates of the Caribbean'.

There is simple mechanics behind this game, throw your dice look at your numbers and guess how many there are of the dices. There is a great deal of push your luck element, but in opposite to e.g. [GAMEID=15512] you base much of your choices of what other players have chosen before and therefore much larger bluff element. This makes the game really hair-raising. You could of course (and you should) also have a mathematical approach to the game and count if it is realistic. I know some will try to count the odds, even though rely more on gut feeling.

I think it plays better with more players, because there are more dice around to count on and it becomes more of a push your luck game. Don’t worry, even if there is player elimination it plays quickly.

It can be brilliant, but I think it comes into its own if you play with the same crowd repeatedly. There's not really much in the game itself to go on when you're trying to determine if a player is telling the truth or bluffing. But tendencies and inclinations start to reveal themselves when you play with the same people over and over. And it's these "tells" that make the game enjoyable.

Perudo is just another name for "Liar's Dice," a game where you all have your own separate dice concealed with only you knowing what you have, while you try to guess or "bet" on how many of any particular dice number (1-6) there are between everyone with the stakes increasing with each bet.  If you want to play a lighter game, this is a great one to play!

Anyway, now I have the cups and coloured dice on my shelf so I will keep playing it. It's fun.

I "own" this in the sense that I have dice and cups.  Great game with the right people.  It's best to play this to a certain number of points where each dice you end the game with is worth 1 point.

Best with 2-4 players. Lots of fun. I find it brings out people's personalities. What is really neat is that you can actually figure out some people's "tells" -- the accidental signs they drop that they are bluffing. It's quite cool to see your friends try to bullshit you! Calling bluffs is exciting.

The version I own is pirate themed -- made it myself using BGG files. Printed the bidding board for 8 players and mounted the image on about 1.2mm cardboard. I put a 4 player bidding board on the reverse side of one of the board sections. Sprayed with matte finishing coat to get rid of the light reflection. Bought matching dice and made my own carboard box. Very pleased.

This is one of those games that we break out to start or end an evening of gaming, but unlike other games in my collection that serve that same purpose, people would be happy to keep playing it several times, putting off the "Main Event" or extending a session into the wee hours of the morning.  It's fun, fast, and easy to teach.  Being able to bluff, read other people's bluffs, and calculate the odds of a bid are key skills needed for this game.  I don't have many bluffing games, so this one fits a good niche in my collection.

The game is entertaining, it is more of a party game. The luck is so out of control, you are just guessing what your enemies might have. While you are calculating chances of each number, you can make your way a bit better, but to tell the truth Carcassonne, Love Letter and Ticket To Ride is doing the job in a much more elegant and better way. I play this if im asked to, but i will never ask for it.

Great game, noisy, and a lot of fun!  This can be played as a filler, waiting for others or at the end of an evening.  

I do have some complaints however:  My version only has enough dice for 4 players, and other versions I have played have 6.  I feel cheated!  Also, it is a player elimination game which can frustrate some.

Like most older games that are still playable this one shines with a certain purity.  As soon as I think of it, I wish I were playing it.  And the best part is that any respectable gamer with enough table-cred should be able to cobble together a workable set from common household items (like [i]Episode II[/i] Slurpee cups and scads of dice).  Recommended.

[b]Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' Edition (2006) — 10 YEARS LATER[/b]

Holy shit whatever nuclear chemical they used to make these things has gone rancid in the most awful way possible—the box stinks, the rules stink, the dice stink and the cups exude a palpable miasma that makes mucous membranes weep blood.  Seriously considering using tongs and a Level 5 containment suit to throw this in the trash.

Also, I'm pretty sure the Chinese workers who made this are all dead.

An entertaining game with a very good bluffing element.  Plays much better than you could expect from reading the rules.  Contrary to some suggestions found here on BGGG, I recommend playing the less-forgiving variant, in which you loose the dice equal to the difference between your call and the actual amount.

I've played this several times before February 19th, 2008. This is luck weighted, however has some strategy in this bluff game. All players are given 5 dice. Simultaneously everyone rolls the dice and hides them. After everyone checks their dice, players state 1) a die value/number & 2) quanity of that die value that are in all player possession. Subsequent player must 1) increase the quanity of dice, 2) increase the value/number of the "die" (if current is four-3's; they can go four-4's), or 3) call a bluff of the previous player. Players may also may increase both # of dice and dice number. If a bluff is called, all players reveal their dice and determine who loses a die. If there are at least the number of dice called, then the challenger loses one of their dice. If there aren't enough dice from stated, then the declarer loses a dice. Also 1's are wild and always count as the current # called. Wild bidding is in order of: 1 anything(*), 1W, 2*, 3*, 2W, 4*, 5*, 3W, etc. Once you lose all of your dice you are out. Last one with dice left wins!  I'd strongly recommend playing this game. It's a great filler & party game. You may be able to scrounge up enough dice to play without purchase. First playe Perudo on 2/20/08.

Liar's Dice, Perudo, whatever you call it.

A classic dice and bluffing game. It is good for family enjoyment. I would like to indicate a few weak points. The game aspect of Liar's Dice is mainly determinded by dice luck. Futhermore, losers lose their dice each time. For this reason, the game is far more unfavorable to underdogs. Then, if someone lose all the dice earlier than others, the player have to wait for a while. Sometimes, the losers wait more than 10 minuet just nothing to do. Therefore, I've sold this game away.

Ok filler game. For some reason, it kind of annoyed me. I don't know why. I think the whole lying/discusion part of it is what I hated the most. I don't mind bluffing when bidding the number of dice. That's part of the game obviously, but the other discusion among the other players bothered me. So maybe it's more about the people I played with than the game itself, but it still left a bad taste in my mouth.

A very nice version of Liar's Dice. Six plastic tumblers with 6 sets of different coloured dice in a beautiful storage tin. A classic bluffing game which works best with 4 or more.

RATING: 5
It's cool in a way. It's like taking poker and making the probabilities easier to calculate through tying everything to dice-roll results and using just combinations of the same results. But the reduction in complexity allows for higher-level play for beginner's but makes it less of an interesting game. Also, this is a game that draaaaaaaaaaags. It just doesn't want to die. The only time I played it, it was with 6 people and it lasted almost an hour. There are games that half as long and are way more fun. Not interested in playing it again.

Excellent Filler, could become my fav filler game with more play and some tweaking as it is a 15 minute game of fun that everyone will enjoy. 

Lots of different variants for this game but the basic idea is the same, be sure to play that you can display dice outside your cup and re-roll what is inside before raising as it adds to the game, also you only lose ONE die not the difference when challenged which reduces the luck.  Feels like a mix of poker with bridge-like incremental bidding. The bluff/push-your-luck element makes it fun and keeps it interesting. There is luck here but not as much as you might think, about the same as Poker as smart players will watch others and play the odds accordingly while bluffing carefully. 

Can be played 2 to 8 (just add dice), best with 5 to 6 though. Lower than 5 not as fun and more than 6 too luck heavy. 

[u]UPDATE:[/u]After many more plays this really shines as a filler and makes a great gateway game too. The game is a lot of fun even to watch and everyone likes it. I think it is my favourite filler game.

Quick, fun game of bluff (and luck!). I prefer "Bluff" with its board which helps  no-end remembering the current bid (essential after a few beers!) and the dice have the nice stars instead of 6's.  

We also play "only lose 1 dice" for younger players making an incorrect call and we occasionally use the re-roll variant for us older dudes to stop the whining about "poor rolls" (I don't think such things exist in this game)!

Love the social aspect of this one and the simplicity of the rules. Can be played almost anywhere and with anyone, this is a classic. Player elimination can be a bit of an issue, particularly if someone goes out early or if you have a high player count.

Initial Rating 6.5 (September 2010)

I really like this noisy dice game. It has luck in it but you can work out the odds and turn them to your advantage (bluffing and/or pushing your luck) , so it doesn’t bother me. I feel the best player will win this more often than not. Also the game can be explained under 2 minutes and played under 30 minutes. A great gateway game with surprising depth. I think you need at least 4 players to properly enjoy it, less than that and the game is not as fun.

I want to play again and I will try it with my family.

Nowadays, my desire to play Liar's Dice is rather low. I’m not sure why but I almost always resist a game of it :/. I should like more the game but I don’t. Due to this I’m downgrading its rating. I already sold my copy of the game.

SdJ 1993. Funny bluffing dice game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Strengths:Incredibly easy to teach.Basic strategy is clear after a couple of games. This makes it easy for new players to catch on and feel like they're really playing the game.Quite a bit of skill (bluffing, discernment, remembering bids, estimating probability, etc.)Weaknesses:One-on-One can degenerate quickly if the players enter it unbalanced (one has 4 dice and the other has 1 or 2) and isn't as fun as the group game.Outcome is partially determined by seating order. If the game is mixed between experienced and new players, it's possible for the experienced players to take advantage of the new players and use them against other experienced players. This doesn't create the best feelings at the table.

RATING: 6
a GREAT filler and a lot of fun when in the mood for it.

A very good gambling game should you go for it, but it's a lot of bluff and bluster (plus odds playing).

Not something you can play forever, but a great game!

What a terrible excuse for a game. How about I think of a number, 1-50, and you wager against other people what I picked. Also, this is going to take, like, 20 minutes.

RATING: 4
I really don't enjoy this game. yes it's a bluffing game but it is also an elimination game. Players get eliminated by slowing losing their dice by being called out and proven a liar or by calling someone else a liar and finding out he/she isn't. The game usually comes down to two people with one player having an advantage in dice and typically the player with more dice going into that battle wins.

RATING: 9
Excellent game of bluffing and deduction.  Fool your opponents with outrageous lies, and get them in big trouble when they build on your ridiculous bids.  Figure out your opponent's hands from their overly conservative bids, and stick them with the best possible bid.  What a joy it is to play this game - it feels like a party game, but is every bit as skillful as a euro game (well, a light one anyway).  Your poker skills will come in handy.

Another filler that gets a lot of rotation because of its easy to explain rules and level playing field. Experience will buy you a leg up, but not much. Although it's a knockout game it's short, so its not a big deal when you can play a couple in a row.

I'm surprised to say that Liar's Dice ranks up there with For Sale, No Thanks!, and Category 5 as far as 15 minute games go. It's a game of frantically rolling dice, punting off of the secret results, playing the probabilities, and piling the pressure on your opponents as they lose dice. Quite fun and engaging.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a fun filler, but really can be quite unpredictable. Everyone rolls dice and then players bet on the amount of a particular value of dice that everyone has. The previous player can be challenged and then the dice are counted. If the challenge is lost that player loses a die. If they beat the prediction the challenger loses one. If it is a tie all the other players than the predictor lose one. The tough part is guessing whether the player is giving a real prediction or a bluff to make you bid high. This just needs to be played for laughs.

I really dig this game. It's main "problem" is that all the dice makes people think that it is a random type party game, whereas it's really a challenging game. Played with a doctor, a 10 year old and an 18 year old yesterday, and the kids were knocked out first, with my mental might barely besting the doctor. 

The end game is a beautiful dance of tension and deception.

We were given the Pirates of the Caribbean version by some good friends (so they obviously think it's good too), and are enjoying playing a slight variant to the rules in the box. Of course you don't need the nice ancient-looking cups and dice, but it sure adds to the overall experience.

A very nice game, what more can be said.  The recent exposure in the Pirates of the Caribbean movie helps people relate, but a simple dice game is approachable by everyone.  I look forward to enjoying this as a nice filler for a long time to come.

Update 6/10: I've finally broken the mental barrier of not having 10's.  So if I'm actually using the upper end of the scale, I need to rate Liar's Dice as a 10.  I love the game, would play it whenever, and should definitely become a family favorite.  When all our kids are old enough we'll have 6 players!

Fun bluffing game if it wasn't for the rule that everybody loses a die when one player challenged and the bid amount was exactly right. I hate that. How is it my fault if somebody else makes bad calls? Of course you could house rule this but then again I don't bother with house rules. I've got too many games which I enjoy just the way they are.

RATING: 7
Very simple game of inference and dissimulation. Can be played as quickly as you like and needs only a few dice per player.

I have now tried the variants with variable dice loss and/or wild sixes, they all work. The former adds a little more nerve but also feels a little more random.

RATING: N/A
Known as 'Pirate's Dice' - Two sets
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
All players keep their dice secret. Then each player in turn must state how many of a particular number has been rolled. Eventually, the number gets challenged and the loser of the challenge loses a dice.

The Good: Good party game of push your luck. Plays fast. It inexpensive new, and better yet, it quite often shows up dirt cheap in thrift stores. I own 2 different versions of Perudo and a version of Liar's dice. Between the sets there are quite a few variants included.

The Bad: The raising the bid rule is difficult for some light gamers to grasp. To make matters worse, Perudo does NOT explain it well. Liars dice takes a different tack and lays out the possible bids on a board - this is easier to explain, but means you have to lug the board around for a dice game.

賞はとっているけど、好みではない。負け抜けのゲームで、酷いことに一旦負け始めると加速度的に負けて行く。抜けた人は見ていても面白くない。ポーカーとブラフの二択ならば、ポーカーの方が役づくりができる分、より面白いと思う。シンプルすぎて味がない感じ。

This is probably my all time favorite filler.  I’m always willing to play this, at any player count.  With more than six, reduce the amount of starting dice so it doesn’t take too long.

A simple and fun bluffing game. This is a great game as a side activity for parties or social occasions. It’s very interactive and gets competitive but it’s very easy to pick up and play and it’s very ‘comfortable’ for non-gamers (being a dice game with very simple rules).

This game does have a strong luck element, but don’t be deceived, there is more skill here than it might first appear. Being able to bluff and read bluffs is extremely helpful but there is also some strategy in what calls to make (one example, picking a call that is conservative enough that it’s not likely to get you called out but large enough that it shouldn’t make it all the way around the table and back to you).

I love games where the rules operate like a Dad teaching his child to ride a bike. They exist to provide a framework and certainty before getting out of the way and allowing the player's skill/creativity to shine.

This is a perfect example of such a game. Very few rules, it is all about how you bluff and how good your fib detector is.

Public domain game.. 

Liar's Dice is a dice game where each player is given five dice and cup to roll and hide them with. Players make successively higher declarations regarding the results of all the dice remaining in the game, e.g. "there are ten sixes". However, someone can always contest the bid. When that happens, all the dice are revealed and either the bidder or the caller loses dice, depending on who was correct. The last player with dice is the winner.

We have the Perudo version of this game. For some reason we have friends/family that are into dice games (golf, three's, etc). So this one usually gets brought out at holidays and big parties, late at night after a long day. Don't have to think much to play, easy to pick up and fun enough to play a round or two several times a year.

I think the origins of Liars Dice/Perudo was from South America.  It's best "approached" as a fun party bluffing game.  Bluffing is the best part of this.  There is a "push your luck" element, combined with bluffing, determining probabilities, and choosing when you have to decide whether to "challenge" a bid or bid "higher" (or force someone into that situation).  I love doing the "no-look bid" when I make a bid without looking at my dice...  What a hoot!...  :D    If you like this, you may also like Pow Wow aka Coyote.

This is a great party/bluffing game that anyone can pick up.  Since you have to pay attention as the bid goes around the room, there feels like very little downtime.

If you're tired of poker, try this classic gambling game. Depth of play goes as deep as your players' personalities. Basic odds calculation, the ability to extrapolate from limited information, and a good poker face are required here, just like poker. A production copy of the game is not necessary; five dice and an opaque cup per player make this a straightforward, if not exactly cheap, game to DIY.

RATING: 9
Easily my favourite pure dice game, and one of my top two or three fillers. Liar’s Dice features a quick pace, a nice rhythm, good tension and a few cool tactical options. I’m a fan of the one-roll-then-a-couple-of-turns structure, which is the inverse of many dice games. Also, the bidding is an almost unique way of letting players react to the randomness of the dice (although it is, of course, familiar from poker and the like).

It’s easy to underestimate how much the star/wild face adds to the game, too. It adds some real bidding choices between going with a conventional bid or a nearby stars-only bid, and it also changes the probabilities on the normal bids in useful ways.

Liar’s Dice is probably at its best with 5 players, and also very good with 4. 6 is very chaotic, and it is possible to go from a full allotment of dice to wiped out with one bad or unlucky bid. 2-player is better than you might expect, featuring a sort of knife fight quality, but 3-player is too staid for my taste.

Note that some versions of the game let players reveal some of their dice and then re-roll the rest. This seems lie it should be a good thing, reducing the importance of luck, but it screws with the pace a rhythm in ways I find rather distasteful, and also detracting from the purity of the game as well.

It’s not necessary for most gamers to go out and buy a copy to play Liar’s Dice, by the way. All you need are 5 6-siders per player and a cup or a shield for each. There are several mats for bid-tracking available in the Geek’s files section.

Minor trivia points: a variant of Liar’s Dice is used as the conflict resolution mechanic for the RPG Dirty Secrets; it’s also the game the pirates play in the second Pirates of the Caribbean movie. The movie-branded version of the game uses a rather dull version of the rules, though.

Made myself a copy of Liar's Dice after seeing Perudo going for 20 bucks (with no board!).

Like poker, it's not about what you have, it's what others believe that you have.  Unfortunately, I'm not a very good liar, but that doesn't stop me from enjoying bluffing as a mechanic immensely.  I would recommend Liar's Dice to any game group comfortable enough with each other to be able to look each other in the eyes and declare "bullshit" with as much malice and venom as possible.

Pleasing little game of odds and bluff.  Good fun, though if we are being honest there is a lot more luck than judgment, and the one who manages to hold the most dice going into the end-game has a huge advantage.

RATING: 6
Players get five dice and make bids that there are more dice rolled in game.  Each bid must be higher and 1's count as wild of any number but you can bid on 1's and there are locations where this allows you to outbid other players.  Ultimately, another player will challenge another player and if the bidding player bid a number less than or equal to the number, the challenging player loses a dice.  If the number of dice is less than the number bid, the bidding player loses one of their dice.  You play until all players but one has a dice.  There are all kinds of alternate rules such if you guess the number exactly, all other players lose a dice.  

This is a game you can make yourself, by printing on the Geek and buying different colored dice.  

Very fun and light filler.  It can run long with more than 4 players.

This game can easily be made with 6 cups and 30 dice.
Liar's Dice includes a red die (for reasons unknown as of this comment) and a game board (which can likely facilitate play on days when a writing device is unavailable). 
NB: Perudo has the 6 cups in different colors (with dice to match)... more attractive, but same idea. THIS IS REALLY NICE LOOKING

BTW This game can easily be played with Yahtze Free For All (considering all the dice it comes with).

RATING: 8.5
One of the best filler-type games. (Can be) fairly short, fun to play, and lots of player interactivity. Also, with multiple sets you can have a lot of players, although this does increase the complication. Great for large parties. However, once players are out, they can be waiting for a bit before the game's over, although it's still fun to watch.

Homemade set.  We play the "Perudo" rules.

This is one of the "go to" games for my family.  We play with 3-6, and it shines with any of those number of players.  This is one of my father's specialties - he has nights when no one can defeat him!

Lots of fun.  Light and Lucky, but enough bluffing and guess work to be fun.   Gets some good laughs out of a group of friends or family.

I generally don't like games where players are eliminated, but with the length of time a round lasts, they're only waiting a couple minutes before they can jump into the next game... and yes, this is one where you want to play again.

The rules are just a bit tricky to grasp at first: such as the concept of bidding half way down to aces, and then double it again (AND add one) for the next bid, or how the round goes after someone gets to their last one ("Palifico")... but after a few games you can remember them.

If you're going to purchase, look for the "Perudo" version.  You get enough to play with 6, and often for a cheaper price than "Pirates Dice", "Liars Dice", or "Dudo"

A fun game of deduction and bluffing.  I own the "Perudo" version but I have played both the "Perudo" rules and with various rules not in that version. One "Perudo" rule - "Palafico" seemed overally complex and we did not use it.  Due to the fact that there is no set way to play this game - it misses classic status for me and is just a very good bluffing game and a great filler.

RATING: 8
I picked this up hoping for a light, quick family game with a bit of depth, and got exactly that. There are layers here, including bluffing and probability calculation, that emerge during play. And the core game is just plain fun, full of close calls, tactical decisions, following hunches, and laughing at bad calls.

The rules are a little fuzzy in places, and the palifico rule in particular seems needlessly fiddly for what's basically a family game, but at the end of the day it's no big deal.

Just about the only thing I really dislike is the player elimination. In a game that can run close to 30 minutes, getting knocked out early isn't much fun; it's not that fun to watch.

Bluff game. I think it is similar to poker, with the dice as random number generators instead of the cards.
Also, the bets are not raised by money but by "boldness" of the bet itself. I like it altough it has a "rich get richer" effect. If you lose one or two dice at the beginning by bad luck you will have an hard time coming back in the game.

My favorite game so far. Wonderful combination of simple mechanics, probability theory, bluffing, intuition and psychology. 
Perudo version of the game has the best rules (you can download them here: http://tinyurl.com/perudo-rules). Clearly, there is lots of luck as well but better players definitely seem to win more often.

I really enjoy bluffing, but somehow I dont enjoy this bluffing game as much as other bluffing games. Maybe because it is most of the times just not tense till the end because someone has a big dice advantage or I dont like the game because of the player  elemination. Or maybe because of the more "necessity" driven bluffing instead of "ripping off" driven bluffing like in "You are bluffing" or "Felix".

Personal favorite dice and bluffing game.  I prefer to play it somewhat causally since it can get a little chaotic with particular people.  The end is a little anti-climatic and much more luck based than I would have preferred, but it works to keep it suspenseful.  My biggest problem with this game is that people who are eliminated have to sit around and wait for the end.  I have played this game with 3 to 6 people and enjoyed it every time.

The only reason I wouldn't happily call this a perfect filler game is because someone could end up losing quite early on and have nothing to do for the rest of the game (and personally I don't find it very interesting to watch once I have lost).

Gifted the boxed edition by my 'extended family', The Pickerings, Christmas of 2013.  Thank you!


This game comes with enough components for a maximum of six players.

You can add more players if your group contains more gamers than that though!  Simply trackdown some more cups and dice!  Easy.

However, you should be aware that this will make the first half-dozen or so rounds longer, as there are many more dice within the game now increasing the potential variety of outcomes, and will extend overall game length considerably.  No mind though, this game rocks.  Longer game time, more merriment!

RATING: 8
Liar's Dice is a very quick playing game that's dead simple to learn and the simple elegance of the rules belies the depth of the mind games and bluffing that happens during game play. Highly recommended as a quick filler and for those that might like a game like Poker in theory but for whom the gambling element is a turn off.

One of the first board games I played that was not my own, other than Monopoly. Loved it then, that I kept an eye out for a copy, and found one second hand that I travelled out just to get.

The game is great quality for how old it is, and is definitely going to last. Snatched it up, and the best way to introduce people to it is ask if they watch the Pirates of the Carribean movie, and people will be able to relate straight away.

I genuinely do not get this game.  I first got it 20 years ago.  I have tried introducing it to four very different gaming groups about four to five years apart now.  The result has always been the same in that they have asked if we really needed to finish playing the game (they disliked it that much).  So, I'm beginning to wonder if this games "popularity" is some sort of joke perpetrated by the eurogaming crowd on the rest of the boardgaming community.  I truely don't get it.

Liar's Dice is a fun, quick game that actually requires a lot more thinking than you might expect at first.  I enjoy it because even though it's a light, party style game, better players will consistently come out on top.  It combines a good amount of bluffing, pushing your luck, and strategy into an enjoyable cocktail.

The game does have a lot of versions, so it does sometimes happen that you'll play with people who play differently from you.  It also isn't a quiet game, and some people just can't seem to grasp the strategy.  Still, it's a pretty good filler and I enjoy bringing it out occasionally.  As a bonus, you can pretty much make a copy of the game without purchasing anything.

I have the perudo version, and EXTREMELY mixed feelings. On the one hand, this is a game that people love. I can show it to any group, and they'll want to play it again and again. 

On the other hand, for some reason I don't feel as drawn into it as everyone else is - I must be immune to it's addictive qualities. I often wish that people would get tired of it faster so we could perhaps play something else for once. Not a bad game, an interesting premise, but not nearly as replayable, to me, as it is to everyone else.

I love it, very basic strategies and plenty of luck involved but the player interaction is great fun.

After playing tournament variants, the game is even better. The number you were off by is how many dice you lose when challenged. If you were exactly correct you steal a die. You can place any number of die with the same number in front of you and re-roll the rest, then make a bid.

Good moneyless gambling type game, though I think it gets a lot less interesting when there are only two players left.

There are a few differences between Liar's Dice and Perudo, though they share the same BGG entry.  I prefer Perudo because it's possible to reclaim lost dice, and you never lose more than one at a time.

Easily one of my favorite filler games, this turns every round into an event. The game does feature player elimination, yet it's one of the few games where most players will stick around to see who wins, simply because the end game show down between two players is often so entertaining to watch. There's some light math to be done in determining probabilities here, but this is certainly a game of bluffing above all else. Timeless.

RATING: 7
Pretty much amazing, for a game that is essentially free (about 30 dice, depending on how many players you want to support, and six coffee cups). A lot of luck gets thrown into play with more players, but once those players begin to dwindle, more skill is involved. However, the most skilled player can get easily eliminated early on when there are still many players, due to the high factor of luck involved in that stage of the game. This makes it a fun party game, where experienced players will win often, but new players can still win from time to time.

This game is such a simple idea, that I was shocked to see it listed as having been made in the 80's. Given the components, this game could have been played in ancient Egypt.

The first time I played Liar's Dice it was called 'Mexican Bullshit', (probably would have been difficult to market with that title), and we played it with components from other games.

RATING: 6
A fun quick bluffing game.  Everyone rolls there set of dice.  First player announces, 'there are 5 5's rolled our of all of our dice'.  Next player either wants to 'call his bluff' and count all the dice, OR up the ante by the amount of 5's, or increase it to 5 6's.

As the game goes on people lose their dice and get eliminated by guessing wrong, or calling someone on their bluff wrongly.

A great game for any number, 11+ no problem... who can not like this game? Probably not anyone I'd like to game with.
I guess the elimination factor can be a problem, it can take a long time, and near the end there tends to arise many damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't situations. But it's so much fun: the dread as the numbers build up toward you, the delight in unerringly calling a bluff, the glee when the group bands together to take down an opponent who hasn't lost any dice.

docking some points -- it can get to be kind of the same game over and over.

A good tense game for just simple rolling.  So many different rules depending if you play Perudo, Dudo, or Liar's Dice.  The 7 rating reflects Perudo.  I would lower Liar's Dice to a 5 or 6.  I just like the Perudo version better (which I now own).

(I own a Scandinavian/Finnish edition : "Bluff", which has one of the ugliest covers ever)
A very good filler bluffing/betting dice game. Games are quick but exciting. Only real minus is the player elimination element but games are quite short so it doesn't matter really. With experienced players you might want to try "show some dice, bid higher & reroll" -variant. 

Update (27.3.2007): This is one true abstract I like very much. Fixed rating from 8 to 9 after a few more games.

I could easily buy a bunch of d6s and some cups. Why would I pay for a commercial version of this game?

Update: I wouldn't. I traded for this in a math trade. Whee, dice.

Rules played:
Ones are wild unless the first call is "n ones".
3 options on your turn: raise the bid, call BS on the previous call, call "exact" on the previous call.
If you call "exact" and lose, you lose a die; should this be 2 dice?
If you call "exact" and win, you gain a die.

Own Call My Bluff edition

RATING: 10
200+ plays. This gets better as the group you play it with gets better and it becomes mostly about the smacktalk. A perfect opener for us. Working out the odds on what the likelihood of a particular call being true or not is just a starting point. What people are betting on really is which number has deviated significantly from average this turn and how far, so if you keep gambling on the average being the right number, you'll be off. The question each turn is, can I make a claim that will be believed and raised and get me off the hook based on what's gone round, regardless of the odds. Funnily enough, and knowing this, if someone's passed me something outrageous, it's probably more likely to be true. Doesn't mean I'll take it, because calling may be low risk, but it could be low risk to escalate as well! Then there's the whole ducking out and betting on stars to minimise dice loss whilst the crowd hoots and hollers and derides your manhood. But it keeps you in the game at least. We occasionally play a variant that if you claim stars, and you're called and you lose, it's instant death, which can be fun. Anyway, 10 years on and the game still gets requested more nights than not.

For me, this might prove to be the perfect filler game.  Sometimes-I think the MB version is the best-comes ready for 6 players, and the board makes it real easy to explain and track bidding.

This classic game involves all players secretly rolling dice, and then the players in turn try to guess how many of certain numbers were rolled.  On your turn, you can either try to refute the prior claim, or make a claim that's less likely to be true.  I really dislike bluffing games, as I'm a terrible liar, but this one bothers me even more because if you think the previous claim is exactly accurate, you're screwed.

This was fun. Quick and heavily luck-involved. Actually the idea is to kind of "push your luck".
It can put you in really unpleasant situations sometimes when you have to choose between rising the bet and calling a bluff...
You'll sometimes lose your dice quite fast, so don't get too keen on guessing the number of correct dice. Oh yeah, and sixes are wild.

I've got the Pirates of the Caribbean version because it was the cheapest I could find. I thought I'd be bothered by the commercial theme, but instead it actually feels like a generic Pirate theme which actually adds to the game for many of the people I've introduced it too. It's an excellent bluff game and a must-play for September 19th! (International Talk Like a Pirate Day)

This is a noisy and fun social game.  It scales well up to about 8 people.  It's relatively quick to play.  There are interesting decisions to make.  New players always, always, always want to play a second or third game.  Short enough to be a quick filler at a game night, fun enough to be played several times in a row at any social gathering.  My only complaint is that it's sometimes hard to explain what a "higher bid" means.

When I got back into games in '96-'97, my attention was drawn to this dice game by Sumo, Game Cabinet etc, all declaring it a classic. I've introduced it to family and friends with 50% liking it, the rest indifferent. I've recently been playing with gamer friends, where Bluff is often requested. So the problem with the game is that it is a probability exercise that some casual players can't (or don't like to) work out the odds; and yet if you don't do the maths you don't get the fun of the pressure of a bid or the surprising odds of rolling six "1's" out of seven dice. The bidding tends to be the same from game to game, especially if using the re-roll rule, which elevates the drama. The elimination is another niggle, but with the house rule of not losing your only die to exact bids helps players stay in longer. Probably the ultimate abstract dice game (i.e. simultaneous rolling, players interested in what others may have been rolled), appreciated by those who enjoy calculating the chances. Rating reflects playing with such personalities, though it can't go any higher due to the elimination factor.

RATING: 7
This is good as far as fillers go. It is essentially a game of making educated guesses with some poker-style bluffing when it gets down to only two or three players. Player elimination is a knock against it but it's short enough that it's only a minor niggle. Played with re-roll variant.

Excellent game. I actually carry a plastic bag, with 25 small dice, to parties and often suggest the game to "break the ice". The best of the bluffing games and one that requires a bit of thought. Note: The original game is from Peru and it is said that the last king of the Inca Empire played the game with his captors. The Borg game is a variant of the original. Others who have been credited with 'inventing' the game include Cosmo Fry and Alfredo Fernandini.

I remember watching Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest and thinking that the dice game they played looked cool. I was 15 at the time, and after returning from the movie, later that night I found the Wikipedia page for Liar's dice and learned how to play the game.

Over the next week or so, I played tons of Liar's Dice with my brother. We played and played and played. It's a testament to the game that we were able to play a hundred rounds or so before getting bored, but eventually we figured out the basic strategy of things and every game started to feel less flashy. It also made me realize that the round they showed in the movie was basically the most exciting round of Liar's Dice ever (props to the writers, but boo to me for getting overexcited about it).

I have to mention the best round I ever played. I was playing against my dad, and we had both figured out that the first few bids are meaningless. I had been setting up bluffs by calling early numbers he didn't have, but he caught on, so they had lost all their value. Then he started calling numbers he didn't have to prevent me from gaining information. One time, he decided to open the bidding with one 2. I looked at my dice and didn't have any. I felt there was a chance he didn't either. I called him. He couldn't believe it. He didn't have any either. Classic. I just wish that there was more than one great story like that in the 250+ rounds I played.

I've enjoyed Liar's Dice for years. Don't get to play too often and I don't technically own a real set, but that's part of the greatness of Liar's Dice--just a few dice and any old cups and you can be playing. 

There's not a ton of strategy in Liar's Dice, but there is a bit. Knowing your probabilities, trying to read opponents, and using your information to help make decisions will help you do better. But the thing Liar's Dice is great at is creating drama and tension. Players are forced into very tough bids and calls with huge whoops of pleasure when they're right. I've rarely seen people not having fun when playing and getting involved, and for that I'm almost always up for playing a few rounds here and there.

I have never played an "official" version of this with a board, but it's an interesting filler. You definately need to bring your poker face with you.

I have now played the "official" version. I am not fond of it. I don't like the wilds, I think there is too much of a chance for someone to get taken out of the game way too fast. I prefer just losing one die each time you're wrong. However, I do like the board as a way to see where the bid is.

I'd enjoy this game even more if there was some way to not get burned on exact bids!  They get me ALL the time. :) With more plays I'm starting to get a feel for the subtleties of the bluff aspect here - it is the name of the game after all.

More known at home as Perudo, that game is very easy to learn and is quite a lot of fun as a filler game. We usually play it at the end of the night, when we are just finished playing a bigger game. It is too late to start a new board game but, the guests still would like to play a little something. That's when Perudo gets out of its bag. It's a bluff game... What is there more to say, bluffing is always fun!!

Clássico que sempre quis ter e aprender, tendo comprado uma edição de colecção, bem janota, em madeira e com características decorativas, e também por isso ter criado ainda maiores expectativas. Pois bem, bluff fora do controlo, num estilo caótico, que mais parece um jogo de palpites, como o Totobola... Tendo em conta que tem quase tantos anos quanto eu, e que um jogo centrado nos dados não me costuma agradar muito, consigo tolerar e voltar a jogá-lo... Quando for velhinho!

Hate that players can land in no-win situations.

ex: The previous player says five sixes are on the table. The current player suspects that there are not six sixes on the table, and that the following player will certainly challenge if he claims there are. However, he also knows there's a good chance there ARE five sixes on the table, and that he'll lose if he challenges the previous player. 

He's stuck in a situation he can't win, through no fault of his own.

I have some kind of version of this called Bluff. I basically got it just because I played it once with my brother and won. Some kind of split-second psychosis occured when I later saw it in a store. I've had it for years and years now, have hardly ever played it and really can't see myself ever playing it again.

Edit. Sold for the equivalent of like 5 or 6 bucks. Later I saw the guy I sold it to trying to sell it :)

Update on 11-30-2017:

This game is the gift that keeps on giving. If my ratings are truly tied to the amount of fun I have while playing my games, then this deserves to be higher. Upped the rating from 8 to 9.

***
Liar's Dice is timeless and it is easily one of the best games of its kind in the vein of lightweight social games. Newbies will be drawn in by the novelty and simplicity of the gameplay, and the most competitive gamers will instantly take a liking to it. The nature of the game creates many memorable and tense moments, especially when it gets down to two/three-way showdowns, and calling a bid or bluff correctly feels very rewarding. Just good old fashioned FUN.

(+) It is -very- easy to teach and learn. Despite this, there is still room for strategy tempered with simple odds evaluation. 
(+) The gameplay is engaging and promotes player interaction. 
(+) The components of the 30th anniversary edition are sound in quality. I especially like the mat as it helps with tracking.

(-) Player elimination is the aim of the game. It can be circumvented with certain alternative rules (which I am not a proponent of).
(-) On that note, there are numerous house rules and alternative rules to sift through to create the "ideal" experience. I prefer not to use the rule that causes a universal loss of a die when someone was caught calling a bluff.
(-) The social dynamics can vary group to group, and I imagine there are some players out there who simply won't like the nature of bluffing and gambling in purest form.

A never-fail gateway game.  Extremely simple to introduce intimidated non gamers to, as they will generally be familiar with dice.  The only hard part is explaining the auction.

RATING: 3
This is based on one play:

It just doesn't work for me, or my gaming group.  So what if you say there are three 4's?  Should I say four 4's?  I guess I could, but it doesn't really matter.  I do understand that it's a bluffing game, but the bluffing doesn't seem to be based on much.  Yes, you take into account the little bit of information you have (your dice) and then figure the probability, but there's just not much to go on.  And I think the probability aspect was lost on my gaming group.  I guess this game *could* be fun, but I didn't enjoy my playing of it.  For a game of bluff, I enjoy You're Bluffing (Kuhhandel) or Citadels much more.

RATING: 7
29-05-2014. Rated after 2 plays on BGG, but played this game more often during high school lunch breaks. 

Very quick game, in which you take 5 6 sided dice and roll them. You keep the results hidden. Then players make increasingly more difficult bets on the number of 2's to 6s rolled. Instead of 1's, you have Jokers, that count for all other values. Instead of increasing the bet, you can call the highest standing bet a bluff. This leads the number of dice to be revealed in order to check. The one not correct loses a die and the dice are rerolled and play continues as before. 

Quick, fun filler with strong bluffing aspect.

I can see this game standing the test of time. It's already lasted over 30 years, but I can see it lasting 100+ years and influencing other game designs the entire time. It has fairly simple rules, but you're forced to either push your luck and make a bigger gamble than the person before you, or call an end to all that nonsense because there's NO WAY there's eight 6's.... there's nine 6's? Arrgh! I could have safely bid higher! No!!!! Whoever came up with this is brilliant and I would be incredibly happy if any of my designs had this sort of longevity.

RATING: 8


My favorite Liar's dice moment on film (no, not the silly squid-faced pirate movie cameo) is in one of the early seasons of 24, when that greasy PI in New Orleans is killed right after a 2p game for dirty wads of bills that he scoops up off the dive bar table and stuffs in his pockets. Before I think going into the bathroom and getting stabbed to death. Great game! That's how I want to die (right after playing a game, I mean, not through 'getting shanked next to a s$#&-stained toilet').

The game has a dirty wads of cash feel to me, even though my copy is Perudo, which has fancy colors and colored cups which immediately ruin that mood. But I need the pretty colors to get non-gamers to try it! If I get a dirty gambling game of this going, I'll just grab some old chipped dice and stained coffee mugs instead. I bet betting would add a nice buzz to this one.

Who doesn't love pushing the luck + not enough information (besides my wife, I mean)? not many, that's who. With imperfect knowledge, you don't have to be lying to someone's face...at least, not knowingly. More than a few non-gamers have told me that this is their new favorite game after playing.

stay away from the board version, it makes the game seem complex. It isn't. There's nothing more silly than waching people squint at the board and try and figure out what their next call could be. Everybody can remember 2 numbers at the same time, and then make at least one of them bigger, even if they don't think they can at first for whatever reason.

Found this game for 2.5 eur. Played by Perudo rules, which make the game more "balanced" and complex as well (still very, very light). Nobrainer, but ok.

I'm still unsure why the game playing members of my family never want to take this on?

Very simple game of bluffing and dice rolling. Slightly underwhelming at first, but after a few rounds it gets interesting as you become familiar with the nuances of your opponents' poker faces. You may find yourself wanting to play 'just one more round' before you write this one off for the evening.

Richard Borg, Ravensburger Version.

The components this edition are very good. Solid looking dice and 6 rounded black cups. The scoreboard is functional but a little confusing.

The game is best played as a driking game. Lots of loud rattling and yelling as bluffs are called. This one has push your luck and bluffing elements. Light on strategy.

Can essentially be plyed with regular dice. Good fun but a little on the light side.

Very Fun and quick game of Lying and Guessing.  Nice that it supports soo many people also.  Being playing with my in-laws, who are not gamer and enjoying it soo much.

Update: rating moved up by half point.. more I play this I enjoy it.  There is a tense psychological thing at work here, and I love it as a quick filler.

Great to pull out for parties, use two sets for more than 6 players. Never had a bad experience with this game and even non-gamers ask to play it again and again. Only negative is that early bids w/seasoned players typically start at 4 or 5 "stars"...requiring 10+ bids w/o any previous knowledge of what other players would bid. We tend to frown on this bypassing of the preliminary bidding mechanic but it does speed up the game with more players involved. It's easy to teach, has a few rules, keeps all players engaged with little downtime....simple but sweet!

I've cooled on this game.  I still think it's a great filler or party game (as in literally bringing out at a party and perhaps making it into a drinking game).  However, in the end, there's not much to it.  The bluffing aspect, in particular, is fairly limited (IMO).

Liar's Dice became stale pretty quickly. The concept is fun, though each round ends up looking similar to the previous rounds. This is especially true given the variant we play - either the number on the dice or the quantity of dice must be increased, and neither can be decreases. This almost always ends up in guessing how many 6's are on the table. That said, Liar's Dice remains a decent game to introduce to new players.

When you want maximum bluffing, there's nothing better. Leaves those who aren't into the bluffing completely out in the cold. No need to buy anything; just play with the d6s I know you have around. One of relatively few games to manage 6 or more players reasonably well. Player elimination is softened by the short playtime.

I have Pirates Dice: Pirates Of The Carribean Dead Man's Chest version. This game is fun. I have played liars dice before and really enjoyed it. When I saw this version I had to get it! This game was featured in the movie. Its a lot of fun! This doesn't get a lot of play because if you know your math which most of the people in the game groups i've been a part of do, can figure out the odds of what is left and what other people would have fairly easy. So that really takes away the fun of the game and thus people don't really like to play it.

RATING: 6
This is an okay party game.  Easy to teach, fast to play, not much to it, and good for socializing while playing.

It is a guessing/bluffing game best played with more players.  Each player gets a cup with 5 dice in it.  After rolling and looking at their dice in secret players make higher and higher declarations about how many of a certain number were rolled among all players until someone is challenged.  Then all the dice are revealed and whoever lost the challenge loses a die.

The copy I own is a 30th anniversary Animal House themed version.

Call My Bluff, Bluff, Liar's Dice ... whatever you call it, this is a great game.  The group loves this game.

Out of all of the versions available, my favorite is the Call My Bluff/Bluff versions (the versions with the star for the 'one' and a board).  Perhaps that has something to do with that being my first version of Bluff, but that's my favorite.

I'm not thrilled with the Perudo version of the game.  The Perudo rules are different enough to bug me.  Perudo is certainly pretty (love the various colors of the game pieces), but I prefer Bluff.

Il Perudo, originario del Perù, nato intorno al XV secolo, è un divertente gioco di intuito, bluff e rischio. Nessuna mappa, niente di complicato da preparare, regole semplici ed efficaci. Dovunque ti trovi, dalle Alpi alle Ande, con una manciata di dadi ed un bicchiere sarai pronto a sfidare chiunque!

Nota storica

Il Perudo, originario del Perù, nato intorno al XV secolo, risale all'epoca degli Inca. Vanta progenitori anche presso i popoli indiani del Nord America, tra i quali esisteva un gioco simile, chiamato Mocassino. Con i Conquistadores, il Perudo è arrivato in Spagna, per poi diffondersi nel resto del mondo. Sembra che fu lo stesso Atahuallpa, durante la sua prigionia, ad insegnarlo a Pizzarro.

Fun and quick game. I like it with a large number of people (between 6 and 8) because you get the feel of both a large game, and eventually (when other players are eliminated) a small game.

Called 'Perudo' on the Dutch market, great filler game when you're done playing other games but have some evening left.
And yes, all you students, this can make a FINE drinking game if you invent some house rules.

[APR 2017] Discovered two other upsides on this game. 1: no text which is a boon for dyslectics. 2: no central playing area and no visual information necessary which (might be) a boon for visually impaired people. As my current work involves producing stuff for the visually impaired, this might be a great game for them! Rating revised upwards 0.5 point.

The bluffing part is even better with players who like to "talk the talk." Short & sweet will play this anytime with 4 players plus.

I've now played this twice with 8 players and found that it is just as fun as with 4 players. Of course it's longer and more chaotic, but that just adds to the fun.

Barely a game, more just an exercise in probability.

Add in player elimination and I'll pass, thanks.

Update: Okay, so it's not quite as horrific as I originally thought - the odd, unexpected outcome can cause a few laughs, but it's still not one I'd ever seek out.

Rating up from 4.5 to 5.

Only 31 dices and one small board, but it works! Great party game for 5-6 people. Elimination is not bad, because the game is fast (10-15 minutes). I like the moment, when i bid, and think "someone will check, i won`t bid in this round again". But everybody raise the bid and the tutn comes to me ;)

It could be problems with people who are too much counting. It is only fun. Like many party games, the most fun is in the metagame. I love play this game with Trutu.

Although I started with the more brutal Perudo ruleset, I now prefer the forgiveness of the Parker Brothers edition plus a few house rules.

Not a bad game. Seems like most rounds play out the same way, though: the bidding eventually gets up to how many sixes are on the dice. Coup may replace this game for me, because it has a similar feel.

Update: Now that I've played Coup and Skull a few more times, I don't see any reason to play Liar's Dice any more. Liar's Dice may be a little more strategic because you can guess using probability, but Coup and Skull are both just a ton more fun and emphasizes bluffing a lot more.

Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 5
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 5
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 3

Some versions of this game are called Dudo.  Most will share that same sentiment when pondering their experience at game's end. 

I'm not even sure if I consider this a game or a painful activity.  It's popularity is as undeniable as it is perplexing.  Perhaps it's just me.

I suggest you give it a try and see if you can uncover just what it is that is enjoyed by the masses.  But if you asked me for my opinion - I would be inclined to recommend - that rather than reaching for this one - you should instead,  just let these dice lie.

Ah yes.  A great game, and probably the best filler of all, as there's a bit of luck, plenty of laughter, but a lot of skill in knowing when to bluff and more importantly, knowing when others are bluffing.  It's best played with the rule that you can push out dice showing the number you've just called and re-roll the remainder, as this creates constantly changing probabilities.

Okay, so technically I may not own this as a game anymore, since the parts are no longer anywhere near each other. I know for a fact I still have the dice and the cups. If I look (a lot; way in the back) I may not have thrown out the board and rules. I'm not sure why I dismantled it like that, since I always had fun playing this funky little game. I think it's because I got addicted to throwing dice by the handful. Just say no, man... just say no.

Nice and easy to make.  I converted mine from thrift store finds.  The game is nice lighter party game fare that is always exciting, if not always satisfying.  I don't really love the wilds aspect, preferring the pure aspect of the game without it.  It's an entertaining game of luck regardless.  Easy to play, and almost universally adored when I bring it out.  Everybody loves dice.  I think it's a shade overrated when it comes down to it, but it's amusing, at least.

Like Can't Stop, Bluff is a game of playing the odds, right?  Well, not really; if you can bluff your other player well enough, you have the advantage over any statistically-inclined people.  My only beef with the game is seeing it devolve into two dice and two players.  At that point, it's simply a guessing game. of how well you know your opponent (though I suppose some folks would call that part of the game the heart of it all).

Liar's Dice is a dice game where each player is given five dice and cup to roll and hide them with. Players make successively higher declarations regarding the results of all the dice remaining in the game, e.g. "there are ten sixes". However, someone can always contest the bid. When that happens, all the dice are revealed and either the bidder or the caller loses dice, depending on who was correct. The last player with dice is the winner.

Liar's dice should not be nearly as much fun as it is. It's sort of embarrassing that four plastic cups and twenty six sided dice have provided more plays (and more laughs!) than some of the $100 games in my collection, but there it is. This game is an absolute blast and we end almost every game night with it. It's simple enough that it doesn't require tons of concentration yet provides enough betting strategy and gotcha moments to keep everyone interested, even after a long day of gaming.

We use the Pirates of the Caribbean pirate dice set...Awesome dice cups and even more awesome dice!

Bleh, everything I hate about dice games and non-critical thinking games rolled into one.  Played twice with non-gamer friends while *they* were drinking, and will probably have to play again.  I have to completely turn my brain off to enjoy this game.  

It may be that the reality of the word *they* (as opposed to *we*) in the sentence above is why I did not have a great time... which says enough about how I feel about the game.

RATING: 4
This game annoys the hell out of me.  I think it's a fairly good game for what it is, but it's not my kind of game at all.

Peer pressure can get me into a game when I'm of a mood that will let me have some fun with it, but I'll sit out rather than play when I think I'll suck the fun out of it for others.

RATING: 8
Liar's Dice is one of my favorite games.  It plays quick, little / no downtime, can accommodate virtually any number of people (depending on how many dice you own), very accessible, very easy to teach, etc.  There is a huge element of bluff and double-bluff, deduction and plain old guess work.

fun bluffing game.  I originally got into this game because of the movie Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest.  I thought it looked awesome so I ordered the game.

RATING: 9
A simple mix of push-your-luck a.k.a. making educated guesses and bluffing. Bluffing itself is a form of pushing your luck in this game. It works.
A huge downside is runaway leader and player elimination though, but the game is still very enjoyable if not taken too seriously.

Played as both Bluff and Perudo.  Perudo felt a lot more "rowdy party game",  whereas Bluff everyone was way too stressed/calm - probably because you can lose a lot of dice in Bluff with a bad guess (I'm not sore that I got completely knocked out, really!) - lose one point with Bluff.  The endgame has issues though.

I have only played this two player, but it is simple fun and fast. I don't think I am very good at it because I do not have a great poker face, but the game is fast enough that it doesn't really matter.

I will leave the house in order to avoid having to listen to the cacophony of those hard, clunky dice rattling around in those hard, clunky cups.

Heerlijk blufspel. Voor op de late avond.

Spelers beginnen allen met 5 dobbelstenen en gooien deze iedere ronde. Hierna bied men stuk voor stuk op het aantal dobbelstenen met een bepaald aantal ogen die er in totaal op tafel ligt. Het bod moet altijd hoger zijn dan de volgende of je geloofd je voorganger niet en je laat iedereen de dobbelstenen zien. Diegene die ongelijk had verliest een dobbelsteen en men begint weer een ronde. Diegene die als laatste nog minstens 1 dobbelsteen heeft wint.

Played a few times face-to-face and several times on BSW (with 2 to 6 players). While uninformed bluffing is not my favourite mechanism, I tend to appreciate this game for some reason.

I own Dudo.  Liar's dice is really a whole family of games.  There are many ways to play this game.  At its core, you roll dice and hide them from your opponents.  You then bid on the quantity of a given number among all dice in play, not just your dice.  Players increase their bid until someone calls.  At that point everyone reveals their dice and someone will lose dice based on the current bid compared to the actual values of the dice in play.  Players are eliminated when they lose all of their dice.

A lot of luck, a lot of noise, and in a larger group you regularly end up with only bad choices on your turn. I'm not a great bluffer/actor, so doesn't appeal to me on that level either. It's short, so I don't mind too much if this is the game the rest of a group is shouting for.

Best "betting" game for me. Should be played by poker players. It's a game I never play just once, I have to play it several times in a row. Overall this is probably the game I have played the most. Would love to play this game for real money. ** Update; almost played this game to death now, is by far the most played in my collection.

[size=14]Bluff[/size]
Terrific game! My sister introduced me to the Swedish version of Liar's Dice called Bluff. It is a great, quick playing game all about bluffing and keeping a straight face while doing so. Awesome as a filler, or even a dedicated night of just playing this game instead of poker (perfect "beer & pretzels" kind of fun).

Bluff is a nice implementation, but the board and box are both butt ugly. At least the board is functional. I also prefer having the 1-side of the dice be wild, instead of the 6 which is the case here. The game comes with six nice dice cups, but unfortunately they don't stack, so you're stuck keeping the box.

[b]Here's how the rules of Bluff differ from Pirates Dice:[/b]
[b]#1:[/b] You lose a total of dice equal to the difference between the bid and the actual number of dice rolled, unless the bidder guessed exactly right, in which case everyone but the bidder loses 1 die. (In Pirates Dice you only ever lose 1 die in a call.)
[b]#2:[/b] You can bid the numbers 1-5 and Wilds, all in accordance with the values of the game board. (In Pirates Dice you cannot bid Skull & Crossbones, i.e. Wilds, only the numbers 2-6.)
[b]#3:[/b] The player to start the next round is always the player to the left of the caller. (In Pirates Dice the player who just lost a die starts the next round, but what happens if that player was just eliminated the rules don't say. In those cases we play that the other player involved in the call starts next instead of the eliminated player.)

[b]The basic raise options are the same in both Bluff* and Pirates Dice:[/b]
a) Increase the dice Quantity, but not the number of the previous bid.
b) Increase only the Number on the dice.
c) Increase Both the Quantity of, and Number on the dice. In both games you are allowed to increase the quantity of dice while lowering the number on the dice at the same time.
d) [i]*However, only in Bluff are you allowed to bet on Wilds, and do so in accordance with the bid values listed on the game board.[/i]

[size=14]Pirates Dice[/size]
Damn if it doesn't annoy me that the name Pirates Dice lacks an apostrophe! The game features some lovely thematic dice and dice cups, but holy heck do the cups stink! They smell like gasoline, and it cannot be cleaned away.

Liar's Dice is a classic game, there's no doubt about it, and Pirates Dice is a good implementation. I enjoy the Skull & Crossbones representing the wild on the dice, and love that it replaces the 1 (instead of the 6). It would've been even better had the game come with 6 dice cups, now you almost want to buy two sets to allow for larger games, but with the rules as is, and losing only 1 die per challenge, perhaps it's best with 4 or less players.

[b]Here's how the rules of Pirates Dice differ from Bluff:[/b]
[b]#1:[/b] You only ever lose 1 die in a call. (In Bluff you lose a total of dice equal to the difference between the bid and the actual number of dice, unless you guessed exactly right, in which case everyone but the bidder loses 1 die.)
[b]#2:[/b] You cannot bid Skull & Crossbones (i.e. Wilds), only the numbers 2-6. (In Bluff you can bid the numbers 1-5 and Wilds, all in accordance with the values on the game board.)

Perhaps this is fun with people who don't openly calculate the likelihood of how many of each number is hidden under the cups.  One player was eliminated on the first turn, and I on the second - and I was very happy to be done.

I owned this previously as a kid (still have the cups and some of the dice...) except it was "Perudo."

This proved very popular at a youth gathering I went to.  It is definately better with more people.

Not a game to take seriously, but it sure is a lot of fun.

Tried to play a 2-player session, which was a pretty lousy experience.

Previously tried a chaotic farce of a 6 player game, taught by some other chap, which boiled down to folk shouting out any old quantity and value of dice, instead of incrementing.

The use of one of the downloaded boards, to keep track of results is a good idea.

GAME: Ra: The Dice Game
RANK: 1104

RATING: 7.8
Faster-paced Ra plus press your luck mechanism and dice. What can be bad here? Answer- nothing! I'm tickled by this one- far better than Roll For The Galaxy. Recommended by Scott. M. snd Chris G.

Rahtzee.  Felt a lot like Roll Through the Ages.  I liked the interactivity of battling for Pharoahs and Pyramid spots.  Civs seemed fairly hard to get much out of, but could be brutal if you fail to get one.  River track seems worthless to me, I avoid it.

This game seems to be in a tough spot... it gets compared with both Ra and other dice games, and I think loses on both counts. I'd like to try it with two players before giving up hope, but after one play with four my expectations are pretty low.

Takes 90% of the scoring of [b]Ra[/b] and uses a completely different play mechanism.  Certainly not as cutthroat as its predecessor, this game is about 15 minutes shorter.  The turns are agonizing, and there aren't enough of them.  Great game!

Update: Crazy short with 2 players, about 15 minutes!  It packs a LOT of tension and excitement in those 15 minutes.

Ra.  With dice.  And completely unlike Ra.

Bad rolls (Ra symbols) are stupidly painful.  If you get them and I don't, then I win.  Very straight forward.  Yes, it's dice and it's luck and you have to accept that, but I don't like the implementation.

This changes Ra from a tense, exciting game into a confusing luck-fest.

This game is really difficult to explain. I had to go over the monument rules 3 or 4 times before people understood them (to people who already knew how to play and score Ra).

RATING: 1
I just don't like this sort of dice rolling and then competing in 2 million different complicated categories of points scoring. I love the original RA but in spite of its retarded scoring system, because it makes valuing the auction so much fun and also it is hard to judge your opportunity cost. Ra the dice game is similar in principle but just didn't do anything for me in my first play. It was just Ra minus the good parts.

RATING: 8
Wonderful for what it is: a light, fast and simple dice game that doesn't overstay its welcome. Clean rules, beautiful components and nice art. Every section has its own way of scoring, and you can tell the good doctor knows his dice games. Overall, I'm very happy with this game, a stark contrast with Alhambra: The Dice Game, which was a big disappointment for me.

Clever little dice game. A bit heavier than i expected with some elements of area control and player interaction.  Seemed to scale well too.  The rule book could have been a bit more clear as dropped a few rules and needed to go to BGG for clarification.

RATING: 6
Fell kind of flat for me.  I don't feel the connection between what I'm rolling and what I'm trying to accomplish, as I do in Roll Through the Ages.  The best strategy in this game is trying to figure out how to configure your monuments.  Everything else is just how well you roll.  I'd play again, but I'm not chomping at the bit for it.

Out of Print (OOP).

I think Ra the Dice Game is better than Ra the Board Game in that it is more streamlined to focus on the 4 parts of the board. The dices also help to speed things up.

I am not too concern over the auction mechanism that was lost. I like that it plays faster and the scoring of the pyramids is very interesting since the placement is important whether you get all in the same columns or at least have a cube at each of the columns.

The decision as to when to flood the nile is also important. An excellent filler.

Liking this a lot so far. It's a little like Razzia, but not so similar to be a problem. It's a very colorful game and we like the hard choices it presents. 

It plays quickly (sometimes too quickly) and there is little downtime between turns. A very enjoyable game, and a good break from our normal card and board games.

With 2-P game we start back on the 3-P space. Otherwise the game is over too soon.

Nice dices game. Is very fast, then you don't have to wait to much until your turn arrive again. As you have 3 rolls you have many choices to try to score more than the others.

Originally got this to play with my mom, who likes Ra, but doesn't like auction games. Perfect for her!

RATING: 8.5
The game that replaced tile based Ra for me. Heresy, you say? Not so fast. This game offers just as many tough decisions (which dice to re-roll, how to allocate them, etc.) as the original game with more streamlined rules in an overall more accessible package. This would probably be my 2nd favorite Knizia (after the LOTR co-op). Try this if you get a chance, you won't be disappointed.

Just another Yahtzee style dice game. The theme is just ridiculous and the game does not challenge the players. There are almost no meaningful decisions to be made and a lot of obvious ones. If you want a Yahtzee style game try Free for All or Roll through the Ages. Though very different these games are much better than Ra the dice game which basically has no reason to even exist. It's just more Knizia garbage.

RATING: 8
What I like about this game is the ways in which it is different from Ra.  The way you can strategically decide how to spend each die, but the randomness of the die roll always playing into those decisions is great. I like the way the monuments work and the fact that you have to agonize every turn over what is going to benefit you the most.

What I dislike about this game is the ways in which it is the same as Ra.  The scoring is overly complex to explain and takes almost half the game to fully understand.  Also the value of the different items are all so close to one another that it seems almost impossible to calculate what would be more beneficial.  Also it bugs me that the tempo of the game is determined completely by chance.

So, I like the game, but I don't feel the need to rush out and buy it.  It was fun to play and the decisions on each turn were interesting, but I just don't want to deal with explaining that scoring to others.  It seems that I could get a similar play experience with Roll through the Ages and not have to struggle so much in rules explanation.

I do enjoy this game quite a bit, but I can't seem to get anyone to play it, which is sad.  It's fairly accessible as long as you don't start off by telling someone it's a bit like Yahtzee, which is kind of true but gives the wrong impression, I've found.  If I can't get this played, then I'll be getting rid of it soon. 9-02-11

Finally played today.  A quick game where I forgot most of what I was supposed to do.  Consequently got my butt kicked.  Ah well, I do still enjoy this and will surely do better after my recent refresher.  9-08-11

Update: Mar 2012 - Just traded away as part of a package deal for Long Shot, Mr. Jack and Cafe International.  I won't miss this game, as every time I suggested it no one wanted to play it.  I have Ra for the iPad and I like that better anyway.

I didn't understand very well the monument track. I think after some plays the experience can be better and I want to explore a little bit on it. I'm thinking in a solitaire version.

After 3 plays, the game has grown on me. It's a great filler.

An okay dice-rolling and set collection game that has similarities to Yahtzee but stays true to much of the game objectives and scoring mechanics of Ra.  I like it for light or casual family game, but it's can run a bit long... and I think it's probably only best as a 4p game... otherwise it's too easy for all players to get lots of points from the monuments.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is an outstanding game. The different areas of scoring (which mimic the original Ra) create many juicy decisions. Each game seems to play out interestingly, providing its own "narrative". Good, meaningful decisions; just enough luck; high replay value; quick playing time. A perfect dice game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game has very little in common with RA, but it is definitely a fun quick game.  More competitive than Roll Through The Ages on the Monument matrix and Pharoah track.  There are lots of options to pursue.  I really like the Nile mechanic (just like RA) and really struggle with a good strategy on Monuments (just like RA!)

...but again, this game has very little in common with RA:

I wasn't sure how I felt about this game even part way through it.  After the second epoch though the game came alive for me.  The Ankh symbol use takes a little getting used to to begin with - but after that it is plain sailing and happy gaming!  

I really think it is quite a good little dice game.  There are a range of options to go after and the luck of the rolls are nicely mitigated through those various options avalable.  

This game should appeal to anyone who likes Ra, as the scoring mechanism is similar.  The game works very well I think.  One of the better games in recent years to use a dice mechanic - I like it.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I like this because I like the concept of the auctions and mechanics of Ra but I don't do very well at it. The yahtzee feel improves the game because you still have to choose what to go for and you can't get everything every turn and you'll be penalized for neglecting some scoring sections. The game moves quickly but the decisions are meaty. If you like both dice games and Euros, you'd dig it.

RATING: 1
Take ra, strip out the bidding, strip out the tension, strip out the push-your-luck mechanic, strip out the tiles, add stupid dice, and this is what you end up with...     an exercise in tedium.  I was so ready for this game to be over about 5 minutes into it, yet it just... kept... on.... going.   Oh, and its the same length as Ra, so you'd have to be completely braindead to want to play this instead of Ra.

This game represents everything that is wrong and disappointing with Knizia's recent trend in pushing out half-baked, creatively dead spinoffs of good games.   

Somewhere, a decade ago, the game of Ra is rolling in its grave.

Rated a 5 for presentation, -1 for gameplay, -3 because I'm sick of Knizia releasing garbage when we all know he's capable of brilliance.  Final rating, 1.

Here's hoping Knizia either returns to his old innovative ways.

One of the more interesting dice games I've played, much better than Knizia's other effort, Pickomino. The incorporation of the Ra symbols makes the game more interactive than most dice games, because the number of Ra symbols your opponents roll has a direct impact on you. The result is lots of cheering and laughter, as you shout at your opponents, hoping they don't roll any Ra's so you can have one more chance to boost your score.

RATING: 7
A very good adaptation of Ra into a dice game!  My main disappointment is that it's still another "roll 3 times and keep stuff between rolls" game... I wish designers could start thinking of more clever ways to handle dice rolling.  However, as a roll and re-roll dice game, it's a pretty good one that offers a lot of different strategic options, even though your strategy will largely be dictated by however your first few rolls end up going.

Meh! There are very few decisions to make in this game when rolling the dice. Yes, there is obviously some sort of strategy, but if the dice don’t go your way it’s hard to do anything reasonable. Yes, you can reroll which is obviously necessary in such a game, but I still think it leaves a lot to be desired.
The game takes as long to play as regular Ra – what’s up with that?! This makes no sense… It’s way too random considering its length, and I would always play Ra instead of Ra: The Dice Game!

The disasters are a nice touch but don’t change my overall opinion of a boring game. If I hadn’t tried Ra before and compare it to this new dice version (I rate Ra a 9), I actually still don’t think I would like this game as I’m not a huge fan of dice game and it’s waaay too long (it took us around 45 minutes with 4).

I was dead set against this when I heard it, as I really enjoy Ra and could not imagine how this would be worth playing.  But...  I played it, and I was amazed at how fun it was!  Major factors include very fast play, simple instructions with easy reminders available, simple scoring, and amazingly for a dice game that relies on the luck of the roll, there are still some pretty interesting decisions to be had!  Bad rolls can occasionally skunk a game, but more often than not you have many options for advancing and you almost always feel like you accomplish SOMETHING on your turn.

This is a great filler that I will play any time someone asks.

This game takes the elements I like most in Ra, and replaces it with dice-rolling. There is no more auction. While the game does retain a push-your-luck element...it ends up feeling more like Yahtzee and less like Ra. 

I'm left wondering, why do we need Ra the Dice Game?  Ra itself is only marginally longer to play...and oodles more interesting and fun. If I'm going to play Ra the Dice Game, why am I not just playing Ra?

I can't see why I'd want to play this again.  They took everything I liked about Ra ... the interaction, the poker-like tension of invoking, the fast paced play ... and replaced it with randomness and extra down time.  Roll the dice and see how you score.  Whee!  

No real way to pressure other players or overcome bad rolls.  Blech.

I like the dice. I like the strategy. I like this game. My gaming group says it's not FUN enough.  Okay, I will try to find one with a yahtzee-style mechanic that IS fun.
Traded away for FITS.
A good trade, but I want another copy.  My father and some other friends enjoyed playing this with me, so I gotta buy another copy.
I did buy another!  Super price at Boads&Bits.  I can't get enough.  Better than Yahtzee, using the same mechanic, but you get to "use" the results as a means to scoring through various channels.  For me, this a step below Roll Through The Ages, but still quite fun.

If you take the original game of Ra and remove the auctions, you pretty much have this game.  It is thus easier to learn, and the visuals on the scoring card help tremendously once you can decipher them.

In an inevitable comparison to its predecessor, for now I have to say I prefer the dice game.  It's light, fast, yet requires some tough decisions.  But there is no question that luck plays a much greater factor here, so consider that when looking at purchasing one or the other.

It ain't Ra, but it ain't bad. A few differences from the original: after the +5/-2 Pharoah scoring, the winner removes two Pharoahs, and the loser adds one; there's no counterpart to the god's tile exchange, although there are counterparts to the god and gold scoring; there's no end-game sun scoring; the monuments are rarer but generic, so they're easier to place. It's a nice change of pace from Ra, with fewer things to think about.

RATING: 6
"Can't Stop" meets "Ra".  Roll the 5xD6 dice and get some of what you would normally draw and bid on (in the regular game).  Ra's are worthless unless you end up with 3.  You get a max of 2 rerolls where you can reroll non-Ra's to try to get better results. Some things didn't seem to work too well.  The floods/nile track doesn't seem worth it (unless you really luck into it).  Also, the first player seems to have an advantage as he can more likely get extra rolls. So overall, it's just an ok game.  I think the rating could drop to a 5 w/repeat plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Players roll dice to try to position themselves for scoring opportunities.  Played over three "epochs" of Egyptian history, players on their turn get to roll 5 dice up to three times.  Ra results go onto the game clock track, but roll too many of them and you may stop the clock but trigger points or a disaster.  The other results go into the four areas of influence - pharaohs, civilization, flooding the Nile, and monument construction.  Clever adaption of the auction based parent game, and it works really well.  Scoring is pretty much lifted from the parent game, but there are no gold or gods here.  Perfectly pitched at 30 minutes play time, fast game play (although the rules aren't that intuitive and will have to be explained carefully).  Good stuff.  Bumped to a 9 after ten games - another brilliant medium-light game from Knizia.

RATING: 7
I am not a fan of Ra (I give it a 4).  Turns out I like Ra without the auction and push-your-luck aspects.  The latter is a bit ironic since this is a dice game, but the stakes are generally pretty low with the re-rolls so it feels different.  Good game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I avoided this game for a long time on the assumption that the scoring mechanisms of Ra would be uninterested once divorced form the wonderfully tense auction present in Ra. However, I actually have found the Ra dice game to be really nice.  The dice mesh with the scoring system surprisingly well, and the result is a very fun and fast game.

RATING: 6
For a Yahtzee-style dice game, I find this a perfectly reasonable filler. You have decisions as to pursue in-game versus endgame points and push your luck in various ways. 

The tension is created by the scoring rounds occurring whenever a certain number of suns are rolled. So when you pick up your dice to reroll, you may accelerate or even cause a scoring round. Sometimes you're so sure the round won't come back around to your turn without a scoring round happening but, lo and behold, it does and you feel like the luckiest guy in the world.

My group and I have a pool of end-of-night games where we want to play one more short game but don't want to think too hard. This fits the bill.

The auction element from Ra has been replaced with dice. Scoring is otherwise the same. Basically, if you like Ra, and you like dice, you'll like Ra Dice.

Despite hating Ra, and never wanting to play Ra ever again, I was tricked into playing Ra The Dice Game. It's Ra with dice. So it's still Ra then. Still that annoyingly over-complex scoring/penalty process, but with the added restriction of rolling dice in certain colours.

Meet the new Boss, same as the old Boss.

Roll Through The Ages is better.

Played once.  It's just what it says - a dice version of Ra.  Fun, if confusing at first.

Played again.  A lot more fun now that I've figured out the scoring.  So far the monument strategy seems to be dominant.  I assume that's a stage we'll pass through. 

Played again and again.  This is a great 2 player game for my partner and I.  A very fun dice game that goes well with drinks! 

Update 12/4/2012. After my 20th logged play I've upgraded this from 8 to 9, because this game has never failed to satisfy me.

RATING: 6.8
I like the game, and for me it moves a little faster than RA.  I also like quickly being able to assess the position others are in the game.

I found the rules rather fuzzy on several points.  You can roll the dice 3 times, unless they are suns; when the sun track fills on someone's turn, the dice are placed off the board; when scoring the Pharaoh during an epoch, award pts AND, on the Pharaoh track, highest & lowest markers are moved.  The features on the board are never described--you have to read about the dice symbols and figure the board out.

All said, I will probably chose to play Ra the Board Game over the dice game.

A dice game version of Ra that faithfully retains most of the scoring rules of the original but replaces the auctions with Yahtzee-style dice rolling. I'm not really sure where the need for a game like this came from. It doesn't reduce the complexity or the playtime of the original but removes the parts that were responsible for the tension and made Ra special. One of the most superfluous dice re-implementations I've come across. Its only use is to emphasize how much better the original is.

SUPER HAPPY AWESOMENESS CHRISTMAS GIFT FROM CAITY & BRIAN, 2013!

It isn't easy making a dice game that feels like one has enough control to make it engaging. Ra:tDG does not disappoint. Essentially, one has a variety of options and may play risky to meet them or fiddle around with what lady luck gives them the first time around. The wild 'ankh' symbols is what gives the decisions some extra umph. Nice, competitive feel as well. Actually gives some of the flavour of Ra: The Board Game. Can obviously feel a bit repetitive at points and you have to rely on an endgame scenario that in theory could never actually come (making the game of the length quite variable) but overall this is a cool game and I'm quite happy with it.

[i]Official Set-up answer[/i]
The image in the rule-book is incorrect; the Pharaoh and Nile cubes should start to the left of the '1' space on each track (essentially on the '0' space).

Ra: The Dice Game startede jeg med at være forsigtig positiv i forhold til. Der er siden kommet en overflod af andre terningspil, der også prøver at indføre nye mekanismer og mange af disse gør det på mere elegant vis end Ra: The Dice Game. Jo flere gange jeg har spillet jo flere gange har jeg oplevet at gå frustreret og irriteret fra bordet, når spillet er slut og det er faktisk ikke en følelse jeg har særlig ofte - ihvert tilfælde ikke når jeg har spillet spil. Den relativt korte spilletid er bestemt en formildende omstændighed og derfor vil jeg også sagtens kunne lokkes til at spille spillet. Men godt er det ikke!

Instead of the tension of auctions, you have the luck of the dice and press your luck. Ra without the auctions, just isn't Ra. Other dice games out there (Roll for the Galaxy for one) are more attractive to play, particularly since this is very mathy, with little to no theme. It starts feeling quite repetitive very quickly- very dry. I suppose it is sought after because it’s harder to find now and it beats playing Yahtzee.

There's no one thing about this game that is awful.  It is however, unoriginal, uninspired, and retains the scoring of RA, which is not intuitive unless you've played a lot of Ra.

At first I liked it a lot. I saw the flaws and the randomness but I had fun. Second play made the randomness to the main issue of the play. If you can't plan ahead and your opponents may with one move ruin what you have achieved with great effort, maybe it's just better to play Yathzee? At least you get what you expect...

Pretty impressed with how Knizia distilled the set collection aspect of an auction game and turned it into a lighter dice game. It's no Ra, but it is a nice lighter variant. Components are nice, but the rules aren't great. Despite this being lighter than Ra, I wouldn't say this is a gateway game, especially with the scoring of monuments. It's quick to grasp if you've played Ra.

RATING: 6
I like Ra: The Dice Game, but it does not shine with 2 players. It seems that the rounds end too quickly for us. Maybe that's because I ALWAYS roll two suns on my first roll and never roll another sun on the same turn. 

The components are nicely designed and produced, but the box is about 5 times larger than it needs to be to contain them. 

We are interested to see how this game compares with its parent, Ra.

Twenty plays! My favorite dice game; there's a good amount of drama packed in there, there are a lot of options on every turn, and the decisions are usually pretty interesting. It's fun to try and chase the big points payouts, and it's especially fun when you actually pull one off. However, like any dice game, there's a luck factor, and unusually lucky or unlucky rolls will make or break you. 

I've seen some unfavorable reviews saying, essentially, "it's like Ra, except with all the interesting parts removed." I can understand that reaction, but if you actually [i]want[/i] a dice game, this is a great one.

On a side note, I like the game best with two or three; with four players it can drag a bit and feel like a middleweight with too much luck. Three might be the sweet spot.

If you like dice games like Yahtzee and you like Ra, you must get this! Excellent synergy between the two. Scoring mechanism of Ra coupled with a nice variant of the Yahtzee mechanic. After nine plays, still enjoying this. One game seemed to go on too long since 1-2 suns were rolled very infrequently. This resulted in everyone maxed out on Pharaohs and Niles and the monuments being almost completely built be everyone. Still, that's dice for ya!
EDIT after >30 plays, this is proving to be a go-to filler. Very quick with 2.

Ok, the few games I've heard that this will replace are: Ra, Roll through the Ages and Monopoly Express.  There is no auction in this game and other then the scoring, I don't get the same feel from the game.  The original Ra has more 'press your luck' then this game, so why Monopoly Express?  Ok, so Roll and Ra are both rolling dice to 'build civs', but really they do feel different to me.  I guess it's because of the economic component of Roll that isn't in Ra.  

Still it's a quick fun game.  It may be too quick of a game about 60% of the time.

Knizia is undisputably the master of dice games, and this may be his best. It's perhaps a touch longer than what most would want out of a dice game, but man it's cool--the grid system for monuments, in particular, is inspired. I am unsure how much it feels like Ra, aside from the obvious similarities in terms of pushing your luck, but I really don't care.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I normally hate dice games, but this one isn't terrible.  It's actually a pretty good filler game, because you can finish it in 30 minutes or so, and not feel too bad about your terrible dice rolls because you can go on to the next game.

There is curiously more control in this game than in the original Ra game, where you are totally at the mercy of what tiles show up.  In this game, you can more easily get monument or civilization sets because you can choose to take one in the same column (well, if the right coloured die shows up).  It's also nice that the last place in pharoahs gets a bonus of +1 pharaoh (and the first place loses 2 pharoahs!) at the end of each epoch.

It's an important strategy to consider re-rolling all remaining dice if you already have 2 suns, because getting another sun is worth 3 points and can lengthen the game.  Of course, rolling 4 or 5 suns is worth no points, but it hurts other players because you force them to remove cubes from the board which could be worth a lot of points (e.g. civilized people, monuments, or floods).

There are a couple of unclear points: do all players start on the space labelled "1" for nile and pharoahs, or at "0" (off the track)?  The rules show a picture on "1".  But if a disaster strikes, the rules talk about "reduce by 2, but not below zero", but I think they might mean "not below 1".  Also, in what order do players remove monuments or civilization markers in case of a disaster?

After loving Ra so much, I figured I'd like the dice game just the same.  I totally did.  The board/dice give the game a smaller sense of scale, which is nice for fewer players.  It went by a lot faster than the bigger game, which worked well for our play session.  It successfully captured the feel of the original into a dice version.

Enjoyed immensely.

Not only do I hate this game because of the way it plays, but I also hate it because it took something I love and made a mockery of it.

If you like Ra, stay away from this game because they are nothing alike.

If you've never played Ra, go get Ra instead.

A nice ra-ized yatzee that play fast, gives the illusion of actually building something, very light but pleasing.  Nice to the eye, too. Simple, lots of decisions, no brain burning.  Knizia classy, and a must own for those who like dice games.

A very solid dice-roller. As a Ra nut I had to try it and was pleasantly surprised. Not an all-time classic like Ra of course, but the brilliant scoring of that game translates well here.

There is a special quality to this game that is very hard too define. The dice feels nice to roll, the board is beautiful in a very discreet way and although the point system at first seems to be a bit unintuitive it makes good sense. And the different parts just come together and creates a whole which at the same time is both fun, simple and hard to figure out.

Indifferent - the random drawing tiles in RA is replaced by re-rolling dice, which gives lot more control to what one can get. So RA is a game about "deciding WHEN to get but NOT WHAT to get", which is fresh and unique. However, the dice version is about WHAT to get, which is just too ordinary.

What do I think? Just behind Roll Through the Ages as the best dice game. It doesn't have developments from RTTA, but it still lets people diverge on what they do.

And the scoring is very familiar to the Ra crowd. You can still chant Ra if you really want the round to end.

I liked it plenty and see it hitting the table a lot.

As I finished my first game, someone commented that it had all the good stuff of Ra without the auctioning mechanism that they didn't like.  I'm not a fan of the auction, either, so not a bad description.

Dice games are probably just not my cup of tea, but despite being a big fan of its parent game, Ra: The Dice Game failed to impress. I like the theme, and the (brilliant!) scoring is basically lifted directly from Ra, but in terms of game flow and tension, Ra: TDG seems to have just taken out everything that made Ra so brilliant. The auctions are gone, and in its place we have a much less interactive game with downtime introduced in its place.

For a light dice game, Ra: TDG is probably OK. Mechanically better than most I have tried, if not as interesting as, say, Airships. TDG is accessible to casual gamers where Ra might not be, but that doesn't mean I have to like it. ;-)

A simplified version of RA (w/o auction) that plays very well with 2.  If you're not already familiar with the tile game RA, these rules can be confusing and down right vague at best.

RATING: 7
Anyone that has played Ra could pretty much predict how the game would turn out.  I was a little surprised with some of the little exceptions and rules twists regarding monuments and civilizations, mainly because Knizia's rules are usually so clean.  But still, the scoring system is very similar, almost identical, to its parent game, though the game itself plays very differently.

It is very much a typical dice rolling game, becoming more about set collection, subject to the luck of your rolls, more akin to something like Roll Through the Ages, especially when considering the sun faces on the die.  I like the way that you can potentially rack up a bunch of pharoahs or rivers much more easily than in the boardgame (though getting floods is more difficult). I also enjoy the interaction in the monument rows by blocking your opponents, which I guess also happens in a similar way in the original.

I enjoy the game, it's different enough from Ra to not feel too derivative, but my main complaint is that it doesn't play much faster.  Why play the dice game if you can play the original in about the same amount of time?  In my mind it's a passable substitute, but offers little to no improvement on the original.

Comment after 2 plays (with a couple of rules goofs):

Even though the scoring system is very similar to Ra, it doesn't FEEL like Ra.  There is not as much of the push your luck element, but there is a little more strategic control of what elements you want to go for.  

The game it FEELS the most similar to is Roll Through the Ages (though you don't have the building cities).  I haven't played enough to tell, but I think I prefer RTtA.

2018-01-12 - 7 - Of course it's not as good as the original game, but hey, nothing is! That being said it's really good. Everyone who played Ra will find familiar concepts of scoring, but approached from a different way. It's a much lighter game than Ra in terms of player engagement. It doesn't require to get into the players heads which is one of the greatest things in Ra, but sometimes you just want to play something less engaging. The risk management here is pretty clever and bad luck rolls (a lot of the suns) are very well mitigated by the rules. After getting the rules by myself I'm surprised how well this one works after an actual play.

I have no desire to ever play this game again.  If the powers that be would have themed this game around something else other than RA, perhaps I would have enjoyed it.  However, this game pales greatly in consideration, and I've much rather play the original game in the same amount of time.  I did think two parts of this game were fairly clever - if a disaster did happen the person who rolled such does get to pick from the four options and hurt their opponents...the second was the monument placing mechanism/scoring is interesting if everyone gets competitive in the track and gets in each other's business.

Nifty port of the great Ra into a dice game. The table agreed that the agonizing decisions of the original RA auction were missing, but replaced by the press-your-luck feel of the dice. Otherwise it feels very much like Ra, only it plays in half the time. I loved it!

Mediocre implementation of the RA mechanics in a dice format.  I much prefer the original tile pulling and more interesting scoring mechanism in Ra itself.

Not "another themed Yahtzee game" as I initially dismissed this. This is actually one of the few dice games out there in which the presence of the other players matters beyond "Oh no there are three of us but only two wubbles available!"

We had both enjoyed Ra, so the dice game version seemed like a good fit, especially as a quicker version of the game that we could play. We ended up getting a copy through a trade to try out.

I enjoyed the game, particularly in how the dice interacted. Unlike other Yahtzee-variants, Ra: The Dice Game did have a central board that enforced some player interaction, particularly in the monuments track. It was also nice that disasters were not necessarily a bad thing either, so there was always something that you could aim for with your dice roll. However, my wife really disliked it---I think she generally just doesn't like dice games and she complained that there was no strategy and that you just followed what the dice told you to do. Despite my attempts to convince her otherwise, this was a flop for her.

This is the best dice multiplayer dice game of this style that you can play. It's tense, fun, and I actually don't care about winning or losing; I just love seeing if the gambles you take every turn pan out.

It's like Ra in feel and much in function yet still keeps it's own identity. Reiner has also done a great job of mitigating the penalties that could have been associated with the suns or ankhs. 

5 plays in less than a week of ownership says it all, and that's with all numbers; so it scales beautifully to boot.

Roll dice to allocate cubes to various tracks on the board. Certain tracks give certain bonuses. When we played there did not seem to be anyway of beating someone who kept flooding the nile. Maybe there was a rule wrong..

Consider making a dice version of this game first. See DIY below (or Cuzco's variant: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/507425/ra-goes-to-cuzco) BUT play the auction version of RA first; otherwise, I might end up with kids who don't want to play the auction version at all.

Many comparisons to Roll Through the Ages have been made. There does NOT seem to be a clear preferred game (although RTtA gets a better ranking on BGG). It SEEMS that RA the dice game is more interactive than RTtA b/c there are spaces on the board that can only be held by one player whereas RTtA seems like multi-player solitaire.

NB: Can be scored withOUT pen and paper (unlike RTtA).

Tom Vassel enjoys this more than regular Ra b/c of the dice element, the lack of auction element (as in original RA), and the faster playing time. The lack of auction element and faster playing time is also why he favors Modern Art The Card Game over the original Modern Art auction-based game.

This can be played quickly (with some 2 player games lasting as little as 15 minutes).

CON: There is no auction.

It's like Ra, but with dice and without the interesting core (bidding, interaction).
Being definitely inferior to Ra, despite not being shorter, means it has no reason to be played.

11-26-12-haven't played this as much lately (cult of the new plus obsession with Kingdom Builder!) but it really is a fun game and glad we got it out today.  won't let it go so long again without playing!

12-31-11-This is absolutely our favorite game.  No one EVER says no to another game of Ra Dice.  The more we play, the better we get and the tighter our scores.  Many dismiss this as a dice fest and Yahtzee cone, but once you're familiar with the scoring, you can usually play it much more smartly than would seem at first glance.   

Played 3 times today, once 3p, and twice 2p.  I'm pretty sure this is going to be a favorite!  At first it seemed confusing, but then it came together very quickly.  Still couldn't seem to pull off a clean win though.  Tied for 1st once (3p) and lost the other 2 games, the last one by one point!

Casey's favorite because it's fun and so quick.

RATING: 7
This is superb as a two-player game. The rules sound a bit fussy at first, but a couple throws of the dice into the game they flow just fine. I bought it to play with my wife, who likes Yahtzee (a game I can't stand), because it looked like "Yahtzee with a point" and we both like Knizia games. It delivers.

Every roll has a basic push your luck element to it, but underlying that are multiple layers of risk vs. reward; short, medium, and long term pushing your luck; timing calculations about what might pay out, and when; and just the right amount of "Yes!" or "Crap!" from the dice themselves. The dice nicely truncate the option set each turn, while still leaving room for strategy and forcing interesting tactical decisions.

There are tons of levers to pull, some of which are quite subtle, and every turn is full of turn angst -- though not so full as to be brain-burning: For two, this is a filler game, but it's meaty and satisfying filler.

Overall, I'm impressed (though not, given its designer, surprised) at how satisfying, pleasant, interesting, and above all elegant Ra is. It's so simple, yet it's packed with good stuff -- and it begs to be played more than once in a sitting.

Enjoying this dice game.  Love how interactive it is as players compete to do better in each area.Highly recommend it for a dice game.  Better with 3/4 than 2.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
It's not revolutionary. It's not blow-your-hair-back fun. It's certainly not a brain-burner. Nevertheless, it IS a gem. Why?

1. Short playtime--2 player game in 15-25 minutes. This might be what I like best about this game, and I don't think that's a bad thing. In less than a half hour, you can have a fun time and make some interesting tactical/strategic decisions. 
2. Easy setup--This sort of ties into #1, but any game that you can set up this quickly, and actually has a good amount of bite to it, deserves props. 
3. Nice components--The dice are nicely engraved, the boards are of a sturdy stock (not Trajan thick, but definitely not Notre Dame thin), and the cubes are perfectly serviceable. 
4. Cute art/theme--Yes, it's an Knitzia abstract, but it's at least tastefully pasted on here, IMO. 
5. Scalability--Possibly plays best with 2 (if you want to keep playtime short, but scales nicely between 2 and 4 players. 

I was really apprehensive about getting this game. I was lucky enough to find it at my local FLGS, way after it went out of print. I'm glad I found it. What a terrific game!

Update 4/23/2015:

Still great. It's just a nice break from some of the heavier fare, while still offering interesting choices, a colorful board and solid mechanics.

Scoring is very similar to that of regular [i]Ra[/i] but game play is much different since there are no auctions.  You have much less control than in the standard version as there is no way to force other players into making tough decisions.  Each turn a player decides what to do for himself and often the correct choice is clear.  That being said the game is much shorter and there are still some interesting decisions.  This version is more likely to be enjoyed by families and non-gamers or by gamers as a filler.

RATING: 6.5
Quite like it, althought it always seemed to take longer to play than we anticipated.  Explaining the rules always seemed really complicated, although once people started playing it all clicked really easily.

The biggest thing we struggled on with this game was that... well... its a dice game with a small board, and it turns out that that means really noisy!.  Its the first dice game we'd played really - we like Stone Age, but that's got a large board which you can roll on.  

At home we play on a glass table and end up cringing every time we roll.  At work we're in an open plan office and there just isnt really any way we can play this without disturbing everyone.

So, sort of like the game, wasn't an oh my god must play again, which we've had from some other games, but it was ok.  At the same time the noise factor did really revise my thoughts on the practicalities of some dice games! :/

I hate almost all dice versions of board games. This one is an exception, and my second favorite (behind Zooloretto).

Played once as a two player game, twice as a three player game.


A dice version of the classic Ra game, this is actually exceptionally well done.  I think the dice mechanism is much cleaner than the passing around a giant bag of tiles, and the artwork and board design is much cleaner too.

Essentially, players roll five different-colored dice that have 6 symbols on them.  The symbols and color of the dice dictate what the player can do, and the player can choose to re-roll any dice up to two times.  It's a classic Knizia, in that there are multiple paths to victory that are all a bit fiddly.

There's a ton of luck in the game, but it's also extremely quick.  My first game, including rules, took less than an hour, and future games should cut that in half easily. So, you get the well-balanced gameplay of Ra with a easy setup and well designed board.

No, it's actually not that bad. If it was a print and play game, I'd call it pretty good. However, painting it with the same theme brush as Ra without the core mechanism (that would be the auction) just left me expecting more.

This is an impressive, thoughtful, and interesting dice game. It is remarkable how adept Reiner Knizia is at reworking his games in original ways. After playing this a dozen times I am intrigued at how differently each game plays itself out. As with many Knizia games, I enjoy how much happens in such a short period of time. The production is somewhat subpar as the board colors are dull, I have a hard time reading the yellow die, and the play-aid cards are forcing me to upgrade my magnifiers. I find this game immensely enjoyable. It's skillful without being overwhelming and great fun to play.

Easily my favorite dice game.

Once you have the all the ins and outs of how to 'cash in' your dice this is really a playable game with a great playing time.

Works quite well 2,3 or 4. 
The dynamic is slightly different with each number of players in the game.

I like the tempo of the game, sometimes eras last a long time sometimes they are over before you know it. The game can pick up a pace of excitement when a player goes for a  disaster roll at an important time in the game.

Played this over 50 times now and I still find it to be a fun and tension filled game playing experience.

Don't forget to start all the pieces at 'zero' just off the scoring track at the start.

This has become a bit of a favourite for the lunchtime gaming crowd who meet at work. It plays well, the rules are pretty simple and there seem to be several good strategies with no one approach dominating. Scales well with 2-4 and the production values are quite good too. The push-your-luck dice element really works for this game.

A lot of fun and a pretty good way to spend a lunchtime.

I admit dice games do not seem to be my cuppa... even last year's famous Favor Of The Pharaoh seemed like merely a good game to me.
This is cute, some deciding, some luck, thrilling and not overly long - probably my favorite dice game so far. Will yet have to play with more than 2 players, which I assume will be better. A keeper definitely, but doesn't reach the beautiful brilliance and risk-weighing of Ra: The Original.

I was cynical about the need to offer this dice title given the quality of the original but I was pleasantly surprised. The auction/bidding mechanism of the original is replaced with a 'push-your-luck' dice mechanic. The scoring is much the same as the original but it is all much easier to see the relative positions of the players on the one board.

The real beauty of this title however is that it allows 2 players to play well as opposed to the original game. At the asking price it is worth the investment.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Not quite as good as its parent game, but I see this getting more play among those who find auction games a little boring. Really distills a lot of the feel of the board game into a dice game without really adding much in the way of anything new. I think going for the Nile and monuments seems to be the way to go, but you can't ignore the citizens or pharaohs in a smaller player game. All in all, it's pretty balanced, and offers up the same feeling of Ra in a (surprisingly) shorter time frame.

Each player rolls five different colored 6 sided dice. You can re-roll any dice, twice if you like. The possible sides are : 1) sun, 2) Ankh, 3) boat, 4) monument, 5) civilization, 6) pharoh. The boats, pharohs, civilization and mounment are all similar to the original board game; you move markers if you roll those. Ankh count as wild and mix with the others to give more of that kind. The sun tile cannot be used by the player and keeps track of Ra's movement toward the end of an epoch; however, three rolled suns give the player 3 pts, and a disaster of his choice to remove other player's tokens.

It's an okay game, but I would rather play the boardgame. I have only played once, so I would like to get a couple more plays in. Not sure yet how much luck plays a part.

I think I'd enjoy playing it's parent, Ra, but this game has enough for me.  It holds together as a unified game, and simply doesn't need anything more.

Fast-paced and simple to grasp without being mindless or shallow.  Very recognizable Kniziesque scoring.  Knowledge of parent game not required.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Unfortunately it sucks if you roll more Ra symbols than evrybody else. It is like playing with fewer dice. It might work better if you can re-roll Ra's, then after your final roll you can change any of your dice into a Ra. That way you are not so hamstrung by having the bad luck to roll Ra's on roll 1, and can still do something with any useless dice you have at the end of your turn.

Perhaps it should be mandatory to convert unused dice into Ra's after your last roll, to ensure the game doesn't stall.

the title says it all: a dice game with the scoring system of ra. players decide to allocate dice to one or more of the scoring areas (pharaos, nile, civilizations, monuments) with two rethrows allowed. one or two thrown ra symbols make the three eras of the game move forward, four or five of them lets you disrupt your opponents plans as a catastrophe. in a four player game there were about four turns per player per era, so they felt a bit short in that there was too little time and control to accomplish enough. on the other hand the repetitive nature of dice throwing felt a bit boring. the game is put together as well as possible, but I don't think it was a good idea to make a dice game out of ra.

This dice / express version really captures all of the original.  I actually prefer this version to the original.  The components can be stored in the box with the original so you can play either based on your group.

The set collection of the original is captured by the rolling of the dice.  The only portion of the original that is gone is the auction phase.  Instead you get to roll the dice each turn.  It plays quick too.

This is one dice / express variant that won't leave you wanting for more and ready for a game of the full version.

[b]Ra: The Dice Game[/b] was traded away in a math trade 9/14/14. (Received Cubist)
Has since been reacquired - TotalCon 2017 auction purchase.


[COLOR=#FF0000]A 2017 update... (8):[/COLOR]

Since I originally traded this away I've come to realize just how good Ra Dice is after playing a lot of dice games [i](which are among my favorite types of games)[/i]. The list of games I bought/traded for and then got rid of is long and I would occasionally get the chance to play Ra Dice and understood just how good of a design it is. It definitely falls close to Cubist in terms of play time/weight, it is more than a filler but not quite as deep as something like Roll for the Galaxy. The one caveat I have is that it is at it's best with 3 or 4, but I don't think I'll have a problem getting this played.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]This is one of those games that I really enjoy and will happily play my buddy's copy whenever it gets brought out, but it wasn't better than any of the dice games we already own (Cubist, [-]VivaJava: The Coffee Game: The Dice Game[/-], Qwixx and [-]Würfel Bohnanza[/-]) so it got traded. 

As an aside the ties to Ra are thematic only, this game has nothing in common with Ra (which is an amazing auction game).[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I bought a copy of this at a local FLGS because I knew it was hard to find and I really wanted to find a dice filler I enjoyed that plays well with two. Mat taught me this game (2p which he told me was not an ideal player count) and while it was fun, I knew it was not what I was looking for. I can see how it would be really fun with more players, since there would be much more competition over certain areas (monuments comes to mind).
The scoring penalties wouldn't be so harsh either, since usually the person with the least amount of something receives the penalty. 

I would really like to play this with more players, because I know I would enjoy the game a lot more. However; I am going to trade my copy, mostly because I know this game would not see much play with my whole family (too many other games we want to play with 4) and the 2p game is not that fun.[/i]

Excellent dice game in its own right, plus there's a nice linking back to the original making it intuitive to pick up and play. With really only 4 things to shoot for, turns are fast, but there are some nice re-roll decisions to make when the dice are leading you down a path you don't prefer. Group consensus was that it’s better than Roll Through The Ages, but I like both so it doesn’t matter.

An Excellent, Classy, Fun, Quick-Playing, Press-Your-Luck Dice-Chucking Euro !! (A category not easily and successfully done, IMO.)

This is Knizia's Egytian-Themed Ra, but with Yahtzee-Style Dice-Rolling and with No Auctions. It really really works!! It's casual, light, fun, tactical, slightly strategic, easy to play and teach, colorful, well-designed, and has a great feel to the gameplay. Custom Dice !! You don't have to like RA at all to love this!! Plays great 2-player, too! Count on 10-15 minutes per person.

"Yahtzee-style dice rolling combined with wacky Knizia scoring. I like it better than Ra."

What I like:
- Knizia scoring system is really clever
- Yahztee rolling makes it comfortable for non-gamers
- Egyptian theme is thin, but is a nice atmosphere
- Plays quick, especially 2p (30 minutes)

What I don't like:
- Has some quirky little rules you have to remember
- Can run a bit long with 4p (one game was 90+ minutes)

Surprisingly, I enjoy this much more than Ra. In a 5p game of Ra, I felt like I had less control than in Ra Dice. Ra Dice is a great couples game, and a good gateway as long as you are careful explaining the scoring.

I think the 1.7 BGG-voted weight is reasonable. For non-gamers, I prefer this over Roll Through the Ages, because is feels more familiar in several ways.

Ra Dice is somewhat similar to Roll Through The Ages.  RttA may offer a bit more strategy if played with the Late Bronze Age expansion, but Ra Dice has much more player interaction  and because of that it's the game I would prefer to play.  It will take a game or two to get used to the scoring, but after that it's easy to understand.  I could easily see this as a go to dice filler for that 20 to 30 minute time frame.  I have heard of some 4 player games going well over an hour, but I have not had that experience at all.  This is one of a handful of games I enjoy playing multiple times in a row.

This game combines Ra scoring with a yahtzee-style dice mechanic instead of auctioning tiles.  I was a little annoyed by the downtime, as there's really nothing to do while it's not your turn.  I really miss the auctions from Ra, I think that's the best part of the game.  This game is fairly comparable to Roll Through the Ages, though this does have better components.

Ra: The Dice Game is very simple to pick up, at least if you know Ra (and everyone should!). The scoring is almost identical. What has changed is the way you acquire "tiles": instead of auctioning, you get them by throwing dice combinations. Unfortunately, the new mechanism doesn't have the elegance of the old "draw a tile or call Ra" thing. It's a good game, but I see no reason why I'd ever want to play this instead of Ra (except maybe for solo or 2-player games?)

A reasonable dice-based take on the board game, with much of the same scoring involved.

No more portable than the original board game, but plays better with 2 since there is no auction involved. Also plays quite quickly.

RULES UPDATE:
"Reiner Knizia confirms that the intent of the rules was to start at zero on the Pharaoh and Nile tracks, which is to the left of the tracks as printed, rather than at one as illustrated in the current rules."

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
From reading the rules I like how the amount and ownership of each type is centralised rather than tile displays in front of each player in the boardgame version, makes comparing to get an idea of scoring status alot easier. 
Another plus with the dice especially for newbies is that it removes the headache of assessing the tile distribution in the original. However, this then takes away any probability skill and especially non-turn player interest which dice rolling tends to kill off. 
Overall I think I'll wait to play someone else's copy.

Ra: The Dice Game is a really sub-standard re-implementation of a Knizia classic. Both this and Masters Gallery stripped out the soul of the original games by removing the auction and retaining only the scoring system. But while MG ended up as a decent filler, Ra:TDG is just dull. If I'm going to play a Knizia yahtzee variant I would much rather it was Risk Express, which is at least fun.

This game is a lot of fun. Sure it has a fair amount of luck but playing well is all about investing in both long and short term strategies.  It is simple and plays super fast once every one has the scoring system down.  It usually leaves you wanting more and can become addictive. It is excellent with 2.

I guess this game is fun if you forget it's based on Ra.  However, it's "Ra: The Dice Game," so that's unlikely.  Basically, this is Ra, but without the ability to invoke an auction (Ra) which is the heart and soul of Ra.  And it's not like Ra is a really long game.  So, you remove what makes Ra great, add dice, and cut out less than half the time . . . and you get this.  Now I'm just waiting for "For Sale: The Dice Game..."

What, does Knizia just roll out of bed one day and say, like, "Hey, I know what I'll do today. I'll roll out of bed and turn Ra into a *dice game*." What the fuck? Where does his decision process come from?

In any case: this is a damn fine game. It's not the subtle interactive wild perfection of Ra, but it also doesn't keep me awake with my heart hammering for hours. It's chill. I play it to bring me down from harder games. It's like a digestif.

I like all the blocking - a decent substitute for the interactivity of the auctioning of the parent.

So far I have hated most dice games derived from popular board games...  Alhambra dice had me swearing off these cheap ill thought-out games...   until Ra: the Dice Game.

I love Ra and couldn't imaging how it would translate, but it does and beautifully at that.  The push your luck element is so good in this because, (like the original game) you are trying to manage so many of the different symbols.

Great game.

Unnecessary dice version of Ra. Plays easily under 30 minutes and easy to pick up if you have played Ra before. The scoring and the theme are the same but the game mechanic has been replaced by Yatzy-type rolling of dice. If you have played Ra this is probably useless. Also if you never played Ra the scoring might be hard to grasp in the beginning. I guess this works nicely for those who never played Ra and are taught this game by somebody who has played it. Probably won't play again.

This has improved in my estimation after a few plays. It's quick and kind of like gambling. The scoring is like Ra, but with no auctions and an unlimited supply of any one item I don't think it's anywhere near as good as the board game. No auctions - there goes the angst and much of the tactics you can employ. Unlimited items - I miss being able to count the tiles. You're also sitting around watching a lot of dice being rolled and rerolled, instead of just pulling one tile from a bag - it loses much of the suspense. Functional, but uninspiring.

It takes some concepts of the base game and redesign them in a way that everythig seems new, even when you can also see the link with its predecessor. [i]Um Krone und Kragen[/i] is all about control and getting more dice. This one is about managing your rolls and luck and to know where and when to score what. Both have tight breathtaking endings and tough decisions all over.

Meet "Ra-htzee." This is the Ra with the bidding elements removed and the "bid lot" determined by dice rolls.  The scoring remains nearly intact, which is great for me because that's what I loved most about Ra. What I liked least in Ra was the bid lot generation. So, for me, Ra: The Dice Game is an all-around better Ra.

There are five dice each in a different color. You get three total rolls max. You may set any dice aside but you must set aside suns. Collect 3 suns to earn 3 VP. Collect 4 or more to trigger a disaster (and afflict it on your friends!). Fewer suns just move Ra that number of spaces along the epoch track. There are 3 epochs. Monuments only score at game end, but all other "tracks" score at epoch end. The epoch ends at the end of any player's turn where Ra has moved to the last space of the epoch track.

Roll one pharaoh head to move your marker one space along the pharaoh track. Ankh results may be used to move you further. This track awards 5 points to the leader(s) and takes 2 from the loser(s). Additionally a catch-up mechanism moves the leader(s) back 2 and the loser(s) up 1.

One boat moves your marker along the river track. Then ankhs and boats may be used for additional movements. Or use three dice (1 boat, and 2 boats and/or ankhs) to "flood" your section of the river (represented by putting a cube on top of your river cube). Only a flooded river scores points (position on track = points). After scoring, unflood your river.

Three hierogylphs let you put a marker on of the five colored Civilization spaces. You must put the marker on a space matching the color of your hieroglyph die. Similarly, four hieroglyphs will let you place two markers, and five will let you place three. You may substitute up to two ankhs as a hieroglyph, but you may not place cubes on those Ankh colors (only the colors matching the hieroglyph dice can take markers). These markers are removed at epoch end, but not before giving you 5 points if you have 3 cubes there, 10 points for 4, and 15 points for 5. Having NO cubes on the civ spaces costs you 5 points!

Finally there are the monuments. This is an 8x5 matrix, where the rows are a different color. 1 pyramid symbol lets you place 1 cube on an empty space. 3 pyramids let you place 2 markers, and 5 for 3. Again, at most two ankhs may be substituted for pyramids, but only the colors matching the pyramid dice may receive markers. Additionally, when you place multiple markers, you must put them in different columns. At game end the monuments are scored two ways. First, you get paid 1 for each column that has at least one of your cubes. 7 columns bumps the payout 10 points, and 8 columns to 15 points. Second, you get paid for columns that have three or more of your cubes in them. 3 gets you 5, 4 gets you 10, and 5 gets you 15.

A sleeker, but satisfying version of Ra. Stay away if what you love most about Ra is the bidding. But if you love the scoring, this is your game.

A very solid and fun dice take on Knizia's Ra series.  Quick and easy-to-learn, my 6 year-old daughter picked it up in no time and totally loved it.  You are not bound by the dice, since you get two re-rolls and you can keep and swap out any non-suns.  Ankhs add a wildcard element as well.  Well done and not leaving my collection.

RATING: 7
Played for the first time at a con, and I really liked it.  The dice rolling (and re-rolling) make it an interesting way to place your "workers" (cubes) to gain points at the end of each round (epoch).  Monument workers stay until the end of the game, where the others are scored at the end of the round. "Flooding the Nile" seems backwards to me.  Seems like it should have been you need to un-flood to get points, and a disaster of flooding should prevent points.  But rules are rules...

RATING: 5
Played once with 4P. Those well-versed in the classic [thing=12][/thing] will find the scoring system of its dice iteration – complete with pharaohs, Nile floods, civilisations and monuments – soothingly familiar. Unfortunately, the Yahtzee-style system used here is a decidedly inferior replacement for the brilliant auction format of the original. 

Not only do the dice grant little control over the areas in which you can score in, but the relatively short epochs also impede making significant inroads in a particular scoring subset. In addition, 4P games feel draggy because you aren't involved in your opponents' turns. This is an average dice game even when considered in its own right, so either get the many other Yahtzee variants out there, or play the original Ra if you have the itch.

It seems like dice game spinoffs are the new card game spinoff.  

All the complexity of Ra (and playtime), but none of the decision making or tension.  The game is filled with a bucketful of obvious moves with only three or four real choices to make (depending on your situation).  There just isn't enough "there" there.  

If it were 10 minutes it would be one thing, but for a near serial solitaire game with a larger rules overhead it just isn't worth the half an hour to 45 minutes that it takes to play.  Feels like a dumber Through the Ages: Dice Game.

I wish there was more of a push your luck thing going on here.  It happens, but it is infrequent. Usually, you are just rolling because you don't have anything to use.  It just isn't granular enough.  

Ultimately, there are just too many other better dice game out there. Why would I play this over Sharp Shooters or Can't Stop? And why would someone that liked Ra want to play this instead?

Keltis and its offspring as well as Medici v Strozzi exemplify Knizia designing excellent variations on classic games.  Ra is one of my all-time favorites and I love dice games, so I was quite disappointed in this one.  The fun of Ra, mainly from the auctions, doesn't translate.  You still have the luck factor, but without that delicate balance of luck and strategy you're left with a confusing exercise in dice rolling and not nearly enough satisfying decisions.  It plays in close to the same time as the original, so there's no reason to play this one.  It's not in the same universe as Ra.

I'm amazed how Knizia can take the scoring system from one of his best games, apply a different mechanism to it and again end up with a very interesting game. Although this uses dice instead of tiles, it's again about risk management and evaluating your position versus those of others. There's defenitely less to it than to the original, but it's still a great game. To bad it's so expensive.

This is probably one of the better-designed Yahtzee-style dice games around, but I'm only guessing since my only experience so far is with 2 players, and I think this game would be much more interesting with 3 or 4.  However they dropped the ball a bit with the physical production; the board was fairly warped and for a dice game, some larger, chunkier dice would have been much more satisfying.  A decent enough game overall, and one that I would certainly prefer playing over the original Ra.  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 2/5  Total: 5.5/10

[RGG 09 edition] {Egypt; dice-rolling; optimal 4p} As a fan of Knizia and dice game, I find it hard to resist this one. I pre-ordered this even before the rules are published.

Yet, it turns out to be a decent dice game.  It has the attributes of a good dice game: fun, fast, interactive and meaningful decisions.  It is fun because it's full of surprises.  It is fast because players only roll 3 times per turn.  There are player interactions in competition of monuments, Pharaoh and in the disasters.  Players have to choose wisely which area should be developed to take good score (monument, civilization, sailing etc.), or press their luck to shoot for disaster to hurt fellow players.  Nonetheless, it is still a dice game and luck is quite strong; sometime, decisions are forced with given dice.  But, with many dice rolls and 3 rounds of scoring, one doesn't need only luck to win.

The components are excellent.  The custom dice are colorful, sturdy and nicely crafted. The game board is effective and the player aids are handy.  The rules are clear and easy to understand.

Scoring from Ra, dice rolls (& re-rolls) from Yahtzee. This works really well - you’re always competing with other players.

I do wish the yellow die was a bit easier to read, though.

Initially thought this captured the feel of Ra in a shorter play time and 2 player friendly game. However, we just find the decisions a bit dull and algorithmic after a few plays. Lacks the tension and replayability of the original classic.

Quick and simple with several interesting dice choices to make, though its mostly a luck-heavy game. Doesn't feel quite like 'push your luck'. Plays NOTHING like Ra; just scores like it. An excellent "quick game over dinner" game.

Purchased from Game Surplus 8/14/09

This game is a 7 if I'm playing with 4 players and probably about an 8.5 for a 2-player game.  The speed of the 2-player game is awesome.


*********EDIT*********

I've bumped up to a 10.  I love this game with any number of players.  It's quick and violent with 2 players and changes a lot as the player number grows.  The game becomes strategic and the focus changes to long term planning.  It works great with any number of players and generally plays pretty quickly.  I love this game.

Surprised by this one... thought it would be a simple version of Ra, but is in fact it's just a different version. There's still a bunch of complexity, and a million ways to win. The civilisations don't translate well though... seems way to hard to invest in, especially when you lose them each turn.

It's like Ra, but without the cool parts. Huge letdown.

What this game missed the most for me, is a way to manipulate the dice.

In my one game I had, on average, 2 suns per turn. That doesn't leave you with a whole lot of options. Guess what, no one else had that many suns on average, and I lost miserably.

RATING: 7
A nice and quick game that to some degree replicates the feeling of playing RA but replaces the strategy of the auctions with dice rolling - the only real strategy becomes whether or not to re-roll to try and advance a different track, and what Monuments to claim, as once claimed they cannot be claimed by anyone else.

I like it, but I can see why others would not.

This is a terrific dice adaptation of Ra. Since our game group has a nubmer of big Ra fans, the dice version easily could have fallen flat. Instead, it seems to have won everyone over. The game retains some of the tension and familiar mechanics of Ra, but plays more quickly and has a bit of a higher luck factor. If anything, the game often can seem to end too quickly. It's quick, colorful and has great graphics. This is definitely a game I can envision playing quite a bit more of in the months ahead.

Ra: The Dice Game swaps candy-colored dice for the original auctions, but leaves most of the labrythine scoring intact.  The result has more action and doesn't feel as mathy, but there's not much left to the game after removing the exhausting price/benefit valuations.  It's like a bomb went off inside the original game, but the crispy shell that remains is still a reasonable snack.

I only had a couple of two-player games so far. it plays fast and it is very pleasant. Setup and teardown are minimal, which is definitely a plus. While I have a feeling that it is a niche game and that it will see little table time, I will never say no to it.

I had one 3-player and one 4-player game, and scales remarkably well. Upgraded my rating to 7.5.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I like this for a very light, filler game. But mostly, I use it as a teaching tool for my nieces and nephews. It teaches the concepts of multiple scoring mechanisms, pressing your luck, balanced civ advancement, and also familiarizes them with a few critical euro mechanics and terms that will help them learn meatier games in the future (i.e. civilizations and civ advancement, monuments and monument building, etc.). I find it very easy to hook the little ones with a dice game. Every moment is exciting for them.

As a side note, this game has been compared to Roll Through the Ages quite a bit, and while they're both great games, I prefer Ra: Dice because I feel more interaction with the other players. In RTtA, I feel like I'm playing multiple-player solitaire. I always prefer interaction in gaming.

I really enjoy [gameid=12], but [gameid=35503] retains only the theme and collection element from the original game, removing the auction element (and most of the catastrophes as well).  Deciding when to call "Ra" and how to respond when other players do is the juiciest part of the original game.  Not much is left when you take that out.  To paraphrase [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/user/MisterCranky] MisterCranky[/url], Welcome to Rahtzee!

I played the prototype once, played twice since the game was released, and don't know that I'll be playing again.  On top of feeling like a Yahtzee clone, the epochs feel much too short, so you never seem to get anything going, and we've only had one catastrophe in three plays.

RATING: 4
Let's get the last of the trifecta of bad new-to-me games in October out of the way now, thankfully due to the way the alphabet works out here. Ra is absolutely fantastic. It's in my personal Top 20 games of all-time and is my Game of the Year for 1999. But I like Tigris & Euphrates a lot too and that doesn't mean I need a card or dice game version of it. The same goes for Samurai, Settlers of Catan, Carcassonne, Puerto Rico, Ticket to Ride, Caylus, and Alhambra. So you can see that my dislike of Ra: The Dice Game is not objective in any way, shape, or form, but obviously stems from a deep-rooted prejudice against all such abominations. I want to play board games, not the stripped down, streamlined, neutered versions of those board games. I completely appreciate the fact that designers and publishers want to make money off of known entities with expansions and spin-offs, rather than risking an investment in an unknown entity, just as we see with sequels and spin-offs in movies, books, and television. That's a perfectly rational approach for the designers and publishers to take, but it doesn't mean I have to like the products that result. That being said, I went in to the game of Ra: The Dice Game with as open a mind as I could muster. However, the game faced an uphill battle from the start given my dislike of earlier German-style dice game efforts, such as To Court the King and Airships, both of which had me feeling bored and helpless. Now those two duds no longer have to stand at the top of the heap as they've been dethroned by the newest dice game abomination. Combining the wonderfully eccentric scoring system of Ra with a dice game that attempts to simplify and streamline is nonsensical. You end up with a game that takes just as long as Ra to play, but still manages to inject mundane dice rolling and strip out engaging auctions. You end up with a game that really should not and would not exist in a world where games were designed to be played rather than simply purchased.

I've always enjoyed dice games.  This uses dice to re-implement many of the ideas originally found in Ra.  Thus it feels somewhat familiar but at the same time plays utterly differently.  Quite an enjoyable game, it plays quick and is a nice change from the original version of Ra.  Overall I prefer the original but would gladly play this again.

RATING: 4
This isn't a bad game, but I just don't see any reason to ever play it. It takes RA and replaces the auction with Yahtzee. I don't mind Yahtzee, but auctions are just much much more interesting. The fact that RA: The Dice Game is only slightly shorter and equally complex as RA is the real downfall of this game- why play this instead of RA? Or alternatively why play this instead of one of Reiner's other shorter Yahtzee-esque games such as Pickomino or Sushizock?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Amazingly, this game translates the standard Ra game into something very familiar, without taking away any of the tension.  True, there are elements of the game that are hard to replace (the ability to make larger sets of tiles, and the whole bidding process and how good players can manipulate it), but the different colors of the dice, and the restrictions on using the wild sides, make up for those absences.  It seems weird that the dice game takes a bit more time than the standard game, but maybe with experienced players, the time drops.  So far, though, I like it, though I have to say that it is definitely not as interesting a game with 2 players.

Quick (and fun!) game that takes the Ra scoring system and uses Yahtzee dice mechanics instead of auctions.  Interesting twist - longevity will depend on whether it feels random but actually is well controlled or whether it just ends up being mostly random.

Yellow dice with white printing = reading fail.

Using colour to determine which civ/monuments you can take is a pretty neat mechanic though.

After a long while I played i again and i still like it: fast, fun, a lot of luck of course but very entertaining. Raised the rating a little bit

----------------------------
The rules seem too complicated at first, even if u already know RA. After a (very) few turns everything is clear and you feel at home. Of course this is a dice fest and extremely luck dependant so keep away from this game if you don't like this aspect.
It's quite fast and with very good rhytm, scoring doesnt take too long and you can decide which "strategy" to follow since you can't get points from everything.
All in all, a decent filler.
Yes, of course, RA is much better, but i like to have lighter games with some brain in it, from time to time.

I have mixed feelings about this game. It feels a bit like Aton with more randomness and dice. You get to pick from several different scoring paths with different characteristics.

Coffee-shop notes: Works, but just fits on a small table. It will go into at least occassional rotation for this purpose. My wife found the theme to be distracting because it was so disconnected from the actions/scoring.

RATING: 1
It's luck squared! The original Ra Factor - where each marginal tile pulled will help/hurt someone and you can never predict how - is back, now with dice. Amusingly enough, it's actually a bit less random because the process for allocating your dice is the same for each person and is very clear-cut. If you roll monuments, try for just one a turn, and always select the same column. (5 dice = 16 points.) If you roll 2+ civ, try for the third; otherwise, reroll them. If you roll nile terrain, increase your holdings to around five, then use the same process as civ dice to try for floods and additional terrain. Pharaohs is an arms race you might as well avoid unless you can snatch first easily and near the round's end. The worst mechanic is probably the Ra tile replacement; every die represents an asset, except Ra symbols. You roll more of them, you get fewer assets. 3 for three points isn't worth it, unless you are fortunate enough to obtain a fourth. meaning you get to specifically MANUALLY TARGET a disaster against your opponents, which is usually game-breaking against either monuments or floods. It's even without the flavor, which is now just empty grids on the board with vague symbology. Roll dice, make obvious choices about allocating or rerolling them. It's Ra the simplistic and streamlined bidding game sans the bidding aspect. What does that tell you?

it's fun, it's dice, it's very chaotic.  it manages to boil down the gameplay of Ra into a pretty good dice game.  All the scoring rules are there, and the civ building choices.

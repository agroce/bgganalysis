An okay 2P game. The game does not have any connection with the story. You are going to solve a case. It's a strategy game of set collection and worker placement. After three games, we understood the mechanics. Will play again and keep in my collection since we like Sherlock Holmes theme.

Theme feels very pasted on, and game play is, dare I say, boring. very lackluster. Would play again if asked, but would not reach for it whatsoever.

Worker placement and set collection.  Workers are placed on cards representing characters from Conan Doyle's stories.  Each offers an action that relates to drawing evidence cards or magnifying glasses (the game's currency).  It is somehow odd that, as in our game, neither Holmes nor Mycroft may appear. The object is to collect more evidence cards than your opponent in a variety of values.  You score vps equal to card value minus the number held by your opponent.  The game plays OK but there is really nothing new or compelling here.

A new offering on the Kosmos 2-player series, Holmes is a neat little game of worker placement and set collection.
It lasts 7 turns, and each player performs only 3 actions per turn, so it plays quickly.
It is a light, but quite interesting, back and forth of actions with a bit of interplay variance due to the random placement of characters.

Not bad, willing to play again to see if it can keep my interest. Initial tentative rating is a 7.

Initial Impressions:
--------------------------
A neat 2p worker placement / set collection game.  Not sure the theme really comes out, but the artwork and overall components are fantastic.  The rule book is awful, so make sure you read the rules questions here on the geek since there are some important rules questions that are not addressed in the rules.  I do really like how every game will feel different just by the fact that one character won't be in the game, and that the order there characters will come out will change every game.

My wife really digs this, but I think we both think that the cards and the placement of workers are a little too restrictive, so my rating has fallen a bit. I really like it's a tough puzzle... but I'm not sure it won't fizzle out for us after a while. More data required.

Un filler sencillo para introducir en la mecánica de colocación de trabajadores y set-collection. Es interesante pero me da la sensación que en muchas ocasiones hay pocas opciones ya que la jugada a realizar está muy clara, aún así, para 20-30 minutos hace el apaño. Supongo que con dos jugadores expertos habrá mucho más estrategia/táctica por detrás. Quizás mejoraría con una regla de la casa que cada jugador empiece con dos/tres cartas boca abajo y así poder jugar con algo de incertidumbre.

Fun little two player game. Takes a little time to teach what the character cards do, which is a bummer for how quick the game plays.

RATING: 5
TRADED IT! (for Greed)

In practice this is a great mini game about optimizing choices, but sadly the choices each round are quite obvious. The scoring sounds very interesting, but also tends to fail, since in a 2 player game, picking a card to add +1 to your score amounts to the same as picking a card to subtract -1 from your opponent's score.

Still, it is pleasant enough to try once or twice, just not deep enough beyond that.

This is a cool game, like the worker placement with the set collection, but WOW is the theme bad. You could have put any theme with this. It could be about drug running from Mexico to the US, each character could be a DEA agent on your payroll, drug runners, hidden shipments, etc and it wouldn't change the game play at all!

That being said, it still is a fun game to play.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (April 2017)

We love Sherlock Holmes so my SO and I were very keen to play Holmes: Sherlock & Mycroft. It ended up disappointing us.

The rules of the game are easy to teach, you can do it under 5 minutes. Playtime is fast, around 25 minutes.

The art of the game is ok as are the components. 

Cool theme obviously ;), but you don’t feel it thought the game :(. It is pasted on.

The idea of the game is clever, each day for seven days, one new person appears and you can ask for their help. This mechanism keeps the game fresh as every game will be different but the decisions needed to play the game aren’t very hard, in fact, they are kind of obvious, that is, you often know what is the best play without thinking too much.  Also, as your meeple doesn’t block your opponent´s, both players can have the same 3 actions every turn if they so desire it :/. In short, what you opponent does has a very low effect on you.

The luck of the draw is considerable. You know how many cards are of each kind, but that’s not enough to control the luck. Sometimes you will pick some cards and then your opponent can benefit a lot from the new cards. This is the deal breaker for me, I heavily dislike this aspect of the game, at least it plays fast.

The scoring system is interesting and the only redeeming aspect of the game. 

Holmes: Sherlock & Mycroft wasn’t exciting in any way and I was expecting at least a little bit of deduction as any game with Sherlock´s name on it would imply. As deduction is my favorite game mechanism right now, I’m disappointed by this as well .There is no deduction whatsoever in the game. 

Bottom line, Holmes: Sherlock & Mycroft is much lighter than I was expecting. The luck of the draw is very high and I feel it will decide the winner of the match, pure tactics. The decisions needed to play the game are mostly obvious. I already sold my copy of the game. It can be a good game for casual players but it is not for us. I only played the basic version of the game, but my desire to play it again is very low, so I won’t play with the villains. Disappointing game.

First game played by two novices.  Found the game slow to start because the rules were not quite clear enough about the proceedings of the first round.  Once we got into the hang of it, the game continued smoothly.

The game does not really answer the thematic question of whether the accused was guilty or innocent.  Rather, it is a race for victory points.  The goal is to amass the most clues worth the most points.  Sub-rules provide for deductions based on your opponent's collection.  The means of collecting clues is twofold -- by collecting investigation points which are exchanged for clues, or through the use of characters which provide clues through direct acquisition or exchange.  The Holmes vs. Holmes theme is not essential to the play of the game.  It is just window dressing to the actual mechanics of play.

The game is good, the interaction of the cards and the "worker" placement, collecting sets and trying to be the one to score the most from them.

The theme doesn't work for me though.  I think I saw somebody suggest somewhere that competing South American drug cartels would work better (changing the card suits and characters of course).  The I collection more magnifying glasses and shoes means that the laborer is innocent just does jell for me.

I really cannot understand why people are raving about this; the theme is non-existent, and serves only to sucker people into playing a very dull worker placement game that's so in love with its mechanics that it doesn't bother to explain any of them in a player aid, instead choosing to have a poorly-written rulebook throw them at you.

Still, at least the art's nice.

Although the setting is appealing, the play and theme seem to have a disconnect; the goal is to prove a particular outcome (guilty/innocent) rather than to discover the Holmesian truth. In fact, this shouldn't be an issue because the theme is a VERY thin veneer indeed and it's really just a pedestrian 2-player set collecting game that failed to excite either of us. I'll give it another try with the extra cards to see whether it improves (or whether it improves when you ignore the theme).

I found this game for sale on the last night of Dice tower CON 2016.  I had interest in this game since the Dice Tower review in May, but could not find it retail.  So happy I finally did.  The gameplay is great and is a lot of strategy in a smaller box game.  The tug of war over card majority comes across well and the worker placement actions and mechanisms give you something to think about.  This game may be a surprise hit for me in 2016.

Good worker placement, set collection game with a good timeframe (20-30 minutes). If you can go beyond the fact that there are no real deduction and that the Sherlock Holmes theme is pretty much pasted on, this is quite an enjoyable game.

RATING: 3
Set collection without any connection to the theme. 

Feels unsatisfactory in multiple ways: Most of the time you don't want to choose any of the actions because they would directly benefit the other player, and there is no way of changing the player order. The order in which you choose the actions matters very little because there is no real cost of choosing the same action as the other player. All cards are worth one point, except for maps which you just have to fight for. Getting a complete set of one point cards gives a bonus but that can easily be taken away by the stealing action. Only one sensible way of possibly getting a useful face down card, meaning you can't really protect yourself from stealing, and not much room for bluffing either. The game might be slightly better when using the Holmes/Mycroft card but I have no interest in trying again.

This was fun, more than I had expected. It feels like Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small: Sherlock Holmes Edition. Simple enough set-collecting scoring overlay, but it's a clever one. I pimped out my worker meeples from MeepleSource. It's the little things...

[b]Holmes: Sherlock and Mycroft[/b] was traded away in a math trade 2/11/18. (Received Lost Valley: The Yukon Goldrush 1896)

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (4):[/COLOR]

[i]I was really excited to play Holmes: Sherlock and Mycroft because it combined set collection and worker placement, two game mechanisms I really enjoy. Unfortunately the game was total flop due to the extremely straightforward decisions you make throughout the game. The different character powers are extremely similar and not all that exciting. Holmes: Sherlock and Mycroft has the beginnings of a great game, but fails to create any excitement while playing because it is so simple. On top of that the random draw of characters can really hamper the game; several characters were never used based on when they were revealed and their powers being next to useless or too expensive. And based on how the game works I don't think this would be an isolated event. I don't usually write off a game after one play, especially if it plays quickly and has mechanisms and a theme I typically enjoy, but I can't bring myself to play this again.[/i]

Happy to have a Sherlock Holmes themed game in my collection, that isn't a deduction game! The worker placement and set collection in this game work great together. I enjoy seeing one new character each round. Always slightly different game play with cards coming out in a different order each game. Exhausting a card (aka, out for one round) when both players visit it is also a neat mechanic. Nice choice of actions from the characters. You have to balance when to take cards to give yourself points, and when to take them to deny your opponent the points. Very nice game. And also love the art style of the cards.

This is a solid design, but it became samey for me after a few games. It is a set collection at heart with some workerplacement mechanic. This mechanic works fine, but the characters that get played out feel very samey. I don't think I will be pulling this out myself, but will play it when asked to.

Another 2p only game. This is really tug of war and reminded me a lot of [thing=174192][/thing]. Riley informed me it was the same company who published both games. Makes sense. You are working the board moving meeples around trying to collect sets of cards to have majority in the sets and score the points. I was super underwhelmed with this game. It is a beautiful game and has some fun points. I did enjoy it more than  Banjooli Xeet which was another game by the designer. I wouldn't mind playing again but I don't really have an urge at this moment to do so.

Jogabilidade interessante, embora algo complexa demais para o estilo de jogo; arte bestial, se bem que há duas personagens bastante parecidas; componentes apelativos, apesar do design de produção ter uma ou outra falha (como a não impressão das 3 cartas permanentes no próprio tabuleiro); e tema bom para o chamariz, mas completamente coladinho, de tal modo que nem cumpre a cativante história do prelúdio. Resultado: Um bom jogo, não muito demorado, com coisas novas, embora a forma de pontuar faça lembrar o "Shanghaien" de Michael Schacht.

A decent game. I like the decisions for needing the currency (magnifying glasses) and wanting the cards that are out on the market. Also, it is a fun balancing act for trying to get majorities, complete sets, map collection, and just minimizing points lost on non-majority sets. I wish more of the day card options that came out were more useful. I feel like they should be better than the default 3 that never get exhausted, but only a couple are. I do feel like most games there would be a big advantage to going last.

Excellent 2 player card game on the same line as Lost Cities. I like that some cards you collect are hidden from your opponent.  End game scoring is always close. The different ways the cards come out changes the feel of the game each time. Artwork and components are great.  Theme is pasted on, which is a bit of a disappointment. Over all very good game.

Holmes: Sherlock & Mycroft is easy to teach, engaging, and fun to play.  I like the action selection mechanism because it’s actually thematic and something different than usually seen in card games (e.g. simultaneous selection and reveal, draw a card/play a card, etc.).  The artwork is nice and really helps to bring the theme alive.  For being a fairly quick game, there are definitely meaningful choices and various strategies.  If you’re looking for a new 2-player game for your collection and you enjoy set collection, then I’d highly recommend trying Holmes: Sherlock & Mycroft.

This is an action-selection set-collection sort of game, with a very-much pasted on theme. The action spaces are characters from the Holmes universe, each with a different effect. There are 3 standard actions always available, the rest being random (2 at start, another added each of the 6 rounds after the first). Players choose 3 different actions each round; any action chosen by both will be unavailable the following round. Actions allow players to gain search tokens (the currency of the game) or use them to acquire cards (either from a display, the deck, or maybe the other player). Cards are kept face up in personal displays, sorted by type; each card comes in a set of size 3-9. At the end, the player with the most of each card type scores the set value (=size of set) less the number of cards of that type which the other player collected. There are a few little twists (some cards face down and protected, optional cards to increase difficulty) but that's the gist, highest sum wins!

Decent, but not nearly as good as my favoirte 2er classic Battle Line!

RATING: 7
[Kosmos 2017 Edition] {Sherlock Holmes; action-drafting, set-collection; 2p} Holmes is a thematic filler for 2p. The characters are from the novel but their functions are disconnected from the novel exclude those good guys help you, and bad guys hurt you.

Players compete to collect clue cards with investigation tokens (currency) in hand.  Players have 3 actions each turn and then they select an available character action in 7 days (rounds).  The replayability comes on the show up order of character cards.  Some character cards allow you to exchange or steal clue cards from the opponent.  If a character is used by both players, it is not a available next round.

The scoring twist is the different of a clue between player or you monopolize a clue.  The game is interactive. Certain luck is here with the draw of clue cards - but you can manipulate the clue deck with character cards.

I am glad I have the German edition.  The characters of this edition is more fun.

The card illustration is as good as other Kosmos games.  It does help the game experience.  However, the iconography is not intuitive.

The optional character cards are funny.   They shall be used each game.

RATING: 7
Pre-release demo game with final components.

A nice little card set collecting game. 7 rounds of 3 actions where available actions increase each round. Cards have values 3-9 and whoever ends up with most cards of a value scores the face value minus one point for each of those cards held by the other player.

We encountered a situation not covered in the rules (or we couldn't find it). We ran out of draw cards one turn before the end of the game, and had no discards to re-use - mainly because the actions creating discards were the last two to appear.

I was told it'll be released in November 2015, at €20. I'll certainly pick up a copy when I can.

Fun worker placement games with Sherlock theme. If you squint, the theme is there and enjoyable. Eg: I'm going to see inspector Lestrade and gather some clues from him. The game looks beautiful. Board especially looks good - laid out like a Dr Watson's diary. The characters that populate the board as the game progresses are really nicely drawn. The iconography takes a bit of getting used to! It's a quick game and one I will look forward to playing again.

Had fun playing this; has some similar scoring and set collection to Parade and I really like the 'book' format of the board. Nice artwork, but the magnifying glasses were a bit too much- they are a bit awkward to hold and more and don't make much thematic sense. The meeple movement was also counter-intuitive. Going to keep this around for a few more plays to see if it feels to 'same-y' after a while.

Having seen a quick review about six months ago, I thought this would be a great game for my wife, who loves Sherlock Holmes stories.  

While on a trip to Spain in March 2016, we found a Spanish copy in Jugar x Jugar in Barcelona, so we snagged it.  Luckily, my wife is a native Spanish speaker, so we could get through the rules.

It's a light, worker placement/set collection game, and has become one of my wife's new favorites.  The random set up with the special characters can, sometimes, have powers that don't really come into effect, as they are much more powerful earlier in the game.  

My wife enjoys the game so much, that she purchased the upgrade kit from Meeple Source, that has the Sherlock and Mycroft meeples, along with little magnifying glass tokens.  There were some odd choices in the game's production, the large magnifying punchouts and the blue and orange meeples.  Now that we have the upgrade kit, I suppose we'll be playing even more.

[thing=174078][/thing]  is a set collection mixed with worker placement, really well knitted and filled with decisions and options. I enjoyed the pacing and the interactions between the different characters, alongside with the random order in which they appear.

There is a fine dose of luck present, sure, still, usually the best use of the characters will make a bigger difference. [thing=174078][/thing] has a good amount of variety, both due to the random nature of the draw deck of the clues, as well as in the order the characters appear at the start of the rounds - also, one of them remains out, and there is the possibility of using Sherlock and Mycroft.

Overall, [thing=174078][/thing] is a game that surprised me: I am not a fan of competitive 2 players games, yet this one pleased me with its easy gameplay, relevant choices, replay value and interactions - not even the fact that the game is basically without true theme bothered me much. Approved.

Fun and easy two player worker placement/resource management/set collection game. Plays fast and is easy to both teach and learn. A little "take that" with some of the cards. I like how two games are never the same with the cards being variable. The theme is one I enjoy though I don't feel the theme is relevant to the game at all. The art and components are good. Some cards coming out either late or early can essentially make a card/worker spot useless. Still a very fun game overall.

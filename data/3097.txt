Poor, mean, and aggressive.  Somehow capital in painfully tight even though capitalization is incremental at the current stock price, though the game is quite variable based on the company order.

1/3/17: Sicily.  Less replayability than other titles.  Hasn't been played locally in 10 years.  The experienced local players are not likely to pull this out, but J.C. Lawrence (clearclaw) and the bay area group likes it.

A very good, low player count variant of 18xx. Plays well with 3, also great with 4 and the different scenarios keep it tight with either count. Can't imagine what it would be like with 5...

Corporation share control and emission is an interesting mechanic, although it doesn't go to the same lengths of 1841, and I feel it is the key to this game - knowing when to emit shares, when to buy them back, and trying to control the amount in the treasury is crucial.

The most striking feature of the game is how tight money can be, and how much you have to pay to do anything - tokens are paid upfront, trains are expensive, inneficient and rust early, construction costs are horrible, and the best way to minimize them ensures your trains won't run very far.

Another big difference is in the map. Some cities absolutely dominate in terms of income (particularly Palermo), which significantly affects the dynamics of track planning to a much greater extent than most other games. 

In the end, I think money is tight, but not too much of a concern - the fact that treasury shares pay into the company can be an important revenue stream, and some cities give such high revenues that simply having access to them ensures a good run, even if the rest of the route is poor. In fact, I've managed to get through a (admitedly lucky) game where I don't think I had to do a single withold. It also leads to the funny situation that you don't always want to have the best company at start - if it's too atractive, its shares will be bought out too fast. 

All this means the game is very cutthroat, and a mistake can prove disastrous. However, I've also seen a player recover from what seemed a hopeless position to finish solidly in the middle of the pack, though his crash did contribute to the winner running away with the game.

All in all, a good game when you're in the mood for blood, as one of my gamemates put it once. Just play carefully and with plenty of patience...

Because of the map the play can be kind of predicatable but the rules allowing for random companies to be removed depending on the number of players keep the game interesting.  I'm always willing to play if someone suggests this one.

RATING: 7
Even though it’s not the kind of game I love, I enjoyed playing 1849: I expected a boring game about railways, where you put down tiles and try to optimize your never-adequate resorces by playing on your own and as such I wasn’t too excited at the idea of losing a whole afternoon reckoning the gains of shifting random wodden cubes here or there.

On the contrary, I competed for survival in a heavily interactive and deadly game, where no actual fight is allowed but blows under the belt are plenty: in fact, as glued on as it is, its railways theme is purely incidental, as it only inspires and justifies the companies’ stocks ups and downs, thus the revenues at the of each turn. As a matter of fact, it’s a financial game and, as anyone familiar with Trading Places should know, finance is an an even more deadly environment than any other: «Nothing you have ever experienced will prepare you for the absolute carnage you are about to witness».

Nonetheless, I can’t see me playing this brain burner again too soon: it’s just too heavy and exhausting for my taste.

Brilliant version, it's a damn shame that it's so hard to find. Incredibly replayable, and quite deep. Players suffer like hell in this one, it's a struggle to buy the 3rd level train (which isn't even permanent).

RATING: 4
It's a frustrating game where players are punished by the game rather than the players and players never have the money to do what they want/need to.  The frustration level means it doesn't get played often, but I keep it for when my masochistic side is out.  

Interesting features: 
1. hex trains
2. only 4 trains of the 4H and 6H (yellow/green) followed by three 8H (rust 4h) and (I think) two 10H (rust 6H) and one 12H followed by 16H (rust 8H) and E trains.  
3. most of the terrain is expensive (up to $160) and upgrades include original terrain costs.
4. option for one large loan ($500) per company with 10% interest per round.
5. companies start in a fixed (randomized) order.

RATING: 9
A clean and tightly focused addition to the 18xx canon. The randomised, but then fixed, order in which the corporations are sold gives each game a new edge, simultaneously limiting options while creating a new landscape. Cleverly done.

The land is rugged and there is complexity in the track-laying (with multiple guages). But, but, but. The financial subtleties are there in spades. You can sell stock direct to the bank pool to capitalise your company, deflate the price and buy the lower price stock back. You can issue bonds for an instant 500L hit. You can find new ways to bankrupt yourself.

There can be cat and mouse and then an incendiary train rush. There's a wonderful tempo, great decision making and scope for creativity. Top tier design.

RATING: 9.5
1849 is Sicily.  Sicily is poor.  So are its railroads and so are its players.  Making money on Sicily is like pulling hen's teeth.  Once you find the teeth, which isn't easy, actually pulling them requires fits of genius unknown to man.  That's probably because the teeth, like the money, doesn't exist.  Instead the companies concentrate on taking money from the players.  Then the volcano blows up.  Scores are low in Sicily.

1849 is fundamentally vampiric.  It wants to suck you and all the other players dry and dead as dust.  Bankruptcies do not end the game.  The train progression is relentless and the (hex) trains are never quite long enough or cheap enough.  The oppression is constant.  The drains on capital and control are immense.  The game requires constant and unflinching vigilance and accurate play.  One blink or even just the thought of a blink and the game will be lost. 

Update (2012): Rating raised from 9.0 to 9.5 explicitly for the 3-player game.  1849 is the clear output of an enormously skilled game designer.

One of the worst 18xx games.  Forced train company purchased order, too limited of funds for companies to make interesting decisions.  Plodding, slow and dull in comparison to the other 18xx games.  I can't recommend this to any but the most die hard 18xx fan or someone who likes games with few options and slow pacing.

Could be sub-titled: 1830 - The Mountain Game. An excellent mini-18xx game with the McGuffin being that the companies are offered in a fixed sequence that is decided randomly at the start of the game. This design is an object lesson in offering interesting Private Companies, the essential ones depending on which company you'll be running (and of course you won't know that until the auction is over). Compare that with the boring Privates in 1861 for instance. Any of the public companies can be excellent, depending on the start order and getting the right private. My only complaint is that with just 6 companies some players will only get one and that reduces their interest quite a lot. An outstanding game for the playing time.

Making money in this game is like pulling teeth, but so rewarding.  The Akragas probably should not be used in Scenario 5, unless it is house ruled to the bottom of the stack.  Cheap permanent (R6H) trains are a curse and a blessing- timing is everything in this game.  Track mix is BRUTAL with only one tile of many of the upgrades available.  There's just as much game here as 1841 without the rules overhead, and I can see this easily going to a 9 or 10 with me.

There's nothing about an 18xx game that provides me any form of enjoyment, and so the prospect of spending another three hours(at minimum) per session at least half a dozen more times just to progress past the conscious incompetence stage is unappealing. The strategies and tactics of this genre will forever remain opaque to me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A game that hates you. You, personally. Expensive hex-trains, expensive terrain, expensive tokens that you absolutely have to pay for, incremental capitalisation, expensive private companies, and a fixed order to the companies so that the one that's up next is absolutely terrible. That the second-best city in the game gets destroyed two-thirds of the way through (reset to yellow, remove any tokens from the game) is almost irrelevant, one tiny additional "screw you."

Shame about the myriad tiny errors that crept into AAG's production, and also a shame that they went with their own unclear graphic design instead of building off of Deep Thought's groundbreaking work.

Quite good.  I like incremental funding in 18xx, it just makes sense to me.  I like how the chrome doesn't get in the way in this game.  I also like the small map.  I've only played once, but I can see how the variable sequence of which companies will start and follow will add some nice differences to each game.

Varied, logical, not overly stock centric but still dynamic. And it plays well with 3 or 4 and plays fast.

The permanent train rush is brutal and fun, but I enjoy the variability of the setup, and thus board development, quite a lot too.

The three player game is great fun, perhaps the best way to play it.

RATING: 10
The two different types of track adds a whole other layer to an already complex system. The game feels new every time because the companies have to be started in a specific order that changes from play to play. Add in the fact that closed companies can be restarted you get a challenging and entertaining game every play.

For an older [b][family=19][/family][/b], [b][thing=3097][/thing][/b] has some interesting things going for it.  The track, standard and narrow, with one of each coming off a yellow city, was quite different to the one other multi-gauged games I've played ([b][thing=1493][/thing][/b]).  The train rush was quite brutal, but the single train type (until the end game) and its use over multiple gauges was simple and elegant.  And unlike some [b][family=19][/family][/b], the game remained interesting from beginning to end - in part because it's a fairly quick game for it's genre.

Pre-ordered a PnP starter kit from Print n Play Productions.

I like this 18xx very much.  Money is tight.  Incremental capitalization, high building costs, double gauges.  Interesting stuff.  The companies must be started in order.  That order is randomized at the start of the game.

The 20% last share also adds some interesting timing decisions.

Sicily (1849 to 1922)  3-5 players, Best with 3-4 

Although dubbed a game-kit, this 18xx offering is of top-notch quality. Lay your track lines and purchase your shares within the entire island of Sicily (1849 to 1922). A more easily managed and quicker game of its type, but with a few different nuances.

Wonderful, really wonderful game. It is a hard game, difficult to play well, unforgiving, where a lot can happen, a lot of terrible things can be done to the fellow players. 

It has all the characteristics that I like in the games of the 18xx series and more. It offers a lot of strategic possibilities and a lot of freedom and possibilities to be creative.

The rules and the design are like a swiss clock, very logical and with beautiful details, but very intuitive at the same time. 

The random sequence of companies on sales guarantee a high replayability: the difficult choices of the beginning are different at each game.

As a further plus it lasts usually less than the average 18xx game.

I think it really shines with three players, but it is also very good in four. Not tried in five, possibly not the best, but not sure.

On BGG there is the possibility to download all materials and build a PnP game. It is worth it.

Very recommended... but not to the faint at heart :)

Excellent small/short 18xx. In 3 player, one of the companies (at random) is not present each game, and those that are are available in a random order, so it plays a bit differently each time.

Companies can dump their own stock into the bank pool to conjure up money for trains/privates, though any stock in the bank pool at the end of a stock round causes stock value to drop.

RATING: 8
Small-scale 18xx with perhaps a bit too few companies, though the fact that companies can buy/sell their own shares compensates a bit of what the game is lacking in train-shuffling. I do not quite like the way almost all tiles and upgrades cost money and the runs for the hex trains are not as easy to see by quick glance (especially due to the two track widths) as regular trains would be, but at least they make the game sufficiently different from the vanilla variants.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I love, love, love the narrow and standard gauge rules! Narrow gauge track takes longer to cross. However, city tiles contain both, which force you to use both! Very, very clever cheapo permanent "reverse" trains available at the end which move fast on narrow gauge but slow on standard.

Having the last certificate worth double made some stock market rounds feel gamey.

Very punishing, tight game. Probably too tight for my tastes. Everything's expensive: trains, terrain (especially terrain; you have to pay full mountain costs even when upgrading). 

Personally, though, I prefer 18xx titles where players often control multiple corporations. I like shifting capital around!

I have enjoyed it each time, although the reaction from others has been mixed.  Low returns and lack of liquidity seem like they increase the length of the game considerably.  Next play I will to try to ride companies into the ground.  My perception is that even flush with funds, a player has limited investment options due to the tight certificate limit.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I still have mixed feelings after three games with 4 and 5 players. I like it but it's not my favorite. Different forced company starting order brings some variance between the games but the track building is mainly the same because a couple of cities are so high valued than the others. Because Palermo is so high valued, it is always better to run twice to Palermo when you have two trains. The south of the island is just too poor to be interesting for anything. IMHO city values are not well balanced. Advanced game is your best bet.

Making money in Sicily is hard.  Building is expensive.  Trains are expensive.  Doing anything is expensive.  This makes for a brutal early game.  

It's a game of running companies well, and I don't typically love that, but this game is interesting because it's so hard on the players.

To date I haven't played 1830, which this game is derived from. Coming from 1860, I found the stock shenanigans intense and intriguing. I love the combination of no par value, incremental capitalization and the ability of the IPO to sell its shares to the bank. Also, track development has the interesting quirk of the different gauges; like everything else in 1849 it works well and feels elegant. Among the shorter, yet arguably the most intriguing and entertaining xx I've played.

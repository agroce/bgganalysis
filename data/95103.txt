GAME: Fortune and Glory: The Cliffhanger Game
RANK: 713

RATING: 5.6
At first glance, I thought I was going to love this. I mean, it looks like Robinson Crusoe. But it is definitely not Robinson Crusoe. Possibly worth another chance under more ideal conditions.

RATING: 1
A very thematic game with immersive story telling features, push your luck mechanics, and 'cliff hangers' (extra dice rolls and blind card draws) - none of which appeal to me. Can't forget to mention the inclusion of the ubiquitous femme fatale tropes with special powers.  People who like Talisman should also enjoy this equally awful game.

Just like Last Night on Earth, Flying Frog Games has made such a strong theme and a mechanic to go with it that each play of the game plays out exactly like a story from the genre.  Great 1920s pulp characters and tasks.

At our last game day, my friend called this "Indiana Jones but we couldn't afford the license."  An apt description indeed.  It has almost everything you could want in a dice-chucking, cliffhanger-flipping, Nazi-fighting, pulpy adventure game.  Almost.

While I always enjoy the game for the crazy narratives created (e.g. a nightclub in Tokyo that is secretly a front for pygmies), and the look and feel of racing around the globe looking for artifacts (enhanced since I painted the miniatures), the game often feels just a bit too long for what it is.  Even playing with only 3 players, our games regularly go 2.5-3 hours.  Now part of this length is that we enjoy reading the cards, hamming it up, and doing silly "find out next time..." voices for cliffhangers.  But even this usually lasts only for about the first 1.5 hours, and then the game keeps going.  I'm not opposed to long games, but all the players need to feel involved the whole time, and while this has happened in our games, there have also been games where everyone gets a bit of a glazed-eye look after 2 hours.  I've been thinking about reducing the amount of fortune needed to win to 12 or even 10 - something high enough that a player will need two artifacts at a minimum, but will hopefully cut a bit of time.  Maybe to increase the challenge with this lower fortune, I would include a vile organization all the time.    

Still, a fun adventure game with buckets of character (and dice!).  Don't expect deep decisions or more than a pulpy (preferably alcohol-fueled) romp with a few friends and you'll find a lot here to like.

A fun romp for some, but I found it all too tedious and rather long.
Some laughs at bad German accents, but too many dice and too much upredictability.
If half the length, could be good for kids.

Seen a lot of plays, only complaint is that sometimes it seems a little easy to win co-op.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I played two games of the co-op: one against the Nazis and once against the mobsters. I enjoyed it. It wasn't that difficult, but the mobsters could have made it really interesting if the temple hadn't collapsed on their leader. But I enjoyed the narrative. You could always make it more difficult by changing the amount of fortune required to win or the number on the track required for victory by the board.
I would like to try to the competitive game, but I think there should be a mechanism that allows the board to win and all players to lose, just to add an added touch of drama.
My rating reflects what I played, but I think with a very slight tweak mentioned above, this thing could be even more intense and go higher. Overall though, it was an enjoyable playing experience.

RATING: 7.4
The basic game takes entirely too long to really enjoy.  Adding in all of the optional game play and advanced rules makes the game enjoyable again.  Even having a player knowing all the rules well still takes a solid hour per person to play this game.  That's also allowing for 30 minutes to set up and review the rules with all the players.  It's a dice fest, but is dripping with theme.  If the players are easy going, then it's a lot of laughs and fun to play. 

As a friend suggested, playing with all the optional rules will speed this game play up and make it even more fun.

RATING: 7
OK, first off, the theme is awesome and FFP really knows how to soak a game in it. Every little detail is there, every card, every tidbit of text, this game screams "theme" every step of the way. Bits are wonderful, as always, with magnificent sculpts, a gorgeous board and the always awesome photo-artwork with actors.

That being said, this game is incredibly fiddly, with lots of exception rules to remember. I had this feeling when I started to play A Touch of Evil (which I've grown to adore), so it may go away with more games under my belt. I think FFP went overboard with the dice rolling aspect, though (rolling dice to see who goes first, then to determine each player's move, then to see if players draw an event, etc). I hope their next game will ease on the bones a bit. This makes you feel a lot less in control of your destiny, which is a definite minus.

So all in all, it's fun, but gameplay can be bogged down by constant dice-throwing and rulebook referencing. Not FFP's best.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I wish I liked F&O more. I like the setting. But the gameplay gets in the way. For one, it's very clunky and slow-moving. The down time is bigger than, say, Eldritch Horror or Agents of SMERSH.  Secondly, the actual card events aren't very thematic at all. I might be creeping into an ancient ruined temple deep in the jungle and encounter... a high speed downtown car chase! Or infiltrate a fancy soiree. 

What?

The game relies on players telling their own stories. Which might be cool, but it also does a lot of things to prevent the players from actually accomplishing said task.

Played first game and had a blast even though it was our "learning from scratch" adventure. We kept it to the basic game and it came down to the wire. Looking forward to the advanced version next. Nice that it doesn't take all night to play. Played the Indiana Jones soundtracks in the background and it added a nice feel to the entire game. This one is screaming for an expansion... especially for additional Danger cards.

RATING: 7
This rating would be higher, because it's a fun game, but for two of our six players being effectively eliminated within two turns, and the game having a clear runaway leader(s) issue.  Those two players finished with two Fortune points COMBINED in spite of making no errors.  That's a real problem.  It wasn't helped by two other players getting lucky early and then being able to buy cards which were going to make the game easier for them, allowing them to easily and quickly extend their lead.  After the first 30 minutes it was clear the game was a race between two player for first, two others for third and the other two for fifth.  That just sucked the fun right out of the game for the next hour and a half.  Hopefully the co-op game is more balanced.

Been very excited about this one and have played solo twice now to get the rules down. Second time was a narrow victory for the Nazis. Rules are a little bit all over the place and confusing in parts but thanks to lots of helpful BGGers and me writing a step by step process guide has helped me nail most of the rules now. Have played several games now with the wife and some friends. Nazis are the favourite villains but it's all good!

Like the other Flying Frog games, it feels like a board game adaptation of the style of movies it tries to capture. Great artwork that really fits the theme well. The rules themselves are fairly simple though the size of the instruction booklet makes it seem otherwise. Not a very difficult game but certainly a fun one for what it is. Soundtrack is pretty forgettable; we had it playing during the first game and every single track is bland and sounds the same.

RATING: 10
First let's deal with the elephant in the room. WHAT IS WITH THAT BOX?! What was Flying Frog thinking? This game could easily have gone into the same size box as A Touch of Evil. Ok. That out of the way ... this game is awesome! It is one of the most thematic games you will find on the market. And yes, it does have a lot of rules and a lot of dice-rolling. But that is what Ameri-thrash (Thank you Zee Garcia for getting that trend started) games are all about. Plus with Flying Frog you get some of the best components money can buy. And on top of all that you get to play at being Indiana Jones! And who doesn't want to do that? It is nice to see that FFP has gotten their rules a bit better flushed out with this game than they did with A Touch of Evil. Speaking of which, this game and Dark Gothic have gotten us to give ToE another look and we have fallen in love with that game again. But we're talking about this game, right? The rounds play quickly once you have a few games under your belt and you understand the rules.  You have this vast world on the game board to explore. It can be one sided in the competitive game if by luck of the draw three treasures appear with 2 spaces of your opponent's starting location. But the co-op rules are awesome and unlike ToE they don't seem to have been an after thought add in. Have not tried the team play yet but we can see that as being a bit too much to keep up with. What else can we say?
Fortune and Glory, kid. Fortune and Glory.

I'm always impressed with games made by Flying Frog Productions (i.e. - Last Night on Earth, A Touch of Evil). This one has many components and an Indiana Jones type of theme.  It's fun and surprisingly simple.  If we finish it too quickly, we feel that we spent all that time setting up and not getting a full game's worth for all this setup time.  It can be challenging at times, if your dice rolls suck.  Still a good game, though.

A big, dumb, fun dice fest.  You can't get too wrapped up in strategy here - you just have to try to get into the theme.  And the theme is pretty great.

undoubtedly the best game i've played all year. The only reason i gave a 9/10 is that there's a complex learning curve to get through before it runs smoothly. The artwork and mechanics are brilliant, the enemies are awesome, player interaction is fantastic. Whether playing competitive, cooperative or a mix of both, the game always seems to be perfectly balanced.

Another Flying Frog game which provides loads of fun but perhaps at the expense of a few iffy rules. Pulp adventure circa the Indiana Jones films, and multiple game modes (competitive, teams, coop and solo), lots of content in the one pricey core box but I feel like I'll need the expansions for the added variety. Takes a bit to memorize some of the more specific rules, but definitely has its similarities to A Touch of Evil and Last Night on Earth. Unapologetic, cheesy awesome fun.

RATING: 8
A very good game.  Yes it is dice based, but it is about risk management, and pushing your luck.  The Indiana Jones adventure theme is strong in this one, a great adventure.  I do like the fact that the villains get stronger over time.

Our first game of 5 took about 4 hours.  It felt a little long, but I'm sure that future games will go quicker as we learn better tactics.  Not sure I'd want to play with more than 6.  I think that downtime would become a significant issue.

With the right group of players (and they could be from any point of the spectrum from hard-core to non-gamers) this is a blast from start to finish. Another wonderful homage to a film genre from this company. The price may be a challenge to some, but I think it will see plenty of table-time in my home and surely that is better value than a cheaper game that I can't get anyone to try. Also, the components (as others have indicated) are very good quality and should hold up well to repeated use.

Fortune & Glory is an archetypical ameritrash game: buckets of dice to roll, loads of randomness at every corner paired with uninfluent decisions, but also funny events and weird situations like in pulp fiction...

This game is designed for people loving to hum the Indiana Jones theme while flipping cards and rolling dice.

It is definitely not my kind of game, but I can enjoy the ride once in a while, while in the right mood.

Two competitive games with advanced rules and one cooperative game with the advanced elements. It is bit fiddly, some rules are not as clear as they could be. But boy, this game is such a blast to play - especially with the Indiana Jones OST in the background. With 2 players the cooperative game impressed us more than the competitive version. 

Luck is a big factor in this game - nonetheless there are a lot of "push-your-luck"-decisions. 

For now I need more playthroughs to decide if the rating ist too low. :)

FANG is a must buy for every Indiana Jones fan out there - that`s for sure!

It is the prototype of Ameritrash games - you have to be in the right mood to enjoy it. It is a luckfest with great atmosphere. You are ok with that? Buy it.

My first play was pretty fun, but I am finding that one Flying Frog game is not much different from another, save the themes (which are always well done).  They feel like a one-trick pony with some minor variances.  That being said, I think this is one of their better games.  It is fun, but can feel like it drags a bit if the turns don't move quickly enough.  We played to 15 fortune points and the game took 2 hours for 3 1/2 players (one dropped out half way through).  We played a basic version, so the game may be more entertaining with additional villains, temples, etc.

I like Indiana Jones much better. The game fell flat for me and I think the lowest point was falling off a cliff and finding out that I wasn't out of the game!? What? Instead I get to start over in a city and watch everyone else take another turn...yeah!! Can I get you another beer? Some house rules could fix this and may persuade me into playing again. Though I think I would much rather watch the movie instead.

Played in only once, but it just felt flat.  Great big board, not a lot to do.  Too much time rolling and moving, not enough player interaction/adventuring.  Yes, we played it as a cooperative, but still, it shouldn't play like four solo games.  It just didn't feel 'tight' - there weren't a lot of difficult decisions.  The game came down to 'we need this thing, so go over there and roll for it when you get there'.  I was expecting a grand movie cliffhanger experience, but got a stale filmstrip instead.

I only play this game co-op now and that at only 2 or 3 players as the game is at least 45 min. per person. Really like to keep this one under 2 hours. I don't play this competitve as the leader gets pounced on and can lose fortune elongating the game. Co-op's definately the way to go. We always feel a real sense of teamwork and accomplishment when we beat the Villains. Components, rulebook, and theme for this game are wonderful. That initial $100 drop is starting to pay off. Always look forward to another game and we haven't even played against the Mob yet. LOTS of replayability but you absolutely MUST insist on reading the flavor text on the cards and get into it a bit. Ignoring that good stuff really takes away from the game. It's all about the cheesy Noir theme! Live it up!

This game is a mixed bag.  I like the theme and the components.  The gameplay is fun and I do think it fits the theme- although you encounter things that are incongruous to where you are, it's just like a jumping off point to some crazy Indiana Jones adventure.  It is a bit random and largely based on push your luck.  Some problems are that mechanically there's not much here for a game of this size (yes sheer physical size) and length and combined with the aforementioned randomness the game feels bloated for what it is at its core.  Eldritch horror fills the same niche too.

-traded away for Mombasa + Ekö + Ekö 3 small expansions-

Bursting with theme, great artwork.
My minor negative points are the playtime and the little player interaction. I wish the Fortune and Glory experience would last longer.
In most of my games it was over way too soon.
And or the player interaction I wish there was more. Maybe that is the reason or the playtime but sometimes it feels that you want to block your opponent on his road to victory and all you can do is playing some cards that have as little as no effect or simply be quicker than him. But despite these points it's still a very cool game.

This game is humongous, and I can hardly imagine the setup and takedown time with all the cards and tokens and things. Nevertheless, since I'm not into X-Wing or Twilight Imperium, this is the biggest game I would ever consider getting.

RATING: 5
FFP's "A Touch of Evil" with a Raiders of the Lost Ark theme.  Typical 1990's style adventure game: roll to see who goes first, roll to see how far you can move, roll to see if you best the challenge, etc.  Tons of randomness, little control.  Worst of all the challenge deck, which is where 90% of the adventure/theme lies, is so small that you run through the entire deck during the course of the game - and it contains duplicate challenges - so it gets stale quickly.  Great bits, but not worth the $100 MSRP.  It's not a bad game, just a game that I already have several (better) flavors of in my collection (Talisman, Runebound, Arkham Horror).

In terms of fiddliness, this would be much better off as a computer game. However, in terms of decisions and control over the outcome, a computer game would be like watching a series of incoherent cut scenes with hardly any input from the player.

RATING: 8
 I dig it out every summer and watch the Indiana Jones Trilogy. Every expansion, including the small packs of cards only available from Flying Frog, are a must. They all add  to the game.  Once you learn how to play the game you become a master, easily going through rounds knowing exactly what to do in each circumstance that arises. Get the full rulebook from the files section on here and have a small amount of patience for learning through experience.
Do not ply with less than 4 heroes unless you want a large challenge. You will lose often and it won't feel balanced.  3 heroes is not enough to get to artifacts and collect them due to the villains jumping around wherever they want then rolling their dice for successes while you pass each painstaking danger. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
If you have ever wanted to race round the world robbing tombs of ancient artifacts while fighting off evil Nazis then this is definitely the game for you. There's lots of luck and the number of cards can get a little fiddly at times but it never detracts from the fun. Despite being far from a masterpiece of strategic gaming, there are still plenty of decisions to make along the way and even though your best laid plans can come crashing down in a hale of bad dice - who cares? The components are beautiful, the theme is endlessly amusing and regardless of whether you win or lose at the end of the game you'll be able to relive the time you jumped from a burning car as it sped into a ravine or fought your way on to a zepplin to steal the gold bars it was collecting from a secret base in the alps. 
UPDATE - must use team play or co-op if more than 3. The down-time is just too much if you're not invested in the outcome
UPDATE - if you play competitively then must play with 'Treasure Hunters' expansion - more objectives and more opportunity to pick up 'stuff' outside of the adventures

What a blast! The ultimate pulp 'Indiana Jones - style' adventure game! There are certainly parallels with Eldritch Horror, and for some having two similar games like this might be an issue.

There are great stories to be had it seems, although the game is quite a table hog!

The wife's favorite game.  What can I say?

An epic pulp adventure game to the tune of Indiana Jones vs. the nazis; Flying Frog Production's finest (and most expensive!) 'base' game in their catalog.

Great fun.

Two things prevent this from being an all-timer:

* The game is ponderous.  Tons of cards, a table eating game board, 4,237 game bits and bobs... it can be a bit much.

* Like all of Flying Frog's games, an expansion is needed to flesh out and complete the base game.  And at FanG's price point, that might be a bit tough to swallow.

With a lot more theme than substance, this game was actually a huge disappointment in my group. Having played and enjoyed Last Night on Earth, this felt like a big step back in terms of gameplay.

If you like thematic games and 30s and if you are not looking too much on the strategy part, you must have this game. In my opinion, FG is an outstanding game. However, you should consider this game as a thematic and not a strategic game. The background of the game took a lot of inspiration from movies like Indiana Jones or Allan Quatermann, but also from mafia related movies. The point is that the mixture gives a very nice entertainment.
One of the assets of the game is the 4 game modes:
-	The competitive game where all the players are racing to be the first one having 15 fortunes coins. The competitive can also be played with team of players. 
-	The cooperative game where all the players are racing against an evil organization (Mafia or Nazis).
-	The solo game that is also quite interesting to play and can be challenging with the maximum difficulty.
-	The last mode is the competitive game, but including an evil organization, that gives a lot of entertainment with the possibility that no one wins the game…

This is a very good game with a lot of high quality materials, the pace is quite high and the cards (danger, events, enemy…) put you directly in the heart of the game. 
The only weak point appears the game duration for a game including more than 6 players.

Fast, easy and the solo game can be challenging with maximum of difficulty. If you like strategy and do not like random events, forget this game.
I give 8.8 taking into account these comments.
A good way to get away from daily life without too much hassle...

RATING: 3.5
Played once, in competitive mode. Won't play again. 

This game combines elements of game play which I dislike. I do not enjoy dice rolling for outcomes, and I don't like a lot of interactions that result in undermining competitors. There was also too much of an unpredictable race element in this one, where we chased a leader, but with the random placement of things to search for it felt like there were only three of our seven players who had any shot of winning.

Plus, some rules seemed illogical and arbitrary. I mean, who should it take an entire turn to buy something when already in a city? Shouldn't I be able to buy something in 
my home city before I leave... after being forced back there by failure? It is like losing a turn for losing if that is the case.

Plus, the flying frog logo on the money and start token really diminishes the theme in my opinion. That is all this game had going for it, so to mess with that is an epic failure. Oh, and the photographic artwork is awkward and unsettling, not thematic and helpful.

RATING: 8
The rulebook is kind of disorganized, so I highly recommend solo play to get acquainted with the rules before introducing the game to a group. I also recommend that because it works very well as a solitaire game.

So far, it's living up to the hype -- not really my kind of game, mechanically speaking, but a lot of thematic fun nonetheless. I mean, racing Nazi agents (or Mafia hitmen) across the globe, dicing your way through deadly traps to recover priceless artifacts while a sinister zeppelin cruises around dropping off troopers? What's not to love?

UPDATE: Played a co-op game with 5 players (and a 6th joining in halfway through). I doubt I'll play this again with more than 4. It's good fun, but the downtime can be a serious issue -- player turns can take a few seconds or a few minutes. And playing co-op means spending a few minutes on the Villains turn on top of that.

UPDATE: Played another game with 6 players, me being the only one who'd played before. We left out all the advanced/ optional rules except for Temples (no Nazis, Mafia, or Zeppelin this time) and played the Competitive game in 2 teams of 3. Everyone got up to speed fairly quickly and it moved along much better. I look forward to introducing the more advanced and co-op elements to folks with a game under their belts, as all that does add to the fun.

What I'm about to write about Fortune and Glory: The Cliffhanger Game (from now on called FaG) might sound a little grumpier than it would need to, but in these days I don't have very much time for games and when I have to spend these rare occasions where I can play a game with a dud like this, I'm very hard pressed to keep my calm. While I tried to stay open minded when FaG was put on the table, first doubts entered my head when I heard the rules. So, all I would be doing for the next few hours would be rolling some dice, drawing some random events and watching others do the same? Well, this doesn't really sound like fun to me. Once we started playing, my fears became real. All I was doing was rolling a buttload of dice, hoping for the best since nearly everything is controlled by chance. And when it wasn't my turn, all I could do was to sit there, staring at people doing the same thing. FaG is so shallow, that there isn't much to think about when it's not your turn. I have nothing against rolling some dice, but if you go down this design road, at least add some interesting decisions. As it is, FaG could have been a game that could be found on a Geeklist called: "Look at all the games my fourth graders designed".

"But the theme is so great" I hear people say. And I can't say that I understand what they are talking about. Sure, for me theme is the most unnecessary part of a game. Give me some great mechanics and I don't care in which thematic setting we are in. If theme and mechanics work well together, it's great. It makes learning the game so much easier. But if they don't match while the mechanics are still great, I'm totally fine with it. I want a great game and not a fantastic theme. Having said this, I don't even thing that FaG captures it's theme very well. Of course you have all the typical ingredients you would also see in an Indiana Jones movie, but luck puts them together in a random order. You know, I'm here in the jungle trying to get this artifact. Now I'm suddenly in a night club fighting some mobsters? It's just a collection of random stuff thrown together sometimes. It doesn't make thematic sense and once you ignore the thematic nonsense the cards talk about, all that is left is an instruction that tells you how many dice you have to roll to get to the next "thematic event". Fun? At least I don't think so.

After only 1 play, I am surprised to find that I very much enjoyed the game, and I eagerly await another play.  The game literally oozes its theme, but it doesn't feel forced.  We played the co-op version, and even though we lost badly, I still had a great time playing.

Well, I'm going to revise my opinion of this game a little.  I mean, fighting Nazis and looking for treasure is fun, but this game is brutal. There just doesn't seem to be a real chance of actually winning.  Plus, co-ops just ain't good gaming.

Beautifully realized concept with just a few glitches.  Star in your own Adventure movie!  Clever mechanics and some really lovely chrome help hide the fact that the narrative is a bit underdeveloped ("winning" feels a bit anti-climactic).
The choice to use unknown actors/models in the artwork (friends and employees, perhaps?) gives the components a somewhat amateurish quality, although overall the materials are very good - there's a lot in the box for the price.
I look forward to future mods and expansions to build up on the core engine, which is very clean and well thought out but just a tad repetitive.

I haven't been very enamored with FFP's releases in the past few years ... but with this installment, I think they have redeemed themselves somewhat by my books.

After seeing all of the components, I had a sudden realization:  All off FFP's installment are based on the same formula.  That said, nothing "wowed" me with this one, but I do like the theme and gameplay.

Complete dicefest - that said, you need to be aware that sometimes, the rolls just wont end up in your favour, and each play may not be as great as you remembered it.

The situations created by the cards are funny and entertaining as all get out, and the core mechanic of push your luck dice rolling down to explore temples is great fun!

 But!

There are sumpteen pages of rules - bulky for a game where each phase boils down to rolling dice, drawing a card, or some combination of both.  The game was fun the first time I played it, but every other time, I'm usually ready for it to be over after 30 minutes. I think the game might be better if we just played until ten points rather than fifteen.  Heck, make it five. It can drag. 

If I drank beer I'd probably like this game.

Yes, there's a lot of luck involved, and yes, at times Fortune and Glory can unfortunatly be a pain in the neck because the game mechanics are so depended on the chance-factor, leading to some moments where it seems it doesn't matter what you do - the dice decides all outcomes, basically. BUT, the game is still VERY fun! It oozes theme and replayability, and even if the dice hates you, I find the core experience to be interesting and enjoyable. While dice-heavy, there's plenty of strategy to be had, from how a person solves dangers and where and what he or she wants to do. And with all the different variants and different outcomes, this game could more or less be played over and over again without losing it's appeal. The only thing missing in this sense is even more content then you get (and you do get your money's worth, believe me); meaning more dangers, more enemies, more characters, etc. Hoping for an expansion to solve this!

Unfortunately we went through the entire deck of adventure/cliffhangers.  Since this is an integral part of the game we felt that this should have been the biggest deck.

I enjoyed that game but again like LNOE I feel it lacks...something.

It also feels a bit weird that you can spend glory but not fortune! 

Traded in 2013 for Mississippi Queen and Black Rose Expansion.

What a fun game.  Similar to, say, Eldritch Horror, but a lot more forgiving and fun.  The cliffhanger aspect of the adventure tests means that even failing a test is a bit more interesting than EH.

Good campy, pulp fun, would definitely play again.  I wouldn't try with more than 4 as it would tend to increase time between turns.  It is also a bit fiddly as there are a lot of little things, but that didn't bother us much as we went in expecting a better version of a Tales of the Arabian Nights/Eldritch Horror.

I don't want to like this game as much as I do. Breathtakingly fantastic components, thematically brilliant, and incredibly fun to play. There is so much chance in the game, that it's hard to feel like you are able to overly affect your ability to win the game, but you have so much fun getting there that it's hard to complain at all. This is an experience, but it's a helluva a fun one to hav

I love the characters, the danger challenges, acquiring allies and items and fighting the villians! I really like the mechanism of assigning new artifact/temple names and locations using cards.

Wow! Excellent fun. This is probably one of my favorite Cooperative games. But you can play this with a solo variant as well as with player vs player, or even teams against teams. You can fight against the Mob or the Nazi and the Nazi even have a War Zeppelin to drop of army units all around the globe. 

This is quite fun and pretty thematic. There's a lot of luck in the game with dice and stuff but I've always liked that. There's a little strategy in figuring out what you want to do, but the best part is just the fun you have in all the cards available to you... the ride is great.

The 70s called, they want their game mechanics back. There is nothing fun or interesting about this game, it's the most hackneyed immature design you could imagine.

Wow, a lot of miniatures, a wonderful laminated map, great pictorial cards, really a lot of them, but...

Apart from lecturing the events and the weird cliffhanger situations, which I feel could become pretty repetitive after some plays, I saw very little interaction between the players during the co-operative game, and little or nothing at all to do while waiting for your turn.
Would it be a thrill getting lost in a frozen cave in... the Caribbean? Or assaulted by the Yeti in... Mexico?
Never in the game I learned how to make out the difference from Fortune and Glory tokens (blue or gold? which is what?).
After one play I found it extremely boring.
Should be a 4, raised to 5 for the gorgeus components supplied.

I've only played the co-op game, but enjoyed it for what it was. The down time between players, was quite a bit and made for a very long game. Especially with 6 of us. There's also quite a bit of dice rolling, which seemed to detract from the games theme a bit and seemed quite easy to pull off the win. It just didn't have as many tense moments, as I thought a game of this type should.

The game components look nice, but I don't feel there is enough there to justify the price. It's mostly a LOT of cards. Though I still enjoyed playing the game and surely would'nt turn down another game. I can't see spending the money to add this one to my collection.

I'd really like to try playing this game competively and would also be interested in seeing how the solo game plays. Just the fact, that you can play so many different ways is a definite plus.

With all said. It was a fun game and we all had a few laughs and a good time with it.

There are some missed opportunities here. The setting is really atmospheric and the cliffhanger idea is ingenious and highly thematic, but there are small things I would want to change. I would like the game to end in a crescendo with rising stakes and a coherent plot line. Sometimes what you do in a turn just doesn’t make sense and it would be nice to tie the danger cards with the specific icons on the board. Mind that I don’t complain that this is a glorified roll and move with only a few decisions or that it takes a few hours to play. I would be fine with that if it provided a nice story.

Pulp Indiana Jones style adventure game set in the late 1930's. You play as 1 of 8 different heroes exploring temples, searching for powerful artifacts and finding trouble around every corner.

Beautiful game board world map of the 1930's and lots of miniatures and plastic coins representing fortune and glory. Super fun. Expect 2-4 hour games.

luckily I played this with people who enjoyed it, because "3" is being charitable with this game design.  I didn't see a non-obvious decision to be made in 3 hours.  while the theme could be interesting, I think it is memorable for the wrong reasons, like it was funny that me and my partner were knocked out by a charging rhino in a Chinese temple, rather than cool like an Indiana Jones movie.

if it was about an hour and wasn't a $100 game with a 30 page rulebook, it might be acceptable.  as is, it is not.

RATING: 5
This rating and comment only concerns the competitive game.  That being said I don't think the cooperative game will be any better.  

I wanted to like this game, but I don't feel like my choices influenced much of anything.  I'm all for a wild ride, but this was a ride with little tension, excitement, or even any funny stories, just throwing dice, and when you fail, you wait til next turn and throw the same dice again.  Overall I was extremely disappointed with the game. At 5 players it was nearly constant downtime and euro-style player elimination (where you are eliminated from contention early but must keep playing until the end despite having no chance).  I pulled the win out from another player through a last minute zeppelin robbery.... which might have ended the game on an excitingg point, if you didn't have to spend a few turns running "home" to win....  eliminating the thrill of escaping the zeppelin with several turns of bash the leader.  Overall, this is an underdeveloped, overproduced, overhyped roll and move clunker.  If it had come out in 1990-1995 we probably would have thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread, but not in 2010+.  

A couple of more specific gripes:  First, "play immediately" event cards that add to another player's victory conditions.  I drew one of these on the first turn of the game.  At that point, no one is winning so you can't whack the leader.  The person you play it on is stuck playing the whole game knowing EVERY other player needs to make mistakes for him to catch up.  Why is this play immediately? Why isn't there an "OR" with another effect in case you aren't in a good position to play the card?

Second specific gripe:  tons of wasted time, in an already long game.  Maybe OK in the cooperative version where you are invested in other players decisions but not in the competitive game, it was awful.  Why are we rolling dice for random turn order?  Why not just rotate turn order so everyone goes first?  Additionally, with no tie breaker mechanism (which easily could have been whoever went later last turn) you can sit there dicing off and tying for a minute or two.  What a waste of time.  Another time waster was rolling to move when you weren't moving, for a chance to draw an event card.  (I'm hoping we did this wrong)  How about if you aren't moving, you don't get an event card? This generated a lot of wasted time, especially when someone drew a text packed card and all of us got to sit and watch them read it before the next person could roll.  

Third specific gripe:  The game is WAY too easy.  The "cliffhangers" had basically no tension because no one really ever failed.  In a four player game that went well over two hours, a bunch of us failed the danger cards (meaning we had to face a cliffhanger the next turn) but I can only remember one failed cliffhanger, there may have been two.  Low chance to fail equals low tension, equals low stakes, equals not exciting to watch others play and no real meaningful decision on when to stop taking danger cards.  The lack of tension failed to evoke the pulpy adventurer theme.

Fourth specific gripe:  Poor development in regard to the connection of theme to game terms.  For such a thematic game, with great art and pieces, I expected more.  You have fortune and glory points.  One represents money, the other is victory points.  So which one is which?  Well shouldn't fortune be money, since the pieces are gold (as opposed to blue) and fortune is associated with make a fortune, as in cash, gold, loot, et cetera?  No.  Blue glory points are money, and gold fortune points are victory points.  Huh?  You spend blue glory to buy items.  But, Gold victory points are spent to travel.  What?  Several other nonsensical, unthematic rules came up while we played, 

Fifth specific gripe:  Playing time.  Due to the large amount of downtime, it goes kinda slow.  Combine that with a game where a few unlucky movement rolls and or danger card rolls can slow you down, plus the game is a bit stingy with VPs, plus there are a lot of screw the other players cards, and you've got a three hour game that FEELS like it took three hours.  Turn one is not significantly different from turn 6 or 7 or 10- What should I do?  Start a new quest for an artifact or finish the one I'm on.  Which quest is the most efficient?  Well its on the card.  Same not very interesting decision over and over.  For THREE hours.  Our initial play took three due to rules look up, I'm guessing 2 or 2.5 would be more typical.  I don't mind long games; in fact I prefer long games.  However when a game has all the strategic depth of pass the pigs grafted onto a roll and move mechanic, two hours would have been too long, and this took three.

Sixth specific gripe (and this is the BIG one):  NO player interaction.  When I saw the game, and saw competitive rules, I thought, fantastic!  Then I played and found out that the game is basically a multiplayer solitaire- you can't rob other players, can't do anything to stop them from taking actions (even if on the same space, same city, or going after the same artifact!).  Basically your only interaction comes through event cards, which aren't interesting or satisfying and typically just deal 1d6 hits to another player, or drop some nazis in their way, or other such effects.  No actual interaction absent these cards, which feel a little like they were tacked on to force some interaction in the competitive game, which otherwise would be a multiplayer solitaire type exercise.  

Seventh problem (then I'll shut up):  for all the stuff in the box, there isn't as much variability as you would expect.  For the slew of stacks of cards, all the artifacts are more or less the same and nearly all the dangers are basically the same...  they just require different statistics to be used.  Blah, much more boring than expected when the unboxing happened.

It's a blast! 
Battling Nazis & doing stuff Indiana Jones would've done is super great. I wouldn't recommend the game with more than 4 players though, cause otherwise downtime is huge.

I think in the long run i would enjoy drawn artwork more than those pictures. The fotos are really nice, but somehow they can kill the make-believe..

Combat-savvy characters seem to have a disproportionate advantage over other characters.

But the real question is: Will the fun last?

Because with being THE most ameritrash game i know of, chances are you might get tired of its lack of strategy & lucky nature.
But maybe pulling this out once in a while just for goofy fun is exactly what it was made for.. :)

RATING: 7
One of few adventure games where you have the feeling of being Indiana Jones in the pursue of treasures and, of course, fortune and glory. This game has the worst mechanic that exist, which it doesn't mean that it is not used in more games: movement controlled by dice. I hate that system. It doesn't make any sense. Please, let me use the strategy that I want to use and if yours is better than mine, you win, not that you win because you have rolled better numbers and you have got there before I have. The mechanic impact has been reduced by allowing cards drawing when rolling a 1 but, nonetheless, a 1 is a 1, you haven't moved a sh****. The whole game can be considered a dice-rolling-frenzy. You roll for everything, highly dependent on probability and luck. This is not the kind of game where you have to come up with the perfect strategy, everything has to be under control and then you win. Here you just decide where do you want to go, what quest do you want to try (if you get there in time, do you remember? you have to roll dice!) and roll a bunch of dice and see whether you have been lucky or not.
Having said, that, the game is funny and I do enjoy playing it. I love playing high strategic games with dozens of options and things to do, but that doesn't mean that I can't enjoy playing a more relaxed game with friends just to have a fun time without the pressure of fighting for victory. And, in fact, the things that happen, are thematic and actually fun. The cliffhangers work, they are very fun and I really enjoy the game. I recommend the game to everybody. Maybe this game should not be the main activity of the evening, but just a funny and relaxed way of chilling out.
Positive:
1. Easy to explain and to play
2. Some mechanics are quite thematic (cliffhangers)
3. A good option for every type of player
4. The possibility of playing cooperative
5. It is a fun game
Negative:
1. Movement controlled by dice rolling
2. Excessive luck involved
3. The big box may confuse some players that may think that this is a heavy game. It is not, it is quite light

RATING: N/A
Edit - Yep, reports say stay FAR away from this one due to their typical WAY too high luck design and lack of any substance what-so-ever. A true shame and waste of a good theme and opportunity. 

I think sales tanked for this, maybe FFG will realize there is more to a game than JUST a good theme, and actually 'come to the table' in future designs... (we can hope, anyway) 

---------

Could be their best game yet, though so far none of them have impressed me enough to buy one as usually luck is just too high and they are just too simple overall.  

It sounds the most like ATOE and probably even more fun and the most fun game they have put out yet due to the push your luck element, I do want to play it and with the hefty price tag I'll [i]need[/i] to play it to even entertain a purchase. My worry is with luck being too high the luster will wear off too quickly... Might be a good gateway?

Only played the competitive version. The game looks gorgeous, it has many bits and chrome. However I feel it takes a long time to play for what the game offers, and it has a lot of uncontrollable luck (the BIG sin and what kills the game for me). Some quests seem very hard to accomplish. 

I need to give F&G another chance as the game explainer wasn’t sure about many rules, but my desire to play it is very low. 

Current Rating: 4.5

RATING: N/A
I'm not rating as I've only played the basic game, learning and teaching it on the fly. 

This is an adventure game. You'll enjoy it if you like adventure games and be unimpressed if you don't. Thematically, I love it. As lame as it may sound, I love the adjective/descriptor building of the artifacts of lore. One session the "skull" might be the "Skull of Atlantis" or it might be some other item based upon how the descriptors come up.

What I mean by "It's an adventure game" is that in the end, you will be gathering items and running around the board and dicing off against villains, traps, and cliff hangers. The descriptive text and spirit is dang fun, but will wear thin in lots of plays. Adventure games aren't great games of strategy...they're of chance, story, and pushing your luck.

the game comes with a full game mode, competitive play, solo play, team play. I need to try each one to get a feel for it. It's well produced, it moved fine, I had fun, and I liked the pulp of it. I knew what to expect and it's a good world adventure game.

This is a good adventure game in that vein of games (Runebound, Talisman, Prophecy, Return of the Heroes, etc.). The production of this game is quite high. I really enjoyed that.

If you want grand strategy, you won't find it here, but you are not supposed to--it's not that kind of game. Just know what it's for, the audience it seeks, and have fun. I did.

If you are all about leveling up and maxing out before going after things, the game may be long and repetitive. If however you like the risk and go for it, it's fun.

We did have players lose their characters and restart. Not all cliff hangers were matched. The items you go after get a danger rating based on the descriptors that come up. It does get harder. Cherry pick and remember, it's about the winnings you bring back and sell.

It's got a strong feel of "Arabian Nights" to me, but with out the book, the story and quests come out in the flow. Sometimes, this puts an artifact right smack under the feet of your competition....so what, it's that kind of game. Roll with it.

I've only played this once, and it's a little early to pass judgement (there are advanced rules to add and variants to try). With the basic game, though, I think it's not a game that is very interesting mechanically. You need to get into the theme. Otherwise, you're just rolling dice and seeing what happens. I have hopes for the stories this game might be able to tell, though, and the advanced rules and such might give it some more depth.

RATING: 5
I want to like this game so much, but I just can't.  It's so well put together, great insert, great cards, some mechanics that should be interesting, but I feel like I spend more time fiddling and far less time enjoying.  

Somehow, despite having tons of stuff I feel like I should love, this game ends up falling flat for me.

RATING: N/A
Looks potentially interesting.  Not sure if flipping cards and rolling dice captures the feel of an Indiana Jones movie, but we'll see.  My impression of past Flying Frog Games releases has been that the games look great, but don't quite "capture" the feel of the genre they're in.  I'll be keeping an eye on this one!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Flying Frog has put out some really fun games, but I think this is the best. Base game out of the box plays multiple ways, and that is great in my opinion. Luck plays a big role in the game, read dice here, but that is a good fit for this one. This one has a bit of a curve to it, so allocate some time with new players. If you have a chance to play this I recommend you do, at least once.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Flying Frog expands genres to the adventure film (think Indiana Jones) as you race to get artifacts ahead of either the villainous Nazis or profit-hungry mafia. Cooperative or competitive as usual, with fantastic quality pieces. The down time between plays is a bit longer than Touch Of Evil, though.

BIG PLUS: FLYING FROG!!!!
PLUS: theme, ease of learning, adjustable challenge, quality of pieces
MINUS: down time, can seem too easy at times

Love it. Dripping with theme, awesome components. The Cliffhanger cards are great. It reminds me of Eldritch Horror in a globe spanning kind of way. It's random, but that has never put me off a game. Plus it comes with its own soundtrack CD!

An also-ran that is a more convoluted extension of A Touch of Evil.  I like the idea of the game, I like the theme, I even enjoy the gameplay even though it feels like many of the other Flying Frog games.  I just don't think it separates itself enough from some of the previous releases.  This game has a ton of chrome but the three games I played took more time to unpack and set up the game than it took to play them (2 player games).
I am probably jaded but I was hoping for advances in game design and rules and this just didn't live up to my expectations. However, I really like Conquest of Planet Earth which seems to be ignored by the masses.  Perhaps, it is extremely wise that they didn't stray too far from the formula that has been a success for them.

RATING: 6
This is more super-thematic, super-dicey Flying Frog goodness. The theme, especially is AMAZING, maybe their most thematic game yet. Cliffhanger mechanism is a lot of fun, especially when you don't know the cards yet. However, our game was VERY long (80 min for a partial game to 6, full game is to 15) and had a LOT of downtime. I'm sure that will change with experienced players, but I see downtime as a major problem with 4+ (and the box says 1-8...yipes!).

Edit: 1st full game (3p) revealed the true nature of the press-your-luck mechanic.  Very exciting and thematic, but really needs someone to move it along.  As long as you have that experienced person to keep the game moving, it's a great game for up to 4p.  Can't imagine playing with more, though.

I don't usually like thematic games as much, but I enjoyed this one. It was a nice co-op race against the nazis to recover artefacts. There is plenty of dice rolling and luck, but the cards and board are nicely done and give a feel of adventure.

Definitely wanted this one to be phenomenal - loved the cliffhanger mechanic, adored the theme and the artwork (but hated the soundtrack - surprise!). And granted, there were a couple of games with some great player interaction as we stole assets from each other. But altogether, the turns were just exactly the same - read a card, check your stat, roll some dice. In itself not a bad thing, but plays too long overall for those mechanics.

This game is all about flavor, ambience, and the journey. The cliffhanger mechanic where your turn ends as soon as you screw up adds to the tension. The components are beautiful and high quality.

I've only played this once but cannot recommend it.  The game is beautiful with very nice components and my friend painted the miniatures which adds significantly to the feel and theme of the game.  Unfortunately this game is extremely luck driven.  Everything relies on the result of a die roll.  Those rolls can make or break your entire evening.  There is an initial thrill of the game as you read and undertake fascinating events like flying a plane without a pilot or running from a huge rolling rock but this quickly fades when you start to realize that it might as well say: roll a 6 and continue, roll < 6 and your turn ends.  I know that's an exaggeration but that is how it felt.  The game can also drag on and is much longer than I wanted it to be.  A lot of the time is spent listening to other players read their cards.  I'd definitely play it again but doubt it would change my opinion.

Had one basic, 2 player competitive game and will reserve full judgement until playing both cooperative and an advanced game. The basic competitive set is just too disjointed and virtually no interaction. As it was I got a bunch of bad luck and other player got tons of good luck and game was over in no time. 

Update: Played with advanced rules competitive 2P and while more fun and interesting with the Zepplin and villains popping up plus raising the fortune limit to 20 it's still just not enough going on. Wanted to exhaust all options before giving up on 2P competitive. Next is co-op.

Hard to rate as the first game did drag on too long...

Still managed to stay fun despite the length and multiple questions over the rules.

Want to try again some time and see if we can enjoy the 'theme' a little more rather than worrying about the small rules all the time.

Oh, come on, who couldn't love this! Yes, it's a dice-fest and yes, the "adventures" one conducts don't hang together particularly well, but it's a game that can be played with as much sentimental affection as clearly motivated its designers. The plastic components and theme art are uniformly gorgeous, the rules are surprisingly easy for noobs to learn given how many moving parts there are, the advanced and co-op versions scale up nicely from the basic game, and the Press On/ Camp Down mechanic provides some truly memorable moments of tactical suspense. 

Only two minor complaints - the Danger Deck is way over-short and repetitive and the 'Soundtrack' CD, while a lovely idea, is such a sleepily produced, musically inept cheese-fest that it really should have been left on the cutting room floor.

Lovely components, it's really too bad that it's just a push-your-luck hidden behind a ridiculously complicated ruleset that attempts to mask the fact that your decisions are pretty much meaningless.  Way too much time between turns.  If they even had some mild correlation between location and challenge type (which would in turn hopefully favor some attributes over others) the game would be vastly improved.  Instead you could be freezing in a dessert or in a car chase in a frozen tundra.  Any square just turns out to be the next card.

100% pure Ameritrash goodness.  A dice-chuckin' romp across the world fighting mobsters and Nazis while searching temples for lost treasure.

It's a tad bit fiddly and it does feature roll 'n move, but it's tremendously fun and engaging.  Whether recruiting allies, buying gear, or fending off a Nazi archaeologist to rescue the sword of Zeus, your game night will definitely not be boring!

This game is pretty fun and the theme is quite strong. Set-up is a bit involved and you need a large space to play on. Also, someone needs to be bookkeeper in order to keep track of all the tokens on the board. Plano boxes are a must for organization and box control.

That being said, fighting Nazis and finding treasures is always a good time.

If 'amazing gaming adventure' had a name, it'd be Fortune and Glory - The Cliffhanger game. Love it and everything about it. Some people seem to loathe this game - but I say, just get into the theme and the spirit... and you'll have a blast. Solo with 2 characters is fantastic too. Of course, I am a huuuuge Indiana Jones fan, so this is almost everything I could wish for. Still giving it a 10. Now have 100% of everything released, as well as lots of custom and fan-made goodies too. Awesome.

RATING: 7
Great theme! Despite all the fiddly rules, which I found more so than 'A Touch of Evil', the game flows smoothly after the 1st hour of the basic game. After grasping the rules, we found ourselves racing for the artifacts and trying to outwit each other by pressing our luck. Even players who did not like luck-based games that much enjoyed FANG a lot. The only nitpick that I have is that we went through the whole deck of danger cards in 1 game, which sort of ruin all the mystery after that. The base game is great to begin with, and no big fix necessary. I am hoping that Flying Frog Productions will release an expansion with more cards soon. Expect game time to grow considerably with more players, although co-op and team game mode may probably help.

I have a dice fetish. I like Indiana Jones. This game has plenty of dice and a lot of Indiana Jones references. Good, clean fun. Great theme. Components of a decent quality. Art, meh. There are a lot of rules, and there can be lengthy downtime between turns. Also, player interaction is not that great. It depends on whether you decide to play competitively or co-operatively. So why is this still a favourite of mine? Well, it's just so damn fun to play.

Played it once, in the competitive version (with 5p). Theme is fantastic, gameplay excellent, and the dangers/ennemies/cliffhangers really get you on the edge of your seat for this Indiana Jones like adventure. On the downside, there is very little control, the event cards push the game to twist and turn every instant, which started to agitate our gaming group after some hours...

RATING: 7
Ameritrash pulp adventuring in the 40's with Nazis, mobsters, zombies, and lost treasures? Yes please!

We played the hell out of this game, which is the problem - the encounter (Danger) decks are too small and too repetitive to support prolonged play. The other issue is that there's no correlation between your location on the map and the dangers you face, which breaks the theme too often - an encounter in a submarine pen on a snowy mountain in the middle of the Sahara? What?

Still - great production values, wildly fun while it lasts, and good mechanics that make it play quickly.

Desperately needs an expansion to those Danger decks though.

While I technically "stick" at dice rolling games, THIS game keeps me coming back.  It's a press your luck adventure game that is highly re-playable (due to the amount of cards involved) and it also has several expansions to beef up your card count.  I highly recommend turning on the soundtrack to Indiana Jones and getting some of your friends together for a night of adventure with this excellent product from Flying Frog Games!

Especially the high quality components of the game make it a winner. 

The game mechanics are fine, the different play modi (even single player) keep the game interesting for a long time to go. Lots of advanced rules while keeping basic play simple enough to instantly play against new players. 

Drawback might be considered the amount the game relies on pure chance while undertaking all test and cliffhangers. Even the gear or allies you buy come randomly from shuffled decks. If you do not care for games with much 'luck' or random factors it's not cool. However I found it to be a very immersive and enjoyable game, even with two players.

Cons: Base game is too basic. Co-op is more complicated than it is worth. You are left with solo and competitive play as the only real options. Incredibly random and more fiddly than it needs to be and thus prone to far too much downtime in a four player game. I would play at most 1-3 players. I can not even being to imagine how horrible the downtime would be in a full 8-player game. You could honestly prepare and eat meals before resolving a cliffhanger. Desperately needs to be streamlined. Anybody who has played better modern games, or having any DNA as a game snob is going to hate this game. 

Pros: Does a decent job of telling a story with some quirks to due the random factor. Totally works as a gateway if the players are coming from an old school roll to move type of mindset.

Not a lot of strategy, but awesome components, superb, original and inspiring artwork and tongue in cheek gameplay. I like it! (I'm probably tone deaf, but I actually like the included soundtrack as well). The game is at its most fun if played competitively (or with competing teams) and with the vile organizations. Lots of luck, but lots of fun as well. All models painted.

RATING: 7.25
This game is one of those that requires "the right group" to be fun.

Decisions of all kinds should be made quickly.  It's not about "winning" as much as it is about the experience.  Watching "Indy" agonize for 10 minutes whether to sneak on the U-Boat or not kills the spirit of the game.

Making quick decisions while speaking in goofy accents and being bold even if it gets you knocked out and left penniless can be lots of fun... with the right group.

With standard difficulty (15 VP per player) this game will take about 25 minutes per player in competitive mode.

The ideal range for this is 3 - 5 people.  Larger games- find a way to run things in parallel and efficiently.  Everyone in different challenge areas can resolve their dangers at the same time.  If people are in the same area, they have to swap off- but could do their bit while others work on other bits.

Could be fun with more than two and less than six, if in the right mood for a mostly luck driven experience and trash-talk game; tons and tons of neat stuff in the box, but the photo art work does not hit the right tone in most cases (too many actors are too young, hairdos and makeup do not fit into the era, many costumes look just cheap); gorgeous game board, though.

Played as competitive it was not fun - luck is a huge part of this game and we had a runaway winner we could do nothing about.  Played co-operative the luck still plays a huge part but does not matter so much in terms of enjoyment.

I have to give them credit for really pulling off the cliffhanger idea. The game seems a bit to quick though, and failing one temple might put you too far behind. Luckily there are plenty of cards to make people loss a turn or half a turn. Great way to balance a game where you have to make every turn count.

I love the whole design package - theme, cheesy artwork, included soundtrack.... awesome. The gameplay itself is pretty luck based, but it's not so bad that your tactical decisions don't matter - if they matter A LOT is another question. I have to admit that the game has the "runaway leader" problem - once you get some glory and build your character with gear and allies, it's easier to grab even more glory and, of course, fortune.
The game is a lot of fun for many different audiences.

So a fun romp overall - it definitely captures the feel of pulp heroics and Nazi villains and Temple of Doom treasure hunting.

It's a little too early to judge this game after only 1 co-operative play as I still have to experience the competitive game, solo play and the mobsters instead of the gangsters.

But my initial impression was a little 'meh'. Sure the game is dripping with theme and if you stop to think about how the encounters unfold at each location it is pretty cool.

The reality though is that the game is a little long for what it is and because of that the players tend to try and move through each turn fairly quickly. For me this detracted from the theme, it wasn't allowed to be the star in center stage. 

I like how relics need multiple successes to secure and how rolling for successes is played out over multiple rolls as long as one success is recorded each roll (unlike Arkham Horror). But in truth there is an awful lot of rolling here, far more than Last Night on Earth and for me the whole experience outstayed its welcome somewhat. 

Still...more plays needed to sure up my thoughts.

My first couple of turns dragged due to constant looking up at rules (which could be tightened up).  After getting over the hump, the game began to shine and move at a good clip.

Smash Nazis and steal their treasure!  Takes a while to set up and get going and consumes space like Unicron consumes planets, but great fun once it starts.  More quality gaming and components from FFP (not to be confused with FFG!).  Indiana Jones the board game, if they could afford the license.

I first played this at Gen Con 2012.  It catches the feel of an Indiana Jones movie so well.  You really feel like your on a hunt for a great artifact! The only problem I have ever run into with it is the pace.  Anything over four people really slows the game down to a crawl.  Still love it though, best with three!

RATING: 7

Old:
Love Touch of Evil. The whole soundtrack plus heavy theme plus real actors/props/stylized art plus glossy high quality feel plus casual--not too much depth gameplay but not too light that it feels like an exclusively family or childrens game. Basically everything about how this game has been described I love and since I found a good deal on it, excited to have it coming because Touch of Evil taught me that the most important thing for a themed board game isn't pure skill but providing a real experience, in these cases a cinematic and fast paced climactic one.

I love love love the theme and love that it's a deluxe high-end, expensive, lavish production. This will be the highest tiered game I'll own and am really looking forward to it and playing it with it's own soundtrack as well as soundtracks to Mummy and Indiana Jones movies.

UPDATE:

I'm finding that despite the coop mode being good, unlike other flying frog production games which generally I prefer coop, I may prefer this one competitive. It's possible that there's no showdown it's missing out on, or that there's already enough bookkeeping without coop and competitive keeps it moving faster, but either way, competitive seems to make for a more fun game.

I have devised a variant/set of house rules to make this game easier to teach to new players as well as more fast-paced and less frustrating/punishing. This variant is designed to be played without a vile organization and in the competitive style:

I love the flexibility in this game. Being able to play competitive, cooperative, solo, and in teams is a huge plus! I really like the stories that emerge from playing this game. This game could become boring if players do not read the flavor text on the cards and embelish the story a little. For this reason, this game might not be for everyone. I personally find this game very enjoyable. I do wish the rulebook was a little better and clarified a few points. I think an expansion would really improve this game with more dangers and vile organizations to face against!

--- Preliminary thoughts ---

Pick-up and deliver adventure game with important press your luck and variable powers component.

The cards define the objectives and the villains and ensure replayability.

The pulp theme is very well represented.

Otherwise, the little rules are way excesive for a game that is quite simple in its core.

It is way expensive; maybe not that expensive for the components (arguable), but certainly expensive for what it is.

Fortune and Glory was great fun. I can't imagine playing F&G in a serous atmosphere, with careful calculation and precise plotting: if that's what you want, I don't think it's a good fit. But as a relaxed and light-hearted "playtime" game it is super.

The box is gigantic, and comes packed with cards, counters, coins... and figures! So many minis! The rulebook is pleasant to read and nicely illustrated; but quite long, jumps about quite a bit, and desperately needs an index - this is actually a bit of a problem.

There are several hundred cards, which are difficult to shuffle (blunt edges, if that makes sense) and will actually be improved by sleeving. They are clear and very attractive. There has been some excellent attention paid to the physical component design: hundreds of bits, 10 (?) different decks of cards, many counters, and not a single one of them causes any problems with colourblindness. Seriously- that's an achievement, and Flying Frog deserve credit.

"DOCTOR ZHUKOV and THE HAMMER OF THE MONKEY GOD"!

Fortune and Glory is one of the most colourful, entertaining and thematical games I have ever played! So rich in ideas and flavour, so beautiful components and all in TOP quality, so wonderfully simple yet effective rules... It could as well be called "The Indiana Jones Adventure Game" - temples, villains, car races, allies, items, events... If you are a friend of thematic games, then you have to try this!

BUT: It's too light. Gameplay is basically very similar to "Last Night on Earth".

RATING: 8
Outstanding! Flying Frog and Jason Hill have taken all the best ingredients from LNOE and AToE, Conquest of Planets Earth and Invasion from Outer Space, added some more great mechanics...mixed it up and have quite a masterpiece of a game here. I would even say if you enjoy Tales of the Arabian Nights, this game might be another great one to try. When I saw the first demo of this game, I was sold! 

This game thrusts you into the world and life of Indiana Jones. You might be fighting your way through the jungle in search of a hidden temple, you might have to fight the mob or the Nazi's along the way. The cards are just terrific! I cannot say enough about the clever, funny, and even stereotypical events that you will encounter. 

Upon selecting my first danger in my first adventure, I found my character climbing a mountain...only to fail my roll and be thrust into the cliffhanger of encountering an avalanche. But what about the car chases...that if failed send you careening over the edge of a cliff with the possibility of trying to escape out the back window or try to escape through a jammed door. What to do...what to do! Absolutely thrilling, hilarious and I love it!

As always I have no problem with the realistic card art. I always love the real people pictures, it really makes you feel part of a movie type experience while playing a game. The quotes on the cards always make me laugh, it's one of my favorite things about Flying Frog Games. When I first opened the box, I was totally in awe of the beautiful board. I love a game with a good map, and this one is what I dreamed an adventure map would look like.

I hope Flying Frog will indulge us with future card expansions. I don't ever want to run out of those dangerous event cards. I would love to keep the game fresh and interesting even with many repeated plays.

As a slight aside, we were getting ready to play our 1000th owned and played game. When I received an email saying our Pre-order of Fortune and Glory was being shipped in two days. We held out to play "This" game as our 1000th owned and played game!

Dice, dice, dice and more dice. And add a ton of chrome around it to make the dice feel relevant. The dice mechanics are fun (as long as you get one success, pick em all up and roll again to get more), and the cliffhanger process (initiated when you miss getting a success) is a fun mechanic as well, giving you one more chance to eke out a success next turn. And it's thematically fantastic. This is a game suited only to those who are willing to ham the theme up, hum the Indiana Jones theme song, and are happy to live and die by the dice. I can see myself having fun with it every now and then. Having both competitive and co-operative modes is a plus, as is the solo option. Having said that, learning and implementing a whole new layer of complexity for co-op and solo mode is painful, taking the chrome a step too far, which is one reason I don't rate the game higher.

The problem that this game, along with most of FFG's games, is that in spite of the amazing imagination and intent that goes into it, it is messy and overtly complicated. They do their best to incorporate so many elements of the genre, but it sacrifices replayability. LNOE, though it can still be trying, never fails to inspire cinematic moments that capture people's attention. Fortune and Glory? Not so much.

RATING: 7
"Move around the world, flipping cards and rolling dice. I'm only interested in the co-op mode, which is good, but the randomness/time ratio is a bit high for my tastes. The same game with a space exploration theme would rate at least a point higher. My rating is a 'high 7'."

What I like:
- Dice challenge mechanisms are far more interesting than Arkham Horror
- The push-your-luck mini-game at each artifact site
- Cliffhangers give you a second chance after a failure
- Moving around the map

What I don't like:
- 2-3 hours for a high randomness game is pretty long
- I don't happen to love the Indy Jones theme (it's OK)
- The rulebook doesn't quite answer everything, which is frustrating. 

There are quite a few rules, but not as many as I had feared. Once you get a handle on it, it plays pretty smoothly. It reminds me of Arkham Horror, but plays far  smoother and more quickly. I think the BGG-voted weight of 2.8 is reasonable, due to complexity, not depth.

Flying Frog's game of Indiana Jones style 1930s adventure with the players taking the role of globetrotting heroes grasping ancient artefacts before the Nazis or the Mob can get their hands on them. I found that the Adventure deck was a bit repetitive, but expansions have solved this by doubling the number of cards. I roll a die for each Adventure with a third chance of the hero encountering an Enemy card, which are otherwise seldom used. I also devised a system of playing with two or three Vile Organisations rather than just the one. A fun game.

This is an adventure-style game where you move your character around the board, pick up or buy cool items, beat up bad guys, and complete quests.  The "cliffhanger" mechanic where your turn ends in the middle of a quest is a little corny, but goes well with the theme.  I enjoy adventure games so I liked this, but I only played the basic version.  I'd like to give the advanced version a try at some point.

(4 plays)  We played this game against the Nazi's 3 times in succession.  We absolutely got our asses kicked every time.  It wasn't even close.  And I still had a blast.  The fourth game, we figured out that we had been scoring the Villains wrong, and we won the game just as the villains were ramping up in power.  

In one game, I flew a plane to get to a temple, which crashed (cliffhanger), I survived the crash and found a car, was chased to the temple and barely survived (cliffhanger), where I was shot at by Nazi henchmen.  I made it to the Temple, which collapsed just as I departed.  I was knocked out cold, and woke up disoriented in my home city of Moscow.  That was 3 turns...  There were tons of events like this throughout those three games.

For all I know, the game is totally out of whack, unbalanced, and impossible to win.  I don't much care, it was a great experience of a game, and I'll play again.

It is a rules heavy game, and that is to its detriment.  IMHO, you could wipe out about half of the rules and counters and combine some decks of cards without fundamentally changing the fun of this game.  It's really just the adventure cards that make this game, and everything else is just accounting.  Still worth it, but I wouldn't mind seeing the "less is more" version of this game.

I bought this at least 2 years ago, being attracted by the Indiana Jones-type theme of 1930s world travel, treasure-seeking, baddie-avoiding derring-do. Unfortunately, and I realise this is a stupid and personal issue, the whole ambience is ruined for me by the character art on the box, character sheets and cards: every hero and villain is depicted by rather cheesy photographs of the game designer and friends in fancy dress. Some of them are truly excruciating to look at, particularly a British character in a ridiculous wig and moustache. I'll try to get over it as I do want to introduce it to my usual group.

Fortune and Glory or should I say Glory and Fortune or does it matter?  First off the Glory is how you spend money and the Fortune is how you get victory points.  That is backwards in my thinking but I didn't design the game.  

If I did design the game I would have made a much better rule book.  There are so many holes and all this with no index?  You got to be kidding.  You will slug through the rule book so much your head will hurt trying to find things that you find out are not there.  Maybe that is why there are pages and pages of rule clarification in the forum.

Lots of bits, I love bits.  Lots of cards, I love cards. But do you use them all?  Nope, just takes up table space with some of it.  So that makes them worthless and stupid to have them.  You will constantly be taking a bit, rolling dice, taking a bit, rolling dice, then putting the bits all back cause you passed a danger.  Lots of these bits are just to indicate what you are doing.  Too much crap to deal with and not necessary.

Ok, that was the main complaints.  What I like is that the game has so many things to do and ways to go.  I like it.  I like being busy with things to do in a game.  Maybe that's why I don't play Toy R Us games.  They bore me.  I like to think I am a grognard type player cause I have been known to read a manual for 2 weeks to learn the game and I love it, like watching a great movie or reading a great book; you don't want it to end.  So one has to make some decisions as to how to play the game cause the manual is so bad, and I get tired of going to the forum for clarifications.  But you can do this with this game. And that is why I really like the game despite the issues I brought up.  

I will rate the game a 9.  It is a lot of fun and lots to do.

I have a lot of mixed feeling for Fortune and Glory. I love the historical theme, however (and I know that FFP is behind it), it lacks consistency. I know they wanted a good fun game, and they have it, but it is just not for me. I know there are better games for me out there.

The theme is awesome! Very enjoyable. Nice thematic elements. Couldn't help humming Indiana Jones music when i was overcoming the dangers! Advanced game adds some nice elements.

Fans of Flying Frog Press games will find more of the outstanding production quality for which its games are known.  Nothing skimpy going on here.  If Incan Gold isn't scratching your Indiana Jones fantasy because you haven't been killing enough Nazis or finding enough artifacts, this is the game for which you have been waiting.  Players can compete or cooperate as they treasure hunt and preform daring and foolish feats.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This was a risky purchase for me not least because the cost (and content)is equal to two Flying Frog games. This is my initial impression based on demo/solo play, as such I havent given it a proper rating yet:
The rulebook could be better, if you dont solo play/demo this game a couple of times before introducing this to a group you will kill the game. You need to know the rules cold and avoid the temptation of adding advanced elements in your first few games. The biggest problem is the rulebook,its look good enough, most of the information is there but when you actually demo you find yourself searching through the rulebook to find stuff you need. Its not as if its a complicated game but the rulebook is confusing. I wonder if the designer had a blind spot here with the rulebook.
 Now the good stuff, its a fantastic deeply thematic game, theres a real development in mechanics from previous games, they suit the theme perfectly, likewise the way the cards play of each other is great. The components are fantastic especially the board and the miniatures although some, not all of the photo art is a bit ropey. A great game but learn the rules  or just play basic the first couple of games, you have been warned...and no I haven't taken the shrink of the CD.

Rules are somewhat of a mish-mash. Lots of chrome which adds to the moving parts. Absolutely nails the theme. Sometimes it really feels like you are a character in your own pulp adventure novel.

You need the right group and a bit of time to really enjoy this one. The game is full of silly fun - boarding a zeppelin to steal gold and punch Nazis while your buddy rescues an ancient artifact from the villain's clutches at the last seconds does make some memorable stories.

This might be my favorite game that I don't own. 
It's too much money and the box is TOO BIG.
I wish they sold a lite version that did NOT come with the bits that are only used in the advanced game. I'd never play the advanced game so they are not needed. Did not knew it existed until someone told me I used the same rolling mechanic in my game.

A very beautifull game and my introduction to more advanced board games. 

It really makes you feel like you are in an Indiana Jones movie and the strong theme makes it easy for you to see the events happening to your chosen character. 

Often that makes for a funny story to laugh about with your friends as you play the game. 

A lot of rules with it but it makes sense and is easy to remember once a game has been played, its just those little things that dont happen in every game that requires me to consult the manual. 

Probably my favorite board game, I can recommend it to any movie fan.

RATING: 6
Component Quality:
Very high. Flying frog always takes great care including plenty of miniatures, nice boards and thick cards, however, Fortune & Glory might be the first FF game to charge a bit too much for its contents. There's not much extra in this box compared to, say, Last Night on Earth.

Gameplay:
This might be the most balanced of the Flying Frog games. For a big box game it surprised me how fast it played. Easy to a finish game in an hour. Even so, it can start to feel repetitive. Feels like the numbers play a more important role than the story/theme, which is a shame since the theme is so excellent. A few more plays will decide if this one's a keeper.

RATING: 7.25
1/30/2012 - Played 2 games of coop.

Pros
- components are (for the most part) top notch.  Character figurines are cool, Zeppelin figurine is *really* cool, cards should stand up to repeated plays.
- Theme is well integrated into the game.  The Danger/Cliffhanger cards worked well and it gave me a good feeling of being in a pulp adventure.

Cons
- rulebook is confusing with little rules scattered here and there.  There is a *non-alphabetized* glossary at the back of the book.  Even after 2 play throughs, I am absolutely certain we aren't playing everything correctly.
- not enough danger cards!  We need more variety in this deck or the game starts to get stale.  Considering the price tag of this game, there is no good excuse to not include more of these (even if it meant reducing the number of cards in some of the other decks)

Misc (not necessarily bad or good, but should be noted)
- game runs a bit long.  By its very nature a game like this will take a while, so if you don't like long games stay away.
- the resources of "fortune" and "glory" seem backward.  You spend glory (blue coins) to buy things and you earn fortune (gold coins) to win the game. Not that big of a deal, but had everyone at the table scratching their heads and asking why it was backwards.

Overall thoughts - this is a good game, and may be even better once I *know* the rules.  Theme is important to me, and the game comes through in spades.  There is a lot of die rolling for success, but I am fine with that.  If they had spent money on hiring a technical writer to write the manual (and included a well detailed flow chart) and included more danger cards it could have been great.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun, pretty components, decent system. But the one flaw is that the challenges can be pretty random. I'm in a temple that could crumble but according to this card I'm having an Air chase... It's a bit hard to connect the gameplay to the theme...

Had to give up this one in a trade for Archipelago... Worth it.

Beautiful looking game but unfortunately the good reviews end there.  This is way to fiddly and too random with dice rolling to be fun as a solo game. The rolling mechanics have no strategy at all.  No decisions on how to modify anything.  Some how the rules are too fiddly to really get immersed in the theme and with bad movement dice you are stuck really doing nothing as you wonder slowly to artifacts that are quickly gobbled up by the villains.  The set up and break down on this game it lengthy.  I like RPG type board games.  Tale of Arabian knights is a far superior game in this same genera however, it is much let fiddly and is soaked with theme.  As for a competitive game, however, can it really be competitive if there are no real decisions. One of the worst experiences since Arkham Horror when pertaining to an epic solo/co-op type game

Essen 2011 buy. Expensive, but worth it. Great adventure game, and the cliffhangers are just that. It surprises me how close the finishes are most of the time. This one will continue to see a lot of play time. So far definitely prefer the competitive game.

RATING: 7
Good chrome and fun. Good components quality, although I don't like Flying Frog design and texture of cards and tokens. A bit lazy mechanics: too many dice for everything, but without the feeling of having a dicefest. 

It needs a new and hugest danger deck and an event deck that reinforces interaction between players. And more villain organizations.

Enjoyable.

Ugh - exactly the kind of thing which I hate but that one of our gaming group loves (guess who owns this game then). There was a period back in 2011/12 when we played this fairly often, but I don't think I've played it since 2013. I guess it's not that bad in moderation, but I can't say this dice-fest is much fun. I have nothing against dice, but they have to provide some intelligent decisions. This one, not so much - and the downtime involved in waiting for everyone else to complete their multi-part adventures, or fail in the attempt, can be excruciating.

RATING: 2
This game is terrible. It is like a multi-player solitaire version of Last Night on Earth. The latter game is far better than this one (and Timber Peak is better than both). There are many issues with this game:

1) The downtime kills the game all by itself. I have played this game with 4, 5, and 8 players. At each size of group, it often takes 10-20 minutes for you to get a turn.
2) Events are awesome. . . if you get them. In general, people who get lucky die rolls (and subsequent draws from the deck) win.
3) Winning is essentially a random exercise that has little to no grounding in your play or strategy. I'm fine with luck driving the day, but when there is no real impact you can make as a player to affect your status in the game, why play?
4) Far too few adventure cards for the number that are needed. Far too many of other decks that are hardly used. 
5) Characters are unbalanced, so much so that if you aren't playing the best one, just go home.
6) Replay value is low.
7) The most recent game (with 8 players) I played took 3 hours before we called it for time. If left alone, the game would have taken at least another 3 hours. Simply unacceptable for the quality of game experience.
8) The "story" that is supposedly told by the game to make all of the above palatable is laughably bad, from illogical leaps to u-boats in landlocked Russia. Terrible.
9) Need I talk about the sound track? WTF?

This last comment is probably slightly unfair, but I suspect that the "good" ratings for this game are from people who paid $100 for it, and have too much pride to admit the game is truly worthless. Wow. I didn't realize how much I hated this game until I typed that.

09-03-2014. Rated after 1 play. Game about adventuring in the 30's. Setting and theme is cool. Game has excellent production values and components. Weird fake/b-movie style artwork and figures.

The game itself is fun, in a Talisman way. It's quite ok, but you're rolling dice the while time. You can mitigate luck a little, but it lacks involvement because your influence is absent.

GenCon 2011 purchase.  This was the game I was most excited about at GenCon 2010. Great theme, and a great adventure mechanic where failure has actual consequences for the player...and yet, -4 for completely cumbersome minutia in the rules that slow down gameplay and that keeps this game from ever getting on the table!  

Some careful streamlining would have helped enormously.

Wow. This game's awful! Played the basic competitive game, and it's a dicefest of nothing but skill checks and encounters you have little or no control over. The board's pretty pointless, since the game is deck-driven. Talisman has more going for this. I still haven't tried the advanced or coop rules, so I recommend you play solo the basic game to learn the basic rules, then play the advanced or coop with your gaming group. Won't miss this one (or LNOE) if I trade it away.

I really don't know why I don't like this more - for some reason, this game just dosen't attract me as much as 'AToE' or 'LNoE'. Maybe a case of too high expectations coupled with fairly stagnant development by FFG - it's not really an improvement on AToE or LNoE - in spite of the big box.

Mechanically, this game is much the same - and it's quite enjoyable (lacking the AToE problem of drawing the players into over-building up by giving them virtually no chance to do so).

Thematically, this is probably a better fit for me - but for some reason I just prefer AToE.

Oh man, this game. First off, it's huge. It is an eater of tables. There are also so many decks it is ridiculous. It is the most campy game I own and I love it.

Super randm but super fun. Played this with different types of people - even non-gamers. It creates those absurd stories: cartwright wants to cross a river to reach a temple: he tries to jump over it with a car but crashes the cars and survives but swims to the wrong side of the river. He trys the exact same thing again; and again unsuccessfull! He takes a plane, but the plane crashes and he somehow survives. Looking around he notices that there is a pendnant bridge and just crosses it...

Fun, thematic and full of luck "Indiana Jones" old school adventure game. Players go around the world trying to get ancient artifacts, or exploring lost temples, in their quest for fortune and glory, with some Nazis and mobsters in the way. Not a game for everyone, because it is full with dice rolls, card draws and unespected events, but its target audience will enjoy it to death.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a fun thematic game along the lines of Talisman or Merchants and Marauders, but I feel this game has two major flaws.

The first is that the box says it plays 1-8 players.  I played at a table of 6 and the game was excruciatingly long (4.5 hours, not an exaggeration).  If not for the player who owned the game "running" the game (telling players it was their turn, and what skill to roll) this game would have simply fallen apart because at that number you have so little interaction with the game itself.  Now I like a nice long game, but this game was simple, you had choices, but the choices were simple too.

The second flaw is the end game.  Sure, it was a tense race for the finish with many players near victory, BUT IT JUST KEPT GOING! There were so many cards that said "you think you win? Well YOU LOSE!" This could have been coupled with the first problem (having 6 players with hands of card), but we just kept wailing on one another. Players were simultaneously wishing for the game to end while preventing anyone from winning.

A smaller complaint I have are the cliffhanger cards, there simply are too few of them.  Over the course of the game (which I assume was abnormally long) we recycled the deck and saw the same cliffhangers several times throughout the game.

Overall it was a fun game though, particularly the first 90-120 minutes were enjoyable.  I would play this again as the theme was fun, but I will never play this with more than 4 and might even prefer 3 or 2. The components are great, though the figures could benefit from a bit of colour coding. The flavour text is excellent.

You spend glory to buy items, and acquire ancient artifacts that give you fortune (which you can't spend). How backwards is that! How is it possible that nobody at Flying Frog threatened to set themselves on fire if these resources weren't swapped?

Anyhow, it's a decent story-telling game, and the events and trials go together well enough that you feel like a character in an Indiana Jones film.

Fortune and Glory, by itself, is a passable game.  I'd give it a 6, probably, if I hadn't played other Flying Frog titles.  And there's the rub -- I love Last Night on Earth and it has a solid spot in my heart.  But FF has made four games since then -- Invasion from Outer Space (a LNoE clone), A Touch of Evil (a somewhat-creative game that I didn't enjoy), Conquest of Planet Earth (would love to play this co-op), and now this.  Well, five games later, and I'm still seeing 90% of this game having LNoE mechanics.  I mean, come on.  It makes for a repetitive, almost dull experience to keep having the same things in their games.  And I see what they were trying to do here, and it's a great effort, it is.  But man, the collapsing of temples and cliffhangers and everything -- I didn't like ANY of it.  The rest is just stuff I've seen before.  I haven't played CoPE yet, but I'm willing to bet that some of the same mechanics are in that one too.  FF better step it up with the next game.  Come on guys, you have a great company, but FanG was a step back.

For a sprawling adventure game meant to feel like an Indiana Jones movie, it seems like the rules could have been slimmed down more, shifting the focus instead to boosting the variety of cliffhangers, villains, artifacts, and action scenes. 

I'm not a fan of the company's art design, which makes heavy use of actual staged photographs. It comes off as a little cheap and inside-jokey somehow.

Oh my God, the dice, but honestly it's dripping with theme and this mostly salvages it.  It's terribly luck-based, but it's clear a lot of love went into developing the characters, cards, and abilities.  I'll gladly play with 4 or less, but anything higher would be torture.  Not the worst game I've ever played, but probably the worst game I've played I can stomach this much.

Edit:  dropped to a 5 because of the cooperative mode. I definitely won't play that way again, though competitive isn't too shabby. Still the best worst game I've ever liked somewhat.

Lightning struck, picked this up as "damaged" on eBay. Box (still in shrink) had a several inch long dent on one side, less than one inch deep. No effect at all on components. Might be enough to affect box integrity, but I don't pile games very high, so... Total damage: $55. Now I just need to get people to play it with me :-)

One game finished, a three player co-op. Holy crap there's a lot to keep to track of in this game. I seriously need a well organized FAQ for this one...

*EDIT* After many plays, this keeps its 9 rating. It's a favorite of the group. Holy crap there's a lot to keep track of...

Cute, but like most AT games IMO, suffers from the "too much stuff, not enough game."  It's a fun distraction, but not something I'd go out of my way to play again.  I did like the "press your luck" mechanics and how beautiful all the bits were.

I wish that I had played this a few times before deciding to buy it. It is a lot of fun, but I'm not sure that it's worth the price tag. The components are top-notch and in ample supply. The box size is outrageous and could have been done much smaller. Had I played it first, I would have waited for a cheaper used copy.

Great theme play.  Game fairly easy to learn and play.  Game play features lots of dice rolling and a strong luck factor.  Components are very good - colorful mounted board, thick cardboard chits, plastic playing pieces and durable thick glossy cards.  Rulebook is in color, but could have been better organized.

A bit random and too big, but it makes for a fun game of racing to collect treasure. We've only been playing the co-op variant; the foes are pretty easy to beat, but it gives a nice feel of racing against an active opponent.

This is pretty much Indiana Jones the board game.  Travel the world to search for ancient treasure while fighting/escaping enemies who are trying to do the same.  There is a cooperative play option as well.

The game is very thematic.  There are many different challenges you face during the course of play.  You can also gain allies and gear to help you face those challenges.  Enemies in addition to your opponents will hinder you along the way.

The best part of the game is the production value of the pieces.  All of the cards are printed on a thick stock and glossy.  The art on the cards are nice.  The models are mono-coloured with some good detail.  The currency coins are quite fancy.  There is even a CD with theme music you can play in the background.

I really think they went way overboard with the production value.  The game is quite expensive.  The game play is good, but I personally would have preferred a lower price point.  They probably could do without the CD theme music (which I played once and probably will never play again) at all.  Normal card stock would have been OK for me as I sleeve my cards.  I managed to get it on sale and that was less than $70 CDN.  I've seen it close to $120 CDN at stores.

I would recommend this game if you can get it on sale.  For the full price, I'd rather buy two other games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Great adventure pulp game. It is all chrome and theme, and if you like light-hearted immersive games where you are part of a story, this might be a game for you.

Though the components are top notch, game is overpriced for what you get. Especially with great kickstarter adventure productions around nowadays. Also, it sorely needs an expansion to keep replayability to an acceptable level. And if that is overpriced as well, I suggest you look otherwise to get your gaming fix.

If you can get a copy cheap or price is no consideration for you, what you get is a very enjoyable immersive game, full of theme and opportunities for epicness. We had great fun with this game and in the end that is what matters.

Recommended for the rich gamers, fond of story and theme, looking to add one Ameritrash gem to their collection.

Jan 2014: We played again, competitive mode this time and that really ruins the game. As exciting as repeatedly rolling dice and award a point to highest roll. First to 15 wins.

As a race game, this totally falls flat. As a cooperative game, it is quite entertaining, but not enough to keep it in my collection. 

Jan 2014: Sold off.

A bloated dice-beast of a game.

I think there will be replayability issues and there was way too much downtime with 5 newbie players, but cutting this to 3 and knowing the game better I can see this being playable in 90 minutes which is what it needs to be.

Update: Played a second time; no meaningful decisions, a long drawn out end game, huge swings of randomness and, oh did I mention roll and move?!

Fun game, a ride game, very random. Definitely needs the expansions, have had some genuinely laugh out loud moments.  Components are great.

Once you add expansions it like Arkham, quite alot of little rules etc to remember, but the extra stuff offered in the expansions really round out the game.

Little player interaction.  Rote mechanics.  Bo-ring.

Downtime.  I would estimate your downtime between rolls as three minutes times the number of players.  So, 8 player game is about 20 minutes of downtime between rolls.

All the minis look alike.  Players don't know who they are or where they are.

One play - Very impressive components, gorgeous board and graphics imo.
the luck factor is really important : it's a real dice fest for sure but you have some strategy when choosing the right moment to play or use your gears, allies and event cards. Time will tell if I will increase my rating.

RATING: 4
There isn't much "game" here. It is an exercise in theme and experience. If you take it for what it is, a simulation of the Indiana Jones type adventure stories, then you can gather some enjoyment from the artwork and cliffhanger cards (which, to be fair, are quite creative). If, however, you are looking for a competitive game, look elsewhere. The push-your-luck mechanic isn't bad, but certainly isn't enough to carry the entire game. Despite me winning, I felt the game lacking.

If the game was shorter, I may have a different opinion. Likewise, I suspect I may be a candidate for the cooperative game, where I could enjoy the theme without getting bent out of shape over arbitrary card pulls and dice rolls.

Loving, loving, loving this game! So long as you're happy to let the story carry you along and are not expecting much strategy, I think it's one of the most fun games I know of. A little too random and anticlimactic (sudden ending with no arc) for a rating higher than 8 though.

There is a lot to like in Fortune and Glory, including dual currencies, mix 'n match adventures, and conflicts that escalate like mousetraps when they're not cleanly resolved. But the price is out of touch with reality.  The obese box is full of air, the sculpts are difficult to distinguish, and the cast looks like a high-school drama club.  It's the fundamentals, folks!  Replayability looks good if you like the system, but forget playing eight.  Three sounds right.

For some reason, non-gamers love this game. Really, give it a shot. It may convert them.

FanG isn't a brilliant game from a strategist's perspective, but it's a very effective evocation of a very amusing type of story.  I've had nothing but good times playing it, generally find it to be an interesting challenge, and really enjoy the wild, globe-spanning narratives it inevitably generates.  Trying to link difficult-to-connect adventure cards in an appropriately pulpy manner is part of the fun for me.

 Need more plays of this. Can be frustrating due to the chance that you can have multiple cliffhanger failures which can set you back in the game early if you are playing a competitive game. Just the base game itself seems to be fine but I do agree with others where as the danger deck could have been much bigger. My plays so far have been fun overall experiences.

The cool story is consumed by many rules, procedure and repetition. I am also not sure decisions are meaningful enough for the long playtime.

Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 4
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 1

This game is filled with theme and fun.  Unfortunately it's just too much for my family/group and I don't know that it's really going to get much (or any?) play time.

There is so much in this game--great concept, great components, and an ingenious system of play.  In a way it's something of a masterpiece, and as such, I would love to give it a higher rating. However, it is also difficult to play, not that the system is so arcane, but because there is so much.  Perhaps if I had more game-partners to play with we could attack it together.  But unfortunately there is no one I know that is interested.  As a consequence, I am left to go it alone, an FanG is not as inviting to solitaire play as Touch of Evil is.  I'll bet it's a blast with a group, but solitaire, it's a 500 lb gorilla.

It costs a fortune, and its gloriously stupid!
Ameritrash at its most Ameritrash-y. Put your brain on hold, crack open some beers, and get ready to roll some dice and have 'stuff' happen.
Also get ready to forget half of the rules as there are a lot. Yes, this game will require a 'designated driver' if there is booze involved.
It's still fun to pull out once in a while, just don't play it with more than 5 or it will take an excruciatingly long time to get back to your turn again.

The epitome of bad ameritrash.

Roll-and-move.  Then flip over a card, and roll the dice it tells you to, to see what happens. ad infinitum.

the rulebook is horrendously laid out (non-alphabetical glossary anyone?).  the print on the abilities of the adventure descriptor cards (the "of illusion", "of doom" ones) is too small, to the point where 5 people didn't notice it until multiple turns into the game (and I'm rarely one to complain about small print).

The game is very pretty.  It is not very much of a game, though, and randomness is not theme.

Very good, fun, light-hearted, push your luck, "experience" adventure game (effectively the Indiana Jones boardgame). Essentially just a massively pimped up Incan Gold but with lots of fun storytelling and theme. 

Some downtime and fairly few and simple decisions to be made when played competitively - but still fun when players get into the spirit of the game and the unfolding story.

Best played cooperatively as a massively pimped up Incan Gold + Pandemic with the hero players working together trying to beat The Nazis and/or The Mob to recover the treasures and stop them to take over the world.

May run a bit too long depending on how the treasures and dangers/cliffhangers turn out, but may also turn into truly epic and fun stories with close defeats or victories.

This is definitely my fave from Flying Frog now.  I love zombies and aliens and monsters, but this one is just frothing theme and flavor!  Nazi/Gangster action!  Perilous traps and bloodthirsty natives!  Glorious treasures and beautiful women (when my wife plays)!  The scope is epic and the gameplay is equally so.  Sidekicks and bullwhips and Cliffhanger endings are but a fraction of what this game has to offer and even though the price tag is a tad on the high end, it is very, VERY much worth your time and effort to play this game :-)

For a game about the pulp genre some people seem to be expecting something cerebral.  This game should be approached as like a pulp film or novel its bold brash and fun, and you can play the game without worrying about strategies and tactics.

We were underprepared for our first game.  We started off playing 30% correctly, and by the end we fought our way up to 70%.

To state the obvious, Fortune and Glory is directly inspired by [i]Raiders of the Lost Ark[/i], sometimes verbatim.  If [i]Raiders[/i] is your favorite movie, F&G is probably worth a few laffs.  If any other movie is your favorite movie, you should probably play a game based on that movie instead.  Personally, I'm holding out for [i]Tootsie[/i].

I'll play F&G at least twice more - once with the advanced rules, and once as a coop.  But I'm not convinced that either will dramatically improve my impression of the game.  We've seen most of what's there, I think - literally, since the Danger cards are recycled rather quickly.  Though, to be fair, what's there is exactly what we expected: random foes, events, and die rolls, with someone eventually winning.

If you were expecting something else, you may need to adjust your life expectations.

indiana jones!  yes, this is a fun game that oozes theme, which is just what i like.  the map is beautiful, and the cards are delicious and quite plentiful.  competitive play works pretty well, and the bonus of having cooperative play is icing on the cake.  good job.

Add it to the list of one player games I would like to see hit the table in 2015.

Really enjoyed this game.  The only issue is the time and space needed to get this monster out and to get it going.  Also not sure on replayability.  Regardless, I'm happy to have it in the collection.

The box artwork and character art looks particularly weak. Maybe they had difficulty getting the "right" costumes, or they're just getting lazy - as someone else pointed out, the photos give the impression of a high school drama project. After the superb artwork demonstrated on the [i]Conquest of Planet Earth[/i] game, I believe paintings would have been the way to go here as well.

1-8 players (Flying Frog's usual boast) is also a joke. All their other games drag almost to a standstill with 4+ players.

After the pretty craptastic Invasion/Circus game, I was hoping for better from this title. All that said, we had fun playing it.

The binary system for selecting legendary artefacts, like the Spear of Atlantis or Skull of Medusa is nifty. I also admire the cliffhanger/danger card system - a nice bite of push-your-luck.

In summary, the game has far too many wheels spinning for my liking. A pulp, two-fisted, Nazi-punching adventure game should fly along at a rollicking old speed, with no time to catch your breath - this game takes all evening, has at least one or two phases too many, and is a disappointment to me.

I do give it a thumbs up for making the most use of a Swastika in any game I have yet seen, and that includes [i]Escape from Colditz![/i]

The CD is the worst yet. The absolute worst.

hmm.. played it once and had absolutly no fun after the second turn. i dont like it when poor dice rolls decide if the game is fun or not, from 4 heroes 3 did nothing but die no matter if the had gear and allies or not, and one just blazed through 2 adventures with one gear and won. very exciting.
will try the cooperative mode in a while, maybe its funnier..

Cool experience by the Flying Frog guys.  Better than A Touch of Evil just owing to the different setting, but I'd still rather play Arkham Horror and with Eldritch Horror on the horizon (which is likely to fill the same niche), I see no reason to own this one for myself.

Wanted to like it, but it's just clunky. Better stuff out there.

The only reason this isn't a 10 is because there's too many times where even if I wanted to play a game of it, I'd have to turn it down because.. 90 minutes? HAH! Maybe if you're playing 2 player competitive, know all the rules by heart and have luck on your side. Multiple hours is my usual experience, and I love it that way!

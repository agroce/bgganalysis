Bought for the solitaire element, actually... but I don't believe it will ever grace the table. :(

UPDATE: Not a bad two plays thus far. More time required for a more refined rating on this one. The problem it faces is that it must compete with the most EXCELLENT Claustrophobia.

This game plays pretty quickly, has a lot of options, and never lets down. This base set is so good, I never felt the need to buy expansions.

RATING: N/A
Chess with a fantasy theme... ok, so it's not really like chess it all. It's just that you've got this board and these pieces with different abilities that you're trying to get across to the other side. There's no real luck and there are lots of possible moves to consider. Games I've played have gone way over an hour because the players want to think their moves through as the decision tree is quite deep so I don't see the 60 minute time estimate that's on the box as reality. I do see that this is an excellent game... especially for those that enjoy fantasy themes such as myself.

RATING: 6
A nice two-player game where you have to enter the dungeon on one side of the play area and exit on the other one in order to win. The gameplay is fast-paced, the mechanics are fun and rage-inducting as you are able to rotate the different tiles of the map and thus hinder your opponent's plans. The miniatures are nicely crafted but it can be a while until you familiarize yourself with the different skills each unit has, and about each artifact you can use.

насилу уговорил Лиду сыграть второй раз. говорит, что игра скучная, мрачная и завязана на лабиринтах, да ещё и вращающихся. голову сломать можно, пытаясь представить все эти вращения квадратов (с учётом стен, пропастей и т.п.). 

в общем, немного напрягаюсь в ожидании уже заказанной "Клаустрофобии". 

хотел попробовать соло, как Лида уйдёт на йогу, но почитал правила... много труда вложено (целая отдельная книжка и куча специальных компонентов для соло-игры), но слишком долго разбираться. слишком унылый шипастый сеттинг. боты действуют по открытому алгоритму. 

устаревшая механика действий (нужно играть карты генерации AP)

Great 2-player strategy game. The components are really good and the box has space for the expansions. The game is luck-free and requires a lot of planning. Can easily cause AP to the players. The rules are simple but each character and equipment has its own abilities. I liked the tutorial scenarios that introduce the rules a step at a time. Its more complex than chess and has some minor bluffing elements in combat. The game requires a dedicated partner.
The high fantasy theme might not appeal to everyone.

Excellent "chess-like game" with 0% luck involved. You'll need a timer to avoid too long downtimes, because there is so much to take care of! Enormous tactic and strategy involved in all phases of the game.

Solitaire is a whole new game in the same box. This puzzle game is maybe the most overwhelming i own, The AI is the most clever i've seen so far, and the game just plays well, while very difficult. More "luck-based" in the layout than the two players version, but it's necessary to improve the replayability, which is huge.

Wanted to love this for what it is, but it turned out to be too much work for the fun. Too many fiddly components spoilt the broth for me. The fact that I could play another game like LOTR: Confrontation and get a similar experience, in a much shorter time and with MUCH less hassle, finally killed this off for me.

RATING: 8
I’ve played the full game now and this is awesome. There is so much to think about and so many options. Also there is lots of room for clever tactical play. I’m itching to open the expansions now. 

*Ended up selling this great game*

Dungeon Twister used to be my ultimate 2 player duel. I became disillusioned with it though. The decisions in Dungeon Twister were interesting and it is a great game but the time it took to play including set-up and tear down became unacceptable. The decision/time ratio just wasn't worth it for me. Plus, what added to the problem was the length of time between plays meant it always needed a full rules read through before every game. The rules aren't tough or take much learning but there are enough of them to make it more than just a quick skim read. 

I sold it on but missed it. I think Shazamm! has now filled that void for me. What it lacks in depth it more than makes up for in play time.

I only have this Dungeon Twister, but it feels like there's not much variety of characters, most of them do nothing remarkable, maybe the first dungeon twister characters were more original.
Regarding the objects, you can find and use during the game, they are very very very limited, and don't add any interest to the game, there's no "I want to get to that object before my opponent does" kind of competition, instead there's "oh I'm passing through an object, since I'm not carring anything I'll grab it" kinda feeling... sucks!
I don't like the fact that wounded characters simply cant move at all and can do nothing else but defend themselfs if attacked. I think they should still be able to move, but less than if unwounded.
But the design is interesting, there's no luck, maybe with some expansions it will turn out an excelent game.

On paper it showed a lot of promise, I thought I would like it, but unfortunately it didn't turn that way and it feels boring to me. Actually I haven't even played a full game, just the first tutorial scenario a couple of times but I don't think it would've been any better. When in a mood for an abstract strategy I would rather play something more compact in form and rules, yes this actually have a theme so technically it's not an abstract strategy but it feels like one.

Initial Impression: Unfortunately, I only managed to talk my son into playing through the first 3 tutorial missions before we traded this game away. Having not had much experience with the game, I haven't managed to form a solid opinion. From what I can remember of the game, we weren't too excited by it. The game felt almost chesslike in the pieces' movements and combat felt a touch too deterministic. The tile rotation didn't seem to add much to the overall experience. Perhaps if we'd given the game a few more plays it would have grown on us but sadly we gave up and moved on.

I like this game but only because i love chess and this is just a game that plays a twist on the classic chess game.  It will make players think more than most games out there so be prepared.

The solo game is absolutely top notch and is one of the best solo Boardgames out there today.

I'd played Dungeon Twister: The Card Game and liked the ideas, but disliked the fact that it was hard to see where everything was located.  This game is better in every respect than the card game and I can't see myself playing the card game again.  It can get quite involved and recognizing how to twist the Dungeon rooms in your favor feels like the key to the game (which I haven't figured out yet).  It's chess-like with a lot of fantasy theme and twists and turns.

A puzzle game disguised as a dungeon crawl.  I enjoy playing it and am disappointed that I didn't get the last three expansions in French since it looks like they will never be released in English and are now out of print.

The minis are nice and the components match up well with the original releases. I didn't find the cards to be a poor quality. A little thin, maybe, but still usable and they feel like the will stand up over tine since they aren't shuffled.

From now on, I will record playings using the characters in the original release not included in [i]Prison[/i] as using an expansion.

Finally played this. It's as awesome as the most raving review raves. Would love to seriously delve into this and learn it inside and out, as there is obviously so much depth here. Every game takes only 10-20 minutes, and one wrong move could easily be your last, if your opponent is clever enough to capitalize.
Giving it a tentative 9, looking forward to getting enough play in to warrant an even higher grade.

RATING: 5
What the... I don't even...  What is the intention here?  Something cool could be done with rotating rooms but this is not it.  Every mechanism in the game is tortuous; in particular choosing your action points and the combat.  I feel like it could have been simplified and been about navigating the dungeon with the most skill.  Instead it takes turns to do anything cool because of how it artificially limits your actions.

Rated 10 because I love the series.

This one is a stand alone, or can act as an expansions. 
Solo variant is alright, but this game is great with another player. 

Miniatures are a nice touch but unnecessary. Seems like future expansions will not have them (if they ever get released), and it just increases the cost of this game.

Total carnage. The games are close, there is a lot of action and a lot of fun. In all my games the combat cards a were used up or almost used up. It makes the end game much tighter. I like the new characters, especially the telepath.

Just as the original Dungeon Twister this is an excellent game. I would give a score of "10" as DT is "The Game" for me however I have to deduct 2 points due to the poor quality of some of the components and to the fact that I still prefer cardboard standups compare to unpainted minis.

Otro gran descubrimiento gracias a Marc. Manejas una serie de personajes, cada uno con habilidades y características propias, que se enfrentan al equipo contrario en una carrera por obtener puntos de victoria, que se consiguen eliminando un adversario o saliendo del tablero por la linea contraria. El tablero es modular y está compuesto por ocho habitaciones que pueden girar, lo que aporta un grado de complejidad al juego interesante, puesto que cada habitación es un minilaberinto, con diversos obstáculos.
Muy recomendable.

Fabulous fantasy chess-like brain-burner game with miniatures. A very deeply tactical game with deep strategical choices who rewards player [u]skill[/u]. A game with a low lucky factor and a huge replay value. A game of carefully planning and maneuvering. It has intense interaction, offering several paths to victory. Every game is different, full of suspense and memorable! Very balanced characters, each having a strong and a weak side.
Two manuals: one for 2 player games and one for [color=red]solitaire[/color] games. A solitaire session plays different, it more like a blend of a dungeon crawler and a tactical miniature game. The game provides one of the best solitaire experiences!
We play with the discarded combat cards face-up, so we didn't need to memorize the opponent's discarded cards.
I made cardboard stands-up similar to DT1-style to replace the plastic miniatures and to mix them with the figures from DT1 and expansions.

Played a few times with my wife. Good game (she always wins, seems to be a theme with us) it always burns my brain. The components however are sub-par. I am not normally one to complain about components cutting my teeth into gameing with hex and counter wargames, but for this one irks me. I think it is the fact that they tried to present the components as being of a higher quality than they were. That and the fact that the cards to the game (a key component) are so frail that I can not see the game standing up to repeated plays.

The solitaire mode of this game is some of the best and most brilliantly designed I've ever seen - and gets some massive bonus points because of it.

However, this game loses some points because I don't agree with exclusive promos - and this game has a bunch of them.

Update: Despite the solo mode, just wasn't playing it much; sold it.

I don't understand why this game is classified as an expansion for my ratings.  It is not an expansion.

RATING: 5
Dungeon Twister is a very interesting two player game.  Each player controls 8 characters and 6 items each.  The goal is running your characters to your opponents end line through the labyrinth or killing your opponents characters (through card driven combat ala LoTR Confrontation/AGoT).  The labyrinth is not fully known until it's explored and once it's been explored the orientation of the rooms traps, open passages, and locked doors can be altered by twisting the rooms.  Sounds like a thrilling dungeon crawl?  Not really.  It's feels more like playing an abstract strategy game, though I do feel like the designer did a good job on the theme.  After all of the rooms are revealed there is literally no luck in the game and it's this luckless battle of wits that makes it feel like an abstract game.

The game is not completely devoid of luck/randomness/chaos.  At the beginning players will secretly arrange 4 characters on their end line and put their remaining 4 characters and item tokens on the face-down dungeon tiles.  Once this is done the players use action points to reveal rooms, move in the labyrinth and start combat.  The initial orientation of the room is random and this can play a big part in how the game plays out.  When a player reveals a room he places everything in the room, how he wants with the exception of his own items.  This is where the randomness of the tile orientation can suck.  If I have a bruiser revealing a tile that's next to him, but there is a wall between him and the revealed tile, I wouldn't be able to place my opponents squishy character next to him and start combat.  This sounds good but then maybe my opponent reveals a room and there is an opening to the newly revealed tile and he's able to do this.  There are other ways in which the chaos can take the enjoyment out of the game a bit.

With the expandability of this game and the way it works, it's basically the miniatures game I've always been looking for, without the crazy high price tag.  If you're going to try this game I would like to pass on a word of advice: both the games rulebook and I strongly recommend that you use a timer as so that the game stays within a manageable time frame.  

[b]Dungeon Twister Prison[/b]:  This section is to talk about the differences between Dungeon Twister (DT1 for future reference) and Dungeon Twister Prison (DTP for future reference).  It should be noted that these game are not only base games but also expand one another.  All of the expansions for Dungeon Twister will work with either game.  It should be noted that I think the original Dungeon Twister is a better value for your money and a better entry point to the Dungeon Twister universe.

This game is a lot more expensive than DT1.  DTP is $64 vs DT1's $26 at one online store.  What does this extra money buy you?  You get standard magic-sized cards compared to DT1's mini-cards (ala Arkham Horror items).  You get plastic mini's with really nice sculpts vs. DT1's cardboard stand-ups.  This last point is kind of a non-issue for me as I always just use the tokens instead of stand-ups or mini's.  DTP comes in a much larger box.  This extra box space is filled with a nice insert which allows the storage of future expansions.  Finally, it gives you the components and rules necessary to play the solo version of the game.  It should be noted that these solo components are not compatible with DT1.  In conclusion I think you get a lot more game for your money with DT1.  Beyond that, if you compare the components of DTP with another Asmodee game by the name of Claustrophobia, which are of similar cost, Claustrophobia smokes DTP in the worst kind of way.  Yes, I consider DTP to be the superior game to Claustrophobia, but way to drop the ball with the components when you do a side by side comparison.

As for the mix of characters and tiles, they're interesting.  I do feel that the mix of characters in DTP has the potential exemplify the negative aspect of the  'luck/chaos/whatever' involved with room reveals more so than the originals.  How so?  Colossus can kill most characters it gets near with the exception of another Colossus.  The Telepath can kill most characters it gets next to with the exception of the Colossus and another Telepath.  If you reveal a room with containing your Banshee and an ANY opponent character and one trap, you can likely outright kill (not even wound) an opponents character for 2 action points.  If it weren't for the room reveal chaos, I think that this would be a stronger set of characters and items than DT1.

I have read the rules for DTP's solo game and they sound interesting.  After having played the solo game I can say with certainty it's very interesting but unfortunately you spend more time activating the AI/NPCS than actually playing your own turn.  This to me feels unacceptable.  In addition, I feel there's a good chance of incorrectly activating the AI.  This would work well in a digital format where a computer actually resolves the AI, but it's too much work in a board game format.  Thankfully for video gamers Dungeon Twister is being done in a digital format and hopefully the solo option will be available

I like Dungeon Twister, and this is an improvement over the original, both in component quality and in implementation.  I like that the box is bigger, to accommodate goodies already owned, or future expansions, even though I'm not thrilled that there is a bit of overlap from the previous version of the game.  The boards themselves are more closed off and difficult to navigate then the original game, as it is a prison.

Contrary to what you might expect from the theme this is not a typical dungeon crawler. Instead, it is a no-luck knife fight with serious AP potential.

Both players have an identical set of characters and items, and the goal is to be the first to score 5 points by either killing your opponent's fighters or moving your own across the board into the enemy's starting zone.

The characters all have different special abilities, and can often exploit certain features of the dungeon to their advantage (e.g. the mage can levitate across pits). The dungeon itself consists of randomly placed parts which are revealed only when a character goes to explore them. Perhaps the most defining dungeon feature is that all dungeon parts have a tile that allows a character to rotate them which can rapidly change the dungeon layout, open up new or close down existing passages, and quickly move characters elsewhere. This is where most of the brain-burning comes in.

Pretty complicated game to win. I've played it solo once and really liked the way the artificial intelligence of the game worked with the cards. These AI cards play a priority order based on what is around them. Rooms rotate and a multitude of possible chess like moves will be required to keep yourself from getting stomped by the game. I found it a bit difficult to read the numbers on the miniatures, and the game is a bit fiddly.

Gran juego de estrategia. Como si fuera un ajedrez en un mundo de fantasía y con gran número de posibilidades de juego.

RATING: 8
Even though the game is almost 100% tactical, it still manages to feel chaotic since there are so many factors to consider, and so many ways to get derailed by the opponent.  This makes strategy difficult if not impossible at times. I could see this getting better with further plays and more skill on both sides.

RATING: 6
Played one solo game.  Dense rulebooks but the game must have been play-tested to death to ensure an appropriate balance and solo playability. 

Second solo game, won 5-1.  Not so hard...was I doing something wrong?

Ok, so I made the critical mistake of NOT discarding my combat cards after use.  This makes the game MUCH harder.  Just when you think you're close to winning, a bunch of boards are revealed, new monsters come onto the board, and they make a break for the exits, leaving you madly chasing them.  Great balancing mechanism forcing you to fight sometimes, and run at others.

Colossus is ridiculously powerful and almost makes winning too easy.  I find myself relying hugely on just him.

A fantasy brainburner. The combination of heavy tactics and strategy with the cool theme works really well for me. However, I'm still not sure about some of the aspects this game. At times it feels really too chaotic to plan properly. On the other hand, interesting, tough decisions are plentiful.

Hopefully the rating will improve with familiarity. I have played this once solo and it took me 2.5 hours, yet the game only lasted six turns! It was quite fiddly, but I can definitely see that there is a great game there and that becoming more aware of the rules will greatly reduce play time.

RATING: 8
It has to be taken on its own terms--namely, as a tactical optimization puzzle. On those terms, and with its veneer of a fantasy theme, Dungeon Twister succeeds beautifully. This edition, with its nifty figures and surprisingly successful solitaire system, is a great relaunch of the system. The numerous expansions are also a plus, though I am irrationally perturbed that the minis and standups will clash.

After the introductory scenarios you have to use the suggested time-limit though.. because the longer you think the better your move gets.. & then people just start thinking 10 min. about their move (analysis-paralysis) & no one enjoys playing anymore.

RATING: 6
The game is beautiful, the idea is good, but the AP is ridiculous! Understand me, I'm not saying that it isn't a nice game. Actually, Dungeon Twister has all the ingredients to be a awesome game: you control incredible creatures, they'll fight with each other, you have to escape from a prison, the are items that you could use... But in terms of planning your actions it's worst than chess. You'll have to think four, five rounds forward (and there are more things to thinking about than chess). If it were simpler, it would be better.

I had high hopes for Dungeon Twister, but what I war really looking for was more like what Summoner Wars turned out to be: lots of options with some customization potential.

This is a great 2 players game! I love the miniatures that come with this new version. I think the new objects and characters improve a little the gameplay over the original game. The speed potion is gone for good and I approve as it was so overpowered! The arrow slits add a new whole level of tactis.

This game is still very hard for me but I enjoy it a lot!

Totally recommend it if you like to think hard and think long!

Dungeon Twister is my favorite game EVER, so it is natural that I also like Prison, a very similar game. In fact, Dungeon Twister: Prison is one of the handful of games I’m currently rating a 10. This is easily my favorite game of 2009 but it is not eligible to be part of the “official” list.

I don’t have anything bad to say about it. Perhaps I prefer to play with the cardboard stands (they don’t hide objects and it is so much cheaper) of previous editions, but I really like how the board looks with the minis so I’m torn about this issue. Love the replayability and customization (with the expansions) available to the game. Also it is very hard to play well in only two minutes per turn. A true gamer´s game (heavy brain burner) with very low luck. I love it.

My favorite character of this edition is the Naga. It moves a lot and can take advantage of the new slits feature. Lots of possibilities there.

I have never played the solo variant. I,m not much of a solo player but I’m curious of it so perhaps I will do it in the future. Prison components are top notch (except for the thin cards).

On the other hand, I’m very sad that the game appears to be stalled right now. Prison was supposed to be a new beginning with lots of expansions to come (and I would have bought them all) but Dungeon Twister: Traps, although announced, never hit the market. I really REALLY hope they see the light of day.

As of today, DT had a successful crowfunding campaign to develop it on tablets. I tried to help but for some reason I could not pledge in Ulule, however I will buy the game for the iPad when it comes out.

One of 2009´s favorites.

I've rated the 1st edition DT a 10 and with this second edition DT2, including a worthy Solo variant, I would give it a solid 11!.  The enclosed rulebook and progressive scenarios are clear and very well thought out, while the art/graphics is exceptional!  

Regarding the Solo variant, 'Actions' are determined by the APs allocated to/and within a given character's six objectives in order of priority.  This may then be followed by a strict observation to 'Proximity' (minimalist) rules.  Of the 32 NPC cards, there are 4 different character types of each of the 8 characters possessing unique card attributes... all things considered, Brilliant!

The Solo variant alone is well worth owning this game.  Highly recommended!

A chess-like brainburner in the trappings of D&D. This is one of those that I will happily devote myself to, improving my skill at the way I would Chess and Go... it's that deep of a game. I think it will also appeal to those who like tactical skirmish games, so it has an interesting intersection of potential players, united by a love of fantasy theme and details.

It is a deep game with high replay variability. Beautiful miniatures. The amount of thought they've put into the solo AI is awesome. One warning about the rules, they are missing/ambiguous on a few points so download a copy of the base game rules as well. But, I like the tutorial method of easing people into the game with scenarios of increasing complexity, nice idea.

Unique in its ability to both be a strategic brain burner, but also to "tell a story" along with the best of Ameritrash.  Like for example my Mechan-Orc who courageously carried a wounded Colossus through 4 rooms, jumping 3 times over pit traps, only to finally be felled by a bow-wielding Cleric and a Backstabber.

Level 1 (Pink, easiest): 2-1

Same basic rating as DT but a half point higher for superior presentation and out-of-the-box solo rules (which I haven't used yet). The insert is particularly, maybe excessively, nice and well thought out. Gameplay is the same as with DT1, although the character and item mix has been adjusted, perhaps to reduce the number of weird or complicated rules situations for the new player. Speaking of, while the revised rulebook is clearer and cleaner, and while it is well indexed, the tutorial format (especially since the rules don't clearly distinguish the training scenarios from the surrounding rules) means that its usefulness as a reference for experienced players is much diminished. The character mix is pretty good; the absence of a thief does cut down on the weird pit trap situations. The items are a bit odd mix-wise; two items (bow, telescoping spear) create somewhat unwieldy ranged, close combat, and group combat situations. There's also no treasure; that and the missing goblin (also worth an extra VP for getting out of the dungeon) means that there are fewer quick ways to score some points. The 15-60-minute putative play time is misleading to new players, who are likely to see 90+ minute full-game sessions.

It's hard not to compare this to Descent, and not just because of the striking ambient similarities: both involve tactical positioning on a square-grid with obstacles, different characters with stats and special abilities, and scenarios with varying board layouts and victory conditions. Of course, there are many differences as well. Twister has no character advancement, comparatively little equipment gathering, no die-rolling, and a prominent element of board manipulation. Importantly, there's no game master, but you play one on one. In fact the level of gaminess found here could put off people expecting a dungeon crawl emulation. Extensive examination of the game state and analysis of endless permutations of offensive and defensive actions [i]will[/i] be rewarded; if you attempt to play this purely intuitively you will constantly find yourself needing just one more step, one more action. Still, it's probably this aspect which could provide the game with lasting value as a developing struggle of wits, and I doubt Descent can match that. As a final comment, use of the fireball wand seems too swingy. As a final final comment, the tea label VP counters are kind of funny.

The most AP prone game I've ever played. Rating based on this game without a clock, probably with a clock things moves better and with lots of mistakes...

After all, the concentration will be everything to make most with the time you have.

RATING: 9
This basically felt like another expansion because I had already owned and played the original base set.  Overall, I prefer the character set from the original base set.  And I strongly prefer cardboard standees to an incomplete (because only this set comes with minis) set of unpainted miniatures.  I guess I could try to purchase sets of miniatures for all the different expansions I own for this game, but that would be a headache, especially considering the time it would take to paint them.  I made my own set of cardboard standees from the images available in the images section for the game here on the 'Geek. The names are in French, but I can handle that. 
Anyway, the solo game is a decent way to learn how to play, but not particularly fun for me personally.  I'm not a solo gamer, so no surprise, but generally it felt like performing the actions for 5-7 non-player-characters just wasn't all that exciting, especially as many of them just ran around opening portcullises, picking up items and revealing rooms.  That, to me, is not exciting to be forced to ghost play.  
So, it's a worthwhile way to get into the system, but not nearly as great of a value as the original base set, especially considering that you'll need to make your own standees if you want uniformity with all the other sets.

Remek játék, nagyon tetszik az absztrakt és a tematikus jellege is. A kivitelezés is szép, remek a hangulata. Elég komolyan kell és lehet tervezni. Sok helyen olvastam, hogy nem szeretik a szabálykönyvet, de szerintem meg remek ez a bevezető jelleg, hogy küldetéseken keresztül tanítja meg a teljes szabályrendszert. Igazából ha elsőre az összes szabályt el kellene mondani valakinek, az nem kevés, és így azért elég jó ötlet ez a fokozatosság.

Rules are poorly laid out in this version as 'intro' scenarios, which is quite a problem if you don't already know them by heart. And my personal taste remains with the cardboard stand-ups as opposed to the miniatures here (but that's not to say the minis aren't good quality, just unnecessary and don't add to the game). Otherwise, a great strategy game, when with the right players.

Very nice quality bits, but not perfect.  The good: easy to punch out, great art, nice sculpts, sturdy components, great insert.  The bad: graphics on the tokens could be more "centered".  The OK: the minis were bent, but it was very easy to put them back in place (near boiling water for 5-60 seconds, then removed with a glove, given the right shape, and dipped in cold water).

Rules quite well done.  I like the progressive approach (tutorial scenarios).

Excellent eurogame take on the dungeon crawl theme. No  randomness besides the initial room/dungeon layout. High in both strategy and tactics, with relatively simple basic rules but high replayability and emergent depth from the interaction of the different character's capabilities constant decisions, each of which always feels critical. Suitable and well-executed theme that naturally fits the mechanics though the fluff back-story is a bit strained. Play times from 45--90 minutes, depending on tardiness of players.

This is weird, twisty fun. I would call it silly fantasy chess, but that makes it sound boring when in fact it's fun.

It's a wild, silly, random, dungeon-fighting smackdown with a goodly amount of fun to boot. The creative initial placement rules allow for some interesting surprises. The rules are easy to grasp. And the tile rotation (which I suspect will turn out to be the key strategy with repeat plays) adds a really unique element that helps make it fun.

Overall, I like it more than I expected.

This is a LOW priority acquisition, because I have the original version and didn't feel like the "upgrades" were significant. So it would have to be a throw-in.

This fun, well-designed game is all strategy and tactics--no luck.
If AP drags out a game, you could use a timer.

The solo rules are fantastic, and the game includes a ton of components made just for the solo version. This is worth buying for the solo version alone.

Great recoming of an old game. With miniatures this game looks a lot better and the gameplay is somehow a lot more varying than in base game. Poor quality miniatures and cards but cardboard is a lot better.

Solo rules are awesome, btw!

Love the update to miniatures. Dungeon Twister's combination of brain burn and fantasy chaos is my cup of tea.

This comes with Paladins & Dragons and Fire & Water expansions.

The minis have been painted, some better than others.  I can send pics.

A chess-like game. So you must be prepared to play it :)
But very clever and challenging.

Solitaire option is very good, random a little but still very very challenging (especially as you are losing combat cards)

We played immediately by the full rules and know I understand why there is a tutorial :s; Diserves it's high rating, lots of room for analysis paralysis though

I think I actually prefer the base characters in DT2 to the mix in the original, despite never having seen a banshee scream-kill.

Update, August 2015 -- I have finally screamed an enemy character into a pit trap.

RATING: 8
Nice and simple game. The action point system works pretty well. The only drawback is that it seems that the way the pieces were designed to carry the items around does not work really well when you have to move around other pieces or when trying to slide your piece over a tile separation. I gotta give them kudos for trying, but you will find out that moving pieces or tiles does feel a bit clunky. Then again, this is a board game and you can just go so far. Lastly, I have seen plenty of video games that have similar features and kind of take care of the mechanical aspect. I do like the miniatures and I do prefer to play with live people, but I can't but feel this is one of those games that is probably better suited for the electronic realm than the physical one.

RATING: 7.5
Won the game in a writing contest. Resembles chess and can be quite entertaining. It is old school and there are a few more rules than necessary, but you can get used to them after a few games. The game experience got better by playing the game. 

Painted the wonderful minis - quite good considering the age of the game.

RATING: 9
One of the best, most brutal 2-player experience if you can handle losing ONLY because of your decisionmaking. No randomness whatsoever (except for board setup, which is seldomly giving one player an edge). On a randomness scale from 1 to Space Hulk, this is -100.

Thougts after two plays: Very tense game with lots of possibilites. Time-limit stopps AP which is against some opponents necessary. Really good tactical game, but I need to play it much more.

RATING: 7
Dungeon Twister is much, much more than a Dungeon crawler.
Luck is almost excluded from the game.
DT Prison adds solo rules and very nice figurines and serves as base game of a new series (totally compatible with the preceding DT expansions).
Chris Boelinger, the designer, has crafted a very clever concept.
However, the learning curve is very steep.
As I am not fond of chess, my first enthusiasm decreased - but it still is a very intelligent concept,

RATING: 8
I've never played the original DT (this remake was out before I got into gaming), but I have found DT2 at least to be an excellent 2-player game - although themed as a dungeon-crawler, and doing a good job of bringing out this atmosphere, it plays not too differently from an abstract like chess, albeit with some random elements and a wonderful card-based combat mechanic which introduces elements of bluffing and trying to out-think your opponent. Sadly I never get to play it as my wife is my only regular 2-player gaming partner, and this isn't really her kind of game - but at least she doesn't hate the game, and I have managed to get a few games in (although none since at least 2013). One of many games in my collection that I really want to explore more (I suspect this could be a 9 or 10 if I could play it enough to confirm how good it is), but probably won't get to due to lack of opportunities to play, as well as new games coming out to grab my attention.

I have played the solo game a few times in the past too - and found it pretty challenging. But I no longer have time for, or enjoy, playing board games solo.

I think this game excites me because its a unique form of a Dungeon crawl.  This particular game now has plastic peices which are a bonus.

Never played it myself but I did teach it to a newcomer at GASP 2011. I'm still a fan of the first edition with my custom made wooden frame.

RATING: 6
I liked it, but not as much as the original game.  I felt that the characters were note quite as interestingly balanced -- the colossus seems to dominate the game, and misfortune surrounding him via tile reveals or fireballs can make the game very one sided.  In contrast, in the original gate-smasher and big combat were separated, so  you could evade the enemy big hitter or fight their ability to smash gates.  A mobile high combat unit, even at low speed, undermines the core mechanics of the game and has too few answers.  Now, that doesn't ruin the game, but it overshadows the awesomeness that was in the original and removes at lot of the labyrinth feel to the game.

Also, the minis are not useful -- the move/combat reminders are too hard to see, so I ended up immediately going back to the chits.  The minis were not functional and were aesthetically jarring since nothing else was 3d.

05-06-2014. Rated after 1 play. Commented a couple of months after playing. Dungeon Twister is a fun game in which you basically try to kill/outrun your opponent. It's quite puzzly, but fun.

I really don't understand the move to plastic. The game worked perfectly as cardboard standups and counters - I think I actually prefered the old artwork. It was so characterful and fun. This is just a bit dissapointing.

The game's as good though, and I suppose it deserves some Kudos for getting me into the wonderful game of Dungeon Twister.

Has all the wonderful analysis-paralysis of chess without having to learn anything by heart.  I love to play it, although I can't find an opponent: it's much longer then stated, I can't even imagine playing with a 2-minute turn limit, as you do so much more in a single turn then in chess.

I liked the game but couldn't justify keeping it around when the price had gone up so high and we rarely play it. Melani was lukewarm towards it and so we sold it away. 
I highly recommend the game and hope they reprint it in a normal sized box and my wife slightly recommends it but recognizes that it needs time and plays to really sink in.

One of my favorite games and my most favorite solo game ever.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Abstract strategy disguised as a dungeon-crawl. I'm a little ambivalent about the combat system, and think this could have been streamlined more into a traditional breakout from twisting rooms. Feels like a brilliant idea (rotating rooms) adulterated by a litany of character, object rules and a dry, ill-fitting combat system that seems out of place (since usually you'd be blocked by enemy pieces or jump over).

But one cannot discount the grand ambition of the design, and I think I might come around after trying more scenarios and getting more comfortable with the different abilities. The game is a brain-melter, combining the most AP-inducing spatial strategy (rotations) with the most AP-inducing modern concept (budgeting of action points), and asks you to please keep it to 2-minute turns, thank you. Each turn is like  a shitstorm in your head, in a good way. And when you pull off a killer move, it is satisfyingly grand, often involving a couple of rotating rooms that suddenly open up threats and possibilities in positions previously thought safe.

Think it best to stick to the suggestion to not let players rotate rooms to visualize (more fun when they commit to the move, and... oh shit).

 I was interested in playing this after hearing Tom Vasel talk it up so much on the Dice Tower, but I'm glad I never actually went out and bought it. I dunno.. it's not terrible, and maybe it's not fair that I'm judging it after only one play, but I really don't feel like playing it again so that's all it's going to get. Maybe with more expansions and character choices it's good but.. eh. I'm sure there's more to it than what I saw, but I didn't even move three of my characters off the starting line. I'm also sure "seasoned" players would have murdered me and shown me that there's a ton of strategy and you really have to think about what you're doing and blah, blah, blah. It just didn't click for me. I don't want to explore deeper strategy because I'd rather play something I find inherently fun. Add on that the pain of rotating the tiles and.. whatever. Reading the rules actually made me wary of the game.. I don't know why but everything about the game put me off. I think a lot of it had to do with the art. I HATE the art in this game.. it's terrible. I'm sure it's a case of me pre-judging the game from the look of it, but I just couldn't get past my gut feeling that I wasn't going to like the game. It's just not for me.

RATING: 7
since this is a scenario based game that I've only played one scenario of, and it has a slight learning curve, I'm not sure what to think of this yet, but I'm intrigued.

Interesting game -- shares more in common with a puzzle game or an abstract strategy game than the tactical dungeon crawl it looks like. But the double-blind combat cards and the variable action selection adds a human element that makes it a little less dry.

Only a few good moves, and totally unforgiving! Every single one of your actions must be well-thought out and efficient, and you should probably look several moves ahead to play this well.

Игрушка больше всего напоминающая мне шахматы. Красивая, со множеством тактик. Мой выбор в категории "игра для двоих". Как и шахматы потребует внимательности и сосредоточенности. Кроме планирования есть случайность, которая всегда подчиняется игроку. Лучше сыграть в эту игрушку, чем читать о ней, благо партия занимает 30-45 мин. Миниатюрки хоть и гнуться, но это нельзя назвать минусом - они не сломаются, а погнутые всегда можно исправить. Организатор хоть и немного хлипковат, но для своих задач его более, чем достаточно. Итого 5+ от меня (с надеждой, что продолжения будут не менее хороши, чем оригинал).

Wow!!!  I am SERIOUSLY impressed with what they've done with this game!  After trying a few different games solo in the past, I eventually came to the conclusion that playing board games on my own isn't fun and pretty much defeats the purpose.  And then I read the rules for solo play with this game.  Pure.  GENIUS.  I can't believe that they have managed to "program" the game so that you don't have to make any decisions for the non-player side.  The system, while it's not simple per se, is quite intuitive, and they've even managed to include half a dozen difficulty levels without adding any rules!  But it's not all about the solo game - the new characters and items are a lot of fun too (I'm glad they included a ranged weapon!).  And the figures!  What fantastic sculpts!!  Now I regret not having splurged on the original game's 3D figures.  These new ones are definitely worthy of spending many hours applying paint to them - it should be a fun project.  And I'm delighted that they included a rulebook that allows players to learn this game in stages.  "Dungeon Twister" was a very difficult game to introduce to first-time players due to the amount of information that had to be grasped in order to learn the game and due to the fact that a new player doesn't stand a chance against an experienced one.  But the new rules make this game much more approachable now, for which I'm very grateful!  So all in all, while the base game isn't altered very much (other than with the solo play, of course), this game has earned a rare perfect 5 for game design thanks to a combination of brilliant rules and fantastic components.  Game design: 5/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 9/10

RATING: 7.5
Interesting system. The claims of no luck disregard the (substantial) luck in starting positions, but it still rewards analysis better than just about anything else set in a dungeon. There's plenty of scope for varying tactics and clever tricks, and the combat cards are [i]so[/i] much better than dice. This is a very good game.

Speaking specifically of Dungeon Twister 2, the miniatures are surprisingly excellent, though frustratingly difficult to integrate with characters from the expansions. I still haven't played the solo game.

Got a quite good solitaire game, but loses out on the fact it uses miniatures rather than the superb colourful and informational cardboard figures and stands.

Because of that, it can't really be used with the other Dungeon Twister games. Unless you just use the counters.

Sigh. Anytime I see something like [geekurl=/image/1135084/dungeon-twister-2-prison]this[/geekurl], I know it's not going to be my kind of game. Seriously, women characters in leather bikinis as body armour? It's as though the 80's never ended.

I like the idea of the combat, but it just didn't seem to click here and works much more effectively in LoTR: Confrontation. The rotating tiles seemed to have very little effect in a game where that appears to be the gimmick on which it is sold...

I can't understand the comments about low-quality miniatures. Given they are more bent than the snakemen in this edition can dream of :P But this is fixed in less than 15 minutes and the things that are important for me in a miniature are very good here.

An interesting game for sure! There was very little luck in the game. There was a lot to take in for my first game. I found some of the features (traps) to be annoying rather than fun challenge. There was almost too many options and things to consider. I felt like there were too many distractions rather than raw strategy. Also, the game was a little long.  With that being said, I would play it again to give it another chance.

Solo game is great. I couldn't get any takers for the previous 2 player incarnation so the solo ability of this version made a second purchase viable.

Nice and intricate gameplay. Thankfully doesn't feel much like chess which I was worried about, more like a puzzle - a very thematic puzzle. 

Keep shifting between 8 and 9 on this one.

Dungeon Twister is a strategy game for two players. You control a team of eight adventurers with varied and necessary abilities. Your objective: to escape from the Dungeon.
\13\\13\
Unfortunately, in front of you lies a vast labyrinth of dangerous rooms which can rotate thanks to the astonishing mechanisms constructed by dwarves. These deadly traps and twistings to prevent you from escaping would be enough of a challenge by themselves, but you also face another group of adventurers with the same goal as yourself. Without relying on dice, Dungeon Twister calls upon all of your tactics and strategies, your ability to bluff, your anticipation of the danger and your management of combat and action cards.

RATING: N/A
Played through 1.5 tutorials, so I don't think it's fair to rate yet. (I REALLY like the tutorial idea for teaching the game.)

I don't normally care about art in games, but it bothers me here, both because I don't care for how dark it is personally (which is not a knock for everyone) and because I don't find it to be particularly functional (which is). The reason I only played half of the second tutorial was that my opponent and I had missed a couple of pit traps that blended with the background, and that significantly altered the course of the game, so we decided it was better to give up than try to finish. I don't understand why those couldn't have been some unused color to help them stand out, or at least uniform across tiles.

As for the gameplay itself, I really liked a lot of things about it, but fear that it would take hours to play with most of the people I play with (and I don't want to use a timer; that wouldn't be fun for us). My current guess numerically is a low 8; I would enjoy this, but not as much as some other two-player games that are shorter. (Which is too bad, as reviews made me think this might be something that had favorite-game-of-all-time potential for me.)

I thought the original game deserved high marks for a fun and strategic dungeon romp with an aim to escape.  I thought this was just a rehash of that but my hat's off to Asmodee for putting out a version that's backward compatible with all the previous stuff as well as adding the solo functional playability which is the icing on this version.  Worth getting for the solo version alone.  Despite the fact that I'm not a fan of the minis and prefer the cardboard stand-ups, I still give this one high marks.

Fantastic game! I love Dungeon Twister, but it's heavy, and with very little luck. This version is the best entry point to the game - get it now!

The rules step you through learning the game with five scenarios that ramp up in difficulty and length of play, until you're playing the full game and have mastered all the rules. The rules are also very well written, with few grammar mistakes, and include everything you could want. The solitaire rules, and rules for veterans of the game that want to play their old expansions with the new set, are especially nice touches.

The components are on the whole very nice. The box has a great insert to sort everything in, the miniatures are very nicely detailed, although bent out of shape out of the box (do the hot water/cold water trick to fix them). I recommend sleeving the cards in premium sleeves, such as Dragon Shields, as they are very flimsy.

Fantastic package overall! This might end up being rated a "10" if I can get in some regular 2-player games.

Fun 2-players game, full of strategy and bluff. I wish it was made for multiplayer, though. I need to play it more.

Same as Dungeon twister, but with miniatures and solo play rules. Still a great brainbuster and tactical awesomness. This game is not light since it has 0% luck, it's all about skill. So it can feel a bit exhausting to play.

This game is excellent.  I am thoroughly impressed with how well it plays solo, but I equally enjoy playing against an opponent.

Because India fascinates me. Some of my greatest friends have been Indian. I will always remember the wonderful presentation First Sgt Khan put on for me when I was mayor.  He then drove 8 hours to visit me in the hospital. Later he and his wife hosted my family for many dinners. One time his wife forgot that we aren’t regulars of authentic Indian cuisine and handed me a bowl of ... something. I can’t say what it was because it singed my tastebud and later my bowels. THAT WAS INSANELY HOT. He yelled, “NOOOOOOO!!!!!!” Just as I deposited a big forkful into my mouth. I should have spit it out, but I was being proper. He handed me a cloth to encourage spitting, but you must know, I gag when I spit as I brush my teeth. Spitting is so... not me. 

Later when life took us in different directions, he and his family traveled to see me several times.  He always brings roses. He always cooked for me, even if he had to smash bread at a campfire and call in Naan. *Laughs*. Don’t tell him, but now I can cook better than he can.  Shhhhhhhhhhhh. We don’t want him to stop cooking when he visits us. 

Best part I remember was how he never acted in appropriately when he was assigned to assist me during my time as Mayor. So many of them did, and he spent much time alone, only respected me.  Also recall how he was abused so badly following 9-11.  He left the military, literally hid his family in a rustic cabin he bought in the Alaskan town a good deal out of town. He had been a hero to the army and Air Force. He was literally the only one trained in the army for a particular specialty and the Air Force needed it so he worked for the Air Force and was in the army... a very rare situation.  I still cry when I remember catching him securing groceries at Sams Club. In the ten minutes he was there, he was yelled at 7 times... more than that but from 7 different people who screamed abusive remarks about him and his family. It was the only time he didn’t want to be around me. Later he told me, he was afraid for his life, but that had become second nature. It was him being afraid for mine just for talking to him that has stayed with me all this time. He said, “I can’t sleep wondering if my friend will be attacked for being my friend. It’s best if we stay hidden from each other until America’s wounds heal some. I’m angry too, but I am grieving so many different things, not just my bothers and sisters lost just going to work on 911, our firemen and... he cried. He spoke no other word.  Just smiled and said, “be careful. I am sure you are safe, but please keep your eyes open until you KNOW you are. Some people are so hurt by this that they can’t act rationally. Don’t be angry at them. Just be patient.” 

He changed though. The next time I saw him was a couple years later. He was different. He cooked for me.  He explained his religion. He cried. He wasn’t the beacon of strength he had been. He was a broken man.  911 and radical religious assholes broke that man’s spirit.  Most of us moved on, even those of us who lost someone very dear as I did, but he... he still has not.  He’s still living a nightmare because he lost everything when he had to hide, most of all his pride and his faith in Americans to love and cherish their own, no matter the color or skin, religious beliefs, and not even if they served many tours in war torn places.  Not even if that soldier was a decorated uniformed hero. And that... well that broke my heart. 

Somehow I see anything India lately and I miss him and his wife. I only ever saw their two children once.   I always thought our kids would grow up as friends. 911 took a woman I as falling in love with. And it took Mr Khan, at least him as he was. I suspect it destroyed his family, too based on a rumor I heard. I guess I lost nothing but tears and sleep compared to him. I feel so grateful. I think I could play this game and any other Indian themed one, but I cant do it without sharing the beautiful memories of a beautiful man... a beautiful member of my chosen heart family.

RATING: 7
7 for now. The pace of the game was mystifying to us in our 3p first play, we blew through the first 2 sets of cards, then slowed down and realized we needed to score points on the god track thing to actually get some VP. The production of goods is complicated and requires multiple turns of planning, and you need to watch what everyone else has available to make sure you dont lose all that planning to someone who beats you to a contract or whatever you call it. I like the sun mechanic too though it ultimately feels a bit fiddly for not much payoff. Interesting, gorgeous, maybe a bit overwrought but we'll see on subsequent plays.

FWIW: we literally banged on the table to test the slanted board and nothing even slightly budged. I have to think that anyone who is complaining about this either built it wrong or has no manual dexterity? Also, complaints about the board being confusing are also overboard imo, the goods upgrade in straight horizontal lines with one dead end good in the middle of each row in the same spot always. once you know this, there isn't much to really be confused about?

First play: Whilst 7 as a rating isn't a bad score per se, I must confess to being rather disappointed after play #1. I expected more from this.
The Cons:
The rules are fiddly. The 28 page rule book wouldn't be as long if they weren't. We struggled to get clarification on whether a favour could process to an unbuilt building. This is a game where the first game will be slow.
Foggy iconography. You look at the main characters and the icons just don't help you out unless you are familiar with what they do.
The artwork really confuses where the buildings are and the flow from one to the other. The graphics are lovely but obscure the town and buildings terribly.
More down time than I like. Previous player actions can trash your plans. You really have to wait to see what is available on your turn.

Massive issue was the imperial board. I accidentally nudged the back screen and every marker went flying so we had to best guess where everything went. A peg board might not look as nice but would be 1000% more practical because the nudge nearly ended the game and hour early.

The Pro's. It looks like there might be a clever game in there, my group said they would want to play again but I'm not sure that I really want to.

heavy stuff, need more plays to see the full picture. Maybe nothing really new here ,but a very clever game in its genre.

second game : actions much more clear, faster play, better engine, less downtime, no more need for arrows, symbols are known, rulebook stayed in the box.
so if you are willing to put some effort in the learning curve this game turns out to be amazing.
for me together with Lisboa the best brainburners of 2017
rating going up

after 4 games : keeps getting better and better, on the board and in the mind.

looks like most of the ratings that are low ,are from people who played only once.

Boy, do I hate games like this.  Okay, the board is gorgeous, but it took my gaming group probably ten minutes to understand it.  Ten minutes!!  That is time that I will never get back.  Unforgivable!!

And the gameplay is worse.  It took us the better part of an hour to grok the interplay of 16 resources.  I want a game that I can learn in 20 minutes and master in an hour, to make me feel my brilliance and take some of the sting out of the fact that I’v never really done much with my life.

As someone else described it on BGG: a "very Euroey Euro." Lots of moving parts and convoluted, unintuitive rules. The poorly-organized rulebook and impossible-to-read board do not help the game's accessibility. But once you get it to the table, it's fine. 

I like the "meditation" and "fortune" bonus actions, and think the bumping system makes for some interesting decisions (you want someone to bump you while standing). I wish the board scaled for two players, because you don't get bumped as often, and it's very easy for both players to get "stuck" out on the board. The game is also a little too long for what it is. I can only see my rating fall with future plays, but for now, it's good enough to keep.

Absolutely stunning game with the beautiful art and great custom wooden pieces. Very solid worker placement gameplay and resource conversion to fill contracts. Agra also has a couple of really neat mechanisms on your personal boards with farmer positions determining how many of each basic resource you can produce and the meditation tracks that lets you do additional actions at the beginning of your turn. You can also spend favor tokens to get additional actions that can result in the occasional big, satisfying, combo on your turn. I also really liked the fact that money is hidden so there is no way for players to know exactly how everyone is doing. My main complaint is that the board could have made the resource conversion paths a little clearer on the board. Also, there is a lot of choices available each turn so AP-prone players could make the game run long. Despite that, Agra is a wonderful-looking, medium-heavy Euro for fans of worker placement.

Heavy euro that will take up the entire table.There are 12 types of goods in this game and multiple things players can do with those goods leaving many agonizing decisions. This game is not for the light gamer. With all the actions and sub-actions players need to be somewhat experienced going into this, otherwise, expect a good hour or so of rules explanation. 

I really liked this game. Even with all that is going on in this it all makes sense and blends together nicely.  It also played in good time for a game of this weight. I felt engaged the entire time. Yes, the iconography could be better, but with experience and familiarity it won't matter as much. I am really excited to try out the many strategy paths this game has to offer. It is a deep, heavy game that warrants it's 2 hour game time.

:star::star::star::star::star::star:
If chess were to be reincarnated as a euro game, it would be called Agra. The opening moves and how your opponent responds sets the stage for nearly limitless strategic possibilities and decisions that will handsomely reward the player who takes the time to properly invest in the learning and discovery of the game. Although Agra is not a perfect information game like Chess, the one hidden component - money - adds an exhilarating endgame acceleration and provides tension to the very end.

The multiple currencies, or gears, of the game will, at first, appear arbitrary and burdensome when trying to make decisions and may even deter many a gamer from diving deeper into the game. For those who chose to make the time investment to learn and discover how these gears mesh together will find themselves lost in a world of wonderful strategic choices instead of the world of some thinly veiled theme that is soon forgotten. 

To me this is the perfect euro, and for that I give it a 6/6. I hesitated at first giving it a full 6 because the difference between a 5 and a 6 for me has to do with future gaming experiences I anticipate having with this game. Frankly speaking, outside of playing with Jeffrey I am not sure when this game will hit the table in the future. My primary gaming partner is my wife and as it stands today the investment required to start feeling rewarded for your strategic decisions  is an insurmountable hurdle for her to want to jump into this game. Although this game may not get as many future plays as I desire, the gaming experience that it has already provided me with my 6 plays, are memorable and have set the bar to a new standard that I will expect from heavy euros in the future.

I do recommend this game as a “buy before you try” - yes, you heard that right - “buy before you try”. To  truly appreciate the game one has to allow themselves the time and commitment to get lost in it to recognize its full potential. If this  is not the type of commitment you want to give a game, then move along, this may not be the game for you.

RATING: 5
Update: Rating going down. Just too many resources, and too many categories of actions (not actions). Unlike something like Le Havre which also has many resource types, the resources here don't feel like anything in particular, and for the most part don't feel different from each other at all. They could just be numbered Resource 1 through Resource 12. And the game is just too long for what it offers, which is pretty standard resource conversion fare. AP is a real thing here, and it does pay off, so it's hard to prod people along. Including myself.

Hard to rate after the first game. Seems pretty good, but there's a lot of stuff on. In addition to main actions, there is a menu of secondary actions, including a sub-menu of actions you use via favor, which separate from influence. There are orders to fill for guilds, as well as to specific nobles within the guilds. There are [b]12[/b] different resources. But despite all that, the only major gripe is the production choices. The board looks like it was designed to be hung on a wall, not play a game on. It's really not that complicated, but it looks like a mess. It really is bad enough that people can get confused on what it's actually saying. And it's enormous. But really, the cherry on top is the guild board, which for some unknowable reason they decided to make a slanted board to place tall/skinny pieces, just to make sure that if any piece falls over (which is easy to do, since it's slanted), it knocks over all the other pieces below/around it. Those with large or unsteady hands [i]will not[/i] be able to use it all. I felt like I was playing the old kids dexterity game Operation.

Agra is a massive and extremely overproduced resource conversion game, in which it all comes down to producing, processing and exchanging up to 16 (mostly useless) different goods and being the first to fulfill a plethora of assignments. With all players competing for the same deliveries and goods becoming more or less valuable from turn to turn, you feel like a cunning merchant, always looking for the best opportunities. The lack of long-term goals and planning, though, also makes the game seem quite too long and convoluted for what it is. That said, the ability to lay down your used workers or keep them blocking their spots in order to have access to diferent kinds of additional actions is an interesting twist to the genre, so I'd be glad to explore it a few more times.

Demo'ed at Gencon.  Core of the game is worker placement to generate/upgrade resources for fulfillment of various interwoven point-salad-like purposes.  There's a bit of engine building as additional actions are unlocked through various means.

Planning errors are somewhat mitigated by the meditation and favor mechanics, which allow players to build up a significant amount of resource flexibility.  This makes for very smooth game-play.  Despite this mitigation, careful resource planning still pays off through more efficient utilization of these two mechanics.

The artwork is beautiful, and the components are all high quality.  My only complaint functionality-wise is that some of the supply-chain lines between the buildings are a little difficult to see/follow.

Initial thoughts are highly positive, and plan to purchase when released.

Lovely rendition of La Granja, excluding the multi purpose cards, and relying heavily on the raw resource refinement. 

Basically an aggressive contract fulfillment game with loads of choices of passive/free actions to take,multiple victory paths, variable game end, not as complex or heavy as it looks, overproduced a bit but it works like a charm (most of the time) theme wise , really good player scaling, plays usually under 2 hours,lovely LOVELY art!

My only complain is that the main board doesn't clearly distinguish where each production building start/ends for either worker placement or resource storing.Especially the latter is an issue, since every resource is stored in the main board for every player and mistakes are bound to happen and interfere with your planning.

Overall an enjoyable experience with loads of eye candy and a more aggressive gameplay than your average Euro.

The game is nice, but because of its several moving parts requires a learning game before you really can start to properly plan your strategy from the beginning. The basic idea is simple, produce and process goods and deliver those to different places. The trick is how to do this in the most efficient way possible using your actions, meditation and favors. I really like the artwork and quality of the components, but some symbols in the game could look a bit more distinct in order to avoid confusions and the processing buildings on the map could be better distinguishable from the other buildings in the city.

I am a great admirer of Michael Menzel's artwork & when I saw this game immediately wanted to buy & play.  However, much to my surprise the thing I like least about this game is the confusion on the board--it is very difficult to follow the very thin lines to their true building destinations and sometimes had difficulty deciding where a building ended & another began.  It slowed the game down.  
  As far as play goes, I had pre-read the rules & thought I had a good understanding of the game.  In truth, all actions are pretty basic or simple, but there are so many options, so many things to keep track of, I found myself floundering, much to my astonishment.
  A beautiful looking game with great components, but I took it off my buy list, mainly due to the board being so difficult to decipher.

AGRA ist nach LA GRANJA und SOLARIUS MISSION das dritte Spiel des Hopp Schwyzers Mike Keller und sein erstes als Soloautor. Und es ist ein physischer Monumentalbau: Das Spielbrett hat die Größe eines Tisches. Der kaiserliche Hof ist ein phantasmagorischer Tempel. Selbst die Worker aus Chinaholz verlieren sich trotz ihrer Übergröße in der ockerfarbenen Weite von Michael Menzels Indien des 13. Jahrhunderts. Und auch die Mechanismen flirren durch das Spiel wie die Fliegen am Ganges als wäre es das letzte Eurogame vor dem Weltuntergang des Brettspiels, in das noch alle schönen Ideen hineingepackt werden mussten: hier noch ein guter Kniff, da noch ein kreativer Dreh, hier noch eine nette Zusatzaktion, hier noch ein hübscher Extrazug, da noch eine der vielen Optionen, Optionen, Optionen. AGRA ist 3in1, drei Eurogames in einem, ein Spiel gewordenes Überangebot, vollgepackt mit allen Tricks, um ein freies Spiel noch beweglicher zu machen. Regel in der Regel in der Regel. Entschlackung war den Leuten von Quined Games um Arno Quispel hier ein Fremdwort. Dies wiederum spiegelt sich positiv im üppigem Material und der indischen Farbpracht wider. AGRA ist faszinierend und abschreckend overengineed zugleich. Man muss schon mit AGRA aufgewachsen sein oder Mike Keller heissen, um alle Möglichkeiten in einem Zug erfassen, lesen und daraus auch noch die beste auswählen zu können. Aber dies alles muss kein Problem sein: lässt man den Bewältigungsversuch nämlich los und behandelt AGRA als Entdeckungsreise, dann öffnet sich das Spiel. Wir schweben plötzlich durch das Chaos und merken: ist alles gar nicht so schlimm. Alles halb so wild. Zumindest nicht so, wie es der verwirrend aufgebaute Regel-Demogorgon suggeriert. Im Ausprobieren und Entdecken des Spiels löst sich das wirre Flechtengebilde des 28seitigen verkomplizierenden Regelhefts auf. Zudem lässt sich AGRA auch ganz taktisch spielen von Moment zu Moment. Nein, man muss AGRA nicht "können". Man muss es einfach bereisen. Und es gibt immer etwas Gutes, das man machen kann. Irgendwas geht immer. Und man profitiert, wenn der eigene Arbeiter von einem Aktionsfeld verdrängt wird. Das nennt Mike Keller "Gunst" (Zusatzaktion). Meditieren kann man auch (Zusatzaktion). Und im Zimmer brennt ein Räucherstäbchen, es duftet wohlig nach Patchouli (Zusatzaktion des Gastgebers). AGRA ist Quantität, viel Regel in der Breite. Ein guter Erklärbar ist die halbe Miete. Ein guter Erklärbar kompensiert das Regelumständliche. Mit einem schlechten Erklärbaren ist die Gefahr groß, dass das Spiel schon in der Erstpartie in der Frustabteilung landet. AGRA ist viel in der Summe, aber letztendlich weniger Spiel als seine Regel. Das könnte für manchen die eigentliche Enttäuschung sein.

In my opinion, Agra is a very good game, not as complex as people say. It has been criticized for being artificially complex, bad rules, repetitive, boring, over-produced, and so on. 
I agree that the board could be a bit clearer, but I don't think such is a big problem. 
I like over-produced games if price is fair. Much nicer to play with top quality components than poorly produced games.
I think rules are specifically well written, very clear, and not open to mistakes.
In Agra you need to plan several turns ahead in advance in order to be succesful, and here is where you find the complexity, but not in the mechanics which are pretty straight forward. Such "thinking ahead" can create some AP, but nothing terrible as you can be thinking on your next turns while others are playing.
Final score is tight, which is always good.
You feel constantly the urge to deliver goods before the others in the race to fulfill orders.
The 2 rupiah cost to repeat actions is a great way to avoid players keep doing same strategy process over and over again as part of the engine building.
Perhaps there can be some replayability concerns, as someone can play always following a similar strategy, but the number of several different ways to get rupiah/points both during the game and in the final score is wide enough to offer variaty and so, replayability. And the "always-follow-same-strategy" which can also happens in games like Tzolkin, can easily be broken by the fellow players, or at least make it harder to maintain.
In summary, a beautiful and deep strategy game which I want to play more.

[b]Reasons I own it:[/b]

Was initially drawn to Agra for it's artwork and presentation, knew nothing about the gameplay. I was also in a transition period where I realised I simply enjoy euro games with trading in the Mediterranean and building aspects more than player-conflicts. Hence, Agra arrived at the right time for me. Read the rules way before the game was released and really liked it.

- A no-conflict euro game
- The gameplay really appeals to me, looks complicated but the mechanics are simple when you play
- The period of history I really like, which is set in India
- Micheal Menzel's artwork & Mike Keller's design
- Love the game's intimidating yet charming & vibrant presentation

[b]Components and presentation[/b]

Quined games has really produced another quality product product. 
- Everything from the wooden meeple (love the vibrant colours of the meeple) to the tokens are all well produced.
- Agra once setup on the table really piques people's interest. What really pulled me into Agra was the cover art and when the Imperial Board's image went up on BGG, a bold design decision looks really attractive once it is setup and as it starts filling up the vibrant colours of the tokens really makes it pop (sometimes it's a tad bit fiddly and tokens do fall off but I cannot imagine the game without it).
- Micheal Menzel's art doesn't need an introduction, it's just beautiful. The only minor gripe I had about the board's graphic design was the border on the buildings, they are really hard to read, especially if you are new to the game. But after few turns, it stops becoming an issue.

[b]Reasons I like playing it:[/b]

- I enjoy puzzle, and Agra is beast of a puzzle
- Heavy, brain-melting planning you need to do, just to deliver a goddamn plank or oil and the satisfaction of making a sweet long delivery and chaining your actions
- Interesting multiple action phases that will make you plan ahead considerably
- Many ways to get VPs, yet not a point salad
- Surprisingly player-interactive
- No major bad events occur in the game, yet it has a really nice tension to it when the Notables starts getting filled up
- Leaves a satisfactory feeling of having played a well-designed game.


[b]Favourite game mechanism & gameplay:[/b]

Apart from the generic worker placement & resource management of a euro-game what I really like about Agra are:

- The player-board and how you choose to move your farmers, increasing one resource and decreasing another.
- Both the Merchant & Builder is really cool and I really like how they interact with the board and give benefits when you use their space.
- The bumping workers and favour option is great (in a 2 player, it does occur but not as often as I would've liked, however, a 3 or 4 player game will be really different with a lot of favour actions)
- - The meditation phase and how you spend your meditation points on the Meditation Action rondel are awesome, they help your main action phase which follows right after.
- The double delivery to Notables is a really awesome mechanism to ramp up competition for a powerful Notable card
- The piggybacking when processing goods are really nice, almost like a win-win turn for players.
- The one-time secondary actions are great and can help you sometimes to push for a big turn, and they can be used anytime (once per turn!).
- The way you earn coins (VP) from the Notables is really nice (it was a bit confusing in the beginning when I was learning the game). The addition of coins based on tokens (goods) already present on the Notable feels rewarding & satisfying.
- Getting to take favour action in between your actions and also using the Notable's abilities are awesome.
- The order-phase is a neat, helping players to catch up.
- The small race element added to imperial delivery adds a bit of tension 
- The player token management, especially when running short, in case you have many imperial & guild deliveries made and there are few incomplete Notable with your token on them.

[b]Things I am not very fond of in the game[/b]

There are not many things I dislike in Agra, but few that do pop up in my head and they are:


- Ambiguity in certain rules (the forum has already addressed many issues, but a new Agra player would find it a bit tough initially). Quined might release a V2 for rules or an errata.
- 2 player version of Agra will feel slightly different from more player count as you will not experience the same level of player interaction. (Now I have played a variant Mike send me, called The Guard who remedies this, but it's not official at the time of me writing this)
- Not so much of a negative, but from what I notice, everyone almost takes similar paths and I wish there was slight variation from of turns for players. However, this is interesting because while I wish it had a bit of variation from players, you also get to see some amazing moves being pulled off by your opponent who is probably trying to do the same thing you were planning.
- Sometimes the book-keeping gets in the way, a minor complaint
- Wish there was a way to track the meditation points we have earned rather than keeping it in our head and spending it - its a bit too much when you have to plan for your action and keep all this in our head.
- Teaching the game takes a long time, this makes me sceptical to take it to people who haven't played Agra

Agra was one of my anticipated games of 2017, and it was worth the wait, meaty heavy euro with no luck and a game that leaves a satisfaction of play (whether I win or lose) after a session is over we talk about how we could have done something differently and how the race for imperial delivery changed certain plans or how people horde stuff for making an epic delivery when using the Sailor. 

Agra is certainly not a game for everyone and many might dismiss it after 1st play, I think it requires a learning play to understand the game and then another play where you will actually enjoy this deep, rich sandboxy puzzle Mike and Quined has put out, especially if you like euro games.

Note** Many of my plays are solo

Aggro the monster, kept inside of a beautiful game box called Agra...

There are plenty of rules for known stuff that shouldn't need that many rules. While I understood every rule from the start, it was pretty hard to sort them and not to forget one or another small rule, which may be very important in the game.

It's still a good game, even though I really dislike "converting games". I will probably play it again, but I wouldn't buy it for the sole reason, that there are tons of similar games out there already (mostly with less rules).

While the production is top notch, the useability suffers from it. The different locations and their products aren't connected well, so that you need to take a closer look. All those wood pieces like to fall off, especially from the "stairwell" (Palace), which can make people go aggro instead of Agra.

I love heavier games and this certainly fits the bill. A few actions to choose from but a wide variety of goals one can work too makes this very interesting. Yet it didn't click for me. The board is gorgeous sure, the iconography not so much. What's with all the arrows that blend with the background picture making it hard to see where they go. Also why not get the same 'sort' of goods on the same row, very confusing when you're planning to upgrade a good. The race aspect to go for certain cards / offerings makes it somewhat less interesting for me too, I get that timing is key here and I love that but not when you're left with useless stuff once you're too late. That sets you back.

All in all this is a good game and I see why many people like it. I just don't. The learning curve is a little steep and I'd choose many heavy games over this one because of that.

A good game with excellent eye candy but it just doesn't work well physically. While it's tough to teach and has a lot going on, I didn't find it overly hard to understand once you get over the initial learning curve. At that point though, after three plays, I didn't find the game deep enough to purchase. While I'd play it again, I won't be seeking it out.

RATING: 6
Agra is a beautiful-looking game with some new ideas that work well, but it's not a game for gamers who enjoy constructing a plan and executing it. The game's state is somewhat chaotic as many turns begin with reassessing whether one's original plan is still valid given what others players have done. As the game approaches (and usually exceeds) 120 minutes, this lack of long-term planning makes the game feel repetitive and uninteresting. Games of this weight and length should create a feeling of building toward something - a feeling Agra does not provide.

RATING: 3
The mechanics of this game is not vary complexed, the problem is to remember them all and there is alot of them! The main problem is that the symbols that represents all the mechnics is really bad especially the cards! The rulebook have to be consulted all the time.

Yes the game offers many possible moves but because of the bad symbols and layout its really hard to clearly see what options you really have.

If you invest a lot of time in to the game you will probably learn its cryptic language but for me its not worth it.

The Imperial baord might look cool but its not vary good. it is suppose to hold alot of components but if even one of the resources for example the fest falls over it could roll down the entire borad and create chaos.

Very strategic with room for tactical play. Quite interactive thanks to teh favor mechanic.

I do believe it best at the full four player count=;
And it's a bit fiddly at times with the palace board being on a slope, thus requiring your most commonly used component to similarly have one non-striaght edge.

Played this 4 player last night and it was pretty good. In short it is a worker placement game with lots of ways to get bonus actions. On the upside it had lots of different mechanisms and pathways to play out giving loads of variety, in addition the mechanisms intertwine and mesh together well which was great. On the downside as the game went on planning on another players turn was a waste of time, the build up of extra actions through meditation and favours meant that whatever you plan the player before you can do it first, this leads to each player waiting for their turn to plan as well as execute which leads to a lot of downtime, I was fortunate that everyone on our table was fairly quick with the planning but a player with AP will kill the game dead. On the whole I want the game for its miriad of mechanisms however I fear that like several other games (The Gallerist, Kanban, Seasons, Through the Ages and a few others) because of player numbers, downtime  and complexity it would never get played and I have enough enjoyable mid-heavy games that never get played anyway. I have rated it 7.5 as I would love to play it again - but I cannot ever see me suggesting it because of the envisaged downtime factor.

Beautiful game, the board is a piece of art.
The game is meaty and interesting, the weight comes from the multiple options you have to do everything. you can always decide to do one step per turn, but if you want to be efficient you need to be creative and analyze the multiple options you have to reach your goal.

Agra is the most beautiful game I know (even more than Archipelago). 
Demoplay at Essen: Explanation did only take 15 minutes (to my surprise), but only covered the basics ofc. You are a trader in India trying to get commodities to trade with the Sultan, the guilds or the Notables. Gameplay felt intense and very deep, but the downtime was surprisingly short (due to favor and participate decisions). We mostly produced goods, tried the gardener actions and built some buildings. We did only deliver 3 goods and fulfilled one contract and decided to cancel the game after 30-45 Min, because we all had more stuff to do.

I liked the game so much that I thought about it for the rest of the day, even during 2 other games. I decided to buy it at the end of the day, to reward Quined Games for the stunning production quality and because it really thrilled me. Spent half my night with reading the rules surprise. Early rating 7.5 to 9.0 (as I have not played the full game yet) probably 8.5 or more. This will probably not get played so often, as the two games in my collection with comparable complexity (Brass and Mombasa) only get played 1 or 2 times a year. I prefer this to Gaia project or Keyper, and find it as interesting as Lisboa (which I did not buy because it’s too expensive). I recommend it to anyone looking for a (really) heavy euro game.

Wirklich ein Klasse Spiel!!! Ich kann nicht verstehen das dieses Spiel so verrissen wird. Wer es hat und mit dem Gedanken spielt es verkaufen zu wollen, weil alle Welt das Spiel nur "mittelmäßig oder Regellastig findet", dem empfehle ich das Spiel 2 oder 3 mal zu spielen, denn erst dann entdeckt  man die vielen Möglichkeiten die das Spiel bietet. Die erste Partie ist auf jeden Fall ein Einführungs oder Lern- bzw. Probespiel aber spätestens beim zweiten oder dritten mal spielen entdeckt man immer mehr Möglichkeiten. Also lasst euch von den einschlägigen Videoportalen nicht das Spiel schlecht reden, sondern spielt es einfach selber und bildet euch dann ein eigenes Urteil.
Für Spieler die hauptsächlich "Mensch ärgere dich nicht!" oder "Monopoly" spielen ist diese Spiel natürlich keine Empfehlung aber für Spieler die sich Vielspieler nennen sollte dieses Spiel etwas sein. Natürlich Vorausgesetzt man mag Workerplacement Spiele, Resourcenmanagement und auch eine etwas längere Spielzeit.
Allerdings vergeht diese etwas längere Spielzeit ohne das es langweilig wird.

A very beautiful and very confusing game. graphics are confusing, strategies are confusing, moves are confusing... 
you need to produce goods and sell them. The thing is there are four basic goods and each one can be upgraded several times. However there are no intersecting paths, no way to exchange goods. So you need to have a very clear idea as to what you will produce. Then you sell them. Well the thing is It is not an open market. You can sell only very specific items to very specific places. Only the fastest can sell his item. Once the item has been bought, you most likely cannot sell this item for a while... or ever. It is also very unclear to guess what other players will do as nothing is made in a very straightforward way. Even turns can become simgle , double or triple turns... so you end up having to deal when your turn comes with the goods you have and find the best way to place them, and a big interrogation point as to what you really want to produce. This makes for a very long game with a lot of downplay. Still it is not unpleasant to play it, so I'd join a game if my buddies wish to play it, but I would never open the box myself.

Agra is a resource conversion and contract fulfillment game set in medieval India. Like in Keller's previous designs, resources are denoted by player tokens, and their position on the board indicates what type of resource it is. Players use their pawns to activate action spaces, which let them produce or upgrade resources, build new resource spots, to deliver to notables. If another player's pawn occupies that spot, you kick him out and he gains a bonus. There is also a "meditation" mechanic that allows a player to get extra actions, but negates the kicked-out bonuses. Delivering to notables can be done in full or part, and the player with the most deliveries to a given notable will get his special ability when his delivery is complete (other players will get a bonus). At the end of each turn, players can deliver to Akbar or guilds for end-game points. While the meditation mechanic in the game was kind of neat, I found the game to be somewhat convoluted for what amounted to a fairly bland resource conversion game. I also have some graphic design complaints--the Michael Menzel art was sure pretty, but it obscured rather than accentuated the board's function. Additionally, the sloped Akbar/guild board was a fantastically poor idea, as it is incredibly easy to knock the long, skinny markers over, which then knocked a bunch of other pieces over bowling-pin style.

First impression from Spellenspektakel. The game looks very complex, but the rules are quite intuitive (apart from some details) and it plays quicker than you would expect. Components and art are great. What stood out most gameplay-wise, is the huge amount of options. Not just different options, but also multiple options to get the same resources for example. This promotes creative thinking a lot, which is good in my opinion. On the other hand, this causes a very high learning curve. I can imagine you need to play this game like five times to get a grip on different strategies. I will have to see if this great first impression holds up after (hopefully) more games; looking forward to playing it again!

This game has to potential to get a better rating, but the first game you will have a lot of stalling as you have to understand the iconography and look things up a lot. But I have the impression that there are quite a few strategies you can pursue. in this game.

One thing is for sure:  the structure of the rulebook is just horrible. I hate when they explain only half of an action and say they will explain the rest further on, which is only confusing as suddenly they are more restrictions or more things to keep in mind.

One of the great worker placement games I learned this year. There is a lot going on and a lot to consider. You have to find the best path and try to go down it. Beautiful game and quality. I simply can not wait until this game is released. Seems to be very polished and solid design from Michael Keller. I think will be a big hit with several people I know.

Agra is a worker placement game where you place your workers on the central board's spaces to produce resources, or on the figures at the top to resolve their special actions. The resources can be sent by various methods to fill orders, which gets you some combination of money and reputation. Reputation then in turn increases the amount you get on future deliveries. I know this sounds like every euro game, but there are a number of things that make this game remarkable.

First, the game is nearly devoid of luck. Every feature of the game is laid out at the very start, so the only thing in the way of you and your path is your own mistakes and the actions of other players. The second is that the game uses a really interesting take on worker placement. Unlike most games where you have to earn new workers, this game gives you a huge pile of workers right at the start. The trick of it is that they don't come back to you until someone else uses that action. If you never used that meeple for the prayer action which I'm not even going to get into, you also get a kicked-out marker that can be spent to preform bonus actions printed on your player board.

The cards when fully fulfilled check to see who delivered the most goods to them, and then they go to that player and provide them with a special ability. The goods have an interesting mechanism where the production buildings have arrows leading to refinement buildings. Once you have the basic goods, and the refinement buildings are constructed, you can resolve an action to move those goods along the arrow making them more valuable in their refined form. Refining these goods also allows for other players to follow you which generated more bonus action markers for the active player.

So ultimately we have a low luck game with a lot of player interaction, that handles worker placement and resource management in a unique way. That enough gets it my recommendation, not even accounting for all the cute ways the game gives you opportunities for clever moves and the way player choices really drive the path of what's available session to session. So then, let me mention the negatives we ran into.

The AP can be high in this game. The graphic design is also not the best. The game comes with this odd angled platform that tracks who delivered what to where, and it's pointless and easily jostled. On the main board, the arrows that track the resource upgrade path are interrupted by the art so that the arrows can be shown going through an underpass or some such, which makes it slightly annoying to track what's connected to where when the board gets busy. There's also a boatman piece that tracks when new cards become available to send goods to, and along the river there are printed indicators as to when he moves. There's a spot where it shows two completed icons which indicates 2 completed cards in total instead of what we thought it meant, which was 2 more completed cards. All this being said, I am actively excited for more plays of this now that I have a sense of the what and the why. 

:star: Art, Iconography and components functional
:star: Clever or interesting mechanisms
:nostar: Reasonably low downtime between turns with mildly AP players

I have been lucky to playtest this game a few times, and it's a very deep, yet really fun to play games. it' s very generous game: there is always something interesting to do, somewhere fun to go, and player turns are quite quick. I love the mechanism to earn resources, the way the Notables change every game, and it's fun to see that the game never ends the same way: it's really cool to see how the focus can shift at the table from game to game. With the incredible illustrations now of Michael Menzel ? I can't wait to see the final product in Essen.

Beautiful and heavy. I love the individual mechanics like the resource trees, bumping workers, karma, delivering goods, etc. Together, however, they feel a bit chaotic. A lot of players stepping on eachothers toes and messing up plans without really trying. Might be better with fewer players, but your mileage may vary.

[u]The Positive:[/u]
:) What a stunningly gorgeous big board. It looks like a colorful painting: art on your gaming table! The characters on cards are beautifully drawn, the components all have a top notch look and feel to them (original shade of colors, original big shapes, a small magnifying glass, the staircase to the palace, ...). This game sure looks amazing!

:) Mechanically, the game is based on known mechanics, but it definately has its own character. The core of the game revolves around producing resources (a mind-blowing 16 different resources available of which 4 are basic resources!), refining them and trading them away in order to score points or gain (minor) special abilities. Been there done that, right? However: there are some engines running in the background: you can significantly optimize your production engine to produce certain basic resources, you can greatly optimize your point scoring engine for fullfilling contracts at the palace and you can invest in getting more powerful options for doing some bonus moves at the start of your turn by improving your meditation skills. There is an interesting mechanic in which your workers remain on the board: when an opponent kicks you out, your worker returns home but you can gain a favor pawn which can grant you some sort of bonus for when the time comes that you need flexibility. When you want to use an action with one of your workers on it, you lose 2 points. Next to this basic concept there is more going on with players getting (minor) special abilities by obtaining noble cards, players building factories opening up new available action spots (which incurs a one time bonus for the builder, but no permanent abilities or bonusses), a moving mechant pawn creating tactical opportunities on different spots on the board, ... Mechanically, this is a solid design and the sheer amount of resources coupled with the fact that the game offers multiple possibilities of getting things done (through meditation, producing, refining, trading, spending favor, ...) gives this game its own character.

:) Player interaction is just the way I like it: well thought out and interesting. You want others to kick your workers out of action spots in order to gain favor. However, if you have invested heavily into mediation, you might prefer to keep enough workers on the board in order to use them to access powerful meditation moves. There is somewhat of a race going on in climbing 3 different stairs on the palace and fullfilling the corresponding contracts. Different players can invest in the same noble card, but one one player will be awarded the card with its special ability. Due to a wealth of such mechanics, the game keeps every player involved also when an opponent is making his moves. More often than not, player interaction in Agra is positive: while playing your turn you are giving opportunities to your opponents: make sure you don't start doing their work and be on the lookout when an opponent opens up a golden opportunity for you.

:) More often than not, game turns move quickly and downtime is limited. Usually, an action is not very spectacular (the game is based on many 'small' actions and it takes a while to build up to something significant), but when you piece it togheter correctly, every now and then, you unfold a big plan and unleash your engine and shake the entire game up scoring massive points. The look on your opponents faces when you do so is pretty priceless.

:) It takes some investment learning and teaching this game, but the manual is well structured and should you require a certain rule or an explanation of a card, there is a clear content table and you can find everything in a logical spot. A big asset for a complex game!

:) This is not a short game, but for the depth it offers, play time is reasonable to me. With a play time of about 30/40 min per player it is well possible to play this adventure on a boardgame evening with friends.

:) The game remains fairly balanced. Points are hidden, so it's not easy to spot the leader and as the game doesn't offer many meaningful permanent advantages to players, you should expect most (equally skilled and experienced) players to remain 'in the running' until the very end.

[u]The negative:[/u]
:soblue: While the art is beautiful and most of the iconography is really functional, there are some minor annoyances in the graphical design. 3 out of 16 resources (turmeric powder, curry and cement) look a little similar (an orange pile in a bowl) when viewed from afar. The factories are connected with arrows depicting refinement processes (you can turn paper into books for example) but while playing they can get a little lost in the board art. Those are small annoyances, and obviously a trade off was made to find a sweet spot between creating a beautiful board with stunning art and a functional game with more obvious icons and board layout.

:soblue: My biggest concern with Agra is the number of resources (16 different types) coupled with the fact that the game requires you to have a huge variety of resources to get anything done. There is little opportunity to specialize in something meaningful. Yes, probably you should specialize in producing at least 2 different basic resources real effectively, but only to have enough resource pawns on the board to trade them for something else. That way, Agra doesn't give me the feeling of building an empire, getting stronger and more effective along the way, but rather of being a merchant who trades away 3 limestone for one or more of 15 other resources. I prefer building an ever stronger and more efficient production chain and dominating the market, rather than building up a shop in which eventually cloths, cloth and cotton are available next to bricks, books, figurines, planks, paper, curry, wood, paintings, ... In that way, the game is not very generous: from start to finish, you are basically searching which totally unrelated resources could be beneficial and you try to produce or trade them in order to make the most effective conversions. After that, you look for new unrelated resources to combine. The game offers little permanent advantages (the noble cards offer minor abilities, some personal favor tiles give a personal touch, but it is all very minor and doesn't really affect the game significantly). In that sense, there is little growth and only by occasion the game gives you the feeling of accomplishment for all your hard thinking and careful combining of resources. Players will basically be doing the same: they try to get many resources out effectively and trade them away for all different sort of things in order to score their most valuable contract or increase point scoring potential by trading with nobles. Their business will most likely develop similarly (but there will obviously be differences as certain players will focus on different basic resources, invest in meditation or will have small advantages over others with certain actions due to noble cards).

[u]Conclusion:[/u]
Agra is a beautifully produced game which offers players a serious challenge in obtaining and converting 16 different resources in the most effective way. The mechanics are not especially innovative by themselves, but they are cleverly integrated in a very interesting way to create a solid game engine with a unique flavor. The game offers many different ways to obtain the goods you require and continuously generates opportunities for players, however, getting some serious stuff done usually requires many actions and long term plans. This is a game of baby steps in which every now and then they lead to a sudden significant cascade of events. Agra must derive its appeal from those occasional turns, because overall the game doesn't offer many meaningful ways to differentiate between players or to create your own paths, which might be an issue to players who require this to enjoy their game. The upside to this is that Agra remains balanced throughout: players keep playing the same game fighting with more or less equally strong weapons.

Agra seems to be a polarizing game. Is there a high rules overhead? Absolutely. This is primarily what has turned its following asunder. However, I believe that this extensive ruleset conceals an astounding strategic game that is greater than the sum of its parts. What sets the design of Agra apart from most other commonplace euros, is that it manages to create a vast amount of options with which you can interact with on your turn, but all of these options (varied though they may be) play into one another smoothly. For every straightforward way to carry out an action, there are any number of ways to carry out an augmented version of said action, if you consider using all the options available to you. In Agra, you should not only be asking yourself "How can I achieve that?" but also following up with "Okay, but how can I achieve that *better*?". It is odd to think of a euro in this way, but you almost see certain "lines of play" very frequently in Agra, and you can naturally start to predict what line of play will get you closer to where you want to be positioned, several turns from now. What's more, surprisingly, the game actually offers you a way to traverse these various lines. Whether or not that way is stymied by other players is another question. In addition, the "favour" tokens and their associated actions add a little bit of plucky liveliness to what would otherwise be more straightforward resource conversion. 

Agra turns the concept of resource management and conversion on its head by giving players true flexibility. Unlike the standard fare, Agra gives you the option to pivot, and pivot successfully, if you play well. It is rare to see a modern eurogame which does not necessarily entice you into doggedly pursuing one strategy and hoping for the best, but if you try and fail to do so in Agra, you are not completely hamstrung. It almost felt as though you would not succeed if you did not diversify your interests, or rather, establish various strong positions, and that very much intrigues me. My biggest qualm? Even for a heuristically-minded player like me, there can be an overwhelming number of options to think about, and this affects the pace of my own game as a result. If this pace increases with repeated plays, my own enjoyment and personal rating of Agra can easily follow.

(+) Nearly seamless interlocking mechanisms and some refreshing and innovative implementation of resource conversion.  
(+) Visually appealing production.
(+) Rewards long term planning and contingencies; options give you flexibility and each turn never feels completely at a loss.  

(-) Over abundance of options promotes AP 
(-) Specifically, the printed building locations and direction of conversion chains are not so clear. 
(-) Elaborate ruleset creates a high barrier to entry.

I really love this one. It is not so complex as it may seem. Everything makes sense after just a few turns. Certainly it is not 4.3 weight, maybe just 4

Update:
After 5 plays, this game still is really strong. Every game we have discovered new combos which is nice, and yet different strategies won each game. An amazing game. OTOH almost everyone I played with did not like the game. So I guess you love it or you hate it.

游戏是个多路线跑分游戏。要考虑版面资源转换，人物卡能力，国王的进贡，还能用赏赐跟冥想做一些Combo。听起来似乎是个不错的游戏，其实玩起来也很爽，但我仍然给了低分。原因之一是个人对各种小机制拼凑出来的大游戏有点审美疲劳（SF Style），而且第一把玩的时候规则要讲半天（小细节太多）时间性价比太低。其二美工看着很不舒服，污糟糟，人物又长的都很像，各种资源分辨度低，虽然可能很贴切印度现状，但是虐新啊….看的我眼睛都发直了。其三，现在的游戏真是越卖越贵。

A fairly simple worker placement and resource gathering game at heart, but with plenty of added diversions that raise the rules complexity considerably. What I like here is the less conventional approach to worker placement, in which workers remain on the board until they are bumped off. The resource tree is also pretty interesting, with sufficient differentiation between the various resources. The game starts out with a limited resource tree, but gradually grows in complexity.

What I'm more ambivalent on is the abundance of "anytime actions", which tends to mess up the planning of a turn. But really, the rating of this game is affected by the functionality of the artwork and components. Despite looking fantastic in photos, the various markers are supsceptible to falling over due to being too tall and thin. The game board suffers from having unclear boundaries between buildings and a confusing pathway for resource upgrades. Coupled with the tendency of markers to be knocked over or being obscured, and this leads to a lot of confusion over where certain markers have been.

Heavy euro in the more-bells-and-whistles-means-more-decisions style, subject to some rather misguided publishing choices prioritizing form over function.

It's a resource conversion game where wooden cylinders on a board represent 16 kinds of resource, produced either by a primary producer space or by 1-2 conversions from a primary resource (or traded in various ways). Why do you care? Key scoring opportunities are building new buildings, delivering individual goods to Emperor Akbar (one of each type for the whole game across all players), delivering a particular set of two goods to fulfil a guild order, or delivering 1-3 goods to the card of a visiting notable.

All of this of course is wrapped in a dense web of special actions, bonus incentives and timing problems. Each player starts their turn with optional meditation actions (deliveries to notables, resource conversions etc.), taken by laying down workers; if a [i]standing[/i] worker is displaced, however, the player gets 1-2 favour tokens, which can be spent on free actions. Taking the action where the merchant rests also provides favours, and the merchant's elephant leaves rupee-studded poo at each space it passes over. Each of the level 3 resources provides a specific free action. Delivering to notables on the river provides one-off or permanent bonuses and also triggers a series of events. And let's not forget the two curry actions, though I guarantee that most players do.

What's to like? Turns are usually quick, the shared opportunities does make the game interactive (multiplayer solitaire it ain't), they've made efforts to integrate the action spaces into the board artwork so it's quite attractive, and the stupid sloping board looks impressive.

And what's not to like? Oh, let me count the ways.

* The number of available actions will be difficult for the AP-prone. In the penultimate turn of the first game I had eight meditation points, six favours and three special actions from goods, including one giving me a second main action -- this is the kind of volume when "micro turns" can proceed in geologic time. (It's also a game where planning does pay off, so it's hard to hurry people up.)

* Some of these elements seem totally unnecessary (special actions from level three resources, for example, are egregiously tacked on), but neither is there really an interesting core to extract -- it's unfortunately clear that a more elegant version would be even less engaging. Perhaps most frustrating, though, is when these unnecessary elements seem to actively encourage AP by drastically changing the board state. My favourite example is the way that one meditation space will be covered, which can completely screw up the turn of any player intending a big turn of trading or converting of resources. I recognise that this is somewhat unfair: the fact that the other players can be so disrupted is a good thing and speaks to its interactivity. But...

* ...it might be 120 minutes with experience but it seems more reasonable to me to expect a first game to last 4 hours with teaching. It is not worth that level of time.

* The stupid sloping board requires stupid sloping pieces and it's quite easy to knock things off. Cute idea but grossly impractical.

* The main board very much errs on the side of form over function. I think they've done a relatively good job with the icons -- it's difficult to make 16 resources distinguishable at a distance -- but it's still easy to get some them mixed up. More problematic is the board itself, because conversion spaces are integrated so well into the artwork that spaces and conversion arrors are not clear.

* But its biggest crime is, in my opinion, all of the low and artificial limits to guarantee a slow grind. You can't hammer clothing sales (one per turn), you can't mono-focus on one good and convert 10 at once (1-3), you can't do monster deliveries (never more than 5, with difficulty), you can't pound away at one guild (pace of deliveries slowed by river).

Basically, uninteresting decisions, slow and difficult to play for all the wrong reasons.

RATING: 7.5
My first play of this was excellent.  7.5 is about as high as I can go on the first play for a game as heavy as this one, but I can definitely see my rating going up if we keep getting this to the table.  The systems and choices are clever, well-designed, and constantly engaging.  We played with 4, and it was fairly long, but all 4 of us were engaged the entire time due to the mechanics of following and replacing other players' workers.  

The board is gorgeous, and I found all the components to be functional.  The slanted Imperial board was perhaps not the best idea, but it worked fine for us.

RATING: 9
Alluring game at a glance, but the map functionality could have been better. I'd also recommend replacing each player's 3 towers (too easy to knock over on the Imperial Board) with cubes. This is pretty basic stuff, and I don't understand how they arrived at the final presentation results (what were they thinking?). 

Rules are just average, with a few missteps, and it is very easy to get rules wrong (with so much going on and the booklet organization being somewhat lacking). This design takes quite a long while to absorb. The examples in the rules are too simplistic; more complex illustrations would have helped.

Upon approach, with a dizzying array of symbols and such, the game is just... confusing (too many things are just not intuitive or there are exceptions). I would not attempt this with non-heavy gamers! So don't tackle this game unless willing to put in the time to learn and play (budget 4+ hours for your first session).

Not sure about the hidden points gimmick (all VP's are traceable). We play open.

Be forewarned that AP can be problem, especially when learning the game as things can be convoluted.

Players will be engaging in small linear growth in order to eventually avalanche a big vertical turn. Once all the moving parts become familiar, your turns are always engaging (and even frustrating sometimes when you realize that you can't do something). Interesting and fun!

A phenomenal, heavy design (I like it a lot) - big time winner in my book!

This is a good game, but I won't be in the mood all the time. There are just lots and lots of interconnected parts that it's hard to remember what you need to do in order to do what you want to do when you first start learning the game. Didn't think worker placement can get so crunchy but this one is definitely crunchy. Expect about 3+ hours on your first play.

tl;dr: solid

When the guy from [thing=146886][/thing] puts out a new game, people pay attention. Including me. The game also happens to be published in a good looking edition with nice bits. Maybe they overdid it a bit with the bits though. The large wooden bits are not only big but also not very detailed or functional. I would have preferred regular size meeples. The board is ginormous, but there is not that much dead space on it so fine I guess. The tilted display for the development tracks and stuff is WAY overdone though. Not only does it include a lot of useless cardboard, it also requires a lot of the wooden bits to have this weird angle on one side. And even with that they're still hard to put on there straight.
Also, the artwork, while pretty to look at, could have been a lot clearer in some areas. Not in the least the part with the resource conversions with arrows that are hard to see. I think they should have thought a bit more about having a nicer price point and more functional artwork and less about how amazing it looks.
But enough about components, how does it play?
This game has a pretty nice WP mechanism. Before doing your turn you can lay down some of your previous workers to get a bonus action. Then you perform an action, but you can bump other players off. And that's a good thing for those players, as they get a bonus. Unless that worker was laying down. So you can see how this leads to interesting choices. Do a bonus action now or get a bonus for being bumped?
It also seems like the game offers a bunch of different strategies to explore. Do a lot of building? Or do a lot of trading?
When I played, I didn't have a goal and I wasn't trying to win. I was just exploring a bit and focused on building, but ended up not doing that much. Still, even without trading I still managed to score quite well and surprised the other players.
I look forward to playing this again. I just wish they hadn't overdone the production and made it slightly cheaper.

Preliminary rating after one play and need a second play to confirm. First play was rough on explanation and the rulebook doesn't help to smooth things.

On the components... lots of issues:
- The gameboard has lots of unused space and could imho easily be reduced in size
- The white lines and arrows to show the good converions are hard to distinguish
- The slating imperial board, designed to give player a good overview is fiddly to manipulate.
- Icons are confusing. It's 80% there but needs another 20% of refinment.

In general, it feels overproduced. I understand what was attempted but the end result felt it has rough edges and needs another round of refinement.

On the gameplay... at its core, it's a worker placement and resource conversion game with a different paths to accomplish this. There are other games that accomplish this in a smoother and cleaner way. Because of all the extra little mechanism, it feels unnecessarily complicated and will probably be prone to AP.

Nice meaty game but...

Major negatives are very ambiguous (ie badly written) rules. Symbols on the boards and cards are often terrible and don't give enough information. You basically have to consult the rulebook for every one and even then information is sometimes hard to come by anyway.
Examples are very basic and don't show the most complex situations.

AP. It's all about cashing in on the current opportunities for the current turn. Everything changes fast and you can have few long term goals. As there a lots of options the AP is HUGE! As you can't plan ahead much the downtime is also big.

This was my first approach to D&D. Maybe I was too young, but it confused my ideas a bit... Still I found it very very interesting and I am grateful to it, because now I love D&D

The "board" is potentially useful for other games. D&D itself works better as a dungeon crawl boardgame than it does for roleplaying…

I personally don't consider this a board game, but it does have a map and stand-ups, so I guess I can see why it's here. By board game standards D&D is grossly chrome laden and tends to play long for what it delivers. That said, the variability of the game is very high, just not in this particular package assuming that one is actually dead set on playing it as a board game as opposed to the RPG that it is.

Anyway, I played this back when it was new and I was still knee deep in RPG style games. The game is basically D&D with a decently drawn map and character stands so that players without as much imagination (or who are younger, or who have to suffer through a bad DM) can see what is going on.

The game scores a 5 for me basically because it is D&D, which I consider too simplistic by RPG standards but still occasionally enjoyable. If one is going to play this as a board game, which this entry would imply, then the value for your money with this would be terrible because it can only be run through once. I must personally rate it a 5 though, because even D&D, which I think has issues, and even this package, which isn't that great, still has some minor pull for me. It's not a 4 because I don't dislike it, and it's not 6 because dungeon crawls play out too long, so it must be a 5.

I still consider D&D a flawed basic system, but if you're going to start a newbie out with it I would still probably favour the old "classic" line of box sets which take baby steps, but don't try to turn the game into a board oriented affair.

I don't know how I missed listing this as "Owned" all these years.  I probably thought this would be listed as an RPG rather than as a board game.  I never really got to play this, but I had hours of fun with reading through the adventure and trying it solo, and creating characters.

The game that introduced me to the RPG world.
For a young boy it was a really nice box plrenty of ideas and imagination, written well to make new people understand everything

A great introduction to the classic D&D game system (also known as the BECMI system), it's pnly downside is the lack of re-playability if you only have this core set if you insist on using the cardboard standees in every game.

RATING: 7
One of the best introduction to RPG games around. Still one of the easiest ways to get people interested in Dungeons & Dragons and other roleplaying games. The map sheets alone were worth the price of the game, in my opinion. And for many years, before the release of the metal and plastic D&D miniatures that eventually flooded the market, the cardboard standup characters and monsters were a great way to bring more visualisation to the tabletop when roleplaying, especially for combat encounters.

RATING: 8
Not really full on D&D but even in it's crippled form it's better than most games out there. I picked this up after I had already been playing D&D for years, half just to see what it was bringing to the table and half to use as a stepping stone to help get some friends into the game. If picking up the core D&D rule books scares you, but this doesn't, then by all means check it out, but soon enough you'll be looking to "upgrade".

Vastly underrated D&D entry point for beginners or for those who love a tactical map and miniatures.  I would much rather play this than any of the newer board game dungeon crawls.  My only complaint is the cardstock rules folder.  No.  

I actually prefer Moldvay Basic to this box, however this box allows you to climb to Level 5.

The first D&D set I owned myself. I used to play AD&D with an older friend (Dragonlance modules mostly). We did everything so wrong, and had a great time doing it. I ran this set through loads of times, eventually even adapting the map for an AD&D campaign a few years later.

Nostalgia aside, it's probably the most mediocre D&D set ever produced. And that CD! Oh, that damned CD!

This (and the 3 expansions) were my introduction into the world of Dungeons and Dragons when I was in junior high.  My original copies of all 4 games are MIA.  I did however snag a fantastic, complete set of The New Easy to Master on Ebay recently.  It feels great to have it back in my possession, reliving old memories.

I'll be working to purchase the 3 expansions next.

No longer have the parts since my brother and I got into creating our own D&D world/campaign

We got this back in 1991 (I was in the first grade).  From what I remember about it, it was a great introduction into D&D though everything was made out of paper to cut down on costs.

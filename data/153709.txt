RATING: N/A
This game has surprising depth for how simple it is, and hats off for a novel mechanic.  Not a fan of the box, which doesn't house the full height of the pyramid of cubes.  We're thinking of putting together our own pyramid-shaped box.

I picked this up at Target as a gift to my boyfriend, who is a non-gamer, who I am gradually introducing to the hobby. We play a few games like Carcassonne and Settlers Card game. We thought this game was too dry, and I noticed a pattern of the player who went first usually won, but I can't really say if this is a every-game thing because it's hard to come up with statistics when we got bored with the game after about 4 plays. Pyramix was too simple for me

RATING: 8
Only played once so might change this rating, but for now, a fast paced tactical game with a number of possible strategies appearing already. The whole family love this one, which is quite an ask. Usually the adults love a game and the children hate it and vice versa.  I suspect its not very deep, but the game aims to be a fun family game. With that criteria in mind, the game is excellent. It looks great, is easy to learn, and has replayability. How much, time will tell. 

Played several games and think I might be coming to the bottom of the game, but still a family favourite.  Would give it an 8 now. Good filler and gateway for new players or for a bit of family fun.

[ESP] Un filler diferente. Más estratégico de lo que parece a primera vista. Sencillo de jugar y explicar. No sé si me lo compraría nuevamente, pero por el momento se queda en mi ludoteca...

Pyramix is an insidiously addictive little abstract game. We've played with up to five people, but the game plays better with fewer people. 

Plastic cubes would have been a better choice than the wooden one.

Pyramix is an abstract type game of pulling cubes from a pyramid with a bit of strategy in trying to get majorities in the ankh symbols to collect bonus cubes at the end.  Play is quick with options being limited based on where blocking pieces are and if there are two sides exposed to pick the cube.  Overall an OK filler game but nothing to write home about.

Good family game as expected from Gamewright.  The 3-D concept works quite well, though the cubes are not quite uniform enough to slide as intended.  I was actually surprised at the relatively poor quality material used on the cubes -- I'm sure it was to keep the price point low, but I guess we've been spoiled by the great component quality in many games these days.  Plays great with 2 - haven't tried with more.

This is a great two player (though it plays up to four) abstract strategy game. It is one game I can say is actually fun to setup with the neat pyramid shape. I do however think the start player has too big of an advantage.

RATING: 5
This game looks great, and I'm a sucker for 3D games where the 3D really matters. This game fits the bill, but it's a little dry for me. Also, the wooded "dice" don't really slide that well. I think I'd prefer plastic.

Snagged this on clearance and was pleasantly surprised. It looks really weird (and does not always close as nicely as I'd like) but has very clean solid game play that is both simple to learn and hard to master. Worth trying for sure.

Looking back, I'm not certain what possessed me to buy this game. No one I have played it with has really liked it all that much, so getting them interested in playing it is very difficult. I am hoping that at some point that will change, despite all evidence to the contrary. My 4 year old likes the design, and we play with some very stripped down rules. 

This is a competitive game, wherein the decisions you have to make are all zero sum; either I advance my interests, or I actively thwart yours, either way, screw you. This can be a very unfriendly game, which is probably why it's not very popular in my home.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.75
Easy to learn numbers and positioning game. Battling over color control with the pawns of the game scoring 1 point but also scoring the remainder of the board in their color makes for a bit of tension, but mostly it is a simple positioning game without conflict. The sliding block mechanic is fun, however some of the pieces are not uniform and lighter than I would like making the slide feel unnatural. Good family game.

This is extremely easy to teach and a full game only takes around ten minutes. Great for killing some time or pulling someone into a quick game when they might otherwise want to do something else.

Very cool little game, with more depth than you would expect. The components are great and sets up super easily.  I am curious how this one will play out with the different people I game with. I think its a fantastic start to a game night. 15 minutes, and boom its over...but its a great time.

Pyramix is a great game in a great package.  As the begins and as it's played out, the game always looks great.  The gameplay is simple, take a piece from the pyramid following a couple of rules and adding it to your collection, but through this simplicity there's a really strategic game to be played.  While cranes and eyes score the most points, collecting ankhs is key.  Excellent little game.

An abstract game with a 3-D element. Having to consider what your choice will reveal for your opponent makes this fun for me. I don't tend to like abstracts because they feel too dry. This one is definitely themeless, but it didn't feel dry, and that's an important distinction.

Aún no comprendo del todo la estrategia y hasta el momento no he ganado ninguna partida. De cualquier forma me parece inovador y que tienes que estar más atento a lo que haces de lo que parece. Me gusta mucho cómo se arma la pirámida y la calidad de los componentes. 

7 - Good. Usually willing to play.

RATING: 8
I was in the market for a family-friendly abstract that my 8-year-old could could play competitively, so we'd have more options than Connect Four and dexterity games (both of which I like, but variety is good!). Pyramix delivers.

The components are excellent, with the exception of the annoying novelty box. (The window makes it annoying to put everything away.) It's fun to build the pyramid, and equally fun to unravel it.

The game takes almost no time to learn and teach, and plays are quick. Despite that, it has a larger decision space than I expected. What's hiding in the center? Will this turn be my last chance to stay competitive in color X? Is it better to take an ankh or a higher-value cube?

They're not complex decisions, but they're interesting. I like Pyramix more than I expected to. With a group of adults, I'd be more likely to suggest other abstracts ahead of it, but as a family game it's a pleasant surprise.

[b]Pyramix[/b] was traded in a math trade with Asara, Ninjato and Pyramix 2/1/15. (Received The Golden Ages)
Received in a math trade (8/8/14). A second copy was sold via auction 4/28/17.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I actually regret trading this one, but this happens once and a while when trying to fit your collection in a small space. Everything I said a year ago holds true, this is a quick, easy to teach gateway game with a really cool "board" (basically a pyramid of dice that slide down as you pull one out). I'll probably pick this one up again when my youngest daughter gets a bit older, if not sooner.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (7):[/COLOR]

[i]- Plays excellent with 2 and 3 (haven't played with 4 yet).
- Great family game (not surprisingly since it comes from Gamewright).
- Plays really fast (under 15 minutes) and doesn't outstay it's welcome.
- Great gateway/family game, really easy to teach/learn.
- Simple to play, but packed with meaningful decisions. 
- Really nice production quality, this game looks good set up.[/i]

I've played thrice, and each game has ended up with the player results reflecting turn order - the player who went first won each time. Which is not entirely unexpected given the game is one of set collection, picking out the best scoring die off the pyramid, with no turn order leveller mechanism. The decision each turn is what to pick so as not to leave anything juicy for the next player. There's also a frequent decision on whether to go for a 2 point cube or a 1 point Ankh, where you may choose to go for an Ankh if there's a fair chance you'll have the most Ankhs in that colour to get a scoring bonus at the end of the game. There's no cheer/groan factor, so despite it's 15 min appeal and family style packaging, it doesn't feel like a family game. Rather, it's one of quiet contemplation while you spin the board looking for the best play. It feels like it wants to be taken semi-seriously, but it's a bit hard to do so when first player seems to win more than their share.

A light tactical game that teaches and plays fast, which is idea for young players or as a gateway game for non-gamers. It still contains enough strategy (along with quick game-play) that would appeal to most casual-medium gamers.

6.5 after 2 plays.

The rules are easy to explain and gameplay is relatively quick. Downtime is therefore low. Player interaction is moderate and mostly indirect. Scalability is suspect though and 2 players is probably the best player count. A bigger number of players would make what is available to take somewhat incidental. Artwork is simple but functional, while game component quality is adequate.

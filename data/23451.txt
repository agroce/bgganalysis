Cool idea, but needed polish.  Only played twice and enjoyed it. Gameplay itself is very unique and clever with the real time strategy aspect to it.

One major complaint is the components - it was pretty stupid to include an entire set of components for 8 players in one box and jack the price up to $60.  They should have put half the components for 5-8 players in each box, or released a separate expansion.

Certainly an original and fun game.  I'd be happy to play this most times it was put forward as a half hour game.  There's enough here to keep you thinking and entertained, but I do wonder if it will lose a bit of gloss after repeat playings.  The simultaneous nature of play is great, but despite that, the resource management part may eventually lead me to feel that the game is not really all that interesting.  Nevertheless, for now, I quite liked this.

It is a bit fidgety, and it takes forever to get setup (building the decks SUCKS), but once the game starts all I have to say is wow.  Get past all the setup, the bad timers to get replaced, and the two shades of blue and this game could be a perfect 10!

RATING: 7
Boardgames that employ time pressure are as rare as hen's teeth.  Space Dealer uses it in two ways.  The 30 minute limit and simultaneous play mean that everyone is rushing to do as much as possible.  The timers that must be flipped to complete just about any action make you wait - and that can be excruciating. The underlying game is a ho-hum one of building a production engine and shipping goods to your neighbours - the near ones, the guy sitting opposite is just too far away.  I hope that the advanced game cards will add some wrinkles, but I haven't used them yet.  The English rules are not well written and questions do arise during the game. Not a happy state of affairs for the explainer, who is also trying to hurry up and win!

My rating after a several plays.  This is a wonderful game and the uniqueness is quite striking.  I loved every heart thumping, mind wrenching, gut busting minute (Carved into nice little thirty second increments).  I highly endorse the creation of additional 30 minute CDs for background music, as it adds nicely to the atmosphere.
I'm looking forward to more plays of this in the near future.

A nice experiment in real-time gameplay and time management. Has some potential to tax your multi-tasking skills, but is otherwise quite a basic pick-up-and-deliver game. Nice - not great, but still fun. And it plays in only 30 minutes, flat! ;-)

RATING: 7
Obviously, a very different kind of game.  Real time (the game WILL last only 30 minutes) use of sand timers for every move is very interesting, and fun in an unusual way.  

But, for us first timers to the game...the possibility of breaking rules, left and right, under the cloud of chaos of a real time play made the game results doubtful.  Did the winner play completely legally?  I do not know.  Does that bother me? Probably, but still, the experience was fun.  The first few games probably need a proctor to watch over all the first time gamers.

Make sure you calibrate your timers.  They all seem to move at different speeds.  I have mine marked in pairs so that one player will get both the fastest AND the slowest timer.  The real-time aspect is nice for when you want something a lil different, but it's also a bit gimmicky

The game is considerably better when played using the advanced rules.  I suspect anyone who has rated less than 6 has not played by the advanced rules yet.  The Basic game truly is dull.  The advanced game adds quite a few features and makes some hard decisions.  One word of warning, the advanced game does feel a little more chaotic as there is a lot more going on and it makes it harder to check out what other people are doing.  Very often I found myself looking up from what I was doing to find that everyone else had surpassed me in an area to completely dominate in that area.

My only complaint about the game is that the sandtimers are not very accurate (and in my set one of them is fully broken as to stop running with sand still up top).  If you can replace the timers with fully functional ones, this is actually quite a good game.

Real time strategy boardgame style. Very original concept which plays like a charm. Despite all people acting at the same time this game does not get hectic or chaotic. You have to pay a lot of attention to what others are doing or you will no doubt waste precious actions. Very highly recommended!

Everytime I suggested this game to play, it got shot down. If it doesn't get played, it has to go.

Interesting concept of concurrent player actions. The hour glasses prevent it from becoming a fast-grab madness, you have some time to plan ahead, but not much.
The downside of the concurrent play is that you need players that 1) understand the rules and 2) have the selfcontrol to stick to them even if nobody would see that they cheat a bit to make that devastating planning error not have happened...

RATING: 4
Not a game I enjoy. Good point is it takes 30 minutes, bad points - if you play fast this will annoy you as you're sitting around waiting for the timers to run out before you can play again (if you suffer from analysis paralysis don't try this game). Not actually much game there, virtually no interaction - I don't think I'd play unless it was the advanced version. Big problem with the sand-timers - they vary significantly, get a slow timer and you'll get less actions than everyone else.

Got a chance to play this 4 times at BGG Con.  What a breath of fresh air.  For the first time in a long time I felt like I was playing something original.  The egg timer mechanic keeps the game tense and quick.  I can see the basic game getting old after 4 plays once the game mechanics are learned.  At that point the advanced game takes over with its higer degree of interaction and screwage potential.  This game isnt for everyone and I see this being most popular at larger gatherings like BGG Con.  My only ohter reservation is that in the basic game the tech lvl 3 card Fusion Mine is too powerful.  However the designer has suggested a fix for this.  Hopefully it will be made into official errata.  Once this is available in the US I can see getting a copy.

Very interesting, but doesn't seem like it has much staying power.  Rules took 1 hr to decipher for 3 new players, and we still got enough wrong that we called it after 15 min.  A second playing might have been much more fun, but we were tired of it already.

11/14/06 - part of the first arrival of Essen games ordered. After a few games - things to watch out for:

- in 2 games 2 different people spent a fair amount of time trying to acquire the SOLARSATELITE to upgrade their GENERATOR. To mitigate this you need to reach tech level 2 and begin drawing from card deck 2 as soon as you can.
- probably should add the GIZI neutral planet delivery points to the basic game. Even with newbies the delivery demands became scarce with over 5 minutes left in the game. Adding these will also mitigate low demands at other players planets.

It's funny how the first two timers seem to take forever to run out but soon afterward they seem to be always out. Still can't believe my daugther requested to play the game.

A game worth trying once or twice, but to be honest the game is - to use the overused F word - fiddly.  The real time thing is a nice gimmick, but is far better in a game like Tamsk or a party game than in something like this where you're actually in risk of bloody knuckles.  And with the worst scoring mechanism ever going at the same time!   It's easy to make mistakes and it's really hard to do some things (like deliveries, score) fast and accurately.  I always preferred to be accurate rather than fast, to my detriment.  It would be too easy to cheat in this game and the temptation certainly was there. Therefore, the design would be much better as a multi-player computer game (à la BSW or Cosmic Online) than as an actual physical board game. Also, the only strategy seemed to be to get to level three fast and get the best factories.  The advanced game added some interesting stuff making it better than the basic game, but without the timers I bet the game wouldn't create any buzz. Definitely try before you buy.

RATING: 2
The game starts with an adrenaline rush, as you know you'll be playing against others and their sand timers.  Then, it's a flurry of activity, where you don't have much, if any, time to watch other players.  No interaction whatsoever.  Then, all of a sudden, the 30 minutes are up, and you see that you lost.  Huh?  I must have made a dozen mistakes, that no one caught.  Way too busy of a game for my taste.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun idea that's kinda clumsy in the actual execution.  Surprisingly few opportunities to trade among other players.  Seems its optimal to just advance the tech track at the begining as quickly as possible, then draw as many 3s as you can build.  Would like to try the advance game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun having the element of time integrated into the game, but I don't find the game that interesting to play.  Trying to pay attention to what your opponents are doing while managing your own system, all under time pressure, is quite an adrenaline rush.  But there are elements to the game that I do not like.  The sabotage and interstellar rocket cards can hose a player badly and are available only as "luck of the draw" (you might never get one).  Moving the scoring markers is a pain and in the heat of the moment people can screw up.  You can just not bother with them since all points can be calculated at the end of the game, but then the sabotage/rocket cards become less useful since you don't know who the leader is that you should be slowing down.  I like the uniqueness of the game, but don't see myself playing it much even though it is only 30 minutes.

RATING: 7.5
very different from almost any other game and first impressions are very positive, even though the feeling is one of beflustered bewilderment, albeit of the very enjoyable variety.  A few more plays begins to make more sense of the game, though it remains fairly frantic, as by then you're trying to keep an eye not just of how your timers are going, but what your neighbours are building and - if that's not enough -  what your diagonally opposite opponent is up to - for it is them you really need to keep an eye on to win.  Latest game was a bit less frantic, though the time pressure still leads to mistakes - first time I've ever sailed my ship right round the ring of planets and back home!  Not one I need to play all the time and one which you're unlikely to play again and again - though the temptation to play again immediately after your first game may be irreesistable - but you need to try it if you haven't so far had the pleasure - it's simply unique, and all the better for that.

This was rather fun. I think the real-time aspect of the game is well-done, and on the whole the game feels pretty well-paced. It moves along well but isn't too frantic, and the station development and goods delivery aspect work rather well. Pausing to think from time to time seems rewarded. The physical inconsistancy in the timers is a bit of a bummer, but really, this is an experience game, not a highly-competitive enterprise. Oh, yeah, and the soundtrack is a great addition.

Honestly, though, I doubt the game has serious replayability. It strikes me as something I'll play a bunch now because it's a gimmick game, and the  gimmick has been pretty well-executed. But on the other hand, the game doesn't seem to have that much range - even with the advanced game a few 30-minute playes will see most of what the game has to offer, I suspect, because the game doesn't end until the players are more or less out of choices and options.  There is also some definite concern that Tech Level 2 is underpowered; skipping it and going directly to level 3 seems to be the way to go. The real-time gimmick has been well done, but I am certainly suspicious that the underlying game balance is not quite there. But honestly, this is a game you're playing for the gimmick, not for the game. Obviously, it would be best to have both, but for me the gimmick is great and the game works well enough.

Don't bother with the "basic" game; go direct to the advanced game, which is where the action is, although I also recommend playing without the 4 "sabotage" cards for the first game or two, and we don't play with the neutral planet demand cards either (and I have no desire to add them). Oh, and don't bother trying to keep the scoring track up to date. Just score at the end. It's too hard and too easy to lose track, and keeping it going just distracts from the fun of the game (and people who concientiously score are penalized, because they look ahead of the forgetful). Regardless of all this, though. for the time being, I'm definitely enjoying Space Dealer. It's a wonderful idea, well-executed.

Cool gimmick with the sand timers, but I'm not sure there's much replayability here.  Would like to try with the advanced rules to see if there is any more to it.  Also, I thought the rulebook was pretty poorly written, leaving some key points pretty vague.

Played the advanced game.  Found it chaotic, which I expected and therefore don't have a problem with.  However: a few things:

Through bad luck, I never drew a Fusion mine the entire game, and didn't draw a satelite until near the end of the game.  Reason: A player had 2 Fusion generators in his planning area while already having 2 fusion generators, but through tech had 4 slots in his planning area, and therefore had no incentive to spend time to discard them.  Overall, I do it again, but think there are a few items needing fixing.

RATING: 6
Space Dealer is a simultaneous action game where players have sand timers. When someone wants to take an action they simply flip a timer over and put it on the appropriate spot, when the timer runs out then the action happens. Basic things that you can do include increasing your power capacity, increasing your technology level, creating new mines, and moving your ship around so that you can fill the needs of other players and thereby generate victory points.

The pace on this isn't horribly manic, and it isn't all that hard to get used to once you're in the flow of it, but the English rules are less than amazing, and this is a game that is much easier to learn from another player.

As for my take: I enjoyed it. Playing with the basic rules meant that the card decks were a touch too small, and by the last minute or so we were out of ways to gain victory points. I think starting with the basic game is absolutely required though, because the game does take a bit of getting used to.

I do agree with Josh Miller that the game could easily end up becoming very samey with repeat play, but I'm not sure if that would be the case with the advanced rules. I would like to try it with those rules to evaluate that possibility, because I do enjoy the game and the flow, and hope that some extra variability is built into it with those augmentations.

In any case, I hope that this game will be picked up for an American release as it has some original ideas and is a decently fun, always 30 minute long game. A bit of a gimmick type game though, and not a lot of built-in variability from game to game. More than willing to play it because of its length and charm, but nothing I would be likely to suggest either.

Fun sounding concept but woeful gameplay using sandtimers that don't keep the same time. There's a lot of chaos and the game seems broken, at least in the standard version.

Mission to Red Planet with a similar theme is much better.

Pretty cool pick up an deliver game in real time.  Terrible rules for what is actually a fairly simple game.

Tried a test game with 2 players.  We each played 2 planets.  We took turns sequentially rather than using the sand timers.  Now that we have the idea well enough to teach, I'd like to try it with 3 or 4 using the timers.  The spontanaeity should be fun!

This is a game which has been on my to try-list for as long as it came out. It has beautiful, evocative artwork, and the idea of there being a definite amount of time in which to play is appealing. I held off purchasing a copy every time I had the opportunity, though. So it was with some excitement that I was finally able to try it out for real.

The rules are horrible when it comes to setting up the game. The cards could have been clearly marked for use for which amount of players, saving newcomers an annoying amount of hassle. One point deduction for this unnecessary puzzle element. After some grumbling, we got them sorted out, and proceeded to play the game. At first I found it interesting, but after a few minutes, I found my interest disappearing as I realised there is no [i]game[/i] to speak of in the basic edition. Draw cards, place them, get goods, move spaceships, deliver goods, rinse, repeat. Is it all about doing this more quickly than your opponent who may have suffered from a few shitty draws from the card decks? Thanks you kindly for wasting my half hour of game time, then. Trades are always possible—hello degenerative strategy where goods are recycled between two players to rake up the points. After about ten minutes or so I began leafing through the rulebook to see if there was anything I missed, but unfortunately not in the basic game. Perhaps that the advanced game is a bit more challenging...? Anyway, as I decided there and then that I refuse to play a game where the players are expected to pretend the glaring holes in the design do not exist, I announced my intention of not continuing play, and looking forward to not playing this for the forseeable future: my first impressions were not good, and that is a polite way of stating them. This is a title which tries to do something radically different, only to screw it up magnificently. Further development was a clear requirement, in my opinion.

Has an outstandingly fresh and interesting mechanic (timers for actions). Alas, with the basic rules, it also has a Single Best Strategy - there's just [i]way[/i] too much benefit to powering straight to tech-3 as fast as conceivably possible. All other strategies will lose to this, and lose hard. This makes all the games feel somewhat the same.

With some house rules, however, it's possible to even out the incentives/rewards to make low-, medium-, and high-tech strategies all viable routes. You'll still always want to upgrade to at least Tech 2, but not necessarily right away.

[Rating based on as-is ruleset; with house rules, I'd consider it a 6.5 - 7.0]

Whoa, this game is so unique. It's nice engine building with realtime aspects there. No turns, just the timer with sandtimer. It's quite good mechanic. But since no turns, everybody just watch their own progress. Interactivity with other players is usually less efficient. So unfortunate.

RATING: 7
Game of production and delivery, definitely the type of game I enjoy.  I'm not sure I totally understood the rules, and it's very chaotic as you play under the pressure of real sand timers.  The timers in our game were all different times, so nobody got the same amount of sand in their timers as anyone else.  Did this affect the outcome of the game?  Not sure.  I'd like to try it again with another copy to see if the quality control is better, and I'd like a chance to get the rules a bit more clear.  All those little complaints aside, the basic mechanisms of the game are all things I like to play, and the high rating is based on that as much as anything else.

RATING: 7
Fun game after the first play.  Worth taking some time to know the rules and have some familiarity with the game.  There is no chance during play to clarify rules or look up what a card does.  This is not a serious game so don't approach it that way.  Have fun!  I think it requires the right group and with that this game is a boatload of fun.

First play was fun, thanks to the gimmick of the sand clocks.
Unluckily, there is not a game in there: trivial decisions, fiddly rules, not so good materials and incredibly long setup time (for half an hour game) make for a mediocre game.

RATING: 8
Very innovative real-time game, based on the concept of mining and delivering resources. Each player has two sand timers that are used to trigger two different events per turn. Players play simultaneously and the game ends in exactly 30 minutes. This games really deserves the praise that it is getting.

Space Dealer uses sand timers in a very innovative way.  This is where most of the intrigue of the game lies.  But the quality of the game itself could be better.  

To begin with, the set up for this game is ridicules for a 30 minutes game.  It takes nearly as long to set up and break down the game as to play the game.  

Secondly, the game is a little too complicated for a 30 minute game.  Although there are only about 15 different cards to learn, there is no text on the cards explaining what they do.  I assume this is so that the game can sell in a multitude of countries.  Unfortunately, this also means that you have to memorize 15 cards based upon the graphics before you start a game that only takes 30 minutes to play.  Normally you'd ask people during the game what the cards do if you were unsure.  In this case, it is hard to ask others for help because everyone is under pressure from the sand timers.

Finally, for a game called Space Dealer, there is not much "dealing" that goes on in the game.  In fact, there is very little true interaction in the game.  I would have liked the negotiating aspect of the game to be more important.

But with all this said, the game is fun.  I really enjoy the novelty of the sand timer in a strategy game.  I'll probably play it quite a few more times before I get tired of the novelty, so it will be worth the purchase price.  But I eagerly await an improved version of this game...

RATING: 6
Players develop a space mining complex, and send ships out to trade mined goods for victory points.  Interesting, different game played in 30 minutes flat real time.  Most of the a players actions, however, are restricted by a pair of sand timers - they kick an action off but have to wait for the sand to drain before the action kicks in.  This sounds clever, and it is, however the timers are a little too long and there is a bit of thumb twiddling waiting to spring into action again.  Worth a look if you want something a little different.  Looks great, simple to get into, but replayability may be an issue.

It took a little bit of effort to put together a teaching/player aid, and to go through the rules & restrictions, but was well worth it.  I can't explain the appeal this game has - Is it a Euro?...kinda...Is it thematic?...kinda...It is...I dunno.  30 minutes of chaos and I walked away asking myself:
Did I have fun? - Yep.
Do I want to play this one again? - Yep.

Hated every dire, random, chaotic second of it.
The only worse time I have had is when I was involved in a game of Ricochet Robot.

I would rather burn my eyes out than play this again.

RATING: 4
Overall, very much a single mechanic game. It struggles to have the rest of the game be simple enough to really showcase it, but doesn't quite manage it.

Additionally, the core economic mechanic suffers badly with 4 players if one player doesn't build much demand. That player loses, but so do the players next to him. 3 players seems like it should be better.

The one thing I can say about this game that sets it apart from 99% of other games is it WILL last the amount of time it advertises on the box.  So if you're ready for 30 minutes of space traveling, wheeling and dealing chaos, this might be the game for you.

One of my favorites. Only has a 'low' score of 8 as I hate teaching this one, as the card text (what little there is) is in German and once the game starts no one can ever remember what the cards do and inevitably I have to tell/retell what some of the cards do. THAT being said, I own 4 copies of this game. Its that good.

Gimmicky but it works. For some reason, the rules are difficult to explain, mainly because of the novel concept, but once players get into the game, it should flow nicely. Good tension from the real-time "time's a wastin'!" aspect. Not sure if it has longevity though.

An interesting concept. The imbalance in the timers is a little worrying but not sure it's affected us noticeably. The basic game is blah, always play the 'advanced' one. 3 players is as good as 4. Play with the fusionmine and sabotage rules from the expansion.

So far only a two-player non-advanced game for me, but I can already say that I like the real-time aspect and expect to really enjoy the game more when players, cards and the expansion are added.
-
After a 4 player non-advanced game with 2 completely new players, I feel that the game is very tense and interesting, but all the techs were researched with about 10 minutes left. The next time I play with experienced players, I will add the advanced cards and see if the techs offer more choices at the end of the game or not.

This first game was pretty rough, but am very intrigued by it.  Since everyone plays simultaneously for 30 mins there is no time to consult rules as questions arise.  We all felt something was wrong because at 22 mins we were finished with no victory point actions available so the game was over.  We will study the rules & read here on BGG to see if we were doing something wrong.  We all have a feeling that time should be a premium and that there should always be more actions than time to do them. Have a 2nd box so 8 can play.

EDIT: The rule book is very poor.  Quick Reference.pdf by Delta 1119 saved the day and made the game easy.

The engine of this game is a brilliant idea.  Unfortunately the players must be policed strictly as the temptation to cut corners while playing is too strong.  It is critical to perform all the parts of an action before turning over the timer.  Also, I would gladly play the basic game; the expert version has some stupid "improvements" which can seriously ruin the game for the victims of the saboteurs.

No jogo nos temos um planeta e nele construímos edificações e minas. O recursos que conseguimos produzir podem ser transportados na sua nave e levados a outros planetas pois cada construção tem uma demanda por recursos. Caso você supra a demanda de alguma dessas construções você recebera pontos no final do jogo. O grande diferencia do jogo é que ele ocorre em tempo real. Cada jogador tem duas ampulhetas, de 1 minuto, para realizar suas ações. Você deve colocar uma ampulheta sobre a edificação ou nave para construir, produzir ou movimentar. Tudo que é feito no jogo é resolvido desse modo. A interação acaba sendo pequena, apesar de você suprir as demandar nos planetas dos outros e poder trocar recurso, pois todos ficam preocupados com as ampulhetas. No jogo vem um CD que você coloca para tocar durante o jogo. Ele lembra o tempo restante e toca uma música com tema espacial que vai acelerando a medida que o tempo vai acabando. Me surpreendeu. Muito curioso. A primeira impressão foi muito boa. A segunda e terceira também. 

O Space Dealer é um jogo de tabuleiro atípico que ocorre em tempo real.
No jogo cada jogador representa um planeta onde somos comerciantes espaciais. 
Nós devemos produzir mercadorias e suprir demandas nos planetas dos outros jogadores.
Para tal, devemos pesquisar tecnologias, construir edificações e transportar as mercadorias.
O grande lance do jogo é que para cada uma dessas ações que você escolhe realizar você coloca 1 de 2 ampulhetas suas, de 1 minuto, sobre esta ação e quando passar 1 minuto você pode realizar a ação.
Isso ocorre simultaneamente com todos os 4 jogadores, neste caso com 8 jogadores. Resumindo o jogo é tenso, emocionante e ocorre em tempo real.
A partida ocorre em exatos 30 minutos que são marcados com uma trilha sonora que acompanha o jogo e completa o clima espacial com um ritmo futurista que vai acelerando a medida que o tempo vai se esgotando.

Unique mechanisms. Makes you think of a real-time strategy video game turned into cardboard.

Although the game was fun the hectic nature of the game requires one to really understand all of the cards before playing the game. Plus I really am not crazy about games with time limits so this gets a 6. Actually thinking more about this game The scoreboard is terrible, the docking places for your ship is terrible. My rating goes down a whole lot.  Say 4.5.  And since you can easily cheat by not waiting for your timer to finish (No one else would notice because there is little time to look around at other people since you are so involved with your own situation). Hey its even worse than 4.5 lets make that 4.0 and now I think about the random nature of the card draw, you draw cards that you don't need and there is nothing that you can do about it except waste some of your very limited time trying to get other cards. Hey every time I think about this I dislike it even more. 3.0 is what it gets!! More bad. You have little contact with the player sitting directly across from you.  And furthermore this is basically a solitaire game. Minimal inter-reaction with any other player. My final rating after contemplating and reflecting about this game is that its final rating will be the worst rating I have ever given a game. 1.5

NB for the second 4p game we played taht all ships were just 2 moves away from each base - instead of travelling around the cuircle everyone passed through the middle - this seemed to made the game flow a lot better, opening up bases for more trading competition.

Played once with the basic rules.  It started off well, which I credit to the game's novelty.  But after ten or fifteen minutes, things were getting very easy and a bit boring.  There just weren't enough interesting actions to perform, and no read breadth of strategies open to the players.  The advanced game might address those problems, at least in the short term, but I'm not sufficiently intrigued to make the effort.  For me at least, Space Dealer is more of a novelty than an interesting game with lasting appeal.

RATING: 4
Each player has a maximum of 60 actions to perform within 30 minutes. Everybody is playing simultaneous and is using two personal 1 minute sand timers to keep track of his time.

The trick is to perform one action while the time of the other action runs out. Quickminded players will be able to perform an actions in a few seconds giving him plenty of time to plan the next move while waiting for the sand to run out. The more feeble players will have a hard time catching up.

All actions are extremely basic and easy to grasp (which they need to be in a speed game) which means that the game would be very boring without the use of timers. 

The timers makes the game only slightly boring.

NOTE: I have only played the basic game. I have been told that the advanced makes the game more interesting. However it won't change my issues with the timers, so it probably have a great impact on my view upon the game. But I have increased my rating by one as would like to play it once more.

Bad, allmost broken.  A real time game where you have to understand every little detail to play properly.  A dealing game where you have no time to make deals so you move to whomever is closest.

sticking with an 8 rating after 5 or so plays.  I still am enjoying the game.  I am noticing that the luck factor of the cards can be significant.  If you are looking to upgrade your power plant but just can't get your hands on one, this can really negatively impact your ability to build other buildings as you have to put a timer on each unwanted building before you can scrap it.  

I've played one or two games with a full table of those who played at least once before.  Have not played advanced rules yet.

 Interesting.  Different.  Mismatched timers a slight annoyance.  But, in a fixed 30 minute game, I'm not sure it add up to more then one or two extra actions.  Not sure that's make or break.  It's some what tense as the game goes on.  Very solitaire in play though. Played and 8 player game and while it was mass chaos (and I like chaos), the board was just to big to have ANY interaction with the other side.  Not sure it should be played with more then 4 people.

Enjoyably different mechanics made up for a few flaws for me. The 30 minute time limit allows several plays in a short time. Occasionally a little over-frantic, my timers got knocked over more than once. Difficult to ensure everyone is playing by the right rules sometimes on first play.

Really liked it but I can imagine that this is a bit of a one trick pony.
Would have liked the tech track to be longer and more of a struggle. Definitely must play with the cards for the non-player planets. Only played with 3 players so far.

RATING: 4.5
I found the rules confusing and vague on our first play.  For example, I went around stealing resources out of the depots of other players because the rules say that goods can be picked up by ships on that planet!  Need to learn the real rules and try again.  But generally, I don't like real-time games, because I like to mull over strategy and chat with my fellow players.  Also, remember to go to the bathroom before the beginning of the game, or you'll have to wait to the end of the 30 minutes!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
An interesting try at making a "real-time" game.  Unfortunately the timers don't have the same amount of sand, and it can be frustrating to see someone beat you at a delivery when everyone appeared to be playing in their own little sand box two timers ago...

Still a neat concept, just not into this type of thing.

Interesting board game realization of a real-time strategy computer game. I've yet to play it with the advanced cards but it's not bad. It's just a bit too hard for first timers or non-RTS players to grasp in one play. Rick Thornquist supervised a bunch of games at BGG.con 2006 and this is the way that it needs to be taught. Difficult to play and teach, just a pain to see if mistakes are made. Great production and design.

There is a decent amount of game put into 30 minutes, but there is way too much fiddling with components for me. Quickly turn around timers, card placements on the double... too much mental effort to do things right and avoid cheating than its worth.

As an added problem, there is a significant luck element to the whole thing. For example, in the basic version it's really hard to do well if a player have no cities or the player with the most cities is sitting across. Given that the players have little saying about this, it's kind of a bummer.

Finally, I stopped fretting about the sand timer issue and just played this.  I'm glad I did!  It provides a unique and intense experience.  When the 30 minutes are up you feel slightly exhausted - but, for that reason, it feels like excellent value for money, time-wise.  If it were not for the time-consuming and fiddly set-up it might be the perfect filler - incidentally, this set-up overhead has been addressed in the reimplementation: [thing=137238][/thing], which I do not yet own.

If you have ever wondered just how far board games could go towards simulating the real-time strategy game experience perfected in computer games then this may be the answer.  I now how two copies to allow play with up to 8 people - now *that* would be chaotic!

First off, I wholly expect this game to drop by a point with each successive play as things become more mechanical due to figuring out how to navigate the decision tree, BUT for a play every now and again this is pure real-time BLISS.  Why aren't more games like this?!  I love the bits, the unique gameplay, and the interesting dichotomy between solo optimization and free wheeling player interaction.  Give the designer a medal already; this is brilliant!

The English rules are a little rough, and setup is cumbersome, but the novelty in this game deserves at least an 8.  If you are bothered by real times games -- brawl, etc.  Avoid it, but if not, seek this game out.  One other small irritation, compete the timers, because 30 secs might be the exception rather than the rule.  Finally, I am not sure the advanced rules really add much worth adding.  The neutral planet cards seem to dimminish the limited player interaction in the game already.

RATING: 5
 A big "E" for effort here and certainly some points for bringing a unique game idea to market (save for Tamsk) however it really boils down to being 'just a race' and even though it only lasts 30 minutes there really isn't a whole lot to keep you interested after you get past the great gimmicky aspect of the game. 

PROS: 

 - 30 minute game time 
 - Realtime aspect 
 - Timers adding some tension

CONS: 

 - Replay 
 - Very little strategy 
 - Big luck factor
 - 18 page rule book not written well
 - set-up time

Not sure why I should even complain about a 30 minute game when there are so many worse longer ones I could be playing but playing really gives me the feeling of just 'going through the motions', kinda like TTR and also luck is a BIG factor here like in that game as well. Everyone is saying the replay might be bad but no one really touched on WHY; this is why, its like "okay, that was neat, now let's actually play a GAME", as opposed to this which is purely a race.  

In the end I think this game is enjoying some higher ratings due to the inherent fresh factor but honestly there really is more gimmick than game here. There just isn't enough interesting decisions or strategy to bring someone back. Even though you have some some choices on where to put timers, actual decisions consist of, where to put a timer next, and where to put a timer next, and where to put a timer next...

In summary - Unique...check, Gimmicky in a good way...check, 30 minute game time good...check, does this make the game good...No sorry. A lot of things could of been forgiven if the game was FUN, sadly it just isn't. As gimmicks go, they usually burn fast and hard but die fast too and I think "Aldie" might sum it up best by saying in his comments, "One trick pony - but it's a good trick."

Definitely a gimmick game, but a fun and unique gimmick.  I'm no fan of science fiction-themed games, but here it's tolerable due to the novelty of the game.  The soundtrack is a nice touch, even if it is a little bland.  The different amounts of sand in each timer is a little annoying.  Also, it seems that after multiple plays, it would be hard to avoid getting stuck into the same routine of playing the same strategy, perhaps it may not have that much replayability.  But for now it's a blast!

RATING: 7.5
A real time cube-delivery game where players use timers to take actions. Its a very unique concept, but it seems to lead to a very solitaire game. Despite the rules to encourage trading, players are so engrossed in their own play area that almost no trading is done. Also, its very hard to control mistakes or even cheating since no one can stop to check what is happening.

To some extent, I think the expansion fixes some of the errors in the main game.

Real Time Strategy is not my favorite type of computer game so I suppose that it shouldn't be a shock that I didn't love my first play of Space Dealer either.  Upon hearing the rules, I thought this would be an engaging and unique game experience.  My first play showed that it was in fact unique but not particularly engaging.  There was also a rules problem that arose which could only be handled after the entire game ended (which is a problem of this game as a consequence of its reliance on simulataneous play).

Provisional rating after two plays of "7.37", might drop a little with repeated plays... total chaos trying to play with the unitiated, but I see great potential in this game once you get three or four people to learn it.  I think it might play a lot better with three, as it's easier to navigate to your opponent's planets and deliver goods for points.

I'm sorry about the rating, it should be a 7 but the game is "broken" as supplied - it just is not possible to give different timers to players and think that adding the times together evens it out.

Engrossing game. If you have ever played a real-time strategy game on your computer, you know how Space Dealer works. Except that there is no resource gathering, the timers itself (of which you have only two) are the resource. There are some major drawbacks to the basic rules, though. Firstly, they are not very well balanced. It is possible to run out of contracts way before the end of the game which can throw the end game out of whack. Secondly, player interaction is very low, which is not what you would expect from a game with the word "Dealer" in the title. All of this is addressed in the advanced rules, which I would very much like to try. My rating only reflects the basic game.

This is the first real-time game I've played that works, and I really really want to use the sand timer mechanic for something more complicated.  The tough part of this game in conjunction with the usualy way Euros are played is that you really need a stand aside teacher that can watch things, as it is really really difficult to teach and correct errors as you play.

RATING: 6.75
Truly, a game takes 30 minutes to play, due to the CD soundtrack. Spend about 20 minutes to set up and explain the rules, and about 5 minutes to determine everyone's score. With more experienced players, you can add some interesting options.

Interst faded fast after first play at BGG.con. The "8" rating may be a product of hype. I would like to lower it but would prefer to play again first, and since there's no immediate prospect of that I'll just have to say that I believe my rating is probably too high, and leave it at that.

Typically I am somewhat adverse to futuristic sci fi things.  There are a few exceptions - I enjoyed Ender's Game and Dune and parts of Star Wars.  But the rest of the genre leaves me shrug.The English rules for this game need work. The grammar is very unclear and the setup is slightly fiddly.  Clear rules can make the difference on whether or not a game hits the table at all.  It was definitely a slog.My timers have significant differences between them.  One timer has a piece of plastic in it and it gets stuck frequently.  Not good.I have only played the basic game once but I must say things were relatively frantic.  Players had lots of questions mid game which makes it hard to address in a real time system.  I am sure this will dissipate with more play.  Not sure if we were playing correctly (base game) but almost all of the tech 2 and 3 cards were used before the end.  The game is definitely unique and for this reason I will keep it.  But I hope the advanced game offers a lot more choice or I could forecast table time to peter-out quickly.

Played this once. I am going to pickup a copy.  

Wonderful concept.  Lots of fun.  Great components.  I Think this game is a great closer.  I also think it is a game you can play with a casual gamer or your family.

It is kind of an real time strategy game, but a board game.  The most tense part of the game was me just arriving at a planet before another player and stealing his delivery.  (My timer finished about 2 seconds before his did.)

Rating for base game only!Really neat concept and design. I like how the game is fixed to exactly 30 minutes, and how it sounds so simple to take only 2 actions every minute but how things quickly degenerate and it becomes very difficult to manage your two timers. However I find that it is difficult at the end of the game (especially if loosing only by a few points, or maybe especially if loosing by a lot!) to make sure that all players understood/applied the rules the same way. Also because the action is very frenetic, how to you prevent players from making game-changing mistakes? Finally I find that while really cool, the game won't offer very much replay value; it seems to me like most games will follow a very predictable path of upgrade-build-produce-ship.My final criticism relates to demand generation/production, but I believe that the advanced rules address that concern.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's cube management with timers.  A euro for that requires both efficiency on the board and in the fourth dimension.  Although the game has little interaction I enjoy the design because it's extremely unique feeling, plays in 30 minutes and brings a level of stress (having to manage two timers) that I can handle.  I'll never win this game because I'm a slow methodical thinker but I look foward to giving it my best shot again.  Must say, a bit disappointed by the soundtrack.  (UPDATE: bumped down a point after replaying.  I fear that this game will lose it's charm quickly)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The ultra innovative system deserves some credit. Many games have "what should I do? I only have two actions!" dilemmas. This one has lots of those interesting decisions packed in 30 minutes. The only two drawbacks: the timers, which are VERY different and some luck that can decide a game, specially in a 3 player game. But a great addition for any game library, literally a nice change of pace.

Tense and intense. Nice time limit and time pressure mechanism. No AP with this one (not if you want to win).

Takes a few games to really get the hang of as there is no time to stop and ask about rules questions etc. If you do others will ignore you. Also hard to look at other people's strategies when you are concentrating so hard on your own area and only after the game do you get a chance to figure out what others were up to.

RATING: 7
A colorful and attractive novelty game with several nice features, including the use of a thirty-minute soundtrack to govern the length of the game and sand timers to represent production time. There's a lot to think about and coordinate and the game zooms by.

Unfortunately, it probably has limited replayability. We once played two games in a row--the second time through everyone played much more efficiently but it wasn't nearly as exciting and fun as the first game. Still, it's worth a few more well-separated plays; I'm looking forward to trying it again with the expansion. [3 plays]

RATING: 8
An amazingly unique concept - sand timers are used to dictate when you complete an action in this real-time strategy game that's NOT played on a computer.  I've gotten the chance to play a bit more and I think that some of the things I perceived as problems at first are not.  I complained of the technology decks being too lucky, but now that I know the decks better, I don't think that's the case.  I still think there's too much potential for accidental cheating, but them's the breaks, I suppose.

Interesting game that is good for a play or two.  The game, in my opinion, suffers because everyone is in their own world because they are focused on their (wildly innacurate) sand timers.  This makes for a game where their there is NO player interaction and it would be easy for someone to make a mistake or cheat without anyone the wiser.

Tamsk with theme, kinda.  And a lot more confusion.  First of all, the game plays for half an hour.  It probably took us that long to set it up, sorting out all the cards that weren't included in a 3 player game.  The cards aren't coded for easy sorting, you just have to go through the list of about 8 different card types in varying quantities and remove them from the deck.  It may sound dumb, but it was a pain in the butt.  Gameplay was meh at best.  It may be better with more plays as you start getting accustomed to the cards, their rules, and how to use the sand timers.

Game mechanics like in no other game. Every action takes 1 minute to complete and game in total takes 30 minutes to complete. Perhaps not the deepest experience but very fun to play.

A very unique, hectic real-time experience. 

The cards are thin but the cardboard and wood components are nice and sturdy. Decent artwork and theme. The sand timers are not synchronized at all: You have to mark, measure, and pair them yourself in order to get balanced positions for all players.

I strongly prefer to play without the sabotage cards. They add too much to the already high luck of the draw issues, and they are too strong in use. It might be a good idea to ditch the neutral planets as well, since they reduce the need to go to other players' planets, and make trading a very unlikely option. [edit: The expansion [gameid=32342] addresses both of these issues]

The timed game seems to lead to mistakes in scoring and rushed decisions. Fortunately you can check the scores at the end. With timers also being of different length, the whole game seems unbalanced.

I enjoyed the novelty factor for sure. I liked playing my own little game, in my own little world, cranking cubes out and shifting them out before others could get there. Very intense and subsuming. The downside is that everyone must *fully* understand *all* the rules before you start because there isn't time, and it's not fair to them, to ask questions of the owner mid-game. This severely limited the opportunities to get it out. The other issue is that your opportunity to score points is largely dictated by what the players on your left and right do (what points opportunities they provide you), so your result feels a little out of your control.

The game starts out calm enough, but the tension quickly grows.  The last couple minutes slow down as there tend to be few objectives remaining and not enough time to attempt them, but this doesn't really detract from the game.

First time I played this game after owning the original for almost two years. The game is enjoyable and has a real different feel to it than other boardgames.

Tha sandclocks are wonderfull (even if they aren't clocked exactly ;-) )Will play this again. Haven't decided on the final vote. Rating may go down or up.

Based on one play: The ideal is great. You play a fixed amount of time and use sand timers to perform actions. Thus you play in real time trying to produce and deliver goods. The problem is that it is slow and you run out of things to do (in the base game). Maybe with the advanced rules 9which includes all the cards and options) it is more interesting, since the base game was kind of dull with very limited options.

Rules needed a better translator, but I think we worked it out. Love the idea of the time limit for the game, and actions all coming when a sand timer runs out.

Also would have been nice if the timers were all the same time, which the included ones were not. Looking forward to comparing the new Time 'n' Space, which updates this game.

One 3-player game. In many ways just parallel solitaire with sand timers, it has more strategy than the components suggested. Those components are quite nice but gave the impression of a toyish filler. Takes up quite a bit of space but everyone needs to be near the board and be able to clearly see the other player's areas. With the 'collision of hands' due to the reaching here and there in real time, the large cylinders would have been better as megacubes. Not into 'real time games' but a decent fast game overall.

It's got a completely new mechanic.  But I do worry about there being a dominant strategy (rush to tech 3, build lots of megacities, never waste your time on tech 1 - I've seen it win 2 games out of 2 so far); and it could get old quite quickly.

Even if you have miss-matched timers, it's not a problem so long as everyone gets a balanced set.  I timed all of mine with a stopwatch - 66.8 secs was the average (ignoring the two that were way off), so I marked up the timers with coloured dots so that each player gets a pair that take a total of 127 seconds to run out.

Not my type of game. In my view, real-time playing was an interesting concept that required one more element. There was no time to check and argue with other players about their actions, therefore opening the door to 'errors' and 'abuse'. The fact that it was not in my best interest to spend time arguing about the cost of certain movements took away much pleasure at trying to perform my own actions. I left the game feeling I had been cheated, most probably by a well-meaning mistake but, in any case, I felt I had undeservedly 'lost' that game...

Only played once 2007-09-11.  I don't generally like real-time games, and in a game with various fiddly rules, the real-time pressure makes it especially chaotic for first-time players.  It seemed OK for that sort of thing, and it was fun to try once to see what the hype was all about, but I feel no urge to play it again.

A practical problem is that the sand timers didn't all run for the same amount of time, which seems an inherent problem with any game that depends on multiple sand timers owned by players, like this or Tamsk.

Interesting as a novelty, and I like that the game comes with a CD for soundtrack and time keeping.  However, this one was a bit chaotic for me.  Luck in what your neighbors draw for mines can hurt opponents farther away.  I also feel this game nearly needs a moderator, not so much to keep cheating in check (which could run rampant) but to double check everyone's upgrades. I never knew that 30 second timers could vary so much...  and I was unlucky enough to get two of the slower ones.  Artwork is ok, but Im no fan of the Giger stuff and would have liked to see a little variation between color/players.  Rule book is also confusing.
I will play this one again if asked since its only a 30 minute game.

RATING: 7
A novel idea, but a bit too much time sitting around waiting for sandtimers early on, and there is quite a bit of luck in drawing cards.  However, having said that, the late game can be frantic, and the game can be very enjoyable.  I am a little worried about the strength of the black cubes - in my last game I could do nothing for the last 10 minutes, as after a strong start everyone targeted my timers with their black cubes for the remainder of the game.

The GOOD: incredibly innovative, good theme, great fun. 
The BAD: timers are way off, cheating an issue.
The UGLY: extremely random (when going through the development cards), unbalanced (you help your neighbors more than the persons across the middle), stupid weapons (delay two timers for the price of one).

Played this once and was very entertained.  We all agreed it got our hearts racing and kept us each looking all over the place all the time.  It's interesting not dealing with the "my turn, your turn" thing...if confusing.  I suppose some clarity will emerge from repeated plays with veterans and the inevitable emergence of a handful of house rules and/or interpretations.  All-in-all, a crafty twist on resource gathering and production.  I also enjoyed the evolution of the game board--your strategy could be yesterday's news by the time you're able to execute something--you could be blocked, or the board may have changed enough to make it a paltry option where some patience could have paid off handsomely if you'd only waited a bit.  The CD had us all chuckling as well...definitely worth playing and playing again--the "30 minute" time limit is great...it obviously will become a great filler in anyone's collection, and is easy and light, once a few core concepts (which are fairly unique) are grasped.

Real time space game, but with a very different mechanic than Space Alert. I like this one really well, but I think a lot of people are put off by the timer aspect. I find that I'm able to plan out my next moves during the downtime, and if I stagger my timers, I'm pretty much working the entire 30 minutes.

I like the concept; it reminded me of Galaxy Trucker, but there are some problems with game play. The rules are a bit confusing and with the real-time aspect this means getting a clarification during play costs you. Probably you should have a referee to monitor the players. I'd still be willing to play it some more.

RATING: 7
Hectic and different - well the sand timer bit anyway. I find I understand it much better with a pizza delivery theme. Worth trying out more than once because it's rewarding for something a little new (time pressure mechanic), mixed with a good old develop, produce and deliver game.

With further play the sand timer becomes a lot less hectic and you find you've got time to survey the cards other players have, see where their ships are heading, etc. Points depend on your neighbours coming to you, but travel doesn't take so long and the advanced rules help greatly with demand coming from the neutral planets. The game should only be judged by the advanced rules after first playing the basic rules to familiarise yourselves with what's what. Then for your third play you can ramp it up another notch with the All-Zeit expansion.

Setup time is a bit of a killer for more than four players, so I prefer just to own one set and play with exactly three - so each opponent is your neighbour.

Played at BGG.con '06. I've been describing it as a "fun activity" rather than a game, as I've only played the beginner rules. I imagine the advanced rules would add some game to it. I liked it, mostly for the novelty.

Edit: Still novel, I'm terrible at it. I'd like to play some more and get better!

The use of timers in this game is really interesting and worth the play.  However, it just doesn't seem to work quite the way it should.  Everything was agonizingly slow.  Though we were "racing" the clock, it seemed like all we did was wait.  That really is not fun in my book.  Overall, I would be happy to play again, but I'm not interested enough at this point to pick this one up for my own.

Has to be one of the most innovative games in years. This one also gets a double award for best implementation of a real time mechanic. Set in space: Player are space traders and are given 2 timers which are then used to activate a variety of activities. These includes building or upgrading technology, producing resources, moving spaceships etc. The object being to bring resources across the galaxy to satisfy trade demand in exchange for VPs.

There are very interesting elements along the way: trading, tech upgrades, sabotage cards all wrapped up in a flurry of hands and activity! What sheer fun! Another plus point is that the game finishes in exactly 30 minutes. The makers were also kind enough to provide a 30 minute long CD with ambient space noises! This is a hit for 2006 for me.

Economic. Initial rating after not playing it, but watching it played by my friends at BGG.con 2006. The sandtimer mechanic is interesting, cool and very fresh. However, suspect it would still be chaotic even with experienced players. I'm also concerned that the game might be stale or bland without the time limitation. I'd like to get an actual play in, but remove the sandtimers and just go around the table giving each player 2 actions per turn, for a total of 60 turns, to see if the game is any good or not without the time gimick...

RATING: 9
There is a lot of game packed into this 30 minute gem.  This probably isn't exceptionally deep, but it is downright fun.  It takes the idea of real time strategy computer games and shoves it into a board game.  There are a ton of little choices as you only have two timers.  There isn't a whole lot of interaction, but when you do have the opportunity to trade it usually is quite worthwhile and makes for some great decisions (do I wait here for them to arive waisting valuable time, or do I move on racing for something more valuable only to dump comodities that I can't use).

I'm sure that the sand timers aren't all even.  Tough luck if you get a slow one.  The game is only a half an hour, so I don't see that as a real problem when you aren't playing this competatively.

I have to say that this has the greatest sales gimmicks, if you buy two you can play up to eight. God, I'm a sucker.
This ranks as one of my favorite games of the year.

I acquired two copies of this for 8-player action.  Needless to say, it's not for everyone!  But if I'm feeling like 30 minutes of chaotic action, here you go! *Update* - Turns out 8 players might be even more chaotic than even I desire.  I'll keep the one copy as I enjoyed the 3-player game.  *Update* - Played it 4-player, and it was fantastic.  Really fun.  Bumped by rating up to 9 because I enjoy it so much and because it's so freaking wacky.

Hmmm. I don't know what to make of this game. It certainly was new and different. A RTS boardgame with an interesting time management mechanic. And I understand the buzz surrounding Space Dealer...but don't embrace it fully. Sure, I had fun, but it was utterly and completely chaotic and messy. By the end of the game, it looked like a bomb had gone off on the table. Cards and bits everywhere. I felt like it was hard to see other people's goals with all the movement going on and moving my pieces felt like Thanksgiving dinner at the Klumps with hands passing in front, underneath and over everyone else's. I will definitely give this another go but for right now it feels a bit overhyped. The soundtrack, a nice idea in theory, was bad. Where is the Kraftwerk commissioned piece? Maybe for the deluxe edition...

Initial impression of this was that it had some novel concepts, but not really interesting.  However, I've found it to be more fun the more I play it, and I recommend it.

1st play, prototype at Gathering '06: I didn't think I would enjoy it, but it was one of those light games that's just fun! It's timed: each player gets 2 timers (30-sec, I think) and everyone plays simultaneously for 30 minutes. You need to accomplish many tasks, for example: building buildings (factories, power plants, specials, etc.), using buildings (making goods, creating "blockers", etc.), sending your ship to other player's worlds to sell goods. You use a timer for all these tasks. Of course, with only 2 timers, you can't do what you need to do quickly enough ... after the initial few minutes, there is a clear time crunch and you feel it! Being a prototype, the components weren't great - foam cutouts and wooden bits; the final version, however, sounds like it will be very cool!

Right now, probably a 6; need to play the final version.

2nd play, BGG.CON '06: A real-time pick-up-deliver game using sand timers to accomplish every task (eg develop technology / build factories, power plants, and other machinery / move your goods-laden ship to other locations and make deliveries).

The timer is a great way to do the real-time-strategy thing. However, it would have been better to play the full game. The simple game is too simple, and I'd give it just a 6/10. The full game, from what I remember from 7 months ago, had more types of buildings and a bit more interaction.

Unique, innovative game where your actions are determined by sand timers.  The only other games it reminds me of in a way is Tamsk.  You really have to be alert and efficient and I was neither, so I got hammered in my first game.  I'm not convinced that it will hold up upon repeated playings, but we'll see.  A bonus point for the cd that serves as a reminder on time remaining as well as some cool background ambience.

I had high hopes, but I really didn't care too much for Space Dealer.  I like some of the ideas, but I just didn't have much fun.  Between timers that don't work, and tech level 2 being near meaningless, I was just unimpressed with the overall balance of the game.  One player managed to draw both the 2nd spaceship and the 3rd timer.  Another got the other timer.  It was basically between them, and it seemed like everyone stopped trading with the one who got the spaceship, so the other guy won.  I guess it is an "experience" game, and as such it might work.

I don't see that this game has a lot of depth.  It's a fun game to play once, but once you have the rules down there's not too much in it.  CAVEAT:  I haven't played the advanced game, which looks like it adds a LOT more strategy.  So I may be being unfair to rate it after two tries of the basic rules.

I think this may also just not be a game for ME.  I don't enjoy RTS games, and I think some of the same elements are in this game (watching anxiously as your timers run down while looking around to try and follow what everyone else is doing).  It just makes me feel nervous for 30 minutes.

One last negative:  I'm shocked at how different the timers seem to be.  I guess there's a fairly wide range of industrial error in making them, but it's definitely off-putting in a game where so much depends on the timers for them to be so variable.

The real time factor is very different and well done, though one must expect a lot of incidental problems during play (like knocking over timers).

RATING: 8
Played 3+ times.  Very Very neat and innovative.  Scales very well. The timers that come with the game are not well balanced but I've evened them the best I can.  It seems like a heavier game than the 30 minute playing time suggests, because you are VERY engaged.  There's definitely luck involved in the tech level card draws and you really are fighting with the person two seats away for the completion of the multiple goals in between you.  Probably takes a couple games to play well.  I'm not sure if I like all the advanced cards, because I'm not sure if their balanced.  Currently I play with (1) you can double build to get to the 4 power plant and (2) you can trade stuff in your planing area. I think I'm going to start playing with (3) the neutral planet demands because currently it feels like we're running out of things to do at around the 28 minute mark.  **UPDATE** lots of stuff going on and there's really no slow way to introduce people to all the rules.  Very hard to police peoples actions.  Lots of fun though. I have a like/dislike relationship with the neutral planet demands.  They sort of break the mold of I give you points you give me point mechanic and provide a way for people to try another path to victory.  I think it detracts from the goal of the game and can distract players.  Don't use in a first game. 2006/12/05

[Rating for basic game] The timers seems to slow down the action like in Tamsk. I know what I want to do, but I'm just waiting on this timer to do it. If you take away the timer gimmick and replaced this with a action point system, then you're left with a pretty shallow game of producing, shipping and scoring goods. Then added on top of it you have a research/build system that depends on good or bad luck. You need to take one of the buildings and can't take two and can't choose what you're going to build from all the building possible. So you get stuck with things you don't want, have to pass up something good when you get two good things or keep going through the pile trying to find the building you need. (Oops, don't have any yellow to start with, but I didn't get a yellow mine out of the pile and have to take a second red mine or blue mine because those are the two I drew. Now I have to draw two more cards and hope one of these is a yellow mine) So some of this could be helped if people could choose what they wanted to build next and had their own build decks. They filled the box with extra wooden bits you can't use at the same time so it makes you wonder why each player can't have private build deck. 

Also, what benefit do you get from the game by making the player across from you a longer delivery than other players. So if he has stuff to deliver to, I'll be beaten out by my two neighbors if we give the same effort in the delivery. Why not just have everyone fight over standard deliveries in the center of the table that takes everyone the same time to get to. (This isn't a problem in a 3 player game I think, but I never played it)

This is a tough game for me to rate, since I am a little conflicted.  It is a unique, quick-playing, fun game with lots of decisions to be made.  So what's not to like?  Time pressure!  The reason I don't like computer games like Starcraft and the like is I just don't like time pressure.  For the most part, it's the turn-based nature that brought me to board games in the first place.  Still, it is cool.

My low rating for this is not so much based on the problem with the different time period it takes for each timer to run through, but rather that this game is pretty much everything I dislike in games. And what good is the admittedly innovative system for, if the game is that hectic, and not clearly arranged? You can't possibly have an overview of all that's happening. It's easy to get confused and waste your turns. I never was a big fan of real-time strategy. It always reminds me of Starcraft. While I certainly liked that particular PC game, I hated the routine some people developed. If you'd watch them "play", you saw a machine doin the perfect clicks. Same here. This title rather feels like an exercise in automatization than a game.

RATING: 8
A terribly fun game.  I got to play it at BGG.con a couple of times, and it was a 30-minute blast.  One problem was that the rules are unclear in a number of places, and so different groups played it different ways.  (In one game, I couldn't figure out why everyone was SOOOO far ahead of me, and after the time went "ding," we figure out that the other 3 players had misinterpreted 1 rule and I had misinterpreted another meaning my production was about 1/4 of theirs.)  Takes along time to set up, and a while to explain the concepts, but it seemed worth it.  Might be some replayability limits given its novelty, but it is also possible that once you've got the system down pat, you'd be spending more time watching and anticipating the other players -- a few seconds makes the difference.

Don't score until the end.  Don't let people bogart the best cards.  In fact, add more f'n cards to the advanced game and don't ever play the basic game.  Double-check the timers, our copy had two timers that were almost 30 seconds off.

Yeah, the sand timers are a gimmick.  But they are cool and the real-time nature of the game is pretty unique.  Beneath that mechanic is a solid building/resource (time) management/delivery game, too.  Not the deepest game, but it feels right given the time constraints. Biggest plus:  plays in exactly 1/2 hour.  Biggest negative:  requires huge amounts of table space.

Had the sand timers been all the same time things would have been different for this game. Not a whole heck of a lot but still some. I mean balanced timing mechanisms when all players are basing their games around the sand timers is crucial. It just sucks when a game comes down to "Get the right sand timers and you win." Why not just sit around and cut a deck of cards all night?

This just wasn't my type of game.  It wasn't a bad design or anything, but it was really frantic.  This may have had something to do with the fact that I played in a 7-player game on my first time, but regardless I have the feeling that the time pressure of this one just isn't what I'm looking for in a game.  I'm glad I go to try it once, but am unlikely to play it again.  It is a neat idea though to have a real-time game like this, and am interested to see what other games employ the same basic mechanic in the future.

Finally got a chance to play this one after seeing it at BGG.Con '06.  It takes a little getting used to, but the chaos factor is a big plus with me.  We still had some rules questions and as it turns out I was taught the wrong rules for going to the other planets, but I'd definitely play this again.

I have some problems trying to deal with the difference between the timers but overall is a fantastic game. I am anxious to see extensions.

A game fun enough for me that I can rank it higher than the actual gameplay may merit. The basic ideas of the game are just SO cool. The theme, the music, the timers, the bits. I love all the things about this game. I love the tech track, I love the way you score. 

The frustrating part is the cards. Too often people have to waste time searching for a power plant. There are too many of the "black cube" cards in section 2, and it seems not enough production...I am always a color or two off. That is ok for a while, but when you take steps to fix it and randomness gets in the way, it is frustrating. Just frustrating enough to make me wonder how long I will play the game in the future.

Quality control problems on the timers are a shame So let's say minus 0.5 points for that. Plus, my set arrived with no red resource cubes! But decent execution of a very strong and distinctive concept otherwise.

1 play.  The game was ok, but nothing I overly enjoyed.  Setup almost took as long as the game, and some of the timers were much faster than the others.  Seemed gimmicky, and I don't think I'll have much desire to give it another try.

After 3 plays: This game has everything that I like: fun theme, short play time, little downtime, cool bits, and a climatic ending.  I liked it so much that I put in an order for it 2 days after my initial play.

RATING: 7
Very good game.  Only reason I don't give it an 8 is that in a 4 player game how you do is too dependent on who you're sitting next to.  This game has some unique mechanisms.  The board is sectional so it goes together in different size circles depending on how many players there are.  The ships are neat pieces in the vein of the Diamant carts.  The timers unfortunately are generally low quality sand timers which is really a shame given how crucial they are to the game.  Of course if the variability drives you nuts, then you can always buy higher quality timers.  The game lasts precisely 30 minutes.  Game play is simultaneous.  Every action is delayed by a sand timer.  When the sand timer is up, you take your action, choose your next action and reset the timer.  The goal is to manufacture goods and sell them to other players based on the demand they create by playing cards.  It's a little slow to start but it picks up nicely and makes for a very interesting play.

Someone always asks if playing two timers on a card makes it go faster.  If the designers found a way to do that, I'd give this an 11.

RATING: 6
Great fun, and really unique.  I have to admit that I bought the new printing and still have two timers that vary pretty widely from the rest and one other one that has a piece of miscellany in it that will occasionally clog it, which is somewhat annoying.  That aside, I have a lot of fun while playing it.  There's a lot of decisions, and the timing issue means that you're never going to be bored.  There's always more information out there than you can process.  I'm convinced that there's a significant advantage to having a faster timer, and I have my suspicions that the strategy is somewhat degenerate, but it's fast enough that I don't really mind.  Not the type of game that you're going to sink your teeth into, but the kind of game that's fun every now and then, particularly when you introduce it to new players.

I give this one high marks for the most innovative mechanism to come out of Essen 2006.  The timers are a bit off by a few seconds so you need to time them (both directions) and match them up for average times which isn't a big deal. The game only runs 30 minutes and the CD isn't required though the music is kind of nice.  You're really playing a 4-player solo game with not too much interaction. You'll be too involved in trying to decide the best actions to take.  Overall a solid game that I give above average marks to.

RATING: N/A
Interesting....30 minutes!  Sounds like an ultra-quick building/filler game :)  Not sure about the sand timer mechanic,  so will want to play once.  Could probably play this as a turn-based game,  if we assume everyone starts their timer on the one minute mark...but then you'll have to resolve ties :P

Sounds a bit like a one-trick pony...

I enjoyed the game, but I think I might be enjoying the gimmick more than the game.  We'll see with a few more plays.  I think that there might not really be a lot going on in this game.  Also, I think I don't like the black cubes - they seem like a little bit of an afterthought.

Played with expansion - the black cubes are better now.

I still like it - it is a gimmick, but I'll happily play this one a few times a year.

I applaud Space Dealer's off-the-wall use of timers, but movement is too limited and the game puts its eggs into the same tired resources-for-points Easter basket.

Play it once, admire it for what it is, and then be glad that someone else bought it.

I am not sure yet. The timers are interesting and work but are fiddly to handle. If you like real time, you should enjoy this one.

Played once (with 3 players). A game based on an innovative idea, but which doesn't seem to work as well as it could have, for some reason. Also appreciable is the fact that the game length is known in advance. I wonder how much replay value there is in the long run, once players get used to it and know how to optimize their uses of the timers - still for now I would be glad to play it again, probably a few more times.

In the beginning I only played it as 2 player game (I devised a home rules for it). My wife really enjoys it. As for me I really liked it the first 3 times but now I find it a little bit repetitive and I am not looking forward to the next plays so much.  

I got a chance to play it with 4. I definitely like it more. I really recommend playing this game at least once (preferably twice of three times) - it's an experience like no other.  Unfortunately it gets a bit repetitive after this and I do not expect to play it more then once or twice per year. Still you own it to yourself to try this unusual game out.

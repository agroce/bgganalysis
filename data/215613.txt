I played it on a pre release exhibition from my friend Pedro Latro (designer of this game). I am pretty satisfied with the outcome, very good gameplay with interesting mechanics and theme. The art is great and puts you into the theme. Backed a copy for myself.

Dragons, eh?  I've seen the movies, they're extraordinary aerial acrobats and dead-eyed, fire-breathing killers.  Apparantly, the movies got it wrong.  In Tao Long we are dueling dragons shuffling pieces around a rondel mancala-style to determine our next move.  What this can lead to is a kind of inept and tiresome dance in which neither dragon is able to draw a bead on the other.  Playing with portals can make this better or worse.  Playing with impassable rocks in the middle of the board definitely increases the frustration.  A shame really as the game looks beautiful.

Once we moved on from the grasshopper play mode and started using the flux coin, the game became much better. The variable game board using different pieces adds a lot of replayability. Very nice theme and visual design, backing up an already solid 2p strategy game.

I am undecided how I feel about this game. The mancala gameplay is cool but hard to get used to. I didn't feel like I had a lot of control, but that is probably because it was my first playthrough and in solo mode. I'm kind of feeling like this game should never have had a solo mode. I will hold off on rating this game until I get a chance to play against a human opponent.

Backed it on Kickstarter, this is the very first board game I backed on a crowdfunding. The art is great. I met Dox Lucchin the artist in Spiel Essen 2017. It's sad that the game is not yet delivered. Tao Long is a very short strategy abstract game. This game offers something so basic but it does not mean that Tao Long is boring. The game mechanic is not something revolutionary but it does feel refreshing. Both of the dragons need to win and one would win if he is carefully moving and drafting his strategy carefully. I personally like Tao Long a lot.

I've played this 5 times, Once with my wife, my daughter, my friend bryson, my uncle Dave, and my daughter again as the fluffy pink bunny. I enjoyed each game, even though I lost 3/5 games (yes I lost to a 5 year old with the fluffy bunny). We haven't done the advanced rules where the direction of the ba gua changes depending on the color of the stones. But the game is fun, unique, and strategic. 

Against my friend Bryson the game took a long time because he and I both enjoy playing chess and we were each thinking several moves ahead and trying to prevent our opponent from doing certain actions on the ba gua. 

My friend Gabe kept me stuck in a position where I couldn't move for three turns causing me to lose health, and I had to ensure that he was forced to move by moving the stones on the ba gua to leave him no choice but to leave me alone. So the game can be very strategic.

The game reminds me of the classic video game snake, but there's a dueling aspect and there's also fire breathing and portals and I really enjoy it. I like that all my friends picked up the basics of it very quick and could use the pictures on the board to learn to play very quickly. Checkers and other classics are also quick to learn but have strategy to them that takes time to master. I think this game will be a classic in that respect. 

I bought the deluxe which has wooden tiles and a neoprene mat. The quality is very fine. I have no regrets with this purchase.

Hmmm. The first game of this left us cold. Driving your dragon around the board is not that interesting as the board is simultaneously too small and too big at the same time (I think the mountain in the middle is the problem). I also won with basically one giant attack and a few nibbles.

RATING: 7.5
The experience of playing this game and gradually understanding the rippling after-effects of each action is absolutely delightful. There's also a ton of variety in the ways you can play it that feels more intentional and more interesting than most of what passes for "variants" these days. However, given the small play area, the relatively slow speed at which the dragons move, and the often limited number of actions available to you, it can sometimes feel like sound tactical decisions are not adequately rewarded or that some bad decisions are overly punished.

Got the Kickstarter Deluxe edition with the 4-Seasons and 4-player expansions. It also includes the Fluffy Bunny and the Tiger&Phoenix expansions. So far I enjoy it a lot (only played and won 4 games at the time of writing). It looks really good, and I'm glad I went for the Deluxe edition with the wooden pieces. At the time of writing I have yet to try the expansions, other difficulties (only did Grasshopper, the starter difficulty) and single player. It's a nice change from all the strategy and worker placements we often play. I like the theme, and how every move you make influences future movements for both players, so it requires some planning ahead (which I sometimes forget)!

To start with, the components in the deluxe version of this game are amazing. Placing the wooden pieces on the game mat and moving them around is fun all by itself. Furthermore, I have now played this game at least a dozen times, and every time I find something new and reveal more of the beauty of the design. The use of the shared Ba-Gau (mancala type system) to determine movements creates a level of strategy in balancing working towards what I want and limiting my opponent’s choices. With the additional levels of play (Monk and Master), the skill needed in using the Ba-Gau to influence play increases as the players become familiar with the game. The multiple setups for the board of human (rocks, portals, village, etc.) totally change the strategy and how to best play the game. When you add in the expansions (4 Seasons, Fluffy Bunny, and The Tiger & The Phoenix), strategy is further adjusted. These aspects all together make an extremely enjoyable game with incredible amounts of re-playability.  This is quickly becoming one of my favorite games.

Just received my deluxe edition. Quality of all components are great and they are so beautiful. Game setup is easy. A lot of variant and scenario to try. Solo mode is ok, a bit too easy when I found how the AI dragon could be locked down with wisely Ba-Gua move and repeatedly attack it using water action. It's rather fun to play in 2-player mode.

TAO LONG ist ein thematisch in fernöstlicher Mythologie gekickstartetes, abstraktes Spiel für zwei Drachen, die sich zwischen Himmel und Erde mit Feuerspeiung und Wasserpspritzen bekämpfen bis einer kleingestückelt bis auf den Drachenschädel tot darniederliegt. Das Spielmaterial aus fettem Holz mit aufgedruckter, wunderschöner feingliedriger Kunst ist toll und leider das Beste, was das Spiel zu bieten hat. TAO LONG ist vietnamesisch und heisst auf Deutsch "Ich bin lang" und meint damit den aus vier quadratischen Spielsteinen zusammengesetzten Drachen, der sich hölzern, umständlich und oft verkantend über die quadratische Matte quält. Angetrieben durch einen Mancala-Rondell-Mechanismus, der die Züge des Vierkant-Drachen in die Horizontale und Vertikale anschiebt. Dabei ist es so, dass man recht schnell und häufig in einer katatonischen Bewegungs-Sackgasse landet aus der es kein Entrinnen und dafür auch noch Schaden gibt, bis sich die Aktionssteine auf dem Rondell wieder für eine eigene Bewegungsmöglichkeit gelockert haben. TAO LONG ist das Spiel, das sich zwei Spieler sucht um sich selbst zu spielen. TAO LONG braucht den Spieler, der zur Staffage bzw selbst zum Spielmaterial eines Spiels wird, das sich selbst spielen will. Und dies auch noch ständig blockiert und mit einer grausamen Ikonographie, die in ihrem kunstvollen Krikelkrakel offenbar gar nicht verstanden werden möchte. Der Spielevolksmund nennt sowas "gespielt werden". Ich fand es in seiner Absurdität sogar ganz unterhaltsam zu erleben, wie ich meinen Gegnerdrachen niederfeuerte und -wasserte, ohne zu wissen, wie ich das gemacht habe. TAO LONG ist nicht nur missglückt abstrakt, sondern bestätigt auch das Kickstarter-Klischee vom unausgegorenen Werk, das in materieller Schönheit nur ein leeres Versprechen und vollendete Hülle bleibt. Gegen TAO LONG fühlt sich das ebenfalls zwängige 2er Spiel HANAMIKOJI frei und luftig an wie ein Papierdrache, der von der chinesischen Mauer springt. Aus "Ich bin lang" wird "Ich bin raus" aus der Drachenwelt von TAO LONG mit einem zen-entspannten Lächeln auf den Drachenmaullippen.

Tao Long is a phenomenal 2-player game! It is like a new age take on Chess in many ways, and no single game ever feels the same, despite the simplicity of the board and tools. Each player takes on the form of a dragon, whether the one from heaven or from earth, and their mission is to destroy their opponent's dragon. 

As I said, the premise and game play are rather simple, but like Chess, there are so many possible moves and so many directions to come from, a "checkmate" in Tao Long may surprise you at times. 

Tao Long is truly one of the best games I have ever played. It was easy to learn, wildly engaging, and a thrill to play. I am a fan for life!

Beautiful looking game. Hoping to play it soon. :)

UPDATE 
First tentative rating after just one game. This looks like it has the potential to become a brainburner because while it is easy to determine what’s the best move, the opportunities opened to the other player and to oneself at least a couple of moves down the line is hard to predict without some significant mental gymnastics. 

Is it fun? I’m not sure at this point. The barebones game is pretty dry so it is worth to play with the advanced game.

Deserves way better rating than it has. Worth noting that the first game in "Grasshopper" mode on a plain map without obstacles or portal is teaching you the basics, while you struggle to accomplish what you want. Our first game ended with the other player trapping herself flying against the edge of the board until dead.

The games with the higher modes (Monk, Master, Chosen One) and the more exciting maps are a blast for several reasons.

1) Due to portals you can move very quickly and blind-side your opponent
2) You understand how to setup future moves while denying your opponent the moves that they need (or get trapped by someone and watch their smug face as you agonize over how to fix this mess) - once you "get" it the game really gets addictive
3) The feeling of two dragons in aerial combat is really well captured as you turn and snake around each other, trying to get a bite or fiery breath in

Highly recommended for 2p, haven't played 4p yet.

The game itself has gorgeous materials and various game modes, it needs dedication to be  appreciated. I was not willing to invest more time after one game. The choices were predictable and overall the game progression was boring as hell.

Deluxe version kick-started. I love abstracts but many of them are just variants of the old classics. Tao Long, however, is different from everything I've seen. Use a mancala to move and attack while also denying your opponent the chance to retaliate. The fact that lost lives remove dragon segments serve as a catch-up mechanism, as they get harder to hit. The dragons' circling around each is aesthetically pleasing and Tao Long really feels like an ancient game excavated from an old monastery.

The mancala mechanic heavily limits your choices in unpredictable ways -- you can even be limited to only one movement option on your second turn, if you open poorly. It's easy to arrange the stones to block your opponent's moves, but hard to plan more than one move ahead, so the game just feels punishing and claustrophobic.

Wow, this is lipstick on a pig.

Such a slow tedious game. Movement is frustrating, there's heaps of just turning and moving and no feeling of action. It would be more thematic if it was called slug wars.

Mixed feeling for this one. The components of the Kickstarter version I got are awesome, but the game play was confusing to my sister and I.

An abstract that uses a shared mancala mechanism to move pieces on a different board.  Two or four players pit dragons against one another in a battle for supremacy.

Sounded interesting on Kickstarter, comes with optional german rules and looked good. The components are gorgeous in the deluxe edition and the game is a neat brain twister. Especially the solo variant is a puzzle solving exercise, though, as no random variation is in the game - it all comes from the players actions. Solo play could kinda be solved, but you can just come up with layout variants and change up solo play that way. For me the right thing, as I love puzzke solving and this delivers in a beautiful package.

The KS Deluxe edition seems to have a lot of value. It combines the feel of a modern board game with the looks of a more traditional one - and does it well. Can't wait for my copy of the game!

O Tao Long é um jogo que realmente parece ter sido feito para me irritar, inserindo nele várias escolhas de design entre as quais mais detesto:

- Abstrato por natureza;
- Jogo competitivo para 2 pessoas (há variantes para mais, porém a forma básica é em 2);
- Travado - diversas vezes não há realmente opção de escolha, simplesmente faz-se o que é possível;
- Exige habilidade para posicionamento espacial, sendo que em meu cérebro isto é um grande buraco negro, triste e solitário.

O Tao Long acaba sendo um anátema para minhas preferências de jogo, trazendo quase tudo que detesto. O nome dele poderia ser, como apontou um amigo, "Tiago F- você".

É raro eu ter reações de tanto desgosto a um jogo, mas o estilo lembrou-me, com boa dose de terror, ao Tash-Kalar, sobre o qual eu não falo por medo que ele me ache e venha me matar durante a noite.

O Tao Long em si não é um jogo mal feito, ele apenas vai diametralmente contra muito do que eu procuro e prefiro nos tabuleiros. Ademais, a produção é soberba, com peças de qualidade sensacional e arte indefectível.

Porém, no fim, vou evitá-lo como à praga e correr como se o diabo estivesse me perseguindo quando vê-lo numa mesa. Ou seja, reações bem amenas e ponderadas.

Really well-done and elegant abstract, even in the most basic scenarios. There's such great balance, symmetry, and emergent patterns that make this strongly replayable! Great production values too.

Gorgeous pieces and interesting movement mechanics with good strategic play.  Games scales smartly from novice to expert.

I've played just one time and I loved it!! The game is so gorgeous, it is very easy to understand the mechanics and the rules, but is complex to make strategies, it is a great game!

After one proper play of the most basic game, in the most basic scenario (The Field), I really appreciated how suddenly the game can ramp up. At first, it seems like you'll nibble and scratch forever at each other, but two good blasts of water and/or fire can completely kill a dragon.

The Mancala-to-select-an-action mechanism has its usual fascination and flaws: You're forever counting forward and backward to see what you can do, but managing this Mancala engine in the "Ba Gua" bears much strategy in itself. Fortunately, due to the clever organization of the Ba Gua, with all of the moves that prefer or need to be performed from a horizontal facing on the Earth side, and all of the moves that prefer or need to be performed from a vertical facing on the Heaven side, this process quickly gets faster, because you don't need to study every option each time.

I think I am going to enjoy this more as my opponents and I level up to use the cooler rules and components. …but you definitely should start with the basic stuff, because it's a little surprising how mind-bending it can be to have a dogfight (OK, dragonfight) via veritably indirect controls… indirect controls that influence the actions available to your opponent!

Initially I thought this would be the best release of 2005. I do think it plays well, it has some tough decisions and there are several paths to victory. However, it's perhaps just a little too dry - more of an indication of where my tastes are leaning these days rather than a slight on the game itself.

Area control that involves influencing (getting majorities) people in order to receive the rewards they offer.

Ganeplay is through the use of cards, which introduces an element of luck, but this is mitigated by having an extra card to play each round.  Dual use of the cards (play influence or re-stock) is a nice touch, as is the multiple ways to score (completed missions, victory chips), and the use of money.

There are only 4 rounds, therefore playtime is reasonably quick, it plays very well with 2-4 players (I was surprised that the 2-player with the dummy player works so well), it has minimal luck, and its a cheap purchase.  Overall, despite the thin theme, the game works and is more than the sum of its parts, and I would recommend it, and note that it is one of the most requested games by my wife and my more casual gaming friends, despite the fact that it's not a casual game.

Note: make sure to laminate and/or get card protectors for the cards, as they are very cheaply made.

Cunning area-control mechanic enhanced by the wonderful Alea production values. Necessitating rather too much shuffling of wooden cubes and cardboard chits to be as satisfying and elegant as I'd like, but deserving of a high rating none the less.

RATING: 7.5
Interesting worker placement in which going last in turn order is a huge advantage. On your turn you play a card from your hand and can place 1-3 workers on that tile. Then you may move workers to an adjacent tile (as long as you leave one on the starting tile) and if you want you may move the workers again to an adjacent tile (as long as you leave a worker behind). Play continues like this until everyone has played all but one of their cards. If you had the most workers on a tile, you are awarded the token from the tile [you need these tokens to activate and score your mission cards]. If you did not have the most people, you have the option sometimes to pay for the token.

My first play was a 2 player game and it moved fairly quickly, but I could imagine the game taking much longer the more people are playing.

Louis is a good, but not great game. I have fun when playing, and make good improvements each time I play. The randomness due to the many cards is a little annoying. However I think I can ignore that easily enough and just have fun playing the game. There are enough decisions in the game to provoke good thought, and the strategic depth does shine through the randomness of the cards. UPDATE: sold!

There are quite a lot of rules, subrules and sub-subrules for tiebreaker compared to what Louis XIV is, a middleweight, tactical eurogame. Long setup, extremely procedural and unintuitive gameplay and the ice on the cake is the endgame scoring for the majority of each type of coat of arms which injects an absolutely unnecessary luck element into the game. I did not feel for a moment that this mess was taken place in the court of Loius XIV, except for the baroque-ish rulebook (worst from alea). 

And the strangest thing, that contrary to all of these concerns I rather enjoy the game with 2p. However, because of the rules (and how they are written) I will hardly introduce the game for my casual gamer friends. Mostly tactical game, although it can reward some strategic planning.

A good and enjoyable game, which is quite simple to play after you know the rules. However the game makes this a punishing experience. The iconography and labels are inconsistent and mostly meaningless (you are *constantly* referring to manual for clarifications), the theme could be better, the way features are scored is counter-intuitive, it's difficult for new players to understand the difference between different supplies (general/personal), the objective and player achievement is not obvious, and many of the mission cards are misleadingly worded.Apart from that though, a very good game!
Keeps dropping points after more plays...

RATING: 7
+ Amazingly simple, yet with tons of decisions to be made; I actually like the art/theme.
- Can be a bit dry of an experience for some.


Why it's previously-owned:
It's just a little bit too long for a filler or gateway game, and that's what it always felt like to me.  Additionally, I really disliked the random acquiring of the house tiles for victory points.  
This was traded for Goa.

RATING: 7
A really fun game.  There's a sharp balance between strategy (how & which cards to play, intrigue cards) and randomness (card draw, shields) at work.  A fair amount of player interaction during the influence phase as players compete for the various spots.  The theme is well integrated with the game play and works nicely.  I would gladly play this one again.  Rating may improve with additional plays.

I got the sense that the random aspects could overwhelm the strategic ones, particularly when it comes down to the wire.  From one play, it's difficult to get a good feel for this balance.

Seems like a good game -- we've only played once, so far, though.  It's fiddly & (over)-complicated, and Mrs. alexd isn't that keen on the theme (though we agree the art is nice).  We'll see, but it is by Dorn, and lacks Arkadia's "too high branching factor" problems.

REVISED:  Still complicated, though the rules aren't that complex.  But it's dull and irritating.  Too bad.

Worker majority placement game.

No boards, just 12 shifting cards to place tokens upon to get resources to complete missions and earn VPs. Other options to earn VPs seem like taking left overs and give them points for the sake of having multiple ways to VP collection.

Lucky it's only 4 rounds, and it proves that the system though simple, have no logic in them. Theme is completely paste on.

Lacking.....good start.....ends badly.

Although this game has a nice theme and great components, and plays through adequately, the game itself I find to be unenjoyable. I'm really interested to discover why many people have rated it so highly. 

I have had 3 plays now and have'nt discovered why I might want to play again. The rules are a bit confusing to understand in the English version, but are comprehensive; you just need to go through them carefully to understand the game mechanics because the game is not intutive in play. 

I played through this game once solitare( 2 player) to learn the game. On the surface the strategic choice in the game appears wide and complex, but my solitare expierience showed me how many game choices were severely limited by the influence cards in your hand. So the overall effect seemed to be a fairly random game. 

The greatest problem with the game is that the cause/effect game play processes are confused by there being too many variables, game stages, pieces (many bits & no board!) and proceedures to move/allocate which make the game hang together in a very roundabout way (but its kind of fun anyway). 

It will be interesting to see if many are interested in playing this game repeatedly.....(I might have missed something)

RATING: 7
Louis manages to pack quite a lot of elements into a pretty small package; there's resource management (influence pieces and money), time management (getting those crucial end of round placements by picking up influence cards, intrigue cards, and through certain personalities)and a strategic decision about how much attention to pay to the shields.  In addition to managing those resources, there's a need to pick your fights carefully.  I've played with both three and four; with three it seems to lack something.

Another area control eurogame. Plays in less than an hour. It has some minor card management aspect that offers some choices to the players. There is a small amount of luck but it doesn't bother me. All in all Louis XIV is an OK game but nothing spectacular.

Area majority game-- good basic structure, but I don't like some of the untidiness around the edges, e.g. Missions are less useful as game goes on; The rule about bonus points for the (random) selection of coats of arms seems unnecessarily random; very arbitrary and disconnected theme.

Bit of a Dorn disappointment to me. Too much randomness for my taste. Especially not fond of the shield method of acquisition.

{2 plays, 4 player} It's really just a bunch of old systems from other games, but mixed in a nice enough way and given enough of a twist to seem somewhat new and fresh.  So it was interesting, but... far too long and fiddley for what it is.  It seemed fiddley when it was taught to me, and then I tried to teach the next game, and, man, there are too many little rules here.  Not that you can't get them or anything, but way too many rules for such a simple *looking* game.  Still, enjoyable for a few plays, but I'd be surprised if this one hung around.

After more play... [original rating: 7]

Well, dang, if my opinion hasn't gone up a little after, believe it or not, a 3-player game.  I was worried there'd be less conflict, but not only was there plenty of conflict, you could actually target other players better (you no longer had to hit the 4th place player because it was the best move for the cards you had).  Those Alea people know something.

Gets it right. Nice number of things going on. Just enough thought required without inducing brain-freeze.

My favorite area-majority game.

The game board is really interesting with each spot offering a unique but valuable bonus.  But you are dealt cards that limit where you can play.  Each card lets you play on the space it represents as well as neighboring spaces.

And, of course, the trick is to win majorities with little competition.  You want to avoid getting stuck piling your resources into one space in competition with another player.

The unique bonuses of each space, coupled with the limited -- but still numerous -- options presented by your cards, weighed against were your opponents are playing make for some really great decisions.

We've had fun with this with less than the ideal number of 4 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
given what little this adds to the majority space, i'm kinda surprised at the high ratings.  there are some interesting mechanics in play, but the action is on the high end of the fiddly scale for a euro.  it did blow by in a pleasant amount of time, much less than the cited 75-100m although i wasn't timing it.  at 4 rounds, perhaps too short due to effectively random screwage.  but since player powers are developed throughout the game, i think it's unlikely that people will mount a big comeback if they're behind on 2  cards.  i was also surprised at how little the dreaded and discussed random shield thing ended up affecting the game.  i could see it in very close games, but are they usually?  also, for a game that is thematically void i think that something more fun or exciting than this could have been chosen.

I like to refer to Christmas 2007 as "The Year of the Board Game."  I received 5 games and purchased 6 more with Christmas money.  One of my favorites so far is Louis XIV.  I can see that there is so much more to explore after the initial games.  I like games where there are many decisions to be made, how best to maximize my resources, and how I can hose my opponents to boot.  The "intrigue" cards give just enough twist to the game without turning it on its ear, that I can't wait to play again.  Only played two player so far, but can imagine 4 player to be truly gripping.  May update after more plays.  [Gift]

On first reading of the rules i thought the game would be a bit dissappointing. I was wrong. Excellent area influence game with player power increasing with every round that gets better with every play. I read a lot of criticism about the randomness of the coat of arms, personally i dont think its a problem and has never detracted from play or enjoyment of the game. House rules can easily be applied if this bothers you.

UPDATE: still enjoy playing this game a lot.

I felt the game mechanics and concept were a bit far fetched in this game. The gameplay in itself was pretty fun but there were strange elements like why the game should end after 4 rounds aswell as the conditions and benefits of some cards.

Would have to play it again to better tell which rating this game should get. Right now it does not get past 7

Played 4 times at the GOF 2005. Game is terrific with multiple options and that lovely "just one more action needed" feeling. Each round you have to decide whether to go for the best items, where there will be much competition, or to concentrate on, and likely win, more smaller items. Your mission cards and powers help decide that. Still learning, but this is a great game.

First Play: Somehow tricky to understand half way through the rules being explained and then it all becomes clear. What a fantastic little game. A need to be flexible and work out what they opposition is doing and maybe a bad hand of cards can make certain goals hard to achieve but a little gem. 

SEcond play. Yes this is an absolute gem. Flexible plans are an absolute must with lots of oportunity for screwage if you look for it.

I NEED a board for this.

A board game without board. Players in 4 turns try to score victory points realizing missions. These can be accomplished winning over 12 personage from Louis XIV court, who provide each one a different advantage. Accomplished missions provide also a bonus or a special ability of some sort.
The game is much more complex than this brief description.
The interaction between character bonus, mission bonus and players strategy should guarantee to this title a long life.
As usual in this kind of influence game, efficiency is the key.
There is a random element stronger than in Goa but much less important than players decisions. Player interaction is quite high, and there is also much confrontation. A fun meaty game

This game can be rather difficult to understand from just reading the rules. Even after a good explanation players usually sit around with blank stares on their faces. This is mostly due to the very abstract nature of the game. The theme does not really connect with the gameplay. However the gameplay is really superb. Lot's of intracacies and the need to spend your influence wisely can make this into a brain burner. But the random card distribution adds the need for more tactical play and saves the game from a.p. hell. The end game scoring is a bit too random for me and I would like some variant where you have more influence on which coat of arms you get. Overall a challenging euro that plays pretty fluent once you get the hang of it.

Four plays.

I like how there are (for me) just enough options each turn - not enough to overwhelm, but enough to be interesting. The game looks beautiful, has a unique feel to it, and yes - is quite random when you start flipping those crests over at the end. But you know it's coming, so you can do your best to account for it...and if I lose a squeaker by chance, I'm OK with that, because I had a great ride.

This is a pretty solid, though somewhat chaotic game.  I like the influence mechanism, and the different strategies required to win over the various characters, but it feels just a little dated compared to other games.  I want to play this a few more times to get a better feel for it.

One play with 3 other relatively experienced players.  I struggled a bit because I didn't know the game real well, but it was fun to play.  I like the El Grande feel but simpler and with less single player to single player conflict.  I finished up okay.

After 2 more plays, I liked this a bit more.  It's a good game.

My favorite Modular Board game.  Elegant in every respect.  I recommend that you use some of the file downloads offered on BGG for teaching this game.

Player Aid: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/fileinfo.php?fileid=15465

Outstanding player aid to assist with evaluating tiles. Confused about ties? Can't remember when pieces go to the general supply vs. the private supply? This is the player aid you need. I've never played a game without it. Absolutely speeds up the whole process. It's also very attractively designed. I mounted them on posterboard and plasticized them.

http://www.bggfiles.com/viewfile.php3?fileid=10106

Played it once, and really enjoyed it. It is a cross between an area majority game and a worker placement game, with a lot to think about and many paths to vitory. An involved eurogame, great for the hardcore gamers out there. Should play well with two as well.

RATING: 8.5
An interesting game and difficult to rate after the first play, there certainly seems to be depth here in a game that took less than two hours for 4 beginners. What surprised me was that the missions seemed to be the obvious way to win, but the two of us that took that path were beaten by the one who collected shields. Hmmm, several more plays required.

Uprated after several plays, there is lots of depth here and there are so many choices and a lot of balancing between immediate benefit and long term. Enjoying very much.

Awesome game. Works great with 2, 3, or 4. (In a three-player game, don't forget to the give the last starting player a free Intrigue card in the fourth round as a consolation prize for having to go first twice. It's easy to forget this rule, and its omission can ruin the game for that player.) It's mostly area control, but with the area control not being the final goal. There's lots to think about and lots of ways to win, and it definitely forces you to be flexible and change your strategy for each turn, based on the cards you have.

Finally learned this one.  What a nice, involved game.  A lot going on making sure you have pieces to use and pieces in supply to ensure you can bring them out when you win an area.  Cool twist on area control.  Played really well with two and once you get a game under your belt, it moves along quickly...almost too quickly.  I also see avenues of winning.  IN the second game, I went to make sure I got cards down as much as possible where my oppenent gathered up chips.  He won by one.  It doesn't bother me regarding the draw of the coat of arms.  If you gather more of those, you are slipping in other areas.  It was a calculated gamble for me to not worry about those and go for cards.  I LIKE this.

Seeing the theme of the game, I can't understand why there isn't a French version of this game. Beautiful and very original design and a lot of tension are garanteed with this game.The mission cards are maybe a little bit to easy to purchase but this is an advantage/disadvantage for every player.The scoring points are always surprisingly close at the end.I play this game a lot, it is becoming more and more the favorite game of most of my friends.Each time I play it with experienced players, the tension is increasing and scoring points closer and closer at the end.

RATING: 5
After a few plays I must amend my score, this game is just too translucently mechanical to hold my interest.

Rudiger Dorn and Alea score again with this title.  Louis XIV is another entry into the overflowing area majority genre.  However, Dorn adds a few twists that separate from the overwhelming alternatives.  Unfortunately, in doing so he adds a little more complexity than preferred.  I also find the scoring and supply round absorb too much time for phases offering virtually no decisions.   I do recommend one of the variants that replaces the shield majority scoring.  Otherwise the winner may seem a little arbitrary.

After one play. Beautifully produced game area influence that reminds me rather favorably of El Grande. Enjoyed the aspect of completing "missions" to score points and gain special game-related advantages. Some tough decisions have to be made and our game came down to the acquisition of a single Crown token. The only notable drawback is the pasted on theme and the flat ending such games can have at times-- but still quite good.

RATING: 7
An area influence game where the victor of each area typically gets some power or advantage, rather than points directly.  Thus, it's very interesting and non-obvious to decide which regions to battle over.  Can be frustrating when your cards prevent you from influencing certain regions, and a commanding early lead may be insurmountable.

RATING: 6
Long & complex.  Limited control.  Plenty of options during a turn, but nothing you do has much certainty.  So much hidden information (influence cards, intrigue cards & secret mission cards) that you just don't know enough about what your oppenents want... nor do you know what they are capable of doing.  The game can develop a boom and bust cycle if players insist on making the bulk of the courtiers flip in unison (i.e. causing most of the courtiers to have the same winning condition for a given round, then all having the opposite for the next round).  I wasn't pleased with the "hand management" portion of the game.  Getting dealt multiple wild cards can really hurt a player (house rules could fix this).  Also, you must play 4 of 5 cards each round and you don't carry cards over between rounds... so this is tactics-heavy (low strategy) game.  The shield scoring at the end adds randomness, but I think it is balanced by the high value of completed secret mission cards.  Multiple paths to victory is a good thing, and I won a game by collecting shields and finishing just an average number of secret missions.

** UPDATE: the game is mostly tactical, but I enjoy it (probably because of the secret mission cards).  You must play somewhat conservatively in order to be sure to collect the guaranteed items, but you must also take risks and try to win majorities because you cannot win by only working on the "safe" nobles.

Others say:  Not good with 3 players.  Two fight and the third gets what he wants.

RATING: 7
Another interesting game in the Alea series with a unique-enough mechanism to make it not feel like a reworked version of something else. The player interaction when fighting for influence is a notch above Princes of Florence in my book. I don't know yet if I like it as much as Goa, I'll have to play it a couple more times.

This title confirms that I dig Dorn's work.  While not as high on my list as, say, Traders or Goa, Louis XIV offers just the right amount of game for the time spent playing.  The courtly inner and outer circle is nicely modeled by the portrait tiles and layout, and there is a nice spin on the area influence mechanism here.  Not quite a favorite yet, I'm sure it will reward those who play more frequently.  I'm not particularly bothered with the endgame sheild scoring as some tend to be, but I can certainly understand their criticisms.  Most recently played on 11 Nov. '06 with Alex, Michael and Corey.

All said, its a minor complaint for a decently thought out game.

Louis XIV is a good example of what happens to what might be a decent little game when it's buried underneath layers of excessive complexity and fiddliness.

At its heart, it's a simple area-control game... players try to influence the members of the court, each of which has some sort fo unique game benefit. Unfortunately, the designer didn't stop there.

TIles are flipped, but only under certain conditions ("give me the rulebook"). Influence markers are divided, El Grande-style, into two seperate groups, though it is never made clear what the two groups are in terms of the theme, and once an action is calculated some influence markers go to the general supply and others to your own supply ("pass the rulebook"). Different tiles have different tiebreaking methods ("hand me the rulebook again"). And the final scoring method was just weird and complicated.

DOn't get me wrong... I enjoy complex games, but there needs to be some method to the madness. BUt Louis XIV struck me, i nthe words of gamethyme, as "complex for the sake of complexity."

Fun game of area control. Lots of tactical choices as players deploy their influence tokens to gain the advantages and thus favors (special abilities/actions) of the various characters. Careful attention and concentration is a must during the influence placement phase, as mistakes in placement of tokens can cost a player opportunities for favor and scoring. I think that 3 players is not as balanced as four, as tokens are easier to pick up and mission cards are more easily fulfilled, making it a race to see who scores the most with the tiebreakers. Have not played with two. 4 players seems to be the best. Rating is for the 4 player game.

I enjoy this little area-control game.  The bit of randomness at the end can be bothersome, but only comes into effect in a really close game, which just means if you want to win, you can never assume you've done enough.  Also, it always seems to end just as my "plan" gets going, which only makes me want to play again.

I like the way the boards flip, so that the requirements for each can change from turn to turn, and the need to make the most of placement with a mancala-like mechanic.  Several nice ideas combined in a unique way.

12/25/05 - 6+ plays so far. Really enjoying this game and it is great when my wife likes these games too. Bribing the individuals is usually a good move but you need to be careful that you have enough money to bribe them all so that you can get your influence markers back in your supply. Otherwise, you'll end up trying to win their influence - thereby losing your influence markers and making it difficult to compete in the next round. Wonderful tension exisits throughout the game.

As an eighteenth-century historian I love this theme but found the game kind of fiddly and unbalanced. It was often hard to remember when to flip the tiles, and there seemed to be too many rules and bits for such a small game. 

As for the gameplay, although the tokens are important in fulfilling your card goals, tiles that gave VP chips seemed much more crucial in ultimately determining the winner. Some of the special powers are also a bit overpowered: I had a card that allowed me to pay 1 to forfeit my turn (whoop-dee) while my husband was getting extra money and placing extra influence every round.

Interesting majority game.  There are several random factors to it: card draws for where to place, card draws for missions/powers (which are balanced somewhat, but not perfectly), and bonus points for having sets of shields at the end (which are drawn randomly).  I enjoy the game despite all this, but I can see where more analytical gamers might be put off.

Pretty area majority type game where you place your dudes in order to get you various rewards from the king's court.

There's a balance between satisfying your cards, which gain you points and special abilities, and gaining shields, which get you end of game points.  Both seem fairly important, as you're likely not going to win with a good dose of both!

It's also a tough decision deciding how many guys are worth committing to a specific reward, and when to decide when someone just plain wants it worse than you do, saving the guys for something else.

Overall, a neat little game that is fairly simple and plays rather quickly.

This game has a lot going on. Its like El Grande but with a "mission" aspect. The theme is great and it can be a real nail-biter. Not sure how much I like the shield tokens at the end of the game, but I guess they needed to put in a random aspect.

Having lived for a good number of years in Versailles and acquired an interest in Bourbon history, I was eager to try this one out. I'm a big fan of Im Schatten des Kaisers - a majorities game doing a great job portraying medieval politics and intrigue - and was hoping for a game bringing 17th/18th century court intrigue to the table.

However, it has to be said that the theme is only about as strong as say that of Saint Petersburg. Nice touches here and there, but the game could have easily been about 20th century intrigue in the Kremlin or the like. That said, the graphics - based on famous old masters paintings - is terrific and helps a great deal in creating the right atmosphere.

One playing clearly was not enough to explore this game's depth and viable strategies. I like what I see a good deal, but it hasn't blown me away as Im Schatten des Kaisers's greatness has.

One thing I did not like, was the coats of arms chips' bonus being entirely arbitrary. There is no control whatsoever regarding that aspect of the game. You're subject to the whims of Fortuna. Considering that the COA chips' bonus is merely one extra VP, that may not seem much, but the final scores in our four-player game were very close. 40-46 range. I wish there'd be some strategic depth to the Coats of Arms, which it is IMO sorely lacking. We're already discussing more strategic variant approaches.

Really, I think a golden opportunity to enhance the theme was also lost on the coats of arms count. It would have been great if those rewards would grant you duchies, posts in the civil service, court hierarchy and armed forces. That's after all what the French nobility craved for.

The game system is intriguing, but it appears to me that Rüdiger Dorn should have gone that extra mile to make it more strategic and much truer to its theme.

I see why it reminds some of Ys. Fortunately, it is much more to my liking - whereas Ys did nothing for me.

Decision making in the influence phase is vital.  The mission cards are somewhat balanced, but not enough to make the game from developing into a runaway leader sometimes.  The final scoring is a little luck element that I don't mind personally.  I made it an effort to grab coat of arms.  I grabbed more than my opponents, then I got awarded more for this than them.  It is possible that somebody can make majorities and make up 3-4 points at the end, but I don't consider this likely.  It just means you have to hold them in high esteem in the influence phase.  If you ignore them, you will most certainly be trounced, unless you can make up for it with a couple extra completed mission cards.

I found this game very frustrating.  I will play it again but I found that I wanted to change certain rules to give more balance to the victory points as well as streamline the actions so that it would work better.  This game would play VERY MUCH BETTER with a number of house rules.

I don't mind the shield scoring because I don't think it affects the game all that much.  The rules make a lot of sense as soon as you see them in action.  Lots of fun/tough decisions for a meaty game.  

--the more I play this game, the more I walk away mad and I don't know why.  Not one of my favorite qualities in games.  I can get frustrated with this one in an unfun way.

--Update.  The 3-player game doesn't make me mad.  I really like the 3-player game.

--Update again. Love the 2 player game.  Love it love it love it. I wish the normal games was 6 turns long.  You really get to reap the benefits of your mission cards.

Although I wouldn't say that Rudiger Dorn's games are my absolute favorites, I've been pleased with all of the games of his that I've played (no whammies yet!).  This game has interesting mechanics combining resource management and "bidding," if one wants to call it that.

The homemade Louis XIV boards that people have made are pretty spiffy, too.  I like how this game is somewhat underproduced (no actual game board).

There are important decisions to be made in this game.  A bad move could lead to doom, albiet not immediate disaster.  That's a good thing for a game of this length.  I like the different ways to victory which opens up strategies and lends to extended playability.  Despite the great artwork/pictures, it is a bit dry.  But if you take the time to learn the history, the game can seem more atmospheric.  There are reasons why certain characters give out specific rewards when influenced.  Its not as arbitrary as it seems.

Granted I've only played once...but in this case I think that was enough. 

I enjoyed the game quite a bit. It certainly felt as fulfilling as Goa or Jambo. Dorn has been really hitting some solid extra-base hits with his last few offerings. I thought the theme, the game play, the pacing....it all just works very well. Much like Goa, you are using various means to get an economy generating points. Trying to use your precious actions efficiently.

BUT THE SHIELDS! How can such a fun and tense game be decided by something so arbitrary as the face down shield tokens. In my one playing, myself and another player were tied for the lead and both had the same number of shields. I won because I got one bonus point...through dumb luck. 

I'm afraid the shield mechanic just spoils it for me. I suspect there is a decent variant or something else that can be done to mitigate this effect, but out of the box....I don't think I'll be needing to play it any more. Winning or losing on such a blatant luck-play just leaves a horrible taste in my mouth. I just don't understand.....why?!

alea is back on track. Dorn again takes bits of his older games, and then grafts them onto an interesting new system and successfully makes another gamer's game and further establishes himself as a top level designer. Louis incorporates both longer term planning (fufilling missions) amd tactical play (making your cards work). I like the piece placement scheme which borrows from Grande (must get pieces out of a central pool before you can place them) and Traders (The tower: pieces placed in Louis can ,,walk" to diagonal squares, leaving trails). The missions are also nifty in that the special powers they confer allow you to tailor your game. I do have to nitpick though, this simply does not play as well with 3 because the player order becomes even more important than usual and is unbalanced with one player getting to go last twice. The two and four player games both seem to work very well though, with 4 of course being the best, but this still scales down to 2 incredibly well for an area influence game, which rather surprised me. The game also has the virtue of playing pretty quickly once people are familiar with it, and having a large number of interesting decisions, but it also has a number of elements that are out of your control as well, possibly an uncomfortable number of them for fans of heavier games.

Louis has ultimately ended up losing points from me with repeat play though. The mission cards are the main variable factor in this game, and once one plays the game a handful of times, they also start to become retreads. The fact that they come into one's hand randomly is necessary to keep the system on track (players pursuing different chits, and not sure which ones beyond the current round / cards not balanced) but it also seems to lower the replay value since all one can do is play to one's hand as well as possible. This isn't the only game with that factor, but I think Louis suffers a bit for it. I also have grown to dislike the fiddle factor of the setup, which probably just means that the game is growing stale for me, because it didn't bother me much when I first sat down to it. I think the bottom line is that Louis is fresh for a number of plays, but that it just didn't have enough in the tank to keep me captivated beyond that number. Not bad at all, would play it, but doubt that I'll suggest it again.

I really like this one, I think it deserves more recognition than it gets.  I doesn't seem to be one that people ever suggest playing.  I've only played the two-player variant, but I can't imagine that it doesn't get better with more people.  It has many similarities to Notre Dame, which I also really like (in fact, I was surprised that it wasn't by the same designer).
I kind of wish that the game was a bit longer, since you hardly get a chance to exercise the power-ups that you accumulate during the game, but I might feel differently once I play with more players.

The atmosphere is which I like the most about this game, but it's a little bit too abstract.
I'll give it 6 points.

Update on the 24th of November, 2013.
After a couple of plays I must admit my greatest problem with this game is that it completely lacks excitement. I love Euros. Caylus and Tikal are my absolute favourites. I really wanted to like Louis XIV. I have always been a history enthusiast, especially French history attracts me. But this game lacks something. It just doesn't feel like intriguing in the court of the Sun King. Instead it feels like dry and pointless work. Apart from these, I still really like the artwok of the game, it's surprisingly spectacular.
For example Royal Palace is much better and that game really puts you into Versailles. I prefer it to Louis XIV.

Due to these, my rating is decreased to 4,5 points.

A big fat "so what" to this one.  Sure, it's a smart design (most German games are)and the game has a great influence concentration versus dispersal mechanic but it's also completely redundant- you've played this game about a thousand times before.  10 years ago this might have been groundbreaking but now it just feels tired despite a good system.  The game is just soulless, passionless, and isn't really any fun.  It's really a shame, because it's very rich strategically despite an almost random scoring system.  Overall, it's yet another German game worth playing once or twice and then forgetting.  What a shame.

This is a good game but so much to try to keep track of. It needs to be played by a savant, a strategy researcher or an intuitive player. My only hope is to get good intuition. After further plays I think this game needs to be played regularly (preferably by the same small group) to really get the hang of all of its convoluted chicanery.
I don't get to play it often enough to avoid feeling like I am just getting the strategy as the game is ending each time I play.

My first play was very frustrating in an un-fun way, but I'd like to play again a time or two before rating.  I suspect the game would have been more interesting and fun to me if I could better anticipate what other players could do.  Instead I felt like whatever good move I just made would be completely undone by the time it was my turn again.  Too many times the final play by someone made me say "well there goes my entire round out the window!"

Not coincidentally I feel exactly the same when playing El Grande.

I really like it, but:
1) The game should support random setup.
2) The extra tokens/vps for coincidental majorities in things is screwed up.

In the beginning I wasn't too thrilled about Louis XIV. It took me ages to finally place an order with Adam Spielt (now defunct, unfortunately), and the first sessions left me with a splitting headache from absorbing the rules. The game isn't that difficult when shown how to play, but learning from the rule book requires quite a lot of reading. However, I persevered despite being shown every corner of the board(s?) by my main gaming partner, and now, after many games, it has become a title I would not easily part with.

Louis XIV is a funky excercise in majority gaming where big kahunas of the Sun King's court (i.e., Louis XIV) are bribed, bought and sucked up to for various goodies which can be used to complete 'missions'—basically ways to gain even more influence and money. Subject-wise this link is a bit weak, but it works nonetheless. The cool thing is that once a kahuna has given out a reward, (s)he changes the conditions for receiving that reward in the next round. This gives the game an incredibly dynamic feel, as there are many ways in which the players can achieve their goal, while being curtailed by the others. Delicious stuff.

Randomness? Yes, there is randomness. First in the cards you play to decide where you place influence. However, I've noticed that you can 'work around' a seemingly ill draw by focusing your attention elsewhere instead of trying to stick to your guns. Bend is the operative verb here, not break. The second source deals with the coats of arms. But these aren't as random as you might think. Of the 40+ points I score nowadays, only 2 to 4 are there by pure chance. And it is not like you don't know there will be 6 bonus points handed out at the end, so you'd best work you ass off to make sure those bonus points will not cause a nasty surprise! Things can get close, but they would have been close anyway, especially given the proficiency of the players in my group. The fun is more in [i]how[/i] you got to where you are, not [i]where[/i] you are. That makes it less of an issue for me, too.

Although I appreciate Louis XIV's design much more than in the beginning, grown to like and perhaps even love it too, I still slightly prefer the clean sober play of Mykerinos over the rock'n'roll of Louis when it comes to relatively short area majority games for 2 to 4 players. I am very happy to own both, though, and will play both with equal enjoyment and interest. For those interested: I play the 2P game with two variants suggested here on BGG. First, a passive 3rd and 4th player are added (2 influence for player 3, 1 influence for player 4). This crowds the board sufficiently to keep things interesting. But for ultimate fun, you need live dummies.

What was I thinking when I first rated this?  This is fantastic.  The coat of arms scoring is still a bit odd, and a couple of the missions are unbalanced (the one that lets  you place a turn later is ludicrously good for a medium mission), but on the whole, it's a very good game that I want to play more.

I've only played this game once.  The flavor text in the back of the box works against this game.  Your' anticipating a game full of intrigue in the French court but you end up with a game that feels nothing like that. The randomness of the point scoring in the end really puts me off.

4.2.12 I played this game yesterday with high hopes and was not disappointed. Reading through the rules this game reminded me a tiny bit of Kingsburg but is far superior is my opinion. In this game you use influence markers and place them on different spaces. In most cases if you have the most influence on the space you get the benefit for free. If you have some influence on a space you may be able to buy the benefit or if you have a certain number receive it for free. So you are trying to get the most benefit with the least amount of influence. 

At the end of each round you can turn in special tokens you've picked up to gain special benefits for the rest of the game. 

I quite like this game and trying to get the resources you need and hoping someone else doesn't beat you out. Quite possibly my all time second favorite game.

This is another game in the genre of "not being able to do everything you want to" games.  Players use their influence to move amongst nobles to curry favor - but they need particular favors to complete missions and thus make their life easier.  Area control is the name of the game, as only the majority player on each noble's board gets an added benefit.

Perhaps a bit too complex for its own good, but there is an enjoyable game here.  Invest in teaching it to a few friends and then bring it back out with them again.

Not a very good game with 2 players, but works well with 4.

I like most of this game. I feel like it can hurt way too much to do poorly in an early round, though, and fall behind on the missions - you take a hit on points *and* powers. And since people choose what to pursue based mostly on what they need, where they can play, and what's an easy target, there's not much help in "others choosing not to compete as hard with you". It's not [i]always[/i] a problem, but in perhaps 50% of the games I've played, at least one player has suffered from it.

[10/09: Played a game recently where this was very much not the case; the early leader came in a distant 2nd. Unsure if it was random chance, that there were only 3 players, or some other factor.]

Components: Sturdy components, so-so iconography, attractive portraits (though they're all upside down for some players). I wish this had come with a board. The game feels very scattered, and could have benefited with board art to unify the components and enhance the theme. All that need vary on the board are thin tiles that would flip beside each portrait.

Experience: 2014-01-22: Eight and a half years later, and how my tune has changed. Dropping my rating from a 7 to a 5. There are many great mechanisms to like here: variable income; strategic options in playing my influence cards; gaining rewards; building a tableau of powers; flipping the used board tiles. These elements just don't seem to synergize well. Lots of moving pieces that feel like I'm just playing Factory Fun with a different theme: get these two inputs to make this output, which I combine with some other input, to get yet another output. Very fiddly. I'm not drawn to the theme.

2005-06-04: The central mechanism of playing a card and placing pieces on the matching portrait, or to connected portraits, is great; it gives me something to shoot for during the round. After one playing, I dislike the powers associated with the mission cards, because a) it's difficult to keep track of the capabilities of other players, and b) success begets success, making it difficult to catch up.

I bought this game with gift money received at my 40th birthday party in 2005.  I had been researching the game and waiting for it to come out.  It is excellent.  It takes about an hour to play.  2-4 players.  The expansion gives the players a few more options, but doesn't really change the game much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Get some of these to get some of those, fiddle around a bit, eventually get some VPs. Somewhat over-involved Euro that will need more replays than it's likely to get from me to justify the time and effort it'll take to learn the system.

RATING: 7
Very good game.   In one of my first three games the winner was determined by the blind draw of shields.  After all the chances for strategy and intrigue (yes, the game title is accurate) in the placement phases of the game, to have it end up being determined by who chose the best face down tokens seemed like sort of a let down.  After playing the game several more times I have noted that the random shield draw has been a factor in determining who wins the game more often than I am comfortable with in a strategy game.  I'm also noticing that some of the mission cards are much more powerful than others, adding to the luck of the draw being influential in determining the outcome of the game.  Finally, despite what others have said online, we have found the game to be virutally unplayable with three players, almost always resulting in one player being hopelessly out of contention by the end of the second turn.Despite all this, I still rate the game a 7, but that's with four players and carries with it the caveat that there's a lot of potential for random elements to play a major role in determining the winner.

Very nice looking game with a lot of bits and pieces for lots of ways to victory. Feels great as a strategical game, but there's somehow a little bit too much uncontrolled direct conflict. The random factor that was added to the scoring in the end could have been replaced by some better system to give the power markers more importance in my opinion.

A fine Euro. Area control (tactical) meets play to your (random) hand well. Oh yeah, random end point scoring often determines winner.

RATING: 8
Yet another area control game - or person control in this case.  You control people to get tokens to turn in for cards.  Some cards do seem overpowered as compared to others and it can be a bit difficult to catch up on the leader.  The luck portion of the shield scoring is a bit off-putting - hopefully that can be fixed with a variant.  Otherwise, a very enjoyable and nicely strategic game.

Some obtuse rules (for example, all the exceptions that surround the Sun King piece) make the game difficult to wrap one's mind around. But strategically placing influence markers, especially when you don't know how your opponents will react, provides some clever gameplay moments.

The rating might improve with further playthroughs.

EDIT: Rating is actually dropping with further plays. End game scoring feels too arbitrary to be much fun.

I'm a fan of area influence.  Some folks don't like the random endgame bonus and I'm not sure yet if I do or not.  That could easily be removed (or play shields face up) to cut out that random factor. That it can work as a 2 player is also a bonus.  A little hard to teach but once learned can be played pretty quick.

RATING: 8
Great risk management game, disguised as a (temporary) influence game. Strong, well known mechanics, blended in a new, fascinating structure. While almost everything is filled with randomness (money, influence, missions, and insignia), luck plays a lesser role than one would think at first. 

UPDATE (5/06): Dropped from 9 to 8. I still enjoy Louis XIV as much as I did before, but the release of Mykerinos (a faster, more streamlined, less random incarnation) will undoubtly make it harder for Louis XIV hitting the table. As a matter of fact, now Louis falls in the same class of Maharaja, i.e., games with lots of rules and lots of chaos, and I know that this is a combination which appeals to very few players.

I don't have a lot to add to others' comments. The rules are fiddly, especially considering that this  game does not permit long-term planning: just do the best you can with the randomly distributed influence cards that you get each turn and with the essentially randomly selected mission cards that you receive over the course of the game. It's enjoyable enough, but many other games provide a similar experience.

Since I only played this game two times my rating should be considered as temporary. Nevertheless here are a few thoughts I have on this game:

* Although the artwork of the game is really nice, Louis XIV is basically an abstract game.

* I enjoyed both games I played but I noticed that I didnt get too excited while playing. Somehow I couldn´t really see how I could improve my chances to win. But this might change after a few more plays.

* Games seem to end quite close pointwise.

This game is a little too abstract for me.  When a game has a lot of rules, I want it to be thematic.  There are a lot of interesting things going on in the game, enough so that I've played it several times, but there are many other games of similar weight that I'd rather play.

Players are a faction of nobles trying to influence powerful personages in the court of the Sun King.  Okay... players basically play numbered cards that allow influence markers to be sprinkled over the persons, who are layed out in checker-board fashion on the table.  Influence can be jumped to diagonally adjacent persons, in Ruediger Dorn style (see Goa and Traders of Genoa).  Influence gains reward, and reward is spent on missions, and missions pay the highest return of victory points (as well as allow game breaking powers).  All good meaty stuff in a nice small box.  Early days, and lots more to explore here.  Another feather in Alea's cap.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I enjoy and appreciate a lot of the mechanisms in this game, but I just find the winner-takes-all reward mechanism unsatisfying, especially with unfriendly ties (which also prevent the tile from being flipped to the losers-can-buy side).

RATING: 5
Abbreviated El Grande. Lackluster but decent.

Lacking a lot in the theme department - couldn't they have just added a little something to ground you? Sprinkling words like "intrigue, blackmail, seduction, and bribery" would go a long way to making me care about the movement of cubes around a board. And bylines for the people - I'm not going to have everyone I teach the game to read the historical notes in the rules. Putting the words "shady Treasurer" or "King's mistress" really really make people feel that they are doing something that matters more than scoring points. And the "special powers" you earn, c'mon, Give it a Name!! What are these, they're not missions, they're favors and kickbacks you're earning on behalf of provincials and minor nobles. I've hardly ever seen such a natural shoo-in for theme be so blunderingly avoided by Alea at all costs.

RATING: 5
The spiritual precursor to Notre Dame.   Some elements are exactly the same:  playing cards to determine where your active influence is placed, and the need to activate more of your influence markers from reserves.   This game is a bit more spatial, as you have to compete for the different tiles, and that's the best element.   There's a high amount of randomness in the shield drawing and the card drawing.   That seemed a bit awkward.   The theme is pretty much a "miss" and should not count towards any kind of Humanities credit.  Given the choice, I think I'd always choose Notre Dame over Louis.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Usually not a big fan of conventional area majority games, but this one is special. Perhaps I enjoyed the spatial linking mechanism.

Lots of micromanagement, but it was complex in an intuitive way that made sense and offered real variety instead of being more of the same. Dorn is the master of clean busy designs, if that makes sense.

I always felt good when playing this game. It's super quick (just 4 rounds) and yet so deep. It feels light to me (very subjective, depending on a person's gaming experience) but still offers deep and meaning decisions.

Good that it comes in a small package.

Legalábbis a pajzsoknál mindenképp -bár mi azért az 5-t látsz és abból választasz alapján játszottuk, ami picit javít. Az nagy kérdés maradt bennem, h vajon a húzott/osztott kártyák mennyire befolyásolják a játékot, mert csúnyán nyertem -sok-sok ponttal- és nem éreztem, h extra jó lapjaim lettek volna, de a többiek szerint nem nagyon volt lehetőségük blokkolni az én terveim. Illetve az biztos látszik, h a teljesített feladat kártyák nagy pozitívumokat ad az egyes játékosoknak, tehát arra érdemes ráfeküdni az elején nagyon /azaz 2-t kijátszani az első fordulóban/. Szóval legyen mondjuk 8. /Igazából 7-8 de közelebb a 8-hoz/

I played Louis XIV just twice so far and it was a 2 player game and a 4 player game.

I need to try Louis XIV a little more with 3 or 4 players to give Louis XIV a proper rating. I understood the a bit game more in the 4 player game.

I need a few more plays to learn the value each character in the game. It would help to have a better idea on how Louis XIV works and what is best when it`s your turn.

You are limited by the cards you have. Some characters are better than others, but you can't be everywhere on each turn and think you'll be first or second everywhere.

Louis XIV is not an easy game to master. It takes a couple of game to get the hang of things.

The more I play, the better understanding I have. It`s becoming one of my favorites.

An excellent new offering by Ruediger Dorn, an almost perfect game of considerable decision making trees. Where should I place my influence pawns? Should I try to fulfill missions or go for the insignia? Has for me the same potential as  "Puerto Rico" for continuous replay and "let's play again because I want to try something different" value. And it even takes aways very little physical space in your collection! But don't expect strong theme here, this is a very abstract game that creates little historic atmosphere...
The only slight problem is with the final additional VP's for insignia majority, that seems to jar with the perfect rest of the game (as it is pure luck of the draw, with no way to influence it), but it is possible to leave that rule away and just treat the insignia as simple VP's.

RATING: 6
I put this one in the same category as the other classic Kramer and Knizia titles of the early 2000s. Very dry, and not very sexy compared to today's offerings (amazing how much things have changed in less than 10 years already), but a solid play. The theme is pretty much tacked on and you're pushing wooden bits around some intricate rules, but if you want to play a clever area control game, this is as good a choice as any.

Like El Grande, it's a very tactical exercise, and there's a bit of randomness that bothers a lot of players. For me, I didn't mind the random card draws or even the notorious endgame shield scoring. Reminds me a bit of Goa in that good play will put you in the position to win and then you need to get a little lucky.

Years ago this would've come off the shelf with some regularity but now the design feels surpassed. It does suffer from a heavy rules overhead, so best to play with people who already know how to play it, otherwise there are better games for 4P that take a while to teach.

Suggested variant from Xssassin:

We use the suggested rule where your initial hand of missions is 1/1/1, maximum of 3, rather than 1/1/0, maximum of 2, and for the life of me I cannot figure out why this wouldn't just be the default. Are you supposed buy your medium, then draw a hard and hope you can play it with one wild and another leftover hex? C'mon. Also this reduces the odds of the dreaded "every mission in my hand shows the same symbol" mishap.

RATING: 4
Wow. I really didn't like this. An influence game where you get bits which you convert into missions or shields, but where you place influence is hard to control, which missions you get are random, which shields you get are random, but actually, you're trying to get majorities in shields to gain more shields??? What the heck is going on? Waay to complex rules, so many fiddly bits, and so hard to actually get a result. Well, I found it very hard, but others had an easier time. I would compare this with Mykeniros, unfavourably. Mykerinos is a very similar style of game, majority influence in areas, personal and general pool, special abilities you collect in the game, working towards a scoring mechanism, 4 playing rounds, just very very much simpler. Don't buy Louis XIV, buy Mykerinos.

Deep game in such a small box.  Nice graphic design on the cards & tiles.  A "gamer's game" for sure, but I feel it slightly suffers due to the luck of the shield bonuses at game end.  There are a lot of "fiddly" rules to teach which is compounded by the constant flipping of the tiles.  Even so, the brainburning apsect makes it a rewarding experience that might also be improved by one of the posted variants.  Grade: B

No me gusta los juegos influencos. I really wish I could appreciate influence games, but I just don't get the appeal of them. Further, I don't like the "chain movement" mechanic. And I wish the game had a booard instead of tiles. And I really wish they'd chosen a different theme. And I don't like how the game is only 4 rounds long not allowing for the explotation of some of the actions tiles you win in the game. *sigh*

There are a number of similar mechanics from Traders of Genoa and that is a good thing.  The flow of the game feels like card-driven masterpieces like Paths of Glory and that is a wonderful thing.  Playing time is perfectly balanced for the experience (once you get the rules nailed down which takes some getting used to) and that is nice thing.  My initial impression is that there could be a runaway problem with some of the missions if they are realized early.  This is purely based on a first try so rating will likely change.

Great little area control game with unequal valuations.  I really like how the board tiles flip or not each round.  It scales perfectly from 2-4.  Sometimes I feel it's a little high on the luck, and sometimes I don't.  Either way it's hard to fault it for the length and it's a tried and true classic in my book.

[Resource Management, Area Majority] [4P:8, 3P:7] Hey, not bad for what is, on the suface, an area control game. Area control is just a median mechanism. The heart of the game is a cute, sort-of-complicated-and-clunky resource system which has the player trying to navigate an equation of converting time (represented by influence cards) into victory points (represented by coats-of-arms and mission cards). Everyone starts with four influence cards to play, then tries to parley those cards into more cards and resources via the "board" abilities and mission card advantages. It feels a lot like Goa, interestingly, replacing the auctions with the area majority engine. The aim is the same - generate more actions and resources by investing wisely - sort of like the Extra Actions and Development Tracks in Goa. Yes, there is quite a bit of randomness/luck here, what with four different card draws (money, influence, intrigue, and especially mission) and the coat of arms chit pulls. A lot's been made about the coat of arms chits, but I suspect the mission card draws influence the game far more than the couple of VPs that lucky majorities in coats of arms will give you. I don't mind the randomess because the resource relationships are so interesting. Overall, it's a nice little game in a nice little box. *** UPDATE: OK, so we underestimated this game. It's by far the most difficult Eurogame we have ever played. The timing and rhythm of the game gives me fits, and the confrontation within the game is very bloody. Ouch. You're not getting anything elegant here; it's a bunch of clockwork parts that you have to try to get moving with precision, or else you're really going to get screwed. There's only one way to win in this game, and it's to win brutally and ugly. Fits the game theme of politicking and intrigue to a T. I can't think of any other game I've played that's anywhere near the character of Louis XIV. This is a heavier-than-mediumweight game in the class of 5P Puerto Rico (okay, it's heavier than that), with about as much elegance (which is saying not much). Good game, worth owning and playing, but I like Goa a lot more due to the premium I put on game elegance. *** UPDATE: Definitely gets better the more the players are familiar with the game and the abilities conferred by the tiles and the mission cards. Very strong effort from Dorn, certainly just as impressive as Goa.

(Old pre-acquisition commentary follows)
March 2005. Rudiger Dorn + alea + renaissance theme = add to game library. Have high hopes that the usual alea production values will improve the look of the game from the Essen 04 pix. "Mid-sized" box a slight concern - would have been more comfortable if it was a big box release, screw the extra $. But with this title now tag-teaming with the Knizia title "Palazzo" as a 1-2 opening punch, this new mid-sized game line looks like it'll get some serious push. *** UPDATE: With Im Schatten and Turmzau falling by the wayside, this is now my top want along with Palazzo. I hear area majority, but not 1st 2nd 3rd, plus I hear "luck of the draw", "strange scoring" and "lots and lots of options". Sounds good, sign me up. (UPDATE: Just acquired! Yeah!)

RATING: 8
The theme excited me, the play intrigued me, but the end result was not what was expected.  My initial rating of 7 may rise after more play, but so far I am not overly impressed.  Competent players are likely to remain roughly equal during the game and make the final scoring of coat-of-arms more crucial than it ought to be.

I could be wrong, only more plays will tell.

UPDATE 07DEC05:  I am taking a different view of the coat-of-arms; also last night's game seemed a lot less bland and all enjoyed it.  Rating upped one place; but the doubt is still there and there is nothing to stop it dropping.

Smooth and fun influence strategy. This came out the same time as "Shadow of the Emperor" but this one totally blows it away (it takes more than cool theme to make a game guys!). I only wish the bits were of excellent quality to match the gameplay. They work though. I like it even though i lose each time due to obtaining those little victories throughout the game as you win over the nobles. I have played with 4 players only but I estimate that 4 is best.

Louis XIV is a clever area control game that seems a little unusual for the alea small-box series. It isn't really difficult to explain but the amount of rules required for such a small title can be intimidating at first. Once you've gotten past that it still is somewhat fiddly, but in a good way.

All of the favours that can be garnered at the royal court are useful in one way or another, and while the card draws provide a good deal of randomness it never feels game-breaking. There is enough to think about without being overwhelming, and a lot of competition on the field. A compact and compelling little package.

So nice to finally play this game.  It feels convoluted at first, but is actually a very simple Euro point-fest.  Has lots of little things going on that definitely demand repeat plays and consideration. The theme is virtually abstract (though I have read there are connections between the represented Persons and their effects), but the game plays well regardless of theme. LXIV has lots of things in it that are signature of a Dorn design, and it all comes together nicely. Lots of luck in this one too, but it's manageable luck and I like that in a game. This is not a game that would get everyone excited, but I find it a real solid entry for gamers who enjoy a cleaver use of mechanics in a typical Euro-style game. Would never recommend this as a 2-player game though. It really needs a full complement of 4 players.

Played with 2, 3 and 4 players.  It is a very different game at each number, and I'm not sure it works well with any less than 4. With three, if one person follows a "spread out" strategy during a round - it seems necessary for the other two players to cooperate to stop them from getting too much benefit. If one of them chooses not to, then the other must do so or they both lose out to the third player.  Sort of a game of "chicken".   A good game, on the heavy side.  It seems O.K. with 2, but we found that certain card combinations can create huge advantages for one player, and with only two people playing, it can be difficult to recover.  The jury is out on this one... UPDATE:  I played again with 4 players and have decided that it really needs 4 to rate a "7".  The reason I rate it no higher is because there is just too much posibility of a non-in contention player being "thumped" because his card-draw happens to match what someone else is trying to do.  It also has a bit of a runaway leader problem.   I would rate it much lower with 3 or less players.

I've got a lot of love for this one. It really shines with 4 players. This game can be very stressful at turns with grueling decisions that need to be made. The more avenues you have access to the less confidence you seem to have in picking one. As you play more, you get a better sense on how to best set yourself up for the next round, and the fact that it is a tight game with only 4 rounds leaves you with a great deal of long term strategizing capabilities. With the amount of different roads you can take, each of them manage to be impressively balanced, there certainly aren't any useless tiles.

A lot of people mention the coat of arms 'luck' factor that seems to be just thrown in there. I think though it's more a probability thing, if you go MAINLY for coats of arms you still have a fighting chance because of that little scoring rule. I'm sure Dorn knew what he was doing, and you can always ignore that small rule if you don't agree.

To me, it seems the greatest imbalance is in the mission card rewards. Some offer GREAT benefits where your opponents really feel it. Others of the same cost are hardly beneficial.

Playing this one though is just a blast. It's a brain burner, you've got to consider a lot of possibilities with each move. With each game you can pursue a different avenue in attempts to win, but win or lose, it's a real gem in terms of gameplay experience.

Offers some nice depth for a game in a smallish box with no board. It does have some flaws: the rules are complex and difficult to teach, and it is annoying to have to keep track of all the other players' gradually increasing abilities.

I dislike the random shield bonuses, and generally play without that rule.

Reminds me of Mykerinos and that's good. No actual board, double sided tiles, sponsors, scoring at the end - there are many similarities. The one thing that Louis makes worse than Mykerinos is the way of resolving of majorities and separate rules for each type of tiles. It doesn't make the gameplay better and may create some confusion.

But apart of that it's an outstanding euro-game. Definitely worth playing.

Louis XIV is very fun with two players, using the following official Alea two-player variant to the standard two-player rules. (I found this varient in a forum thread and rephrased here for my convenience).

Setup: Use 6 round cards instead of 4. In addition to materials for the two real players (the start player and the other player), use influence markers for two neutral (dummy) players: 
- For the first (1st) dummy player, use 8 influence markers.
- For the second (2nd) dummy player, use 4 influence markers.

Influence phase: Place the dummy players' influence markers according the following rules:

1. Place two markers for the 1st dummy player on the tile with Louis X1V. 
2. Draw an influence card, and place one marker for the 2nd dummy player on the corresponding tile.
3. If you are the start player, play one influence card from your hand and place your markers as normal.
4. If you are the other player, play one influence card from your hand and place your makers as normal.
5. Draw an influence card, and place two markers for the 1st dummy player on the corresponding tile.
6. Draw an influence card, and place one marker for the 2nd dummy player on the corresponding tile.
7. Repeat steps 3 through 6 until you place all neutral markers.
8. When all dummy players' markers are placed, continue in turn order to play your influence cards from your hands and place your markers, discarding your last cards as normal.
Note: If you draw a wild influence card for a dummy player, discard it and redraw.

Scoring: A dummy player can win a board (and the board is flipped as usual) or tie for a board, but does not receive any rewards. If a dummy player wins board six, do not place an additional marker.

I like Louis XIV quite a lot, despite some nagging reservations. Let’s get the reservations out of the way first. The game is perhaps a bit overwrought. Systems are layered upon systems, and almost all of it is governed by card draws. There are several consequences of this design style.

First, the game is hard to teach. The level of rules overhead is high. This is more of a nuisance than a serious flaw, with one exception. The rules for what happens in Louis’s district are so convoluted that I find myself having to look them up every time I play.

Secondly, the game is rife with randomness. In general, I don’t mind randomness. The most common criticism of Louis XIV is the luck inherent in the end-game shield bonuses. Does this bother me? No, not really. Without it, I think the endgame would be too calculable. What’s more bothersome is the way that players are repeatedly handcuffed by the cards they draw. You get pot luck, and then you just have to plan out the best course of action based on the fate of the cards. I don’t mind reactive games like this, but Louis XIV really rubs the lack of control in your face: random income and Louis placement, random influence cards, random intrigue cards, random mission cards, etc. The rules complexity of Louis XIV makes me think that it wants to be a strategic planning game. But it never quite gets there, staying on the level of tactics and reaction.

As a game of tactics and reaction, though, Louis XIV is a success. The game gives you your cards just in the nick of time, allowing you to cobble together a short-term plan of action to make the best of your situation. There are a lot of interesting nooks and crannies in the tactical decisionmaking, making for an engrossing game. At least for four players. The game stinks with three in my experience, for two reasons. The first problem is that the turn order is imbalanced, with one player getting to go last twice – which is huge in this game. The second problem, the real game-breaker, is that there is not nearly enough competition on the board with less than four players. The players’ pieces will be spread too thinly across the tiles, sucking the tension and drama from the game like I suck the marrow from my Osso Bucco.

I'm not sure that Louis XIV has aged very well. I'm inclined to decrease my rating, but I'll leave it due to how much I enjoyed this game at one time. Really was a favorite for a while. It will stay in my collection out of hope that one day it comes out of the dust, and I rediscover its glory.

A good area control game, which is much determined by the cards you draw. It also feels quite tactical, but with nice interaction.

RATING: 8.5
Nine plays, once with two players, once with three, otherwise with four. I really enjoy the game play of this one, as each new twist and turn is unique in its pressures and demands, and the start of each round has the delightful feeling of picking through a well-stocked tackle box and trying to guess which of the shiny whatnots and colorful dangly doo-dads is going to land the most fish. However, like a well-stocked tackle box, Louis XIV is also rather inelegant. Another analogue might be that of a fanciful Enlightenment-era clockwork toy: finely tuned and dazzling in its intricacy, yet excessive, cold and hard to explain. I'd also like to say that there is something of a missed opportunity here, because I feel like the theme is convincingly built into the game but the publisher(s) didn't work hard enough to bring it out into the open. Even just a little flavor text on the influence and mission cards would have made a colossal difference, not to mention a suitable explanation as to what the coats-of-arms really represent. I understand that it is most likely economics that kept this from being the big-box game it should have been (Louis XIV is nothing if not a hobbyist's game), but that doesn't change the fact that Alea needs to work harder at selling their themes.

alea is back to its former glory. This game is a classic! You have so many options to pursue that you never quite know where to begin. Yeah, I know that some options are far better than others - but it is often better to take 2 or 3 less optimal actions than competing for the big ones. I love this game!

A good game that seems way too fiddly upon first learning the rules. While playing, however, the rules come together fairly well. Others have said that the shields throw off the scoring at the end, and I can see that, though I don't necessarily think it breaks the game. Best to have this one taught to you by someone who knows it well. 

**UPDATE** Played again and liked it much better the second time. Although there are many little rules, they all fit together and become second nature fairly easily. Would like to try with four to see the difference.

**UPDATE** Okay, the shields kinda suck. The gameplay is interesting and interactive, but the shield scoring is completely random. It undermines the work put in during the game to have your final score determined by something completely out of your control. Dropped rating a full point.

Clever, card-driven area influence game, that plays pretty quickly, but which has interesting decisions. 

A downside for me was the fact that the theme didn't come through very well... We could have been influencing anyone for anything really, and in a purely thematic sense, the scoring at the end didn't feel very satisfying.

Two-player is not very interesting, but the four player version looks pretty good.  Three player is a bit too easy to complete missions.  Complexity of what is the "best move"(not how to play) has driven away a few potential opponents.

Strategy : You have to get at least both mission every turn (except maybe the 1st turn, but if you can on the first turn, then you will most likely win.).  Other then the "missions", you need to use combo moves. Use these to position your self for a strong next turn.

RATING: 8
This is a surprisingly tactical game that really makes you think about your available options and weigh them up carefully. There's a nice balance between completing missions and securing victory points, and the mechanics for getting your markers back from a space if you lose, and losing them if you win, work very well to balance the play and keep all players honest. The main reason I don't give this a higher rating is the coat of arms scoring factor at the end: this is completely random, and could undo all of your hard work at the end of the game by handing victory to an opponent that you have in every other respect outplayed for the whole game. To be fair, though, this has not actually happened in any game I've played so far, so perhaps the potential for that to happen is not such a problem. One other minor criticism: the missions contain no "flavour text" to describe what you're actually trying to do. This is not massively detrimental, and does not affect gameplay at all; rather, it's a missed opportunity to better reflect the theme. I should also mention there's a Louis XIV figure available in toy stores that looks much better on the table than the token that comes with the game: well worth getting hold of one.

This is a thinking game, as you try to gain mission tokens by gaining the favor (majority of influence tokens) of a member of the court.  Influence placement mechanic is quite interesting, and the game has many subtleties.  Good reply value!

There is a bit of luck with the influence cards you are dealt, but this is practically negated since you have the option of moving influence tokens to an adjacent character, not to mention that you always have an extra influence card (therefore you will be discarding the least valuable).

RATING: 8
As the third member of Dorn's "Tailing Tower" Trilogy (I really don't think that that's a thing, but it's the common mechanical element between Louis XIV, Goa, and Traders of Genoa), it's a phenomenal area majority game for four. I would even go to say that it might even be the best area majority game with 4 (El Grande being the best with 5 and San Marco being the best with 3). The risk taking/management in this is wrenching. Sure, there are safe bets when courting Louis' inner circle, but you don't win if you don't take chances (on your group, as well as attempting to fulfill missions sight unseen).

Clever but unintuitive mechanics gel together to make a satisfying game, if you're able to keep all the rules and special actions in your head.

[Initial Impression: 7] 
There are several options to track, which I like, but overall the game feels clunky and inelegant. Some mechanisms almost seem added just for the sake of having "more". For example, the Intrigue cards and being able to take an extra Influence card add options, but at the expense of decreasing predictability of placements. Some character rewards seem clearly better than others, especially close to the end-game.  For a 2-player game, use the Alea 2-player variant, which has 2 dummies and positions them before each set of player turns during the influence phase. This strengthens the dummies and provides more competition/tension.

The only flaw is that the random-ness of drawing the shields which plays too big of a role on the scoring. Other than that, its a great game. Love the theme.

One of my top, top games of all time.

I don't normally enjoy area majority games, but this one is different.

It punishes overextension and greediness, but if you're too meek you stand a chance of losing out on all presented opportunities.

You need to tread lightly enough not to rock the boat, but not too lightly so as not to make any impact.  Much as you'd expect of a life of intrigue in the Sun King's court.

The game has been criticized for unbalanced mission cards and too much luck with family crests in the final scoring, but I strongly disagree with both those sentiments.

I don't usually like area majority games but this one is a very good one.  You are trying to get rewards by placing as few influence as possible on as many charcaters as possible.  Look like a filler at first with its simple rules and streamlined gameplay but is significantly heavier.

Wow.  I love this game.  I am a big fan of Rudiger Dorn.  His games really resonate with me.  This is a fantastic area control game.  The theme is wonderful, with beautiful cards with pictures of the members of the court of Louis XIV.  I've been playing the official Alea two player variant and it plays very very well.  There are two phantom people in the game.  It's very easy to think of those cubes as additional influences on the various members of the court.  It makes perfect sense to me and it feels very comfortable.  Most importantly it creates tension in the game.  This, Reef Encounter, Goa, and Caylus are my favorite medium to heavy two-player board games.

I love area control games & with the 'special powers' you get by completing missions I thought this would be brilliant.

However: I found it just a bit too fiddly (in terms of rules, scoring, pieces everywhere, etc.) & the choices available to me didn't really excite me or require too much thought, perhaps since the true value of the outcomes (in terms of winning the game) was quite indirect.  On top of that I just couldn't get into the theme.

I think I can understand why other people like it but ultimately it wasn't a difficult decision when I was offered a trade for it.

Louis XIV is actually quite well designed.  It's not heavy but remains surprisingly strategic with a touch of luck.  However, the Coat of Arms scoring is a little too luck based for the type of game it is and could sure be sour if it ended up deciding the winner.  It really isn't as good for less than three players though (with fewer it's pretty laissez faire).  Still, for four you'd be mighty pressed to find as good a game...

This is another quality game from Mr. Dorn.  My only complaint would be the fiddliness of the bits during setup and gameplay.  It seems like a lot of the gameplay time is just bookeeping with (moving the various bits and tokens).  I had a similar complaint with his earlier title Jambo, but it seems like there is even more fiddly crap to move around in this version.  I really like the game, but think it would play faster and more enjoyably using a PC interface that handles all the bit shuffling for you (even if all of us were simply in the same room around the same one or two laptops.)

RATING: 6.5
This is truly impressive territory-control game at first (initially, it had '9' from me).  You can feel perfectly oiled, great-working mechanics.  You see many decisions and you are excited by the competition for court persons' favours.

But after several games I was not so thrilled.  The game has worn out for me - I see 2 major strategies (missions and coats-of-arms) and feel the repetitivness of the gameplay.

The rating is probably a bit unfair considering really good mechanics of the game, but it just reflects my desire to play the title..

RATING: 8
The rating based on 4-player games. When treated as a 2-player - much better IMO. But the random drawing of shields annoys me. In most of our games the result was very close, so the random drawing decided the winner. Plus some missions are much weaker than others and the lucky draw can give some players big advantage.

RATING: 7.5
This game was interesting. I liked the way you spread the influence across the board, which changes the card draw from being completely random to being something that you have to react to cleverly. My copy came with the mini-expansion, which added a nice twist to even out some luck and make more spots more interesting while not really adding much complexity. My one concern was that some of the power cards seem imbalanced. In particular the cards that give you any kind of stalling action are incredibly powerful, since they let you react to everyone else. The guy who started with the mid tier card that let him take an action to draw 1 discard 1 completely ran away with the game. But otherwise it was pretty solid, I'd like to try it again, maybe with just a few of those cards thrown out.

RATING: 8.5
Rated after two two-player games.  After a rough first game, where I totally blew the first two rounds and got routed, the second game was much closer, tense and fun.  Similar to Mykerinos this game moves along quickly with only four rounds to gain the upper hand.  Dorn's "snail-trail" placement mechanism works well and forces tough choices as you would like to focus both on the inside and outside of the board.  Even with two certain areas are fought over and the "dummy" third player does his job in making certain boards tougher.  Another winner from Rüdiger Dorn!

First impression:  Overly complex, but an interesting tactical game.  One annoying aspect is by the end of the game, each player has acquired several special powers, but the text & icons on the cards are so small, it's hard to keep them straight.  I'd play again, but I'm not anxious to get it to the table soon.

Very abstract influence game nominally about court intrigue in the court of the Sun King. Players play cards to put influence tokens on a number of nobles. Rewards are given for control of these nobles, and the rewards are used to buy mission cards, which are the primary source of end-game victory points.

Louis XIV, while definitely a solid game is definitely better with more players. Even so, like Goa I feel it is overwrought and slightly repetitive. Rüdiger seems to like piling rules and mechanisms into his games. One type of cards? Two types? No no no, in L14 you get gold cards, influence cards, mission cards (in three subtypes), and intrigue cards, and don't even get me started on influence "barrels", mission chips, coats of arms, gold coins, 12 different nobles, and the Louis figure. So, lots of different types of "things" all interacting - just like in Goa - but like that game it feels like a little too much for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The game is divided into four phases, but the only one that really matters is the area control phase.  Here is where people earn the pieces that will be used to complete missions.  Completed missions provide advantages in later rounds as well as score more points than anything else in the game.  I think the missions are overpowered and which missions are drawn can give a lot of an advantage.  As such, there is a good deal of luck in drawing good missions, but I have always liked a little luck in my games.

Played with both 2 and 4.

As a 2 player game, it is playable, but suffers from a run-away leader problem.  

With 4, this is an extremely tense game with tight decisions.  There is an element of luck in the cards you get dealt, but the movement rules and get 5 play 4 rule help a player control this.

The only problem we can see is the unbalanced distribution of "hard" missions.  Not getting as many as the other players is a huge disadvantage, and the distribution will not be even.  Also, is the "4 influence joker" mission too strong, even as a "hard" mission?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

It isn't often that I initially rate a game '10,' but this one has it all... money, random card play, limited turn actions, influence, a unique scoring system, relatively quick play time and it's just plain fun.

Rüdiger Dorn has taken some tried and true mechanics, mixed well, and designed a near perfect game.  One of the 'must have' games of 2005 (if only to keep your alea collection complete), it has definitely lived up to all of the hype.

If Dorn keeps pumping out games like Louis XIV, Emerald, Traders of Genoa, Jambo and Goa... he will fast become my favourite game designer!

Preliminary Rating: Another of this years crop of games that failed to excite me. The game play itself seemed boring. Place your markers to get the necessary goods to fulfill your missions and manage your control tokens for the following round. Maybe I'm becoming jaded by having played many other similar games before this one.  

Second play showed that there seem to be some mission cards that have nicer abilities than others. That's okay it just play a part in my rating of the game. 

It is possible to be dealt placement cards that are not favorable for completing your missions and in a four turn game where one more mission can make the difference that hurts.

Good, solid game that was played quite a bit when it first came out, but haven't played much since.

RATING: 9
New Comment as of 10/2009:

Louis XIV was one of the first modern games I discovered. I used to be quite enchanted with it. The level of polish and intricacy here are both quite impressive. You have a limited amount of influence to wield at court (couriers, bribes, let your imagination run wild - or read Dangerous Liasons). All of the favors are worth winning, but the key is to stay out of escalating contests with other players, so that you win more favors more often. 

There are lots of little facets here. The basic premise is that you need the most influence with a given courtier to win (area majority), but sometimes it's winner takes all, sometimes you have the option to bribe even if you're in last, and sometimes it's a free-for all with a qualifying cut-off (awarded to everyone who places two influence, for example). These variations represent the changing mood at court, and add a small but appreciable dimension to the game's replayability. Each game you will build up unique advantages over your teammates based on your successes at court. Some say the key to the game is going last (which is a variable player power available in a few different guises), but I don't think it's a completely overpowering strategy. 

Anyway, "intricate" is a good word for this game. Not heavy, not super complex, but intricate. I've played 2 hour games of this and hope to never repeat the experience. I used to think this was a reliably 90 minute game. Perhaps with new gamers. If you have experience with games, you will recognize the various elements that are blended here, and this can make for a snappy hour of game play.

I learned this game two weeks after Notre Dame which is similar in that you wonder about the many symbols and interacting mechanisms when the game is explained. For me, Louis won the direct comparison. The player interaction through battling for majorities guarantees that there is no single way to victory or scripted strategies that are followed (Notre Dame, St. Petersburg etc.). The game focus is tactical as each round the objective is to get the most out of the cards drawn to fulfil the missions on hand. Too heavy and confusing for casual gamers though.

I consider the rating to be highly volatile at this point, since I've only played 2-player so far.  I like the basic mechanisms of the game, it has just the right amount of luck (I don't think the mission cards are overwhelmingly disruptive, but then again I'm not very experienced) with many different options and paths to victory.  I have to admit, even though I really like France, the theme doesn't appeal to me.  Maybe I don't like that era of France's history.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
When I think back, I realise how abstract the game really is. But its something you don't notice while playing it. This game is fantastic. It plays so well, and all the mechanisms blend in very nicely. Its reminiscent of El Grande, but it feels like it has more meat on it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Have played it only once: a neat area control game which genre I like. The key is to manage your servants well and carefully throughout the game, and make good decisions as to where when and how many servants you place. Compared with El Grande this game seems lighter a little bit. I love the theme! Who does not admire the Sun King, France, Versailles  and who would not want to gain his favour! 
A great review: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/471766

Update: fine and delicate choices, and the game offers quite a few options (not as many as EG). A tense and entertaining game. We still have a lot to discover as to what strategies we want to play. The game plays fast. I like how the boards are different in that if you do not win you can either buy the reward or do not get anything. It is fair how you put back your servants either in your general or private supply according to whether you are the first on a piece of board or not. Lots of replayability too. Easy rules but complex game play - I like this combination.
As it is true with EG, I think Louis XIV is also better with three and especially with four players. More tense and more player interaction.
To me it is harder to control your supply than it is in EG, but will see with more plays.

A good game which is mechanically strong. The game is highly tactical because your play is dominated by the cards you draw.

I really think this game is underrated and is among the best board games ever made. The game does require a lot of concentration and that may not appeal to some people.

It has many interesting choices, tactics, and planning. You have to respond to contingencies if rival players show interest in something valuable to you. The end of game scoring is fine - it adds a very slight random element that should help reduce analysis paralysis and keep the game interesting till the very end for all players. If you don't like the minor luck factors play three games instead of one to determine the "real" winner.

The theme is definitely on the dry side (gaining favour in the court of Louis XIV), although I'm not too drawn to the forthcoming animal mob theme either. Those that have played Istanbul will recognize the movement mechanism in Louis XIV, but the difference is that the actions on each tile are executed in order at the end of the round, and if you have the most pieces on a tile you get special benefits.

PLayed it as 4 player and as 2 player. It is a lot similar to El Grande, so if you like that game you will like this one too. It scales well in both cases and we really enjoyed it. It is pretty heavy for a small box game. I also have a soft spot for area control type games. Definitely worht $20 we spend on it.

One of my favorite games.  If you are not ready for it the game can turn ugly on you very fast and leave you sitting there wondering what happened.  Love the aggressiveness of the game.  but the best part is the actual playing field changes each turn there by making a total game spanning strategy hard (6/3)

RATING: 8
Another enjoyable area control game.  Though played with cards, they really just substitute for the board and Louis XIV is in no way a card game.  The collection of favors rewarded analysis and good strategy without seeming too dry.  Some have criticised using the shields for victory points, but to me it seemed a good way to avoid AP.

Similar to El Grande in some ways, but quite different in others. I enjoy this game more than El Grande for a number of reasons - artwork, theme, hidden strategy and less "analysis paralysis". It's not a home run, but certainly a solid triple.

RATING: 7.5
I find this game to be very enjoyable, but it's a little short on player interactions that you can predict to your own strategic benefit. That is, there is very little way to predict what certain players might do to you, given their own states. You can only prepare in a generally defensive way, by choosing strategies which are harder for any player to destroy. I think this is acceptable mainly because it is different from a lot of the scheming strategy games that I tend to enjoy, where you can take very direct action against a particular player (and where you can also predict the possibility of actions against yourself by specific others).

Played first time in Helcon2005 (10/2005). Liked it a lot so bought it right away. Louis XIV has an interesting game-mechanic (althought it is "just influence game") and scoring-system. The coat-of-arms -"bingo" doesn't fit to the game, but it's just a minor problem. This is a great game!

[2008.Feb.19] Rüdiger Dorn designed this clever game that models the political intrigue in Louis XIV's court via an area majority mechanism. Best played with 4, this game requires cunning use of your limited influence. Do you have what it takes to make your agenda a reality?

i'd read about louis xiv in the past and wasn't all that interested in it, but then i got a chance to actually play it and enjoyed it a lot. i like games with secret missions and variable player powers so i love that aspect of the game, i think if variable player powers were listed as a mechanic on the game page i'd have been more interested from the beginning, and they need to add secret missions/goals as a mechanic choice for all games.

High design quality that you would expect from Kramer.  Light & fast play with nice worker placement towards area control.  Still decent depth and strategy but only partial player control (random cards, random missions) which speed things up and keep things fluid.  Not a deep gamers' game but still meatier than Ticket to Ride and the likes.  Combined with the quick play, definitely has a place in a collection.

RATING: 6
An abstract "open bidding" game of acquiring Personages (role cards) to win VPs (accomplish missions and accumulate shields).  Managing your 2 seperate supply piles of influence markers plays an important role also.  Mechanics mesh together well and there is bidding player interaction.  Only experience will give you an idea of what tiles are worth what in combo with others so it has a bit of a learning curve for a middle-light game...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Almost too short as a two player game with too much space and too little conflict (although that might have been due to the playing styles of the two of us and trying to learn the game).  I doubt I will ever play this game unless it is with four in the future.  My one play with four was very tight and competitive with some intense fighting over tiles.

RATING: 5
Ez a játék nem fogott meg túlságosan. Hárman játszottuk, és nem volt rossz, de szörnyen rövidnek éreztem, hogy csak 3 körből állt. A lapokon a német szövegek ijesztőek voltak, de szerencsére nem volt szükség némettudásra, mert a kis ábrák mindent elárultak. A kelleténél szerencsefüggőbbnek érzem, ráadásul nagyon könnyű semlegesíteni egy játékost benne, azaz elérni, hogy szinte semennyi pontot ne tudjon szerezni a körében (és összesen ugye csak 3 kör van). Emiatt aztán 3 játékos esetén nem olyan jó, mint pl. 4 játékosnál lehet, mert ha valamelyik játékos keresztbe tesz egy másiknak, akkor egyikük sem fejlődik (vagy csak alig), a nevető harmadik pedig elhúz pontszámban.
Játszanék még vele, mert élvezem, hogy nehéz döntéseket kell hozni, de nem lesz sosem egy kedvenc játékom, mert alig néhány döntés után vége is van. És túlságosan szerencsefüggő.

Update: Mint utólag kiderült, néhány hibás szabállyal játszottunk. Például nem 3, hanem 4 körből áll a játék, ami javít a rövidségét illető kritikámon. Több lehetőséget és nagyobb mélységet ad neki az, hogy az elején nem csak 5, hanem jóval több bábum van, azaz nem kell annyi erőforrást fektetni a bábuk beszerzésére. Meg talán egyéb hibákat is vétettünk, nem tudom. Meg kellene próbálni a játékot még egyszer, ezúttal a szabályos játékra odafigyelve.

Played once. 

The game has potential. I like how the space in the board is utilized. I'm not a big fan of the special powers on the mission cards as some are more helpful than others. If you are able to complete some decent missions, then you seem to have a big advantage to win. If you are stuck with crappy powers, then you are probably in trouble.

This game is very well done. Scores in my group of gamers are always very very close at the end. Some of us have a slight problem with the shield counter scoring at the end of the game but overall it's an extremely fun area influence game.Rating adjusted down to a 7 after owning this one for about 2 years. Still think it's a good game but a few other Area Control games have come out that have taken away from our need to pull out good old Louis much anymore. But I still won't say no if someone asks to play!

RATING: 8
This is an very good game that I think may be suffering a bit from mistaken expectations.  The smaller box size and moderate price may be leading people to think that this is a "gamer's" middleweight a la Ra or Saint Petersburg.

It's not.

Louis XIVth is a heavyweight game, in the same weight class as Torres, Puerto Rico or Princes of Florence.  There are numerous systems at work together here, producing tough decisions, heavy gameplay, and a significant learning curve.  In that context, the length of the rulebook becomes more acceptable to me, although the rules still feel a tad fiddlier than other games of its weight.  Learning the characteristics of the different person tiles is roughly analogous to learning the buildings in Puerto Rico, but the sequence of play is among the harder to grasp for modern Euros (it's not as complex as wargames like Hammer of the Scots or Crusader Rex, though).

The complexity doesn't bother me though.  The game play is rich, with measures of strategy, tactics, bluff and misdirection.  The bang for the complexity isn't as high as it is for the best Euros, but it is still quite high.

All of the bitching about the endgame shield-majority bonuses baffles me.  Yes, it is semi-random, but more important than the randomness is the fact that it helps to balance shield play against mission play, offering a few points compensation for the loss of special powers granted by completed missions.

A bigger issue for me is the Intrigue cards.  They play a pretty marginal role in the game, since they are only available via one personality tile, and a couple of missions.  I would be surprised if more than 4-5 appear in a given game.  Also, the "surprise influence" that they grant isn't as interesting as I expect from something that is so rare and exotic.  Perhaps they would be more fun if they offered one-time use special powers, although they would then have to be balanced carefully against each other. 

For such a complex game, player aids would have been a really nice addition to the package, though.  In fact there are several signs of production decisions made to fit the game into a particular price point rather than for quality, including smooth finishes for all cards and tiles rather than linen finish, cards that could have benefited from a move up to the next standard size, and thinner than expected (although still adequate) chits and tiles.  You get your money's worth, but a higher level of production (and the accompanying rise in price) would have been nice for a game of this weight.

Nice little majorities game. Some random elements, yet there is enough strategy to make play measurable. Close games with experienced players might be resolved in luck .....time will tell.

Update:

Another good play after a long hiatus results in the confirmation that this is a 7, but a strong one. If not for a luck based endgame it would likely be an 8.

I wouldn't play it with any variants as the game isn't long or heavy enough to warrant it, and experience really evens things out. I suppose you might lose by a point or two because of the chips, but most often you're going to lose by a goal card or two.

Intriguing card play leads to fun area control.  This is one of the more unique examples of the mechanic I've seen yet: walking from person to person, and manipulating the missions that give cool powers.  It's not ugly either; what I want from a Euro-style area control game.

Good area control game.  Works well with 2 players as well (and a dummy or two dummy players depending on variant used).  Random value of the sheilds at the end doesn't bother me.  Generally, luck doesn't drive the final result and if does, so what, the journey was fun.

My first Euro.  Love the components in this game.  Have played it much more frequently than the plays indicate (I never tracked them at first).  My wife and I enjoyed it a lot in the beginning, but now it seems a little stale compared to some other games we've since added to our collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
A very fiddly game (which is why a number of BGG members have made their own boards to manage all the pieces).

First few games can be challenging, but it seems that this quickly becomes addictive.

One reviewer said: "I’ve never played Wallenstein, but I see very little in common between Louis and Puerto Rico. If I were to compare Louis XIV with other games I would say it's like a mixture of El Grande and Wyatt Earp. Another game that has a similar feel is Mykerinos in which you are trying to get area majorities in order to get special powers and points. Mykerinos, however, is much simpler and lighter." Another review (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/652283/is-there-a-louis-xiv-lite-somewhere) compared it to Mykerinos, Blue Moon City, and Leonardo da Vinci (all games that we own but have yet to get to the table; therefore, consider playing all those before buying another game). Another commenter in the same forum suggested Palais Royale (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/38992/royal-palace).

Amazon reviewer said: "Not really a great game for kids of boardgaming novices, because it is moderately complex. However, this is a reasonably good game for an experienced gamer."

Although it can be played with 2, it's weight is 3.0 and it plays in 100 minutes!

Some negative criticism as a 2 player game and one that did not go over well with the wife: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/559828/louis-xiv-when-good-themes-go-bad

Amazon review said: Recommended for experienced gamers. Although the game's mechanics are fairly simple in practice, the game sounds very complex when the rules are explained and will likely intimidate players not familiar with European style games.

Quite interesting area control game, with cards and non-trivial highly interactive rules, yet no board. It's got a great weight-to-game time ratio clocking in around 90 minutes.

Our first game was a 2p affair, and we entirely neglected to use the imaginary third player (as specified in the rules). The game was enjoyable, but by the end of it I still didn't feel I understood the strategy. This will definitely require a few more plays.

The box insert for this is terrible; I wish Alea would do custom inserts, rather than use a generic insert that hardly fits anything in.

[Played 6 times] 
Tactical game or risk management, where imperfect information prevents too much "analysis-paralysis"; it has some luck involved, several choices available and a moderate playing time. 
It adds a twist on the classical area-majority system. 
I strongly dislike the rule assigning extra points when game ends in a totally random way.
The 2-player game is very dependent on luck once both players have some experience, as the real difference is made by the occasional lucky draw of the "Influence Cards" and/or by the system awarding extra VPs for blazons when game ends. I'm afraid this is the case with more players as well, but it's more difficult to notice at least!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Random "missions", random placement cards, random intrigue cards, random shields tokens, and a somewhat random and chaotic board without any strategic planning ability makes for a game that is just miserable for me.

If you're lucky and your mission cards line up with your placement cards and the placements you need in a turn line up with the the locations that don't require winning first place to get something, it can be easy to move your way toward winning.  However, there are just so many ways to be unlucky in this game, with the endgame shields being yet another way for things to go wrong, that it's just irritating to me.  Make all the grand plans you want, it doesn't matter.

Based on 1 play with 4 players.

"Wooden cubes majority" game with complex scoring and a good measure of resource management (money, two kinds of influence tokens, mission tokens etc.) tossed in. An intense middle-weight game in a new box format for Alea. I like this game very much. The theme, being indeed very Knizia-like (i.e. chromeless), is not that thin at all. Just look at the arrangement of the characters and their "payouts" and compare these to the roles they actually played at Louis' court. This game could turn out to be the ultimate majority game (in the same sense as Ra sometimes is considered the ultimate auction game). But that only repeated play will tell.

RATING: 6
Played 5-10 times. 

You really need to have a plan for how you want to teach the game, and you really should have player aids for everyone. In most games, I describe the pieces as I move through the sequence of play. Here, you need to explain the pieces first.

Once explained, this seems to be a good game. It is really quite simple, but it´s har do overview, and players can either get bogged down if they want to optimize, or feel a lack of control and a slightly rushed tempo.

Rated an 8 at first, but I lowered it to a 7 after more plays, and then to a 6 after 7 plays. The game takes us 75 mins with 4 players and not much AP, and that may be too long for this one.

Dorn. 2-4, best with 4 says BGG poll.

Fast playing area majority game.  A little bit fiddly just because you have to flip the tiles a lot.  Probably wouldn't have been as annoying if we had been playing on a cloth rather than plastic surface.  It surprised me how fast it went.  There wasn't as much of a feel of beginning middle end as many games.

Pas trop aimé le système de scoring (partie à 3, pas pu y jouer à 4 malheureusement, c'est peut être différent). A 3 chaque joueur à la place d'obtenir 2 objectifs par tour. Se rater lors d'un seul des 4 tours et c'est la défaite quasi assurée.

Only played this as the 2-player version so particularly interested to try it with more as I think that would add far more competition into it.

RATING: 7
The main focus of the game is an interesting worker placement/bidding mechanic that is different than any other game.  The worker management aspect is also intriguing.  There is a tradeoff because when you win a free benefit you lose your workers.  At times you may wish to have a minority of workers on a tile so that you can buy the benefit and get your workers back.  And yet, if you always do this, you will run out of money.  So, there is a balance to be had in doing this while at the same time working to block your opponents.

RATING: 7
Love the theme but I feel it doesn't explore the theme deep enough. It uses modular board but the board setup is fixed. It is kind of area influence, but not about controlling a land, it is about controlling the courts. Nice graphic. Feel a bit like Mykerinos and a bit like PoF (for secret missions). Rules are too difficult to learn and setup is too tedious for a small game like this. I accept this difficulty but I feel hard to teach this game to others. (*Area influence)

As of 07/22/15 I've played four-player six times, and three-player four times. I liked it, though I didn't know what I was doing most of the first game. The iconography is not that easy to fathom. So even after playing several times I have to always ask what some of them mean, how majority ties are resolved, who gets what, etc. As to the production itself there are *waaaaaaaay* too many things colored gold.

Very very very good game.  I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  The game mecanism is refreshingly new and the theme is well ported.  I must add that this game was blindly bought thanks to the personalized recommandation of the BGG database.  I am not disapointed by that feature.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a tense and interesting game with tough choices, nail-biting moments and a really great theme enhanced by (generally) nice components. Use your influence at court to gain favours which you can use to complete missions or buy marks of heraldry. The king visits different royals (for which there is an important spatial aspect) and gives bonuses. The results of the reward round change by flipping the various personages when their benefits are claimed. 

This is a clever game where the influence phase plays similarly to the Market phase in Hermagor (which is by far the most interesting bit of that game.) Louis XIV goes further, however - I love the way the successful bidder is penalised by having his courtiers sent back to the country (general stock). I mark it down, however, for its slightly annoying card mechanic that determines where you can start playing influence. This isn't too much of a problem. 

I do not, however, think much of the random shield grab when you win heraldry tokens, nor the silly bonus tokens for those who've randomly picked up the most of one heraldic emblem over another. Eclipse re-implements this in a more elegant form with the tile draws for combat etc. (though it's still annoying in that game). But for the end game randomness, this would be a point higher.

Maybe I should try Five Tribes as I like the workers-on-a-path mechanism so much.

New in collection april 07.
Initial rating after first 2 plays with 2: After getting through the rulebook it plays a lot easier than expected. Second play went a lot faster than 100 minutes. Probably quite playable in 30/40 minutes once you know all the card effects.
Before I discovered BGG I used to think it's a fun game to play with 2, now I just think it's a boring abstract. Maybe I should try this with 3 before I get rid of it. It probably gets too random /chaotic with 4 I presume.

Update: sold it.

I thought is game was OK.  Basically, you have to decide which action is worth the most victory points.  Your actions are limited by the cards you got at the start of the round.  All things being equal, I thought the luck of the draw of cards was the most important factor in this game.

I like this game quite a bit. One of the best area control games. I think I dreamt about it last night.

I thought the game was pretty tense. It was fun and lasted the right amount of time, IMHO. I was defending against the red I cards the whole game and when I relaxed, I finally got hit by one in the last round. The ability to draw an extra green card each round is massive. We all took a bit of time on our turn to consider our options. There's multiple paths to victory for sure. More tactical than strategic, as you have to go with what missions and abilities you draw.

Area-control type game with several different paths to victory (and several different way to 'screw thy neighbour'). Better theme than most games of its genre.

Played twice with three people.  This is a very complex area influence game that took a good bit of explaining and a few turns of play to pick up (the game comes with no player cheat sheets; they would be insanely helpful).  The heart of the game is placing influence markers on various locations on the board; the person with the most influence markers on any given location gets some reward (which will help them fulfill missions, get victory shields, or get money); however, being first is not always good, as the person with the most markers on a location loses all those influence markers.  There appear to be many possible paths to victory; the high player interaction (competing for locations on the board), very limited resources, and limited number of turns makes the game very thought-heavy.  Very, very fun, but not a game for novice gamers.

After another annoying game of this last night, I find myself still thinking about it today. There's more strategy than I initially thought, as you really have to consider the flipping of tiles from round to round; anyone who tries too hard in the first round will get burned in the second. Once someone gets a leg up on the missions, the game is essentially over, as they not only have the lead but also additional benefits that help them extend that lead. My girlfriend enjoys it, so I guess I'll be forced to play it more. Hopefully something more compelling than "don't win too much in the first round" will emerge as a strategy.

UPDATE: After not playing this for over two years, I was able to get rid of it. I guess she didn't like it so much after all!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A very tight, tense game blending area majority + worker placement -- you need the placements to earn resources to complete missions, but often only the person with the majority gets the resource. The board consisting of flippable tiles is an interesting twist, but I haven't played it enough to see if it significantly affects the strategy....

"Order out of Chaos" . . . should be the other sub-title of this game.  After reading the rules, I was still scratching my head as to what I was actually doing or respresenting in this very abstract game of political intrigue.  Finally, after playing a few games, I have a much better understanding AND enjoyment of the game.  What appears on its face as a some-what chaotic (the "board" or grouping of cards, the varied places for the pieces, the seemingly abstract missions, etc.) game is really an area control via networking game.  Once you understand this (and the basic four phases of the game) it plays rather quickly and can lead to some agonizing decisions during its course.  The combination of theme and play is not as tight as Puerto Rico, but then again it is not as abstract of China or Web of Power (although its is definately more "fiddly" than those two . . . whatever that means).  My only advice is that you don't make up your mind based on only a couple of plays--it takes a few plays to get the feel and fun of this game.

In the court of Louis the XIV all manner of individuals are continually jockeying for influence and favour with the many nobles that reside there. 

Offering an area control mechanism of sorts, each noble offers a different benefit. The the aim is to earn the most victory points by completing missions and collecting heralds. Louis is a classic Euro game that plays in just over 1 hour. For the depth of play and time frame that it delivers, Louis is in  my top 5 Euro list.

I don't think I've ever played a game where I've had to refer to the rules as often as Louis XIV. What does that tile give you again? When is it flipped? What does the second player get? What does the tied player get? Where do the influence markers go afterwards? How does the presence of Louis XIV change all this? Never has a player aid been more warranted than here!

That said, Louis XIV does offer plenty of literal intrigues. How should I use my cards to optimally spread my influence? Which favors are most desirable for my short term and long term objectives? What are the other players up to and how should I best cross/avoid them? Yes, there is a randomness from the card drawing but it's you who decides how best to play your cards given the circumstances at the court. The theme of court intrigues at the Sun King's court is not far fetched at all.

Placing pawns on the table is the part with the most strategic elements and tensions, it's just that the scoring scheme falls flat, as most of the time players completed the same amount of mission cards, leaving the coat-of-arms chits as tiebreaker, which is somewhat luck-based.

RATING: 9
After seeing a player win who got screwed out of the crowns and mission card race, change course mid-game and go for the coats of arms, I am upgrading to a 10.  Wow!!  Started this off as an 8 after three plays...but now upgrading for sure after many more plays, like I suspected.  This game is extremely well balanced and fun to play.  Good challenging choices and just the right mix of player "chaos" and skill and only a minimal amount of luck from the coat of arms and card draw.  Excellent theme in the Sun King Court.  All of our games have been close and exciting.  This is a true keeper after all!! Playing even more as Louis keeps bringing me back even into 2007 recently.

Area influence game based on 17th century France.  There are 12 figures represented by 12 boards. Move your pawns onto these boards to achieve majorities or have a presence to earn tokens. Tokens allow you to fulfill missions, worth 5 VPs each. Other boards let you get accumulate other chips, worth 1 VP each. It's been an engaging game with 2,3 or 4 players. Plan to spend two hours playing this game.

Abstract ahoy! A very clever (almost too clever for its own good at times) game that I enjoy very much. Dangerously close to being too fiddly for its own good...The rules booklet is a pain and I have encountered many players who almost refuse to play it a second time after trying it out as it can seem rather confusing at first. There's perhaps a bit too much going on with the abundance of favours cards. Works well with two-players (modified rules: two dummy players)

Begrudgingly raised from a 6 to a 7.  After getting over the disappointment brought on by preconceptions, this is both a good game and a fun game.  I think it's relatively light masquerading as a mid-heavy, and I still don't care for the scoring (I don't mind the shields, but I'd like a finer grain than there is overall) but once you accept those the resource management and problem solving is enjoyable.

Tough game in the court of the Sun King. The mechanics of the area control works beautifully. AP is possibly an issue here, but it doesn't matter too much.

In Alea Treasure Chest is a small expansion for Louis XIV, The Favorite. It changes the play a little bit, and maybe balances some issues with luck. I found it quite useful.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
20 plays or so, and this game has hit its plateau.  There's a ton of chrome and just enough choice to make your decisions a little painful.  There's better area-control games, but I haven't seen one this good in this price range.  Also, I really like this game as a 2-player with two ghosts.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Card driven tactical majority game, where majorities earn resources, that are used to buy cards which bring special abilities and victory points. It has become a little bit samey after repeated play, and luck unfortunately plays a pretty significant role. The game can be enjoyable if played fast as a light game should be played, but if it is overanalysed and runs to 2 hours, than it becomes intolerably boring.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Good resource management game. You must choose which favors you want to win. If you try to spread yourself out too much, you'll be stuck later on. It's important to fulfill as many missions as you can, since they will give you more victory points than most other options.

RATING: N/A
The graphic design makes the game feel old.

But overall, I enjoy the gameplay. Nonetheless, I think it's too thinky, and there's a lot of time between turns. 

This game would be ideal if it could be finished under 1 hour. Otherwise, I have the feeling we do too few things in so much time.

RATING: 7
Played two games with 4 players. I'm not sure how much there is luck involved. There are couple chaotic elements (shields and more importantly the fact you can't tell what missions others are aiming for) that might in the end decide the winner. Playing is fun and rewarding. More games might push the rating up.

Decent area influence game. There are a number of fiddly rules to learn and remember, but some nice interactive mechanics and tough decisions each turn makes it an enjoyable game. The theme is rather tacked on and I wonder if this originally had a science fiction theme. (8)

A bit underwhelmed by this at first, but I'm willing to give it chance. The rules booklet is a hard slog, and actually there's much less game underneath than this would suggest. Poor card draws can make or break you too and don't even get me started on the suggested scoring of the coats of arms. I really don't feel there should be this much randomness in a game that's aiming to be lean and tight.

El Grande's evil twin: fiddly, inelegant, area majority that only plays well with 4 players.  Also evil for the sheer viciousness of the game, and the fact that you lose all of your area influence after each round.  However, evil doesn't necessarily mean bad, and this is an excellent twist on area control for when more interplayer screwage is wanted then El Grande has to offer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I think this game is pretty good, but I wouldn't buy this for myself. It's not as easy to teach as it should be. I've played this game with multiple people, and every one of them has to look back at the rules to see how ties are resolved.

This should not happen for this game. In El Grande, for example, it is very simple to explain what happens on ties: no one gets the points for that place; the tied players get the points for the next scoring position down. Louis XIV should have been as simple to explain.

Played this once and really didn't rate it - hence its never seen the light of day again. Having read some of the reviews here on the geek, I'm going to have to try and convince myself its worth another shot...

I've really grown to love this game. There are a lot of choices to make and I love the theme. I don't really mind the end game scoring, and it plays great with 2-4. Also, for an area-control game, it has about the right play time.

Update: I've downgraded it to 8. I think this game is TOO balanced. It's almost impossible to cream someone, even a newbie.

A great medium weight game for 2-players. Very simple to play and a concise rulebook to follow. This one has sat on our shelf for awhile, but after rereading the rules I remembered what a good game it was and am playing it again. It's one that will probably come out as a week night game because of it's length of play. It provides a unique gaming experience that really is unlike any other game. 

The expansion that comes with the Alea Treasure Box is interesting, but really doesn't enhance game play for 2-players very much. I do enjoy the perks that come from the favored adviser character though...providing another way to retrieve influence markers.

Definitely one of my favorite games of all time. The components (simple wooden "influence" tokens, cardboard squares and teeny, tiny cards) are limited but I believe they add to the charm of this simple but elegant game. Player's turns are swift and cut down on AP. The game is thematic, always a delight to play and one of my favorite games to gamers ready for heavier games than Catan and Ticket to Ride.

A great game with fantastic presentation and very good mechanics! My top game in majority area control! It's also great to introduce newbies into more complex gameplays. The historic setting is simply genius and actually manages coherently combine the theme and the gameplay! Simply fantastic stuff!

Played this game again after a very long time and I still love it. I feel actually great affection to it. I think this game is the one that made me fall in love with board games. I had only a very small "collection" of maybe two or three games by then, and as I got this I was showered by a feeling of magic! Opening this beautiful little box and discovering all the bits and pieces! The originality of not having any board to play on but only these absolutely gorgeous character tiles!

You can tell that a lot of love went into this one! I understand the importance of Goa in terms of a gamers game statement, but to me, this is his opus magna, everything from concept to design is simply breathtaking, and the game still manages to create tension among players!

I LOVE IT!

Weird game. I had fun all the five or six times I played, but never managed to shake off the feeling that I didn't get it. When I sit down to play, it seems Louis XIV just 'happens', without me knowing exactly how. I am left with a nice feeling afterwards, so that can't be bad, right?

RATING: 6
Heard good things, but a little disappointed on first play. The playing for influence system is great, but the end scoring using random pulls from the 'shield' bag is a weak victory element that doesn't belong in a strategy title. Maybe it's because we only played two player. I can see this being much better with 3 or 4 players. Initial rating was 7, but now dropped to 6 because I (and my wife) never think about bringing it to the table for a second go. Finicky setup time detracts, and she found it a bit boring to just be placing influence bits around the little boards. It's very dry. Historically accurate, but so is the discovery of knitting. Will consider giving it another chance using variant of 2 additional dummy players, one for each player. But with so many new games we have not played, can't see getting around to this one again for as while, unless we get more players.

Un gioiellino. Il campo di battaglia è una corte del Re, per cui non troverai morti ammazzati. L'orticello però è troppo piccolo e i coltelli, seppur metaforici, volano lo stesso. Questo è Louis XIV: un gestionale dove più che fare il tuo devi rompere uova negli altrui panieri. Come gli scacchi, le regole sono semplici, le strategie complessissime. Mi piace la meccanica di gioco d-i-a-b-o-l-i-c-a, l'interazione pesante tra i giocatori che ne consegue e quei ribaltamenti di fronte che, ahimé, ho sperimentato sulla pelle nella partita inaugurale. Tutto serve nella stessa misura. Anche i soldi fanno brodo nella conquista della vittoria. Unica perplessità: il fattore-culo non è indifferente, sia nella scelta delle carte influenza che nei benefit delle missioni concluse. Poi, una considerazione di meta-gioco. C'è un aspetto di Louis XIV (ma forse sarebbe più corretto dire "c'è un atteggiamento nei riguardi dei giocatori") che mi ha particolarmente colpito: le regole dicono che è possibile chiedere favori ai personaggi adiacenti a quelli che hai in mano. Un Reiner Knizia si sarebbe fermato qui: le regole stabiliscono questo, punto. L'autore invece giustifica questa possibilità: le "adiacenze" (e la possibilità di sfruttarle) ci sono perché rappresentano la rete di relazioni che i membri della corte intessevano tra di loro (mi piace pensare che ci sia stata anche una ricerca storica in tal senso). E io, che prediligo il non astratto e che temo gli astratti mascherati da giochi a tema, non posso che apprezzare lo sforzo nel mettere il sistema di regole a servizio dell'ambientazione.

Excellent! Tense and plays quickly. The limit of 4 turns make this game a little more strategic than it already is. The only luck part is in the draw of the influence cards. That can really affect whatever plans a player may have but it also makes a player think carefully on how they would play their cards to get the maximum effect. Another thing that I like about this game is how one player's decision directly affects another in terms of placing influence counters. Sometimes I am forced to change my strategy in order to combat the ones placed by another player. I would have to consider if wasting so much influence for a counter is worth it as any player who wins a chamber loses their influence counters to the general store. The mapboard is somewhat refreshing as well, making all its pieces squeezable into a small and compact box. Excellent game IMO.

I wanted to love this game, and I gave it a lot of tries. I was hoping it would be a travelable version of Goa, with more theme.  But it mostly disappoints.  

In the first place, it feels just a little too easy to complete the missions, giving the game a loose feel.  If it were harder to complete the missions this game would be something.  

Second, the game seems entirely tactical.  You get some cards, and you try to figure out how to fulfill them, [i]in one round[/i].  There is none of the lovely game-long strategic planning that makes Goa so good. Should I trade it? Maybe I should play it one or two more times to be sure. [traded for Katzenjammer Blues.]

Cool and compact majority game with neat special powers.  Possibly a bit too dependent on influence card draw but the extent remains to be seen.  We like to play with a 'draw two, keep one' variant for each coat-of-arms won or purchased to make it a bit less random.

An ingenious little area control game, with variable area control rules, all bound together with a spatial element.  The mechanics in this game are very clever, and the gameplay is very tight.  I really like how it's not always best to try to win things outright, because you are often better off trying to come in second to preserve your influence tokens.  On the other hand, having a boatload of tokens at the end of the game does you no good, so it's a balancing act.

12/20 Tried to break this out for a solitare play a few times, and have not been able to complete the task. Interesting (and weird) setup, where you kind of design the board on the table with the pieces. 8/06: Setup is a major pain in the butt, and it annoys me that the pieces slide all over. This one may never make it to the table.

TRY Dec/05 (3-player): Good game, but I'm having a tough time rating it, or deciding how frequently I'd enjoy it.  Had an El Grande feel, to the area majority battles, and the caballeros in your court vs. provinces.  Had fiddly parts, with having to remember to flip over the tiles after a clear winner.  Had some good, bloody battling by round 4 (reminiscent of 5-player Puerto Rico) -- I imagine a 4-player game could be downright NASTY, full of tight challenges and screwage.  Good theming to gameplay, in my mind.

It is heavyweight, but still enjoyable, even on a first play.

Update: It just doesn't click with me anymore. I can´t really decide wheter I think it´s challanging or trivial. There is no motivation as a player - who am "I" and what do "I" need to do. I don't mind "thin" themes, but this one doesn't work. It's neat, it's elegant and I like the presentation, but that's not enough.

I can't play it with my "almost gamer" friends where the beer - and the quality of the beer - are just as crucial as the game. (They like Imperial, Power Grid for example).

My wife thinks it's slightly boring.

My gamer friends have little interest in this one. I might as well trade it away.

***

A fairly complex game to learn from the rulebook but with a light feel to it. I don't know why, but grasped games like Puerto Rico, Power Grid and Imperial much faster. My wife picked up this quickly though, thinking it was much easier than Notre Dame. 

But I like it, very much. It's a quiet, pleasant and elegant game with lots of replay value and with the possibility to do some nasty tactical moves. My only complaint is that it has a distant feel to it. The game have really nice components and all, but when playing I feel I'm doing something arbitary rather than trying to influence people in the court of the king. But I like it just the same.

I play 2-player games with the variant with two virtual players (8/4 wooden pieces).

Got actually two years after getting this game to play this. It was just as good as I expected of an euro game. A bit chaotic but fun to play, though I think only for four players.

Sometimes the setting is annoyingly random, when there are 2-3 other players after your final move. Luck is strongly present in this game although it's not too random.

Definitely would play again, hopefully soon.

Initially it all looked very confusing (don't they all?) but after a handful of plays the gameplay has emerged and it's very enjoyable. Try and influence, pander or bribe your way around the court of the King while outdoing your fellow courtiers, do you shower them with gold or hang around their knees whispering how lovely they are? Lots to think about, very tight counter placement where one slip can mess you up but with various ways to make up for the cock-up. Girlfriend likes this one so a solid 9.

This is a better game than I think people might guess.  The vying for influence is very themey, the choices are interesting, but I don't feel weighed down by the decisions.  It's a good weight for the length of time to play.  And the cards add interesting goals and bonuses.

Demoed this at GenCon.  The way we were taught, the game features random opportunities to achieve random/hidden/unpredictable short-term goals and win unpredictable shields for a partially randomized victory.  Not knowing the short-term goals of the other players made predicting their moves almost irrelevant.  The theming was also irrelevant, although I wanted to like it.

My views on this have evolved a bit.  It's a pretty well-balanced game that is actually fairly straightforward to those familiar with basic area control mechanics.  I do think it'd be cool to plan your mission cards, but those do seem pretty well-balanced.  A slick, clever game with lots of tough choices and plenty of opportunity for key, tactical decision making.  And it's pretty.

The time crunch in this game is both excruciatng and exhilarating.  There is always more that you want to do than you have time for, learning where to cut and run and where to stick around can make or break your strategy.  I really enjoy this game with more players, as that forces even more difficult decisions.  The game may have a propensity towards AP, but it's only 4 turns in length, which helps keep the game moving.

What a pleasant suprise! All those fiddly bits, little rules and overall randomness, and yet Louis XIV is a deep, strategic game. There's a ton of interaction and chaos, but it's manageable. 

Managing is what you're doing a lot. You manage cards, cubes, money and tokens, but also risk, competition, position and options. Do I wait, push forward, fight, bluff, invest, spread out? It's your choice how much risk you want to take, how much you want to fight your opponents, how much you want to work towards future turns.

When playing Louis XIV, you have to work with the resources you randomly get and you must react to what the other players do. Much chaos, little control. On the other hand, the game rewards planning, and you can do a lot to increase your future options.

Little control, lots of decisions. :thumbsup:

This is a strategy game by Rudiger Dorn (Goa, Traders of Genoa, Jambo). It is fundamentally an area influence/control game, although the `areas' are actually the nobility figures surrounding the Sun King. A game of great design with some original elements and highly engaging game play. For me the primary negative is the Intrigue cards. They really hurt this nice game by introducing a random "take-that" element. Minus one star for the Intrigue cards (from 8 to 7).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Only played with 2, which is okay. The dummy player still leaves the board a bit too open and exploitable. Dorn's design is clearly seen in the adjacency of influence marker placement. The shield randomness hasn't bothered me, as it never seemed to have much effect. The game is really about who completes the most missions, which is almost too straightforward. Wish there was a little more strategic variety. Flows well though, and finishes fast.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
3 plays.  It's how Dorn does fiddly.  Heavy, and not the easiest game to explain.  A ton of game there, though.  Quite a bit of fun once you get the hang of it.  Sadly too heavy for light gaming, and not quite as good as some of the heavy games.

The horrendous rulebook delayed my enjoyment of this game for some time. Then someone taught the game to me. The rulebook really should be scrapped and rewritten. The game isn't that convoluted at all. I first thought 'good game'; however, upon subsequent plays this area majority game reveals its true genius. Brilliant design, great scalability (I have really enjoyed playing with 2 and 4), and nail-biting tension. Truly deserves to be played by everyone who calls themselves a euro-gamer. Rating has jumped from 8 to 9 after 4 plays and will probably stay there for quite a long time. Positives: Great design, interesting presentation, very tense throughout. Negatives: Possible luck issue depending on cards drawn, otherwise nothing.

RATING: 5
This is a perfectly fine game, where on your turn you drop 1-3 markers in a mancala sort of path along a series of 1-3 tiles. The card you play dictates where in the grid you can start your path from. Once everyone is done playing cards, the tiles are evalutates for mosties. The person with the most gets a discount, or maybe does the thing alone, and then if possible, other players pay for the same effect. The goal of the game is points, which come from picking up flag tokens and completing quest cards, which all want certain things, and all have neat powers that give you a vague sense that you are building an engine. Again, the game is fine, it's just that the little engine you create isn't that satisfying, and there is a lot of chaos, so going early in play order is a pretty large disadvantage. This is by no means game breaking as turn order passes each of the 4 rounds, but it does cause a certain lack of caring. This is a competently designed game that's just not that much fun.

Louis XIV is further evidence that I don't really get on with Rudiger Dorn's intricate Faberge egg creations. The central mechanism of card-driven influence placement with 'spreading' is fine. It gives a good balance of constraint and flexibility. But what you do with the influence seems unnecessarily complicated, with at least one subsystem too many.

Holy crap!!! Can the rules for this be any more contrived?!? Finally slogged through the rules and found an excellent game. Lots of good choices and not enough resources to complete all of your plans. Some really great decisions to be made. I enjoyed this game alot. It has really nice components. Dorn is an excellent game designer. This game is very very fiddly though. Sadly the game seems to end just as it is getting interesting.

Raised rating a bit. I like this game more and more each time I play it. Just a brilliant design. Beautiful to look at as well.

The components are outstanding. The use of historical portraits of the various personages you are trying to influence well evokes the theme. 
Even they type of rewards are reflective of the personalities on the card.
Like the multi-tier approach - area majority using one set of resources, to gather other resources (rewards) to accomplish the VP collection (missions). The coat of arms does provide some balance - if you start getting locked out of missions.
Feel that is plays best with 4.

Good méchanic but not fluid. Not the type of game to initiate a non player. Must be played several time to be mastered. The coats of arms do not provide enough VP in a two player game, thus cannot be considered a good victory strategie. Remain a good strategic game. The rules are hard to understand at the first reed.

Bonne mécanique mais pas fluide. Ce n'est pas le genre de jeux pour initier des non joueurs. Doit être joué souvent avant de pouvoir le maîtriser. Les armoiries ne donnent pas assez de PV dans une partie à deux joueurs pour être considérées comme une stratégie viable. Demeure tout de même un bon jeux stratégique. Les règles sont difficles à comprendre à la première lecture.

This game does have a handful of brilliant mechanics but unfortunately it adds a handful of more to the mix and bloats and otherwise great experience. The placement rules and trouble of getting your little cylinders back is lots of fun, simple to learn but hard to master. Yet, all the other things, the double sided tiles and especially (!) the abilities of the mission and various power tiles you need just make the game unnecessary complex and add more fiddlyness without making the game more compelling. I think this could have been a lighter but better game and as it stands it does not strike the right balance between playability and weight, because it carries a lot of excess baggage that just weighs it down.

The meat of the game, the card play, is very fun and compelling and I love the variable powers provided by the mission cards.  Much better to play with player familiar to the game as it keeps the down time down.

This game has a big fiddle factor in the set up.  It also has a big fiddle factor in the supply and scoring phases.  I also think they skimped a little too much on card quality.  The cards are beautiful but too small.

Overall a great game with some fiddle and production value issues.

Another Euro game that is enjoyable but is too short to get a true sense of long term strategy.  it is another drag race to the finish kind of game.  The components are nice, but all look too simlar.  There is no board which makes it a little more difficult to deal with in playing.  Overall though an acceptable experience.  

After a second playing, way to short.  You just get started and the game is over.

Won my first game of this in May of 06.  It is one of Ted's favorites.  So I have played it now a number of times.  I am learning the strategy, but think the game is not deep enough for my tastes.  The cards that are used in the game now make sense to me.  A board is not needed.

Yet another area influence game. The actual area influencing was very enjoyable. It's everything aroung that part that I don't like. Way too many cards with special powers, way too much *luck*, and way too much bookkeeping!

This game is very well done.  Lots of strategic manipulation required for success.  Quality production and very original concepts.  You find yourself pouring over your options, having 10 things you want to do and only being able to accomplish a couple of them.  There's a bit of luck in this game as well, but it doesn't detract from it's strategy as luck factors seem to do in most games. I'd highly recommend this one.

Every once in a while it's good to play an old classic that you've never played before. Sometimes, it's disappointing. I was a little disappointed by Caylus on my first play because I felt like other games did the worker placement better. Perhaps if I'd played Caylus before playing those other games, I'd have fallen in love with it. But with Louis XIV, I didn't feel any disappointment. It felt fresh and unique, and the card mechanic meshed really well with the majority control mechanic, and the way the tiles flip for variety was also very neat. Louis XIV is a tense, exciting game with tons of player interaction.  It's heavy without inducing migraines, and the interaction introduces a sense of lightness as does the randomness of the card play.

Louis XIV plays like Royal Palace wants to play.  There's always something to think about and there is good reason to be engaged while the other players take their turns.  What each player does will probably affect you.  The only other euros I've played with this level of interaction have had auction mechanics.

This game is great--it has all the elements that I like in a game.  The shield mechanic at the end is admittedly too random for such an otherwise tight game.

RATING: 5
Based on one play.  It's clever, but I can't say I enjoyed it that much. A lot of it has to do with the number of rules (quite a lot for a 45-min game) and the special ability cards (I rarely like special abilities--it's too difficult to remember who can do what, and how to react to to other people). 

My biggest complaint, however, is that it is impossible to predict the actions of your fellow players.  The 'goals' of each player are hidden, and almost no information is available to help you glean this information (until it's too late anyways).  So strike one for being a game where you can't sense, even a little bit, what your opponent wants at times when it matters.  Second, your opponents' choices of moves depend on the special abilities that they have (too many to keep track of) and the courtier cards in their hands (very luck driven and impossible to determine at all based on prior actions of the player). So strike two for not having any sense of each player's future movement capabilities.  Therefore, you sort of play solitaire, without consideration of other people's future moves. Yes there's interaction between people, in a sense, but nothing more meaningful than rubbing up against strangers in a crowded subway.  Not my sort of game.

RATING: 5
This looks like an El grande card game, but heavier on the action cards, and keeping actions cards for further rounds to benefit you. Not much in screwage except placing more influence markers in areas. Looks like it will be a fun game for 3-4; an imaginary 3rd player in the 2-player version might be disheartening since it is rather random, and you have to play against it. have to play with what you have, should prove interesting, but I feel 3-4 will play better.

First play was a tense, interesting tussle with four players and only 4 points separating everyone at the end.  Game also plays relatively quickly, so gives a good value for decision complexity in a small time frame.  As other comments point out, it is "area majority" to gain items that can be combined to gain victory points.  Multiple ways to go achieve that goal (multiple areas to control) as players act and react to each other's moves.

I love area control games, and this one seemed ok at the start.  As the game went on, one player jumped out ahead, and there seemed to be little we could do.

what a disappointment (considering the formerly high Alea standard). Artificial theme, confusing "board" (should have been a proper and better laid out board, IMHO), random missions with unbalanced powers (my major criticism).

An extraordinarily elegant game, with interesting decisions all over the place.  Playing feels like balancing half a dozen see-saws at once, but the play itself is smooth and sensible.  There are tactics, strategy and psychology all in abundance, and though there is more luck than you might expect in a game like this, it doesn't bother me nearly as much here as it does in, say, T&E or Settlers.  And to top it off, the game (for me) just plain looks nice.

RATING: 8
Interesting game play.  Dorn loves to work his movement scheme into everything and it works here too.  Too many difficult decisions at times are required.  Played 3 player only at this time, it still does exhibit the typical 3 player problem (2 people lock horns, 1 gets to snag a lead in the slack).  Not as difficult to teach/understand as others have indicated.

This game is a lot of fun - the only drawback is that it maxes out at 4 players when I almost always have 5 or 6 people in my gaming group, so I don't get to play it as much as I would like to.

This game incorporates strategy that makes you think on the fly.  Where your opponents place their "influence" can make it all but impossible to carry out your plan that you had at the beginning of the round to complete your missions.  This game is intense.  Sure, there is a bit of analysis paralysis at times from some people, but it's hard not to think hard and give it your best effort - after all, your are trying to influence the Sun King!

Great Area Influence Game. Each round, players have a hand of 5 cards, each depicting 1 of the "Boards". Influence Markers can be placed only on these cards (you play 1 card per turn and put 3 markers on that card). You can then move your markers, but must always leave one behind. All 5 cards aren't used though, you only use 4 and discard the last one. Each "Board" Gives you a Bonus, like a certain counter, or card, or money. The basis of VP's is your trying to complete Mission cards that say "X Counter and X Counter" where X is one of the Counters that 1 of the "Boards" is offering. Also, Mission cards have a special text power that give you some sort of bonus when you have completed it. A very diverse Game that is tense and fun. Also, I love the Theme and Components.

Players represent cortisans in French Court trying to gain prestige out of influence over different historical characters, as it has been seen before on [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/21632]Um Krone und Kragen[/url][/i] and [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/27162]Kingsburg[/url][/i].  Nevertheless, this time dice aren't the heart around it.  Instead, area control is the main mechanic, leading us to a game similar to [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/21882]Blue Moon City[/url][/i], cause in both players leave pawns around a flipping board made of tiles in order to gain control of them to get prices that later will become victory points.

Goa and Istanbul are both great games. Louis XIV is from the same designer, and also quite good, but not quite as good. 

There is a choice to either put out influence, or get more influence to put out later, which is a good decision. And making the trails of influence is intriguing and, not surprisingly, seems related to those other Rüdiger Dorn games I have played. And the interaction between players has the potential to be fairly direct, which can be fun.

In all, it's a good combination of choices and rules that fit well together. It's dry and mechanical and thinky, which is what I enjoy.

Rudiger Dorn is SUCH a solid designer. This game has some great mechanics and I like the fact that there's long-term planning with the missions, but you've also got influence cards that only let you go in certain areas. I can see this one rising as I become more familiar with it. Fun.

A really tight area control game.  The game is much simpler than I thought it was when I was learning it.  But simpler doesn't mean easy.  Really it comes down to making the best use of your markers to control areas on the board which give varying prizes.  But there is a lot of strategy in choosing which cards to play and when.  I'm expecting that my rating will go up as I play it more.

Another area control game with neat mechanics.  I love how sometimes you can just bribe the court members for the items you need but other times you need to be their favorite to get them.  It's very true to the game's theme.  I also think the different levels of mission cards with different bonus values is pure genius.  Finally, I like the shield points at the end of the game.  It is a bit random, but it forces you to play that side of the game as well.  I like this one a lot.

Clever area majority system that is too well-balanced for its own good.
Far too loose with three players, slightly too tight with four, it ends up coming down to card draws (not the Mission cards, but the Influence cards.)  This doesn't stop it being a fun experience, but not my cup of tea.

RATING: 7
A clockwork game with lots of intricate moving parts that tick along procedurally.  In actual play, it rolls a little better than you would think from reading the incredibly turgid rules.  My favorite part, the powers on the mission cards, seems to develop too slowly and does not [i]feel[/i] strongly part of the game itself.  I do worry that it is too easy for everyone to finish the same number of missions, making play all about the shields.  The biggest sin is that the theme is not followed through - the influence markers should be "courtiers" and everything (especially the missions) should be more descriptive.

Louis XIV -- Played four-player.  In most regards, the rulebook is well done -- concise where possible, examples where necessary (illustrated and explained).  However, certain key elements which should be highlighted are hidden amongst unbolded text (e.g.: the fact that crown tiles are wild is stated clearly, but it's buried amongst a surfeit of other details.).  There are many (many!) such details to learn, requiring a very thorough reading of the rulebook.  That said, once you know the rules they're intuitive and easy to remember.  

And worth it.  The game system is innovative.  The decisions are tough.  Will your Influence cards allow you to reach the personage you want with enough tokens to get a reward?  Should you try to get the specific chips on your mission cards?  Or crown chips?  A mix?  

I find myself wondering if mission cards aren't worth a bit too much.  My only real complaint is that the two cards which let you draw additional mission cards are in the light stack, when their value clearly warrants the dark stack.  An even more minor issue:  I wish the coat-of-arms tiles were shaped like shields rather than squares, but the overall aesthetic is consistent and pleasing.

I've created a board to facilitate the placement of the placards and the associated tokens. (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/251729)

Rating after first learning game. Resource management and bit of area control game that felt a bit similar to Blue Moon City (which is more streamlined, has less resources and overall will be better for more causal gamers) and to Notre Dame (with added crisis management and card drafting, which might be better suited for more regular gamers, but with simpler area control). At first it looks a bit intimidating (from the complexity point of view), but all things are quite intuitive once the game starts.

RATING: 7
Has many good qualities, and is an enjoyable game. Unlike Goa, the fine balance is not totally wrecked by the wild swings of the tacked-on luck elements, although the tacked-on luck elements do seem superfluous. Some fixes on this site have already address this issue.

The game lacks elegance. Missions are 5 points each, shields are 1 point each, and nothing else matters. Too many cards are unbalanced, and too many things don't matter in the first or last round. All the leftovers are traded for shields at the end of the game, which just feels like poor design work.

Plays well with two players.

RATING: 7
Played 1 3P game. The game has a number of interesting and agonising tactical decisions. We hammered in a game under an hour, which is far below the ominous 75-100 minutes estimated playtime on the box. 

The 'drifting influence' mechanism is neat, and the potential for the majority requirements on each tile to change from round to round keeps things fresh. What I'm wary about is that despite the tactical skills required in playing influence cards, the scoring is disproportionately random. The way the coat of arms are scored, in particular, is a bit unsatisfactory. I will probably have to get a few more games in to justify this ranking.

Quite enjoyable gameplay but I found that despite starting out quite well, by the end of round three I had essentially zero chance of winning, along with another player - it was between the two leaders. Neither of the losers had played atrociously, a combination of inexperience and bad cards had led to this situation. Since there was another entire round to play, this was a bit of a waste and is a fatal flaw of this game (and any with successive 'rounds' of VP allocation). The game became pointless 75% of the way through. Would play again, but I feel the design and balance are flawed.

The cards determining whom and where you can start and build your influence. It's all very unique and fresh and invites much competition.  ARGH! Love it!  I am a huge fan of Dorn's games.

I have a great appreciation of Herr Dorn's designs - I really like their symmetry and the layout and generally the little extra touches.  That was the thing that struck me first about Traders of Genoa and it struck me again with Louis XIV.  The game play here is straightforward but the possible strategies are diverse and the things that can go wrong are many.  Resource management is a fine art here.  Over-paying for things is bad but not paying enough and getting shut out of a reward is also very bad.  The balance is precarious and it makes for an interesting game that I am looking forward to playing a lot of in the next few months.

RATING: 5
I like area influence games (and I see no reason why a game has to be *completely* original), but I don't like Louis as much as many of the others (like El Grande).  I think the problem is that with Louis it is difficult or impossible to know what the others players want or what their capabilities are due to all the hidden information.  This takes away a lot of the fun strategy.

RATING: N/A
This game does not have the simplicity and elegance of rules typically found in German games. Gameplay is slightly reminiscent of that of El Grande involving control of certain personalities (much akin to areas) and gathering resources to fulfil objectives to score. There is adequate strategic depth for repeated plays.

Jó mechanizmusok, szép kártyák, jó játékmenet, ami szerintem a pontozással el lett rontva. A játékosok XIV. Lajos udvarában különböző nemesek kegyeit keresik, akik elsőségért vagy némi pénzért ajándékokkal jutalmazzák a játékosokat. Ezekkel különböző előnyöket lehet szerezni, illetve a négy fontos jelőlőfajtát begyűjteni, amikkel küldetéseket lehet megoldani. Ötletes a nemesek különböző ajándékai és elhelyezkedésük, jó a befolyásszerzés menete. Jók a küldetéskártyák különböző plusztulajdonságai. Ez egy nagyon jó kis játék lehetne, ha a pontozása nem múlna egyrészt nagy szerencsén, másrészt talán kevés dolgon. Pontot a küldetéskártyák jelentenek, darabonként bármilyen fajtából 5-öt, illetve címerek, darabonként 1-et, amiket több helyről lehet gyűjteni, de teljesen véletlenszerű, hogy pontosan milyen címert kap a játékos a hat fajtából. A játék végén ezek többségéért is lehet kapni még egy plusz címert. A laphúzásoknál is jelentkezik szerencse, ami szerintem teljesen belefér, de ez a pontozás nagyon nem nyerte el a tetszésemet sajnos, pedig egy nagyon jó kis játék lehetne a XIV. Lajos.

First of all, there ain't no intrigue going on here.  This is basically an abstract area control game with some kooky rule twists, special powers and pretty portraits.    That said, it is soundly solid for what it is.  The game offers many tough decisions and keeps you gripped 'till the end. Then of course, that is where the problems come in.   

There is a nice amount of luck that manipulates how you play rather than controlling it.  I like the use of Dorn's trademarked movement here, I'm always impressed how he finds ways to manipulate the same movement system into something that feels surprisingly new. 

But the shield scoring at the end is horrid and should be eliminated entirely, there is no reason to sweat over a couple points throughout the game, only to be randomly granted points at the end.  The secret is to luck into bonus points and not sweat the small stuff.  

This shield issue is minor to the biggest problem I have with the game. It seems that the card draw gets way too lucky.  Draw an objective, luck into big points draw again.  I won a game based solely on a run of really lucky draws.  I was randomly getting helmets and whatnot and just seeing what I could draw up.  A very hollow victory.

Then, of course, the cards are completely imbalanced but, I do have to say that the powers are quite fun and the cards to fulfill when they work as planned keep interests high, but for as much as this game has, I didn't walk away loving it, merely liking it, perhaps that will change with more plays.  

Update: After my last play, I've had zero desire to play this again.  I've ended up turning the game down multiple times.  It lost its luster quick.

Update: Hmm, played it again a years later, and while I still see the same problems in it, I still really enjoyed it.

It looks like dry area-control but the execution is incredibly tight. As a result it's exciting and plays briskly. Complaints about the size of the numbers on the cards aside, the components are interesting and are just what the game needs.

RATING: 6
A fun game, once you get past all the fiddly bits and figure it out.  Has a fair amount of strategy, but also a fair amount of luck, especially in the mission cards you draw.  Not a game for people who like simplicity; my wife decided she hated it about the time I had explained the third of four different decks of cards.  :)

Two, possibly three game learning curve with this. Even after three, you may know how TO play the game without actually knowing how to play it.
That said and looking forward to game four, it's a lot of fun. You don't see its depths right away, while you're fiddling with the mechanics. But as you get comfortable with those mechanics, you catch glimpses of strategic possibilities and the game's overall balance. Learning curve from here (after three games, all with opponents who were learning it at the same time) is still on the rise. I'm generally suspicious of "variants," which usually seem to upset a game's true balance in the interest of selling it as a two-player game. I thoroughly enjoyed the back-to-back, two-player games that preceded this rating. That rating, I suspect, will rise.

RATING: 8
LXIV is an area majority game, in which winning an area confers special rewards or abilities.  The regions are small square cards representing members of the Sun King's court.  Some of the cards give victory points, others provide "power chits", which bear symbols of helm, ring, scroll, holy hand grenade, or crown (wild), others allow movement or placement of additional influence markers.  On your turn, you play a card from your hand that allows placement of up to 3 influence markers on a specific region.  Once placed, some of the influence markers can be walked to diagonally adjacent cards.  Completing missions is what garners the most victory points.  Each player has two mission cards in every round (there are 4 rounds).  To fulfill a mission, a player must have the necessary power chits in hand (won in the area majority part of the game).

The components are just beautiful.  Gameplay is solid, with lots of tension.  There's plenty of scrambling for influence over the regions that provide power chits, and some bluffing.  Players are forced to vie for the same benefits, but the missions provide players with slightly different goals.  There are multiple layers of randomness to the game, but I don't feel it detracts.  I don't see this moving up to a 9 for me, but I do want to play it a bunch of times to find out!

RATING: 7.5
I would love to play this more, it's got a neat rhythm of gameplay unlike anything else, interesting strategic/tactical combinations, lots of good stuff going on.  But only four players, and a wee bit on the fiddly/unintuitive side, so it hardly ever hits the table.

RATING: 8.5
Effectively an area control game where you try to gain influence of advisors.  I can see my rating for this changing over time, but my impression from initial play is that it has some nice depth and great player interaction, but its potential is undermined by getting a little bogged down and being a little too fiddly.

UPDATE: Played it again, and it's not that fiddly. I really enjoy the interaction, even if the game's theme is a little abstract.

I like this game, but I think it would definitely be better with 3 or 4.  Thus far, I have only played with 2, and there wasn't enough conflict or tension because we could more or less stay out of each others' way most of the time. Still, it's a pretty tight game.

Excellent game.  I haven't gotten excited about many euro games this year (2007) -- seems like every time I try a new one, it just doesn't measure up to my old favourites.  Louis XIV, however, grabbed me from start to finish.  The only thing I didn't like was the random points awarded from coat-of-arms majority... I think next time I play, that rule will be taken out.  Other than that, top notch stuff and I think I'll be buying this one.

Felt too dry and routine.  Wouldn't mind giving it another try to make sure.  I've wanted to try it since I first heard about it, but it is missing something for me.  I kept thinking about El Grande and how I love that game, which is also influence-driven, so what is the difference?  I think in El Grande the different action cards you select drive the game and make it come alive, whereas here each turn is much more routine and it makes it fall flat.

I really like this game. Its got tough decisions and great tension. The theme is awesome, but could have been implemented better. 

Edit: One year later, this game is still as fun as when I first played. Use the rules on the BGG forums for 2 player variant, adding the 4th player really makes for a good time. Excellent area control type game, I realized the theme is well implimented , even if it is not explained in the rulebook. Oh wait, it is ;)

Edit: its a really excellent area influence game that is tense, cut throat, and exciting to the very end. Great with 2,3, and 4 players. Theme is well implemented, and historically relevant. The struggle for Louis' favor by his courts is immortalized by Dorn in a unique game. 10/10

when our group first tried to play, the game was completely impenetrable. we quit rather than continue with this strange burden. thankfully, the game owner made a study of the rules and led us through an enjoyable second game.  

while the core is bidding, this is modulated by other mechanisms and a rewarding variety of choices. despite the renaissance portraits, it is very abstract and any attempts to marry theme to mechanisms should be ignored. after all, is louis walking around stepping on a bunch of paintings?

there are a lot of unnecessary complications. set-up is fiddly diddly and the scoring of the shields takes an unexpected left turn. not for casual players.

Nice take on the area majority cum resource collection genre. The typical Dorn placement of your pieces yield some very interesting choices. I do have the nagging feeling that it's always best to go for the largest amount of completed missions, regardless of difficulty: so better pick the easy ones with lesser benefits, as you'll benefit from them only once or twice. Anyway, that's how I won both games I played.

My rating is colored by the fact that I've only played it as a two player game. That provides the mechanics, but I'm sure it would be better (perhaps an 8) with more players; I would rate it 6 or 6.5 as a two player game. The theme, intrigue in the court of the Sun King, is OK by Euro standards, but very thin compared to the historical games I'm more used to. The game play appears to have a good deal of depth.

Another game that I think is interesting but not necessarily -fun-.  There's no denying that the mechanics are interesting and unique, but the game feels too fiddly; it's too easy to forget to flip royals or whether your pieces should go to the general supply or the personal supply.  Neat area-majority feeling to the bribery but nothing feels quite intuitive enough to flow smoothly.  Maybe with more plays these problems would go away as the game flow becomes second nature, but I'm not sure I'm willing to give it enough tries for that to happen.

Generic Eurogame where you need to place varying amounts of influence markers to gain favour with some of the courtesans of the king (who make up the playing board). They in turn reward you with various items that you need to exchange for mission cards (victory points). It's playable enough but a few issues let it down, which means that it lags behind the plethora of games of this ilk a bit. I feel as though there's maybe one or two elements of strategy missing from the gameplay. These in turn would have increased the amount of decisions you have to make and would certainly have enhanced the playing experience. I also feel as though currency is too easy to come by in the game, again reducing the amount of decisions you have to make (it feels like a very easy game to play in that sense. You can just buy your way out of trouble in some situations). It might have been improved if players didn't receive the 5 gold at the start or if only the starting player received the gold bonus at the start of each round. Despite these flaws it's still an enjoyable enough game to play.

Played 2+ times.  Big game in a little box.  It's a bit tough to swallow a loss based on the random distribution of bonus chits, but there's only 6 points given out at the end so it's not that bad.  I also like that it rewards going after the single points, because I think it balances the strategies a little.  I definitely want to play again. 2006/12/13

Played two player, rating may rise (or may not!). 'Okay' would be my verdict. Some feel of courtly intrigue, but not a lot. Decision making was lightish, though doubtless this would improve with more players (though I guess control would decrease and frustration increase). Essentially a mix of El Grande, Goa and one of Richard Breese's resource management games. It lacks the hard edge of any of those because of the hidden goals for players which is a questionable design choice. 

Enjoyable, but more interesting because of the ideas the game puts in one's head.

PS Having gone through the rules once, and had a playthrough, it was much easier to understand this game than the fiddly rules would suggest.

In theory an interesting area control game. You must manage your limit resources and cards, you can choose the dificulty of the missions, that you will try to realise. 

The game seems to be random. When you have luck, you realise more missions, and you can get more 1 VP markers. Some bonuses of the realised missions won`t help you, because you must always try to realise next missions, so you can`t choose free, in what area you will try to win.

Take the worker placement of Caylus and add it to the area-control aspect of El Grande and you get this interesting game. A real brain burner where your pieces can cruelly count for nothing if someone else steals the action from you! It's a cut-throat game with nice twists and turns. Definitely pay more attention to those Coat-Of-Arms chips. Felt that the rule-bending powers of the Mission cards can sometimes be over-powered.

A different take on area majority that also works well with only 2 players. It's area majority, but all pieces get removed every turn, so you can't pile up your cubes on the board like in El Grande. You're restricted on the placement as well and you have to carefully plan how to use your cards and when to obtain more cubes instead of placement.

What a great area-majority game.  The placement mechanic is fun, as you have to stay fluid to get your markers where you want them.

So much changes between rounds of Louis XIV (influence cards, missions, requirements for scoring) that long term planning is basically non-existent.

Players who are doing well gain the more powerful abilities which - surprise - allows them to do better still. It's an interesting if abstract game with some unusual mechanics nevertheless. A tendency toward fiddly and some overly random elements also detract from my rating. Update: After a long time between plays, I recently revisited this one. I was probably a bit overly harsh in my initial assessment of the game ... there is a bit of the rich-get-richer syndrome here, but the game is short enough - only four rounds - that it didn't much bother me in my latest play. Rating upgraded to a 6. Not something I'm going to play all that often, but a keeper for me given its Alea pedigree and small box.

This is one of my current favorite games.  Another Dorn winner.  This is one that my girlfriend will suggest if we decide to play a game.

I have played a few other influence games (El Grande, Liberte, Bridges of Shangri-La among others), and I never feel like I have any clue who's going to win.  Because the influence part of the game is separate from direct scoring, I think this game is accessible to more people.

Louis XIV is a unique area majority game with a million chits and cards but a clever boardless design.  Brace for the byzantine scoring at the end by telling newbies, "Focus on the missions.  Don't worry; the game scores EVERYTHING you accomplish."

RATING: 6
Gameplay-wise, this is about a 7. It's a light area control game where you play a card to determine where you can place your pieces onto the board. You have to balance your money, your supply of markers, and your tokens. Simple to set up and plays pretty quickly. Not a bad 3 or 4 player game.

My rating is lowered because of the insane end-game scoring that awards points completely at random. The game has that "classic" euro feel where each player is usually tied or within one or two points of the other players, so the random end-game bonuses mean that the winner is usually just determined at random. I don't see how that got past playtesting. If I play again, we'll be definitely using a variant to fix the scoring problem.

Overall, a light, enjoyable game that is hampered by one major flaw.

RATING: 7
A fun tactical game that, with the dummy hand suggested in the rules, works well with 2 players although becomes slightly more complex with more.  I seem to be extremely bad at this game, but it is fun and hvaing card tiles rather than a board give it a distinct feeling and therefore make it a worthwhile to anyones collection.

Tension-packed from start to finish, trying to make the most of your placements and not knowing what your opponents have in their hand or what their goals are.  The tile flipping mechanism fits perfectly with the "board" and keeps the playing terrain dynamic.  Some might be unhappy with the randomness of the card and token draws, but I've never felt they distracted from the quality of the game experience (and I'm reasonably sensitive about those things).

RATING: 7
 Trying to get the most rewards without losing your strength for the next round.    The game is quite intuitive.   It feels like an auction game. 2 players has limited shelf life.  Its good for about 5 plays, but the players can learn to optimize the sparse board and it comes down to luck of the dummy player(s) and the coat of arms. With 3 players, the board is too sparse again plus it adds a fiddly rule. Its a fun efficiency game with 4 players, but ultimately its the only player count the game holds up to repeated play.  Its essentially a fun next step after gateway game for 4 players only.  Incredibly niche to say the least.  I still enjoy it, but the situations in which this game shine are few and far between.

Tactical, yet allows for different strategic styles.  

As far as the shields, they score, you know they'll score, make sure you get your points for their scoring. 

Many plays in and revisited.  The game dropped the ball.  More difficult missions should have been included.  I understand the balance reasons, but the common power interactions become played out and predictable after 20 plays.  A new expansion with more missions, and a possible ruleset for drafting missions to synergize would do wonders, however I don't think it will happen.  Newer games, which create controlled combos and many more interactions have outpaced this game leaving it mostly obsolete.  An expansion could fix this, but I can't see one coming down the pipeline.
 
The 2 player game evolves into a luck fest as the max strategy ceiling is intuitive and easily hashed out, the 3 player game has too much space, but with 4 its still a fun game.  I am retired from the 2 and 3 player game, so my personal scale for this game is from 4-4.

I knew I would like this game when I saw who else was cheering for it and that it had Rudiger Dorn's name on it, and I was not disappointed. It is an area-influence game, but (unlike El Grande for example) the 'board' resets every time things are evaluated, so a leader is easier to beat up on. There is some possibility of a runaway leader with the Mission cards; if one player gets too big a power advantage he can become hard to stop. In fact that happened in my first game as I ran away with it, but my analysis is that that is not likely to happen with a little bit of experience. And in fact in my third game, just a little bit of focus on a leader (even though I wasn't leading as strongly) and a little bit of emphasis on how valuable the crowns are led to a much tighter game, which I narrowly lost. I do not think there is a runaway leader problem. The powers of the mission cards allow an early leader to mitigate some of the beating that he will get from experienced players, but they are not so overwhelming that it is not possible to overcome. 

My second play was with 3 players. We missed the rule about the guy who starts twice getting an intrigue card as compensation. Nevertheless, I do not think the 3-player game is as good as the 4-player version. The bidding wars are just not tight enough, and it is too easy to win tiles cheaply.

One Play Rating. The first game I played seemed like the mechanics lead my decisions. Lots of luck in the draw of the influence cards, if they are the ones or close to the ones you need you will do better. The shields also have a strong element of luck in getting the most in one type or not. The game just seemed to me like I was going through the motions and not really making many significant decisions. Lots of "use my last card to screw somebody" tactics.

An 8.5 rating if played with three, drops significantly with just two players though. My only major complaint with this game is the amount of AP that goes on, and the resulting downtime for other players. In the last game of Louis I had (3 player) 2 of us had enough downtime to play a game of Fairy Tale on the side during downtime. Otherwise a pleasure to play, although its frustrating when you just need ONE more influence marker to fulfill your carefully thought out plan >.< but that just adds to the fun :)

Mostly tactical, but also some strategy. Interesting decisions are related to fulfilling expensive missions to gain the benefit later or sticking with the cheaper ones. Collecting enough shields can make the difference in the end score. Main negatives: 'screwage factor' is high (e.g. Intrigue cards) and the game is rather fiddly (e.g. turning over tiles).  Best with 4 players.

The game this wanted to be is good, but the game that it IS falls short of expectations.  The influence is a simple and effective system, but I don't necessarily love the flipping of tiles.  It adds variance to the rounds, but there's so few of them, and the rounds where the major tiles are all first-player only are so vicious, that it can mean major screwage for players.  Some of the cards are much, much better than others, even within the same difficulty level, and there's no compensation for drawing a stinker.  In many ways, this has made all the sacrifices of theme and flavor that define Euros, but doesn't have strong enough mechanics to keep it interesting.

Players alternate placing guys on the board, then collect tokens from the various spots. Some spots require a majority, some a set amount of guys, some cost gold. Randomly dealt cards determine where you can place guys, so you can't always get the guys you need in the spots you want. Players spend their collected items on mission cards, which provide abilities, as well as points for end game. Repeat for several rounds, and you're done.

Not spectacular, but it's quick and fun. A solid 7 so far.

1 play. 4 players. This game is more like El Grande and I didn't like El Grande that much. I also didn't like the way the cards had to be arranged and the constant flipping of the cards.

First play - 4 players - I like this game. I didn't do well because I neglected to get the items I needed for my mission cards. I was trying to get influence where everyone else wasn't and that doesn't help your score any. By the second round I figured out what needed to be done and I got back into the game quickly. By the last round I had caught up and I was poised to make a run at the leader BUT even with the extra mission card all of my missions required the SCROLL. Every one of them. And of course in the fourth round EVERYONE needed the scroll. I had 2 extra influence cards as well that round. 5 of my 7 cards were WILD! and the other 2 were four. I couldn't compete for the scroll so I just went for shields. At the end I still only had 4 missions done and everyone else had 5 or 6. I beat the player with 5 but IC ouldn't catch up to the 6 mission players. Not bad for a first go. I look forward to the next play.

Good worker placement, area control game.

Louis is in my view the most interesting implementation of Dorn's moving tower concept, and for that mechanic alone is worth having in my collection, as the experience is both highly entertaining and unique. Ultimately it is a tactical affair- you draw cards of various types and see what you can do with them. But there are enough bells and whistles here to keep the decisions engaging, plus the tension of when, where and how to commit your influence is delicious. Solid mid-weight game, albeit with a heavy rules overhead.

RATING: 7
A unique and good area control game. The only reason I do not rate it higher  because it is fiddly in a bad way. By this I mean there is lot of moving around of bits for the sole purpose of distributing points or clearing the board. You do not make any decisions and are just executing a mechanical chore. (This refers to the scoring phase  when the payout is made, I wish a computer were handling all the stuff).

This extends the game's length to more than it should be and leaves me less than satisfied.

Contrast this to Puerto Rico, which also has a lot of moving parts but they seem well integrated in the game and thematially. So, I would call Puerto Rico fiddly in a good way 

Louis has mechanics that are very nice though and I do enjoy the core gameplay.
If it were more streamlined, I would rate it a 8.

A very unconventional game, but an enjoyable one. I find the influence mechanics to be very interesting and unlike anything else I've played. I also like that there are multiple viable paths to victory. The two major black spots for me are that some missions are much more helpful than others (to the point where I almost want to house rule a Race for the Galaxy-like "start mission", except I think that would make the first round less interesting), and that the coat of arms scoring adds an unwelcome random element to that particular method of scoring (which has affected finishing order in about a quarter of my plays, and victory once). Overall, it's a fun game; I gave it to a friend of mine who likes it more than I do, but he's in my gaming group so I still get to visit :)

I like the coat of arms scoring as is. More constraints than I expected, which is actually a good thing in a game like this (would degenerate rather nastily otherwise). Not encouraged so far by my 2-player outings, which is unfortunately why I got it (enough great 3-4p games). System is too damped, creating artificially close finishes. Much like Palazzo, this feels clunky and cobbled-together rather than elegant.

Have not yet played with the Favorite, or with the official 2p rules (which sound better in theory, though still seems like more luck than fits the game).

This is a very interesting game.  The strategy is very subtle, but I think it is ultimately too luck of the draw driven to make it to my upper echelon of games.  

I enjoy the mission card system, but some missions are MUCH more powerful than others.  You can also get hosed by your missions requiring the same chits (helmets, rings, etc.) as your other missions.  This increases your dependency on winning crowns which is not a good thing in my mind.  

That said, it is a unique game in my group, and it will probably get some more play.  However, I doubt that it will become a mainstay in the group as many other games have.

Now played with 3,  and it plays out quite similarly.  We read the rules for a 2er and that seems to play with a random neutral player (seems like a hack).   First player in a 3er seems to be at a disadvantage,  having to go first twice,  but all ended well ;)  Turns out you have to be very careful how you read the rules on how many markers you start with - the numbers in the hint section tell you how many to put in the "central supply",  NOT the ones you have on hand :P  Marker disadvantage didn't slow me down any though...

Like Goa, I think I will like this one more after another couple of plays.  Again, like Goa, so much going on that I had a hard time following the bouncing ball the first time.

Much better after second play.  Works remarkably well with two.

First two plays didn't really excite me, but now it's growing on me. An original majority game with a neat placement mechanic (something that is becoming a trademark for the designer Rudiger Dorn). UPDATE: After more plays upgraded to 7. The game grows on me and I really like it.

Takes some getting used to. But once the intricacies of the rewards are understood, it plays very intuitively. Even so, once you have the mechanics down, it's still a bit of a brainburner.

I found this game solidly designed and developed (like all alea games) but it doesn't have enough of an arc (in the sense of a beginning, middle and end) for me - the four rounds play out almost the same each time in pattern without much alteration other than the few mission cards which have some small effect. Would play again if requested, but not one to keep in my collection.

A nice area control/ influence/ mission fulfillment game.  Thematically it is terrific, and I really enjoyed the influence phase of this game. There was a bit too much randomness associated with the mission distribution and the scoring phase at the very end, otherwise I would have rated it higher.

I wanted to be able to win just once - which took more than a few games - and then I was finished with it.

A meandering approach to area majority placement that is understandably well-regarded by people who enjoy those types of games.

Played a few times (with 3 or 4 players). Not a bad game, but the rules are too complex for what it is, and unnecessarily fiddly. The randomness in the shields draw seems a bit useless - and considering the low number of game turns, going for the easiest missions looks like the safest choice (especially considering that you cannot store more than one mission token), and it won't bring fewer points in the end.

{ P - [3] [4] }

Solid area control game centered around efficiency and securing benefits for no more than they're worth. Creative board structure, good production values, innovative design in how the rooms are scored in sequence and some missions / cards / rooms can affect other rooms. The missions within difficulty tiers are unique but balanced, and when you have certain missions, the benefit from certain rooms can become more useful (e.g. winning ties mission + room 6, or three guys mission + room 11).  Money and bribing is a secure route that offers reward with minimal piece investment and reclaiming your influence; it's often tricky to determine if the best route is straight winning your mission tiles or money + bribing them. Coat of Arms offers a scoring mechanism that isn't as high risk as mission tiles.

Downside I think the hard double-helmet "super jester" mission isn't good enough (maybe throw down 5 pieces instead of 4) and the medium 2/2/2 missions are a bit too good.

We use the suggested rule where your initial hand of missions is 1/1/1, maximum of 3, rather than 1/1/0, maximum of 2, and for the life of me I cannot figure out why this wouldn't just be the default. Are you supposed buy your medium, then draw a hard and hope you can play it with one wild and another leftover hex? C'mon. Also this reduces the odds of the dreaded "every mission in my hand shows the same symbol" mishap.

This is another game that I love. Yes, it's a bit fiddly, but the benefits massively outweigh this minor drawback. I also think that, for an abstract game, the theme really works well.

The one drawback to this game is the ridiculous game-end messing about with coats of arms. We ditched it in favour of the much better variant proposed by Sheldon Smith (EyeInSky).

RATING: 7.5
Interesting game with some elements reminiscent of El Grande and Shadow of the Emperor. Need a good understanding of all elements from the get go, since each bad decision may cost you a point or two, and with most Ruediger Dorn games, it appears scoring will be very tight. Felt that the luck of the shield draws/bonus was a bit overpowered given how close the rest of the scoring has been. I like it, but one poor move or bad decision can completely take you out of the running -- that's how important every single point is.

For a medium-sized game Louis XIV sure pack quite a punch in terms of rules complexity.  On the one hand, it makes for a meaty and dense gameplay.  On the other, it's really a big hurdle to get through in order to enjoy all that it has to offer.  The area majority aspect combined with the neat influence marker placement often result in some intense battle from round to round, especially among the characters that reward the mission markers (almost too much sometimes, which cause the other 6 to seem weaker in comparison).  Unfortunately, the imbalance in the mission card powers, as well as the non-sensical coat of arms scoring, make the game seems "luckier" than it should be.

I was a bit underwhelmed by Louis XIV; maybe I'm becoming a jaded gamer.  Anyway, the mechanics are sound and the game is pleasant enough, but I was expecting more.  Maybe I'll find the depth I was looking for with subsequent plays.

RATING: 8
A very satisfying game where you feel you are constantly doing things and you don't lose your time. This is a game with a small interaction that I like. As other Dorn's games Louis XIV is a very tactic game with simple rules. As most of others Dorn's games, the rulebook  is very convoluted and unthematic in consequence scares the new players. I find that the mechanics integrate into the theme but not completely. For example,  the two influence markers pools (private and general) and the mechanics associated to move them are counter intuitive; yes, it is to introduce the scarcity feeling, but thematically has no sense. Flipping the tile is an unthematic mechanic (for the purpose of variety). People complain about the complicated rules with some detail which unjustly reduces the ranking of this game. Games in the BGG top 50 have even more complicated, fiddly ans some others terrible rulebooks: War of the rings, Terra mystica, X-wing, Game of thrones.

Beautiful art.  A clever theme for an area-control game.

Edit: Dropping my rating a half-point.  The randomness of the coat-of-arms scoring bugs me, as does the convoluted set of area control-tiebreakers.  Still a great game in my book.

I am increasingly impressed with Rüdiger Dorn as a game designer.  Louis XIV provides enough "noise" in the game to keep the struggle for influence and benefits interesting in replays.

Also, thankfully, despite what I'd been told - "It's a game that takes 45 minutes to teach and 20 mintues to play" - it was untrue.  I read the rules, which may have taken 45 minutes, but then taught the game in 15 minutes.  I think the education would have gone better but slower if I'd instead just had us all play a face-up demo round.  Also, needless to say (since the game is rated at 75-100 minutes), Louis XIV did not take 20 minutes to play.  Perhaps I need a better ability to detect hyperbole.  ;^)

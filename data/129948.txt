RATING: 7
This game was suggested to me at Dice Tower Con 2015, so I ended up picking up the German language version of this game later that year. I have mixed feelings about it. It's a beautiful game, but having played a bunch now I don't think there are very many interesting decisions, and the cards don't mix it up all that much. Probably a candidate from trade eventually.

RATING: 7
Initial thoughts after 2 plays (2 player).
Hmmm, just ok so far. We might have one too many games in this weight range. So far I would rather play Vikings, Cinque Terra, Finca in this same vein. It isn't bad at 2 players and would still get play rotation. Look forward to more plays and hope to try it with higher player counts.

Finally got  game with 3 players and it is a better game. Would like to try 4 because the game length is reasonable. Even with 3, the score for one player was over 150 points but that is part of the variability if the end game conditions. I am now happier with the purchase.

RATING: 7
Feels very much like many other Euro games, with nothing to make it stand out. The wheel and tile-laying aspect are reminiscent of Kiesling's Vikings, and this is a good alternative to that hard-to-find title, but ultimately this game feels like a solid, but not exceptional strategy game.

6 plays / 3,4 players

LIKE: The self-scoring mechanisms make the game feel different, interesting. Fast, smooth game. Fun to grab free bricks from the wheel. Good player interaction, escpecially with the advanced version.

DISLIKE: Expensive and hard-to-find. Theme is a bit dry and can be hard to get to the table at first. The production didn't need wooden victory set collection bits, chits would have been fine.

OVERALL: Players look confused when they first hear the game described, but after they play, people enjoy this one. The mechanisms work and it's delightful to buy buildings and bricks, but you still need to keep an eye on your opponents. Deciding who ends the game can be tense. The advanced game is necessary.

I was so anxious to get this one - I paid a premium to acquire it. But you know what? It just doesn't play as well as I hoped. I like the concepts alot, however. The tension between the variety of scoring and money options is wonderful really. It is punishing if you get behind in money since that drives the entire game. What fails for me is the scoring system at the end. It seems clunky and out of place - especially so without using the optional expansions (?). So dang it - not a game for me really.

Very little fun, since the game doesn't offer any interesting decisions. However, I could play if there's enough beer to quench the thirst for something else.

Clearly a fiver. Collect resources and compete with others who gets to score the cities first. Some decisios to make but most of the time the best move is quite obvious. However, strategywise there is bit more to the game because you can choose to play either cheap or rich, fast or slow. And this is really the only interesting part of the game. 

Actually I have to wonder what made me rate the game a four previously, because the game is not broken nor particularly annoying, just a bit boring maybe but still ok.

Decent game in a big box.  Nothing really new here, but great production value.  The wheel market from [b]Vikings[/b] shows up again.  This time, it's a very linear deal.  Buying buildings is very straight-forward, but scoring takes much planning.  That's really where the game is.  I kinda felt the same way after I tried [b]Asara[/b].  This game made me want to play [b]Macao[/b] again.

A nice enough game that uses the wheel mechanism from Vikings.  I like the different scoring options.  Plays somewhat quickly, largely due to the limited actions.  While there are some choices to be made, gameplay is very straight forward and narrow.  Buy bricks, construct a building in a city, score when you want/need to.  Repeat.  Feels very dry and borderline monotonous.  There's definitely a lot of timing at work since other players can cut you off for city scoring and objects (building type thingies).

Not my favorite of games.  The only distinguishing point for me was the pricing wheel mechanism.  Everything else is a game-imposed engine with a few choices.  The choices are variations on a theme and dictate the "strategy" employed, though that's really just one choice propagated down the line.  I'd play this again, and maybe I'll warm up to it a bit, but I'm not going to seek it out.

1st play: I liked the game overall. Components were appealing, functional and useful. The game has a race feel to it, and I didn't expect the end game to come up so fast. The rotating marble with progressive discounts made for interesting decisions

2nd play: Still a great game. I approach the game feeling like it's going to be a meaty, solid euro, and it is. Then I look at the clock and it's only been 55 minutes. At this length, the game is excellent, plenty of choices, tension and racing.

The 'beginner' version of this game seems too random with few good decisions to make. However, I think that the advanced rules may take this one from 'decent' to 'good' for me. But I haven't tried them out yet. The base rules on their own are a little bit random for my tastes.

RATING: 8
It's clear that K&K mined this game pretty significantly when they came out with Porta Nigra. I had played and quite enjoyed the latter game many times before finally trying this one. I think PN is probably a better game actually, though I quite like some of the ideas here too. The way the brick wheel works is interesting and rewards players who can time things properly (and may reward someone to the left of a player who cannot). We played with the 8 cost expansion/promo buildings, and they felt nearly broken, causing scores of those who got them to sky rocket. I like how you get to choose when to score your own board, it gives the game a good constant tension as you want to maximize it but also have to keep an eye on when the game may suddenly end. I'd definitely happily play again, but probably without the extra buildings.

RATING: 6
And so to Renaissance Italy once more.  Once more the King wants some building work done.  The lack of invention in the theme extends to the game.  From these designers, Palaces could not be less than workmanlike; sadly it is no more.

There are decisions about what stones to buy (the most prestigious cities are choosy) and when (the cost of unbought stones reduces progressively).  There is a balance to be kept between money and victory points.   There is an uncertain game end, which, if you're keeping track, will prompt decisions about the best use of turns in the late game. The advanced game adds a little interest with variable game end conditions and bonuses.

Production quality is to HiG's usual standards.  I found the artwork pretty non-descript.

A good family game. Nice components, simple rules and limited luck involved. The play duration isn't bad either. On the flip side, the game has nothing new to offer and it is not well suited to heavy gamers. The luck factor, while limited, might prove significant in some key stages of the game.

Finally got around to playing Palaces (the advanced rules), and I was not disappointed.  This is a good game.

Typically, I do not like rondel  or"wheels of value" mechanics very much in a game, but somewhat to my surprise,  I did like the "wheel of value" mechanic in this game.  It had a curious warmth to it, an almost happy little personality.  And It felt fun to think about, as the nicely colored blocks rotated around and tempted me. Get tiles or build something?  Hmmmm....I like both!

I  love the quirky originality of how, and when, you score in this game, as well as the simple, but curiously interesting, mechanic of essentially having many different currencies (different colored blocks) to consider.   

All in all, I am just very impressed with the simple design ideas in this game that, nevertheless, manage to shine warmly.  Well done!  Going to give it an 8 of 10. December 2017.

After a second three player play, going to actually raise my rating to a 9.  This is an unusually simple and pleasant game, with a few really curious, dare I say delightful, spices added.  Hey, who put the ginger and turmeric in my milk?  January 2018.

RATING: 5
The base game is painfully dull and is only good for teaching the game. Thankfully the included "expansion" (read: the rest of the game) makes it a little more enjoyable, adding more choices, depth, and strategy. Unfortunately it doesn't really make the game interesting enough and instead just plods along until someone finally ends it. Incredibly weak theme that doesn't do anything to make sense of the game mechanics. Sold it off.

Played basic 4 player game as first game.  Played fourth and felt at disadvantage.  The other three players each started to build in income giving town.  There are three of those.  So immediately I was unlikely to be the first to reach the required number of buildings in which to score a city which felt like a significant disadvantage.  The game was very dry, like working a spreadsheet.  There were some interesting ideas and I would play again to explore further.  But there are much better and more fun games around to play.

Very Kramer&Kiesling.  It's not only about getting bricks to build, it is about optimizing every turn to get the most useful bricks at the better price, and do the buildings right in time to be able to score the cities.  Only played the base game in Yucata, which I think is great.  Looking forward to play with new objectives and the rest of the options of the expansion.

I didn't bother to play the basic game (because many fellow geeks recommended to skip to the expanded/advanced version), and I must admit I found something very interesting in the gamer's game.
(The way the rulebook is organized, with 12 pages of basic rules and then the parts you need to modify to play the expanded/advanced version, is quite annoying)

In your turn you can do one of three possible actions: acquire one or more colored bricks (using a very clever wheel-driven market), build or upgrade one building, or score. Timing is everything!

The design has nothing particularly fresh, and the theme is the more old-fashioned you can conceive: build palaces in renaissance Italy! Nevertheless, this game is an example of what an experienced author and a professional developer can achieve with the same old elements: a fast paced and streamlined middle-weight euro (typical Hans im Gluck) that plays smoothly and gives players food for thought.

RATING: 8.5
Palaces of Carrara is very good euro game that has aspects of tableau building, engine building and racing. The game provides players with some control over the progression and regression through the various resource collection and building phases of the game. This control results in the need to constantly watch what your opponents are doing. If you fail to account for your opponents correctly, your score can lag quite a bit behind the leader. Put a bit more simply, this game can be unforgiving to players that fail to account for how a particular session is playing out.

The basic game, at least, provides a decent experience and can be used as a game that allows you to go from rules to playing within 5 to 10 minutes. But note that experienced players will likely destroy beginners even in the basic game. This rating, however, is based on the "expanded" game. Even under the "advanced" rules, this game  exhibits its quality if everyone at the table is of a similar skill/experience level with the game.

The "expanded" game feels like the true game. Using the advanced rules, Palaces provides plenty of tactical and strategic choices; some potential for player asymmetry (e.g., upgrade tiles); and variable game-ending objectives. In other words, the decision space of the "expanded" game is much wider than the basic game.   

Additionally, the decisions of when to score and when to grab certain resources or buildings are interesting. You'll need to keep track of the objectives to ensure you are efficiently moving towards them while balancing your economic needs.

The endgame is highly player dependent, which is good. But I'm not so sure there needs to be three layers of randomness (objective cards, resource blocks, building tiles). My hope is that the randomness merely provides game-to-game texture differences to the decision-making.

Even so, I'm not sure how excited this game makes me.

RATING: 7.75
First Play: Basic game followed immediately by the expanded game. I agree that it should be an easy task for a reasonably experienced gamer to jump straight in with the advanced rules but the basic game is no where near as bad as some people have made out. It was challenging and still worth playing.

Overall I'm impressed. There are a bunch of evolving decisions that need to be made and what appear to be multiple paths to victory. The fact we played twice in the same evening speaks volumes.

I would recommend that some ettiquette is observed with regard to the removal and payment of goods. There was some back tracking in our game and confusion over where goods had been taken from. I'd suggest that the requisite money is laid down in clear sight and the goods removed to obtain a nod from at least one other player. Taking the cubes behind your screen and then throwing the coins into the bank was not the way to go.

Very fast and with experienced players a very meaty filler. A keeper.

Second play: Revealed how steep the learning curve is after the first play. The need to concentrate on the 3 end conditions to achieve extra points and finish the game early is invaluable. Game played out in 50 minutes and was brought to a brutally swift end that left the new comers stunned and none to impressed. This is a chunky filler+ where people are expecting another 40 minutes of game.

I had high expectations for this Kramer/Kiesling design and it fell short. I learned the advanced game right off the bat, apparently a "no no" to do as the game strongly suggests playing the basic version before the advanced version. The two of us who were new to the game did not time things well and we were destroyed by the two experienced players. I really liked the mechanic for turning the wheel and acquiring bricks, but most everything else about it felt a bit too abstract and calculating for me. I hope to play this one again so I can get a better feel, but my first play did not meet expectations.

I played the advanced version and it is better, but I'm still not loving this game.  It's okay and I might play it again, but I probably won't.

Interesting mechanics and swift gameplay. It felt a bit too complex for how short the gameplay is (in my case, 15 minute ling explanation and 45 minute game). It felt weird and wrong that players' resources are hidden. Strategy wise, I didn't feel "in power", there seems to not be too much of strategy involved with the amount of random effects (building and marble selection). The scoring scale should definitely be 100 and not 50.

Nothing new under the sun: the Palaces of Carrara is just another boring and unrewarding eurogame where you stockpile resources, outguess your opponents, grind as most points as you can and, if you take a wrong step, are punished severely, all of which while yawning and snorting.

Buy blocks with money, on a neat rondel thingy. Trade in blocks for buildings. Periodically score your buildings in different categories, getting either money or points. SCore points at end for leftover money and buildings played/scored already. Some tension over some scorings. Played only the base game, but really looking forward to the advanced one. 

Advanced game is really just a variable end game scoring setup and a few more options during play. Recommended.

A set collection game where timing is everything and your action choice can have significant consequences (butterfly effects) that help or hurt your opponents.  Often it's hard to tell how much your action will impact opponents because new cubes and tiles come out at random (or semi-random).  You have some ability to plan and prepare based on the sectors of the cube wheel, but this is minimal considering that you can only take cubes from one sector per turn and the number of cubes in each color is limited.  The more prestigious (expensive) cubes are more versatile and can be used in place of less prestigious (cheaper) cubes, but you still seem to get stuck because you run out of money or because you're waiting for a color cube to be drawn from the bag or spent (thus returned to the bag) by opponents.  The luck of the tile/cube draws, the brinksmanship of using cubes of certain colors, the heavy dependence on timing, and the race to lock your opponent out of scoring for certain city colors drained the fun out of this game for me.

I enjoyed this and would like to give it another go. Some interesting mechanics, particularly the rondel which determines when resources come out. After a single play, I haven't learnt yet how to optimise that, but that I think would come with time. Lots of difficult timing issues between money/VPs and about when to score cities to optimise your score/earnings without losing out to another player. Definitely worth another look.

The Palaces of Carrara is yet another "family game" with a mean streak. Players must work the wheel so they get what they need without giving everyone else bargains and simultaneously control the game pace so that they can make the final score and end the game before anyone else is able to make their big scores. Although my initial thought was that playing without the variable goals/scoring was more noob friendly, I think the opposite is true. Like Dominion, the variable goals/scoring means that experienced players have to continually re-evaluate their strategies and thus new players have a fighting chance. The optional wheel movement/scoring of types/level-8 buildings/building upgrades all add a little complexity without altering strategies too much. This is probably my favorite "social game" pickup in the past 6 months and one I am quick to reach for with 4 or less players. I think it will be a little tough for my 8 yro and will not be introducing it to my kids for a while.

A much lighter offering from Kramer + Kiesling. Would like something meatier for gamers from this dynamic duo; not this family fare. Just a quick point grab game. Some crazy combos that score you tons of points.

It got tiring fast. Like a gerbil on a wheel. Buy some color cubes, then convert them to a building. Then score some points. And voila, we've built up Renaissance Italy. Such an original theme.

I must admit that I'm not a big fan of Kramer Kiesling games. They are mostly too dry and mechanic for my taste and I just don't find them very appealing.

The Palaces of Carrara feels very much like a typical Kramer Kiesling design with solid mechanisms and balanced scoring but absolutely no connection to the theme. The game is not too complicated even with the expansion rules included and game flows fluently from start to finish but apart from the challenge of optimization the fun is missing. I'll give it another go but my hopes are not very high.

I've played this game just the once, and once was enough.  I really enjoyed it until we were not much over 30 minutes into the game (4 players) when the guy who owned it and had played it previously announced the end; this being because he had fulfilled the objectives.  (We were playing the advance version because he knew the game well enough to teach us)   He then proceeded to zoom round the score track with final bonus scores whilst one of the group - one of our best players normally - scored zero!

I'm aware of the reason for the current popularity of these 'objectives' that change each time one plays the game.  Their aim is to provide a differing gaming experience each time.  But the final scores that they trail in their wake, dwarfing all of the scores that have been built up during the playing, is an absolute killer in my eyes and I shall be delighted when they get consigned to gaming history.

I haven't played with the expansion yet, but the base game is a little too simple and repetitive for my taste. The market mechanic is fun, and I like the design of the city-color correlation and the varying scoring benefits of the cities. It just seemed like we were doing the same thing over and over again after a while. It wasn't bad, but at some point I wanted something more to do. 

I also don't like the end-game rules, which only give players a final turn if they succeeded the ending player in turn order. This makes no sense to me because the first player never has an advantage: everything is significantly more expensive during the first turn, so going first is actually kind of a drag. Will try again with the expansion.

UPDATE: Tried again with the expansion. Man, this is not our kind of game. It can be incredibly vicious when a player scores a city just to block someone else, and with the optional wheel turn rule from the expansion the game sometimes slows to a crawl. The 8-block buildings are too easy to build, and the scoring benefits they give are outrageous. I can see this being a really deep game after dozens of plays, but as I am never going to play this very much, it's not a keeper for me. Sold.

First play with 4 players.   It's relatively simple in its mechanics,  you have one of three actions you can take each turn.  It plays fast, it's strategy is much deeper that first appears; and it has great quality components.  This should be a no brainer for a reprint barring some legal entanglement(bought mine from Amazon.de while the Euro is trading low).  This will get added to my regular gaming rotation.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Great, simple and elegant racing tableau-building strategy game with really smooth gameplay, but yet very deep strategy-wise (it feels light-weight but it plays as a solid medium-weight game).
++ I love the fact that you are actually choosing what and when to score your tableau as part of your actions and for a finite number of time (6).
++ I absolutely love the variable end-game objective cards, which change the end of game conditions and the final scoring at every game (Epic replayability!).
++ I love the brick wheel that set the price. It's simple and yet there is so much strategy that can be made by turning it or not, before buying.
++ I love the 8-cost buildings and the upgrade. It's a simple concept that add so much strategy and thinking into the game.
++ Beautiful artwork and good graphic design of the main board and player boards (everything is clear and precise).
++ Easy to teach (but harder to master though), somewhat fast to set-up and smooth to play.


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- The beginning of the game kind of feel always the same (just buying blocks), as we need to start building up our ressources.
-- Since it's a race game to reach the end-game condition, the end game can happen quite fast and unexpectedly for players that do not monitor carefully other players. This can lead to wildly different score between players and thus give a bad feeling at the end of the game for players that didn't expected it (this also stress out my wife). 
-- A games can take anywhere from 45 minutes to 90 minutes depending on the end-game conditions cards drawn (some cards favor short games, others favor longer games), so it can be hard to plan to play a game. But we can still mitigate this by choosing a bit our end-game condition cards.
-- This game can bog down some AP-prone people that try to figure out the best moves.
-- For an unknown reason, this game "stress out" my wife when she plays it.
-- This game take a fair bit of table space, with the central board, the player's boards, the player's constructions, the end-game objectives mat and the 8-cost buildings and the upgrade tiles displayed along the board.
-- Because of the two modes included, the rule book is confusing and way too long/heavy for this streamlined game.
-- I rarely complain about this kind of thing, but the box is too tall for nothing.
-- Since it is out of print (OOP) in both English and French, only the German version is available for purchase for a higher price than most other similar game on the market, so the value is a bit lower than it could be normally.

I am on a mission to master The Palaces of Carrara, in order to determine whether it contains a game worthy of playing.

My first play of the game was rather terrible.  It was late at night in the middle of BGG.Con, and the mechanics seemed dated and uninspiring.  We dove directly into the advanced game (despite the warning on the label) and I found myself in dead last.  I rated it a 4. 

Months later, when the game had been nominated for the Kennerspiel des Jahres, I began thinking about the game again.  I wondered whether I had missed something - whether my poor performance reflected a lack of understanding.  I mentally grappled with the base game rules for weeks (I say "mentally" because I was deconstructing the game, not actually playing it) in order to better understand optimal play strategies.  The conclusion I reached was that the game contained much more nuance and subtlety than I had initially thought.

Fine Euro with just enough going on to maintain its grip on your attention while still feeling lighter weight. It suffers a bit because it lacks an innate sense of excitement. For that reason alone, it will never be a game I reminisce on or frame a game night around.

RATING: 8
The mechanics are fairly simple. Get bricks to build places which you then score for either money to buy more bricks or points.

Which is awesome, because it then puts the pressure on how best to win the game considering the random endgame and scoring rules which were flipped during set up. I love these types of games. 

Unlike most, this one is slightly less strategic and slightly more tactical because you are racing against your opponents towards certain objectives that only one player can obtain. So you do have an early plan, but you may have to change it if someone with a similar plan achieves certain milestones first (or you may have to alter yours to guarantee hitting those milestones first).

PoC is a solid, light-medium eurogame – but that’s perhaps its biggest problem; there are hundreds of games which fit into this category, so a game really has to feature something unique in order to be interesting. While I do think it has some interesting stuff going on, they aren’t so exciting that I want to play it all the time. I obviously played with the advanced rules as I’m sure the game is too boring without them. The game is not Le Havre-fiddly, but it is fiddly that you constantly need to refill the wheel up to 11 marbles and that you need to remember to flip a building each time one is removed.

The “pricing wheel” mechanic a la Vikings was good, and I actually prefer it in Palaces of Carrara. The rest of the game doesn’t remind me of Vikings. I loved the various goals you have for each game as they make each game totally different, and I think this is the game’s biggest asset. The game is also quite tense when you need to decide when to score a city; I think it’s a good move by the designers that only a single player can score a given city in the entire game! It certainly adds tension, and it’s sort of the same feeling you get when there is only one route in Ticket to Ride left which you really need to claim (not that the two games can be compared in any other way, though). One final  thing I want to mention is that the endgame criteria works well; the game ends either if all of the buildings get bought or if you have fulfilled the goal cards (not that you instantly win when doing so, but you get 5 points for this before you tally up your points).

I wasn't as excited to play this because the idea of trading blocks in for buildings seemed kind of dull, there are so many games out there like it, but I actually liked this Euro. It's a good middle weight game with a visually appealing wheel, similar to Vikings, that dictates the price of the blocks. I like the decision making of what to buy, what buildings to build, and when to score. Just don't fall too far behind on points because there's not much a player can do to come back.

RATING: 8
For a first playthrough with the basic rules this still plays in the listed playing time which is fantastic. There is a nice push your luck element with trying to figure out when to score and get a little bit more or potentially being locked out from a big pay out. The theme certainly is a bit dry, but it is so fast and fluid that I felt engaged the entire time. My only minor complaint is the constant refilling of the wheel every time you turn it can be a bit fiddly. In the advanced rules that doesn't always happen so maybe that would help, but really this is an outstanding game, it's a shame it was never truly printed in English.

The different objective cards add to replayability, and the trade-off between cheap materials and resource versatility nicely affect how you are going to distribute your buildings around cities.

This game has a similar mechanic to vikings. I was surprised how quickly the end of game conditions were satisfied, with the game being killed by one player fairly quickly. Even though I came a relatively close second, I felt like I had left a lot undone! Made me realise the game has a strong 'race' element to it that is not readily apparent. Will know better next time.

Hmmm... perhaps my hopes were a little high given the amount of time I waited for Z-Man to never publish this, and to import it from Germany. It's a pretty light game, even with the expansion. I was expecting something more on along the lines of Java/Cavum given the size of the box. I really really really stunk it up on my first playing (like the winner got 5x my score, all 1st time players), which probably doesn't help, but I wasn't as excited by wheel o' resources as I expected. It felt frustrating to have so little control on what's available by the time it gets back to you. I'm also not a fan of hidden trackable info. Hopefully it will click a little more on subsequent plays.

Palaces of Carrara is a very bare-bones resource gathering and spending on buildings-game. Resources appear on a central wheel which gets turned around thus affecting their price; and the resources are then spent on buildings with purposefully artificial characteristics. Resources are distinguished by colour with some colours being more expensive than others; also the location of the buildings requires resources of a specific colour. Money is tight in this game: a player can ask for but most 6 payouts in points and money, and the annoying thing is that many of these payouts are unique, meaning that if an opponent does this before you, you have to pick a different one. Since such a payout is tied to a specific city, and your presence in a different city may be weak... you get the idea. The game end is variable, and dependent on randomly drawn condition cards: a great mechanism to give the whole replayability because players must strive for [i]truly[/i] different things each time.

Because money is short; some payouts are unique; buildings are preyed upon by everyone; and the resource wheel turns, making the resources cheaper; the game in fact has a very nasty side. It is about meticulously timing your purchases and expenditures; get them wrong and you lose. Conversely if you can derail the plans of others you win. You wouldn't expect this sort of nature to be present in the brightly coloured and illustrated box... especially not with the rule booklets which are a cacophony of colour and boxes and explanatory illustrations. But the game's character cannot be denied, really. 

I have been harbouring vague ideas to purchase a copy of my own, but the one thing staying my hand each time is the unergonomic graphical design. You need to be able to see what other players are up to, but the artwork is so fluffy and detailed that it gets in the way of a quick and clear view. The game gets one point deduction for this. It is a bloody shame that this is even necessary: the game would have been perfectly servicable with simpler drawings, but apparently someone at the publishing company was so glad to be able to issue a game from the Dynamic Duo again that he or she forgot that the main purpose of a game is to be [i]played[/i], and not to be looked at. For the time being I'll join in games when asked, with a little trepidation as to the graphics, though.

Components: Fun artwork on the buildings and board.

Experience: There really isn't too much going on in this game, but to me it seems like there is. There's the bargain hunting at the resource wheel. The choice of which buildings to build, and where to build them. And then what to score, and competing to score cities first. That's a lot of efficiency and timing to try to master.

Interesting, but so far I wouldn't say I particularly like it.

I've ordered the German language version from Amazon.de and it should be fine with English language paste-ups for the cards.

In The Palaces of Carrara, players want to buy the marble from this famous region of Italy as cheaply as possible – but any reduction in price will benefit opponents as well. Maybe you'll find it profitable to instead invest in the buildings created from this marble? Maybe it'll be more worthwhile to grab the expensive raw material when bigger buildings in town turn out to be not so lucrative?

Difficult game to rate. The expansion module that comes with the game certainly makes the game more replayable, but one or two of the multiplier tiles in that expansion seem excessively powerful. The game turns into a contest to get those tiles and then, if you lose out, to minimize their impact. Fortunately, the play is just fine when you leave out those tiles and use just the expansion cards and buildings.

It is a game without phases, it is just action, action, action, and I love that... and there are only 3 actions available, so clean and elegant. But only played with 2 players. The game has no scaling mechanism a setup so I I wonder how it would play with 4 player... it can get quite tight and frustrating I guess.

[b][FirstPlayOn23rdApril2014][/b] This game hits all my expectations. A medium light game with simple rules, a bit of engine building and a very unique gameplay. 

The market mechanic is simple and nothing that interests me. The decision to whether rotate the market wheel before purchase is critical, so to not give the next player a cheaper cost.

One of the critical thing in the game is to decide which city do you plan to build your building. Different cities have different way of scoring, either rewards you by points or by money. In addition, these cities have different limitations to what kind of coloured material you need to use to build them. The extreme right city on your player boards accept all colours and as you view each city to the left, they accept one less colour (there are 6 coloured materials in the game, so the last city - the extreme left, only accept white material, which is the most expensive material. It's harder to build here but rewards higher VP).

The best thing to admire about Carrara is how the end game works. In every advanced game, there will be three different conditions that each player need to match for you to announce the game has ended. This is a very cool mechanic as to make the game different every time. Some of the end game could be challenging and certainly changes the gameplay and the strategy of the game. Although you've met all three conditions, as long as you do not announce you've met them, the game will still continue (money and the building markers are kept hidden behind your screen, and these two could be the end game condition, so no player knows). Focusing and working your way towards these end game are really important. This is to avoid a sudden end game where you're not ready for it to happen.

Nekem nagyon bejött.
Ma próbáltuk.
Az alapjáték szerintem nem bonyolult, bár összetett, sok felé figyelős. (Meg mondjuk az sokat számít, ha nem a befejezés után az értékeléskor jut eszünkbe, h a befejezőnek jár 5 pont, akkor másképp csinálom az utolsó köröm :-), no de ez már más kérdés)
Szóval nem érzem azt, h nem lehetne egyből a kieggel kezdeni profi játékosok esetén. (Ugyanis sok helyen kihangsúlyozzák, h mindenképp az alapjátékkal kezd, minimum 2x játssz úgy, mielőtt a profi verziót használnád. Sőt, ugye lezárt borítékban az advanced verzió elemei, és a szabálya)
DE tényleg elég sokfelé figyelős, tehát van értelme csak az alapjátékkal kezdeni.
Lacival 1 pont különbséggel végeztünk az első 2 helyen.
Ami jó az alapjátékban: bár sok felé figyelős, de kezdőknek is lehet élvezetes. Mi ugyanis 2 teljesen kezdővel játszottunk -kezdő: akkor léptek be, és kérdezték, h megy ez a játékklub, és Catant már játszottak, mi meg bevettük őket -. És bár nyilván a taktikázás részei, a komolyabb stratégia minden lépése nem ment nekik, de ügyesen próbálgatták, és voltak jó mozgásaik/lépéseik. És úgy tűnt, h tetszett nekik a játék
(Ugyan Laci maradt még, és ő beszélt még velük, talán még játszottak is, nekem ment a hévem sajnos, aztán majd ő megerősít v cáfol)
Szóval meggyőző volt. ÉS! ami szinte hihetetlen, de 2 kezdővel is simán hoztuk a 60 percet játék időben.
Szóval úgy látom, h minden csoportnak lehet benne érdekes, és a kieg résszel meg aztán még hm, izgalmasabbá, profibbá válik a játék -legalábbis a szabály alapján-.
Amúgy szerintem kinézetre is szép, jól összerakottnak tűnt.
Az alapjátéka alapján játékerősség, súly vagy mi a BGG-s neve, kisebb mint a Tzolkiné, de a kieggel szerintem egy szinten van vele.
A szabálya, részletes, logikus, jól felépített -kicsit talán, legalábbis profiknak - túl magyarázottnak tűnik, az oldalszám meg elriaszthat kezdőket, de sok helyen írják, jó ez spec eset el se olvasd, csak ha belefutsz.
Én -tudom hülyeség ilyen kis játékmennyiség próba után- nem lepődnék meg, ha a jövő évi játékdíjasok közt szerepelne.
Azt kell mondjam Kramer -és persze párja Kiesling- még mindig nagyon tud, remélem még sok játékot terveznek majd.
A játék:
Márványt vásárolunk, és ezekből építjük a városok épületeit.
3 akció (1 körben ezek egyikét lehet választani):
1. vásárlás (korongcikkeken az áruk, a korong forog, így csökken a különböző színű márványok ára)
2. Építés: 6 féle épület az egyes épülete típusokon belül 1-5 értékben. A játékos dönti el, h melyik városba építi meg, de fontos, h az egyes városokban más-más márványokból lehet megépíteni.
3. értékelés: vagy épülettípus értékelés -ezt mindenki megteheti, saját játéktáblán megy- vagy város értékelés, de ezt 1 játékos teheti meg, és előfeltétele, hogy adott városban adott mennyiségű épülete legyen.
A játék vége: vagy ha elfogynak az épületek vagy ha  a 3 különböző feltétel mindegyikét teljesítette a játékos, és bejelenti h kész. A forduló még végig megy.
Update: a bővített verzió is kiváló: alapvetően nem sokat változik, de mégis. Az h a nyersanyag lelőhelyen lehet úgyis, h nem forgatsz, nem töltesz fel, az nem nagy vált, de hasznos. Az már nagyobb, h vannak külön 8-as épületek is, és h lehet épületet upgradelni, bármilyet bármilyenre, csak nagyobb értékű legyen, no és ha 8-as építünk meg/vagy upgradelünk vele, akkor bónuszt is kapunk, amivel városaink tudjuk erősíteni.
És a legfontosabb varia: a kártyák: ezek egyrészt ugye a 3 alap feltételt variálják meg jelentősen /húzással, szóval bmilyen kombó lehet/ másrészt a bónuszkártya plusz elem benne. 
Szóval igencsak tágul a lehetőség, és a végcélok miatt a taktika sem mindig azonos.
Nagyon jó!!!

A rondel resource collection game that turns into a rush for VP scoring. Very strategic with two players as a tough decision on when to buy resources and when to build with them is made. The resource rondel provides interesting flow to the gameplay. Seems very difficult for new players to understand but there is so much potential for a top notch game here.

Carrara is another Kiesling and Kramer rondel pricing, tile laying game. There are very few similarities between the two games other than what's said in the previous sentence. Carrara was one of the first games (that I recall) that during setup, had players mix up various objectives so that each game plays differently. Think Yokohama, Grand Austria Hotel, and Isle of Skye. This is very much a race game. Race to get upgrade tiles you want, the building materials you need, get the buildings that provide certain objects that are in limited supply, score certain cities, and end the game. One of the unique things about the game is that players can invoke scoring as their action for their turn and when they do, only they score. This is very different than most games and can lead to quite a disparity in the end game scores. The game includes an expansion in the box. Some people feel you should dive right into the advanced game, while others feel you should fully explore the base game first. Given how often people typically play games, I'd recommend the full game. It definitely offers players more choices and variability from game-to-game. In the end, this is a quick playing euro that's pretty easy to teach, has a lot of variability, and offers players a lot of choices. That said, I wouldn't recommend the OOP prices. Just play a friend's copy or on yukata.de. Maybe someday it will get reprinted.

Upon additional plays, it seems as though the Red City upgrade that you can acquire when you build an 8 building is OP. I say this because the only thing that provides as much VP is the white city, and the white bricks are just so much harder to acquire at a reasonable price. You can acquire red, white, and yellows,  to build up in the red city if you get this upgrade. It's not as big an issue if most players know this and can help combat it. That said, it will make play less interesting and in a multiplayer game, who's going to be the one to reign in the Red City upgrade player? Would they be shooting themselves in the foot while other players pursue different avenues? It may be worth playing this with the advance rules, but remove all the scoring upgrade tiles. I'd like to test that. The rest of the game is solid, and would probably be a 7 or 8 without this imbalance.

Reminiscent of Vikings with a market wheel, branching tiles from personal player boards, bonus tiles that enhance your score, and an overall puzzley feel to gameplay, yet one that feels distinct enough to secure a permanent place in my collection.

[b]Rating based on - 5 plays, 2 player[/b]
A rondel based economic game where you do one of 3 actions on your turn – buy blocks, build buildings (not necessarily palaces), or score one of the categories of buldings or a city – in order to get the most points by game end which happens either when all 30 buildings are built or one player calls it after having completed 3 objectives. The game is interesting and plays quite smoothly and quickly. The rules are simple, but the decisions are meaningful. I love the high level of tension during the game from deciding whether to build or to take blocks, whether to buy blocks knowing that you'd make other blocks cheaper for your opponent or to wait them out and let them make it cheaper for you. You're also hoping that the other player doesn't take the buildings you are going for, or score before you do and collect precious objects. In that way it definitely feels like a race. SO many options for variety – variable goal cards, multiple scoring paths, the available building tiles and blocks on the market and the order in which they come out. High quality components and a great rulebook that's chock full of examples. Artwork is so-so – very muted in some spots, brilliantly coloured in others…not my particular style or preference but the graphics are clear and functional. Very high quality components.

The beginning of the game is very slow because you each only start with one brick so you have to buy, buy, buy in the early  rounds and then you have to save up to build so it can be a bit dull and repetitive. It can also be tedious making sure exactly 11 blocks are on the market. Turns are super quick though. It gets just a little bit slower when you actually have a decent number of buildings and you are considering scoring. The crux of the game is the timing of the scoring as you can only score 6 times and you control what and when you score, and you have to balance that against wanting to build more and get more coins or points, and also what your opponent is scoring and what objectives they may achieve before you do. The cities on the main game board are open to be grabbed for scoring by any player, but once they have been scored by one player, nobody else can score there.

The first play of this left me with mixed feelings afterward. I was simultaneously interested during the game, yet a bit underwhelmed afterward, and with such fierce competition the first time we played it ([thing=206941][/thing] springs to mind) it never really got a look in and was only played once. We've played it 4 more times this month but it doesn't really gel with either of us. I'd say the biggest negative against it is that the abrupt ending can leave you feeling very unsatisfied. You were planning to build one more building then score and all of a sudden somebody does their turn, scores big, announces the end of the game and you are 100 points behind with no way to catch up. *shrug* In general we like it fine, but we own other rondel games and other Euros that we like way better. It just doesn't stand out enough to get played very often.

(Rating also based on 10+ asynch online plays on Yucata.de [microbadge=19345])

Only played the base version without the included expansion so far.

Very streamlined get-resources-and-turn-them-into-victory-points game with a set collection aspect. You build buildings, but they don't do anything other than to give you gold and points. No special powers. No theme.

I doubt that the included expansion would change my opinion by much because all it does is add new scoring conditions.

RATING: 7.5
If I started this comment with “This game feels like it came out in 2003 not 2013” you’d probably think it was going to be negative, but far from it: this game is great despite feeling old school. It’s a mechanically simple game with a push-your-luck element in how you score. Anyone can build a large VP tableau but the player who scores his most will win. It’s harder than it sounds to resist the temptation to build “just one more” building to score. It’s that race to score design element that makes elevates the game to an interesting sprint for VPs -- how long do you load your gun before you fire all the bullets?
 
There’s an interesting market mechanism whereby (using the advanced rules here) you can turn the wheel or not depending on how much it hurts  you vs hurts your opponents. This choice makes for interesting market purchase decisions and infuses the game’s scoring race with a purchasing race; basically, there’s tension all around that should keep this game fresh.

Played as a 3p game and it was very frustrating. Whatever action I chose, the other two players did the same, so each turn, I was looking at the same bricks for the same prices. I did OK in the game, it became easier to make decisions as the game was easier to read with experience. It was enjoyable enough for what it was, but it was frustrating. Faced with no actual choice beyond the bleedin obvious for round after round, it lacked joy.

But that may have been a condition of the 3 player game, with smart players making optimal moves each turn. With 4 players, there might be a step change in the decisions taken, which might give the game some life. But that's what it lacked, any spark of life.

After reading the rules I was disappointed. I like many of the K&K designs, and I was hoping for something to go along with those old favourites. That first read, however, made it sound old-fashioned, even dated in more ways than I cared for. Standard resource conversion with the same old renaissance builders theme, blah. It sat on the shelve for almost a year after that.

In the eventual first play, however, the game showed what I had missed when reading the rules. Erecting the buildings is indeed nothing out of the ordinary but the sole driving factor behind every decision in the game are the end game conditions. All the talk of collecting marble and the king inspecting the progress of the construction work is merely fluff for the players wrestling for control of the game pacing. Timing is everything, and being caught on the wrong foot can easily lead to dramatic differences in scoring. It also makes many of the decisions more interesting than typical in this context. Getting valuable resources for cheap is not automatically a no-brainer. Can you really spare that action and delay scoring for yet another round? I'm intrigued.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The shine wore off this one - while the endgame conditions theoretically give replayability it seems it's often better just to play for points and bulldoze the opposition that way. The way the marble market operates means that there seems to be quite the advantage to sitting in turn order after new players and it's surprisingly difficult to gracefully explain as well. I was so excited by this the first time I played it but having played it as part of the 10x10 challenge it just seems to have fallen to pieces and it feels like a bit of a sad slog to retread the same basic strategy now. I don't think I ever want to play it again.

Kiesling/Kramer ist die Verkörperung der verlässlichen Solidität: nie wirklich schlecht, aber auch nie überragend. Der nette Herr Mainstream von nebenan. Auch CARRARA kommt zunächst in alten Euro-Klamotten daher, so dass sich das Grundspiel glatt und wenig prickelnd dahin langweilt. Die beiliegende Erweiterung jedoch macht CARRARA eigentlich erst zu einem richtigen Spiel - einem überdurchschnittlichen und unterschätzten sogar. CARRARA wirkt vordergründig wie ein Aufbauspiel, ist aber eigentlich ein taktischer Wettlauf. Das Preisrad ist originell und beinhaltet die Gefahr dem nachfolgenden Spieler stets eine Steilvorlage an billigen Bausteinen zu liefern. CARRARA fühlt sich durchaus eigen an, obwohl es auch ganz altbackene Aspekte hat. Im Kontext der variablen Schlusswertung bei kurzer, verdichteter Spielzeit ist CARRARA in seiner Unscheinbarkeit ein Spätwerk, das ich persönlich zu den besten in der umfassenden Werkschau von Kiesling/Kramer zähle. Der nette Herr Mainstream von nebenan hat sich seinen kleinen Palast im besseren Viertel der Spielestadt nicht ohne Grund erwirtschaftet.

I have wanted to play this ever since the English version was released a couple of years ago and I missed the opportunity to pick this up before it was quickly deleted.  I honestly didn't know what to expect, but I know that K&K never disappoint!  By the end, I was perhaps less impressed than I was hoping.  Certainly there is a very interesting game here with a sliding economic scale that I enjoy and a pretty solid underbelly to tie everything together. But I found the turns so slight that I never felt myself getting excited.  I went early in with spending most of my money to purchase a decent building and place it in a decent city.  For the next several rounds I then took one brick, one brick, one brick, two coins, one brick, etc. I believe there were really only three turns of mine where I was in the position to do something beyond the bare minimum. In the end, I actually won the game! I never saw that coming. I was quite a fascinating first play considering that I didn't really think I was going to win and then it turned out my investments early on paid off.  Overall, this is certainly a Euro to think about but it didn't win me over the first time around and it wasn't exciting enough to inspire towards playing it again soon.

Seems to have been inspired by Vikings, has a wheel that you keep 11 resources on and you can make the cost cheaper by turning the wheel but that usually helps everyone else as well so interesting choices.

I suggest to play it with advanced rules (expansion in envelope which comes in base game box). This makes game much more strategic engine building and increases game's replay value.

Explained why this game meant so much to us (lucca link) and managed to trade for a German copy. Game is pretty much language independant with the aid of a few print out crib sheets to explain cards/English rules. Have only played the basic game so far but have really enjoyed it and like the wheel and push your luck element with when to score mechanics - played 2 and 3 player so far and although 2 was enjoyable, 3 added that sense of uncertainty when hoping things would still be available by the time your turn came back around to me. Really nice game and shame this isn't more widely available in English but very happy with my German copy (trade was fantastic and feel a little bad as I didn't realise I was trading for a mint copy of the game as it had basically had the shrink wrap off and nothing else touched - thank you Matthew Dunstan!)

Rating after one game with basic rules. It's straightforward: 1. buy cubes on the market 2. build a building  3. score VP or get coins. Repeat this 4 times and the game is over (ok maybe you need to buy cubes twice because of lower costs). You get a cube cheaper than your fellow players = great / you build a certain building before another player = great / you score a city before your adversaries = great,  but that's all the game offers. It's just a lot of "been there, done that".
The most annoying is [i]how[/i] the game differs between basic game and expert game. The publisher put a sheet with extra rules, markers and cards in a sealed enveloppe and wrote on it: Don't open this before you have at least played the base game once or twice!
Are they kidding? Even the basic rules contains a warning not to play the expert variant right from the start. So what? The base game is (point of view experienced players) so bland, that they easily could play the advanced game rightaway. The expert mode only adds the possibility to upgrade an already built building, two additional scoring spots and some additional cards offering different game end conditions. That's all. It's just plain ridiculous that there are warnings (!) about the expert game in the rules.
I am willing to play again (with expert rules) but please dear publishers, [b]don't start patronizing me[/b].

What a surprise! This game is a gem, just about the right level of complexity and length. The three base actions are simple to grasp but become very meaningful as the game progresses. The "push your luck" nature of scoring is very tense, the material limits for the cities cleverly gate your decisions and the marketplace is brilliant. Every time you choose that action it moves forward, refills and the prices lower. There's a chance you'll be able to get some materials for free, but everything will be cheaper for your opponent as well.
A pleasure to play.

The "ends before you know it" pace is gripping, though it also means that you're punished for not mentally tracking what opponents have behind their screens. Still, the constant hard decisions and the clever brick-pricing mechanic, plus the variable setup (one goal that's mandatory but gives no points; one goal that gives points but isn't mandatory; and two that do both) make this sparkle enough for me.

(Also, I like how the large size of the available building pool creates texture; it can be dominated by expensive buildings, by cheap ones, by green in general, by a specific type, etc. If only 4 or 5 buildings were out at once, I think you might pick a strategy at the beginning and run with it. With 9 you have a strong reason to take availability into account.)

A light but shallow game. There is very little to do in it.

You either buy or build. I'd rather pass.

Replayability is minimal, since it's always the same thing game after game. Very little variety in the game. There should have been more to do.

I wouldn't buy this... and probably would trade/sell it away if I received it as a present, eventually.

RATING: 6
Very simple but elegant design. Especially taking resources is interesting, because if you decrease the cost for yourself, you also decrease costs for the other players. 

What i disliked about the game was that there were some rounds, where i wanted to do a lot and could only do one thing, and then there were a lot of rounds were i only fealt like having bad choices/no choice. But maybe with better planing ahead this gets better.

Another great game from Kramer/Kiesling that can easily catch up with their older games.

This game is about timing in many aspects and offers enough (indirect) player interaction to be interesting. It is a tense game where resources are somewhat scarce.

Given it isn't a spectacular game everyone should have seen, but it is a very solid game with a good  replayability.

RATING: 6
Decent game. Rating based only on online play, mostly 2p game and advanced game(i.e. w/ expansion) only. Same as Vikings, can't imagine playing another base game, I would probably give a 5.5 to the base game.

Share some similarities with [thing=27173][/thing]. I like both games, but Vikings is better for me.

Carrara is definitely good, but it has some minor problems too. Overall, it's more tactical than Vikings. Player will spend more timing thinking, since the competitions on both buying good cubes with good prices and scoring at a just right time are too crucial. I would say that they are slightly over dominating that some long-term planning aspects are actually diminished.

Also, I can imagine, if not playing online, The execution of supplying cubes, scoring VP/money.etc drags the game a little bit. 

I have a different opinion on fast game-ending. I consider it as the reflection on its tactical nature -- one just can not expect too much on long-term bid scores. Yes, game-ending is "abrupt" and that is not necessarily considered as weakness, just a feature, like it or not.

I came in last in my first 3 games, just couldn't grok how quickly the end game comes. Then something clicked and now I really like it. The game is really simple to teach, which is one of the things that drew me to it, but there's really a second level that it takes a game or so (or 3 for me) to get. Plays great with 2, 3, or 4.

I started with the advanced game from the start, but I think the basic game is fine, and I'd recommend it for new players.

In any case, this is the best K&K game years, I could see my rating going up, but I still have mixed feelings about the variable end game conditions. To wit, I usually dislike "solve the puzzle" games with this little interaction (e.g., Dominion, Kingdom Builder), but this just has something special. I read another user comment that this is the kind of game that Feld starts with but then adds tons of stuff, whereas this is much more clean and focused, so maybe that's what I'm liking.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (June 2016)

Wolfgang Kramer is a designer I respect a lot, however it seems I have been drifting away from the duo Kiesling-Kramer, because their games no longer excite me. The Palaces of Carrara is a boring game for me. Acquiring the game wasn’t easy or cheap, so I’m, somewhat, disappointed.

The rules are very easy to grasp, you can teach the game under 8 minutes. When a friend was explaining the game, I thought this was going to be a good game, but after playing it, I can say I didn’t have any fun (even though I won). Playtime is around 90 minutes. We played the advanced variant which isn’t very advanced or hard.

I heavily dislike that the advanced variant came in an envelope, the rules were very wrinkled :angry:.

The components are very well done. The art is ok.

The theme is paper thin, you don’t feel it anywhere. 

Although the decisions to play the game aren’t obvious, I found no tension through the game. I know you can block someone taking what he needs, but in this game it didn’t matter much. It is like the players play on automatic, you decide a path and you stick to the plan to the end. Timing is the most important aspect of the game. There are three general options, to get marble, to build or to call the “king” (or someone like him) to review your work. There is a memory element as players play with a shield, but even then I didn’t have much fun playing it. I feel the game is too homogenous, perhaps the decisions are too scripted and/or constrained.

With the cards, replayability is very high.

The luck factor is present, but controllable as even if you get the resources you need, they will be very expensive. I’m much more worried about king making with the resource wheel. The luck factor with the buildings is a bit higher, but again I feel it is manageable.

I like that a player can declare the game ending, making it a bit of a race to score.

Bottom line, I should love the game, but I don’t want to play it again anytime soon. The decisions, although far from being obvious, aren’t that interesting. I didn’t have much fun playing it and I was frustrated with it. Perhaps it is too mechanical and repetitive for me. If you are going to play the game, I suggest you begin with the advanced variant right away. I already sold my copy of the game. I prefer to play almost any other Euro game.

Current Rating: 5.0

RATING: 3
As soulless a Euro as I've seen in a while.  It's literally 1) buy blocks, 2) use blocks to build buildings, 3) score VPs for buildings.  Only interaction is racing others to resources/buildings first.  The rondel to determine resource prices is the only minimally positive aspect to the game.

RATING: 9
Another Kramer game where there are always more things that you want to do on your turn than there are actions available. 

Needs to be played a few more times, especially with the expansion... but my initial impression is a '9.'

RATING: 7.5
Not too heavy of a game, but a lot to consider.  The rondel that affects the cost of bricks is a cool mechanic.

I like that you can score on a variety of buildings or city types.  There's some strategy and contention for objects and scoring.

Wonderful that the expansion was added as part of the base box.  The additional (and varied) win conditions make for a lot of replayability.

Feels slightly soulless and mechanical.

I have only played this game two player and a handful of times. The game isn't bad but there is something about the game that bothers me. I think it's how quickly the game ends. The game starts just fine and I get invested in what's going on. But just at the game is getting going and the escalation begins to gain momentum the game ends. I'm left feeling like it is mid game and without warning. I don't look at what I have accomplished in front of me with satisfaction but rather disappointment that the game was over and I had only just got started. I'm not giving up on this game yet though.... I want to see how it plays with three or four... And maybe change my strategy. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I've only played the basic game about 5 times online, so I'm not sure my opinion of the game is completely fair. The rules are simple and the strategy is easy to grasp. I think the game might be just a little too light for me. There were too many turns where I felt like I didn't have any decent options. I do think the advanced game might be a bit better, and I think it's at least possible that playing in person would improve the irritation I would feel with those turns that offered limited options.

Everything in Palaces of Carrara is screaming "old-fashioned". Gaining most prestige in renaissance Italy, buying resources and transforming them to money or VP's, a resource wheel that the co-author took from Vikings. The most unusual parts are Tribune-like game end conditions coupled with Kingdom Builder-like end scoring and the possibility to choose intermediate scoring as an action.
But it shows what experienced authors and solid development are worth. Palaces moves along at a good pace, offers many interesting decisions and the sum is more than the parts. The challenge is timing/preparing for the variable game end strategically, while using short-term opportunities and watching what opponents are up for to possibly thwart their plans by grabbing what they want first. With its simple structure of taking one action out of three possibilities it fits perfectly into my comfort zone of streamlined eurogames.
Experienced players can jump directly into the advanced game although I would recommend to use one of the proposed game end card combinations first to avoid possible freak constellations resulting in overly short / long games.

My most beloved Kramer/Kiesling game. Just take cubes or build a building, and get coins or victory points for it - that's it on the surcface and with that it's a nice family game. Then comes the expanded (full) version which really builds up on the solid base. Set collection with 3 different type of sets (objects, building, building type) and still adding complexity to the scoring machine (enhancing tiles, reconstruction), an insanious amount of replayability due to the different condition and scoring cards... it's ... insane.

Played two dozen games now offline/online and still it amazes me how well the game plays out each time...

Very good game where you buy brick from a mancala and then use said bricks to build stuff in cities. Also, bah for having to 'waste' buildings to get money xD

Very good.  The decisions about when to score are innovative.  I'm a bit surprised that they have some end-game scoring that does not require you to take a turn to score; this seems to weaken the austere self-determination that the novel decide-when-to-score-yourself mechanism introduces.  8.  Maybe higher.  I do want to play again and buy it.

Straightfoward eurogame with different ways to scoring in the end of the game. Do not play the vanilla version if you are a seasoned gamer, it is just too boring. I guess I got now the style of Kiesling and Kramer, all well designed games but not enough meat. Also, too much points in the end game scoring, more than double the in-game scoring.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
From Kramer and Kiesling (designers of El Grande), this is a very tight Euro where you never have enough turns or resources to do everything you want to do. You are collecting marble to build cities but the key is that each city can only be scored once by any player, so it's a race to meet the requirements to score those cities. The variable end game conditions is a nice addition to and adds to the replay value. And ... I am a sucker for games with a wheel.

Received from Amazon.de.  Feels like a streamlined versions of Vikings in many ways.  Game starts slow as we all need to built up our reserve of building bricks.

Tension is there from the moment you start the game regardless of the number of players.

This was a big hit with Alain. I thought it was good and Gust who didn't do to well had nothing to say.
the spinning wheel with resources was a nice mechanic and the variability of  the end conditions in the advanced game means that different strategies have to be excecuted or so it seems from a first play.
I don't like this quite as much as skye, quadropolis or broom service and I believe these games have the same target audience.

The reason why I don't think it is that good is mainly because you are planning to end the game from pretty early on.  Because of that you lose the development of your cities that skye and quadrapolis do have.
I do like the end game conditions but these can be hard on the start player if he wasn't paying attention.

Another thing that was apparent is the blocking by scoring cities. You prevent the other players to score a tile (building) two times by doing so.

All in all because of the advanced game this is a really decent game to have in a small collection. 
But I would opt for Ticket to ride and skye instead.

Easy to get into it "old school euro-game". You really should skip the basic game and go directly to the Advanced game because there is all the meat you'll get: in every game different kind of goals which means, that you need to play it different way and focus on different things. Just great! And the length? It's just optimal: not too short or too long compared to what you get... sometimes the game is over even sooner than you expected, but that's just something you need to focus and be prepared: what others are doing, are we almost in the end or is there couple of more rounds or what?
I really recommend this game!

Relatively simple rules, lots of different aims to focus on. A good-looking brain-burner where timing is everything. Kramer-Kiesling still means quality after so many years.
I think it's good but it becomes great once the advanced rules start to take effect, especially when you have confronting scoring aims/endgame triggers. I especially like the nature of the game: it starts calm, simple, and as time goes by it gets more and more tense. I love tension in games!

Went directly to the advanced game and found an interesting game.  Pacing is something everyone has to watch as the game can end quite suddenly if you aren't paying attention to game end conditions and how close people are to fulfilling said condition.  The brick acquisition wheel is a good mechanism - you often want to turn it to make your bricks cheaper but then that makes everyone else's bricks cheaper in future turns.  In the advanced game, different scoring objectives will change how each game plays out as the focuses will change.  

Don't be afraid to purchase the German version - the only language issue is the special cards in the advanced game but the English rules available here on BGG list out what each one does.

I'm not entirely sure what to think about this one. It's a totally abstract game with the thinnest of thematic veneers and the turny wheel thing isn't as elegant as the dice windrose mechanic in Macao, but the timing of actions, the variability and tough decisions all make this a surprise hit with me. I'll start with a 7 rating and see where it goes.

This game has a small learning "ramp"... if you never played it, you'll probably lose the first time you play it. This makes it a bit less interesting compared to "Ticket to ride" or "Carcassonne", but it's a good step after those. I find it a bit slow and repetitive in the beginning, although that could be because I haven't had the chance to get a group of people trained enough to include all the advanced rules. I like it, but I find it a bit hard to find a group to play with.

One advice: the main noob killer is the lack of money during mid-game (they usually don't get the importance of money the first time they play), so I would advice to play with the advanced side of the individual player board. So at least they have another way to get money through orange/city buildings.

At first glance, Palaces of Carrara looks like the sort of thing I'm tired of: get cubes, build buildings, score VPs, some gizmo in the middle to make it "fresh". At second glance it's pretty much that as well. In fact, there's no mystery here: it's that kind of game. Nevertheless, this didn't feel like the same kind of grind as Tzol'kin or Village or Keyflower. For one thing, it plays pretty speedily, and turns go by fast, so you don't have a whole lot of time to have to try and imagine that what you're doing is anything other than moving bits around in a game. There's nothing here I'm clamoring for, but I'd much rather play it than most other Euros of this type.

Play with the advanced rules; they make the game better.

The turning wheel with resources is amazing!
With two players the game becomes more tactically than with four players. What will you be leaving for your opponent? And what will be available for you afterwards?

The win conditions are a bit severe though, with more options and possibilities the game would be better. I miss a little in-game depth, but it makes it accessible to more players, so the game hits the table more often :)

When there's a piece of board attached to the larger board, you know its going to be the hallmark gimmick of the game.  Fortunately, the lazy susan of shopping is not just a gimmick in this game, but is actually pretty fun.  An odd push-your-luck meets resource evaluation type thing.  Unfortunately, the rest of the game falls a little flat.  Serviceable, but flat.

Buy stones to build buildings. Sounds simple. The game has a "family" version, and an "expert extension" that provides more options and depth.

Just like a lot of games these days, it comes with a "turning wheel" that mimmic the free market where stones that are not so popular become cheaper over time. 

Disappointments during playing (with extension):
- The game stopped way too early because of end conditions that were to easy to reach.
- "broken" end game (with 2 players). After performing all scoring, game took another hour, just to get all these buildings built, so that the game could end (other ending conditions were no longer reachable).
- game without extension is a bit too simple

Minus: 2 - 3 (excitement, duration) - 6 - 8 (broken end game, game too simple without extension)

You only have a choice of 1 of 3 actions during your turn.

a) Buy bricks at various prices based on their location in the market.

b) Use those bricks to construct buildings of various sizes.

c) Have the King visit your cities and gain VPs or Money while he visits.

That's it...

But beneath those simple mechanics lies a game of utmost subtlety and beauty.
A must play!

RATING: 7
Best part of the game is the timing mechanisms - deciding if and when to score a region, and deciding whether to rotate the wheel or to stall. Worst part of the game is the end game cards/bonuses. It seems as though the timing of the end game and the scores achieved will vary wildly based on which cards appear. I suppose that for some this will be a perk but to me it seemed to take a potentially elegant game and make it too convoluted. As my first play was with two players, my opinion may differ with a higher play count.

Update: I don't get Carrara. Why do I always lose? It's almost a luckless game. Not a game that super-grabs me, but as long as I don't know how to win it, it intrigues me enough to play it every now and then. Recently played the advanced version. It offers more variation, but I lost even bigger.

Very enjoyable game. Quite simple, but plenty of interaction. Aiming to buy the resources the cheapest, then there is a race to get points for the city, which for each city only one player can do and there is a race to grab and build the affordable buildings. I am looking forward to the advanced game.

Rating based on basic version: Pretty but dull. By bricks from the rotating market. Then build with those bricks and score cities or building types. Very dependent on timing as only one person can score in each city. There's really a bit of a race because if you can get your scoring started before everyone else, and trigger the end, you'll probably win over those trying to put together larger scores opportunities but not getting a chance to pull the trigger. Don't be that person!

I enjoy K&K's newer stuff much more than their older stuff. Hard to say if I like this one more than Coal Baron.

I first played the base version as advised in the rules. I was dissapointed, it was too simple. After playing the advanced game a couple of times I love this game! This game is old school, few rules and a lot of depth. I like the wheel and the building blocks look nice. It makes for an interesting market. The buidings are a bit of a race to make sure you can invite the king first to get the most gold and VP. The game is over quick, about an hour and plays well with all player counts. The different cards that trigger the end of the game and the end of game scoring keep this game fresh. It really does make you play a different way every time. Excellent game that is already a classic for me.

Decent enough game, light-weight but fun enough, typical for Kramer and Kiesling - similar in depth to Asara. 

Downsides:
- themeless 
- the ending is swingy - better to play a complete round at the end, like in TtA
- the mission cards force the players to play in one way, sometimes even ignoring certain aspects (buildings) altogether - poor design, that part

On the surface, this seems like it's "just another Euro", but hiding underneath that surface is a much deeper game with a deceptively unforgiving edge. The key to this how the players drive the scoring and endgame based on the particular objective cards available in each game. If you don't pay attention to how other players are advancing in the game, you can easily find yourself completely out of the running with the end arriving much sooner than you anticipated.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's your typical, generic eurogame in every way save one: the scoring conditions AND endgame conditions change every play based on 4 cards dealt at random. The players determine when the game ends, making it partly a race game. Tempo is very important, and this adds a whole new and important element. You can't play it like other euros, ignoring your opponents and focusing solely on efficiency. You must keep an eye on when the game might end.

I have had only one play of The Palaces of Carrara, but really enjoyed it. This simple game offers some pretty interesting decisions such as when to conduct your scoring. Go too early and you ay have missed your chance to maximise your points, go too late and someone else may have grabbed to points.

This is a very well designed game that offers some interesting gameplay and some very nice pieces. I’d play this again in an instant and would consider purchasing if the price was right.

An interesting map and really nice production values make this game of area control well worth trying. I like the pieces and the way the game plays. It may be a tad ‘over produced’ for what it is, but the gameplay itself is rather fun and I think it probably has great replayability.

One I’d play again and consider for purchase. Actually, a smaller box to be able to take to work and play at lunchtime would tip this from as ‘possible’ to ‘probable’ purchase.

Kind of a dry, abstract game despite the handsome, colourful artwork and the fun wheel-turning mechanism. It's got a lot of interesting things about it--notably the unusual scoring mechanism and game-end trigger--but in the end it's one of those annoying passive-aggressive games where you're mostly just competing indirectly by scooping up resources (buildings and blocks) and beating your opponent to scoring cities. YMMV.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.25
This is a wonderful game. It has the typical Euro-style collect-resources-to-build-buildings aspect, but it has two very cool features which make the game feel fresh:

1) Variable end-game conditions, and
2) Scoring points requires an action, rather than something that happens passively as a result of other actions.

Those 2 make the game. The game's rating on BGG is pretty good, but I'm quite surprised it's not higher. I wonder if a lot of people only played the 'basic' game (i.e., without the envelope contents) and thus didn't find the game to be particularly impressive.

On the surface this seems like a resource management game. However, the game focuses much more on set collection and scoring at the right time.

The components and game play are fantastic.

The Palaces of Carrara looks like a peaceful building game but it's actually a cutthroat economy game. Colored blocks are available on a rondel where the prices fall each time the rondel turns but if you wait too long, someone else may snatch those blocks you had your eyes on. The more expensive blocks you get, the more impressive buildings you may erect, but should you go for money buildings to finance the next build or victory point buildings for victory? Should you collect similar buildings or buildings in the same city? And when is the right time to score your buildings?

At first I wasn't sure how different each game would be but the more I've played The Palaces of Carrara, the more I've come to appreciate the elegance and depth of this unique masterpiece. This is a highly interactive game where you must constantly adapt your strategy and tactics to the ever changing conditions of the board - just what a perfect game should like. Unlike many other reviewers, I think the base game is good on its own, but the variable objectives and upgrade options of the expansion game add even further challenges.

A pretty straight forward game, even with the added difficulty from the so-called "expansion". Turns are very fast as you only need to do one action a turn, with the tension of fighting for scoring and objects make it a pretty exciting and competitive game. 

There is nothing new here, nor do I think the game is very replayable (even with different objectives every games), but at its weight, playing time, and fun there aren't many games that could get better than this.

RATING: 6.5
On a wheel with increasing cost, colored cubes of six different colors are randomly seeded onto the wheel. Players may choose to buy from one section of the wheel. White cubes generally cost the most, black cubes are the cheapest.  Using the bought cubes, players may construct buildings into 6 different districts; the highest VP district only accepts white cubes for payment. The different districts require different colors to build.

The districts, when scored, give the player a combination of money or VPs. Scoring is a separate action, and you can only score a city once.

It's an okay game, but I worry there isn't too much variety in that there is really only one way to progress your game. I think the interesting decisions in the game are do you purchase buildings in expensive districts, or do you go the cheap route? Both ways will work. There is some tension in that you want to have some cities built up before other players to score them, but you can see that happening. So there are some tough decisions, and it plays okay, but it isn't a top tier game. There is a racing aspect to it as you want to be the first player to score your buildings, or score cities to deny other people, and I'm not overly fond of racing games.

I don't mind it so much, but if you are the kind of player who gets irritated by the need to pay a lot of attention to what your turn sets up for the next person's turn, then you are going to loathe this game.

Really enjoyed this game.  Different colored cubes are available for pick-up with a pretty unique wheel that you move every turn so that newer blocks are expensive, and blocks that everyone had a turn to pick clean are cheaper.

You also will be building in different cities depending on the color cubes you have.  The rarer the cubes, the better buildings you can build.  The buildings do not have any real 'special abilities' persay, but they will give you money or points.  

This is quite a good, easy to pick-up game...after you have scored a translation of the rules, anyway.

RATING: 6
nice simple game, I would only play the advanced version. there are three actions to choose from: buy colored tiles for money; build 'town' or 'village' buildings in six different cities for colored tiles - tile color determines where you are allowed to build; score buildings, by scoring a city, or towns, or villages or one of six symbols associated with the different buildings. scores depend on the numerical value of the scored buildings and the values of the city where the building was built.
there are three variable game end conditions coupled with special scoring opportunities in each game. whenever a player announces that he fulfilled the conditions, the game ends at the end of the round. 
this simple and ingenious little rule makes the game sufficiently short and enjoyable. there is also a final scoring.

Lots of game ending point-counting and high scores.  This one needs more play to determine if it's an issue.

RATING: 6
Very bland looks, and the gameplay pretty much matches the visuals: Buy bricks with money, buy buildings with bricks, or score buildings to earn money and points. There are some timing aspects to consider, and the brick conveyor belt is a novel enough idea, but mostly the game just feels unengaging.

Family game: It's very surprising for a family game that screwing up your money production for the entire game during the first rounds is extremely easy. The complete lack of set collection points for the wooden scoring tokens is a disappointment.

Advanced game: Adds a variable setup where end conditions and end scoring rules are drawn from a deck of cards. These variable rules make the wooden tokens more interesting but also influence building choices (where, what, how many) heavily. Also adds some complexity by allowing replacing buildings with more expensive ones. These additions do not quite compensate for the fact that the core gameplay just isn't interesting enough.

Comes in the oversized box previously seen in Pantheon and Stone Age.

Ad ogni turno ogni giocatore dovrà scegliere una delle tre azioni a disposizione prestando attenzione a quali sono le richieste (carte obiettivo) delle partita in corso. Elegante e strategico gioco, per poter primeggiare si dovrà seguire una buona pianificazione anche se l'estrazione dei marmi migliori e più costosi, degli edifici o la forte interazione con gli altri giocatori potrebbe complicare i propri piani.

[b]The Palaces of Carrara[/b] [i]I was finally able to get an English copy to replace my German one (6/15/15)[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]- Plays great with 2.
- This is one of those perfect mid weight Euro's that plays in under an hour and can easily be enjoyed by my family. 
- I enjoy the tension created each turn by having to decide between building with the blocks you have or buying more bricks from the wheel.
- You also have to balance scoring points versus earning more money (to buy bricks) when deciding which cities to build buildings in.
- The end game is not static; you may (but you don't have to) declare the end of the game when you have meet certain scoring/building requirements.
- The alternative scoring cards can dramatically change the flow of the game. Sometimes it is an absolute sprint to the finish because the end game triggers are easy to reach, while at other times you have more time to build a better engine. I love how no 2 games feel the same once you introduce those cards.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8.5):[/COLOR]

[i]We first played on a family game night with my wife and 2 older kids (11 and 8). I was not sure if the theme would appeal to them, but it did. They both enjoyed collecting the marble bricks and then building buildings with them. My daughter (8) has mainly focused on the inexpensive buildings, but has done quite well. My son (11) has been trying out different strategies to find one that suits him (this usually involves getting lots of money which doesn't always help in this game).

We played the first few games with the base rules plus the advanced side of the board, which lets you score green buildings for vp and yellow buildings for $. The last few games we have included the 8 buildings and upgrade tiles, we have yet to use the alternative scoring cards. The 8 buildings really help the game become more tactical, you have to decide on which tile upgrade you want and how best to get it. You may build it in a town you don't plan on scoring just to get that upgrade tile for a different city. I also like that you can upgrade buildings by paying the difference in marble pieces.

My kids both like it, right now my this is my daughter's favorite game but that is constantly changing. She can hold her own, she hasn't won yet but she has come in second a few times. I love this game, I love the theme, the mechanics and all of the beautiful wooden bits. I enjoy the resource management; having to decide when to build with the blocks you have is never easy you always want one more brick. We all like how the end game scoring works; you may (you don't have to) declare the end of the game when you have meet certain scoring/building requirements. 

This game plays well with 2,3 and 4 players. A definite recommendation for a family Euro game with a good amount of strategy to be found.[/i]

Picking up where Vikings left off mechanically and then applying a different stereotyped theme to it. Once you get into it, it's a solid 60 min Euro. Collect stones off the wheel (prices gradually drop on unwanted stones), and build buildings. The first decision is in which of the 6 cities you want to build (preferably different to other people), and the cities with the best payoffs require the most expensive stones. You'll want both a money-payoff city (to fuel further purchases) and VP-payoff cities. The other major decisions are when to spend actions to collect the money and VP payoffs - you'll want to minimise the number of times you do this, so you'll want to do it near the end to get maximum payoff, but if you do it too close to the end, then someone may end the game before you're finished and you'll have missed out on collecting VPs along the way, which is a killer. So you need to keep a very wary eye on exactly how each of the other players are progressing towards completing the game-end conditions. Turns are fast, the decisions are nice without being paralyzing. It's not as good as Vikings because of the required wari-ness and the negative feelings associated with missing out on points, but it's still very solid, easy to teach, and interesting to play.

Another great use of the rondel!  Another unique way of placing tiles!  And the best part is the unique way in which you pick where/what you want to score, and WHEN you want to score!  But sometimes, your opponents beat you to the punch.  It's all about timing.  And the players decide when the game is over, as long as you meet the requirements for calling the end of the game.  And the rules when playing with the expansion (provided with the base game) make the game even better!  The cards provide so much variability to every game.  Being able to buy tiles that cost 8 and earning a bonus tile for doing so, helps you create your strategy.  Love this one a lot!

Very good, but very euro. It's mostly language independent, but it does require a few look ups in the rulebook until you understand what each scoring card means. Looking forward to more plays of it.

Quick rules summary so I don't have to keep looking at the rules:

Each turn consists of 3 possible actions:

Wheel Action
1. Choose to rotate wheel
2. Refill to 11 cubes if rotated
3. Must buy at least one cube

Build Building Action
1. Build a building from available tiles
2. Place above player board
3. Pay resources according to city built in
4. You may optionally upgrade a building instead, pay the difference and if you built an 8 cost building, gain upgrade tile

Score Buildings
1. Choose scoring option
2. Score = number of buildings and gain money/vp/building objects
3. Mark off with scoring token

End Game = 3 Scoring Objectives completed by 1 player or 30 buildings built. Complete equal number of turns.

This was an enjoyable game, like a cross between Vikings and Glen More.  I liked the resource wheel with manipulation of the block prices.  I liked the various random scoring opportunities and game end conditions.  There's a lot of subtle indirect competition with your peers.

Very simple, yet cutthroat building game. The key is in the timing of scoring and triggering the endgame.  If you don't pay attention to what your opponents are doing, you can have lots of prime scoring opportunities ripped away. In our second game my partner tried to get a big engine going for cash, so I scored lots of small buildings quickly and ended the game before she was even on the board.  I like it, but I suspect it is too cutthroat for play with my family and too light for the game group.

Another annoying "abstract with a theme" that some of my friends seem to like.
I guess that I didn't get how the victory points worked with the rest of the game.

I think my problem is that adding rules to a thematic game can add depth of theme and enjoyment because the extra rules make sense but adding rules to an abstract just add confusion and leave me wondering if I should waste everyone's time by asking the someone to explain all the rules and interactions again.

If I played this many times then I would probably get it and might even like it but I'm not going to play it several times, so never playing again would be wonderful.

Another easy-playing but deceptively deep Euro from the veritable masters of such games, Kramer & Kiesling, which would surely be more widely appreciated if the distribution of the English language version hadn't been so appallingly mishandled. Theme is never the most important part of a Euro but this has a nice one which comes though pretty well in gameplay. Needless to say with a K&K game, the mechanisms are smooth as silk but the ease with which this can be taught and played misleads as to the strategic and tactical complexity on offer. Be warned. An experienced and focused player will destroy opponents who lack either the same knowledge or concentration.

Pozitívum: Szép a játék! Hasonlít egy kicsit a Tzolkinra. Maga az alapjáték nem lenne rossz, csak kár, hogy nem az alappal játszottunk, pedig ezt a leírás mondja is, hogy addig, amíg valaki nem játszott legalább kétszer az alappal, az ne próbálkozzon a kiegessel.
Sajnos ez beigazolódott! Mire nagyjából átláttam a helyzetet, addigra a többiek elhúztak, ráadásul addigra elfogyott a pénzem, szóval ha ismertem volna rendesen a játékot, akkor se tudtam volna mit csinálni. Ekkor már futottam a "pénzem" után. Nagyon utolsó lettem.
Tanulság: Ha azt írja a leírás, hogy csak gyakorlat után játsszunk a kieggel, akkor azt meg kell fogadni!
Alapjáték:  7 pont
Kieggel:    6.5 p.
Összesítve a mélyvíz miatt és mert a többiek nem foglalkoztak ezzel: 5.8 :(

RATING: 8
This game starts slow but ramps up very quickly until suddenly it's over and your nemesis has beaten you while you sit on six blocks you were just about to use to turn into 40 points ...  Unlike most Euros, it's actually a race game, so it's more about efficiency of time than efficiency of resources.  You need to both identify the path of least resistance to the goals (which change each game for replayability) and then follow it while competing with your opponents to do the same.  It's a breath of fresh air in a crowded genre and you'll just love the feeling when you flip your screen to reveal your victory and bask in your opponents' astonished faces :)

RATING: 10
Very smooth mechanisms and quick turns. In this game, colored bricks are placed on a rotating wheel. The position and color of the bricks on the wheel dictates the cost of the bricks. Whenever a player buys bricks, the wheel rotates and refills on the next player's turn, which refreshes the selection, but also makes the unpurchased bricks less expensive. With a build action, you discard a number of bricks that match the cost of a building tile, but the color of bricks you use determines which city you are allowed to build in, and they al have different rewards when scoring. The game ends when a player has completed a certain number of the faceup goals, as opposed to a hard timer. Since scoring is an action you have to actually take and not something that just happens to you, the tension stays high and exciting.

I found my one play of the advanced game quite promising and wrote up my impressions [thread=873217]here[/thread].

UPDATE: this one was a real slow-burn hit for me. I played it a couple of times at Essen 2012 and then forgot about it for months. But when I played again, it really started getting its teeth into me and I ended up getting a copy. 

I love that it turns standard Euro tropes on their head - no 'money-first-VP-later' here - and that if you get the timing wrong you can be utterly humiliated by the scoring.

My feeling right now is it falls somewhere in complexity between Finca and Vikings, with the rules problems you see in Fresco due to pulling out segments of the real game in order to make basic and advanced versions. While the basic version may be useful for someone, most BGG people can jump straight to the advanced. Still, you need to have a love of middle-weight euros to appreciate this one. 

Like Finca, possibly plays best at two where turns come back to you quickly and less chaos between your last turn and your current turn. However, I like Finca at higher player counts and this plays fine with more people too; you just have to accept that more things can change on the overall state when the turn comes back to you.

I had very high expectations for this one, and I really enjoyed the resource wheel and general style of the game but I'm not sure I am a fan of the pace of scoring. It was a very tight race, but perhaps a bit too restrictive. Final scoring never seems to be very close, probably because it is way too easy to get blocked out of a strategy you've been working all game towards. Brutal.

First Impression after a two player game. I have mixed feeling about this game. I love the mechanic of getting resources and scoring. However, the scoring part makes me feel like I have to race with my opponents because once the city is scored, I cannot score. By racing to score first leaves the game feel weird toward to end. Each player can only score 6 times during the game. Once you score all 6 times, all you are left to do is to build buildings and place them in random cities to score the victory points on the building, and try to spend all the leftover money on objects. The game feels like a curve. It starts slow (collect resources), the peak (build building and race to score), the slow again (dispose leftover money and resources). I think the game will be tighter with more players. 30 buildings for two player is too many. The end really feels like a slow burn. Will definitely try again though.

I'll leave it at 9 with 5 plays. Rating subject to increase of course. Reason I lowered rating is because after five plays, I started to feel like the beginning of the game is quite scripted, due to the nature of the game. One just has to collect resources, which I understand, but I wish it were a little more exciting, that's all. Once things starts kicking, it of course becomes an incredibly tense and beautiful procedure.

Simple enough rules in this low direct confrontation game that plays with quick turns and finishes nicely in about an hour. Nothing very impressive theme wise, but there's lots of choices and the Vikings wheel mechanic is a fun way of distributing resources. These Eurogames need to come up with new ways of doing things and this delivers an under-utilised mechanic mixed with constricted scoring wrapped up in nice artwork.

Apart from Vikings the game reminds me of Firenze, with it's style of player interaction and taking opportunities while denying them from your opponents. While I prefer Firenze slightly over this because of the variability the action cards provide, this has its own charm re scoring and timing. One area I'm not too keen on is the hoarding of white and yellow blocks. Where Firenze deals with this elegantly with various card actions, Carrara doesn't really deal with it at all. So naturally after half a play gamers quickly realise that storing white and yellow blocks can deny your opponents and set you up for a profitable end game. It lets the game down a bit for me. Additionally it feels a bit like it's just an exercise in efficiency. Always buy using the cheapest blocks possible - each 3.3 coins are worth about a point. Firenze feels like there's more choice and uncertainty when I play.

I'd recommend including the expansion once you've got that first play under your belt. With the further options it provides I'd say it's needed for me to enjoy repeated plays.

This is a pretty good euro. The different goals lead to a decent amount of variability between games, and I like that there are incentives to push the game to a fast conclusion or ignore the endgame conditions and just keep stacking up points, which leads to multiple strategies within a single game. Still, it's just not my kind of game. I enjoy playing it, but I wouldn't seek it out either.

The Palaces of Carrara --

[q="eknauer"]"Reminiscent of Vikings with a market wheel, branching tiles from personal player boards, bonus tiles that enhance your score, and an overall puzzley feel to gameplay, yet one that feels distinct enough to secure a permanent place in my collection. As with Vikings, don’t bother with the base game."[/q]
I would add that the variable game-ending conditions make each play take on a new character.

There is so little direct player interaction that I expect others will characterize Carrara as multi-player solitaire.  However, players' actions do have a rather large impact on others, primarily by reducing the availability of limited resources (blocks, buildings, bonus tiles, and "objects").

Between Cities, Buildings, Blocks and Objects, there is a lot to consider, but play itself moves along at a pleasant pace, as the number of choices available on a player's turn is manageable.

This is a keeper.  Now I just have to get my hands on a copy, so keeping it is even possible.

I surprised I like this. It looks like a resource conversion euro with some rondel/tzolkin mechanism, but it's not, it's about proper reading of end game goals and conditions while predicting and reading what other people will do. It's about the groupthink. And it's a vividly coloured affair with some clever graphic design - colour coding helps you access the game state easier. 

There's one problem - in this game you MUST follow what others are doing, in particular what buildings they have. Yet, that is hard to do this as every player has individual player boards, while main board is filled with unnecessary stuff (new building tiles could be elsewhere). I think the decision to go with individual player boards was a mistake. 

EDIT: Some time passed and while I still enjoy the game, I'm not that crazy over it. I mostly played it as the alternative to less interesting euros the group preferred. As far as Kramer goes, I prefer Torres.

Played the basic version twice. The Palaces of Carrara presents players three simple options during their turn – do they buy, build or score? Buying involves an odd pricing wheel which makes remaining items steadily cheaper, while a particular aspect of the board can only be scored once per game. That's all there is to the game, really.

And yet the game challenges players in ways not immediately apparent at first blush. A lot of it has to do with balancing long-term against short-term objectives. Players have to pick a path which would maximise their scoring based on the end-game scoring criteria, but at the same time they have to watch out for what their opponents are building up towards, as they may be vying for the same city or symbols.

The Palaces of Carrara is like a caricature of a typical old-school Euro – there is no theme nor novel mechanism here that serves as a talking point after the game is over. But when such mind-teasing gameplay can be packed into an hour, it's admittedly easier to overlook those deficiencies.

Only a few plays but it seems like a solid game. The key "wheel" mechanic for purchasing resources is an interesting concept. I found that the first 4-5 rounds play out the same (everyone buying resources) and towards the end they're all rushing to score their areas. Game play tends to follow a similar pattern however there are multiple scoring conditions which allow for slightly different strategies. Good for occasional play, but not great.

Nice economic, middle-weight euro. Being born and raised on at the foothills of the Apuan Alps (where Carrara's WHITE marble is quarried from), I can guarantee the theme does not make one bit of sense (are we supposed to be buying marble in different colours? What is the - intriguing, granted - rondel mechanics supposed to represent exactly? And, anyway, could the authors point me toward one of the famous palaces of Carrara?). Having said that, I do enjoy playing a game with familiar location names on the board.

This is a totally serviceable classic euro design.  In and out, score in a couple different ways, play with a fun gimmick, and then done.

That said, nothing about it feels particularly fresh or exciting either.  It just kind of unremarkably does its thing.

It is short, which is nice, I guess. 

I love the Lazy Susan. It is hilarious to see these guys trying to go for a series of games based on spinning disc (Vikings, Artus). I'm going to be stoked to see a Chinese food game use this.

Update: after play #2 (on Yucata), basic game

Don't bother playing the basic game! I'm certain I will, since that's what is currently available on Yucata, but the advanced game is MUCH better -- the basic game seems that it should pretty much go like this: spend early turns buying bricks, then score your gold-earning things, then buy and score for VP.

------
1st play, 3er

This is (or at least can be) a very quick-playing game! You have to keep a close eye on what other players are doing, to avoid someone rushing the end while you're still gathering resources. You also must be aware of what they're collecting (Objects, bricks, building types), to either try to sneak in and score before they do (essentially wasting a lot of their previous work) or to just do something different yourself. Timing is key: go where others aren't, or beat them to the punch.

If you know what you're doing (I certainly did not!) I think the game would be pretty tense!

[b]--- Summary (advanced game) ---[/b]
A cool rotating wheel is seeded with bricks in a variety of colors, distributed amongst the various wedges of the circle. Players start the game with a (random? based on player order?) assortment of bricks (behind player screen), some money, a player board, and 6 scoring markers. The board is seeded with a 9 random building tiles (several different types, each with one of several icons). The Objectives board is seeded with some random cards. Several advanced buildings are placed nearby. 

On your turn, take ONE action:
- Buy Blocks: either don't rotate the wheel, or rotate one step and add random bricks to the lowest numbered wedge. Then, buy bricks from one wedge: prices vary according to color, with unnamed colors being free.
- Build Buildings: take building from board (which is then replenished), or from advanced building display. Spend the required number of bricks (any color) and place in legal city near your board: each city will only accept bricks of some colors. Take a token (Object) matching the icon on the building. 
- Score: use one of your markers to earn VP and/or money. Many of the scoring types may only be scored by one player -- first one to choose it! The awards are based on number of buildings of that type, or in that city, etc. 
Then, you may buy an Object token from the board.

If a player achieves at least 3 of the 4 objectives, may announce Game End and earn 5VP. End also triggered if last building is built. Finish the round (equal number of turns); most VP wins!

The Palaces of Carrara 

An Elegant and Brilliant Smooth playing Game that is So Simple to play yet has enough decisions and Stragey for a Medium Light game!  WOW!!!

I love this game PERIOD!!

I was worried that because on our turn the play is so simple (you literally choose to do one of two things) it would be too light and lack strategic depth after several plays.  But I am still learning and trying to figure out how to maximize scoring and timing after 5 plays. Still unsure if I fully grasp it all yet. So much fun!

It's a very simple game, very simple to teach, but hard to play well against someone else who knows the game.

It's fun, very little down time, smooth, gives you choices and gives you enough to think about especially with the "advanced" 8 pts buildings and bonuses you can choose from after building one.  Even more to think about and you add the 4th goal card and all the game end goal cards can be randomized too so you can play a slightly different game every time.

Still haven't perfected the timing and scoring of it all but am getting better at it after 4-5 plays with players who know how to play well.

Ranking based on playing the Advanced game with the 8pt buildings, Bonus upgrade tiles and random end game triggers and goals (additional 4th goal card played as well).

RATING: 7
Players buy different colours of marble from a market wheel thing where lots get cheaper as time goes on, then use them to place building in six Italian cities. Only white marble (the most expensive) is acceptable in Livorno, where each block used is worth 3 victory points; only builders in Lerici will deign to use all six colours, but blocks there are worth a mere 1 gold. To actually get these prices it is necessary to take an action to score either the city or the type of building (villa, palazzo etc.) -- but while each player can score a building type once each, a city may be scored at most once (across all players). If the latter is a race, efficiency in the former  must be weighed against end-game scoring conditions rewarding a large variety of buildings.

The advanced game adds some other wrinkles, such as variable end conditions, variable bonus points, and high-value buildings that increase a player's scoring -- e.g., turn Pisa from "3 gold per block" to "4 gold and 1 VP per block".

It's a very solid little game and the large number of different point cards in the advanced game look to add a lot of variety. Artwork is the typically bland Vohlwinkel sort. There's nothing spectacularly interesting to it but it works well and it is important to watch what other players are doing. Very good.

The goods distribution mechanic is really interesting with the goods wheel rotating every time someone makes a purchase.

RATING: 8.2
I really like a few aspects of this; the wheel to determine the cost of resources available, the push-your-luck of how big to build a city before scoring it, the variable end game conditions.

I also like how, because of the scoring, you're forced to be aware of what others are doing on their boards and how they're building their cities. I suspect it might be a bit more vicious with 4 than with 2 (unless there are any rule changes?).

I'd like to see what the advanced game does differently, as this rating is based on a play of the beginner game only.

Update: what the advanced game does is add in tons of variety, give you a little more control over the price of marble and generally offer a little more game for the money. Some of the scoring cards are a little screwy (the points for rural [green] buildings is a bit of a mess since it actively discourages building if there are only orange [urban] buildings in the display) but that is fairly minor.

Rating up from 7 to 7.7 and up again to 8.2.

A very solid and neat game. It is all about time. It feels like you race for everything all the time, so tension betwen players is coming up very quickly. The theme is going well with the wheel mechanic and the battle for scoring cities is intense. However I am not a fan of how the way of the ending is triggered, especially with 4 players. There is so much to check on other players' board to "feel in control of your strategy".

A satisfyingly short and tight game of resource management and timing. The fact that you have to sacrifice a turn to score is brilliant, and serves to emphasize the importance of timing all the more. Turns are quick, which leads to very little down-time. The pressure to get as much done as possible before the clock runs down is deceptively tense (your first play or two may seem befuddling on this note). On top of all this, the deck of endgame conditions/scoring opportunities ensures that each game will be a little different. I wish that player interaction was a bit higher, and not so strongly tied to seating position; however, all in all, this is an enjoyable game that I can't believe didn't see wider distribution in the States.

On rules: I applaud the efforts to include a beginner version of the rules, and I do think it's worth it to work up to the advanced rules. That said, it can lead to some confusion as you transition -- but that's a minor complaint.

Found this game to be just OK, although several members of my game group love it. In addition to just not feeling at all that exciting, The Palaces of Carrara also is the type of game where seating order REALLY matters. Play to the left of a very stubborn, defensive-minded opponent and you're screwed, while playing to the left of someone who is concentrating more on their own game leaves you a much clearer path to a good score. That problem is cured by having players of equal skill and experience, but I just didn't find this fun enough to give it that kind of time.

A nice game about finding the right timing between taking resources, constructing buildings or scoring. The latter with a nice twist since you have common scoring grounds  and your own, locally reserved, scoring spaces. Keep an eye open as to your coplayers plans since common ground spaces can be scored only only once, just like the spaces that are reserved for you. Interaction expresses as a recurrent theme in all three possible actions - taking resources, scoring, building - in a "reduce coplayers' options" sort of way.

RATING: 8.5
I like playing this game. It has a really great combo-building element. And once players know it well, it actually plays out as a really interactive Euro, even though it players building out their own player boards. There are interesting decisions and competition in the resource wheel. There is tense timing in who takes what buildings and who gets to certain city scoring first. It's puzzly, and has just enough depth to keep you coming back. It's also relatively easy to explain. The rules are straight forward. You'll grind, but should never come to a screeching AP halt. Good mix of thinky, but not too AP prone.

It does have one negative, though. Final scores are usually wildly disparate. The winner will run away in the last turn or two, while the loser(s) will stay with a really low score. I guess it's just all about being that one player who jumps way out; but I miss the tension in not knowing who's going to win right up until all the points are calculated.

If you're okay with losing badly whenever you lose, this is a good little game. I'll be keeping ahold of my German edition.

RATING: 6.75
I was excited to play this game, just because it's not going to be widely available in the US. My first impression was that it's a pretty game with a neat resource acquisition method. Unfortunately, that's about what the game is. The resource wheel is clever, where goods get cheaper over time. The problem with the game is that everything is just pretty straightforward. You buy bricks which lets you build buildings, better spots take rarer/pricier color bricks. Better spots pay out better, some for points, some for money. The expansion tiles (we didn't play the cards) added a little bit of interest where you can upgrade some of your locations. You get to score by city (if you're the first) and by building type, and (in the expansion) by the green/orange building color.

There's nothing wrong here, just nothing very deep.

RATING: 6
[thing=129948][/thing] has several options and the buying mechanism is pretty clever and works well both to allow for choices and to create indirect interaction, which is also present in the dispute for buildings and the scoring of cities: always indirect, but can seriously mess with the game of someone else if you score first a city in which a person has several buildings.

Overall [thing=129948][/thing] does its thing, but with a somewhat opaque final scoring (is hard to really keep track) and having a strong mechanical feel to it make it a little of a chore to play, putting a foot in the boredom realm. Therefore, I would play it again, however, won't seek out or ask for it.

RATING: N/A
Six-slot market offering a total of up to 11 items (bricks in six colors). Each color has an inherent price and as they work through the slots they obtain fixed, increasing discounts until they become free. When you buy, you optionally move everything a step downward before buying. (When you do this, items in the last slot wrap around, and new bricks are added to the most expensive slot so that all bricks total 11.) You can only buy from one slot per turn, so free goods may be undesirable because of the opportunity cost of not being able to get other bricks.

Rest of the game looks a bit uninteresting from rahdo's video.

A Kramer/Kiesling design that uses a rondel mechanism to distribute stone blocks for constructing buildings in various cities. Depending on the the type of blocks purchased for construction, players can erect the buildings in different cities which offer different values. For example, white blocks (marble?) can be used in any city, but Livorna, accepts only marble blocks for construction. Hence, Livorna bestows the highest number of victory points when scored. In a nutshell, the more expensive the blocks, the more cities will accept them for construction and thus, the higher the glory. 

The most unique mechanism in the game comes not from the rondel, but from initiation of scoring. Unlike other games where scoring is predetermined at a fixed period during game play, scoring here is determined individually at one's own pace. It reminds me of Rudiger Dorn's Arkadia. Players have six scoring opportunities in game either via scoring a collection of similar buildings or all the buildings in a particular city. The end game scoring includes scoring additional construction tokens and point values for each building. The advanced version of the game will open up more variable scoring opportunities since the scoring methodology can be altered.

The game is short and scoring should be carried out quickly and often, sometimes in less than optimal situations. The game is often over before players can carry out set collection strategies.

Overall a decent effort by Kramer and Kiesling but not sure if this is on top of the pile.

Excellent game that I don't get to play nearly enough.  Sorry, this is better than Vikings.  Which is why it's so infuriating that the game was so mishandled by ZMan, a publisher I went from loving (had their fan MB) to despising because of all their incompetence and arrogance. Shame that this game is caught in their field of influence.

The best Kramer I've played.  Plays like butter.  Has some variety in the scoring cards, and lots of options to focus on. Mid-weight, doesn't melt your brain but you won't win if you're not clever, and it doesn't overstay its welcome.  Lovely game.

I really like these medium weight kinds of games, lots of good think level required in a short play time. Again, nice artwork and gorgeous components. Game play is simple, a rotating wheel has variable prices for different colours of stone. Each time a player rotates the wheel, prices change and new stones come out. The colours of the stone you buy to build determine which cities you can build in. In one city, you can build with any colour, progressively each city gets harder to build in, finally in the last city you can only use one specific colour to build in. These cities can be scored when a player desires, earning points, money, or objects.

Each game has a set of randomly determined goals in setup such as you must build in 3 different cities, or you must have certain patterns of objects like 3 pairs, and so on. I really like this sort of thing from other games that have it, it's a nice source of replayability.

Excellent game with so much focus on careful timing and balancing deviation from your strategy to be opportunistic or not. A great system that I'm surprised we don't see more of is choosing when to score and variable end game/scoring conditions. I like how swiftly this flows.

I have no idea why this game isn't easier to acquire in America. It's a Spiel des Jahres Kennerspiel nominee, yet no one in the U.S. wanted to publish it? Madness.

As for the game itself, it is very simple. Players take turns buying from a market where the price is controlled by a wheel. The longer a good is unclaimed, the cheaper it gets. At the same time, players are racing to construct different buildings in the various cities, which have varying material requirements, the costs of which are dictated by the wheel. It's incredibly simple, but results in every turn being an agonizing decision. Do I spend big to lock up scarce resources, or pinch pennies and just take the left-overs, scoring VP's off of scraps? It can be hard to see which way is more effective, but regardless it's super quick and quite fun. 

I just wish it was easier to get ahold of.

2.6 - Really not a fun game for me. It's not interesting, even the 'advanced' version. Grabbing bricks for the first part of the game is fiddly and boring. There's nothing actually wrong with the game but there's nothing here to make me want to play it: very weak theme, no difficult or interesting decisions - it's bricks, buildings, score, bricks, buildings, score, over and over again. The variable end game goals do not add enough to make the game interesting (to me).

RATING: 7.25
I'm starting to like Kiesling and Kramer games. This one is fun. It balances nicely the decision between buying rubbish cheap or good stuff expensively and then deciding what to build with your purchased stuff. The fun bit then comes with the end game conditions. They change each game and are open. So sometimes the end can come quite unexpectedly, and better still you can rush it if you want to. I do love it when some one spends the game building a mega game-winning engine, only to not be able to use before the game ends.

How disappointing. these are 2 of my favourite authors but i really coudlnt understand this game, i can't even start describing why. i am willing to play it again sometimes and reevaluate it.
[EDIT 8/6/2014]: i was told we played the first game with wrong rules and this explains my puzzlement. I hope to play it again soon and increase the rating to a K&K usual level

[EDIT 17/8/2014]: the game was just published on Yucata.de, I read the rules again and started to play several games. Even before finish one of them i already know this is the game i was expecting from K&K. Tough decisions from beginning to end and if it were possible to play with different objective cards we would also have a lot of replayability. Simple enough rules and a lot of depth, just how a game should be. Rating from 5.5 to 8

Very similar to ZhanGuo. The game is very nice looking, and the ways to score are pretty interesting. The game ended much quicker then I would think. Not too heavy, and the game time makes it a have good fun/time-factor (almost in between a filler and a real game).

Very strategic game. You must think out of the box of the normal "I will build a victory point machine" and must focus on what you need to do to win and do it faster than your opponenents, else you will might end up with 10 points will they win with 90.

Have played 1.5 games and playing two more. Starting to grasp the idea and strategies to gather more points. The game is solid, but it looks like you are building up for the final score and the whole interest is in that end of the game and not much fun during the actual game play. Maybe it will go up after more plays. Or down.

The scoring mechanism in Palaces of Carrara really makes it stand out for me. Being in charge of when you score provides wonderfully agonizing choices. The advanced variant provides a wonderful amount of variability, encouraging players to focus on different objectives in different games. I can definitely see how many people think that this is the best Kramer and Kiesling game to date. Everything comes together so well, and it has their signatures stamped all over it. I’m really looking forward to more plays to play with different objectives. I’d happily play the basic game when introducing it to new gamers and surely have fun (there’s nothing bad with the basic game); however, Tyler and I will probably always play the advanced game when it’s just us or when we’re playing with more experienced gamers.

A truly great game design.  100% pure euro.  I love how the game has a racing element and how you can't spend too long building up your engine to score or gain gold because it could cost you the game against a player who is focusing on completing the objectives ASAP.

This is a really great, tense game.  Numerous ways to approach every aspect of it, yet plenty of competition.  There is plenty of replay value here, and plenty to explore.  Oh, and it's completely trivial to dive into the envelope for your first play if you're an experienced gamer.

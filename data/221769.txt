I'd opine that this is the most accessible Sierra Madre title to date. Lotsa player interaction, no knowledge of the underlying science is needed to play/ enjoy this game. 

As with other recent titles (i.e. Pax Renaissance), this game has a completely unique game board mechanic of shifting/ colliding 'cratons' (not croutons!).

If you've ever been hesitant about trying a Sierra Madre game (as they do have something of a reputation of being somewhat obtuse) I'd say this is a great place to start.

Despite not being a pure Eklund design it still tilts towards simulation more than a pure game. Now, that being said, it does have better game mechanisms and it is easier to grasp and play... even the rulebook can be understood with one or two readings! The theme is just too interesting to pass on this one.

Typical Eklund game. Fascinating theme, horrible rulebook. If you´re playing with more people it becomes a real brainburner, lots of ways for competition and optimization. Nice art, good components (some warping) and a solid connection to the theme. As a simulation I prefer American Megafauna, but this one offers more decisions.

Initial comments on 2 plays of the Mars solo game: 

I found that the theme comes through quite strongly in the mechanisms. The game did feel like the development of an ecosystem around scant pockets of water, growing from a few basic plants to the emergence and spread of new plants and animals in different shapes, first herbivores then carnivores, all precariously balanced upon terrestrial conditions largely beyond my control. Getting more plants out was a priority, since it means more space for animals and more oxygen in the air (so the animals can take more actions) - very thematic.

Gets me right in my evolutionary niche.

Sierra Madre games are a mixture of deep and long term strategic planning, and short-term chaos that requires tactical agility. This means that rote-learning an optimal strategy is impossible, and you're asked to devise complex plans on the fly. This... isn't easy.

Megafauna 2 is no exception. Where it differs from previous editions is that a large amount of the calamities are under player control - it's no longer the case that the planet feels as though it hates you and all that you love, this is sometimes literally the case, since the Medea player's decisions are being made explicitly to hurt you. It's also the case in this edition that if you manage to get into a scoring position, it's hard to lose those points, so you can convert the unstable, frothing chaos into something tangible fairly easily.

[b]The theme:[/b] As a molecular biologist, of course I am interested in everything related to evolution. And that is what [thing=221769][/thing] is all about. You start as a shapeless blob that is just trying to survive in the harsh world where mountains form, everything freezes over and continents shift constantly. Throughout the game, you gain various mutations that sometimes allow you to speciate into a daughter species able to fly, burrow, swim or ... armor up. Every little mechanic in the game is heavily connected to the theme and everything just works. Which is what I love about Eklund's games and this one is no exception!

[b]The components:[/b] I admit that some of his games are not that nice (looking at you, [thing=128780][/thing], with your cluttered cards and terrible money tokens) but this is not that case. For starters, the ani-meeples are absolutely gorgeous (and cute, of course! :) ). The artwork on the box is also gorgeous. The cardstock is great as well and there finally is a great balance between artwork, fluff and gameplay-related information on the cards. Everything is very clean and functional with very good iconography. One thing that really bugs me, though: why on Earth is there one fewer player aid than the number of players? :shake:  

[b]The fun:[/b] The fun factor is great as well. You can predate on the same-shaped species and blobs (and others, if you have the right tools). You can contest for important regions. Plus, with one player deciding where certain things go, it can get quite mean, indeed. Which is always fun!

[b]The gameplay:[/b] At its core, [thing=221769][/thing], is an area control game. Unlike most other Eklund's game I have played, there is basically no dice rolling (just occasionally for one type of events. During 10-15 rounds, you need to carefully adapt to the constantly changing environment. There is also a lot less luck involved in [thing=221769][/thing] than in other Eklund's games which is great - you only get one or two random event cards each round and then you might not have the wanted mutations on display. Otherwise it all depends on you!

Lots of mechansims thrown together, does not feel very smooth. There are interesting decisions to be made, but there are a lot of random events although , which change the situation on the board 180°. Interesting simulation and story, but to random for the time it takes to finish the game

Despite the usual Eklundian manual, the game is fairly straightforward and very FUN to play. I Love it!
It does have a big random factor, but players have plenty of options to counteract or even take advantage of that randomness.
The theme is extremely well integrated. Even if you ignore all the fluff on the cards, there is no avoiding of thinking ans speaking in terms of "species", "carnivores", mutations etc.

Once you have worked through the pretty cryptic worded rules it's a very unique and intense game. But with lots of luck involved in the full "Achterbahn"-game.

This game leaves a deep brain burn in my memories and this in a very good way. Imagine Dominant Species on moving Hex fields (Continents that move with plate tectonic). Combine that with Mutation Cards grounded in real science, add personalities and emotions for every creature you create, name meeples creeples, put every player against the other and let meteors rain down on Earth. More game in a box is not possible - believe me! And on your way learning the game you will experience the history of evolution and how kind the fans of this game on BGG can be answering your questions that will arise. Most importantly never give up learning: The manual reads like a nightmare, but Megafauna plays like a dream. Preliminary rating 8-9. Will adjust this after a few plays where the rules sit tight in my head and i have experienced the game with different player counts. Especially in comparison to Bios:Genesis.

Bios:Megafauna 2nd Edition

Description from the publisher:
Bios: Megafauna starts where the predecessor game Bios: Genesis left off, with the invasion of the land on the daybreak of the Phanerozoic eon. Starting as either a plant, mollusk, insect, or vertebral skeletal type, your flapping, paddling, and squawking carnivores and herbivores make a beachhead on one of the drifting continental plates in the Cambrian, Their struggle for terrestrial dominance may eventually include language-based consciousness. Although this achievement elevated a certain mammal species to notoriety, in your game things may occur differently.
This second edition of Bios: Megafauna is an evolutionary descendant of American Megafauna but as a part of the Bios series of games it is linked to the game Bios: Genesis. It plays well independently but if you have both games you can let the end state of a game of Bios: Genesis affect the starting state of a game of Bios: Megafauna. A successor game, called Bios: Origins (which would be a descendant of Origin), is planned to cover the events of the Quaternary period including the rise of ideas and technology.

This is a great follow-up game to the first edition of Bios: Megafauna. The differences between the two editions are significant and it is definitely worth owning both. I love the interplay between atmospheric gases, plate tectonics, climate, and biomes, which is more detailed and nuanced in this edition (using the Achterbahn rules). The challenge of the game is to keep your species competitive in a dynamic environment mainly through the acquisition of new traits and speciation. Much of the evolutionary biology is simplified, abstracted and, at times, perhaps even a bit misleading. However, given the complexity of the subject, this is understandable in a board game and easily forgiven. The overall result is a wonderfully engaging game that neatly captures an important chapter in the History of Life.

I'm not sure I'll ever get them played but I already have Genesis - I'd like to get Megafauna 2E and later Origins 2E. All those plus my High Frontier basically covers existence from the start of life in our solar system to man's journey to the stars. How can you not own a game arc like that?

The rule book unashamedly throws a ridiculous amount of information at you (everything *including* the kitchen sink) with supporting scientific data, but much of this info is lost in game context.

The best way to learn is to note the key rules (e.g., Green's number of Actions determination differs from other players) and just gain a cursory familiarity with all the other stuff. 

What a beast, truly mind-boggling (confusing and complex). Yet totally fascinating as one would expect, still I am finding myself preferring the 1st edition (which is one of my favorite games of all time).

Seems like a huge amount of mechanics but not much game. 

Human choice is limited to a choice of 8 communal cards per turn, use of a card in two different ways, modifying and streamlining statistics and releasing creatures on the board to be placed on locations and do battle.

In comparison there is a ridiculous amount of non-pc controlled  mechanics, random card turns, moving tokens on and of board to change the conditions, moving continents, natural disasters, climate, latitude of continents, random area annihilation etc all of which players have no control over and are decided by random card draw. For such a heavy game (and it is heavy) there is a lot of pointless random. I've seen players loose 60% of their progress in one turn. Twice over. or players being isolated or stuck with no possible progress for 4 or more turns of a 10 turn game. As a biologist that's thematic, as a gamer in a 3 hour game its wierd.

This is definitely a clever design. With the climate board and moving continents the situation evolves and creates great deal of unpredictability, that can still however be controlled by players and it is more or less possible to adjust to it.

I'm typically a big fan of Eklund games, but this seemed flat on the first go.  Along with most complicated games, it likely needs a dedicated group to get the most out of it and I'm skeptical that many such groups will form.  Perhaps not a fair assessment, but I did not see much game to play here.  With so much of the "fluff" for the game being hard science I doubt this will be the immersive experience for me.  I'm definitely willing to try it a few more times on account of the credit SMG have built up with their other games.

2018-02-22 [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b] Very tentative rating based on solitaire 2p with the baby, stripped down Tooth & Claw variant, but it seems like an interesting and fun game.

2018-02-23 [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] Still Tooth & Claw, but we played half of a 4p game (still several hours), and other than some outstanding timing / domino effect questions, I am digging it. I feel like the full "Achterbahn" game will sport significantly greater rules complexity, but will be more interesting and less… bloodsport. :)
2018-02-26 [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] With a 2p Achterbahn game — er, double game, because we mistakenly played 4 full eras — I can say that I'm really kind of digging this. Mars, here I come!

RATING: 8
Reminiscent somewhat of By Hook or by Crook and Witches Brew (two very good games), this game really packs a lot of "group fun" into a relatively simple 1-2-3 reveal mechanic combined with collection majorities scored at the end of each of three rounds.  Rather straightforwardly, the 1-2-3 reveal mechanic generates amusing moments of joy, shock and surprise as the players find out if their player predictions were accurate.  

Interestingly, when only one player chooses an action, that player experiences serious gaming joy.  Yes, I got it!  When three or more players select an action, they all experience considerable, though playful and bemused, irritation.  What, why did you two also select this action: now we can't do it?!  And when exactly two players select an action, the side barter/auction mechanic, which then comes into play, a mechanic seemingly distinctive to this game, is often a very interesting gaming exercise.  

So, from a game design perspective, this game manages to almost magically pack a lot of interesting emotions and decisions into a relatively small package.  A simply amusing game.

RATING: 6
This is a blind bidding game, but with a catch.  When ties occur, players must conduct a secondary auction.  The winner of the secondary action gets to take the action but with a cost paid to the loser.  This secondary auction is interesting and adds quite a bit of decision making but at the expense of involving the other players.  Thus the game feels very divided between the players as each turn breaks down the interactions between players to constantly (usually) shifting sub groups.  Those not involved in the secondary action are left out of the action, but usually are better off in the overall game.  So the winner might feel isolated from the other players.  The net result of the game play is a fractured feeling.  It is an interesting game, but not stellar.  If player interaction, or more specifically, player involvement is important, be aware of the subgroup events that are likely to emerge during a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Tentative rating after one play.  I'd say that this is an early precurser to Race for the Galaxy, but unlike RftG, after one play you feel like you understand it.  Trying to outthink everyone else on picking money, gems or contracts can cause brain melt.

A bluffing and negotiation card game that plays in a reasonable amount of time. It reminded me a little of the Steve Jackson game Revolution.

You are trying to gain money (points) by either obtaining majorities in gems or via action cards (certificates or other bonuses). Players blind bid for what they want to try to do and if they are alone, they do the action. If two players pick the same one, they barter for who gets to do it by bidding gems. If 3 or more pick the same action, no one gets the action. The fun comes in trying to guess what your opponents will do, gauging what your best action will be and weighing whether you should take a less optimal action versus your best so you don't lose a turn.

My low rating is just based on personal preference. I can see that it's a good game, but I'm not crazy about having to base my decisions on what I think other people are going to do. I'm terrible at that, and that's half of this game. I also wasn't crazy about the negotiation part--another mechanic of which I'm not so fond. As I got more used to it, it got a bit better, and I guess I'd play it again if that's what everyone else wanted to play, but I'd never choose it.

Even if you are not a fan of simultaneous actions, the trading opportunities in this game are well worth the effort.  Sometimes, it is better to choose an action you know someone else will choose just because you have the upper hand in trading and can get more from them than the action in question.

The bidding negotiations were interestingly twisted. You can palm off some rubbish on your opponent in exchange for them letting you take your turn.

RATING: 6
More or less advanced Adel Verpflichtet, my initial reaction is pretty lukewarm. A bluff game with negotiation added on to make it a little more interesting. I do like the idea behind the title, as it can be very tricky to decide where to play: a lucrative option can look so good that everyone avoids it, or that everyone will go into it at the same time; so the double think is fun. The negotiation seems like a good concept, and adds a touch of meat to the title, but it didn't seem to have enough tension or excitement in the game that we played. It might have just been because of our inexperience, but the offers generally were just a matter of getting rid of gems that you had no hope of getting involved in to begin with...I think there is more room for creativity in that regard, as it seems like it should be possible at least in the first 2/3 of the game to use negotiation to effectively get into otherwise hard to go after colours and make a push in the late game. I'm definitely willing to play it again, but nothing that I'll ever clamor for either.

The need for second guessing with simultaneous actions reminds me of Hoity Toity.

Giving each player differing benefits of each action makes it seem easier to predict what others will do.

The need for majorities gives the game a real tension whilst the retaining of all your gems if you didn't score in that round helps give it some negative feedback, allowing for comebacks.

It started out strong. I really liked the fluidity of the currencies and the variable "values" of the gems.

Good game of simultaneous card play and bidding; players are involved most of the time.  Whether strategy can really be applied, or is just pure guesswork amounting to pure luck, I dont know; sometimes you can outguess a few people, but it seems fairly random/chaotic.  Also, the game is too long and, because of its simplicity, a bit too repetitive; maybe playing to two phases would be better than to three.

Unusually random and light fare from Alea, plays more like a family game than a real challenge for geeks. The basic mechanics are perhaps more fully realized in other games, and the draw of event cards introduces a high luck element that can either lead to incredible gains or totally useless cards. The trading phase is the most interesting aspect of the game (when two players have played the same action, they have to negotiate who is actually going to do it). Not a bad game at all, but not a GREAT one, as one has come to expect of Alea.

The perfect simultaneous action-choice game, with beautiful components. Determining which action to take for yourself is difficult enough, let alone guessing what the other players will choose. Event Cards allow a dramatic swing in situations, but also attract a lot of attention (thus risking enough people choosing it, causing it to be discarded). I think the Contracts race can hit a roadblock when two players each have one Contract, making it unwise for a third to try to enter the race (but it's unlikely for all that many Contracts to appear in any given round). With five players, the "chicken-out" choice changes the demeanor of the game, but I enjoy it either way.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Significantly different to Basari, with 4 options and more players, it's hard to out-think everyone. A good variation, but I think I prefer Basari. *** Played again after a long gap. Now I feel it is not too different to Basari. The extra option applies with 5 players only. With three, the balance and feel of the game is similar to Basari, the randomness in the card draw replaces the randomness of the dice rolls. The big difference (which now seems so glaring to me) is the action cards, which throw a significant cat amongst the pigeons. The certificates are an OK replacement for the round-the-track bonus in Basari, but the extra score cards add a lot to your score. 

I'm sufficiently happy to play either version now and I'm inclined to give this more of a run out now.

Played 10+ times. It's abstract, and you pay quite a bit of money for a deck of cards and a handful of plastic gems, but wow! this game has a lot of punch. Tons or evaluation and re-evaluation makes for a fun negotiation game. Some player luck, but game still has nice tension in the bartering, and scores always seem fairly close. | Abstraction bothers me a bit more than it used to, but still a fine game.

RATING: 7
This game seems to be a little different from its predecessor from what I have heard; I thoroughly enjoyed it but I cannot make a comparison with Basari as I have not had the (dis?)pleasure.

I like the way there are so many options (subtle or not) which can work in your favour (or not, as the case may be).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Basari, but better.  This is one of the very best "outguessing" games out there, probably the best since Adel Verpflichtet.  It's more than just outguessing, though - the offering of gems for duplicated actions is the most fascinating part of the game.  It reminds me of the Löwenherz tiebreaking system, but is much more intriguing here because the gems don't have strict cash values and also because you can often paint a player into a corner with a clever offer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Five plays. Seemed a little messy at first, but once we got the hang of it this turned out to be an excellent if slightly weird middleweight game. The agonizing fun of predicting who will choose what action is followed by the tense bartering process. Better, I think, than the somewhat similar Adel Verpflichtet.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
German edition; Better than Adel Verpflichtet (Hoity Toity) which it has a passing resemblence to. The tension in attempting to out second guess your opponents is considerable.

RATING: 9
Pro: Crowded doublethink, rules about what counts as "raising" a bid that you can twist to your advantage, perfect length.

Con: Gems and cash have nearly the same average value so some rounds feel like a false choice.

See my comments on Basari.  It's basically the same game.  The differences between them aren't even worth mentioning.  ESR is Basari + about a tenth of a ratings point.

RATING: 8
I really enjoy this game quite a bit, but I have fonder memories of it's predecessor, Basari. Really interesting choices and the chance to out-guess your opponents keep this game lively. *UPDATE* I need to play Basari again so I can remember why I liked it better than this one. I think ES&R works very well, although it tends to encourage specialization more than I would like.

RATING: 8
Very good game, mix of majority, auction and (mainly) outguessing your opponent's actions 
-a little bit like Adel Verpflichtet, except that AV doesn't work well with fewer than 4, and this one is just great with 3. Don't play it with 2, though: boring! (it's simply not the same game)

Played it again after many many years and I can't say that I liked it much. More or less a pure bluffing game and well, I don't like bluffing games, as you don't have enough influence.

Not bad but it didn't really grab me. I liked the negotiation bit but the game really rewards good guessing over negotiation. For a guessing game I'd take Hoity Toity instead. I'd play it again if it were suggested. I wonder if the supposedly cleaner design of Basari might appeal to me more. (rating after 1 play)

RATING: 7.5
This is a bidding game I really enjoyed. I've not had much success at bidding games and I've found more that I really like lately, and this one that fills the bill. I've never played the previous incarnation, but I love the way this one is done. I'm sure it helps that it was done by Alea. Great fun.

This game has become a hit with the people I play with, none of us playing Basari in the past.  I, of course, will always loose the games that I purchase, but this game is alot of fun!

They actually stopped playing this with me until just recently when I got stomped into the ground.  Oh well.

At heart a simple bidding game with a significant element of chance. But there are no open auctions - just bartering between two players, which can be fairly tactical. The scoring is also rather elegant, and the components are attractive. However, the final results seem to depend too much on the luck of the action choosing phase.

Great with 3 or 4 but no point in 5 players.  The 4 possible choices when playing with 5 all too quickly drops to 2 when the gem pool becomes exhausted.  And we're the first to notice this problem?

Having now finally played this a 2nd time after at least 2 years since I 1st played I can give this a fair rating. The blind choice element reminds me somewhat of Hoity Toity.

Extra options make it more interesting than Basari, and I don't miss the board movement.  Too bad there is no English version, but with the colorful English rules and card translations available on BGG, it is very manageable.  The card symbols make sense with a bit of play.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun game that combines guessing what your opponents are playing for with negotiation. Do I want one of the available actions or do I want to try and negotiate for some gems from a specific opponent? There is rarely a round that goes by without groans or a shout of joy. And the game doesn't seem to overstay its welcome.

RATING: 7
2 core mechanics in this baby. First you have the blind-action-selection, of which I'm not a big fan. Personally I am susceptible to pointless psychoanalysis, and can get frustrated by never seeming to be the lone chooser of an action. It's probably not as bad as I think. Second phase is the bidding for the action when 2 players both select it. I love the head-to-head bidding in this phase. Assuming you can get your fair shake in the action selections, the game is won and lost through bidding. The plastic gems are nice components and add to the overall gameplay experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Can't decide whether I prefer this or Basari. Both are great. Basari is a little tidier (having the board to organise things), but I like the action cards/certificates in this one, plus the fact that you don't know who's won until you add up your cash at the end.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A "light" game of trade and second-guessing opponents. Don't let the german language deter you. The blind bid becomes repetitive if you try to replay back-to-back. Also some beginners don't see the opportunities that you see for them making them completely unpredictable. Best not to mix women/men unless you like chaos. The luck factor and repetitiveness keep this from going higher. Still, a very good choice for gamers or non-gamers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Never having played Basari before, I have no frame of reference, but I was pleasantly surprised at how fun this game was.  I can see how those who dislike simultaneous action selection would despise this game, but I found it to be very refreshing - it plays quickly and stays interesting all the way till the end.  I like how there seem to be multiple paths to victory - the gems are a little elusive.  They seem to be the foundation of the game, but if a player is allowed to continually get the money option, they can easily pass everyone else if the others are all fighting over the gem majorities.  The bartering can drag a little, but it is an interesting part of the game.  I'd like to try this was different numbers of players to see if it holds up as well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A more complicated version of Basari. It did have some nice points, like a clever fifth player card, and much nicer gems, but I think that the special cards made the scoring much too random and unpredictable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Excellent game. The high repetition of the main mechanic makes it shine over other games that utilise it. The simultaneous selection is resolved well (though bidding is a little contrived) and makes for a game with excellent choices squeezed into a low game length. The perfect 3 player medium filler.

ESR is essentially "advanced" Basari and it accomadates up to five and scales according to # of plyrs.  I like the tense choices that ESR offers and enjoy the strategy more, but Basari is quicker to play and more streamlined and I much prefer having a board.

This is a nicer looking version of Basari, in a card game format. Love the gem set collection. Interesting negotiations if you tie with another player during action selection. There are some mean cards that come out in the event card stack, which is why I've downgraded this rating from a 7 to a 6. Definitely some game table discord surrounding some of these meaner event cards.

I like this even better than Basari, but not quite as much as Adel Verpflichtet.  Better than Basari, because it plays up to 5 and I prefer the variety of the cards in ESR to the comparitively static-seeming board in Basari.  Adel Verpflichtet, however, edges out ESR on being more streamlined.  An English version of this would be nice, but is not necessary.

Fun game of bluffing and auctioning. Unusual theme with nice components.

RATING: 6.5
This game has extremely simple turns: players each draw a card (which specifies how many gems and how much money can be won from that card), and then choose whether they want the gems on their card, the money on their card, or to go for neither and get a rule-breaking card.

The complexity comes in thusly: if three or more people choose the same item (e.g., three people want the gems on their cards), then nobody gets that item.  If two people choose the same item they have to barter for it (one person has to give the other gems), causing much stress (as the bidding is rigidly specified).  But if you're the only person to choose your item, you get it for free.

Scoring occurs thrice in the game: only the players with the most number of each of the four types of jewels get money (which are victory points).  

This means that each of the 21 rounds is filled with the stressful necessity to decide what role to pick, which of course requires guessing what everyone else will pick.  I found myself rather terrible at guessing what others would pick, and thus did rather awfully.

While I appreciate the clever mechanics, I just don't enjoy the game. Double-guessing is probably my least favourite mechanic, especially when combined with a hefty punishments. The one time I play, I lost about third of my turns. Never again with five, and it will take some heavy convincing to get me try the game with three.

Avoid.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
I just don't get it why people are raving about this game. Perhaps I just hate the mechanism where you have to know what other players might be playing so you can react to that but they might already coutneract that and... it feels like pure luck in the end.

Sure there is a negotiation aspect to it but it's quite clear from the beginning what each player can put in so also this part falls flat.

I have it in shrinkwrap and it will remain as such for a long time.

Game where you pick one of three roles per turn. If only 1 player chooses that role, they take it for free; if 2 pick it, they bid for the action; if 3 pick it, all 3 lose their turn.

The goal is to have the most of each type of gem and/or generate money to have the most at the end of the game.

No direct conflict, but you do have to bid against each other. Would want to try it out first.

Updated Basari for 5 players where the dice rolling has been removed. Cards are dealt to each individual player representing the jewels or money they can earn. The new actions are bid for contracts, or take gems from the supply. Despite being a blind simultaneous action game, it's fun. Sure, there is luck with who chooses what and doublethink, but had fun during my plays with it. In our games we haven't really explored all the contract cards yet, some of them can be destablizing.

Basari without dice but with special cards. Need to know the distribution of cards to enjoy the game. Played with 3 only so far... want to try 4 or 5.

RATING: 6
Collect 4 kind of jewels, majority in each one brings money when majorities are scored. Scoring comes with loss of half the jewels that were in majority. There are three scoring occasions in the game. The mechanism of the game is simultaneous action selection and only one player is allowed to execute the particular action. If two players choose the same action they bid with jewels for it, the low bidder gets the bid amount, the high bidder takes the action. The action can be acquisition of jewel, money or special cards that help immediately or at scoring. This is a fast, clever and simple game. Non-gamers usually like it, hence it is a good introductory game. It is strictly a 4 player game.

Excellent update to Basari.  Reduces the tension level somewhat, and in my opinion makes it a little easier to stage a comeback when you&#039;re hammered in the first round.  A touch more chaos than Basari, but overall a better game.  The bonus of being able to play with 5 (which I have - it&#039;s a blast) is nice too.  Highly recommended.

Only played (sigh) solitare, but I feel strongly that I'd like to play this, and if can get a group together in the right mood will suggest it. Excellent combo of bluffing, negotiating, with some pretty bits. Oddly, the German language adds to it's appeal even though I can't read it. UPDATE: Some helpful tools available here to translate the cards, print and laminate and put out with game for reference. 8/06: played this once at the end of 2005 with 4-players, and enjoyed it. I was hosed the whole game because of selling off one of the colors too cheaply if I remember right. Not quite appealing enough to get me to fight to get it to the top of the pile, unless perhaps my friends start really getting into auction games. I might encourage them to play Merchants of Amsterdam, Power Grid, or Traders of Genoa instead - granted they are not card games. Translating the cards is also a bit of a pain, I guess Basari fixes this?

Who can play?  Family game for 3-5 players.

This one really caught on quickly.  The rules translation was very easy to get by, and the game is quick and fun.  In each turn, the crux of the game is the choice to go for money, gems, or a special card.  You must guess what your opponents will pick.  If nobody picks your choice, you get it for free, but if someone else does pick yours, you get into a bidding war with them.  There is a lot of second guessing, and that's what really makes the game fun.

I enjoy the stone, scissors, paper element of choosing a role, and I also enjoy negotiation elements in a game, and this one fits both bills nicely.  Have played with between 3 and 5.  Four works best, as though there is far less trading with 3, and 5 is a tad unruly, with the 4th action card making things a bit less interesting.

Edel, Stein & Reich has a clever action selection system where each player has the same three choices to pick from simultaneously. If you're the only one picking an action, you get to do it, but if two of you choose the same one a bidding war starts. Special cards and a majority scoring system are used to give the players different incentives, which allows you to try to predict what the others are going to do. The system for resolving the bids is neat too, with players alternating escalating bids until someone accepts.

A pleasant surprise.
Liked both of the phases of a turn. The phases work well together.

A difficult decision on the simultaneous action selection as you try out guess your opponent
Like how the event cards make some actions more valuable to the owner, sets the stage for the next phase.

A bidding/extortion phase where people competing for the action bid for the right.

RATING: 8
Basari is much better than this by virtue of its components. I love Basari because it is an incredibly fast-paced game; it’s an intuitive game rather than a strategy game. All the cards that have to be dealt and discarded in ES&R slow down this game. Strangely enough, the event cards add a bit too much strategy and bog down the game as well.

Note: The “official” two-player variant does not work very well! To summarize, this variant involves you trying to guess your opponent’s intended action. If you guess right on your first try, your opponent loses his or her turn. If you guess right on the second time, you duel with gems. If you’ve guessed wrong both times, your opponent is free to take his or her action.

With this variant, you have so many chances to prevent your opponent from performing his or her action. So I figured that it’s more important to ensure my opponent doesn’t perform a specific action. So that’s the first action I’d pick when it’s my turn to guess, which means that the double-guessing element is drastically reduced in this variant. Next time I try this two-player, I’d allow the guesser, if he or she guesses right first, to perform his or her opponent’s action. 

UPDATE: Upgraded to an 8. Fast moving and tense at the same time. Next time I play with three players, I'll reduce the number of cards played per round to about six -- just like the five player game.

This game reminds me of Fluxx with strategy.  Okay, so the game itself doesn't play like Fluxx.  And it's got a fixed number of turns so it is impossible for the game to go on and on like Fluxx can, but it is like Fluxx in that there is a ton of player based chaos. And if I were to describe Edel, Stein & Reich with one word, it would be "chaotic."

So here's how the game works. In a four player game everyone has a hand of three action selection cards.  Then each player is dealt a card that describes different rewards each player will get if they select a particular action.  If a player picks an action that no one else has picked, they get to do that action for free.  Any two players who pick the same action will have to bid for the ability to take the action.  The player who wins the bid gets the action and the other player gets the winning player's bid.  But if three players pick the same action, no one gets to do that action.  When this happens, the one person who got an action gets a huge boost while the other players fall behind.

Here's my major gripe with this game.  A serious player will get grumpy when the other players don't play the way that they are "supposed" to.  The problem is that each player can reasonably predict what each player's "best move" is.  If a player's best move is the same as your move, it no longer becomes the best move for you to make.  While all this thinking and meta-gaming is fun, it's also frustrating for people who want their games to have strategy that makes sense.  For people like me who just want to enjoy a game, it's frustrating because I hate gaming with grumpy people.

A decent remake of Basari. The big plus is that it handles 5 players, though the number of gems seems a little low as they often run out creating artificial situations. I am undecided about the event cards: some are quite powerful and seem to add chaos, but of course players can bid and then discard them so it may come out in the wash - only more play will tell. Definitely less good is the lack of a score track: watching opponents' scores was important in Basari and set up the trading order in a better way than the lower number of red jewels mechanism. Overall a fun game of mind reading and shrewd bargaining: recommended, especially if you don't already have Basari.

This doesn't look like much of a game from afar but it is a tense bartering, out guess your opponent type game that is just fun.  The heart of the game is trying to determine what your opponents are choosing and not choosing that option unless you want to be in conflict with them.  the other big part of the game is the bartering when two battle for an action.  The barter is so interesting and unique such that you put up offers and either accept or not but it never puts anyone in a sour grapes type situation. I have never played a bartering game like this and it truly is a great experience .

This game, though still a bit agressive in the mechanics, is still worth it to own and play.  By allowing everyone a choice in one of the four possible plays each turn, with the knowledge that you may not get your choice if others make the same kind (trying to outguess your opponents), it prevents any direct "hostility", since you either get what you asked for alone, or nobody gets it because either nobody chose it or everyone did.  Well thought out!

Nice light bluffing game, with high quality bits. The cards are rather pretty, so I'm glad I went with this rather than Basari. The action selection mechanism works best with four players, as the 'everyone succeeds' scenario from the 3P and 5P games cannot occur, making bartering much more likely. The 5P game is great, though, and it's definitely not tacked on.

If you use the card aids on BGG, it's pretty much language independent, despite the German text. Played this with a German fellow who informs me that the title means Noble, Stone, & Rich, and that the Noble, Stone bit is a pun on the German word for gemstone.

My experience with this game has been that most people hate it. Your group needs to *love* simultaneous action selection or blind bidding type games for E,S, & R to succeed.

This is not a rock-paper-scissors type simultaneous selection game, as a) each  choice has an ordinal precedence, b) each choice has a differing value for each player, and c) clashes are resolved via negotiation.

Fiji has a similar vibe.

3-5 player simultaneous action-selection with bartering. The decision mechanism is really cool and very applicable to real life, and worth a play just to check it out.

The decision mechanism means you spend your time trying to figure out what you want, what other people want, and if you should be butting heads with people or ducking. Very refreshing game which has great gateway potential.

Best with 3 players, as it seems very well-balanced. 4 has balance issues (3 people pick 1 action, 1 person picks something else), and the possibility of 2 barter phases a turn can really bog the game down. 5-player is interesting because of the additional Free Choice action (I call it the action for PUSSIES), but has similar problems of player chaos.

Take Basari, a light hearted fun negotiation SdJ winner, toss in some chaotic event cards, remove the board, add a card to accomodate a 5th player and you get this mess.

Some of the event cards seem overpowered and it boils down to the players taking effort to rein the leaders in. Ultimately, the chaos feels almost Faidutti-like.

I like Basari for its simplicity and this one seems to have destroyed the soul that was in its predecessor.

Nice game, lots of interaction. I like it best with 3 or 5. With 4 players, I find if three people choose the same action one player gets a big benefit, and the other three don&#039;t even have the chance to barter. With 5 this happens too but there is a fourth action that decreases the chances and allows you to optionally always take an action.

It's Basari with a minor twist and no board.  Hard to say which version is better.  If you own one, you don't need to own both.  Which ever one you end up with should be fine.

The action cards are entertaining.

I am not a big fan of the 5 player game, the gems get too spread out and clogged up.  The other action card adds to more chances that more people will come up uncontested, but doesn't seem to lessen people's three way matches (especially when the gems are gone and those choices become worthless).

Although simultaneous action selection is not normally something I like, ESR does the mechanic so well, I can't help but enjoy the double, nay, triple, think involved.  Nominally a game of collecting sets, the majority of the game is a process of trying to outthink your opponents.  There are only 3 different actions you can do each round, and the only 'penalty-free' way to take an action is to choose one that no one else has chosen...but all 3 actions are a route to victory.  There's a teeny bit of lengthy thought at the very end of each round when there are only 1 or 2 more phases to go because you can more accurately plan on how people may respond to the bidding that happens if two players choose the same action.

The fact that you cannot simply follow a single course of action and win is great--even if you play strongly for card money, you'll soon lack the jewels necessary to bid effectively against a player who may happen to choose the same action.  Similarly if you choose only jewels, you'll be subject to some harsh attacks through the event cards.  It's balanced in somewhat of a rock-paper-scissors fashions in that each can put a crimp on the other.

Doesn't overstay its welcome, but there is a healthy bit of player-induced chaos involved, as well as a bit of random added by the event card draw.  This is worth more than what its currently selling for in the marketplace, so you might want to pick up a copy before it gets rediscovered.

[Alea 2003 edition] {Trader; negotiation, set collection, utility cards; optimal 4p} ESR is a sequel of Basari, which is targeted for gamers. It's not as accessible as Basari and only available in German. Players have more controls in ESR with event card replacement for dice. Basari and ESR are different enough. Given their price, it's no harm to own both games if you like bartering. I would pick Basari in casual game nights because the dice provides additional excitement; ESR is not as dynamic and funny as Basari because it's more calculative and static.

I don't treat it an absolute advantage to be a 5p game because the 4th action ('Free Choice') is artificial and senseless.

Boy, how did we all manage to forget how good a game this was? All the intensity of in depth board game but then allows you to watch in amusement as two other unfortunates (whose only mistake was to bid for the same prize) are being forced to bid away their hard-gotten gains. It's as entertaining a spectacle as you are ever likely to see in gaming circles. If you haven't played this recently, do try it out; I doubt you will be disappointed.

I'm surprised this game is not even higher in BGG score.  Of my 250+ games in my collection, this one by far got the most plays (so glad I used card sleeves from the beginning).  
I've played with many groups, and I'm yet to find a single person who is not immediately hooked.
Although for some reason, we ALWAYS play 2 epochs instead of the 3 in the rules.  We feel it gives the perfect length of play (3 epochs make this game just a bit too long IMHO).

I'd still give this game's progenitor, Basari, the slight edge, in large part because of its nice game board and pieces (at least the FX Schmid edition). However, Edel has some great twists on the original concept (including the bonus cards), is more compact in this card-based format and allows five players (rather than Basari's four). Edel is a terrific offering from Alea and well worth trying!

RATING: 8.5
Great game for 3-5 players. Collect gems for bidding on money, event cards and even more gems. Person with the most of gems of a color gets rewarded with even more money. Player with the most money at the end of the game wins. Very fun game as people try to constantly guess what people will go for so they can get things for cheap.

Edel, Stein & Reich is truly simple and charming.  The components are gorgeous and the bluffing is light and entertaining.  Perfectly produced English-pasteups are available on the Geek and help a great deal.

Oh, those sparkly, pretty jewels! I really enjoy this game: the simplicity of the play, the brain burning of the negotiations, the different routes to victory. Once you realize the potency of a well-rounded gem collection, you can really hammer the other players in negotiations. But make one too many bad choices because you didn't quite work out the "He knows that I know that he knows . . ." chain and you can blow your shot at victory.

Very tight game with close decisons all the way. The luck factor from Basari is eliminated.

Good game, all the actions seem well-balanced.  The only thing that's difficult to get your head around is relative value of gems when bartering over an action, but other than that it's pretty good.

RATING: 8
Quick and fun bidding and second-guessing game that's at its best with four.  The rules are straightforward, which make it easy to get to the table.  The bidding has subtlety and richness, and the Ereignis cards make sure no lead is safe, which keeps people on their toes.  Quality components finish the package nicely.

A nice Witch's Brew feel. Fewer actions cards available, and only one chosen, makes it even more painful when you're matched, but the bartering system offers a cool twist to just being knocked out of the round.

Alea Small Box #4.  The cards add a little to Basari by the same author, but I'd just as soon play Basari.  Would certainly play this instead if others prefer, but the cards add an unnecessary complexity to an already well designed game.

This game amazes me. The rules are simple yet the tension is always there. Played twice and love it both times. Highly recommended. However, blind actions and unique bartering system have turned female players away from this game

Cool game.  I almost got Basari on a friend's recommendation, but I decided to hold off.  We normally have 5 players.  When I found out about this version, I decided that it was "in the cards" so I picked it up.  That was over a year ago, and I am only now getting around to the game!

The game has a nice give and take to it.  It's easy to get caught up in the gems, but the money is the only thing that matters in the end.  The winner was the one who remembered that.  Some times I had a hard time choosing what to do, but a few times I felt I knew exactly what I was doing and it felt good.

P.S.  Maybe it was just the way we played, but given the specific rules for bartering, it felt more like a bidding game.

A lot of fun. A game of outguessing your opponents combined with some delicious bartering. 3 and 4 player are equally good (4 player is quite a bit more random).  Haven't tried 5 player yet.

Not sure if I like this or Basari better yet.  I'll probably have to play both a few times to really say for sure.  Some elements of this are more interesting and better, but there also seems like there may be a few event cards that are just too swingy (and provide maybe too much of a catchup mechanic).  Some swing (or weaker/stronger cards) is certainly fine and even good considering the game system, but a few seem to go overboard.

E,S&R combines bluffing/double-guessing and negotiation, and while it isn't my favorite game of either type, the two dynamics are meshed together well to create an entertaining 60-75 minute experience .

RATING: 6
First things first: If you're not a fan of simultaneous-selection games, and trying to out-think your opponents, a la Citadels or Basari, then this isn't your game.  If you do like that sort of thing, though, then this is a really good implementation of such a game.  Since it's based directly on Basari, you'll see similarities if you're familiar with both games, but ES&R adds a fifth player, and removes the die-rolling as an action.  Instead, players work for gems, money, and action cards, some of which can be a little chaotic, but are much less so than the roll of a die.  Additionally, the player who wins the action card can either take the face-up card or draw the top card from the deck, meaning that sometimes players will play offensively, so that another player doesn't wind up with a card that would give him a huge benefit.  It's a subtle form of interaction, but one that I really enjoy.

Gioco di carte dal tema economico, si cerca di collezionare gemme, ma in realtà è tutto basato su un meccanismo di bluff, si giocano carte sperando di essere stati gli unici ad aver scelto quel tipo di azione per usufruire dei benefici.

one play. pretty good game of trying to second guess your opponents. Have played 3 & 5 player games now and while there didn't seem to be enough clashing for actions with 3 player, it was an enjoyable game, 5 player seemed slightly chaotic. I think the sweet spot for this game would be 4 player.
UPDATE: 02 2010. Haven't played this for years. It's a much lighter game than I recall, but what fun... Def a keeper

Played several times (with 4 and 5 players). A nice game with interesting ideas, which works quite well. However, the majority system on gems is a bit brutal and can lead to some kingmaking, especially in the last round. Also, the cards are very unequal in interest, and a lucky draw can really make an undeserved difference. Still, the game is rather enjoyable.

This is one of the few games I can think of that is perfect with a certain number of players (3) and totally fails otherwise.  Beautiful art, components, etc.  Probably the best use of the rock, paper, scissors bidding mechanic I've ever seen.  Has exactly the right amount of depth for my tastes.  If you've only played this game with 4 players, you're missing out.

RATING: 6
First game with 4 players left me feeling "meh." I can sense interesting mechanics, but the four player dynamic seemed very, very awkward -- often my best move was to try to outguess my opponent rather than plan for myself, and guessing wrong, rather than planning poorly, can lose you the game. Also, when one player gets an action while the other three players have their actions canceled, the unchecked advantage is very significant. The incredibly high screw factor of simply guessing wrong reminded me too much of Pirates Cove, which also unfairly punishes players for good decisions that go poorly.

I prefer Basari. Even though this game adds another player, I miss rolling the dice and having a board. Plus, this game adds annoying action cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Part negotiation and part behavioral prediction.  The difficult aspect of the game is in the choosing of an action that will both benefit you and allow you to get the most out of it.  Could also play defensively by denying your opponent something he covet the most by selecting the same card.  Normally not the type of game I would enjoy, it is also too long for what it is.

Rating after one play. I think this one is pretty genious. It's so simple, you just select one of the four actions and do it if nobody else selected it. This game is all about reading other players' intentions. I loved it. Hopefully I can play this again sometime (and now when I own one, I can play this anytime I want :)

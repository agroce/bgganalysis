RATING: 8
Initial impression. Really enjoyed our 1st play, (4 player). Very much an abstract game, (that might fool some into thinking its not). It is a relatively lengthy game and a little more involved than quick light abstracts, (like the Gigamic line - which I love). So this might only have the staying power for genre fans.

Past that and for my taste this is excellent. Can't speak to player count yet, our only 4 player game made for a relatively tight feeling game board and the end score was 77 - 74 - 42 - 39. That is quite the gap in points. We were all 1st time players with varying game experiences. Look forward to more and updating thoughts. 

Not sure about 1st player advantage in a 4 player game with 3 rounds. With four, players 1 & 2 will go first 5 times and players 3 & 4 will go first 4 times - regardless of that all players get to play the same amount of turns in the game. 

With 4 rounds all players go 1st 6 times, but the game is lengthy as it is so might be best with the suggested - best with 3 players.

Interesting, neat and pretty little game. Almost abstract. Very cool theme and unexpectedly puzzly. On the other hand, players are doing the same thing every turn, until the game ends, which is not that exciting.

A bit overhyped before Essen 2017 in my opinion.

Lovely brain burner abstract with an impactful visual presence. The calm, natural diorama that grows on your table belies the cutthroat gameplay – you should and will block your opponents' trees, and it will hurt when you do. Perhaps a better title would be "Throwing Shade?"

There's one thing that's aesthetically irksome. Throughout the game, small/medium/large trees follow a lovely 1/2/3 pattern through almost every mechanic. They generate 1/2/3 points; the cost 1/2/3 to upgrade; they cast 1/2/3 spaces of shade. It really feels like they should be worth that many victory points at the end of the game.

Presumably they didn't do this for a balance reason. But I think we'll just house rule it in and enjoy our ignorance.

Interesting abstract, but I think I'd rather play [thing=3][/thing] 9 times out of 10. Photosynthesis suffers from being longer than its pleasant artwork and accessible theme would lead you to believe. 

The game gives you limited opportunities to mess intentionally with other players (most of the interaction is limited and happenstance), so it feels a little more solitary than I'd prefer. I'm just not sure who this game is for -- it's too heavy for a family who might play it at a game night, and too light to serve as the main attraction for gamers, while still being too long to really work as a filler. 

I was interested in it, and I'm glad the game exists (the action point mechanism is pretty interesting, at least), but it's just not for me.

Very puzzly abstract. After starting set up this game is entirely procedural with no variance. It just flows in an entirely clear pattern which basically sets this up to be more of a puzzle to solve than a game to be enjoyed. The only way this makes sense is as a pursuit like high level chess where you think insanely hard to predict how a given move will lead to every possible move for the rest of the game. If you enjoy that, good for you, but I don't. If you try to just enjoy it as a fun game, it really isn't. As a game played at all casually it is a perfect example of a runaway leader problem. Someone plays a bit better on the first round or two as a result is generating more sun points each turn which are the currency you need to spend to do anything that will lead to you generating more sun points. Art is very nice though.

RATING: 6
I wanted to like this game, but after two plays, I have to admit I just don't. It's beautiful and easy to learn, but I find myself feeling bored. None of the decisions feel terribly interesting  and runaway leaders tend to continue leading. You can try to block them with your trees of course, but that might force you to make moves that will cost you the game. More than anything, it just felt both too long and too short at the same time. It felt too short in that there wasn't an interesting enough arc, but too long in that I was tired of planting and cutting down trees well before the end of the game. Maybe if there were more routes to victory, that'd make it more fun. But for me, it felt like an hour-long game with enough depth to only justify 30 minutes. I might play this is someone truly wants to, but I don't see myself ever actually wanting to play it again myself.

Glad I finally got a chance to play it.  A good multiplayer abstract (but I don't think I'd want to play it at the full four).  Like most good abstracts, it's fairly opaque on the first play, so I'd need to give it a few more tries to figure out how much I like it.

Love the title, overall theme and the curiously attractive components.  I also like the simple rules.  

The game play, however, is a bit repetitive for my tastes, and our three round game with three players felt to me like it actually should have been shorter, perhaps 30 minutes long, instead of 45-60 minutes.  

On the other hand, the mechanics of considering sun and shade issues did feel fresh.  I think to the credit of the game design, in my first game, I was able to ponder and utilize a particular overall strategy successfully (keep your medium and tall trees around as long as possible until the VP rules, and your desire to win the game, force you to cut them down), such that I won the game with six circle tokens after three rounds. 

I am not a fan of the chop down your tallest most beautiful trees (granted the rules say "end the life cycle") to earn victory points rule set in the game.  As I see it, the art and components are good enough in this game to create a feeling of attachment to your tallest trees, perhaps even in the vast majority of players (including children) who play this game.  That feeling, I believe, should have been honored and/or deepened in the rule set regarding how to earn victory points.  Instead, I guess the old school idea here, is to have us humans nurture and raise amazing lifeforms in order to slaughter or cut them down for our own uses.  Status quoism creating more sorry behaviors.  Sigh.

Played multiple games, two and four-player.
It's very simple to learn, takes about 10min to pickup. Plays in less than an hour even with learning it. The strategy can get pretty deep and is still interesting after multiple plays. Probably my favorite game of 2017.
Components are thick cardboard and high quality. LOVE the detailed illustrations of little woodland birds and creatures on the trees, etc. Appreciated the interior box components that unfold to divide your box into quadrants that help you keep your pieces organized. Still using a ziplock for the tiny light trackers, and point tiles since they don't have their own place within the quadrants.

Great mechanic, artwork, and game.  My only complaint is that the purchase/deploy mechanic is a little clunky.  You both have to buy trees from your board, and then pay again to deploy them.

Have only played this game with one other person. Might get a better score later when i play with more people. But as I think of this I just can’t wrap my mind around why more players would improve the experience, except that it becomes harder and of course for the social aspect of more players. 

The game could, and should have more game mechanics. Different trees could have different abilities. Some being cheaper, some growing easier, some being cheaper at the edges, some at the centre, and so on. And why not add a drafting card deck with happenings, like forrest fires, sicknesses, flooding (some species should handle that better) and drought (some handle thst better). And so on and so on. It would have added more fun to it. If i see an expansion I would like this game much more I believe. Now it just does fall short of 6 points. Although I will definitely play it.

Saw pictures of the game and component and material wise thought i could improve on it so I made my own copy out of wood.

Game play is very clever and subtle. The balance of scoring sun points and blocking your opponent is tricky and the pace of the game making sure you harvest the big trees efficiently but still leaving enough points to do so is knife edge. A very nice game that stays true to it's theme.

Based on one play with four. Interesting idea, great looking game. Felt like it took forever for the game to ramp up and get to speed. Feels like you never have enough Light Points to do anything in the game. As soon as you get harvesting -BOOM, the game ends.

It looks beautiful. Components wise it works. In 2 perhaps a bit too much like chess. With 3 and 4 it works and is a good game. The advanced rules make it a bit better also.

I've played Photosynthesis once as a 4 player game and I didn't like it. It looks fantastic on the table and seems like it could be an interesting abstract game. I bet it would play better with 3 or maybe best with 2? Even so, I doubt it would be interesting enough for me to get excited about it.

To start, players put seeds and a small tree on the board of hexagonal spaces. A sun piece rotates around the board and shines light on the whole board with some seeds and trees being shaded by nearby trees. The way it works, if tree A is shading tree B then tree B will be shading tree A a few turns from now when the sun has rotated halfway around the board. The taller and closer the tree, the more shade it casts on other trees. This means the game is a lot about timing of planting and growing trees to maximize the sun. When trees soak in light, that gives light points which players can use to plant and grow trees. Once a tree is max size, light points can be used to decompose the tree which is the primary way to score points. The more centrally located the tree is on the board, the more points it scores. It also earns more points, the earlier it is decomposed compared to other trees. At the end of the game, players can earn a few points for having leftover light points.

The game is very clean, the rules can be explained in 10 minutes, nevertheless is a very complex competitive game, it could be a 3 or 4 players version of chess or Go. I played almost 10 games and I'm looking forward to play it again. I recommend it to everyone who enjoys a lot of thinking but it can also be played more frivolously, it's a family game after all; even children can learn the rules and play it (i would recommend at least 10-12 years old anyway, for the calculus involved to make the basic moves require a certain level of concentration). And also did I mention that the theme fits perfectely? The board is lovely, the trees are very well made and the concept is so adapt that you will feel like growing your own forest. 10/10 !

RATING: 2
A bad, bad, bad game: even a root canal work is more fun and less painful than Photosynthesys.

I cannot understand how people are supposed to enjoy a game like this, where you only have to autisticly calculate what is the most efficient way to deal with a turn and the only way to interact with your opponents is by indirect means, just by preventing them from gaining something rather than stripping them of everything they have with a direct and hard hit.

Sure, it looks gorgeous on the table but you’ll regret playing it pretty soon: if such games aren’t your suit, there’s nothing to keep you awake here, not even a little banter, as everyone is busy calculating over and over.
And if they are, chances are you’ll be getting pissed off as soon as you realize how easily your carefully planned strategy can be thwarted by a poorly managing player who’s been skipping most of his turns because his sub-optimal choices couldn’t grant him enough «sun points» - as hippie as they sound - to do anything.

A game about growing trees, managing your growth to get the most sun as it moves around and staying out of the shade of the other trees.

Photosynthesis  is an interesting game about growing trees, and the components are great. However, the game suffers from a couple of major flaws.

First of all, one person can fall hopelessly behind early if their trees are blocked from getting sunlight. That person is now stuck in the game for over 30 minutes watching someone else win.

Also, the game lacks variety. There is no randomness, and the starting position is always the same.

Es un juego abstracto de ir plantando árboles y hacerles crecer. La estrategia está en la gestión de las sombras que hacen los árboles, tapando el sol a los árboles de los contrincantes.

Absolutely gorgeous game and components with a truly unique theme. However, the gameplay fell flat for me. It felt like a series of waves where you progressively build your engine and each time you kill one of your large trees, your engine goes down and you have start over again. It didn't feel as satisfying as a pure engine-building game where it gets better through out the game. The game was also a bit too abstract for my taste. Good, light game but not one I'm terribly excited to play again.

This game, while not bad, is just painful to me to play. Entirely abstract and calculable, it just isn't any fun for me. Definitely a runaway leader problem. If you get behind early, that just compounds. Feels pretty easy to know who is going to win early. In a two-player abstract, one can just resign and that's fine, but with multiple players you are stuck playing it out. I think is way longer than 30-60 minutes by the way.

First impressions of Photosynthesis were really great. The game was beautiful to look at. We both liked finding the differences in our trees and player boards. The way it looks on the table is amazing. I love the 3D aspect of its and uniqueness. 

Our game play was slow at the beginning since we hadn't played it before and we were both still trying to get comfortable with the rules but after a few rounds, we were both taking our turns faster. I was only able to play it with 2 players but I'm eager to try it out with more since the shadows and growing would be a lot different with a fuller board. Overall, I really enjoyed this game and am really looking forward to playing it again and with more people.

A nicely themed, elegant game. I liked very much the mechanics with the sun revolving around the earth. Also seeing the forest grow throughout the game gives you very nice feeling. 
Smooth game play with a lot of tactical decisions. There is not a direct interaction between the players, but you need to compete with your opponents for the best spots, and through the whole game the others' trees are standing in the way, so there is an indirect way to give your opponents a hard time.  
Very cleverly punched trees - they don't fall apart when lifted from the table.

Game is far more abstract, brutal, and think-y than it's theme and art make people think. It was nice, but I'm not sure I liked it that much. Jonathan and I suspected from our first play that perhaps sticking to the corners of the board would yield clearly better results? -- Everyone felt it was a learning game and kept seeing moves they should have done on the previous turn, "oh so that's how this game works".

This might look like a light game but it has a lot of complexity.
It is a puzzle within a puzzle, battling for light while also trying to avoid your opponents from getting it.

A good level of thinking in this game. Timing is important as is planning. It's perfect information, like a good abstract should be.

An abstract game themed on growing your own species of trees on a crowded board.  Trees collect “light points” which can be spent on sowing seeds for new trees, or growing existing trees already on the board.  The more trees, and the taller the trees, the more light you gather, and the more you can do.  Neat rules for casting shadows, and a seasonal revolving sun, creates some interesting decisions.  The object to grow your trees to “large” then remove them for victory points - which feels a little jarring considering how long it takes to get them to large!

Okay, and lovely to look at, but didn’t really blow me away.

RATING: 6
After a few turns, I was convinced that I needed to own this.  After a couple of full games, however, I'm pretty sure that I don't need it.  The game is obviously very attractive on the table and theme is strong and the sun/shade mechanism is original.  But the gameplay is pretty repetitive, as you are doing the same thing on each and every turn.  Except the end-game, where you run out of things to do and you just collect income because everything else would hurt your score.   That's not a very satisfying arc.

This is a beautiful game. The theme is very nicely integrated as well. I wouldn't say this is a pure abstract strategy game. It is very easy to teach and has a lot of depth. I think the game has scaled very well and plays better at higher counts.

I think a lot of people are just quite impressed with this game's art. It is an abstract game which found the best fitting theme ever... but still the theme is just a lawyer on top of an abstract game and, in my view, as far as abstract goes, I do prefer them shorter. Photosynthesis, despite being beautiful, over stays its welcome for what is offers. Additionally, the puzzle it offers can be quite deep.. so despite the seemingly light theme, if you approach this game lightly, it will simply look random (like trying to work a rubik's cube)... and if you approach this game heavily, then it becomes too boring and ap inducing. Overall, not a nice mix for me unfortunately.

After 1 play: First of all, this game is beautiful and incredibly satisfying to watch the forest grow and eventually dissapear. The gameplay is also simple enough to learn quickly, but the abstract game that takes place on the main board makes you think several turns in advance and from different angles at each of those turns. 

I love the way this game makes you think and plan. It also has that great passive aggressive satisfaction of growing a tree and blocking an opponent from the sunlight (the game currency) for the next round or two.

I really enjoyed this game. Worth a play.

It's an interesting game with well-implemented abstract mechanics and a very nice aesthetic.  However, it seems like the final round of the game will always pan out the same- harvest a tree then replant, harvest and replant.  It'd be nice if there were other scoring options to allow you to do anything else.

An abstract game with such a lovely theme. My daughters, both 8 years old, were a bit spectical at first, didn't know how to play the game. After two rounds they were growing trees and discussing where to put the next one. Because the sun goes around the board, you'll have some turns with many lightpoints (action points) and some with less. The girls liked this a lot. Even my wife and my mother want to play this game even if they are no-gamers, as the game looks very beutiful on the table.

Only three plays so far and i'm on the fence here about a number of things.  There's no doubting the games aesthetic beauty; it simply looks amazing with the art work, colours and 3D trees all complementing each other perfectly.  It's one of the primary reasons I bought the game.
I was also hooked by the light point mechanism of trees in shade or sunlight.  However, i haven't yet determined how much control the player gets.  Your trees will cluster to some degree, especially at the early stages (seeding from small tree).  When the sun is on the opposite side to a players main tree group, especially when the forest is more mature, that player will see a major dip in light points.  Since the sun moves 360 around the board then every player will likely see this effect.  Yes, trees can be grown to move out of the shade but then likely that player will increase shade to his/her own trees.  It's a uniquely brilliant mechanism but I'll need quite a few more plays of the game to see if clever play can grant the user more control in the acquisition of light points.

Nice theme with gorgeous design that make it's looked really fantastic.
Gameplay are quite dry and a bit too slow on first couple round (I want to buy this tree, I want to spread that seed ..... hey I need more light point!). But it's really high competition at the last round so you have very narrow chance to catch up the leader. We prefer to put it a bit longer by add the fourth round to our game to reduce tension and add more chance to catch up with leader.

Prelim rating. Found the game interesting. It's mostly about trying to get sunlight, which rotates around the board, while blocking others from the same. Sunlight is currency that can be used to grow, and eventually score your biggest tree. Replay value is a big concern because the setup is pretty static.

RATING: 5
Played five times.  Beautiful game, but the endgame is unsatisfactory.  Basically, you have to wipe out your trees to win.  No reason to build any new trees once you reach the third cycle.  I've won all five games by only focusing on building my two large trees right away, then getting the second largest trees on the board.  Then, never remove any trees until the final cycle.  I was able to consistently harvest five to six trees that way each game, and maximized the "light points" each round, especially during the first two cycles.  I don't think there is any other way to play the game.  Any player in the games I've played who harvested earlier than the third cycle lost fairly badly.  Needs an end game that rewards planting new small trees and rewards for what remains on the board at the end.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Solid gameplay that has a classic euro feel.  Competing for light points is rewarding and not too cutthroat.  Game is pretty and nice to look at on the table.  Box is huge and STILL doesn't fit the trees standing up so I am not sure why they designed the box or the trees like this?  Should have been three different sized wooden meeples  or slightly shorter to be accommodated by the box IMHO.

1.11.18 

Players use light points gained from having their trees in direct sunlight to use to buy seeds and trees into their ready area or move seeds and trees from the ready area onto the board. Players score by felling a level-3 tree and taking the highest valued tile that matches that area type. Areas on the edge of the board are worth less than those in the middle.

Great looking abstract that is deep and not quite as mean as people make it out to be. I don't need to own the game but always happy to play.

1.27.18 (2nd play)
Have only played a 3- and 4-player game, but liked the game more at 3 as it was less of a knife fight. Also realized after playing that we got several rules wrong: 
-A space can ONLY be activated once. Throwing a seed on a space means it has been activated.
-Players can buy seeds and trees and play them on the same turn.

RATING: 6.5
Good game, and very interactive (especially with the advanced rules). Everything in this game is player driven, there is no randomness! There is only what you and the other players do within the game... very Chess-like!

The two rules that gets added when playing the advanced game, that the game lasts four whole revelations, and more importantly, that you cannot activate a space that in shadow at the time of activation,  drastically changes the game. It really makes the game twice as hard/deep.

I'm not a fan of games that punish you for playing poorly, by giving you less choices or actions.  This is definetly ones of those games, especially if playing the advanced game. 

That said, I find it tolerable in this game as long as no player gets too much AP. The game can really grind to a halt if one player (or more) needs to think through every possible scenario, which the game unfortunately will reward you for doing... it's that kind of game!

Gotten to the table once so far, played with a full 4 group and all of us felt it kind of dragged with 4 people. There's a lot of downtime between your turns and nothing to do during other player turns.

I'd like to get it to the table a few more time times before I finalize my rating, but so far, we all felt it was a solid 6--nothing wrong with the game, it was fun, but it felt like it went too long for what it was. I'd like to give it a shot with 3 players next time to see if that alleviates the downtime / length of game.

This is an excellent game.  Really nice art, a theme that appeals to wide audience, medium length to play, and not super complex for new players to learn.

Absolutely gorgeous to look at, and there is an actual game under it too.
It's got a bit of an area control/influence vibe to it... with trees. Trees take a while to grow and they need sun! Crazy. It's almost like the game is thematic or something.

Board gets very crowded at higher player counts, which I assume is why it's voted better at lower player counts. (I played it 4-player)

Wow, impressive components and fairly elegant gameplay. I think 4 rounds are required to really get trees growing and have enough time for harvesting. We haven’t been able to grow many trees at once, so either there’s too many trees included with the game, or we are not playing it optimally.

Um, too chess-like? Which is a strange thing to say about a theme-rich game for 2-4. But you have to think several turns ahead to figure out how your choices might work out.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (December 2017)

Photosysntesis has had a lot of hype these days, that coupled by the publisher (Blue Orange who does family games) was enough for me to expect little from it, after I played it, I can say it surprised me. Photosynthesis is better than I was expecting but still not good enough for me to keep it.

Photosysntesis´ rules are easy to teach. You can do it under 8 minutes. Playtime is longer than I wished it was, around 90 minutes with 4 players.

The game´s components are very nice and they look great on the table. Un-punching the game was a mayor pain, it comes with many cardboard trees to un-punch and assemble, but after that, the trees look amazing. The art is very good as well.

The theme is cool and the game´s mechanism do support it very well, this is a rarity in an Euro game.

Gameplay is better than I was expecting but it becomes very repetitive soon. The decisions needed to play the game aren’t obvious, at first they are very interesting but after a while you do the same every round. In your turn you must decide where to seed and which tree to grow, the idea is to grow the trees as fast as possible to convert them into VPs, but you also need the trees to get sun tokens, It is an interesting puzzle to solve and there are a lot strategy to it. In every round, the sun will be going around the board, so the sun that each tree gets will vary, also, you can block or be blocked by your opponent’s trees. I really like the game and the idea behind it, however, I found the game to be very repetitive and too long. I would have liked the game better if it was one round shorter, at the end I was bored by it.

Best with 3 players, with 4 players the downtime is excessive and the game time can increase a lot. I think it can be a pretty good 2 player game.

The replay value seems low.

Bottom line, Photosynthesis is a family level game, but it is much more deep than I initially thought it would be. It is also much better than I was expecting but by the end of the game I was bored by the repetitive actions, it is way too long for what it offers. Downtime could be an issue for me. I could play again if requested, but I already sold my copy of the game, not fun enough to keep.

Nice little simple and clean abstract game which ties to the nature, tree-planting/growing theme quite well.  Rules are intuitive and do not take very long and decisions are meaty enough to keep the game interesting (i.e. where will I get the most sun, whose trees do I want to shade, where should I plant new trees or grow old ones).  Plus the table presence is fantastic !

2019-01-01 -  I feel there's a lot more here than meets the eye in terms of abstract strategy. 2P felt a little empty on the board but the game is actually fairly short in terms of turns so I imagine that several main strategic forks will present themselves after more plays as you really have to optimize light and your turns

This game is thoughtful, beautiful, and deeply strategic. It's also very smartly designed. Easy to teach in 5 minutes and then about 1/2 way through the game players will go "OHHH, I get it now, this is so cool!" As long as they have souls of course :)

I played this game around midnight at SPIEL and it was one of the most Zen things to do. I wasn’t focused on points or winning, but on growing trees and making it look real, so tiny seeds which were overshadowed would hardly grow. Even if played with points I still believe this game delivers. Look at those components and the details like most trees have a small animal in there somewhere.

Area control game with six power phases. The game is very beautiful and uses its theme surprisingly well. Trying to position your treeples in the best manner possible to gather a lot of light and blocking the opposition from getting light is interesting. There seems to be some scriptedness to the gameplay, however. The first player gets to the center if they want to get there and it seems that the best starting strategy is maneuvering a low cost invasion across the board. Not a good game with AP prone players as you should be planning a lot ahead. Seems to work better with three than four and with three everyone also gets to be starting player equally often.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Interesting abstract game with a great theme. There is no randomness, success completely relies on players strategy and ability to anticipate optimal moves.  A true battle of wits.  Not sure how much I would replay this though because each game will play out very similarly.  Players who enjoy high-level strategy games like chess will probably enjoy this.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Just boring. I also have the impression that if you make a bad decision placing the first few trees, there is not much you can do about it in later turns. You will get fewer resources than the other players, and hence you will just lag behind, with no mechanisms in the game to catch up. Also feels like once you played it, you know the optimal moves, and you will just play the same game over and over again.

Szuper absztrakt játék, ami ráadásul gyönyörűen néz ki. Fákat ültetünk, növesztünk, vágunk ki, folyamatosan figyelembe vesszük a napmozgást, a többi fa elhelyezkedését, stb. Alapvetően nagyon egyszerű, de azért van pár kevésbé elegáns szabály. A szabálykönyvböl pedig le kellett tőlteni javítottat, mert a dobozban lévő eléggé lyukas, sok pontosításra, egyértelműsítésre van szükség. Még csak kettesben próbáltuk, de szokatlan módon úgy érzem, hogy a Fotoszintézis olyan játék, ami absztrak, mindenféle szerencsét nélkülöző mivolta ellenére lehet, hogy még jobb is 3-4 fővel.

+ I like abstract strategy games that attempt to integrate a theme
+ The game lacks a catch-up mechanism which is what abstract strategy games are supposed to lack.
+ There is decent player involvement
+ The game is easy to teach
+ The game requires meaningful decisions to win the game

[size=12][b]Why I dislike Photosynthesis:[/b][/size]
- The game is a bit long for an abstract strategy game.
- I think that the replayability could be improved with a more interesting board and more pieces that should change the dominant strategy.

The game offers a lot more I thought it would. It's not a pure family game for families with kids. It's easy to teach but got a lot of meat regarding its gameplay. It's cutthroat and strategic. Definitely want to play again too see more of its complexity. It's a little brain burner because you always have to try not stand in the shadows of other players or your own trees. Love the wandering sun mechanism. It feels fresh! Also shouldn't be that hard to make a deluxe variant out of it with miniature trees of table top gaming.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

We played the base game - not the advanced variant which seems like it would be quite challenging to get trees built in the central part of the board. This is very much an abstract game and it looks quite pretty on the table when the board is full of trees. There is the tension between when to cut down your tall trees for points versus when to leave them up to gain you light points which is the currency in the game. The shade is the blocking part of the game and can be quite aggravating! :-)

I love photosynthesis. Easy to teach, thematic, great depth and lots to think about. I like the light economic strategy involved. The game involves a little blocking which can come off as mean, but I don't really see it hindering the fun factor or approachability of the game. Once you have mastered the rules, the rounds can feel a little repetitive but playing it on the advanced rules always makes this game interesting!

First impression (one learning game & one 2player game).

It's not for us. My SO don't like it at all. The components look fantastic, but we don't have fun playing this game. The decision-making is very dry and leads to AP or to the opposite "being frustrated & just playing something." And I'm not sure about the replayability.  The beginning is very slow and tedious. The decisions during the late game are "harder," but we don't enjoy them. And the playing time is too long for what it is. (First 2p game 90min / sure will be shorter after a couple of games(maybe 45-60minutes). 

At Spiel '17 there will be better abstract games which will enter our collection: 
Azul - we love this game & want to buy it - great random element without luck & the decision-making is fun 
& Santorini - high replayability with the god's cards and shorter playtime

AP prone players beware, you're in for a scare.  Many many options in this game, which can drag with those who are very AP prone.

This is a Spiel winner in waiting. Beautiful production, clever strategic gameplay, easy rules, and a 45 minute play length put this game squarely in my top 10 this year. The game forces you to think vertically as well as horizontally as tree placement in relation to the sun and centre of the board is important but equally important are the shadows cast by trees around you because this affects how much you can do each turn. Brilliant!

First impression after two 3p games, one with advanced rules.  I was very pleasantly surprised by this abstract game.  Aesthetically beautiful, the game combines thematic, artistic, beautiful components and board with clear iconography.   Form and function both work well.  The rules are simple to teach/learn and therefore elegant.  The game is spatial, four dimensional with three axis in the three dimensions and also a time element.  I enjoyed the play with the advanced rules even more than the basic version.  Highly interactive, like all good abstract games.  One criticism I have is that the interaction is somewhat indirect -- once a player seizes a space you cannot displace them, although with the advanced rules you can slow them down (by shading them).  Some elements of a race, and enough complexity to feel challenging, almost too challenging to grasp at the initial plays.  If it weren't an abstract game (which is not my favorite genre) I would probably rate it even higher -- great first impression!  It probably has the same problem as every other zero luck abstract game with fixed board, skill gap and replayability, can't judge without more games under my belt.

RATING: 7
BEAUTIFUL game,  but gets a bit repetitive. Thinky turns can take very long, and the early turns feel scripted: corner trees are obviously superior, making one of them a medium tree on your first turn is a given, and then planting a seed on the 2nd row in a “chess knight-ish” direction your second turn is also almost mandatory. 

Also, one of the two people placing starting trees first tend to always win, as they will be able to get 2 corner trees. This makes four player games problematic, assuming everyone does the correct decision of always picking corners when available.

The sheer beauty of this game makes up for much of this, as well as the very unique sun mechanic. Wonderful theme too - everything feels very on theme and logical, apart from the way shadows work.

RATING: 7
Prelude: Messed up rules in first play --- was taught by another, but was notified by Hjalmar Hach himself (!!) that we'd obviously played wrong when we saw my review --- but can't fault teacher too much as I do think the rulebook was a bit vague on two things:
1) When you throw a seed from a tree, you are activating two locations: the tree that threw the seed, and the location the seed lands. The rules note that you cannot grow the tree that threw the seed, but they should also note that you cannot grow the seed you just threw. Makes a big difference to the game experience!
2) Tree A can be in the shade of tree B, even though tree B is not in the light (since shaded by tree C). Light does not work like that in real-life (i.e. how can B cast shade when not in the light?), so it should have been emphasized with an example.
I recommend 3 players instead of 4; latter is a bit over-crowded. I preferred 3 rounds to 4 as well, though I didn't try both advanced rules together.

Pros: Unique and interesting concept, nice pieces (trees, board). Clean and simple rule set (grow/harvest, throw seed, buy seed/tree). Like the sun and shadows idea. The choice between retaining your sunlight-generating level 3 tree vs harvesting for points is an interesting one; this cyclic nature is nice. Also have to consider that you're surrendering your location to opponents (since cannot harvest and re-plant the same location on one turn), which makes the board continue to evolve even in later rounds when most locations are occupied. A lot more cutthroat (super high interaction) than you would think.

Cons: The restricted number of slots (i.e. trees and seeds being tossed if no spot for them on your board) didn't seem to really add much... not that costly to allow that to happen (at least for seeds and level 1 trees, and never happens for level 3 trees) but it made the game a bit more fiddly (i.e. sometimes people forget and put their tree back into playing area instead of board; we had to be careful). The centre point still seems a bit over-powered. Very hard to look ahead in this game, so tends to be more tactical. Still these are very minor things: enjoyed it and will play again.

Great Game!
However, storage for components is straight up terrible.  It's such a shame that they completely neglected how the components are stored, on a game that is otherwise great fun.  the included "organizers " are cardboard cutouts winch don't fit the components at all!.  It feels like they are designed for a different game.  There is a piece of paper showing all the parts fitting in nicely... They don't fit anything like what it says!  I'm really disappointed about that.

I really like this light, but beautiful game. Your focus is to collect light points by exposing your different sized trees to the sun, which rotates turn by turn. You will then take those light points, and use them to grow your trees, plant new trees, or uproot old trees to score points.

it's very unique in gameplay style, and I really like it a lot. The only thing i'm not fond of is the extra step of having to go from "stock area 1" to "stock area 2" - it feels inefficient and I have to believe there's another way to achieve the same effect but make the gameplay a bit tighter. Regardless, the theme is great, the components are great, and the strategy is pretty fascinating.

Not enough time for meaningful choices. Looks great, but if i can tell half way through the game how the final rankings will be and there is no chance that anything about that will change if not for a huge mistake that someone could make - then that’s just boring. Maybe not such an issue with 4 instead of 3 rounds. But really not sure if I even wanna find out.

11/07/17 Played a four-player game. 
My opinion was generally good.  Its a very nice looking game. I *love* the theme, as its one I hadn't seen before. The rules all seem logical and jibe with the theme. I'm glad I got to play a four-player game. I'd think 3P would suffer some, and 2P I assume is rather staid, due to less player interaction. For the most part if you like games that require meticulous planning and thinking several turns ahead you'll probably like Photosynthesis. If on the other hand you're not into rigid control of your affairs, you may chafe at the game's unforgiving air.  I look forward to playing it again, although not all that often, as it was a bit too "rigid" for me to take often.

Interesting game, literally a growth game. Growing trees, make sure they catch the sun. Get points, spend them again to turn them into growth for your trees. At the same time it is full of interaction: trying to put your opponents trees in the shade. Good game.

Oof.  There's a lot here I want to like but it ends up feeling very slow and fiddling and my first play through locked someone out within the first few turns where it was clear they would never catch up.  Hopefully I can find the right people for this game, but I haven't yet.  It can also cause some serious AP and constantly throws people off by having to buy things off their board to make them available etc.  Why it doesn't just condense those two costs into one I'm not sure since there's only niche reasons to not do so.

Update: Tried this with a totally different crowd and we all had the same reaction.  We wanted to like the game but none of us did.

This game was purchased on a whim. I saw a ~15 second video clip teaser for it and immediately fell in love with the artwork and the very idea of a 3 dimensional, spatial-reasoning game about sunlight and tree height blocking other players AND your own trees as the sun moves.

Only one play thus far, and I got thoroughly stomped - and yet I still adore this game.

Original abstract game where you need to let your trees grow on the most valuable places on the island and bring them down at the right moment to collect points. Beautiful components and easy gameplay if not that easy to master. Love it!

Update, gameplay even gets much better after my initial play, you definitely get better at it how you need to prioritize, not being afraid of letting your trees be put in the box, cutting the trees at the right moment.

I loved this game instantly at GenCon.  I played a demo earlier on Friday, and then won the tournament they hosted later that afternoon.

This game is deceptively easy - it's very fast to learn.  However, the strategy and tradeoffs are wonderful.  You have to quickly decide between maximizing your solar energy (the "grow" ability) or scoring points.  You have to time your moves to the circling of the sun.  You have to plan on when to grow your trees to the next level versus broadcasting seeds.  It's so very much like a much more complex euro game without all the billion little cardboard markers.

This one is so easy to teach as well.  THe concept of a tree "saving" up energy to grow and the tree life cycle is so well known that it just makes sense.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not fun. Very difficult to visualize what gets sun and what doesn't. No luck factor leads to huge AP.  Hard to tell what you are really doing and why you are doing it. Most moves block yourself just as much if not more than it blocks others. It feels like an engine builder where your engine never gets going. Its easy to get absolutely from a turn later on. It stupid that in a game with no luck, there is a huge variability in what the reward tokens are worth. Its horrible that the tokens runout leaving the person who goes last with nothing for their hard work. And sure you could calculate that happening but so much of the game is just sitting around watching other people go into AP hell. Its also extremely antagonistic. A game full of spite and angst without any compensating fun. It is very thematic, though.

Oh and it's long. Well over 2 hours for a game with 4. Not really surprising from this type of game. I expect it to go much longer in future plays now that people know what is going on and aren't just taking random moves.

Surprisingly playable for an essentially abstract game. Your game-play is all about assessing the other players' expected moves and planning far enough ahead to ensure your board position remains dominant enough to harvest continually high resources. You convert those resources into the continuation of dominant position - engine builds a better engine - until the point at which you smash it all down and convert it into points. The earlier you can make that decision without overly affecting board position, the better points you'll collect. Easy to learn, different things to try, but you should be aware that it's a look-ahead challenge-work affair rather than cutesy fun.

I like this game. It's dripping with theme with a decent amount of strategy. But, light enough that you can teach your parents or anybody else that hasn't played something like this before.
However, the biggest downfall of the game is replayability in my opinion. Strategy seemed repetitive, but slightly varies based on different players. There is much more material then game that is in this box. Components are great, but I wasn't overwhelmed by the game itself.

Photosynthesis is a game where players try to grow their trees in the forest in a way that maximizes the sunlight they receive. The sun rotates around the game's hex board, and trees in line of sight of the sun (that is, that aren't blocked by other trees of the same or greater stature) gain income according to their height. This income is used to activate trees from their player board, and then used with those activated tree pieces to grow the trees on the board. When a tree reaches its maximum height, income can be expended to remove the tree entirely for big points depending on how close to the center of the board it is--this is where most of the points come from. I thought this game was very clever, and you had to think very tactically to maximize your income. However, I wasn't a huge fan of the end-game--if you're not set up correctly, everything you do for the last few turns may not be worth any points.

There is surprisingly more depth to this game than you would think on first sight (especially playing with the advanced rules). In the essence it's a mild abstract strategy game with a little engine building, anticipating other players' actions, and you have to get your timing right. So, a little of everything in a small time-span: great!
Some remarks: there can be some analysis paralysis and I'm not sure about how the game holds up after some plays, since strategies seem limited.

This was an enjoyable game.  I liked the different options of using points and playing against the sun and others to obtain them.  It was very strategic and cutthroat.  The board was beautiful.

Game end (after playing a shorter three round game) had everyone's scores based on harvesting three trees and sun points.  Don't know if a fourth round would get some separation, however felt that it was more of a race to the middle and harvesting first over blocking.

Deceptively aggresive game. You might think growing trees is nice and friendly. Plant a seed, grow a tree, have it grow bigger and enjoy. You'd be wrong. 
The game is about capturing sunlight. The more light you grab, the more trees you can grow. It's war with trees. 
The game looks really nice and works very well. Unfortunatley I think it's not very re-playable. Second time you play it you should know what to to, and after that it's just who can make the same strategy work better. 
But, if you want to surprise your friends with a really cute looking wargame, this is for you.

I don't like giving such a low rating to a game I have enjoyed playing several times, but the rules and design issues are too staggering to ignore in this potentially great game.
*the english-language rulebook is riddled with ambiguities and inaccuracies. Download the one off BGG for a better version.
*the endgame condition in the rules is worse than the version the designer actually wanted (2 scoring tile piles depleted in the 4p game, which is far more interesting)
*the game is hard to put away and the "bins" for the beautifully-designed trees will damage them in the longrun.
*The manual needs to include recommendations for when to use the different optional rules. For instance, we played a game with the advanced shade rules, but only 3 rounds, and I think it was objectively too short.

This game feels rushed to production. I am confident that, with the information I am gathering from the BGG forums, I can arrive at the ideal ruleset for this game, but players should not be required to put in all that work in order to arrive at a playable game. This review is not a "4." This review is a "9 - 5".

Have to admit being pretty impressed. I thought I'd enjoy this going in but it was surprisingly even better than I expected.
The theme is both unique and strong. Actions make sense, the mechanics fit the theme, and the vivid components really add to the effect.
As far as gameplay goes, it's really chess-like. By that I mean, there's no chance, it's fully deterministic (if you played again with everyone making the exact same moves, you get the exact same outcome). There is some AP to the game and it can get quite "thinky" but, at least for me, that's a strong positive.
Highly recommend as something both gateway and hardcore gamers can enjoy together.

While I certainly wouldn't say I'm disappointed with this game, it perhaps isn't quite as great as I thought it might be based on some reviews. That said, it's without doubt a good game, with solid mechanisms and interesting strategy and tactics to be explored. A couple of things keep it from greatness to my mind, though. First, while the theme is interesting and novel, it doesn't quite work fully for me. For example, the time scale on which the game operates feels kind of wonky and the shade rules don't quite ring true. Of course, theme is always abstracted in a board game but here it felt more obvious to me. Second, there's a level of sameness to each game of Photosynthesis which I find a little higher than in most games I rate more highly. I should reiterate in finishing, however, that this is in no way a bad game and that I do enjoy playing it. I'm just not sure it quite lives up to some of the hype it has received.

RATING: 8
In this game, players play as trees, who want to grow tall and then fall over for points. Each turn the sun moves, and gives action points to whatever trees can see it and get light. These action points are then spent unlocking components from your player board, planting new seeds and growing existing trees. Nothing can happen when a spot is in the shade, so there's a lot of blocking of other players with strategic growth. The most important thing in the game is once a tree is at the third level, which blocks the most and collects the most sun, and therefor is in it's most valuable state, you can spend points to have it fall over, then you collect a points chip from the pile that matches how deep into the forest it was. The center space is the most valuable, but it's nearly always in shade making it the hardest to grow from. The components are beautiful cardboard-papercraft trees, the rules are easy and intuitive yet this is a brutal game with tons of player interaction.

Had a fantastic time thus far playing this. First off, the game is gorgeous. All the trees on the board make this a very inviting game that looks great on a table. The theme is very strong with this one as the rules make lots of intuitive sense and the gameplay really does model a bunch of trees fighting for sun to be able to grow the most. 

I can see this rising even higher in my ratings with repeated plays. There is a lot of player interaction in this game and it can be a bit brutal but that is part of why I love it. You have to fight your opponents for the best spots and the most sun and you'll undoubtedly be blocking each other before long. 

I've only played with 4 players thus far but think it probably is best at that number. Not sure I'd enjoy the 2 player game very much as I think I'd find it too open--the intense competition for sunlight at 4 players makes for a very fun and tight game. 

This game is also very easy to teach due to the limited rules and intuitive nature of them. I foresee playing this one often and probably rising to a 9 or even a 10.

Terrific game! My son got this for Christmas (from Santa) and we just finished playing our first game. Even though I lost, I thoroughly enjoyed this game. Easy to learn, but some subtle strategies make it quite interesting. And how can you not like a game that involves planting seeds, growing trees, and throwing "shade"? Careful planning and timing are required to make your tree harvesting productive (i.e. winning points). Lots of fun.

I'm not a huge fan of abstracts.  While this game looks pretty cool on the table, it just doesn't offer the type of puzzle I'm looking for in a game.

Oddly, I enjoy it at more players even though it's a bit cut-throat - which is generally not an aspect of a game that I prefer.

Whoa! I was really blown away by this game. The first thing to notice is the beautiful artwork, quickly followed by the amazing components and table presence. Surely, the game isn't going to be able to hold up to that, right... wrong. Fantastic game play! The planning and efficient use of your light points in this game is crucial. Analysis Paralysis players will have a hard time with this game if they try to math out every possible move. Probably best as a 2 player game, as someone might get ganged up on in a 3-4 player (by accident or not). If you plan good enough, maybe that's preventable. The rotating sun makes for a fantastic game play and impossible to protect your position from all angles. Love Love Love. I expect my ranking to go up the more I play this.

This game commits one of the worst crimes for a game these days. Extremely AP turns where you can do as many actions as you can afford combined with not really being able to plan out your turn in advance. Because the board situation can change drastically, you have to spend time analysing the board before even starting to plan out your turn. It's been a long time since I've seen this much useless downtime in a game. My wife nearly fell asleep waiting for her turn in a 4 player game. The two player game was flat out boring, both players just wanting it to end well before the third revolution of the sun finished.

A unique theme with interesting mechanics.  Early mistakes can really cost you later on.  It's sometimes beneficial to just have the seeds occupy a spot and not do anything till the very end.

Very well-thought concept. Clever and original. I like the whole look and feel of the game, but it is not easy (even hard) to keep the overview once the game board gets crowded. It's also a very unforgiving game: I found it far from evident to recover from a mistake made early on in the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I want to rate this higher, because I absolutely love the theme, and it definitely feels different than most games I've played. However, I didn't quite enjoy how you had to keep unlocking things again and again and again, as opposed to them being available after you unlocked them once, and how you pretty much had to kill your light collecting engine as soon as you built it in order to get the only way to score points in the game. It felt like if someone was slightly more optimized early on in the game it tended to provide an advantage that applied for the rest of the game that it was difficult for others to catch up to as well. If it was a short game, then I'd be okay with that, but it's thinky enough that the game took quite awhile, and I didn't feel like I had a chance to ever take the lead again (I did get close, though). Maybe I'll feel different after I play it a couple more times, though.

Basically I think I want this game, but with some sleeker and less punishing rules, and with a bit stronger of a way to get yourself back into the game if you're behind.

:thumbsup: At first glance the theme makes you go like [i]”Wait what....”[/i], yet it delivers interesting area control-like gameplay.
:thumbsup: An eye-catcher on the table. I love how four player colors are provided without hurting the foresty look of the game.
:thumbsup: Rules are easy to explain and the gameplay is fun. Gamers will want to play with the two extra rules listed under ‘advanced rules’ at the back of the book. Without those two rules, this becomes a very family friendly game that might be a tad boring for (experienced) gamers.

Had a 3-player-game (seems to be the sweet spot) which was a really nice one. It's abstract and thematic ... both at a time! Outstanding beauty in its components.

Solid, strong and tactical. With 4 basic rules, Photosynthesis offers you a rich, tactical and crunching experience. 

For the light rule system, this game offers way more than I thought it would! The strategies are rich and you have many options available during the game to tweak, budge and change tactical choices.
The turning of the sun forces the economy (gathering of light points) for everyone into highs and lows, as if it were a seasonal thing.

Also I have to mention the artwork. It is a beautiful game. Each tree is neatly packed with nice easter eggs like animals and mushrooms between the roots and leafs, and the end result of the gameplay is a rich forest filled with colourful trees. 

Easily one of the best games of 2017! Not because of minis, big rulebooks or many options, but by its elegance, its lightness and its depth.

[6 plays] This is a beautiful game to play and far more to the strategy than the simple rules would imply. I look forward to playing this many more times with players who are challenging each other with all kinds of different tactics.

Works equally well with 2, 3, or 4 players. 4 revolutions of the sun rather than 3 makes for a better game I think. Have yet to try the shadow growth restriction variant.

Fun, easy-to-learn forest warfare Euro. Emphasis on the "warfare" part — 4 player games get shockingly bloodthirsty as people scramble for the high-point interior spaces.

The core mechanic is depriving your opponents of sunlight so your enjoyment will probably depend on your group's "meanness." My main group loves aggressive tactics so it's been a big hit, one we'll probably play pretty frequently because of the short playing time and easy set-up.

Played this game finally with my fiance and best friends. I am the heaviest gamer, while the rest are pretty unfamiliar with modern and heavier board gaming. 

The game was enjoyable. Definitely the type of game where two plays through is necessary, since the strategies are actually a bit complex, despite simple mechanics. The art and theming is beautiful, the iconography is extremely helpful. I was able to frequently point to it when players had questions and things. 

The idea of having to buy a tree/seed first and then also pay to place it confused others at first. I think explaining it as "Your board is a store, and over here is your inventory. You can only plant things from your inventory, so you need to buy things first" can really help out.

The gameplay was relatively enjoyable. One I would play again, but not really urgent to play. A bit more fun if you play epic battle music and pretend that this is a cut-throat war between tribes of trees.

This is a very cleverly themed game that's really an abstract at heart. I'm not usually a fan of abstracts but I liked this very much. Maybe in part because, as usual for Blue Orange, it's gorgeous! And unlike most abstract games this one has an interesting economic (and spatial) engine. And, it supports 4 players well! I won, too -- yay me!

Like Ubongo Extreme, working with hexes is tricky at first. Everyone struggled to figure out exactly how the light would shine, which trees would get light and which would be starved. Once you get past that, though, you can start actually playing the game: planning a turn or more in advance to grab a good spot to earn light, decide when to convert a tree from light-earner to VP, how to manage the flow of trees from Supply to Available to board to Supply.

Players each represent a species of trees growing in a forest. Trees come in 3 sizes (1-3), as well as seed form. Everyone starts with several seeds and trees in their Available pools, and the rest on personal Supply boards (where, for each size of tree, costs escalate as supply diminishes). During setup, you'll place several trees onto hexes of the large hex board (one hex larger than Catan, i.e. 4 hexes per edge). The sun starts on one vertex of the hex, extending along the 2 adjacent edges of the board.

Each round, players first collect light points: the sun shines down the rows of hexes. Trees cast shade behind them a number of hexes equal to the size of the tree (1-3), blocking light from any tree of equal or smaller size. If your tree is not blocked, it collects light equal to its size. Then, in turn order, players may spend their light in several ways (may act on any specific hex only once, though):
- place a seed (cast in straight lines away from a tree a distance up to the tree's size -- revised rules: straight lines not required) into an empty hex of the forest
- acquire seeds/trees from Supply into your Available pool
- grow a tree in the forest (pay light equal to next size up)
- retire a size 3 tree for VP (closer to island center earns more VP)
All seeds/trees that come out of the forest (by growing/decaying) go back to Supply, where they may later be reacquired.

At the end of the round, the Sun rotates to the next vertex. 6 rounds marks a year (sun rotated completely around the forest). The game ends after 3 years. Remaining light points convert to VP (3:1), and most VP wins!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is an abstract game about growing trees.  I'm not usually a fan of really pure abstract games which this certainly is but this one really won me over.  In this game players take turns placing seeds and growing them to 3 different sizes of trees.  The resource spent to do all these actions is sunlight and the larger the trees on the board each round the more sunlight that player receives.  The catch is that the sun moves around the board each round and trees cast shadows depriving other trees of acquiring this sunlight resource.  This makes for very interesting decisions and a pretty workable theme in a purely abstract game.

My one play of this game was with 2 players and it was quite combative as we tried to starve each other of sunlight and grow trees on the most valuable spaces.  The game plays up to 4 and with more players I'm sure this charming little game about growing trees can get quite cutthroat with larger player counts.

And as I said above, the game is very charming, adorable even.  Everything is cardboard but it really works in this package.

I wanted to like this game, but after playing a 4-person game at my local store, I was disappointed in the actual play.  I made some early mistakes, including during the initial placement of starting trees, and very quickly it became clear that there was no catch-up mechanic and no real way I could fight back into competitiveness.  It may be that 4 players is too many for this game, given the hexagonal board; I was irreparably tangled with one other player while the other 2 were able to keep to their own little sectors and score big points.

This game is gorgeous! Players take the responsibility of planting trees in a central forest with other players. Your trees collect sunlight and store that energy to grow new forestation. 

The rulebook is just a couple pages long, so it is easy to understand and learn. The twist is that as sunlight is collected, trees cast shadows on other trees that block sunlight. This game has a surprising amount of depth, requiring a lot of planning to make sure you can score points without losing your ability to collect sunlight.

I have played this with both gamers and non-gamers, and it has been a smash hit with anyone that has played the game. Very fun, very beautiful, pristinely designed game.

Photosynthesis is a strikingly beautiful game, with trees of all colours and sizes vying for the best positions in the forest to get sunlight. That's probably the neatest thing about this game - the sun (represented by that undernourished cardboard Pac-Man piece) moves around the board each round, casting light on some trees, which in turn cast shadows and block sunlight to trees behind them. It's a fight for growth in the world of plants. The only thing this game lacks is David Attenborough narrating the game rules.

Very interesting theme, 2017 really has been the year of thematic abstracts. For now it does lack some of the intuitiveness of other abstracts I enjoy, and forward planning can be quite hard. But it is unique, fun and very intriguing. Plus trying to figure out when to harvest or keep your large trees around for blocking/light points, and also when blocking is more optimal, is highly enjoyable. As of yet I am very unaware of what the most optimal strategies are and how to effectively shut down your opponents (and if you can, or even if doing so is worth your while) but I look forward to exploring the game more and trying to figure out these finer elements.

This isn't really my kind of game: a multiplayer abstract where nothing you do matters.

You can make the optimal tree placement, but as the sun moves around that placement eventually becomes bad because your trees always get blocked at some angles. I know that this is the point of the game, but it just doesn't feel fun.

Usability issues: remembering which spaces have been "activated" is a pain and remembering to put trees back onto your board (instead of into your reserve) after removing them proved to be a problem. There's also a big misprint on the player boards regarding end of game light points where every row shows the wrong point value.

If you take the middle space, which is the most valuable, it makes sense to just leave your seed there for the whole game and then grow and harvest that tree at the end. Otherwise you would just be giving your opponents a chance at a lot of points. That tree would be blocked from getting light at almost any angle, so growing it early in the game wouldn't be any benefit.

Not my kind of game to begin with, then add the usability issues and the "lock down the middle space" tactic and this isn't something I want to play again.

An abstract game that generates light as currency. I love the aesthetic of the game as it draws people in and reminds me of Arboretum. I quite enjoyed it.

The mechanics itself made sense as you collect light in order to buy/plant seeds to grow trees. You will have to balance between collecting light or cutting the tree for VP. It plays smoothly and can be played within an hour.

However, don't let the appearance fool you as it can be a cutthroat game. You are constantly blocking opponents as your tree grows larger. If you don't mind a bit of "take that" then I would recommend you give this one a try!

Wife and I have played this multiple times now. Ill admit, the quality of this game is wonderful, with beautiful artwork and excellent components, however, the gameplay, at least for 2 players is just.....meh. It's dull and lifeless, which is ironic given the theme. If you have 4 players, I truly believe this would be a better game, but if you dont, its worth trying or playing a demo copy, but not owning.

Excellent game play, easy to learn, unique, and interestingly strategic. Also, plays well with 2 players as it tightens the game play (having two consecutive moves).

This is a great game for advance players and to teach new comers, It draws you in with a unique concept and keeps you with a slow burn type game play that sees you develop seeds to trees and then the mad dash for points.
+ Rules are simple to learn and make sense. ( One of the biggest complaints I have heard was how the shading works in the game. How the sun shines at an angle and not from the side. I tried to play a game where the "sun shines at an angle and how real shade works" and it played fine, but it makes it harder to gain sun, which in turn makes the game not as exciting. I understand why the rules are the way they are regarding to the sun and shadows because it just makes it more simple and less confusing when acquiring sun, especially for newer players)
+ The game looks great, especially when you are in late second round and third round when a lot of the trees are out.
+ The game is a simple strategy if you want it to be or a super complex strategy if you are into that. What ever floats your boat.
- Though I have enjoyed every time I've played it, after a few games, it doesn't have the same draw power that other games keep game after game. It is a game I will play with new people to introduce them to more complex games, but after playing it with a game group a few times, it will take the back seat to other games that continue to draw a group in.
Overall, I love it! and look forward to all the playthroughs.

More on the Sun at an Angle rules I played with.
    Instead of trees being blocked if they are behind a tree and not taller than the tree in front. Ex. Tree A is a 1 level tree, Tree B is a 1 level tree, and Tree C is a 2 level tree. A is in front (in the adjacent space) of B, therefore A receives 1 sun point and B receives 0 sun points. Tree A is in front (adjacent) of C so Tree A receives 1 sun point and C receives 2 sun points because level 2 tree is above a one.
With the sun at an angle, I played it like this using the same examples as above. A blocks B just like above, but if A is in front of C, then A receives 1 sun and C would receive 1 sun because C's lower half is shaded and would not receive sun. Another example would be if there is a D tree that is a 3 level three that is two spaces away from (one empty space between the trees) the tree that is in front. Tree C is in front with tree D two spaces away. C would receive 2 suns but because C cast a two space shadow, but at an angle, D would get 2 suns because the first space behind C would have a two shadow, the space behind that would be a one shadow because the sun is at an angle and the tree would not cast a two level shadow over two spaces like the actual rules are. 
This is probably a jumbled mess for anybody reading this but, it makes sense once you look at an actual board and test it out. But just know that you tend to get less sun this method with makes the game harder as your resources are more limited. I see why now that the makers chose to go with the way the rules are set as the game moves quicker and it is a lot more simpler to find out how much sun you get.

After several 2P plays, started to feel the competition for the center of the board. 
Feels like the 2P experience needs an Automa or a board mod such as diff neutral trees randomly placed before a game to change the board.

A good game with a very original theme and great components. It's mechanically very elegant, however the game feels like it could be easily optimizable so I'm not quite sure about the replayability. Turns can be quite long as well, and the last round can be anticlimactic as often you may be unable to harvest a tree at that point and investing in new trees doesn't make any sense.

Great components, presentation, and theme. But the rules are inconsistent and they have ambiguities. They do not flow well. I wish the designers had spent more time to make the game flow like the life of a tree. Pleasing for the eye, but gamers will find it less satisfactory from what it could have been.

I had seen Photosynthesis being played and was intrigued. I'd also heard it described as a "thematic abstract" which seemed an intriguing combination. So when I had an opportunity to play, I was intrigued.

Photosynthesis is about growing trees and getting sunlight. There's a board which starts from a central hex and expands out in a series of rings from there. The game is played over a series of rounds. Each round the sun revolves around the board casting light onto trees. The size of your tree determines how many "sun points", i.e. money, you get. A small tree gives you 1 point, a medium tree gives you 2 points, and a large tree gives you 3 points. However, if another tree blocks your tree you might not get any sun points because you're in the shade. A tree blocks yours if it is at least the same height and is x number of spaces in front of it where x is equal to 1 for a small tree, 2 for a medium and 3 for a large.

So each turn, the sun rotates, players collect sun, and then they can spend sun to do stuff. That stuff can be to put seeds on the board, turn a seed into a tree, change a small tree to a medium, medium to large, etc. Except that you have a bank of your unbuilt trees and you have to spend sun points to get the trees from your bank to your available area before they can be placed on the board. So you will often have to first get the tree to your available stock, then upgrade the tree on the board (which goes back to your bank) into the new tree, paying sun for both actions. Each player does all of his sun stuff and then it moves on to the next player in turn order. There's a lot of thinky "how can I block other people's trees"/"how are the people after me going to block my trees" calculations that you need to think through.

The point of all these machinations is that if you ever kill off a large tree you'll get points based on how close to the center the tree was. There's a dynamic tension to wanting to leave large trees on the board to get sun and the fact that the points you get for killing tress decreases as more players take that option. (Each ring on the board has a separate stack of tiles arranged from highest points to lowest)... so the first person to kill a 2nd ring tree might get 14 points while the next will get 13, etc.

In our game players sort of "took corners". So during part of the "year" the sun was on your side and you got lots of sun, while some other players hardly got any because your trees largely blocked theirs. And then later in the year their tress blocks yours and the inverse was true. So there was an odd cycle of feast and famine.

I liked the game. It is the kind of abstract thinking thing I enjoy. Thematically, tress getting sun and making shadows to hurt other tress makes perfect sense and is brilliant. The spending sun to pull unbuilt trees out of your tree bank is wonky and makes no thematic sense, but that's okay... it's just a gamey thing that had to be in there to make the game work. Other players felt the game might have some issues... it's hard for me to say off this first play. I'd want to try it again before passing judgement one way or the other. Our game was very tight and decided on a tie-breaker.

RATING: 4.5
There are games that simply don't fit you - games that don't have a particular issue in the mechanics, that aren't broken, unbalanced or even lack originality. [thing=218603][/thing] is one of those to me.

The production is very pretty and well done, with many nice details spread throughout the board and components. It also has a neat "shadow" mechanic which brings most of the thought and interaction, as small trees in the shadow of one of the same size or bigger don't provide income of light (the currency of the game). While [thing=218603][/thing] is mostly abstract, the chosen theme is present and makes sense.

However, with perfect information, the play dwell into an effort to calculate position, growth and blocking in order to maximize every action. This, of course, leads to much analysis and its brother, downtime. With 4 the play took way too long for what it offers, as the considerations remain the same, only with the board becoming more crowded. The plays repeats itself: plant seeds, growth, income and then back again.

I take no joy in waiting and trying to find the perfect calculation/math/position to have the best income possible. And although I like interaction in games, [thing=218603][/thing] brings the one that has a grave danger: often is in your best interest to hurt someone already lagging behind, not even because you want to, but simply because that person have trees next to you. 

In the end, [thing=218603][/thing], though beautiful, easy to learn, with novel mechanics and smart gameplay, lacks attraction for me, being too long for what it provides, too mathy and low on the fun side. Will likely avoid in the future, specially in 4 players.

The rules are very simple and the game very much feels like a competition to get the tallest trees in the best positions. Knowing when to harvest the trees and how to take advantage of an ever changing board is key. Blocking sunlight from reaching opponents trees is also very important. It does appear to run on a bit with 4 players, but I expect it could be kept down to 60-90 minutes with 4 experienced players.

I keep winning this, and my wife is struggling with liking it for that reason, but I love it. It's different, quick, and of course the theme is cool. There are chances to catch up, since the action can come in waves--withstand a period of watching your opponent take more actions, then spend the currency ("light points") you've been saving up on a wave of your own. Interesting economy of currency and "workers," often it's the right choice to just throw trees away instead of making space for them--the game will end before you'll need them anyway. Not sure how much play my wife will want to keep giving it at 2p; would be interested to try at 3 and 4, there's some depth to explore.

Spent a lot of time debating whether to get this as it has come in for some heavy criticism for being a 'system' game, prone to runaway leads. I can honestly say that's having played it with 3 other seasoned gamers, we could see how that mechanism worked, and we all Sussex it early on, but the game still played beautifully and smoothly and we all had a great time. It looks amazing on the table, it feels great both mechanically and from a production point of view. The theme is amazing and works really well so long as you suspend your o level physics/optics knowledge, but that dowsn't matter a jot. It is one of the prettiest games you will own, and the game design is really nice. Treat yourself.

1st Impression: Different, but in a good way. Despite the zen theme and appealing artwork, this is a brutal, cutthroat economics game. The rotating sun makes for a unique puzzle, which is very interesting. One drawback is the lack of randomness - the completeness of your information set is only limited by your ability to correctly determine the material plays of the other players. This might bog down the game with more competitive or AP-prone players.

A beautiful and surprisingly strategic game focused on positioning new trees in a grove.

Nice production quality.  The cardboard is all matte finish (which I prefer over glossy) and everything fits into the box without taking the trees apart.  When we first started playing I felt like 3 rounds (4 rounds with more players) wouldn't be enough to get much done, but I ended up surprised at how it all started coming together late into the 2nd round.  I think this will be easy to teach, but experienced players will develop a better sense of timing and strategy and know when to plant, grow, and sell.  I definitely would/should have pushed growing and selling ahead of planting a few times when I didn't on my first play.  2P is very enjoyable, but I can see how competitive (more challenging) it will get with 3-4P.

Don't be fooled by comments calling this a lighter, shorter game- they're not playing with the advanced rules, which is where the real game is at. If you like spatially involved action point games like Reef Encounter or Java you'll like this, and similarly to those I'd stick to 3p to avoid downtime and chaos. Growing trees towards the center of the board becomes difficult as the game goes on, but seems highly desirable as scores thus far have tended to be close at the end so the numbers on the tiles have mattered. There is a lot of balancing your own strategic plans with tactical opportunities that arise to deprive your opponents of income.

THIS LOOKED AMAZING AT GENCON (2017). Sold out every day. I watched a demo, the basic gameplay seems simple but the placing of trees seemed strategic on an almost GO like level, which is cool. I wish the trees weren't that crappy two-pieces-of-slotted-cardboard though; the artwork/color/print job on them was nice and all, but they still just looked like cardboard. I'm hoping for like a deluxe edition or for Meeples to make like wooden trees or something. Or maybe I could just replace them all with miniature train trees from like Hobby Lobby or whatever.

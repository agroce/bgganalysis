A fun party game of picture drawing.  Thankfully picture quality is immaterial to success.  Winning has more to do with careful listening, interpretation and luck.  Lots of fun, particularly with those who are artistically challenged.  Would gladly play again.

RATING: 6
The game is advertised as a drawing game where drawing skills aren't required.  As effective as a marketing job that it is, it is misleading.  Player do need to be able to draw somewhat.  Stick figures are good enough.  The key to the game is really listening.  This is particularly hard since the person describing the image doesn't know what is important either.  As a party game, this works well - but not for a noisy one.  Its kind of an after dinner party style of game.

Duplik is the modern version of Pictionary: one player describes a scene while the others try to draw it.
Then 10 questions about the picture originally described are read aloud, and players score points for each point correctly drawn.
Quite a fun activity, even with kids!

A very fun game even if you can't draw a straight line.

We have really had a lot of fun with this one.  There really is no upper limit on number of players.  The scoring will be messed a little if everyone doesn't get the same number of turns, but who cares if you are just playing for fun.  This is hilarious as you get to see how people interpretated the same image descriptions.

RATING: 7
A very fun and funny drawing game that requires very little artistic ability.  I love how the artists don't feel as much pressure because victory isn't about how good your drawing looks, but simply if you included key details.  In fact I wonder if the game is actually harder for the portrayer than the artists.  Getting all the details described clearly, and at a pace that the artists can handle, is a real challenge in only 90 seconds.

I appreciate that the rules seem to be written with every detail taken into account, so that even a group of gamers can play.  However I think we prefer to score on an honor system.  Having someone else "grade your paper" just seems so silly, especially since some of your drawings may be a little difficult to identify.  Also some people may get frustrated with portraying or drawing and just give up, so there might be some people who shouldn't try this game.  Otherwise this game is a delightful time that will get everybody laughing.

RATING: 7.5
Fun, funny, and frantic. While the sand in the timer dwindles, the Director describes a scene for the other players to draw. When time runs out, he stops directing and everyone must put down their pencils. Then the Director reveals 10 previously unknown criteria by which each picture will be judged. Score a point when a detail in your picture matches one of the criteria. The director scores for each of the criteria that has been met.
This game can be some of the most fun you'll ever have playing a drawing game, as long as you are playing with a group of teens/adults. Tried it with younger kids (8-12) and it proved too difficult for most of them.
Would rate higher if the replay value wasn't so limited; once you've seen all of the cards, you've got a huge advantage over new players.

A game of trying to draw/sketch a duplicate image simply based off of clues given by the "caller" who is looking at the actual image.  Cannot remember how points work and if it was balanced, but I'm a bit of a sucker for drawing games.

Es un juego de dibujar. Todos los jugadores son dibujantes, excepto uno que es el director. El director coge una ficha en la que aparece una escena y tiene que describir la imagen durante un minuto y medio y los dibujantes deben tratar de reproducir el dibujo. Cuando ha finalizado el tiempo, cada dibujante pasa su dibujo al otro y entonces cada dibujo es evaluado conforme a una serie de requisitos que figuran en la ficha del dibujo que leyó el director. Un requisito está bonificado. Los dibujantes ganan puntos por los requisitos cumplidos y el director también gana puntos si algún dibujante cumplió un requisito. Después, el rol de director se desplaza a la izquierda y continua la partida hasta q todos han sido directores una vez. Sencillo y divertido. Recomendable para la familia.

Portrayal.   

This game seemed fun the first time I played it, but not quite so innovative the second time.   It's entertaining to see what players end up drawing.  Unfortunately, the cards vary hugely in difficulty and fairness from one to the other, so there's really no fair comparisons or contest at play here.   That's okay though, as long as you go into this one understanding that it's an entertaining exercise rather than a game.

Initial rating a 6, although I'd call it a 6+.

Awesome party game!  One person describes a picture that everyone else has to draw, all within 90 seconds.  Afterwards, a set of 10 criteria for the pictures are revealed, and everyone scores points for each criteria that they met.  If you're afraid of having to draw well, don't worry, you don't have to be any good at drawing to do well!  Also, don't play with people that are going to be rules lawyers and nitpick whether someone met a criteria or not.  This game is not for them.

Based on 1 play:

Pretty decent party game, where thankfully you don't actually have to be good at drawing to do well. Timer seems a bit short but our scores were actually quite high so maybe it's just perception.

You definitely do better at this game (particularly at giving clues) if you've played before and know what kinds of things are likely to be on the list.

Portrayal is a simple concept that doesn't seem like it's going to be all that fun...until you play it.  Then you latch onto the silliness of what's happening and the laughter starts.

The clever twist in this game is psychological - you just don't know what details one player focuses on, and will other players pay attention to them?

Definitely a fun game.  My only hesitation is on replayability - once you've played a card you're unlikely to want to ever use it again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Components: The pictures are great, as are the numbered details ranging from obvious to very particular. Seems there are enough cards to last many games.

A few production flaws keep it from being perfect. First, special care must be taken to not spoil any images. I'm having to develop my own system to ensure used cards are kept separate from the fresh cards, and that cards aren't spoiled as they are handed to the next player.

Second, the scoring is cumbersome. The bonus question seems fiddly and random. The scoring for the art director is accomplished much more easily by just asking the player who scored the most points to identify which questions they missed, and ask if anyone else got those correct; recording a matrix of every person's answer to every question is time consuming and unnecessary. The scoring boxes themselves could be simpler, just as the numbers 1-10, and players could circle the numbers corresponding to correct answers. When we run out of custom score sheets, we can take this approach.

Just played where there's no random bonus question, players score one point for each correct answer, and the art director gets points equal to the highest score that round. Makes things much simpler.

Experience: Super fun. As the art director, it is challenging to list quickly every important detail, and in a logical order: rough outlines of where things will go, then finer details to fill in the spaces. As an artist, there is lots of guesswork, and anticipation of information. It's fun to visualize an image I've never seen. Seeing everyone's drawings in the end is lots of fun, noting who captured the details correctly, but also how similar all the images are.

New version of Identik (which had better components). Duplik has one of those red, transparent decoder screens to reveal the ten hidden criteria  - this is impossible to read if your eyes are over 40 years old.

RATING: 7
Great party game.  Generally I'm not excited about party games, but I like this one.  And, up to 10 players  

A drawing game where you don't have time to be an artist.  In 90 secs you must draw in simple form what is described to you in detail--and then of course, there is judging & perhaps voting--not on your drawing but on whether or not you included the elements (& the secret Super Element) described to you.  

This game is great because unlike other games, such as Pictionary or Charades, you are not required to be original and think of the clues yourself.  It's is more relaxed gaming.  When everyone sees the actual picture, there in lies a lot of fun.

It is also a nice game to play as people are arriving for the evening because the length of game is easily modified--and if you are just doing it for fun, additional people can join in at any time.

This is another game (such as Apples to Apples, Dixit) that begs for expansions.

Bruno Faidutti likes. 

I need to add wipe off boards for everyone--I think all the scorekeeping is unnecessary.

Also known as Portrayal.  This is a fun game where you describe a drawing to the rest of the group, and they have to attempt to replicate the drawing based on your description.

Not something that you could play all the time, mainly due to the limited number of pictures, which limits replayability.  But it's still such a simple, fun and unique idea that I can't believe no one thought of it before.

Experience with the game pays off, since there are often criteria that pop up more frequently (relative heights, number of buttons), and I'm not sure I like the scoring for the portrayer.  Why wouldn't you deliberately describe a picture with a little less detail?  In my experience, poor portrayers still score just as many, if not more, points than the majority of drawers, because the likelihood is high that at least one person will get most of the different criteria.

The production value is high, with very nice pads for each player.  Unfortunately the timer was DOA, but they're easily grabbed from other games (or use someone's iPhone/iPod.

Identik is a fast and extremely easy to teach party game: in a minute you are able to set up a game and teach the rules. It proclaims to be the drawing game for people who cannot draw and it's true: your drawing skills will be mostly irrelevant. Sadly, my experience is people who don't like drawing are predisposed against it.

For anyone that doesn't know how to play: you get a card with a picture and some requisites. Without reading the requisites, someone secretly looks at the picture and describes it. Everyone else tries to draw it. After the time runs out, the requisites are unveiled and points are scored in accordance.

And why do drawing skills don't care? Because the cards have a lot of details and, with the time limit, you are focused in drawing fast, not in drawing well. In my experience, people who know how to draw don't win during their fist games because they can't get past the fact their drawings look so horrible. They get obsessed with unnecessary small details, with unnecessarily perfect traces, which hinders them.

Identik is a wonderful game for anyone who wants a simple yet clever party game. It doesn't require teams and can scale up to any number of players. Much like what happens in trivia games, the limited number of cards can be an issue if it hits the table very often. Thankfully, you don't draw all that many per session, so it's perfect for occasional play.

Spanish edition note: At least in its first edition, several cards have translation errors. Keep an eye out for them.

I suspect this will be an 8 on my second play, but on one play it takes a few turns to wrap your head around it. The mechanic is fun, the pictures are weird, and it's a hoot to see people's weird drawing styles.

The amount of information you get 90 seconds to convey makes being the art director kind of tense, which I don't expect in a party game.

A very special entry in the party game genre: This one is actually fun to play.

There are only 60 cards, of which the easy side is pretty much useless, so the game gets obsolete very quickly. The copy I played came with a faulty timer.

RATING: 5
Interesting in that no one else has to guess what you drew or judge your drawing in any way (which might make non-artists feel better), but the 10 secret scoring criteria are really just random and you can't take this too seriously as a competition. You might score a point "if the cow you drew has no udder", or you might score for the opposite - there's no way of knowing.

Update: Came across this title again while cleaning my wishlist, reprint has been reviewed and I now see this as complimenting Telestrations when player numbers are small/uneven. 

Don't know how I came across this title, but noted that Scott did a review. You can even play a round with him as he provides a 90 second description of a surreal image. The fun comes from the pressure to draw as quickly and accurately as possible whilst keeping up with the description. Why? Because you score up to 10 points for features listed under the image. The describer will be forced to cram as much info in the 90 secs as s/he scores for each feature that at least 1 artist has drawn. Maybe abit much in the way of scoring but the pressure and the resulting bad representations and scoring may be worth it.

Played this a few times and we've had fun. Very different creative game. The first time my seven year old was up to describe we almost decided to pass him so he wouldn't get too discouraged. He ended up getting all ten points. He gets very frustrated drawing, though, so he's still a little young. You also have to find a balance between not being too picky (are you sure the lines are grass?) and too lenient (okay that smudge can be an elephant?)

RATING: 4
This is a party game that lives on the end of the spectrum much closer to social activity than game.  The biggest problem I have is that the person describing has little incentive to acurately describe his picture at all.  In order for him to get the full 10 points, at least one person has to include each item from the secret list.  Because of the bizarre choices sometimes chosen for this, he has to give a pretty detailed account.  The problem is that with the random bonus item, the drawing players can earn up to 12 points while the describer tops out at 10.  Thus from a gaming standpoint, it is to the describer's advantage to not describe his picture at all.  If everyone does this, there is no game to be had.  

As an activity -- where you play for fun and don't keep track of points from round to round -- this is actually pretty good.  The fact that this involves drawing but does not require you to have any real artistic skill is a real bonus.  So as an activity -- for a few rounds at least -- I would give this a 7.  [03/14/2008]

An entertaining party game when played for a short spell. It's really simple, and the hidden criteria can really surprise a lot of players. This is the first time we spent a minute deliberating on whether a circle with a triangle in it counted as a mouth with a tooth. I'm not particularly fond of the criteria which requires certain objects to be smaller/bigger than another object in the same image though.

One person, unaware of the criteria that will be used to evaluate accuracy, describes an image for the other players to draw.  When the timer rings, the artists swap works and evaluate each others' based on the newly-revealed criteria associated with the image.  Each player gets 1 point for each listed attribute s/he has portrayed and 3 points for the golden criterion (determined by a number roled in advance of the description).  Describer gets one point for each criterion captured by any player -- no bonus for the golden.  Play the same number of rounds as you have players, giving each player one chance to describe.  Player with the highest point total wins.

Great concept badly implemented.  Ugly drawings, finicky/stupid criteria.

A surprisingly fun party game. There's drawing, but you're judged by the content rather than the quality of your pictures so most people should be able to play this.

One person looks at a picture and describes it in detail while everyone else is trying to draw what is being described (90 seconds). Then you pass your drawing to a neighbor and go down a checklist (10 items) of details. The artist earns 1VP for every correct item, with one bonus item (roll d10) worth 3. The describer earns 1VP for each item if any of the artists earned points. Play n rounds ... most points wins.

Entertaining family-game. No necessary to be an expert in drawings, however be an expert in recognizing details!

Very fun party game.  Not as roudy as pictionary or apples to apples since everyone has their nose down drawing, but there is more trash talk :)

Rating this game was very difficult. I had a blast playing it, it is very entertaining. Either I was incredibly impressed with the other player's abilities or I laughed so hard at their lack of abilities that I cried. A great party game because it is easy to understand. It may not be easy to play but unlike some games, poor drawers do stand a chance. I appreciated that aspect as well as the creativity. I think it's a pretty good game overall. The twists (time-limit, that only certain "descriptive elements" count for points which are unknown to the describer) are fantastic, they really enhance and enrich the game. My two biggest complaints are that I am horrible at instructing other players (I perpetually lost at the whole plethora of camp games involving that aspect). I feel frustrated, stressed, and guilty when I cannot accurately describe the picture or make other players lose points. My other complaint is that it was played in my second language which made drawing incredibly frustrating and challenging as I only understood about half of what was being said. Barring that, enjoyable.

Nouvelle variation sur un thème connu.  Après Pictionary et Cranium qui contient un peu de dessin, ca renouvelle le genre. Pas besoin d'être bon en dessin, c'est pratique pour tout le monde.

I usually draw dead bodies until they lock me up and the game ends.

X I never thought I'd love a painting game that much. Great party game for gamers who don't like party games.

An awesome take on the drawing game idea.  I can't draw to save my life though so I find this difficult.  Nonetheless, I like this game where I don't like drawing games generally.

Cool concept, but the scoring takes the tempo out of the game. I would recommend 'Telestrations' over this game.

Hands down, the best 'Pictionary'-style game.  One player describes a pre-drawn picture, and everyone has to draw it.  10 questions determine who did it best.  So fun.

Mal ein anderes Malspiel. Hier kommt es nicht aufs Können an, sondern darauf, ein von einem Mitspieler beschriebenes Bild (das man selber nicht sieht) möglichst genau nachzumalen. Dabei kommt es darauf an, was wo zu sehen ist, und nicht auf die Qualität der Zeichnung. Leider extrem glücksabhängig...

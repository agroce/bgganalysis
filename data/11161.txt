The map is too small and, due to the sewers and three of the adventure cards, too easy to get around.  The quests simply aren't challenging enough.  Hence, Den of the Wererats is over far too quickly to be satisfying.  A shame because the setting is nice and the wererats are fun.

I like this little game a lot! it causes such an imagination to run rampant when playing for me, that it is one of those that gets me in the soft spot every time I deal them up! There was some exploiting of rules and admittedly on our first few times through we did not have the dungeon master aspect down to a tee, but we had some fun once that (and the very one sided whuppings) was overcome! Loot is fun to get and as addictive as in most every dungeon crawler I have played, and while I have not been able to just deal them and sit in front of them for the hours I would like (ALL my plays were at work..hehehe) I do believe that my enjoyment of them will go up. 

I am very happy this is in my collection, and I look forward to completing these early titles and hope to see something more from Atlas and the creator in the future!

Updating the score, there are some plays in here that have not been documented, no indictment on the game, just me. I still really like this title and plan on finishing it out as much as possible as soon as I can, I will play this one and hope to introduce it to more as soon as possible!

RATING: N/A
Played it a couple times standalone.  It's a bit strange working with much fewer cards, but it seems to work much better for two players than the original larger base sets did.

Now that there are bigger Wilderness sets out there, I am pruning down my Dungeoneer collection.

RATING: 4
I tried to like it but it did not work... I love dungeoncrawling and games like Dungeonquest, Heroquest and so on, but this one could not impress me... Maybe it is just because we played it wrong (The rulebook is a MESS!) but many mechanics just felt more complicated than they needed to be and too abstract for the theme of the game (For example: Why is a hero able to explore a new area of the dungeon while standing completely somewhere else? Any many more things like this...

A great idea that doesn't always work. The cards are nicely done. There are a lot of things I really like about this game, but it definitely has some problems.

The real problem is that it is far too complex for a game that is supposed to be simple - there is just too much to keep track of.

I prefer the Tomb and Woods sets over this one.

After many attempts of eeking a good game out of this, I have given up. The game is just too unbalanced and complex for what it is.

RATING: 5
Cool expansion for Dungeoneer, but played in isolation seems a little flat.  The area to explore is very, very small... but might give you a quick Dungeoneer fix if you only have a short amount of time.  More fun as an expansion than a stand-alone.

The rules for this game could be simplified somewhat - here's my suggestion:
Rule 1) Find out who goes first
Rule 2) Whoever goes first, wins the game.

At least this was the case in the couple of games we played...It was always the case that the player who began the game won, and the player who came second would have won if he....well, if he had started....

Dungeoneer - somewhere there might be a good game in it, but it isn't yet quite there somehow...

RATING: 7
See my comments about Tomb of the Lich Lord for my opinion on Dungeoneer as a whole. 

For Den of the Wererats:

This, along with Haunted Woods of Malthorin, is a standalone expansion designed for only two players. It uses one deck of cards instead of two, and surprisingly plays just as well as the "full" sets. I think the monsters in Den of the Wererats are a bit more difficult than those in Haunted Woods of Malthorin, but there really aren't any substantive differences between the two--although Den of the Wererats has a few interesting card effects not found in other sets. 

One thing I do appreciate is how each set has its own feel thanks to the excellent artwork by Thomas Denmark. This really keeps Dungeoneer fresh and interesting after multiple plays. If you get tired of fighting rats in darkened alleys and shady city corners, there are forests, deserts, mountains and a slew of other interesting locales to explore.

Bundled with 'Haunted Woods of Malthorin' in one box (named 'Zemsta Malthorina') in Polish edition. The only logical solution considering very modest quantity of cards.

It's basically the same experience as the first entry of the Dungeoneer series (see my comments on 'Dungeoneer: Tomb of the Lich Lord'), but for some reason this part is less compelling for me (flavour? ideas on cards? not being as familiar with cards as in case of TotLL?...). Hence the rating lower by 0.5.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (January 2017)

Dungeoneer: Den of the Wererats has a great premise, but the game fails to deliver! I think the idea of the game was to translate a RPG experience to the table and in a short time frame and it succeeds in that regard.

The rules of the game are more or less easy to learn, although the rulebook could be a lot clearer. You can teach the game under 15 minutes and play it under 50 minutes.

Dungeoneer has a great theme and the art is pretty good but it has a lot of luck in it, more that I’m comfortable with. The dice don’t bother me as much as the luck inherent in the location/quest cards, as you are building the dungeon, they can appear in any moment and benefit one player over the other one giving him a win that was decided only by luck.

Most decisions are rather easy and obvious. The game is much more thematic than strategic.

Bottom line, my old self would have loved this, but in recent years, I have drifted away from this kind of game. If you like fast RPGs you probably will like the game. It has a lot of uncontrollable luck. I will sell it ASAP along with all the Dungeoneer sets I have.

I can respect Dungeoneer. It packs a surprising amount of questing, leveling, equipping, exploring, and character building in a single tuckbox. The complexity level is fairly high, with all kinds of values and progressions and limits and so on..., but it all fits within the expected "kill monsters, find stuff" framework. 

I think it's an odd fit when played as a two-player game. Perhaps a richer experience with more..., but then you'd probably want a bigger game with more components etc. to set the scene. This style of game, for me, works better as a single-player videogame. For fans of of the Fantasy genre, this is probably pretty solid.

I owned this game and traded it away.

[Core game]The art work of Dungeoneer is gorgeous, the gameplay reads fine but once I started to play there wasn't much I could do to influence where the quest rooms popped up; leading to games where the lucky won, not the best player.

There is a good game in there trying to break out but I'm not going to hang onto this game until the rules are cleaned up enough to show all its brilliance[/core game]

This expansion adds some interesting elements to the game but still suffers from the same basic problem; obscured rules and unbalanced card drawing leading to short games.

We must have played this game a hundred times.  I mean we really played it.  And you know what, it stood up.

Not really worth it as a standalone game. if you have the other packs in the series and you are either already invested or are happy to invest in it - it might be worth it. The characters and gameplay are nice, with an interesting dynamics that each player controls the monsters confronting the other player. There's an interesting interplay between what you do in your turn and what your opponent can do to you, and you have to be managing your own stuff as well as the dungeon your opponent faces. The quest and story are fine - very typical fantasy tropes, nothing too unique, but they are nice. 

At the same time, the game system is SO c_u_m_b_e_r_s_o_m_e. If you want a quick 2p game, this is not it! It takes a really long while to learn, and it has very little re-playability as a standalone set (very few monsters, very few items, very few map tiles). There are a to of little symbols to learn (the circular melee is not the same as the square one) and a bunch of them don't even come into play in this set. So there's a huge barrier to entry, and the set as a standalone game is really not worth it.

I do NOT like this as a stand-alone game.  The map is just too small.  Essentially all of the quests are 2-3 spaces from the entrance, which makes for a shorter game.  There are sewers for special warp-like movement, but they won't save you that many movement points.  That being said, play it with another set and it should be fine.  I have combined it with the Haunted Woods, also a single deck set, and it works pretty well.  Also, it's still got all the things you need for a light-rpg experience.

Dungeoneer is a card-driven "dungeon" delving role playing game where players build the map, complete quests, and accumulate glory and peril as they traverse the map.  Glory is spent by the player to gain items and abilities for their own hero, while peril is spent by their opponents to cause them to overcome traps and face monsters.  Players always know how much peril and glory they have accumulated, thus they can know how much opposition they may face.  Each game is a standalone game but they can be combined.

The "single deck" wilderness sets really are too small. Especially in this case, with a dungeon that is just TINY. That said, I like the artwork of this expansion a great deal with ominous locations and menacing monsters. With regard to the rules on the cards, I can also imagine it is a _very_ good set to combine with other sets. As a system, I think that Dungeoneer is a game that is quite difficult to grasp for nongamers, but if you stick with it it becomes quite rewarding. At the very least, it is a very atmospheric dungeon crawler.
By the way: The unofficial 2.2 version of the rulebook comes highly recommended!

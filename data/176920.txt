RATING: 7
Crazy game, but fun. Played with the boys and we all had a good time. Completely unpredictable and chaotic. There were multiple times were we selected the same number and there were many times when I missed out on playing astronauts into the ships. Will play again and would like to try to bring it to game night.

[I]tl;dr - A nice little blind role selection, area-control game with a few too many warts to stick in our collection.[/I]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

Mission: Red Planet is a role selection and area control game set on the surface of Mars. Throughout the game, you will send astronauts to Mars in rockets, and struggle to control the various regions of the planet. You will accomplish this by playing various roles from your hand, which let you move, attack, explore, and launch rockets. Throughout, you are competing with other players, which makes for a fun, competitive little game. 

This is a pretty lightweight game overall, and can hinge on luck. I strongly dislike that the region values (1,2, and 3 points each) are hidden on the first round. This means that your initial astronaut placings are total luck -- and the first phase is 1/3 of the game! I may try a variant with these showing, as I feel like some players can get hopelessly left behind after only the first round.

Additionally, the game feels a little too short for players to be able to use their Scientists to great effect. A player can drop a very negative mission card underneath a region, but there may not be time for other players to check this card with their scientist, which leads to harsh penalties at end of game. Further, there's not as much ability to move your astronauts around once landed on mars -- that all has to happen in the rockets, which makes it hard to adapt your strategy.

Aside from those quibbles, this is a decent game that doesn't try too hard to be something it's not. I have enjoyed it, but wouldn't say that it's a phenomenal game or that it is one of my favorites. 

I'd recommend it if you mostly play lighter-weight, family-style games as this game slots great into that slot. It plays in about 60 minutes and competition isn't so fierce that feelings get hurt. We ended up getting rid of this one.

This game is essentially Citadels with hidden objectives and area control. That is a a wonderful combination, although this game is not nearly as approachable as Citadels. It's easy enough to learn, but it takes a few rounds to really grasp it. There is a lot of strategy potential and there are just enough elements to keep the game interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Played the first and this edition.  Overall, I like this one better.

Components... 
-the board comes apart into 4 pieces.  Original, it's a 2x2 folding board, but this is still more compact.  Plus, Lost In Space is it's own mini-mat
-Astronauts are nice since they're NOT round.  The wooden discs can roll far if they fall off the table.  Plus, wood generally does add noticeably more cost to a game
-nice touch on the cards that line up with the docking hatch
-the launch pad is also dynamic... "jigsaw puzzle" physically link them up to the # of players playing

GAMEPLAY
-I like having Phobos as a new area
-IIRC Scientist is an improvement, as you get to place astrnoauts AND do stuff with cards

RATING: 7
4 plays / 4,5,6 players

LIKE: Simple mechanisms with role selection, but some depth for crafty plays. Excellent presentation and illustrations. Better with more players, good 5-6 player game.
DISLIKE: Combat, with back-and-forth struggle for control. I don't think it's too bad here, as sometimes it's better to go after opportunities. The "discovery" cards are swingy and can change a good move to a bad move or vice versa.

OVERALL: Light-weight game with attacking. Needs the right group, but the game has some interesting role cards which adds a bit of fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Outguessing your opponents can be either very fun or extremely frustrating. It largely depends on the amount of damage from being outwitted yourself. Mission: Red Planet is on the verge of falling into the category of frustrating barely managing to stay on the fun side. Accepting the truth that you cannot control everything and that the swings in the game can be extremely dramatic incinerating the loser into a pile of fine ash, you can actually see a game behind the wall of apparent chaos and “in your face” / ”take that” moments. By this I mean that you need to have a strategy. And every turn you need to play your position on the board and in the table and choose an action that fits your strategy. In other words the game rewards good tactics as well.
 
My first comparison (although a loose one) was El Grande. Area control is an obvious common nominator for both games, but they also follow the same kind of group dynamics. Everyone hits the leader, which is why you want to fly under the radar most of the game. However, the randomness and chaos of Mission: Red Planet is something not into everyone’s liking, especially if you like being in control. Personally I am fine with it, especially since there is still room for a game plan and interesting decisions. Just keep in mind, that losing badly does not necessarily mean that you’ve played bad, even though playing bad causes you to lose bad.

1st play: The first time I liked a Steampunk themed game.  We played with 3 and the game was pretty one-sided.  I think with more players it will probably open up a bit further.  The game reminds me strongly of Citadels with an Area Control aspect.  The different player powers and their numbers make it a nice risk vs reward scenario, and the turns are quick and there's very little downtime.

2nd play: MUCH better 2nd play, and proof of why the 2 plays rule is so good.  The game is a lot more volatile and fun with 5 than with 3.  A fun area control game with great production value.

RATING: 8
The count down technique helps to keep the pace moving well, while still giving players choices. the main critique of this game is how different the feel of the game goes from strategic to random across the player count.

I love the game, but I have to concede that for the player counts available to me this game just won’t see play. I’ll reward myself however, if I can move this I will buy Concordia.

Some strategy. Some "take that". A bit of luck sprinkled in. This game is simply fun.
Gorgeous art. Solid production. Easy to teach rules.

The unique simultaneous action selection "countdown" twist makes this medium/light area majority game shine.
Lots of opportunities for interesting decision making since timing is everything in this game.

Poor sports to undone plans should avoid Mission Red Planet at all costs, everyone else should try to get this one to the table.
Highly recommended for fans of Jamaica and Raptor.

I really dislike mixing the unused missions in with the Discovery deck, since the reward for completing them is far too high, comparatively.

The second edition to the long revered title, and an excellent addition to any collection. 

My only criticism is that bleeping board. 
- First off, it's just ridiculously small. During a six player game things get insanely crowded, making the game difficult to score. 
- Second, it's a thinner "puzzle piece" style board.

RATING: 8
Its a Citadels with area control implementations. This is a great party game, ideal for groups with experienced and inexperienced players mixed together. Rules are easy and straightforward, flow of the game is fast.

Some notes:
You cant really strategise since things are changing very much through rounds, so its more tactical than strategy game.
Luck factor is high, as it should be, because ,again, this is a party game.. twists are there and they are really hard to predict.
Trying to guess what an opponent will play, its really hard (surely harder than citadels).

It's always exciting when you miss the boat on a popular game and then get the re-release with even more gorgeous artwork and components, and this is one of those cases for me. As for the game play, it's a cute little area control game where you are competing for Ice resource points and rocketing your astronauts up to various regions. I like how you can place the discovery cards face down in different regions to affect scoring, and I also love those Faidutti role cards that you'll count down (akin to Citadels). Lot of neat mechanics in a light to medium weight package. Cathala and Faidutti together? Sold.

1/14/18: The art isn't quite as steampunk as the first edition, but it has the mandatory FFG miniatures.  I can understand the desire for miniatures, but at the same time they are so small that they don't have a lot of character, and they are definitely not as clear to count as wood disks are.

Fun but definitely subject to the vagaries of luck.

I was super excited for this game after watching a few play thrus that referenced citadels as the feeling this game had. And while I think citadels will hit my table more often, with the role selection I can see why people felt this was the next step up from citadels.

Theme: 10/10 FF does good theme, the characters are charming and the art is a steam punk space explorer motif is really well executed.
Rule book: Could use some work, not overly clear on certain items and gives examples for the most logical steps (like how to split resources between a 2 player tie when you have two tokens but not when you have 1 etc).
Gameplay: it is fast mixture of role selection/ability uses, area control resource gathering. It is by far a lighter area control game then most but that is honestly what I really like about it. You won't have trouble getting less experienced people to try this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
There's so much here that ticks the right boxes for me. Engaging theme, I love the role-selection mechanic, the Discovery cards add bluffing, clear rule-book, plays in an hour, family like it. As for the production quality, they've even made the Phobos mini-board a different colour from Mars and an odd shape - all astronomically correct because it is not a moon, it's probably a captured asteroid. The minis are cute and I will get round to painting them. Upped the rating from 7 which I gave the first edition.
Slightly unsure about all the mission cards, some seem much better bets for VPs than others, but need to explore them further.

Pros:

Rocket launching is very clever.

Cons:
I can see the map deteriorating after several plays due to having to disassemble it every time.
Map gets cluttered after a while, hard to see destinatinations.

I really like this game and would have rated it higher if I haven't seen enough people just struggle with the randomness of the game a bit.  To be clear, it is chaotic - especially at higher player counts.  The best way to enjoy it is to put in your plans and see what silliness happens.  It is ultimately quite a silly game that has some more heavy gamer trappings, but the action selection is fun, and it really works if you don't take it too seriously.  If you have the right group, it can be a blast (...off...)!

Fun family weight area control game that takes the character power mechanic from Citadels and runs away with it. Different missions make controlling many different areas of Mars inviting, while points from resource production entice you to focus on heavily controlling only a select few. Character powers and "discovery" cards add a bit of chaos to make the game a tad more unpredictable. Fun, engaging, and well themed.

I played the original edition of this game once, but it was kind of a dud because of how certain cards came up. I think Fantasy Flight did a good job at tweaking the rules just enough to make all my complaints go away. The components are stellar, and the mechanisms are an interesting mix of role-selection and area control. I think I'll be keeping it in my collection because it gives me that Citadels feel with a new layer of strategy. I only have 2 problems with the game. First of all, the rules get a bit extensive when you add in all the special things that are added by the cards. And my one other complaint would be that it gets kind of mean and nasty, so you definitely have to play with the right group so that you won't have sore feelings making the experience worse.

The steampunk mining mars theme in this game is complimented by enjoyable but almost gateway mechanisms. Players all have the same cards numbered 1-9 to play to load astronauts on rockets, move them about mars, and even take out other astronauts or prematurely launch rockets. Once on the planet, players are viieng for control of the different areas to control the resources that are there, which is the main way to gain points. 

While better for 4 or more, this game scales well and works with a diverse group of people. The second edition updates the art a bit and replaces the astronaut discs with little astronaut miniatures. Excellent game that I'd recommend to just about anybody.

Fantastic area control/hand management game that feels simultaneously light and deep at the same time. This is far lighter than other area control games that I enjoy like Dominant Species and Blood Rage, but it scratches a similar itch and it does so in 35-45 minutes. Easy game to teach and it is very accessible to beginner gamers. Sure the end game scoring can be a bit chaotic, but I rather like the scoring mechanisms given that the game is short, cheeky, and incredibly fun.

I really enjoyed this game immensely. It's so much fun and relatively quick to play for my overly-thinky game group.

Area of control and resource collection game. 

What makes this game cool is that to play each player simultaneously picks their action card from 9 cards. Each card can only be played once in the game and the order in which cards are activated are very important, as some they will affect or even disable other actions.

Viva el plástico. Es un juego de mayorías con mucho caos pero a la vez muy divertido. Como se notará de mi colección, los juegos de mayorías me gustan, y este no es una excepción. Unos componentes muy cuidados en una caja llena de aire (podríamos decir que 2/3 de la caja son aire).

MRP is a very tactical that full of excitement. The theme and the artwork are excellent. Really really lovee the game!! It is also a game that both non-gamers and gamers could enjoy. I always have a chill and a tons of fun bringing this game out to the table. Eventhough it’s chaotic and hard to plan ahead its doesn’t bother me much. If you don’t mind a direct/into face kindof game. MRP deserves to be in your collection, it is a must.

I've found another lunchtime game! I picked up this newest edition because I'm always looking for good lunchtime games to fit in an hour. Libertalia is a top favorite of the "lunch crew," and this games struck me as similar in weight with a nice role selection mechanic.

After one play, it's a hit with the team. The added area control element works well with the role selection... it plays fast, there's definitely "take that" and interact... it's a polished design.

I also suspect familiarity with the available nine roles will certainly improve as a group and add a nice layer of tactics down the road.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Happy I got a chance to try this and it honestly surprised me a little bit as to how much I liked it. Play 1 of 9 roles over 10 turns (1 card lets you pick up previously played roles) to send people to certain zones of Mars or to the moon. The roles can also let you move your astronauts around, destroy spaceships, or launch ships before they are full. After certain rounds resources are added to the zones and if can be distributed to the person with the most astronauts in that zone. In addition, there are cards that allow you to manipulate how zones score at the end of the game or go for secret missions. Really enjoyed the puzzle this one provided and while there is definitely some take that it did not bother me as much in other games.

Lots of fun, though I'm not very good. I like the area control and using your hand of cards to take actions. Bruno Cathala and Faidutti uses a similar hand management system in their game Raptor which I also like, except in this case you get your whole hand of 9 cards to choose from until you play the card that retrieves your hand. You can be mindful of what your opponents may be able to do based on what cards they have already played (and therefore can't play). I love the steampunk theme and color astronauts. And the countdown is really fun too.

RATING: 7
Simultaneous selection of hidden roles to obtain VPs  by controlling different areas of Mars. Not dissimilar to Citadels but has more strategy due to the worker placement decisions and some very powerful secrete missions that score if you fulfil their demands ( most astronauts in x; most resources, etc). Once your familiar with the nine different role cards, play is quick and an average game is under an hour. Personally I would love to see an expansion for this game as I can see this game feeling a bit same old after a few plays but that said it was well received in my group on its first outing.

Another instance of the lame BGG decision to split the game entry from the original edition over minor changes.

My comment is very similar to my comments of the original game, which I haven't played again since it came out, what, 8 years ago? Anyway, in a multiplayer game, the "choose whom to screw" mechanic is just too 1980's. But that didn't seem to bother everyone else playing. Oh, and completely unbalanced cards and secret goals mean you don't really know what other players are doing. Which makes it not really a game in my book. Some people apparently are satisfied with getting a laugh.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.6
Clearly the next step beyond Citadels, this time you're carefully selecting your roles, trying to get points in an area majority planet. The biggest changes here are that you only get to pick each role once (unless you use a turn to replenish your hand), and it's definitely nastier from a player interaction standpoint.

I thought it was OK, but felt like just a little too much. Bumping up my rating slightly because the art and presentation is so strong, as one might expect from Fantasy Flight.

Very nice game with some "take that" mechanics that can make you laugh pretty hard. Taking ship in front of someone eyes is just pure evil...or changing it's rout to different location. Evil. Nice components and tons of fun.

love the mechanics at play here - everyone has the same cards and access to the same spaces.  a hidden objective drives some motiviation and the countdown nature of moves is fun.  The bright colors really make this pop off the table. Have sold a few friends on this game after playing it
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A nice game, with an interesting gameplay and fun theme. I like that there is not really much luck involved, but more about second guessing your opponents.

I would rate it higher, but the group I play with (mainly family and a non-gamer friends) do not find it amazing to play, and prefer several of the other games we have. The second-guessing of your opponents is not particularly popular with everyone.

This is a good area control game that has a little take that in it. Although I enjoyed it, I like El Grande better for area control and the card hand is like Concordia, a game I also like more. This should remain in my collection as a lighter area control game. it is easy to teach and plays quickly.

RATING: 7
This is a tightly designed, lean game that has enough fat to it to make it yummy... like bacon. Hm. Weird analogy.

Anyway- the design mechanics are all well integrated and really support the theme. The FF miniature astronauts also support the atmosphere and work well in the game- enough to justify them. The countdown aspect to revealing your agent, and the game board being a round Mars and Phobos moon, along with the launchpad and launching rockets all add up to great additions to support being vested in the game play.

I like this editions art better than the original, so that is a plus for me. And I like the changes to the game- Phobos, for example, is fun, and adds a certain degree of violence which ups the ante.

Gameplay is streamlined with enough direct conflict and indirect conflict for there to be interest in other players' actions. They pushed the design implementation of the game very much toward functionality AND increased design interest at the same time. Quite a feat.

Made blast off noises when rockets launch, pewpew when astronauts died in fights, and splosions when rockets blowed up.

It is clearly heavily inspired by El Grande.

1st edition is cheaper but does not come w/ factory rules for 2 players
Players work as mining companies compete to send astronauts to Mars in order to colonize and mine for recently discovered materials. Over the course of 10 rounds, players play one of their special agents every round to help fill the rockets heading to Mars with their own astronauts while simultaneously working to prevent their opponents from doing the same. Once landed, these astronauts must gather to control specific regions of the planet, each yielding one of the three resources.

Pros: 
- simultaneous role selection gives players the fun task of trying to read multiple opponents' intentions

Pretty chaotic, a fair amount of luck, and plenty of opportunities to screw people over.  But it plays in 30-45 minutes.  Box says 60 minutes, maybe for your first game, but once you know it, it can really play quickly.   It's like Citadels with area majority scoring, although not as harsh as Citadels can be.  This game doesn't seem to have gotten a fair shake.  Very cool artwork and stylizing but the bonus cards could be more clear.   I generally prefer this over Citadels these days.

The FFG version fixes many of the production issues with the original game.   Subtle point:  They printed the map boards and rocket boards upside down, so that it is easy to slide cards underneath them.   The moon (Phobos) is a nice tweak to the original game.

Mission Red Planet is a simultaneous action-selection and area control game with a high amount of player interaction/conflict.  The game is set in a steampunk universe and players are corporations competing to send astronauts to Mars to occupy and harvest its resources.  

Every player has an identical set of 9 character cards, each with unique abilities (moving astronauts, placing them in ships, blowing up ships, redirecting ships, killing off astronauts, etc.)  Players select their character simultaneously and reveal them based on their numerical priority and take that action.  Players try to fill spaceships to send their astronauts to various regions on Mars and maneuver them to gain area majorities to score points.  There are also special actions, secret missions, and regional discoveries that add more elements and variety to the game.  

This game is strategic but be prepared to have your plans messed with.  In addition to finding the best action to suit your needs, you also have to take into account what your opponents might choose and what they have already played.  

This edition is beautifully produced, and the game board and pieces bring the theme to life.  If you are looking for a thematic game with lots of player interaction, but also one where your strategy and choices do make a big difference, I highly recommend this one!

A role selection game with aspects of Citadel in it.  Each player begins with identical sets of character cards, each providing a specific effect on the turn it is played.  Once played, it cannot be used again until after the player opts to reshuffle his/her discards, therefore, hand management is as important as the board play on Mars.

I watch Dice Tower pretty regularly and I've heard Tom Vassel and the other guys praising this game endlessly. I love the theme and it looked nice so I finally caved in and got it. It deffinitely deserves all the price it gets and I am surprised it doesn't get the same amount of love as Carcassonne or Ticket to Ride. It is so accessible! I played 4-player game where none of us played before. Including the rules explanation, it took up 70 min! Perfect time. The rules are (again) very easy to explain - you just play 1 card from your hand and the game always lasts for 10 rounds. But the amount of strategy for such a simple and short game is amazing!

Looking at the game I wasn't terribly interested, then had a ton of fun playing.  Very easy to learn, I like that the cards tell you what they do.  I ended up winning on a tie breaker my first time playing

RATING: 7.1
Nem éreztem egetverő változásokat az eredetihez képest, de biztosan történtek szükséges balanszírozások is. A kinézet sokat fejlődött. A játék lényegi része nem változott, még mindig egy szerepválasztós partijáték, sok sok váratlan fordulattal, és az ezzel járó nevetéssel és/vagy bosszankodással. Komolyan venni nem szabad, és akkor jó lesz. :)

RATING: 5
Still much the same game as the first edition.

Mission: Red Planet is a pretty straight-forward area control game. Players send astronauts to different areas on Mars in differently sized rockets (think Puerto Rico: they launch when they are full). Points are scored for each majority in an area.

Faidutti wouldn't be Faidutti if he didn't add some random mayhem to spice things up, though. In this case the role is taken by character selection á la Citadels (with some mean abilities, although generally quite well-balanced) and event cards which can have positive or negative impact on players' scores. Most of the event cards actually remain unknown to the players until they are revealed in the final scoring round.

Mission: Red Planet plays fairly quickly. My biggest beef is with the event cards which can cause huge swings and hit players out of the blue or wash them ahead of the pack in a very arbitrary way. Still, might be Faidutti's best game indeed.

Very much a smash-up between area majority games and Citadels-like role selection.  Beautiful components.  A great flow to the game.  This game requires a little more fierceness then it leads on! And it's pretty mean already with some nasty "killer" cards that you can't always prepare for lest you lose other advantages in the game.  Overall, I really like the basic mechanics in the game (area majority; role selection) but dislike a number of the card effects and really dislike the scoring system.  The fact it grows exponentially makes this game way too fierce and if players are balancing their scores by the middle of the game, the rest of the game is a pain in the ass for the already-losing players.  Overall, an interesting game and definitely glad it exists, but it's probably best for players who love it and play it a lot. For casual players, this can be a brutal, very unforgiving experience that sucks the very soul out of fun.

RATING: 7.9
An enjoyable area control game with a charming steam punk theme.  Cute little plastic astronauts add to the theme nicely.

Has nine cards which are the turn option choices and each card is slightly different and offers interesting choices.  Goal cards offer different directions for each game play - there are a lot of different cards and since you only see 1 or 2 per game, there's a lot of variability.

Outstanding! Same flavor as Citadels, but with area control added in & more thematic. A far more entertaining and satisfying mix. Good fun, replayable, short, and always delivers a good time & laughter. The 2015 edition blows away the older edition, IMO- I much prefer the round moon (with better artwork), & space-men minis. The ships as cards was iffy at first, but more functional in the end.

Love this game! So much havoc! Each person has the same set of cards and uses them in an attempt to literally seduce, sabotage, redirect, jump, gun down, and explode the enemy! It does seem there are little small stuff here and there that you need to worry about, like I feel discoveries could probably be ignored and the game would still be fun, and the game does sum up really fast towards the end

This game can get kind of mathy at times when you are doing the scoring, which i wouldn't remove from the game, but slows it a little

RATING: 6.5
After two plays I can't decide how I feel about this game.  It's either too light and my decisions don't matter, or I can't quite figure out how to control anything or see a longterm strategy beyond working toward my personal mission objectives.  The one interesting strategy I found was when my brother had the mission to have the most dead astronauts.  We quickly caught on that this was his objective, and stopped killing him.  So each round he kept killing himself or blowing up his own ship.  If he discovered that strategy sooner, he would have won by 2 points.  I'll give it a few more plays, but I might toss this one.

Rating stays basically the same after a second play, this time with three players as opposed to my first play with six. Even with the smaller player count, it's hard to accomplish everything you want to do in the game and the randomness is not really my cup of tea. This is a great game to bring out if you have a slightly larger group and want something easy to teach that will generate some laughter, but it's rarely a game I will suggest playing.

The Faidutti (I'm assuming) touch of zany scoring cards is a turn-off. Actually, I guess most of what struck me about this was Faidutti; I liked the pile of distinctive character cards okay, but didn't like needing to learn all of them in order to do very technical timing stuff about getting the last turn exactly right. But... not horrible!

I'd never heard the first edition of this game, but the theme really sold me on it when I got to try edition 2 shortly after it released. I immediately noticed and appreciated the similarities in card play to Libertalia (sorry, never played Citadels), but the light area control was something fairly new to me at the time and I really enjoyed it. Added the game to my own collection a few months later and it's been a hit with my family (even my wife seemed to enjoy it)!

Regalo de la Cuchipandi 2016

Segun el argumento, la tecnologia steampunk ha avanzado extraordinariamente blablabla enviamos cohetes a marte para recolectar recursos alli. En el juego cada jugador lleva una corporacion minera y el objetivo es producir mas que los demas. 

Este juego combina dos mecanicas de una manera bastante acertada: por un lado, acciones con "roles de personaje" que recuerda bastante a juegos como Ciudadelas (del mismo autor: Bruno Faidutti) o Puerto Rico pero que en el hecho de que las gastas y no puedes recuperarlas hasta que ejecutas una determinada accion en que rehaces tu mazo y que se juegan en el orden numerico que incluyen, recuerda mas al sistema de Runewars. por otro lado, consiste en llevar astronautas a marte y en el tablero se puntua por mayorias, al estilo de juegos como El Grande. 

Todo ello con un aspecto visual muy logrado, una mecanica de juego simple y amena y un desarrollo de los acontecimientos no del todo previsible. 

Quizas un poco sobreproducido para el desarrollo de juego que es, pero los astronautas son muy cuquis :D

despues de una partida: Es un juego tirando a ligero pero en el que hay que empezar fuerte desde el principio para no ir a remolque al final. puntuar con los mejores materiales es clave (por eso te dan una puntuacion extra por el "monopolio del hielo", por la mierda de puntuacion que da). hay que tener muy presente que el juego dura 10 rondas y se acaba.

“And our rockets always blow up.” (Tom Wolfe: The Right Stuff.)
—
Lighthearted area control on Mars, like El Grande with exploding rockets and no king. Silly enough so you really don’t mind if someone (perhaps you!) plays the saboteur card and a shipload of your guys gets blown to bits. I’d love to try this with 5 or 6 players; I suspect this would bring more movement into the board, which can be a bit static.

RATING: 5
The game is very clean in its design, but not elegant.  5 out of 10 is not a bad rating, but it is not a good rating.  As with other Bruno Faidutti games this doesn't have much steak with the sizzle.  It suffers from being about 15-20 minutes too long.  I have less severe critiques of the game than Citadels (another game by same designer) but it has that same element of gotcha!  Someone can be greedy and you really can't predict it, and that can set you back.  If one player is in the lead at a critical juncture and you are the one sets them back to allow yourself to win, you may end up being taken out of contention by that players Pyrrhic victory of revenging you out of first place even if it also hurts themselves.  It is very frustrating for someone to hate on you, especially when it isn't the best play.  Games like that need to take less than 30 minutes, not an hour and a half to have someone retard your goal at the finish line 90 minutes in.

RATING: 7.5
My big letdown for 2015. Parts of the game really show its age (the potential to completely lose out on a turn). My group ends up preferring Nefarious for the same sort of simultaneous role selection gameplay. I wouldn't say M:RP is entirely random, but many parts of it feel out of a player's control. All the mechanics revolving around the Scientist are not new-player friendly, despite the rest of the game being a breeze to understand. That fact that they only come up with 1/9 of the cards, yet can have a massive impact can be very frustrating. I still like the game because of the theme and ease of play. 

+Great production quality
+Plays 6 at a decent pace
-Difficult to have any control

Cathala and Faiduti team up to make this little gem. A variation on character change mechanic. Tu misión es "colonizar" Marte, o sea explotar sus recursos. En cada turno tú debes escoger entre 9 personajes, el que escojas no se volverá a usar a menos que uses el recluta para traer a los que has usado, pero como solo hay 9 rounds usar el recluta te limita la opción de usar 1 o más de los personajes. Cada personaje añade un beneficio o una habilidad a tu estrategia. Muy divertido!

In Mission Red Planet, players are competing to earn points by occupying regions on Mars with astronauts. Whichever player holds a majority in each region when it scores is awarded points. That happens three times in the game. during nine rounds of play, players secretly choose one of nine roles which allows loading astronauts into rockets and some special ability, some of which afford nasty 'take that' abilities. I played with 5 players with the new second edition. The game feels chaotic to me and I didn't enjoy the surprise discovery card effects as they are revealed before the final pivotal scoring, often denying players points they worked hard to earn. I will play it again, but I was expecting much more after all the love heaped on Mission Red Planet by the Dice Tower crew for several years now.

Mission:Planète Rouge has a great theme, excellent artwork and some cool components, which are of much better quality in this second edition. The scoring is perhaps too luck-based given the relative importance of the bonus and discovery cards. This is a fun game of moderate length for up to 6 players and, as such, deserves a place in any board game club.

I wasn't really sure what to expect with this game, but I know what I didn't expect was a take-that card game. There is some strategy to be had though. Everyone has the same hand of cards so you know what people are capable of, and the card you play determines both what you do for the turn and in what order you do it, so there's a nice balance there of figuring out when you need to go early vs getting a stronger effect. It was also pretty quick. Not really my kind of game but it was ok.

Always wanted this and now glad I never found a copy as the new edition is stunning. A really great game with simple mechanics but interesting decisions every turn, just the way I like 'em!

Initial Rating: 3.0 (January 2016)

Right from the game explanation, I could see Mission: Red Planet wasn’t a game for me. In short, I hated the game.

The rules are pretty easy to grasp and the game components are fantastic. The art is ok. That’s all the positives Mission: Red Planet has for me.

The game is, relatively, simple but the playtime is way too long for such a simple game. It features the hated (by me) “attack the current leader” balancing mechanism, but the worst offender to me are the uncontrollable luck of the cards. Each player begins with a mission but by playing the scientist some players can acquire another mission (a very big advantage) while other players can acquire less valuable (mostly useless) discovery cards. There is also a lot of luck with the destination cards but it bothers me a bit less than the goal cards. This kind of luck is too much for me. The game is also very chaotic with little room to plan as every moment the game situation can change. If you get screwed, recovering may be impossible. Many decisions seem obvious and/or arbitrary.
 
In general, I dislike Faidutti´s games and this one isn’t the exception. I didn’t have any fun playing it.

Bottom line. Mission: Red Planet has lots of elements I dislike (I hate the game) so I won’t ever play it again. I already sold my copy of the game. I could play it again IF the playtime was short, but it is very long for such a simple game. Luck of the draw is overpowering. Only one other geek in my game group didn’t like it, so perhaps I’m hypersensitive to this kind of game. I was expecting a much better game.

Fun strategic game, plays quickly but not too short, good depth of decision making without a lot of fiddly rules - easy to teach. Great theme, great art, and just a lot of fun to play! The role selection aspect reminded me of Citadels and Templar (espeically the character that lets you pick up all of your used characters).

Some Cons:
Some of the discovery cards seemed quite powerful and could really throw a wrench into the entire strategy of another player. For example one if the cards completely turns off the scoring of a region and another gives all points for a give region to the player in second place despite how many figures the first place player has.

The "take that" element of the game is a bit much for players who do not like confrontational games. Three of the roles - the femme fatal (replace opponents figure with one of yours), the soldier (destroy an opponeit's figure), and the saboteur (blow up a spaceship) involve an attack move on another player.

3-6 players. Light-weight control with simultaneous play through the use of character action cards, which are played simultaneously face-down and are resolved in order from "weakest" to "most powerful" making a unique risk reward system.

Nice update on the original, which improves it in a few ways: graphics, pieces (the minis are way better than the coloured aspirin tablets on the first edition) and gameplay. 

The Phobos moon is a good addition, but the treatment of the special cards for me is the biggest step up over the original. I liked the role-selection based gameplay, but the first edition cards were way too swingy - get dealt 3 discovery cards at game start in the first edition and you way as well go home.

Really enjoyable game - I love the art work, the little astronaut meeples and the other components. The role selection is a bit of a mind game and the area control/secret missions also add interesting choices and variability.

Really great area control game. Really love the production quality on this one, and dig the steampunk theme. There's something really satisfying about moving your little space dudes to the rockets, then blasting them off and moving them around the map. This one was a hit with the rest of the group as well, and we decided this one definitely needs to hit the table again soon.

Really liked both plays of this. One was with four players they second was five. I think the higher player counts are better for this game.   This is best for a group that is familiar with gaming, as it was a little harder for the family setting to grasp the concept.

2017-08-30 - This is a pretty good role selection/area control game. If you're eyeballing Libertalia or Citadels, it might be worth looking into this one instead. Especially, if the theme and area control aspect are appealing to you. I don't know yet if I prefer this to Libertalia, but I definitely like it more than classic Citadels.

A great concept and theme, but the various random elements make for a chaotic, unpredictable experience (especially the cards at the end that change the value of territories). These dynamics nullify any real sense of strategy or advanced planning. This is disappointing because there is so much potential here. I really want to like it, but it just isn't for me.

I love this strategy game although you can't be too sure about your plans. It happens too often that somebody blows up your rocket or sends it to Phobos ;) I usually don't like strategy games that are too interactive / destructive but this is quite fun in terms of entertaining and can also be played with up to 6 players. Nothing for too emotional players though.

Absolutely beeeeautiful components finally do this game justice.  This is unquestionable the version of the game to own, the second edition.  Everything works here, from the little astronauts, to the puzzle construction of Mars, to the gorgeous art...the gameplay is a mix of role selection and area control and timing around when to play certain cards is crucial.  Some may not like the idea of there being "limited turns" in the game.  I like that because it keeps things concise and forces you to be efficient.

Awesome game.

This game is quite high in variance and the difference between the first and last place is huge which disheartens a lot of players. The discoveries can really screw you over and if you try to find out what they are then you basically kinda wasted an action and there is only 10 turns already. Basically the idea is solid but I didn't like the execution.

2017-03-12 - 7 - Suprisingly fast area control game. I like the artwork of the new edition and especially the miniatures. There is quite a lot of ways to mess with other players and to distribute your men. The mechanism of launching rockets to the different areas is quite original way to deploy figures in area control game to me. It has potential, we'll see.

2017-04-02 - 8 - Better with four than three! The first game surprised us by its quick end - now we use our cards more efficiently. I like that there is several ways to obatin points other than controlling the areas.

I really enjoy playing this game! The design, concept, and gameplay are just simply astounding! Your goal is get the most points and this is achieved by settling different parts of Mars. It's a family friendly PVP quick party game. We played with 2 players but arrived at the decision that this is best played with 3-5 players so that you only have your astronaut color to worry about. A great buy and filled with laughs and good times!

You get to colonize Mars! Or rather try to rush as many of your populace to Mars in search of valuable resources.  How you do that you ask? With one of your 9 options/cards each round. Blow up someone elses ship, sneak some extra people on board, change the ships trajectory, all possible in this game of light-medium strategy.  Easy to teach and learn for new players, also pretty fun.  The game plays each round identical, and by that I mean the player in last place still can do everything they could if they were in first so newer players or those losing currently can still have fun in decision making.  Setup and learning 15-20 min, gameplay about an hour and a half, maybe less.  Good for casual or moderate game night.

Really enjoy the artwork and streamlined gameplay that this game offers. The only differences that I see are that this one has GREAT components and the order cards count down, rather than up (which I think makes better sense thematically) and, instead of there being 10 spaces on Mars, the extra space is on Phobos. The only thing that I like more in 1st ed is that the space tokens have the value on the face, rather than just a picture.

RATING: 5
For a game that was at one point on my wishlist this game, while not bad, definitely disappointed. While there are some clever card interactions, each discovery card has a much different strength depending on which part of the game it is in, the constantly changing ships makes the game pretty tactical and you can't even be sure exactly how you're being tactical early in the game because of the face down tokens, and the combination of general chaos without the theme being coming out strong made this one not stand out for me. Compared to Citadels outguessing your opponent doesn't necessarily have a big of an impact because you never know what is going to happen between the turn of the person you are going to take advantage of and yours.

Edit: just watched the Game Boy Geek review and I agree with him that while there aren't really any games that combine area control and simultaneous action selection, there are games that do both mechanics better, making this game feel outclassed in most regards.

This a majority control/area control game.  You load up your astronauts onto spaceships the launch when they are full.  You do this by playing cards of various strength and the highest strength goes first; however, the lower strength cards appear to be better.  

This game was ok.  It may go up in my ranking but it can be a bit random.  You can mitigate the luck factor a bit but there can be a fair amount of randomness in the game.  I would much rather play Alien Frontiers.  I recognize that Alien Frontiers is more serious and this is lighter, family oriented, but even then, I thought the game was not that interesting.

The theme is cool but irrelevant, the artwork is amazing and like many fantasy flight games, the pieces are great. Only complaint is not enough bags to hold every little bit and no solid compartment to hold such pieces. Overall, I love this game and I highly recommend it to all if you like steampunk, Mars invading, backstabbing fun.

An area control game where each player takes rockets to different zones on mars. Most people in a zone controls it, and gets the VPs. The unique aspect is you each get 9 cards and the one you play is your action. So there is a large hand management aspect. The game is easy to learn/teach, and I find it fun.

The new edition's art is perfectly good, but I still love the older one more. The changes to the game iron out some clarification issues, but there are some odd choices - why is the 1-point ice represented by three chunks, when the 3-point Celerium is represented by one block? The biggest improvement comes in the bonus/discovery cards, though the latter still aren't an enormous part of the game.

An excellent example of a 'dudes on a map' game that utilises a really elegant card mechanic (much like Citadels) that times when you will play your turn. The fact that each card can only be used once before resetting keeps it moving at a nice pace and helps avoid AP.

Tried this game tonight with two players.  I really wanted to like this game.  I had high expectations because the game is stunningly beautiful in its artwork and layout.  But, I was underwhelmed.  In fact, I was disappointed.  There was rare player interaction, and not really enough to do with only two card draws if a Scientist popped up.  Upon looking at the suggested '2-player variant' in the rule book, interest waned.  The '2-player variant' simply meant that each player played his primary color and another 'neutral color'...that is, a ghost player.  

The rule book is written in an overly complicated style when it describes simple things to do.  For instance, the 'neutral player' deck mechanism is written as taking four specific cards out of the deck, then two random cards and shuffling them, then take the remaining cards and place them on top of the shuffled deck without looking at them.  All the author had to say was "shuffle the neutral player deck".

I'd like to give this game a try with four or more actual players and see if it is more fun.

First play was a blast! Even my wife who isn't really into games had a lot of fun. This is going to be a keeper. Some players have been frustrated by the chaos of the game, especially the discovery cards at the end. I feel like you just have to embrace the chaos if you're going to enjoy it. It's fantastic when you do.

Edit: the final round can get a little bit mathy, but the uncertainty of the discovery cards helps to minimize this.

Fun area control with an interesting hand management mechanic. My only gripe is players tend to play the same cards rather frequently, but this could fall away as the strategy becomes clearer with more plays.

Based on two plays: I really like this. A very pleasant role selection meets area control game, simple, intuitive, a great mix of genuine decision making and a hint of chaos, not too serious. All in all, beautifully produced, light-hearted and accessible entertainment, some chaos, but also lots of clever prediction and second guessing. Deserves a place in any collection.

A whole lot to like about this game. Easy to teach, plays a wide range, great art, light/medium weight but the thought and strategy required is apparent to a new player right away. The theme is reasonably felt through the game, more so than with a lot of other games of this weight. If you are in the mood to play a "real game" and find yourself in a crowd of non gamers this one is perfect. In a crowd of gamer friends this would still be highly appreciated.

I like the card selection mechanism, and the choices here are good.  However, on my first (and thus far, only) play, I found it a bit random, not from the card selection, but from the "mission" cards you (and others) can get.  I think that if I could play this several more times such that I could remember the cards that existed, my rating would increase.

I like Simultaneous Role selection (like Libertalia). The gameplay is simple and fast... it's a bit chaotic too with all the special powers and abilities but with the rounds passing it becomes easier to try to predict what the other players want to do and what cards they might play. 
So, there are good decision to be made in this one!

The component quality is excellent, the astronaut meeples are just great and add flavor to the game.
The ship cards and launch pads are just awesome in the way they seamlessly blend when the ships are in the launch pad! Great design.

It's a very fun fast playing game! :)

Wow, this game plays beautifully! The best thing is it is complex enough to be a very interesting strategic medium sized dish while being simple enough for new gamers to join in and have a solid chance of doing well (oh that evil deck of event cards).

Sort of feels like a cross between Libertalia and Alien Frontiers. Being that those are both good games in my book, Mission: Red Planet succeeds for me as well. I do have some minor complaints, however. I think spots on the planet can get overpopulated, and I wish that more Discovery and Action cards came out during each game, but for the most part, this game works. Just not sure if it has much replay value in the long run.

Very enjoyable role selection, area control, take that style game. The art style and production quality are top notch, as with all Fantasy Flight games. The fun of trying to get your astronaut onto Mars is always a little tense at times, and then once your on Mars you have to worry about keeping locations. I like the discovery cards, as they add some mystery to scoring, as well as mission cards, which give you some purpose, besides just highest point regions. I even like the most ice gets 9 points, as it helps keep characters fighting for the lowest point resource.

Overall very fun game!

A visual feast, with very effective rocket and area control visuals.  The theme works its magic, and although I haven't made complete sense of the role cards, they seem effective in the game.  Secret missions and a fully populated Mars (and Phobos) by game's end certainly encourage the experienced player, although there's just enough "take that" to throw a little uncertainty into the mix.

Absolutely love this game.  Have only played once so far but I love everything about it and know that each play is going to get better as we learn the possible moves and strategies and draw more of the event cards which can definitely dramatically change the outcome. It is just too much fun putting astronauts on the rockets and having them launch and figure out just how to best make a play but have your play happen before too much stuff changes.  So good.  Get it.

A hidden role games like Citadels or Masquerade, but with more of a purpose. You're trying to colonize Mars with astronauts that are competing over limited ships.

El mito de "El Grande Trash" no me había preparado para la cantidad de trash que contiene el combo. Es verdad que tiene una mecánica de puntuación por mayorías en cada área, pero son juegos completamente distintos. En Red Planet hay infinidad de formas en las que ganar y perder puntos, la mayoría de las cuales no dependen de lo que vayas a hacer el propio jugador durante la partida. Hay suficientes efectos destructivos y distorsivos, y suficiente información oculta, y suficiente variabilidad del escenario que básicamente hacés lo que puedas con lo que te salga y rezás para que tenga sentido. :D

De todos modos, en su defensa el juego tiene todas las virtudes de un trash bien hecho. La confrontación es astuta, el cromo es encantador, los roles le dan personalidad, las piezas son funcionales, el paso (ejem... en general) es fluido, las reglas no son complicadas, la duración es acotada y la narrativa de la partida memorable.

Nuevamente, es trash. Así que saben dónde se meten. Pero es un buen exponente de la evolución del trash que ha sabido adoptar nuevas técnicas para potenciar las virtudes de su género y alivianar la carga para quienes temen incursionar en él.

Muy recomendable

RATING: 7.8
Besides Flick em up and Sylvion, easily the best looking game in my collection. I am always in for this one.

The only problems I have: 

The new players are oblidged to read all nine cards of their deck before they play and this is always boring for them.

Even after a few plays it feels hard to develop a certain strategy and follow it.Many players will get the feeling that they are making completely random actions.

I personnaly like the semi-chaotic situations of the game!!!

(Wife's Point of View: No complaints but also no enthusiasm)

RATING: 7
Mission: Red Planet (second edition) is a very small refinement on the original game.  This is a role-selection area-control game.  Each turn, players select a role from their set hand of nine roles, which allow them to load pawns on ships as well as do some sort of special action.  The roles are performed in numerical order, Citadels-style.  When the ships reach their capacity, they launch and arrive on a pre-determined region on Mars.  In three scoring rounds, regions on Mars generate increasing numbers of point chits of different values depending on the region, which are earned by whoever has the most pawns in that region.  Like many area control games, there are a few ways to mess with your opponent's pawns once they reach the board.  The main addition of this edition is a region representing Phobos.  Phobos acts as a normal region, except movement to and from Phobos usually can't happen, and many of the event cards don't affect it.  Overall, the game is a nice take on the area control genre, but it doesn't really stand out.

I had wanted to play this since I picked it up in a math trade. It has been getting attention from the new printing. I have the 1st edi but I think in general it plays the same. I played the new one and the bits are amazing! I have to say we played with 6p and it just didn't grab me. I thought the Simultaneous action selection would save it but all in all too much area control and take that for me to really appreciate. Everything seemed to go perfectly for some others and everything went horribly wrong for me. I just didn't have a great time. I would try it again, but my copy is on the trade list.

The best part of this game: launching a rocket prematurely and preventing a player from using the Travel Agent.
The worst part of the game:  Not getting a turn when you play the travel agent because some asshole launched a 5 passenger empty rocket.

Not my first choice of game to play but will not turn down a game.  
The game runs true to advertised at 90 minutes or less for 6 players - that's a big +

RATING: 6
This was a nice improvement over 1st edition. Better components, a new place to send people. The card luck was a little rough in terms of what objective cards people happened to draw, since drawing cards isn't such a common occurrence. Sometimes someone would get a card worth only a few points, or sometimes it would be worth nothing and just have a board effect, or sometimes it could be worth a lot of points. The main mechanism of the simultaneous action selection is well done, and very fun, especially in comparison to how poorly tiebreakers on the same card are handled in similar games like Libertalia. I do wish that when area majorities were calculated that there would be some reward for second place. For how difficult it is to get meeples into regions in force, you wind up with people reinforcing areas they already have more than trying to horn into new regions under the control of a single player with 4+ guys.

Fun game with several different types of mechanics rolled together into a coherent whole. I like the simultaneous choosing of the roles, and the ship loading and area control pieces add enough strategy that there's always something interesting to think about. Luck can play a fairly large role, but predicting your opponents' moves is more important. Overall, it's a nice package but I feel like for such a chaotic game it takes a bit too long to play out .

I hate programing games. I hate games that you all pick something and then by the time it gets to you your action could be totally screwed because of what everyone else did or didnt do. There isnt enough strategy here for me. Its hard to plan for anything really and when it comes down to it the game just wasnt any fun. A little too much chaos for my taste. I dont mind chaos in short filler games that dont require much of your time.

Medium to medium-light weight worker placement and area control game. Pretty thematic for the most part and the role selection mixed with the countdown determining priority is well done.

Mission: Red Planet não tem hype nenhum, mas é um jogaço. Imagine um jogo de El Grande passado em Marte, em que a forma de manipular os seus caballeros / astronautas viesse através de cartas estilo Citadels, e não de cartas no tabuleiro. Parece que não vai funcionar mas fica sensacional. As cartas tornam o jogo muito mais temático que El Grande, pois assim como no Citadels, as ações tem a ver com os personagens. Mais uma excelente partida, com as cartas proporcionando a dose certa de fodelança com estratégia de curto e longo prazo. Me arrisco a dar nota 10 pra ele. Queria jogar mais vezes.

Fun chaos. Lighter game that feels meaty and has plenty of interaction. Can be chaotic but still has a lot to think through, as long as you can enjoy watching your plan blow up in your face.

This fits a lot of groups. Not too heavy, so it can work with non-gamers who enjoy conflict. It can also work at the end of the night after playing a crunchier game and we want something less serious. The fact that it plays up to six players in about an hour is icing on the cake.

I'll never feel anything again.

I thought my bouts of serious existential depression had passed, my therapist even suggested dropping my medication.

Then I encountered this game. Any hope or belief I had in the world around me crumbled away as I turned cards over and moved little plastic nightmare people around a board that is apparently Mars.

I hope this review serves as a warning to people so they can avoid the same cold and empty existence I now live. My wife left me, the kids hate me. Even my pet rat Scruffles fled when I accidentally left his cage open.

Why? Why do bad things have to happen?

I like this, but I'm not entirely sure if I like it more than Citadels, which is pretty similar.  The area-control part of the game (placing and moving people on Mars and Phobos) feels a little bit awkward to me.  Overall the game seems pretty solid, though.

I've been pumped about this game for years. I FINALLY got to play it and I must say I was a tad underwhelmed. I think I just don't really get into games that have simultaneous hidden card selection, like this or Citadels or Libertalia or Broom Service. I don't know why. It sounded like a super fun game, but more often than not I found myself frustrated at being screwed over by someone playing a card that just messed with my plans accidentally. I thought it was well designed, just not for me.

Area majority is my favourite mechanics, and this is a good specimen of that genre. A fair bit of luck involved, but not too much. (I'm glad Cathala was there to neutralize some of the Faidutti craziness!) A good game for me to play with the theme junkies.

A note on visual design for Fantasy Flight: for the last time, folks - dolls do not make a game better! And in this particular case they make it much worse. The sheer number of times I had to shake around the stuff in a crowded area to count, just infuriates me.

The chaos in this game drove me nuts.  If you're not incredibly careful with your card choice your turn is ruined thanks to the other players' card choices. You have no idea what action cards players may have, and any discovery cards placed on the boards change the end game in drastic ways, with little recourse. I'm very glad I didn't spend money on this game.

3 players, 2 p variant has each controlling a dummy char.  liked the straight 2p game better - possibly adding dummy astronauts to the board (2 of them) aech turn by randomly drawing a token.  Also, mission cards might be too overpowered, moreso at 2p.  Can maybe just give everyone 3 of them at start or only 3 max.

Varied, fast-paced, interesting decisions. I like how you can make plans and see them come together but also there's enough back-stabbing and randomness that you have to think tactically and adjust for disaster as you go. The little space explorer plastic pieces are absolutely amazing.

This is a great game for what it is: A light, somewhat chaotic, fun fest. There is some skill in managing your deck of personalities but only some and a lot of your planning can be short-circuited by the accidental actions of the other players. Of course, if you get into the fun of the game and aren't too tied up in winning, you won't mind this in the least. I didn't!

I'm giving the game a 7 because while I like it quite a bit, it only works for the rights folks. (That it plays up to 6 is a nice bonus for those larger groups.)

This is a solid SAS (simultaneous action selection) game, and still stands the test of time. The steampunk theme is nicely done, and the hidden objectives combined with outwitting your opponents makes for a solid game. As compared to the first edition, this was really well done. I like the little astronauts, although they might be a bit harder to count, and the spaceships as cards actually function more elegantly. Most importantly, they actually provided enough scoring chits!!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I can't find any specific fault with this game, except that the finest strategy may not win due to an element of luck and fortune. I tend to like role selection games but this one just doesn't add up to me. It's perfectly ok, just not one I'm eager to play much.

RATING: 9.4
Components - .9/1 Little astronauts are nice. The cardboard is great. The box, although has a fair amount of air has an insert that fits everything pretty well, and the size allows for better shelf storage. The cardboard in game is thick and solid. The cards are appropriate. The only knock is that the rules don't explain event cards in the best manner, and a few of the rules seem to be hidden is blocks of text. Minor quibbles, but enough to knock a little off.

Fun - 1/1 Seriously this is probably my favorite game at the time of this writing. When you play a game and immediately upon finishing all 6 people want to play again (after playing 2 games the night before), you know this is a winner. There's enough depth that you can go with several different strategies, but it generally isn't a brain burner so you're not worn out after. Generally we find the turn limit allows you to get enough for a strategy but ends the game at the perfect moment because you feel like just 2 more turns and your master strategy would have been complete. It knows how to not overstay its welcome and that makes you always craving a little more. In addition even when you're clearly not in the lead it feels like you have a chance to get back in. The simultaneous card selection minimizes any sort of AP lag.

Replayability - 1/1 There's secret missions (everyone chooses 1 of 2 dealt to them), there's randomized resources, and there's a deck of ships that get randomized. Let alone the event card deck can change the modifiers. A bulk of the game is managing your plays versus the available spaceships and what other people have already played. With the same group, if no one changes their strategy, it could possibly get samey, but all it would take is someone to stir the pot and the whole game changes. Generally the random secret cards (missions & discovery cards) means you want to be playing the other players more than trying to execute some pre-game strategy.

Strategic - .8/1 I would say that this game seems to scale pretty well. With 6 players it can get chaotic, but rarely does it feel unfair. Generally playing attention to what has been played allows for meaningful tactical decisions, which are then weighed against your grand strategy. You will not have enough time to do everything you want so it's a balancing act. Not knowing everything can mean you get an unfortunate stroke of luck (e.g the zone you needed to get a bunch of resources from is struck barren from a discovery card), but almost all of the secret information can be determined, at the cost of actions. This means you have to balance whether you want to know everything but will have almost no time to execute anything based on that knowledge. 

Thematic - .7/1 Probably the weakest part of the game, but certainly not terrible. The game does make you feel like you're trying to out maneuver your business competition to exploit Mars, but it does have sort of a zaney feel that is reflected in some of the artwork/rules. It's definitely better than meh, but it's not going to compete with the big boys of the thematic game world.


Personal Opinion - 5/5 This game is so much fun. There's that constant feeling that you're running out of time and that overall the game feels like it will never overstay its welcome. Rather you always feel like you were a turn or two extra away from blowing away the competition/jumping right back into the thick of things/etc. I think this game gets it right, no one feels too far out of the race and the game lasts long enough to  get a strategy together, but not too long that those getting beat fall too far behind. It's a pretty quick teach, and although there's depth in the game, it's mostly about playing the people with you and the events of the game so new players can fit right in quickly.

RATING: 8
I have never played the first edition of Mission: Red Planet so these comments are on the independent virtue of the second edition with no comparison to the first.  What I can compare this game to, though, is Citadels.  They have very similar mechanics, I like Citadels and this game adds so much more to it and even solves one of the biggest problems I had with Citadels.

In this game each player is trying to colonize pieces of Mars.  By having area majority during the 3 scoring rounds players receive different resources that are worth 1-3 points each at game end.  Players can also score points by accomplishing hidden missions.  The way players achieve any of this is by role selection.  Each player has a hand of cards numbered from 1-9.  They each choose one at the start of a round and they resolve in descending numerical order.  A big part of this game is predicting your opponents actions, since order matters quite a bit.  There is a lot of "take that" in this game as some characters kill astronauts or even blow up ships killing everyone on board.  So if your opponent chooses the saboteur role you want to make sure your astronauts have already safely launched from the dock.

Probably the biggest difference between the two games is that Citadels uses one pool of cards and each player drafts from it each round, so multiple players never play the same role.  This one difference alone makes them different enough games that I don't think this replaces Citadels.  The other stuff this game does makes it even better though.  Instead of the game being all about the roles and building 8 city districts worth points to win the game, instead there is a whole other area control element attached to this game.  This provides a lot more meaningful player interaction besides just stealing from or assassinating another player and then going back into your own private sandbox to play on your own.

I also mentioned that it resolves one of my biggest issues with Citadels, that issue is game length.  This game has a set number of turns (Citadels ends when someone reaches 8 city districts) and each turn goes by at a pretty good clip.

One of the criticisms levied on this game the last time I played was that it was too chaotic.  With all due respect to that individual I think there is very little chaos in this game.  There is a lot going on and your personal plans can get thrown for a huge loop but you have quite a bit of control over your own destiny.  I think this game is all about deducing what your opponents are going to play.  I think the chaos he saw was a result of making 2 or 3 big mistakes in a row where his turn got crippled by other players going ahead of him and ruining his options.  And granted, it was our first game and he was learning the rules and the strategy, but recognizing what your opponents are most likely to play and understanding that there are safe and risky options with your role selection is a huge part of this game and I love that.

In Mission Red Planet, players are mining mars for valuable materials/metals/minerals/whatever. The player with the most points from their mining operations, is the winner. The main mechanism of the game is simultaneous action selection, as each player starts with the same selection of cards/characters with different powers/actions. 

Each turn of the game, players will pick one character-card to play, trying to outmaneuver one another. AS the game goes by, players will send their crew to Mars at the same time as doing different actions that might power up one's own strategies or messing up the ones opponents plans.

Mission Red Planet is an easy to teach and learn game that can be played in 60 - 90 minutes. Thus, playing it is well worth the time investment required.

[From 1st ed.] Interesting mix of secret role selection and area majority. Can play differently every time. Spite and chaos are decidedly in the mix. Main drawback for many are the Discovery Cards that can totally change the end-game scoring to mere randomness, rather than rewarding carefully laid strategy.

Second ed. adds wonderful astronaut meeples, the moon Phobos, a few event cards, components for 6th player and rules for 2p game. The 2p game is lackluster, but works in a pinch if needed. Phobos is nice addition. Event cards are totally random and may not even pop-up.

While I enjoy this one, I generally would prefer to play something else. It usually only comes out when we need a five or six player game that isn't going to take a long time to play. Haven't even tried it at lower player counts.

The role-selection makes for interesting choices and a little bit of will-he-or-won't-he brain think. Lots of room for someone to either intentionally or accidentally screw up your plans. Not for the risk or conflict adverse.

I know it is considered to be best with 5 players, but it almost seems a little too chaotic. I haven't played with 4 players yet but I suspect I'll like it a little better that way.

Update: Just too chaotic for me. Sometimes when I play I feel like I'm making good moves and I'm in charge, but sometimes it just feels like no matter what you do you get shut out.

Area control, you need more players for more competition.

Very fun area control game with fast play and pretty easy to teach too. I do enjoy the clever card play/sequencing as you try to maximise your turn to find the most optimal play and also the tug of war with controlling areas. A great game with great components and theme.

Love the steampunk artwork. This is one of the most fun I’ve ever had playing the initial game, but after playing it a couple times, I don’t really want to play much again.

RATING: 7.75
The simultaneous action selection component of the game is great. It can lead to a lot of bluffing and trying to play your opponent, plus offers a chance to push your luck.

The area control is also very strong, and the ability to seed area with buffs or debuffs that don't appear until endgame is neat.

I fear that some of the endgame abilities, such as being able to move your units after all other aspects of the game complete, may be a bit overpowered.

The "play a single card from your 1-9 numbered card" mechanic from another Bruno Bros game (Raptor) pops up here as well. It works great, and the "countdown to liftoff" each turn is cute.

Strong area control, a bit of "take that!", and some hidden information. I'd like to play again, for sure.

RATING: 8
So much game in so little time. Very elegant design with basically no down-time at all and plays very well with 3-6 (2-player variant is bad). There is surprisingly big amount of "take that" so if you don't like conflict this is not a game for you. Definitely takes the original game and makes it better in every way (I even prefer the art over original). Some flaws are that Phobos is maybe even too important and in higher player counts you must be able to handle chaos to enjoy the game.

I definitely think this is the superior game to El Grande. Jockeying to move pieces onto the board is more intuitive and has a delightful slapstick comedy to it, and everyone having the same hand of cards helps to facilitate more long-term strategic thinking.

1st impression: Good fun. Plays fast and doesn't overstay its welcome (in fact, could possibly be over a turn or two too soon?). Theme is really strong and informs the strategic gameplay nicely. Quite random - cards don't seem particularly balanced and it seems like a well-played strategy can be undone by a series of unfortunate events.

I've yet to try this one out.

I found this game in a mint condition for 20  € from a thrift store and fell in love with the art and the mini astronauts with tiny little mini flags. Such wow!

7.6 BGG rating and a few people congratulating the game for it's solo play qualities finished the deal.

EDIT (18.9.17):

We finally went through the two-player rules and gave this game a go. And yes, I  liked it. It was way more nasty than I had anticipated but overall we enjoyed the mechanics, theme and art a lot.

EDIT (19.9.17):

We played it again and liked it even more than in the first time. I'll have to test this game with a larger player count.

May be an odd comparison, but there's something that reminds me of Inis here. Mission: Red Planet is more chaotic and simpler, but it's scratches a similar itch for me.

+ The tension of whether a shuttle will still be around by the time your card activates.
+ The dwindling options until you decide to take an action to reload your hand.
+ The ability to blow up ships and send your friends astronauts to their death! Or, only being able to blow yourself up.

This game is great with 4 players, possibly 5. With 6 it's VERY chaotic and hard to keep track of everything. There's very little in the way of making sure someone else won't compete with you unless you have an overwhelming majority in areas, something which is difficult to do, but again, that's the purpose of the game. If there was more of a progression and balance in how the ships launch, it would be a more interesting game.

RATING: 8
This is a straightforward 'resource management' multi-player game set in the Victorian steampunk era and is reminiscent of Onwards To Venus in many ways.

Players are trying to wrest minerals and resources discovered on Mars before their rivals can achieve the same thing and promotes tactical play with cards used.

An enjoyable game.

Nice area control game. I love smallworld better, but this is a mars theme and has some hidden elements in it. Countdown to 0 is very thematic when activating the 9 personage cards.

Thank you SS 2015!

Played with 2 and 3. Do NOT play with 2...it does work...but nowhere near as good with more. Go in expecting to have your plans foiled. Definitely, one where you have to adapt to having your plans messed with. Fast paced with little to no AP. Good for gamer groups (might be a little heavy for non-gamers).

As with the two "King of..." games, Libertalia and Mission: Red Planet occupy two very similar niches for me. Honestly, I could play either one and be perfectly happy but, if you twist my arm, I suppose I'll have to give the advantage to this one.

Players have a smaller selection of role cards and access to all of them at the start. Again, it's really about when you use each role that drives the tension of the game. Rather than fighting over a split of the loot this time, you're trying to set yourself up to have control of the best spots on the board when it comes time for scoring.

Each player can also gain access to hidden scoring bonuses, making the final score uncertain until the very end. There's sabotage, infiltration and it always creates a laugh. I like the added elements and tweaks of the second edition, particularly Phobos and the possibilities it opens up.

It plays a larger group very well, isn't terribly difficult to teach and doesn't take that long to play even with 6 players. I like area control games and this one is possibly one of the most accessible and entertaining of it's kind. A game that both my gamer friends and my non-gamer family can appreciate in equal measure.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Comment after first play (with 5): Meatier than I anticipated. Quite a lot to track with role selections, things happening on ships and the power struggle occurring on Mars and Phobos. I'd rank this above the more casual ~1h games, but this might still be accessible enough to get casual gamers onboard too.

The second edition of [b]Mission: Red Planet[/b] is new to me, but I've played the previous edition before. However, I had only ever played it two players and it was pretty abysmal at that player count. With four players, the game really shined and was a good combination of chaos and control. I went for a Phobos heavy strategy where I used the Soldier to eliminate other astronauts and land on Mars, but in the end it wasn't quite enough to wrest control from another player who had holed up in the center locations.

Highly recommended (at the higher player counts).

It's amazing how quickly this game plays. It's utter chaos, but it's a ton of fun and done in an hour or less.

RATING: 6
It's sad to watch a player get stuck playing a useless card on a turn. It effectively means they have almost no chance of winning unless they were already in a position to lead somewhere else.

Games should never punish players for having their strategy stomped on by other players. It's especially disheartening if it happens a second time since everyone at the table knows that they now just have to go through the motions for the rest of the game.

The astronauts are also difficult to count accurately since their flags are the same height as their heads, making the count difficult. The spaces are also frustrating to keep track of since they're very awkward shapes that can easily trick players into thinking they are dominating a space when there are actually more figures in an area that look like a separate space, but it's really just a wonky shape.

I'd recommend making a catch mechanic so players don't get left behind because of a bad round or two, either make the flag taller or the astronauts, and outline the spaces in color-coded borders for easy identification of the limitation of an area. The board could also be much bigger.

There's some solid gameplay here, but for me a bunch of parts just need to be tweaked.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The simultaneous role selection is pretty awesome and is a lot of fun.  It was definitely my favorite part of the game.  I do feel as though the board didn't quite fill up enough before the end of the game.  There was only 1-2 times where there was competition for an area, and a lot of the occupied areas were taken in the last round as points grabs.  That was a little underwhelming.

GAME: Auf Achse
RANK: 2428
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pick up and deliver with a roll and move mechanic, and a suitable trucking company theme.

This is an older Kramer classic.  The caveat is that you must play this with the updated rules, which are easy enough to implement for any version/printing of this game.  The goal of the game is to make the most money, and the game ends when all of the public contracts have finished and one player has finished their own contracts.  Essentially you move your truck along a map of Germany (the map is very drab and dull unfortunately), and you load up and/or empty out your truck when you arrive at appropriate city destinations.  These destinations will be dictated by your contracts, which pay out a certain amount of money for goods delivered between two different cities.

The mechanic is roll and move, however you roll two dice and choose the better result.  Also, you can "stop short", and 6's are wild.  There are city destinations, but also wild card destinations, where you draw an event card.  In the new rules (a must), the majority of the cards are positive, so it is often worth picking up some cards.  If you land in a city by exact count, you have two choices (after loading/emptying your truck): a) you can put a new public contract up for auction, and as the auctioneer you have a slight advantage, or b) you can discard a public contract, which speeds up the endgame.  Contracts are where the money is, but they're only valuable if they are completed.  You can win by having a short racing game with few contracts or by getting and completing a large number of contracts, but you can easily get stuck with these in your hand by game end.  You can at any point purchase trailers, which are expensive but useful for making multiple/larger shipments.

The components are great, particularly the trucks, the gameplay is straightforward, and there is some planning and interaction.  The theme makes sense and the game is accessible.  It plays from 2-6 players, although I have only played 2-4 it scales well for those numbers at least.  A solid game worthy of it's 1987 SdJ (again, make sure to use the updated rules, cards, etc., as they reduce the luck element, and shorten the gamelength).

Fantastic racing and bidding game on German highways. Bid for deliveries and roll 2d6 (choose one of the dice for speed). Caution symbols draw event cards. A one compels one to move a construction block. Exact entry into a city activates the bidding block: discard the latest or choose 1 of 4 to auction. Purchased trailers can extend trips.

I don't understand the low rating.  This is an excellent family game.  I think maybe too many 'gamers' saw "Spiel des Jahres," then played this looking for El Grande, and were disappointed, all the while pronouncing it "Spiel de Jar," as if it is a French award.

[b]Spiel des Jahres 1987[/b]

[i]Posted: 4/1/06, Rated: 5[/i]

No, this isn't some sort of April Fool's Day joke (see posting date).  [i]Auf Achse[/i] is the second [i][geekurl=/wiki/page/Spiel_des_Jahres]Spiel des Jahres[/geekurl][/i] (SdJ) winner I have played that just didn't thrill me right out of the box (see my comments for [i][thing=256]Mississippi Queen[/thing][/i]).  The components are cute enough: little trucks with flatbeds onto which you can load freight blocks.  And the streamlined concept of taking contracts and then trying to deliver them is inviting enough for me to want to play this game.

[i]However.[/i]

I feel like I'm missing some integral part of this game: the [i]fun[/i].  Okay, I want to buy contracts that are along my route.  Try to have two contracts (or more, with trailers!) loaded at the same time if possible.  Keep your opponents from buying convenient contracts cheaply.  I get all of it.  It just hasn't yet coalesced into a compelling game experience yet.

Maybe part of the problem is the "closed auction" system.  What I mean by that is the auction bid increments are forced: you can't drive up the price beyond a certain extent.  Playing with open auctions adds a little more interest to the game for my group.  Outside of the auction system, there is little opportunity for "ganging up on the leader."

The Event Cards in this game are quite frivolous, and feel like Chance cards from (gasp!) [i][thing=1406]Monopoly[/thing][/i].  That's not necessarily a bad thing, as they allow players who are falling behind to take some risks in an effort to fulfill a contract quickly, or to use a "Stau" (traffic jam) event to block the path of the leader.  The cards do add some spice to an otherwise bland game.

I'll continue to play from time to time, and perhaps I will find the right set of people and variants to make it truly shine.  Until that time, someone else will have to suggest it.

I can see this game as one that my non-gamer friends would like---it's a very relaxing game, with a little bit of meanness, but not much.  The trucks are nice to play with.  I'm not too fond of the die, though, because dice and racing games don't make me happy, especially since getting public contracts, the bulk of your profit-making, in Auf Achse depends on landing on the city space exactly.  But replace the die with A-6 cards for each player (from a poker deck) and the game impoves by quite a bit.

Playing this as spedition on ios.

I feel like this does push-your-luck with the contracts and dice rolls, and pick-up and deliver, both kinda poorly.  It's just a mix that I don't know many people would want.  Particularly as push-your-luck is fun in short bursts where winning and losing happens often----and pick-up and deliver games usually last at least an hour.

I get some of the appeal with routes and contracts, but I'm not a huge fan of this game.

When I play a game like Auf Achse I just get ticked off. How in the world has a game with such a solid design that won the Spiel des Jahres award never been published in English?!? This game perfectly fits the theme, has a lot of interesting choices throughout, and was simple to learn. I like the way you are constantly calculating out how you want to route your truck in order to maximize the number of contracts you will be able to fulfill. The auctions can be a little tricky for new players, because you don't realize how much grabbing one bad contract might cost you. However, about halfway through the game you totally can understand what is going on. I would love to own Auf Achse, and wish that some US publisher would introduce it here.

RATING: 6
I like the action that takes place, and the fact that it always seems to end with a tense race (reminiscent of other older family games, such as Linie 1).  It's a little bit hard to teach -- for example, a contract goes up for auction or discard if you land on a city by exact count, but not if you stop early because of doing other things in the city; however if you roll a six you can choose to stop in the city by exact count or not, so it's up to you whether to mess with the contracts or not.  It's a simple game at its heart and the non-intuitiveness seems to come from a desire to crank down the luck factor.  For most hobbyists, this is a noble goal.

The contract auction works even in two player, where it bares some similarity to Medici vs. Strozzi, but even so I'd probably play the simplified version when playing with just the wife, since that version is so much more streamlined and straightforward.  Of course it's more lucky, but that's rarely something I complain about.

UPDATE:  Do not play this game with six players with an important sporting event in the background.  (Of course, you could say this about many games.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It's nothing deep, but I found this fun!  Planning your routes on pick ups and deliveries and trying to be efficient in that is what the game is.  I like that if you roll a one you can place the road construction somewhere, usually screwing someone.  A bit of take that is always good.

Second play, down to a 5.  I'd play it again but man, in the six player game it just seemed like you could get boned almost every turn.  Nice production but I'd rather play many other games.  

Traded.

It has dice for movement and event cards..

But you roll two dice and select one so you're not entirely dependent on luck and even if you only get two ones then you'll be able to block others.

It's the event cards that make the game feel a bit dated but taking an event card or not is usually a choice.

I don't care for how much luck affects the game: movement rolls, event cards, and even your starting contracts.

I much rather play Thurn & Taxis, which scratches a similar "route planning" itch for me but in a better way.

A very dated game. I actually rather liked it as a kid, but then I didn't know really good games back then. Auf Achse just happened to compare favourably to Monopoly - which game doesn't?

There's a reason why this game is long forgotten, while Scotland Yard has real staying power and is still being sold. 

Oh yeah, the game also gets a prize for most ugly map... Hm, I recall playing this at the time of reunification and we were somewhat disenchanted that they'd left Leipzig, Erfurt & Co off the map. That's just so wrong. In the mid-eighties there was plenty trade between the East and West.

Kramer sure has come a long way since. Though he does come up with mediocre games nowadays as well. Witness Versunkene Stadt...

The theme may sound a little dry on this one, but this is a very fun game.  We hesitated to get this due to the German text on the cards, but now that we have it, we find that the cards come in to play very rarely, and it is not a problem.  We always play two-player, and even auctioning off the contracts works for 2 because bids must be made in pre-set amounts.

A fine family game, but a bit too much luck for gamers. The card that rotates that requires you to go to Munich is a big problem. If it starts rotating quickly enough, no one can get far away from Munich. Which makes it rotate faster. And munichs gravitational pull gets stronger, increasing the effect.

A good enough game in its day. There are better things out there.

Hmmm... I'm beginning to feel that the older games that get rereleased are still older games. Having not played this until now, and not having the nostalgia factor, it definitely feels dated. I probably would have loved this 20 years ago. Still decent as a family game, but needs to be played quickly and not too seriously.

I splurged and got the ArtsCow canvas USA map and USA/English event cards and contract cards. So I'm into the game like $80 or so. Probably not worth that. Oh well.

For a game that's been around for decades, it's impressive how well this holds up - and shows why it deserved its SdJ win. 

On the surface this looks to be just a simple pick up & deliver game, but the selection of contracts is a crucial part of the game - you have to plan out which routes you might be able to complete along while working through the ones you already have in progress. And on top of that the occasional event card will change things up in unexpected ways - some good, some bad.

Decidedly satisfying, I look forward to playing it again soon. And it's good to see that you the language dependence is minimal - a simple translation sheet for the event cards is all you need.

A simple, old American-feel boardgame from the king of German designs? Huh? It's easy to explain, a bit too long, and fairly harmless. I'd imagine it would be perfect for middle-school age kids and families. You bid on contracts, pick up loads, and truck them across Europe. The one-die roll movement adds a heavy random element, and cards drawn can throw further random wrenches into the best plans. Which is a good thing to prevent the most calculating players from walking away with the match. Also has one of the most notably awful artwork in recent memory.

Fun pick up and deliver game. To me this game is a eurogamer's crayon rail game. There is more player interaction, bidding is introduced, luck is a little more present, and there are a couple opportunities to directly mess with your opponent's plans.

Fun game. There's dice and auctions to inject uncertainty into what is a systematic task of planning routes and maximising profits, keeping things tense. Unfortunately, this doesn't happen throughout the game. My recommendation is never play with six and to keep the game to under an hour.

[1 play] Pretty groovy light fare.  Kind of a novelty shipping things by truck for a change instead of by rail!  I'd like the board better if it showed country boundaries (the game takes place not only in Germany, but also in Austria, Italy, Switzerland, and Denmark).

Far too long for its depth. Far too swingy in the events. Roll-and-move may have been par for the course 25 years ago, but it (along with many aspects of this game) has been outgrown.  I like contract fulfillment, but many games published since have done it better.  Ultimately, the randomness overwhelms careful planning.

I only every play this on BSW but I enjoy it when I do. I also suck at this game. I've never won and rarely come close. Why does this game have my number so well?  I don't know, but I like it for that reason. There's some good route-planning strategy and fun to be had here, and the contract option adds a layer as well. Don't think I'd ever buy a copy, but it's a great online option.

A simple, light pick up and deliver game.  The dice used to move don't seem to matter much because they rarely limit you from being able to go where you want to.  The key to this game is much similar to that of Ticket to Ride - optimizing your actions better than your opponent and rushing the ending when you are in position to win.  There is some player interact with the contract bids and the road black signs.  Nothing too incredible here, but it works for the right people/situation

Fairly fun delivery game, hindered somewhat by length/slow pace.  However, with more experienced players this may not be as much of an issue and I can see the game earning a 7.  Interesting bidding system for public delivery contracts.  Not quite enough variety to keep it interesting the whole time.  Too dependent on dice rolls & the trucks seem to move too slowly even when you roll sixes.  Would have been more fun & interesting with different types of jobs (time limits, etc.), different types of goods, more variety in vehicles & more modifications for vehicles than just trailers.

A good pick-and-deliver game with solid idea behind it. The gameplay is uninspired and unengaging - you just roll the dice, move your truck, bid for contracts, pick them up, deliver and once again. Don't get me wrong - it's a fine piece of game design. It just left me cold.

If I had got this game in 1987 we would have raved about it.  Playing it for the first time in 2008 it is OK, but just feels a little dated - as many games do from that era I guess.  Without the nostalgia factor from having played in back then it is going to struggle to get to the table here.  Yet there is much to admire with the route planning/auction mechanisms well done, and the games plays well and quite quickly.  And lovely trucks!

Old school pick-up deliver euro. Would only play with 3-4, too much downtime otherwise. Also, auctions are uninteresting. Back in the day this came out I can see it being a great game, but given I played this in 2013, it is lackluster at best.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I've found that the random factors overwhelm the bidding and the route planning.  The single die roll each turns creates too broad a range of movement, and the event cards are not well balanced.  Three of the other players in my group love this one, and I've had to suffer through several games of it.  I don't think they'll convince me again.  Interestingly, Wolfgang Kramer stated in an interview in 1989 that Auf Achse (which had sold over half a million copies by that time) was not really one of his favorites from his catalogue.

Get in a cabin, start the engine, hear the engine roar. Haul your goods across Germany, drive faster than others, fulfill your contracts and get money for them. If you're the highest earner, you win. 

Great game. Win the bidding for contracts. Keep an eye on where they initiate and where they end. Can you pick up all the goods?? No? If you have not enough space on your truck, buy a trailer. Haul more goods. But drive efficiently, because the roads are long and there can be traffic or closed roads or unsuspected events. So get behind the wheel and get moving. Very entertaining game and fun to play. Recommended to all. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not a bad pick-up-and-deliver game but the roll-and-move aspect is too heavily luck-dependent -- use of an averaging die may be warranted.

It's pretty straight-forward and so very accessible as a family-type game, with one exception: the endgame calculations can be tricky as you determine whether you should bid on another contract. There's nothing wrong with how this is done, it's just that it's a bit at odds with the rest of the game -- a "gamer's game" decision in an otherwise light affair.

I was finally able to track down a copy in the US a few months ago, but it sat on the shelf unplayed until this month. I read a geeklist (I think by Osiris Ra) about 'lost classics' or something like that and it reminded me that I wanted to get it out. Then another person from my gaming group commented on the same geeklist, so the momentum caught us. It's a very simple pick up and delivery game. It's got fun with a very simple rule set that doesn't get in the way. I've played it twice. Normally I like games at the maximum people allowed, but for this one, I think 4 will be the good number. It doesn't have huge choices, but that's not important to me in all games.

A fun quick pick up a delivery game.  Simple rules that don't get in the way of the game.

RATING: 3
Played the original 1987 edition (in Danish), hoping that this classic would still have something to offer. However, the game felt really dated, with several bits that could've been overhauled to make it more interesting. I also felt that the whole concept of having traffic and construction work influence the board was severely under-utilized. (Perhaps 'Stau' was less common in Germany in 1987?) 

I've had a look at the differences between my copy and the updated 2007 re-release, and I don't see anything that would make me change my mind about this game. All in all, I don't think I'll be playing this again, unless we're a 4-5 players looking for a very light experience.

I was excited to try this old pick-up-and-deliver game, but I was disappointed in it.  Players have to bid on the contracts in a weird, constrained way, and ultimately, they're not usually worth what you pay for them. There wasn't much variety in the game; you might find yourself working on the same delivery for a long time, but all the deliveries are kind of the same.  There was a lot of randomness, though.  I liked the idea that different loads are of different sizes, but in the context of this game it wasn't really worth it. (1 play)

Pick-up-and-deliver game with cool plastic trucks and mechanics that are pretty simple compared with today's games. I like it a lot as medium-weight/family-friendly game along the lines of Ticket to Ride. If it was published tomorrow with cards in English and a U.S. map, it would be an insta-buy for me, but as it is, American players' lack of geography knowledge slows the game down a bit, as everyone has to locate the cities associated with each contract card that comes out.

Vintage Kramer, jeepers I said it before and I’ll say it again, he has always liked his DIRT!  Apparently the early rules stink and the revised ones are much better, I played with the revised and heard about the original and would have to agree.  

It’s a decent but dated pick up and delivery game, the core game is good but it is on the lighter side and luck is a factor as is the screwage.  The auctions are decent and the variable game time is a nice option to have and actually where you have some control in how you end the game AND in how long it might go from the beginning by how many cards you play with.

Having been a fan of the crayon rail games, in which you pick up and deliver goods, I picked this up. I'm very happy I did. It not only has the pick up and delivery aspect but it also allows you to bid on contracts to fulfill. And the game plays in that 60-90 minute range which makes it a lot shorter than the crayon rail games. Very enjoyable.

I have the original version, and I havent yet played the newer one - from a quick scan there are two dice which seems like an improvement as one dice roll and move is a bit of a backward step in  my view.  For now my rating is based on the old version which is spoilt a bit by the roll and move thing, overall the rating may stay the same as its a bit of a flat theme with very little thought/skill required.

Straight-forward pick-up-and-deliver game with auctions-made-easy, perfect for family gaming.  For me, a bit too roll-and-movey, and a bit too much luck.

I played the original once or twice when it came out but never since. The revised 2007 edition reduces the frustrating factors giving more weight to the family-friendly but not lacklustre pick-up-and-delivery engine. Main changes are rolls with two dice instead of one, picking either one, more balanced event cards, no fixed order for completing the deliveries and a few smaller changes all intended to make decisions more important. It's still luck-dependent but now a discerning gamer can enjoy it while its appeal for the family gamer target group remained. Still worthwhile playing after almost 30 years.

Auf Achse is a harmless, fun game that does indeed show its age, but also reflects common characteristics with other Kramer games, both older and newer.  There is a huge amount of luck in the game, with the dice rolls and event cards, but it is still fun to try and manage your finances and block off the other players.  You definitely need to remove some of the contracts from the game - if played by the rules, I think the game would go on too long and overstay its welcome.  Use 2/3 to 3/4 of the contracts and you have a tight little race.  I like the big plastic trucks!

Still a very good route-planning game.  Players participate in a structured auction to acquire contracts.  I recommend playing with fewer contracts than outlined by the game.  I usually reduce the listed number by about 25%.  The roll and move mechanic bothers some, but I find it works well for this game.

Graphically, the 1st edition shows its age.  The contracts, while servicable, are nothing special to look at.  The board is a reasonable representation of Europe.  However, no help is embedded.  For example, it would have been simple to use a color scheme to tie the contracts to regions on the map.  The trucks are cute.

LIKE:

* This is a solid pick up and deliver game.
* Not bad for a roll and move game - although I do recommend using two dice and choosing which die you use to even out some luck of the roll.
* Most of the fun in this game is trying to purchase the contracts that work well with your routes to optimize your delivery possibilities.  

DISLIKE:

* For a simple game, it can feel like it is dragging as there is nothing for you to do on other people's turns.
* The unfamiliarity of Germany's cities can lead to additional length of a turn as players seek to determine where the cities on the available routes are located.

There are some interesting ideas in this family pick up and deliver game, but it's age shows in the amount of randomness. While the dice aren't obnoxious, they are a bit too much. For a 20 year old family game, though, it's nothing to sneeze at. Just not quite my cup of tea.

A good pick up and deliver game.  The bidding on contracts throws in a fun element of trying to make someone pay more for a contract they want, but trying not to get saddled with it yourself!

Having never seen this game before I recently played it, I don't have any nostalgia for how good it was "in its time." I'm rating it based on a 6-player session.  It was a nice illustration of the evolution and improvement of game design over the years, I suppose.  It's a little hard for me to believe that this was the SdJ.

This game combines many of my least favorite elements of Monopoly, Milles Bornes and Uncle Wiggly.  I would guess that the auction element and pick-up and deliver mechanism were great innovations in their time, but they are far overshadowed in my mind by the excessive impact of die rolls, card draws, and randomly and disproportionately allocated "take that" actions by opponents. I don't consider myself overly luck-averse, but this was a 2+hour farce.  It might be better with less players but with 6 there's far too much chaos for my taste.

Nice packaging, board and parts in this 2007 reissue of the 1987 Spiel des Jahres.  I like the landmarks pictured on the cities (which are explained on the lower half of the game box), and the contract cards are quite well-designed.

I could nit-pick and wish the rest stops had city names, and that there could have been functioning trailers rather than cards, even if they had cluttered up the board a bit.

Nice gameplay, I will need to learn that the order the cities have to be reached is important, unlike Ticket to Ride, where the steps of your progress don't have to be in a strict order.

Finally, finally got around to playing this. I do enjoy a pickup-and-deliver game and wish there were more out there. I have to say this one has all the hallmarks of a solid family game but really seems to have a bit too much luck to compete with today's euros.

Most of the luck comes from the cards. The events that are drawn can really help you. Additionally, you can get really lucky if a contract card comes up that you're in a good position to take while others are not. 

Disclaimer: Haven't tried the 2007 updated version yet. I'm sure after 20 years they came up with some solid improvements.

A truly awful game. It may have been fun in 1987, but if that's the case, it certainly hasn't aged well. One of the other players compared it to Mille Bornes, which seems about right. It's Mille Bornes with a dull pickup and deliver mechanic thrown in, as well as one of the worst auction mechanics I've seen.

Fun pick-up and deliver game that would be very good for family play.  Movement is controlled by a die, but luck is NOT overpowering in this game.  Good logistics and careful bidding in the auctions will usually determine the winner.  Also, a great way to improve your knowledge of central-european geography! Probably best with 4-5 players, as the game can go on too long with 6 (the game is turn-based, so downtime becomes a problem).

RATING: 6.7
The 2007 reprint of this seems like a major improvement, although I've not played by the original rules. This is a great entry-level pick up and deliver game that gives players more to consider than most roll and move games. The route planning, simple auctions and upgrade decisions all add to the strategy level here, yet the game is extremely straightforward, family-friendly, and pleasant to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun game, but a little too luck dependent. I tend to not like dice-rolling games because I have such horrific luck and my first time at this game proved to be no exception. I constantly rolled 1s and couldn't get to where I needed to, and just about the only time I rolled higher - even 6s - was when I was 1 space away from where I needed to go anyway! If you like dice and have at least moderate fortune with the accursed things, you should like this light, but interesting game.

Cute little rubber trucks, but the roll-and-move just doesn't make for good tactical play, and doesn't support enough of a chrome-y framework to make things interesting (the only good reason to have dice, in my opinion). Haven't played it since the 90's so off it goes...

Pick up and deliver game, with a bit of auction thrown in for good measure. I like how you need to plan your routes and make sure that you have shipments that overlap. There is a bit of interaction in the movement, but mostly you are trying to outbid others for the contracts.

In 1987 this won SdJ.  I'm sure it was quite innovative with pickup and delivery and tickets.  Not so innovative in 2017.  There isn't much interaction between players (beyond moving the road closed sign).  The game is dreadful with 2 players.  Passable with 4.  There are newer and better games out there.  Don't waste time/money to play this SdJ as it does not stand test of time.  I'm sure it did for 10 years (1997) but so many games have improved on the base mechanics in the last 20 years.

An old favourite from my later childhood (I'm biased through nostalgia). This is a light "pick-up-and-deliver" game with a little "take that!" action and limited leader mobbing, considerably random, but not fully. Probably not especially challenging for adults, but certainly family friendly (children age 10+).

I play the original version with the version 2 rules which improves the game considerably. It's a light pick up and deliver game where the delivery contracts are now auctioned or discarded at the behest of the other players as they move around the locations. Getting lucky (ie contracts that tie in with your route aren't discarded before you can auction them, when no one else wants them) appears to be the main determinant, but it's still an enjoyable way to spend an hour. Mechanics wise, the genre has moved on (for example, Valdora does a lot of clever things), but strong theming earns brownie points, and often saves the day for these type of old-school games.

RATING: 6
In this pick-up-and-deliver game, you auction off contracts and then drive your truck around pre-existing highways in Germany to pick up goods, make deliveries, and earn money.  The truck pieces in the game is super-cool, but the game itself is fun but a little on the dull side.  It's really difficult to judge the end condition, which happens after the deck runs out and one player completes all his contracts.  Often it seemed like more time was spent bidding on the contracts than actually moving around the board and doing stuff.

Classic pick-up and deliver game. Contract cards come out for bidding - each card has a pick-up location, delivery location, and a number goods that need to be delivered. The bidding is structured and only amounts listed on the card can be bid - card also shows the payout for each bid amount, so younger players or those slower in math can still make an easy decision. Luck and strategy combine well in this game. Sometimes you want to bid on cards, but sometimes you just want to raise the bid for others. Luck is a factor of which contracts come out and also for movement - which is based on rolling 2 dice and selecting one for movement. Interesting and cute pick-up and delivery game where players simply try to accumulate the most money the fastest. Very easy to learn and straight forward to play. Only variable is event cards, which can be good or bad, and the occasional road construction, which might get in your way.

RATING: 5
Sadly even with the 2007 re-release with new lenient rules hasn't addressed a couple of problems I have with the design. First one is geographical, though this applies more with non-German players so really only a personal problem: orientation to where to pick up and deliver is difficult to execute and remember, would it have been problematic for a small map like with the TransAmerica cards to highlight in two colours the two places in the contract? Obviously this is a game in which you try to economise on your movement by doing contracts closely related to a network, but the way the contracts have been designed makes this hard work. So a case of too much text and ignoring the "right-side" of the brain by making things more visual so user friendly. Actually this has been done far better in the cube-disc contracts in Logistico.

The second problem is working out the value of the contracts and how much you are willing to pay at the auction. This too is much like work, though it can be considered a good teaching tool but I prefer something less mathematical.

All the effort to work out routes and the worth of contracts to you, then add an enormous amount of luck rolling the dice and what was the point? You should try moving four spaces in four turns and then turn around and tell me this game doesn't have a glaring problem. When you put a nice string of routes together the game is more rewarding, but essentially my main beef is that the game is about 45 minutes too long for what it is.

This felt like it inspired Ticket to Ride quite a bit. Here you bid on contracts that you have to pick up at point A and drop off at point B. This is very similar to the tickets in TtR. The event cards are fun, though we found the card "Inspection" to be broken. We played with the revised rules on the old board, which was no problem. I'm not sure how I feel about this game though, I think upon reflecting it was better than I thought, but not as good as TtR.

I found this to be a rather fun, light pick up and deliver game that I think of as Empire Builder Lite.  There is a fair amount of randomness in the die rolls, but this seems to be mitigated somewhat  by the desire to stop often so that big rolls don't tend to be used all that often.  The real decision making is determining which public contracts to go for and how much to spend on them as well as determining proper order of filing.

Because only some of the contracts are used each game, and because it's unlikely that many event cards will be used in the course of a game, each game takes on its own character.

A fun but perhaps dated game that suffers from bad movement dice rolls and length that surpasses the amount of fun that the game offers.  I'll surely play this again, but with fewer contract cards and with cards from 1-6 to indicate movement, that you have to use up before you can move again with them.

This should showcase what is fun about the game, which is delivering orders, managing routes, and blocking people out.  I suspect my rating will go up.

This one is decent, but it does show its age a little.  When we played, we felt like the game was a little too simplistic in the auction; granted, this game came out twenty years ago before the major surge of auction games, but we felt that the way the game "dumbed down" the auctions to five options and their potential payouts was a bit much.  Also, the use of a die to roll for movement was a little clunky...

An old timey pick up and deliver game with trucks in Germany! Several contracts, specifying pickup/delivery locations and load size, are on display. Players also start with some in their hand. Trucks start with a capacity to hold 6 goods (generic bits), but players may buy trailers at any time to increase capacity. On your turn, you roll a d6 and move the exact number, unless you are making a pickup or delivery in which case you may stop sooner. To pickup, just add the # goods to your truck (must have capacity). To deliver, return cubes to supply and take the cash payoff. If you roll the exact amount to move to a city (and do so), or if you roll a 6, you may put a single contract up for auction (open style) AND you only have to match a bid to win the contract. A won contract is immediately replaced from the draw pile. If you roll a 1, you may move the obstacle to any non-city position on the board (except one in far north). If you land on an event space, draw an event card and do what it says (some good, some bad). The game ends when all contracts have been auctioned off and a player completes their last contract. Most cash wins!

-----
This is a decent game, especially for one that came out in 1987! The dice may smile on some more than others, but generally the randomness of the rolls evens out over the course of the game -- it's more an issue of maximizing your efficiency, to pick up and deliver goods to fulfill as many contracts (as much $) as quickly as possible, without significant changes in your truck route. Of course, you also have to bid wisely for the contracts (and be sure to complete them before the game ends!)! However, the events are much more random and could significantly affect the outcome. Still, it played pretty quickly (with 3).

But then again, I adore strategy and especially route planning games, this one comes with great looks, too. You move around with dice yet you need to plan smartly to win and not have the best die roll. I like it with more players when the board gets more crowded and more people bidding for their next assignment, yet a two player game can be nice, too, when you can do giant, complicated routes. Great game all over!

This is quick-playing and well-tuned pick-up and deliver game.  MUCH better than say Empire Builder since it hits all the same buttons but plays in a fraction of the time.  If you like this kind of game, you'll love it.  If you don't, you won't as there is no other real mechanic going on here except that.

Good solid game with a decent amount of strategy for a pick-up-and-deliver game.  Card deck is only in German, and it's not easy German, so you will want to keep a translation handy.

RATING: 6.5
Works pretty well with 4.  Not a good choice for 6.  Luck is built in with event cards and the roll of the die for movement and the chance to block another player's path any time you roll a one!  Skill comes in with auctions and route selection and hand management, but there's still plenty of rough and ready charm about the hard knocks in the game.

Pretty neat pick up and deliver game.  Lots of opportunity for strategic play with enough randomness to keep you on your toes.  The roll two dice and choose the one you want is a great improvement for the genre.  **UPDATE** played with 3 and 4, I might avoid playing with more than 4.  2008/11/05

This is a pretty light SDJ winner.  Players have to have a tolerance for blocking, bad die rolls, and wildly variable event cards if they are to enjoy it.  I don't mind those sort of things in light games, so I think Auf Achse is pretty good.

This one is still fun, although game design has come a long way in a few short years and some elements of Auf Achse now feels a bit dated and clunky in comparison with some more recent and streamlined designs by Kramer and others. Player aids also are lacking: the contract cards absolutely should have included mini-maps to show where the cities involved are located. Overall, however, this game deserves to be included in the "classic" category and has held up well.

RATING: 7.5
This is an oldie but a goodie. Very nice components with the goods fitting nicely in the trucks. The game took a bit of learning as the cities used weren't too familiar to all of us, but after one game it was easy to remember where everything was. I printed English versions of the Yield cards, which made the game very easy to play for us non-German speaking players. I really enjoyed the screwage factor caused by the Yield cards and the overall game left me with a similar vibe as Viking Fury: Fire & Axe. I really enjoyed this game and am looking forward to playing with 5 and 6 players as I think a more congested board might make it more interesting.

Auf Asche was a progressive design 30 years ago. This title essentially defined the modern euro pickup-and-deliver game. The Revised Edition adds a die and tones down the negative event cards and is strongly recommended.  This is a clean, simple game that is a blast with the right bunch.

Auf Achse is an older pick-up and deliver game that is a little on the lighter side. You are dealt a starting hand of cards. Every card shows a pickup location, a destination and the payoff. There's also a schedule for bidding for the card (which isn't used for your starting hand). You roll two dice to move, but use only one of the dice. A six is wild, but a 1 allows you to place an obstacle on the board.

When you stop exactly at a city where you have a contract, you can pick up goods, or deliver goods. There are various hazards along routes. When you land on one exactly you draw a card and do the thing on the card. Theoretically these can be good or bad, but it seemed like they were all good (which made my initial plan of avoiding them suspect). When you land on a city exactly you can start an auction for one of the contract cards on offer. If no one else bids on the card, you get it for free. If they do bid, they follow the bidding schedule on the card and you have the option to match the highest bid.

It seemed like there was a touch too much luck in the game. First off, the movement mechanic is dice. Rolling high number is generally better, especially a six. The order of the contract cards coming out, and whether they line up with your route is also a bit of luck. And then there's the random hazard card draw. Altogether, it just feels like a bit much.

This is a game that I might play with casual gamers or with my family, but if I'm playing with people who are able to handle something more complex, I'd probably prefer to play a different pick up and deliver game. There's enough options that fit that bill that I don't really see the need to play this.

About [thing=110][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=110][/thing] is a very simple pick and deliver game, also having auctions for the contracts and roll and move.

Its rules can be taught in few minutes and there is little depth to it: simply make the best possible use of your route, usually to start new contracts in the way to a deliver or very near a city were you are already going. The auction even limits the possible bids. 

The production value of the brazilian edition is poor - but it is an old game and the standards were different back then; but the mini trucks are nice enough at least.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Important: this is based on the new rules of the game, as I was taught them. Players starts with some money and two contracts, and each person decides a city to put the truck. After this, to go around, the player roll two dice and chooses one to use as movement. Numbers can always be used for less - if I roll a 4 I can move only 2. If the player picks a die showing a 1, she can also put a road block in a road, anywhere on the board.

If the truck of a player reaches a city, any city, with the exact number needed in a movement, an auction might take place. The person either chooses one contract to start an auction for it, or discard the first card in the queue. If an auction occurs, the person to the left of the current player starts the bid. Everyone can give only one bid, and the amount to give are fixed on the contract card. Once the round of bidding reaches the current player, she can either don't bid (the person that gave the highest bid wins) or match the highest bid given (the current player wins).

Contracts have three other information: the route (the starting city and the place to deliver), the size of the cargo (usually from 2 to 5; the trucks, without add-ons, can hold a maximum of 6 cargoes), and the amount that will be paid once the contract is done. There are no limit the the amount of contracts a player can have in hand, but open contracts are limited to the capacity of the truck.

During the route, players can end their movement in some special places which activate events. These are resolved immediately - and some are good, and some are bad.

The game ends when there isn't more new contracts to be taken and one player finishes all her contracts. Then the person with the most points will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
There are a few, and all are simple:
- Which dice to use for movement (both to go to places and to trigger events and/or to put a road block);
- Which contract to put to auction (or if to discard a contract);
- How to make the best use of the routes taken (to deliver faster and to be able to start new contracts);
- Which order to start and fulfill the contracts;
- What (and if) to bid in contracts.

As is possible to see the game offers a good range of decisions: they simply aren't hard to make most of the time: the most difficult one is how much to bid, both to put pressure and make others spend more, while also gaining contracts paying as little as possible.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Easy to teach and to play;
- Offers a decent number of decision points, while keeping itself light enough to work as a family game;
- Downtime is lessened by the auctions and, in the late game, without auctions, the pace tends to be fast.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- A good amount of randomness coming from the dice to move and event cards;
- Some take that, but not all that much, nor they are crippling;
- Poor production value (for the brazilian edition);
- There are imbalance in the value of the contract to the route and number of goods, but that is why there are auctions for most of them (but not for the starting ones nor some that can be taken by events).

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Noticing that pick and deliver have traveled a long way since 1987 and are delivering more nowadays. However, most are of a different weight than [thing=110][/thing], usually being on the high end. But we do have games like [thing=157403][/thing] and [thing=111417][/thing], that manage to be light and, well, better.

Still, [thing=110][/thing] works well as an introduction to pick and deliver games, both in a family environment (the take that isn't too mean) and for gamers groups, as it is so simple, easy to set up, play and tear everything down, alongside a relaxing time with constant (but not hard) decisions. While [thing=110][/thing] isn't all that good, and it does feel a little outdated, you could get a lot worst.

As a SDJ winner, Auf Achse disappoints. Perhaps this game has aged and is no longer the game it once was since the gaming scene has since evolved. This is very simple pickup and deliver game with somewhat minimal interaction between players as they haul cargo between German cities via trucks. Players interact by temporarily blocking opponents' access to certain highways with a traffic sign or by outbidding opponents for public contracts. Once goods are delivered, a payment is paid to the trucker who initiated the delivery. The biggest frustration in this game is the length of the auction which occurs almost every turn during the first part of the game. Players are almost always able to land directly on a city by direct count of the dice roll, thus triggering an auction. This becomes extremely tedious and disruptive to the overall flow of the game. My truck barely budged for multiple rounds in the earlier part of the game. The bidding could be improved by having a once around bidding process like Goa. Instead, players can go around and around outbidding each other. Thankfully, players can only bid for set amounts per auction. The amount of goods delivered per distance and the payout also feels a bit off. Short distance hauling with maximum cargo pays out quite a bit while hauling long distance with minimal cargo does not pay nearly as well. While this may seem like a good balance, I feel it does not pay to spend time traveling between cities to load multiple times before delivery. Overall, this is not Kramer's finest. I love his games, but this is not one of them.

Attracted by the picture. Studied more and found pickup & deliver / logistics. That made it worthy enough to purchase (2007 version).

Ooops, kind of overlooked that bidding for contracts is an "auction".  I pretty much suck at auctions. 

Hey, this is different.  Pickup/Deliver games can be multi-player solitaire.  The contract bidding here, though, means that every one has to remain engaged with each other.

Hey, at least it's not a tile-laying game like every other Kramer out there.  This is a light, pick up and deliver game that has some interesting economic components to it, but is not really different enough to make it outstanding.  It'd be good for families, I think, as the decisions are present and the components are great.  However, the cartoony graphics and trucks really turn me off.  The last thing I want to think when I'm playing a board game is that it's aimed at three year olds.

Old pick up and deliver game, which won the Spiel de Jahres in 1987. Bid on contracts and load up the goods, then drive around Europe and deliver them. Kind of roll and move, in that you roll two dice, and choose which one to use. If you roll a 1, you get to impede your competition as compensation. Event cards can pop up which can really hurt you, but mostly they're positive. Decent game.

1987 RELEASE

This is a pretty basic pick-up-and-deliver game, which I originally wanted to play because I'm such a fan of Age of Steam.  There's little complexity to this game, and more than a little bit of randomness (the cards and the dice play into the uncertainty, though the dice mechanism alleviates it somewhat), and the road block can be game-changing.  I'd like to give it another shot (or at least play the 1997 release) before writing it off completely, but I don't think this is the game for me.

Played the old version once face-to-face (with 5 players), and the new version a few times on BSW. This game is quite old, and it shows in some of the mechanics. The pick up and deliver system works rather well, but luck plays an important part, both in the dice rolls and in the card draws. Also, it might be a bit long for what it is (but most players in my only play were new to the game, and the German text on the cards did not help).
The new version definitely fixes some of these issues, resulting in more player choices (2 dice instead of 1) and a shorter game, which is a good thing.

Original "Auf Achse" by Wolfgang Kramer, 1987.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Extremely dated roll and move game.  While deliciously evil in how you can screw with others, not to mention the humorous situations that often arise due to the event cards.  Auf Achse does suffer from the gang up on the (preceived) leader syndrome.  There are also too many occurrences of people circling an area simply because the destination they want to reach is either blocked off or constantly occupied.  The pick up and delivery as well as the route planning aspects are well implemented, but is too easily foiled by frustration with the dice roll.  So instead of one complete and enjoyable experience, the two sort of cancel each other out into a mediocre one.  Granted we did play with the full complement of 6 and the game dragged on too long.  Probably better with 4-5.

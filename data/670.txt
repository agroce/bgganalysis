Bought this 75% off at a KB toy in the late 80s. Played it along with Freedom in the Galaxy over a couple of summers. Eventually sold it on eBay (dumb).

This game captures the action from the book, which centered on the mobile infantry, perfectly. As the navy barely gets a mention, it's barely mentioned here.

The game gets a lot of flack for its map. Which IS bland. Its a generic setup which serves to provide a generic selection of terrain types (savannah, mountain, desert, city, roads).

The detractors are being too literal. This is not so much a game as a gaming system. Scenarios are presented which serve to introduce rules but also suggest how to shake things up and design your own. For instance, think the map is crap? Hell, many of the scenarios in the game instruct players to ignore certain terrain types, and or ignore roads, and or ignore cities. IIRC the Klendathu scenarios instructs players to treat the whole map as savannah.

In short, don't bag on the map. This game would run on any hexmap. Or any hexbased terrain system. The book described NO geography for the planets is mentioned. Thus, a generic map that serves as a blank canvas for any planet.

There are brilliant mechanics here, particularly the possibility of claustrophobic tunnel warfare ... using psychics to contact arachnid brains ... using nerve gas Terminix style ... and nukes, nukes, nukes LOL

For the terran player, the wrenching experience of seeing individual troopers being marked WIA (and having to recover them), or worse, KIA.

I had great fun running all-out scenarios that had 2 platoons of MI landing on a planet to wipe out a large skinny garrison, only to discover multiple arachnid hives beneath the surface .... muahaha.

A LOT of fun against any other player that loves the book!

Geez, now I gotta buy a new copy! ... or manufacture an upgraded version. I have the digital files.

Of course, I must point out that the game is completely and necessarily devoid of the political, civic, and military philosophizing and commentary that makes the book a controversial classic .... all the game is is the surface chrome, the action and theme.  It's the surface, the mode, the forms, none of the justification. No asking why here, just do or die.

OK.  Could use some significant improvement, such as certain pieces being allowed to shoot more than just down hex-grain and in no other direction (basically, fire lanes only at 0, 60, 120, 180, 240 and 300 degrees).

Game has a lot of unrealized potential.  Needs a workover

My buddy and I were in the process of playing all the way through this when one of us bought Memoir '44.  Starship Troopers is a great intro hex and counter war game.  Lots of asymetrical scenarios, with each scenario teaching more of the rules.  The game is a little dry by today's standards, and there are two too many levels of damage, but I'm looking forward to finishing playing all the way through all the same.

innovative and fun with the ability to develop truly unique tactics particular to the capabilities of the terrans and bugs.  I'd love to see this game redone - it is true to Heinlein's book and not to the more hokey animation series and movie disasters.  Given its development in 1976, its artwork needs to be updated and variable maps would be useful.  Nothing else needs changing.

RATING: 7
One of the few book-to-game games that actually captures the feel of the book well.  Game play for the Terrans feels a bit like Ambush with individual soldiers and equipment.  Alien forces are nameless monsters to be slaughtered.  Play experience will depend on how much interest the alien player has in his forces.  A good alien player will make the game experience worth-while.  A poor alien player, or one who'd rather play the Terrans, will detract from the game.  Runs on the longer side.  [GTI Code: TPSD]

Unique vintage sci-fi game based on a well-respected property. If you can find someone sufficiently motivated to learn it with you, it can create an immersive experience. The theme comes across well, and it's a good choice for a hex-and-counter romp that won't take all night. If you like games of this era, this is a solid medium-weight addition. If you also like the theme, then grab it for sure; you'll find it easy enough to pick up at a reasonable price.

Haven't played enough to rate.  I like the way each scenario adds in rules, but that means I've played the first scenario like 12 times and the second scenario like 3 times and the third scenario maybe once.  The way that the bugs have hives and so can pop up anywhere on the board (from the marine's viewpoint) makes it a very interesting game.

I am a little turned off by the "graphics-dated map", and having to stack 10 troopers in one hex. Otherwise, I love how it tries to emulate the book and all the tension created by the hidden bug complex. This title is ripe for a re-design/re-imagining/updating.

One of the few games whose theme and play closely parallels the book. (Others being Knizia's Lord of the Rings and GW's Fury of Dracula). Sometimes called "Squad Leader in Space", this game has a programmed instructional manual to ease you into the heavy rules. Alien player has the burden of designing subterranean complexes and revealing them as the Terran player goes. For Heinlein fans and science-fiction gamers, almost a must.

I purchased this game on eBay, from a seller named LAGamer. It was advertised as complete. However, when I inventoried it, I discovered that it was missing Communications counter no. 2 (yellow critical installation counter) and a few blank counters. LAGamer said he found the missing Communications counter and would ship it, but stopped communicating after the eBay Buyer Protection deadline passed.

I subsequently purchased another copy in a BGG auction, from Mike Welker (BGG User Name: Mike Welker). It was also advertised as complete. However, after numerous shipping delays and an inventory upon eventual receipt, I discovered that it was missing a Delayed Action Remote, Listening Device nos. 1 and 2, Humanoid Warrior No. 24 and a Wounded in Action counters. 

I combined both partial sets to form one complete set, which I subsequently gave to a friend who had been searching for this game from his childhood. I would like to complete my second set, and am looking for the following:

Communications, No. 2
Delayed Action Remote, 1 piece
Humanoid Warrior (yellow), No. 24
Listening Device, Nos. 1 and 2
Wounded in Action (grey)

Unpunched till a few days ago, I was disappointed by playing first scenario with its introductory rules. We soon resorted to use the full rules (as by guidelines at the end of the rules booklet). That way it showed a lot of good points. Full of chrome. Not trivial. Maybe I'll raise the rating after a few more plays. It seems to have the potential for, at least, a 9.

I had this as a teenager in the ancient '70s, played solitaire and with friends.  I liked it. It was evocative and cool, but I thought the Troopers were too powerful to make it a fair game.  Maybe I'd feel differently now about the sneaky spiders. Like most of my childhood wargames, my copy didn't survive the transition from teenager to post-college adventurer. [Digression: I read the good novel twice, once as a kid and once in my 30s. Its emphasis on citizenship is surprising and deepens the book which is usually classified as juvenilia. Interestingly in that regard, the book defends whipping (approx, by memory) which I read just as that bratty American graffiti vandal was whipped in Singapore.]

I used to LOVE this game.  The novel is so much better than the movie and the game really captured the interesting power armor concept well.  The hidden deployment of the arachnic hordes was always changing the game.  The Skinnies were basically like the Italian Army in WW II...worthless and weak.  I loved the Y-Racks and that psyop munition, the 30 second bomb in the novel!  The game captured it well.

Avalon Hill.  A wonderful, combat oriented, futuristic, surface combat gamed based on the Robert Heinlein boo of the same name.  Good scenarios.  Clean rules.  This is a unique war game and is one of those games that doesn't get enough recognition.  This is not to be confused with the Hollywood movies of the last 15 years - although they are somewhat based on the Heinlein book as well.  Fun 1:1 game.

Decided to pick this up because I had a random urge to own a sci-fi hex-and-counter wargame, and this is the only game I know of that fits that requirement while supposedly being decent to play. Took a long while for me to get a game of this going, played the first scenario as the skinnies and only lost by one VP, which was interesting because I thought I was going to get my ass beaten to the ground. Something about the unlimited stacking rule for Terran units bothers me a lot, but my rating is optimistic for now. I want to play this more.

This is a tough one.  I really love Starship Troopers.  The book was fantastic and I'm a really big fan of the movies.  There is absolutely no similarity between the game and the book/movies.  The game is a very dry strategy game with a lot of rules, and I mean a lot!  I own The Order of the Stick Adventure Game and the rules to that game are quite hefty, they have nothing on Starship Troopers.

This game feels more like a chore to play.  Games should be fun, and maybe, to someone who is really into games like this, it would be.  I have kept it because it's the only game of it's type that I have, but I wouldn't be terribly sad to be rid of it.

The game follows the steps of Heinlein's Sci-Fi novel. An attempt to re-create the war against the Bugs and their Allies the 'Skinnies'. It might seem that the scenarios are unbalanced but a careful planning from the Alien player can deny victory to the Terran one. This is a well adapted sci-fi wargame; it has planning for both players, allocation of resources, tactics, surprise, ambushes, heavy weapons and several scenarios. The rules are well organized and straightforward guiding the player step by step from standard to complex ones after each scenario has been played. The game mechanics are  augmented by the articles found in the “General” magazine giving more flavor, introducing more tactics and fun! The game has been under-rated because one expects something simple with not very many parameters. Although the map and counters might lack today's printing quality, this is actual Sci-Fi wargaming!       

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A little dated now, but still a good game. It is very faithful to the book & nothing like the movie.

The counters were a bit plain & likewise the map, but the highlight was the player map of the board that the Bug player got to fill out with his tunnels. You could even extend during the game.

Wonderfully evocative of Heinlein's novel, this game drips theme.  The very different capabilities of the Terran and Arachnid units combined with a very workable hidden movement system for the Arachnid tunnels makes for an interesting game.

Very closely matches the feel and color of the Heinlein novel.  Challenging to play the opposition to the Mobile Infantry, but once the Skinnies and Bugs are mastered, one can have a lot of fun being "the bad guys."  Only drawback are the limited ways to lay out hives--after a while, they can get somewhat predictable.  

The M.I. have tons of capability and technology, typically dominating the surface of the planet but the opposition still can pick off a soldier or two.  Once the M.I. goes underground into the hive, things can get a little dicey, even with all the tactical nukes, nerve gas, and other toys.  While the aliens can die in droves, the M.I. can't suffer a lot of casualties.

One of the best Science Fiction games ever made; it still plays quite freshly, even today.  Definitely brings the Heinlein novel to life!

RATING: 7.5
Very much a product of it's day, with stacks (that require tweezers), factor shuffling to make your column break, and plenty of record-keeping ... but it also delivers a genuinely unique wargame experience, with the bugs swarming up out of the ground to ambush the M.I., and the ticking clock in each raid as you wait for the retrieval boat to come down. It is longer and a bit more demanding than it appears but Starship Troopers is a richly rewarding game, particularly for fans of the book (NOT the crap movie that came decades later). Quite a bit more lengthy, intense, demanding, and technical than it appears. Very low solo value. On balance I'm not sure the programmed instruction method is a positive for the rulebook, as lacking a good index having the rules scattered about in the order you learn them -- rather than the order you need them -- makes the book hard to reference in the heat of play.

I was a fan of Heinlein in general and "Starship Troopers" in particular years before the game; this is an honest attempt to simulate the warfare depicted in the book. Entirely different strategy and tactics by the Terrans and Bugs. The Humanoids are (just as in the book) secondary and added mostly for colour. One of Avalon Hill's first "programmed instruction" rules formats with several glaring errors and errata but nothing insurmountable. The game really takes off once you learn the subtleties of the bug tunneling and demo system and especially if you use the expanded rules and random scenario selection found in the Avalon Hill General Vol. 15 No. 1 article titled "Mission Scenarios". This expansion is where the game matures into a tense fight where the bugs have limited intelligence as to which Terran mission is being attempted. It is a very in depth article and major revamping of the game including several new planet and environ types and an entirely new point system, a must if you have or want to get this fine but somewhat dated game. A computer version would handle the hidden tunnel movement and related functions and keep the bookkeeping error free. THAT game I would buy in heartbeat. This rating is based on the game as revised in the General's expansion.

RATING: 10
SST is a great 'wargame' with a set of very novel rules that cover the subject matter perfectly.  This game is a stellar sci-fi game of EXTREME "asymmetrical warfare" between forces that have no parallel in human history, gaming or even fiction beyond the single, ORIGINAL book published in 1959.

If you like that, then this is a fantastic *wargame* that is HUGELY under-rated both by old grogs that "don't like fantasy stuff" and by today's light-euro-gamer-crowd that would prefer the "tactics" involved in the newer version of the game that has very litte in the way of rules or unit/weapon or even mission diversity to get in the way of the fun.

This WARGAME also has a huge number of options in the old (public domain) General magazine that was published in the 70s and this is a game that has very, very long legs.

Got lots of good play out of this one back in the day. Inspired me to read the book which became one of my favs too. Hated the movie, intrigued by the RPG although it seems too influenced by the movie (e.g. non-technological bugs) for my taste. I have The General variant counters, which add Terran recruits (for campaign game), heavy weapons, and Terran and Arachid starships.

A nice game and very true to the book which was part of its appeal.  The big two hive, two platoon scenario is full on.  As the Terran I gave the bug player a big shock by sending a squad or two of MI down a hive tunnel to fight my way to the brains.  Lots of good features including drift of the Mobile Infantry as they land, bugs popping up all over the place, tactical nukes.

This is a tense and exciting game though a Euro player might find it hard to endure the down time as your opponent moves (though for a wargame it's not so bad).  Can be rules-lawyered: e.g., I fire my nuke next to the MIA guy since he is worth less to the bugs as KIA than as a prisoner.

RATING: 8.5
I have to admit, I'm a big fan of Robert Heinlein's novel 'Starship Troopers', and have been since I first read a copy of the 1968 edition, as a kid back in 1980. So part of my love for this game, is tied up with the fact it gives me a chance to play out some of the battles of one of my favorite sci-fi novels.

The map is very uninspiring. My biggest lament with this game was always that the map easily could have been so much better than it is. While I like the playing pieces, I've found that AH's printing quality was often lacking with this game. I've seen numerous copies of this game, and so many of them feature badly off center print jobs on the counters.

I love the fact that the game includes troop drops, and underground 'bug' tunnel complexes, as per the book. I love the platoon - squad level organization, with an individual counter depicting each individual trooper. Also, the rules book is kind of neat & quirky, featuring some interesting sketches and images made for the game. One image actually shows Johnny Rico as a Phillipino, as per the novel. The rules are pretty simple, and easy to learn. This game screams out for new scenarios & mods... and AH did apparently provide many for this game via 'The General' magazine. I'm just beginning to explore this aspect of the game.

Not a "themed" game, but a real wargame based on Heinlein's book. Unfortunately the game is as ideology-blinkered and unbalanced as the book; fairly distasteful.

That said, the mechanisms are a credible recreation of the actions described in the book; the bug tunnels are a well done twist.  Still, the game is so asymmetric that I can't really see being interested in playing the inferior side more than once, to see how a scenario is set up. Skinny scenarios unfortunately completely unbalanced whether using the basic or advanced rules.

I think this might have been my very first wargame.  I was a big fan of the book and bought the game because of it.  Unfortunately, I thought it didn't quite capture the flavor of the book, especially as all the scenarios took place on the same terrain!  I found the game fun to play as the MI, but not as the Bugs, although this may have been due to my immaturity when I played this game as a teenager (not wanting to play the "bad guys").  Also, if this game had geomorphic mapboards I would have rated it much higher, but it is hard to immerse yourself into the role of fighting over different planets when they all look the same!

Love it, but it's a little long-in-the-tooth in terms of art. However, it is a significantly underrated chit-pusher which is asymmetric and has a unique form of plotted hidden movement.

Medium weight hex-and-counter wargame whose unique mechanics adhere faithfully to the theme of the novel; unfortunately, in some scenarios the outcome is determined more by the storyline than superior play.

"THE ONLY GOOD BUG IS A DEAD BUG!"

With the exception of the map, the components are terribly outdated.  I do love the programmed rules that allow you to jump right into the game.  Mechanics are pretty basic such as "Igo-Yugo" turn sequence, odds based combat results table resolution, etc. Overall, it's a nice piece of 70's nostalgia that is worth owning and playing.  Starship Troopers would be worth updating to today's standards.

Really wanted to like this, but always seemed totally unbalanced. Power gamers will love the MI, as each scenario gives them newer and bigger toys. Bugs on the surface are dead meat, underground they're dull. Skinnies are a joke. Power armour looks like "Bubble man".

I got this one early on in my AH gaming life.  At the time, the rules were more complex than anything else I'd played.  I loved playing, but often found it hard to find others to play with.  Book-keeping was a bit of a pain, but really added to the Arachnid's hit & run tactics.

My first experience with boardgames was growing up with this in the house. It was my dad's and I would just immerse myself in the rulebook and doodle my own Arachnid tunnel complexes and mess about with trooper drop spread. Especially when I got a little older and read the book, but I believe by then I had probably lost a lot of those tiny chits. One year I came by and my mom had thrown it out, it was tragic.

RATING: 6
One of those weird experiences from Avalon Hill. Years before the very well known film was released, this game  appeared. Based on the Robert Heinlein's novel (A visionary release?) It was a confusing element in the company game catalog (in my opinion). Some nice concepts, a poor graphic design (A TAHGC trade mark by the way) and funny to play but nothing more. Interesting for collectors only. Outdated for today standards.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A wargamer sets out to simulate the book and does a workmanship like job.  Except that the bugs are just too easy to stomp and the game plays too slow. The game gets a lot more fun for the bugs once they can expand their tunnels while the game is playing! I loved the book and would like to give a better rating but in all honesty can not.  I would love to get the rights to this work, polish it up and re-issue it.
UPDATE: Played a couple games with a fan of this game.  He took the bugs and stomped me flat.  He used demo charges to block tunnels that had become liabilities, was more patient about heading up to fight on the surface and used a few other tricks I had never considered.  I no longer think the M.I. have an advantage.  Have increased my rating of the game by a full point.
Note that some people confuse this game with the miniature game by the same name.  Do not make that error!  ;-)

It's been a while since I last played this, but it really does capture the feel of the books quite well. It's fun trying to recover from a particularly bad drop, for example. It uses programmed rules, which are fine for learning, but a touch dodgy for looking things up later on.

Although I have played a few war games over the years, I'm just not the wargamer type. Although the components are pretty decent, I find that the complexity of the Starship Troooper rulebook slows the game down into drudgery.

Ah, one of my first Real Games.  Couldn't get friends and family to play it often enough growing up.

Falls firmly into the category of "interesting, but not really worth the time it takes to play it."  I've not played any but the most introductory scenarios, but it's already too long.  The gameplay would probably speed up if I played it several more times, but it doesn't seem worth it to do so.  I do like the inherently asymmetrical warfare, and the races certainly do feel different, but this game is just a bit too dated to play seriously.  Oh, and if you're trying this brand new, don't bother with scenario 1.  You can very easily go right on to scenario 2 with little difficulty.

Three plays of the intro scenario in 2009.  Still don't have a good sense of how good the game is.

I played through all the scenarios back in the mid-80s and liked it quite a bit at the time, but I can't speak to the quality of the game anymore.

The troopers were unstopable but tunnel complexes w/ nucs and beating up skinnies was always a ton of fun!  A modern remake (not the fluffy AH movie version) would be welcome.

Bugs and skinny's along with humans in super suits. The movie was better. And the game is very hard to play well solitare.

Classic hex-based wargaming in the Starhip Troopers world. Like the hidden information the "bug" hives bring to it.

RATING: 5
Too much work for what you get out of it.  I did like the blind planned movement of the bugs, though.  Makes solo play a little hard, but adds interest.  Very dated.

I got this game in high school when it first came out. We had high hopes for it, being huge fans of the book, but never really got into the game.

The theme is great.  The game has so many cool ideas - lots of cool weapons and explosives, nuclear weapons, labyrinths of tunnels, capturing brains, and prisons.  However, they still managed to make a pretty boring game.  Lots of cool chrome don't make up for the fact that this ends up being a swarm/pile on attack game.  There are not that many interesting tactical decisions to make.  The accounting drags the game down.  You end up huge piles of tokens on hexes.  Game board is pretty ugly.  The teach you the rules with increasingly difficult scenarios is nice.

Vivid, faithful portrayal & extrapolation of combat described in the book. Extremely asymmetric. Fiddly fun.

First wargame I owned, so it has tremendous sentimental value. Evokes the book very well. Programed instruction actually works in this case.

Played only the first scenario but read trough all the rules. Looking forward to get more into the game - it has some really cool rules regarding the arachnids and their tunnels. The programmed instructions allow you to chose how complicated you want the game depending on the scenario you play. The rating is in favor of the publishing date - today i would only give it a 5 or 6...

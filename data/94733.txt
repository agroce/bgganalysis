Very light Lego RPG. I thought this was going to be better than it was. Moving one pip each turn gets annoying. Also the extra weapons seem pointless. I guess playing with more in depth house rules would make it better.

Lego Heroica is a good way to bring young children near to the fantasy-themed games and, more likely, to the ever-satisfying dungeon crawls: as for most Lego Games, they offer a simple but enjoyable basic gamesystem that can be easily changed, expanded and customized to appeal even grown-ups.

I can’t see anything attractive in Waldurk: the way its environment looks isn’t even comparable to any other set’s, the magic doors are clumsy to play and even this game’s own hero, the ranger, isn’t any good (most likely because he’s too emo-looking to be taken into serious consideration).

(2011-10-15) Wow.  Just Way Cool!  My son, 11, is all over this.  The combination of visual and tactile appeal to somebody into Legos combined with a decent set of dungeon crawl rules makes this a good bet for mixed kids and kid-at-heart adults (like me).  We bought all four boxed sets.  My son and I immediately added a few house rules to make the monsters more interesting to fight.

RATING: 5
Players play a hero, either a barbarian, a ranger, or a druid, invading the Waldurk Forest, and trying to defeat the Dark Druid.  This is one of two "medium" sets, of the four Lego Heroica series. Players on their turn roll a dice to earn 1-4 movement points to move their piece across the board.  If they end up adjacent to a monster piece, they roll the die again to fight it.  Combat results in either the monster being defeated, or the hero taking damage (or both).  Heroes have a melee or ranged ability that is triggered by one of the die results.  If the hero loses all his life, he must roll on future turns to regenerate back to his four starting life.  The game ends when the goblin boss is defeated - to the victor go the spoils.  Super cute Lego game, where you spend 20 minutes building the board, and about 5 minutes playing the game.  This set has two scenarios,  three different monsters (spiders, werewolves and the dark druid), as well as a few items to collect.  This is obviously aimed at the under 10 age group, and with that as the target this is a hit and would probably be rated a 6 or 7.  For gamers, it's a luck based roll and move game, and you probably should be looking at something like Catacombs for a fast playing dungeon bash, with some strategy and tactics.

My 5-year-old was obsessed with Heroica for awhile. I enjoyed playing with him when he went through that phase. Now that he's out of it, we don't play anymore. I like this set because it has the ranger character in it. I enjoyed it most when playing with all 5 sets put together into a large map.

RATING: 7
The "7" rating is for the Heroica system... the $20 packages (Nathuz & Waldurk) have some cool elements but really need each other and/or the Fortaan set in order to give you enough area to fight over.

LEGO Heroica is a great little game.  A kind of kiddo-dungeon crawl.

This module has a fun theme and a couple of different setups.  The variable enemies and treasure chests make this more interesting than Draida.  It's probably my favorite module. Can be linked to other modules.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Introductory dungeon crawl. On the plus side, modular components can be easily changed and/or combined with other Heroica games. The games are best when played in series, and the characters have an opportunity to gain items. On the down side, the game becomes redundant after a few plays. I invested in the series to teach the young gamers in my life the joy of dungeon exploring games. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a not too bad Lego set with some nice microfigs. It could be used as the foundation of a good Lego-built dungeon crawl. But the game itself is hardly interesting enough to ge y more than a few plays from my fantasy-loving daughter.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Bought it today, had a hard time deciding between the small package (Draida Bay) and the bigger Waldurk. The fact you got werewolfs had me pay the extra 10-12 bucks for the slightly bigger one. I've played it a couple of times already and with a few adjustments in the rules it's fun even for those older than the recommended 8 year olds. 

Slightly dissapointed in it being so tiny. It more or less requires two or more sets to feel somewhat complete which is crap as it comes with a rather hefty price, at least here in Sweden. 

Anyhow, good game and a perfect way to get kids into board games too.

Super-simple roll-n-move with minor power-ups.  Nifty when played with those in the target demographic or as mindless filler with childlike, potty-mouthed adults.

There's no meat here—it's all cake and punch.  If you eat too much you'll vomit a crimson plume that looks alarmingly like blood.  But it's not.[/q]

Like most LEGO games, it's really targeted to children. The great thing is the games can be changed to whatever you want, it's LEGO after all. Played once, purchased for parts for my LEGO collection. The Heroica line of games was nice because you could use it as a base for LEGO themed RPGs..

I give all Lego Heroica ratings the same assuming you are playing with the full set. Each game individually doesn't do much, but together it's a) super fun to build the map and b) offers a variety of ways to achieve the goal, a variety of goals, and a variety of ways to stop each other. It's a pity Lego shut down their game line before they could complete the map. I was looking forward to the last three installments.

I think this game is a missed oportunity. Such a good idea, such a nice board, such nice components, such a direct attraction,.... and such a lousy set of rules.
These rules are way to simple for the promising materials.
But then, I was maybe expecting too much. I was hoping for a lego variant of Heroquest, or something.
With the right set of rules, this can be a blast! Endless possibilities, building your own board...

[Children's game] Forest terrain with lots of new gameplay elements. The magic doors are an especially neat addition. The quest item is a disappointment though, since it is weaker than a staff.

225 pieces, including:
- heroes: barbarian, druid, ranger
- monsters: 4 spiders, 3 werewolves, dark druid
- potions: life, strength
- quest item: chalice of life
- 2 treasure chests
- 2 magic doors
- 9 spare bits not included in the count

A Lego dungeon crawler is a great idea, but like many Lego games the rules lack depth. Adding a few house rules would really beef this one up  - the modular nature of the boards and the intercompatibility of the series are a great feature and could lead to a really epic RPG.

Well this game is ranking fairly low on BGG, and I can't say that is suprising.

The simple fact of the matter is that this is meant for a very young audience. The rules are very basic, with almost everything being resolved using a single dice roll. Time to play is around 15 minutes, maybe less.

I picked this up for two of my nephews, and they love it. Definitely a good gateway game if you want to get the young ones into something more complex.

Kids love fixing it up but who's the target audience? The pieces are too small for 5 year olds and below...things will either go missing or keep falling apart. For example, your equipment rack is so tiny. Add gold, health points, bad guys you kill and you'll run out of room in no time. The game is too simple for adults. 

The game itself is a 'rush to the finish' luck driven die-driven dungeon crawl. The multifunction die has pips for movement and symbols to special attack and combat.

The goal is usually to be the first to reach the end point and kill the big baddie there.

Begs for variants to make it more than a simple 'kill the bad guy'. For example, the game Could be first to 10 VPs worth of stuff and assign VPs to enemies, for acquiring weapons etc.

Pretty solid basketball game.  It is easy to learn and initial fun is very high.  As time goes on, you realize that rebounding is the single-most important factor in the game, and individual defense doesn't really play much of a factor in the game.  

The strength is that it is easy to create cards from a stat sheet, so you don't have to buy updates each year.  But if you are looking for realism and the ability to create all-star teams or mock drafts, Strat-O-Matic is far more realistic.  Read my [url=http://www.geekdo.com/thread/441356/stasis-pro-basketball-a-nice-consolation-prize]review[/url] for more details.

This one is on par with Strat-O's basic game, but no way that it can compare to the advanced game, because shooting doesn't consider an individual's ability to drive, post up, or pop the outside shot (ditto for defense).  Offensive and defensive rebounding are not differentiated on an individual basis and creative passing does not play as important of a role.  But it's still a fine game in its own right as far as an introductory sim.

This set has an interesting combination of stuff...more for a player than for a collector.
The box is the 1978 edition box, but it's in pretty sorry condition:  It is dramatically sun faded, has blemishes around it, shows major shelf wear, and has one blown corner in the bottom box, and three blown corners on the lid.  The tape the thrift store put on is still there, as I was hesitant to do more damage pulling it off.
The contents of the box smells a little smokey.  The two boards are present, but the folds are loose and the playing surface shows wear as well.  The two clips to hold the board together are present, as are two dice that don't look to be original, and one red pawn.  
There are 14 copies of the Scoresheet, but the rules folder looks original (with a small math problem solved in ink above the title).
All the Team Cards, Fast Action Cards, and Fast Break Cards are of the 29 teams of the 2003-2004 season, and are all print and play, printed on card stock...probably from that year.
The homemade cards include:
96 Fast Action cards
29 Team Fast Break cards
and
29 sets of Team Cards with 14 player cards per team.

As I already mentioned, this set is not for the collector, but all the data is there to play the 2003-2004 season with those teams.  If you're a big time hoops fan, this may be for you.

Boy.  Add pluses to this.  A friend and I made up our own players by randomly drawing from our vast collection of player cards (at least 7 different years), made our own teams (32), and ran our own seasons (shortened).  Overall, from high school up until I got married, we played over 2,000 games of this.  Tore thru fast action decks.  Unfortunately, we used an 80-81 version so we had to keep using those cards.  Many hours spend playing, many more hours spent discussing, number crunching, etc.  Overall, best game I EVER got into.

Rating of 10 only for league/tournment play

I have the 8-based and 10-based editions. The 10-based is more fluent and realistic. I think one of the best stats-based games on basketball. I have realized tons of seasons for the 10-based version, not only with NBA players.

More of a football fan than basketball, but this is my favorite sports sim bar none. It has everything I want in a solitaire sim: stats, ease and speed of play, good depth, and replay ability. Though you would assume the game would have inaccurate statistics for such a clear cut, simple system, the statistics created are quite realistic and well done.
The one knock on this game is the power of rebounding, however some of that is negated if you stick to the stamina rules in the game. (or updated shots rule)

A bit longer to play than statis-pro baseball, so I don't pull it off the shelf as much. That being said, because I don't get to play these as much, and almost always solitaire, basketball lends itself to a shorter season than baseball. Very accurate.

RATING: 9
Own two copies of the Base 10 (1993 ed.) version. Very good but not perfect play-by-play simulation of an NBA game, so of course house rules were devised to improve a sound product. I know there are those who prefer the Base 8 system, but I prefer the fatigue rules in the newer system. The modified three point ratings in the 1993-94 cards imbalanced the game in favor of teams emphasizing three point shooting. This problem was solved with one of our house rules. Can't play anything close to a full season at this level, but playoffs are managable.

Several of my friends and I played this game ritually during our Jr. High and High School days.  We reminisce about it all the time.  This and similar football and baseball games are what occupied nearly my entire youth.  In the early 1990s, I created a computer game that replicated this game (for my own use).  I have sporadically updated it over the years.

Not bad, but the hard limits on shot attempts per player ruined the game.  Basketball players' performances vary greatly from game to game, and Statis Pro Basketball did not sufficiently reflect that reality.

RATING: 8
Fast paced and exciting; over the course of 4 years, we almost finished a whole season (1985 edition -- boy the Clippers suck). Love the fatigue rule. Hate that a high FAC number is always an airball. No offensive rebounds on foul shots? FAC pulls eat time on foul shots? We used dice instead, and made 88s into offensive rebounds.

Decent NBA basketball sim, which was simpler and (to me) more playable than Strat-o-Matic Basketball.  The main reason for the increased playability is that it doesn't take all day, which S-o-M Basketball is likely to do.  I had lots of fun with this in my college years.

Played it a lot in my adolescence, and gradually became too annoyed with its flaws - too little player variation (particularly blocks and steals), limited benefit of a high-assist player, home court advantage that could become too powerful late in a close game, etc.  Lots of fun at one time, however.

I used to love this game a lot, but it is ultimately a "watch the action" game.  You don't really make a lot of decisions in this game, obviously you set the line-ups, but that decision is little more than to have the best five guys possible in at any one time.

RATING: 6.5
After playing some of the variations found over the Internet, I had to knock the rating down from an 8.  It is too easy to manipulate the stamina usage (in both versions).  Plus, the foul system and fast break rules make it fairly inaccurate to have a draft league.

I am not really even that much of a hoops fan but I love this game.  I only play the Base 8 version though.  Purchased the Base 10 re-issue but I did not have the patience to learn the new system which was incompatible with all the teams all I already owned.

Decent basketball sim.  Biggest problem is that it cannot produce extraordinary games: no 60 point or 20 rebound performances.  It is good at reproducing overall stats from the players, however.  Plays relatively quickly.

RATING: 7
The use of a deck of cards rather than dice for this game was very interesting; an individual player could still have a bad day, but overall your luck tended to even out. The cards also served as the clock, a nice mechanism. We did use 8-sided dice for free-throws. The stamina system was terrible, although apparently that system has been updated. Enjoyable.

I really wanted to like this game, but unlike the other Statis Pro games, I felt this one left very little to the game players. You picked your line up, they preformed in a nearly statistically accurate way, and when they hit their player shot limits you pulled them. Maybe you got the rare statistical anomaly, but it was, well, pretty boring.

(Mind you, it was the best of a very bad, and small, lot of basketball games I played.)

When this game was current, it was one of my absolute favorites.  It was a great way to pass the time when I was alone thousands of miles away from home in Turkey.  Really do miss the good times I had playing this.  I kept meticulous records of all the stats and team records, playing a whole season and the playoffs even!  It has lost its charm among all the modern games however.

I had the 77-78 season and then later one from the late 80s (plus All-Star Replay's special '83 final four teams). They changed Stamina to Shots, neither of which worked great. Also, the deck seemed to have too many "skip XX cards," which lead to low scoring games. But it was fun, whether solo or with two. Probably more fun than Strat Basketball, but not as strategic as the Advanced version.

Used to love this game in the 80s.  We played a league one year to 26 games, 4 teams each, 4 players.  Then playoffs.  Never forget when my Knicks beat the crap out of the Celtics at Boston Garden by over 30 points, despite finishing in last place in the league.

In the late 80s I programmed the game in BASIC language onto my Commodore computer.  Then played a couple more leagues on there.  The random number generator was used instead of fast action cards.  the statistics used actual shooting percentages.

Played so smoothly in its original version, it actually felt like the flow of a real game. It had a little bit of everything and was just great fun. As with Statis Pro Baseball, the game has an excellent player fatigue system. 

Far more than dice, the Fast Action Card system makes a constant action sport like basketball or hockey translate well to a board game.

I confess I spent a lot of my youth providing up to date NBA player cards, keeping the game contemporary. As an adult I coded the data onto "Excel" as an exercise in clerical skills, and was able to get up to date in a quarter of the time. Strangely this lost something, but maybe that's just maturity. Essentially solitaire. One should have a passing interest in pro basketball. A lot of card flipping and clerical work (keeping score) renders somewhat the feel of a real pro game. Some tactical considerations with the player rosters, and whether to bench Jordan circa 1991.

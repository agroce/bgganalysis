Bought it as a kickstarter, I've played it twice.  It's a little long for my 9 year old's attention span, but she gets the concept.  We'll try again playing the junior version.  Played a second time with adults and loved it.  It's a visually attractive game, so pretty.

My copy arrived 3 days ago and I was so excited to finally get this into my hands. Today I played starving artists for a couple of times with my husband and we were completely amazed by the stunnig artworks and especially the gameplay. We had a lot of fun playing it. It's a great gateway game with a good mixture of luck and strategy. The rules can be explained to everyone in about 5 minutes. I can't wait to play this one with 4 players. Highly recommend this one.

Admittedly, this is only after one play, but this game could be so good if there were only some minor tweaks. I like the idea of the game and turns do flow rather quickly. The flaws come from the following:

Cubes being occasionally tough to tell the color as someone with no color blind and a colorblind friend of mine absolutely could not tell the difference between the yellow and the orange so we had to constantly let him know which color was which.

The other big flaw was the structure for the paintings. It feels so strange that it's only a few extra cubes for some of the big paintings which will give much more points and then a ton more paint. Even these didn't seem to punish the player food wise enough either. So it felt imbalanced and I felt that even bothering to do the 0 point pieces was in no way worth it.

A fun, quick light strategy game with beautiful components.  Luck may play too large a role in determining the winner for some tastes.  House rules to ameliorate unlucky cube draws might include "working overtime," allowing 5 cubes to be drawn when working (once per game) and/or "paint mixing," a free action allowing a player to mix paints in her supply according to the color wheel, e.g. yellow+red=orange, etc.

In our family of 3 (me, wife, and four year old daughter), Starving Artists gets a lot of play time on the table. My daughter finds it very accessible and easy to play with a little bit of assistance and my wife and I enjoy the competition. Definitely recommend it for folks to pick up and add to their collection.

Well this was another kickstarter disappointment.  This is only after 2 plays solo but the solo game seems to be just bad.  You are at the mercy of the card deck and cube bag.  Only being able to place up to 4 cubes per paint and take 3 cubes from the bag and only two actions per turn, you could be done in only 5 turns due to nothing but bad luck.  Way too luck driven for me in the solo game.  I will try a two or three player to see if it gets any better with your decisions mattering else it is off to the trade stack with this one.
[B] Edit:[/b] ok played with two and actually even worse.  I don't get it.  Turn one lose a food. 3 paintings come out with 8 or 9 paints required.  You have 6 random starting paints. You can do a free action and wipe the paintings but alas luck is not with you. All 3 new ones you can't paint either. So let's spend our turn trying to get paint. Draw 3. Get same colors I have can't paint any of the paintings.  Next player takes paint and wipes board.  Oh look a 7 paint painting I have 3 colors for.  Spend 3 paint to get it.  Now I have the 3 paint to paint it but only 3 paints left.  Ok next turn. Down to 3 food.  Starting to sweat it out.  Don't want to be inefficient so I trade 2:1 on a paint I can use.  Then add 4 colors.  Now I have 1 paint cube.  Ok I need 3 more to finish so next afternoon.  Player two does his thing. My turn I must take cubes.  Now I draw cubes and get none of the colors I need.  Crap.  Day 3 lose food.  Down to 2 food.  I have 4 cubes so can draw first.  I get the same 3 colors!!!!!!. But now I can draw again.  Look I got a color I can use next turn.  Turn 4. Down to one food have to finish painting or die.  Action one trade 5:2 and get the last two colors I need.  Finish painting.  Ok now I have 3 paint left.  No paintings and all the paintings on the market are 7-11 paint to finish.  Oh well. At least I can get 1 point and 2 food lol. 

Game is entirely based on luck.  You are at the complete mercy of the cards and draw bag.  Maybe if you could add more than 4 paint per turn or maybe stack the deck so all the 8+ paint painting come out later.  Nope this is a 2.  I will never play this again.

Interesting concept and lovely to look at, the gameplay just falls a bit flat. The bank will constantly run out of paint during the game, resulting in lots of turns where all you're left to do is draw blindly from the bag hoping to get the colors you need. The paint cubes are great, but you need to have a white surface to play on to distinguish them.

Love the theme and the feeling like you are painting pictures.  Timing is very important in this game and was a bit taken aback when I lost the opportunity to get a ton of paint because I didn't sell in a particular round. In the end the scores were close anyways which was a welcome surprise.  Definitely one I would play again.

Only one game in, played with my 5 year old daughter. We played with the simplified rule set. There was not ever a feeling that we would starve. Obviously in the regular rules, you don't get paid as much when you sell, resulting in a more tense experience.

Still need to play this with the advanced rules and then update my rating accordingly.

This is a light and easy game.  The choice to gather paint and art is fairly straight forward, which leads me to believe this game would work with a wide audience.  The "real strategy" in this game is deciding when to sell your art.  If you don't have as valuable of a piece as someone else you may want to hang on to yours until the next round...but you may find yourself in a similar situation.

I have several negatives.  First, the score track.  It's printed on the back of the top of the box (which is attached) and it makes for an awkward score track.  We just keep track of the points on your completed art and trigger the end of the game from that.

Second, the winner of this game is almost entirely based on who can get to the 3 point cards the cheapest.  We've implemented a house rule to combat this problem.

- During setup, separate the canvas cards into individual decks based on points (0, 1, 2, 3).
- Place each deck on the table and draw a single card from each deck and place it next to it's corresponding deck.
- When purchasing a canvas from one of the 4 available, the cost is 1 + point value. i.e. A 0 point canvas costs 1 paint cube and a 3 point canvas costs 4 paint cubes, etc
- As soon as a canvas is purchased a new one from that deck is drawn to replace it.

When you get paint cubes when selling a painting you can easily end up with little or nothing.  It's not fun at all when you simply can't survive (you need to feed yourself) without selling, but knowing that if you do sell, you'll get less than 30% of the cubes you "should" get.  We hate this.  We've implemented the following house rule to combat this:

- Highest value painting gains the player the first choice with 4 cubes on their first draw.
- Second highest value painting gains the player the second choice with 2 cubes on their first draw.
- All other draws are done in order of painting value and only draw 1 cube up to the painting reward listed.

We've played this game time and time again because we feel like there is a good game here.  We simply cannot find it.  We've adjusted so many rules, we've tried so many different strategies.  We just don't like this game.  :(

Little paint cubes serve as your currency and help you paint beautiful replicas of famous paintings from all different genres and parts of the world.  Fun game trying to be the quickest to get your paintings to market to either score points or paint six first, and not starve while you're doing it.  Not sure if I would buy this, but definitely would play it again!!

I was very surprised by this game, a lot of the kickstarter games I've backed have been very underwhelming.  Some have been played once, some after viewing haven't been played at all. This is light enough that the rules can be explained in under 5 minutes yet there's still a bit of strategy involved.  I'd say this is a very great mix of randomness and strategy for a gateway game.

When I read the rules I feared that starving would be a major threat but after several games nobody so far has starved though it has come close.

Not only is the game full of stunning artwork, with a clear intent to incorporate styles beyond the European masters, but the gameplay is a constant tug-of-war between getting enough paint to complete a canvas and stave off starvation, and making sure that the paint market is as full as possible when you sell the painting in order to maximize resource collection.  Full of small, but significant decisions, it never seems to paralyze a player.  Plus, everyone wants to touch the components when I bring this to the table.  Good choice by the creator to add custom food meeples as scoring and starvation trackers.

[b]1p[/b] [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] My first play being solitaire was a little tricky as I came to terms with both the game, and how to game the solitaire paint market drain. Once I got that down, though, while I had to plan, and accept letting my food get down to 1 once or twice, I had no trouble riding the waves of the game, selling enough art to survive, and end with the Professional ranking. Even so, I enjoyed it, and the "paint by numbers" appeal of placing the paints on the spaces is everything I imagined. ;)

Makes me think of Covert Action! The lack of structure means that while it could be awesome with people who get it, it will fall completely flat with people who don't.
Like most party games, you'll like it as much as you like the people you are playing it with.

For a traitor game, it was okay. As a party game, kinda meh. Coming up with the questions to ask was pretty awkward and after a while they became predictable. I rated this a 6.5? Time to adjust that. 5.3 sounds about right. Could replay but I doubt the rating will change.

Great group party game. I like this better than Werewolf. Just wish there were reference cards included for everyone so the spy didn't have to sneak a peak at the rules to figure out where they might be.

UPDATE: We played it again using some reference cards I found here on the Geek. Even though it wasn't a perfect match (a few locations were not on the card, and some on the card weren't in the game) IMHO it did make it MUCH easier to play as the spy.

RATING: 7
With the right group this can be a fantastic deduction party game. With a group that is very familiar with board games, it can be over analyzed and taken to seriously, which, when that happens, its flaws come out and becomes unfair and unfun.
This is more of a 'Play for fun, not to win' sort of game.

[I]tl;dr - A unique social game that doesn't quite pass muster for me. I much prefer [thing=135779][/thing].[/I]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

Spyfall is a fairly interesting social game where eight players compete to discover who among them is a spy. All of the genuine players know what location they are in, and what role they are playing in that location. The spy must figure out where the game is being played (among a list of 24 locations in the rule book), and the genuine players must figure out who among them is a spy. 

General gameplay is just a bunch of questions. The starting player asks a question of someone else, and then that person will ask a question of the next player, after answering the first question. As questions are asked, players try to pierce through bluffing and figure out who the spy is. 

I found this game enjoyable, but not quite enough to hold my interest. It's rather boring to be a real player, though it can be fun to try to throw the game with obtuse questions and introduce some chaos. Though, generally when I'm introducing chaos and disrupting strategies, that's a mark of a game I'm not quite enjoying enough. 

Recommended, if you really love social games.

It's a VERY interesting premise and creates amusing situations frequently. There is a problem though. The game demands confident, creative players, and as a result it is intimidating to many players. This is one of the rare party games which can induce analysis paralysis. After staring blindly , thinking REALLY hard, a nervous player will all too often give an uninspired clue which could easily tank the game. Pick your players carefully - this is not as accessible as it sounds.

Spyfall is the crowd-pleaser on this list. While not a full blown party game, Spyfall still accommodates up to eight players and is quite simple to teach and understand, especially after a few quick go-rounds. The central premise of the game, in which players ask each other questions and attempt to be vague, without being too vague, is brilliant and elicits many surprising forms of questioning. 

Spyfall has been a huge hit with my friends, especially those that don't consider themselves very interested in board games. It makes them excited to play it and see if they can pull one over on their friends or spot the one friend who isn't quite giving the right answers. It also allows for hilarious moments of blind guessing that are instantly memorable when the spy is discovered for an answer that is so painfully not appropriate to the location. And when you are the spy and are asked a divisive question, only to take a risk with a gutsy answer, and see it pay off, the thrill is palpable.

LIKE: Coming up with interesting questions.
DISLIKE: Fiddly setup with the multiple secret deck of cards. I'm not into social games. Not knowing all the locations can be a give away.

OVERALL: A clever game, it feels like the spy actually has a chance. It can be fun with the right group, but I'm not a fan of social games.

Spyfall has an excellent idea and is quite fun to play. However, it is a very very hard game, since sometimes it might be really difficult to come up with witty questions/answers without giving everything away. I guess that in some groups the game just wouldn't work.

RATING: 7
Good filler for up to 8 people.  You've got to have people who are good at words and thinking how to phrase things to make it really at its best.  It's easy to give too much away with a question.  Lots of fun and double entendres etc for those who enjoy a laugh in a party game.

Great deduction game which requires some verbal and analytical skill. 

I like the way you have to ask questions that alert your fellow non-spies to the location but not be too specific with the questions or answers so that the spy can guess the location and win the round. 

It may be difficult for certain folk to come up with this questioning and answering duality and could make some feel anxious about this.

As usual with this type of game, the right crowd makes the game.

Given the right crowd, this bumps up to a 7 for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game is highly dependent on the group.  

This is a lot like telestrations for me.

Don't play to win, but play to make a fun, silly, situation for the group.

If you play too close to the rules and end the round before things can develop, i feel you are missing the point.

RATING: 8.5
+ A beautiful combination of quick play, lots of interaction, and stressful deduction.
- A single terrible player can do a lot to dampen the enjoyment of this game.


Why it's previously-owned:
The web-based app for this game is good enough that we started just using that once players became familiar with the locations.  No need for the physical components at that point.
I have no idea where this one ended up.  I thought I still had it when I was negotiating a trade and ended up having to change the trade when I was unable to find it.

RATING: 8
Although this can be a stressful one, it's amazing how much it does with so few rules. We smashed this one out constantly for days over one holiday season and had a blast, developing an intricate meta. Well worth it for a party game crowd.

We chose to throw away 4-5 locations and use a sharpie to clothe the females in 4-5 other locations to make the game appropriate for our family. Wouldn't recommend the game as produced for ages under 21. The actual game is lots of fun for our family once modified.

RATING: 8
I can only hope that I have the chance to be a teacher, asking a student if they drink themselves to sleep each night due to the work, and then accusing them of being a spy when they don't know how to answer.
Gotta love cold war re-enactment.

Enjoyment greatly depends on how creative, risky, and loss-averse your group is.  Completely fell flat with one game group, as the questions were all safe and boring and lame, and the spy never stood a chance because no one asked any meaningful questions.  The poor spies had to ask a random question and generally outed themselves attempting to ask a meaningful question.

Played with a different group, one that roleplayed the roles on the cards, and it was a huge hit.  Spies had a chance, everyone had fun, and a lot of funny exchanges were had.

Also, could really, really, definitely use some printed player aids, to remove the need to pass around the rulebook.

I played this game just twice, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Maybe Spyfall simply wasn't the right game for me and my group, but I was expecting a much bigger potential for laughter, which I instead didn't find in this box. The game is not bad, but it works better as a deduction exercise than as a party activity.

ideal party game with a big group of non-gamers, however, has the chance of falling flat if group cannot come up with interesting or funny questions/answers. Found it to be best played after a few drinks. Also, having multiple places sheets would greatly improve the game, having just a single sheet slows things down and makes things obvious in certain cases.

Hugely group dependent.  If played with the right type group this game shines.  Requires open minded, creative people.  Easy for this game to fall flat with the wrong people.

I want to like this game. I have tried this with several different groups, but it is always met with confusion which transitions into indifference. Most of the time players don't know what questions to ask and spend too long staring at the locations page. I recently printed some helper cards (with sample questions and list of locations) to help get over its biggest hurdles and hope to give this game one last shot. [Update] I printed helper cards with all the locations on one side and sample questions on the other. This was a catalyst for getting people familiar with the dialog of the game and was enough to keep this game in my collection. Went from a 5 to a 7.

почитал правила. игра чисто на болтовню, как мафия: всем раздаётся по карте локации (и роли), шпиону - пустая. всем нужно вычислить шпиона, а ему - определить локацию. в коробке 30 разных локаций, и все друг другу по кругу задают произвольные осторожные вопросы.

RATING: 6
The trick, as everyone says, is to reveal just enough information that you know what the location is through both questions and answers, while trying to catch the spy out with your questions.  It is prone to breakdowns because those things are really difficult to do consistently well and because there will be times when players simply aren't on the same wavelength. Players are looking for the slightest hint that you don't know the location and when that happens it can be game over.  That is both the point of Spyfall and its weakness as a game.  Games can be tense and funny but as often they fizzle due to a clumsy question or a maladroit answer.

Fun little party game that went over better with our parents' than we thought it would. Game is fairly open which caused a little confusion when playing with non-gamers/very casual gamers who are used to more structure. You need to be somewhat vague with your questions and answers so as not to help the spy figure out where you are, yet need to be specific enough so that other players don't think you're the spy. Once everyone get a grasp on these, things went really well and everyone had a blast.

It's a pretty good time, and I like how the points are balanced for the tougher achievements in deduction, but like a lot of these games it will depend on the group's interactions.

I don't think that there's anything that separates this from games that I used to play when I was a kid.  Gaming has come a long way, and there are so many other party games out there that are better than this.  I could be talked into playing this again, but only if there aren't other party games that we could get everyone to play.  Some I'd suggest are One Night Ultimate Werewolf, Telestrations, and Codenames.

The venue was the beach. I'm not the spy and get asked: “Do you follow current affairs?” Took a moment for the penny to drop. In another round a player was asked if he liked a formal high tea in the afternoon, or preferred casual tea. The venue was the hospital. 
I played with the official version but prefer print and play versions that do not have pictures of the locations (because you should not refer to the pictures) and don't have job titles (because they are not relevant).

This game is very simple to play and understand. You only use 1 card per player in each round. There is always a spy (has the spy card) who doesn't know where they are, and must figure it out. The other players (have location cards) are trying to discover through questions who the spy is before time runs out or before the spy learns where they all are.
Very original, a must for "the resistance" fans.

RATING: 6.5
-Better with fewer people (5-6)? With 8+ players it didn't look fun.
-Tried it with 5 then 6 players and it was much better. The spy actually had a chance to discover the location and everyone else to find the spy. 
-Nobody likes being the spy. :)
-I think the digital version ha better functionality because observing the locations is much easier and less suspicious. Also you can cross off locations.
-Nice filler.

RATING: 7
Spyfall is one of the best party games I had the chance to enjoy: it is quick (8 minutes per round max), social and full of lying and deduction!

Each round players receive one card: every player except one has a card with a location (the same location for each player) and a role (relevant to that location: i.e. Hospital/surgeon); while one player receives a spy card, with no location.

So, what's all about: in turn, players start asking questions, with the goal to deduce who's the spy or, in case you're the spy, deduce what location everybody's in...

That's all. Fun guaranteed.

RATING: 6.5
Somehow this still yet to really take off in the regular gaming groups I play with. While the concept and the art is amazing, I guess this should really be played with the very vocal group rather than with a quiet crowd as they will be less likely to ask questions that are fun and less obvious to the spy.

Probably still need more plays before we can conclude what whether this would a good addition to the collection. A good point as of now is that it can play a greater number of players without being too laggy.

RATING: 5
To be fair I never ever got round to playing this game so its a bit mean to give it a 5 (or on the other hand it could be very generous) But I have given a 5 based on after reading the rules I was not inspired to play it as it just sounded daft and that we would always be asking the same questions. So it gets a 5 based on the lack of it inspiring me or our group to play it.

RATING: 3
Requires far too much thought for a party game. Coming up with questions and the bluffing is far too much like role play for my liking and I'm sorry I can't be arsed to learn all the locations to play effectively.

RATING: 8.5
An excellent party game. I wish there was a way to mitigate possibly having the spy be the same person 3-4 rounds in a row. One thing I ran into was having greedy non-spies. The person who calls the vote gets two points instead of one, so oftentimes, non-spies will not vote just so they can call the vote and grab the points.

RATING: 8
Initial Impression: For a game with so few components, I'm surprised at how much fun this is. I'm not normally a "party game" kinda guy but I have to admit enjoying this one. Granted, there are a number of uncomfortable situations, like what happens when the Spy is chosen to go first in the round, but in the end these lead to interesting sessions whose stories will be shared as in-jokes for years to come. The beauty of the game is in the simplicity of the rules, which can be taught to sometime in under a minute. The player interaction is what keeps the game fun and diverse. The quick playtime is just icing on the cake.

I absolutely LOVE some of the Dice Tower playthroughs of this game.  But in my experience, it slows down a lot more because the parameters are so open-ended for the questions.  It often devolves into waiting around while one person is thinking of a question.  I love the concept,and I really enjoy the feeling of trying to blend in, but with my groups it moves slower than I think it should.  I haven't tried A Fake Artist Goes to New York, or the new Chameleon, but I think they may scratch this itch even better.  All that being said, it is a fun game and I can tell can work amazingly well with the right group.

One of my regular Board Game Group's go to games.

Relatively light strategy makes Spyfall a fantastic wind down game at the end of the night. Each round goes for a max of 10 minutes, but may be shorter, and can be ended at any time, when people are ready to change games or leave. Inspires creative thinking, and often generates a lot of laughs.

2 things to note; 

1. It can be almost impossible when you are the spy and are asked the first question, our group is still trying to find a way around this.

2. Minimum 5 player game!!!
This just isn't fun with only 3 or 4 players.

The game reminds me of Werewolf, but with less work involved.

A quick to play social deduction game that is tense for both spy and everyone else.  Should come with a locataton card for everyone.  It is a shame this was not created with a more thematic aspect as you are never going to be in a situation where one person doesnt know the location and this lack of knowledge is a mystery.... Not a game I would want to play too often or too long but has a unique and satisfying feel that is going to be very funny with the right group.  Better if everyone knows each other but that is true of most party games.

Enjoy the game when needing something pretty quick. Games take about 15-20 minutes. Takes a game before a new player can really catch on. Perhaps too easy for the spy when playing with six or more. I think the number of locations may need to be increased with an expansion. The roles are a little confusing and it may be better to ignore. As it stands, the game can get stale after a while.

First Plays: Took me a while to realise that you are judged on the questions you ask as well as the answers that you give. Cheat sheets are essential to be able to see what the possible venues are and its a bit of a shocker that this isn't provided with the game. Another game that needs clever inventive players and will fail with less imaginative participants. Very quick 'just one more' filler.

My biggest complaint is as the spy, there are frequently times when you know for a fact that it is one of two places, but there is no way to discern which without absolutely giving it away.  (I.E. Theater or Movie Studio.)  Makes it less fun, but overall pretty good party game.

Spyfall has considerably fallen in ranking for me for the last couple of years. I think it's the people I play it with. The questions always seem to be the same, "How is the weather there?", "Do you think we are having fun here", etc. With a group of hardcore gamers, this works better, but not much better. I will keep this for a while longer and hope that it clicks with someone else or to the Trade pile it goes.

Boy oh boy, is this a blast. The entire game is only a conversation, but you don't feel like the game is overproduced. The fun artwork and variety of locations fuels the game so well, and provides an excellent backdrop for clever questions. Be too precise with an answer, and the spy will figure things out quickly. Be too vague, and you risk suspicion. Listening is so important for the spy. One side never seems more guaranteed to win. In our small sample of four games, the spy won twice. Brilliant deduction party game. Waiting for a few more plays, but this might be better than One Night Werewolf!

This game captures the tension of social deduction and amps it by 10 when you draw that card and see that you are the spy.

I adore a good social game, and this one is rock solid. It's such a simple concept, and it's brilliant. Everyone but the spy knows the location and is trying to figure out the spy, while the spy knows nothing and is trying to figure out where they are. And then it's just asking questions. Absolutely anyone can play and have fun with it. It's a much shallower social deduction experience than Resistance: Avalon or One Night Ultimate Werewolf, so I don't rate it as highly. But it gets points for being very quick and very entertaining and outshines those other games in terms of having absolutely zero barrier to entry.

RATING: 6
A clever twist on social deduction that just doesn't give one player information (the location) that is given to everyone else.  Can that player bluff their way to making everyone think he/she is part of the group?  And, can the group answer honestly without being too obvious so that the odd one out guesses where they are.  It's a fun, little, social game... nothing special.

--------------------------------------------------------
Quick Rules:
In Spyfall everyone is handed a card that either has a picture of a matching location or a spy on it. The goal of the spy is to figure out the location card everyone else got. The goal of everyone else is to figure out who the spy is, and vote them out. A timer is started and a predetermined start player (or whoever was last the spy) starts by choosing someone and asking them a yes or no question. Once answered the person asked then gets to ask a question to another player. You have to be careful what you ask to not give too much away but you still want people to know that you know what you are talking about. The same goes for the answer... and because everyone is trying to say not to much it allows a competent spy to bullshit their way through just long enough for the clock to run out. If something seems too fishy each person can call one and only one vote, stopping the clock and doing a majority rules vote on another player in the game. If the spy is caught the round ends, hurrah for the non-spies. If they are still loose, the clock starts up again and play continues. That's the gist of the game.
---------------------------------------------------------
I should start this by explaining that I really enjoy deduction games. I like to try to read people, and try to convince people that my intentions are totally what they appear to be, while being a dirty rotten traitor. That moment when you get to reveal that you've either bhamboozled someone, or that they have whamboozled you is just a great time. I really liked the idea of Spyfall. I kind of fell in love with the game before it even reached my hands. So when it fell from grace and boy did it ever fall, it was painful. Unfortunately it's demise was not in the game itself, but instead with the players. 

I've had trouble pushing new games to large groups. If the game is four players, everybody and their mom wants to play. Once it expands to eight, nobody wants to touch it. "It'll take to long." "But it's timed!" "I don't think I'll like it." "Play once to try it out." I quickly realized the only way to get this to the table was in one round run offs, with no use of the roles provided on the card. Either the spy won, or the spy gets caught and everyone else wins. Pretty heavily bias against the spy, but still a fun game, and when you do win as a spy the victory is that much sweeter.

The first game played of it with my group at the grange was a cluster f. I was so excited to actually get it to the table I didn't police the game well enough. After a few questions went by one of the players asked if the location contained an "O" to which like four of us said we wanted to start a vote. Mid vote the player flipped up his spy card and called out where we were... thinking he had won because he did it before the vote was actually completed. Now, that was a rough first play, but as things smoothed out the majority of plays after were actually really fun. Then came the really bad.

One night at an Angelo's game night we sat around and played Spyfall. Us, non spies were at the Zoo. When asked if this location was a good place for you to have sex, one of the players(The same guy from my The Game, Mafia de Cuba, and This Town Ain't Big Enough comments) looked at his card for awhile and said "Yea." Instantly almost every player tried to start a vote on him. The vote passed unanimously and the player flipped over his card to reveal the Zoo location. When I questioned why he possibly thought to answer yea to that he responded "Why do I have to answer logically?" Yea, why would you need to answer logically in a game totally predicated on you being able to answer questions to help your teammates identify you. I flipped my lid. We played again and I promised to answer illogically. I drew the spy card. When asked whatever someone asked me I responded "Apples" then turned to the player on my side and questioned "Bananas?" Nobody was the wiser and a few other people were too vague so I got away, not even playing a game, just sitting at a table taking up space and wasting air.

So, in recap, this game has the potential to be amazing, unfortunately in my plays, requiring a larger group actually hurt the game because you were just too likely to run into an absolute idiot. This game died a death that no game should ever have to suffer. Being drown not because it couldn't swim on it's own, but because a player was not able to swim and decided to grab onto it's leg and carry it to the depths with him. If you can keep it safe, maybe apply some floaties, it could be your go to party game. For me, we've long since had funeral services. 

-Tip for those still interested in playing this... If you can, print out a few copies of the middle of the rule book that has all the locations on it and leave the copies on the table while playing. Also, when you ask a question, hand the rule book open to that page to the person being asked the question. It gives the spy a fighting chance, because if you haven't played a lot you don't actually know what locations you should guess.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
In this 8 minute long party game, one card each from a random pack is given to each player. These packs contain 1 spy card, and the rest are all one identical location. Players then take turns asking each other questions about the location. The spy is trying to figure out what the location is, while everyone else is looking for the spy. The spy wins either if they can guess the location successfully, or if the group votes out someone who is not the spy, while the rest win if the spy is found out and voted out. 

Questions need to be just vague enough to not give the location away, but just specific enough to not bring suspicion to yourself. It can be confusing to play as the spy for the first time, but the games go so quickly that once that first time spy game is over you get back in and feel better about the game.

This is one of my favorite party or brief filler games.

Spyfall is far from being memorable but does its duty pretty well: it’s a light hidden roles game that plays in a handful of minutes and can be explained in an even shorter time. [i](July 2016)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - Great party game: to shine, Spyfall just needs a little home ruling and a cohesive group to play it with. This way awkward questions and references to previous plays or situations involving the group keep popping up, making the game a great engine for laughing and having fun.
Hence, in October 2017 I raised my rating from 6 to 8.

I was excited to try this one due to all the hype around it, but too be honest, I was expecting it to kind of fall short (similar to how Mysterium has a ton of hype, and I found it very average).  I was wrong though, this is a really fun party game.  The "fun" aspect of this one is very group dependent, but I really thought it was unique and interesting.  One I would like to break out more during more social type gatherings.

This was our go-to party game until codenames, but still great for a larger group. Simple fun premise that is easy to teach and is always a hit with new gamers. Downside for some is that creativity and imagination is required. Optimal with 6 players to keep track of everyone's answers while allowing the spy to hide a little more. Only downside is the game can suffer from theme-breaking questions that are oddly specific that rely on inside jokes or pop-culture references (I'm guilty of this). Mobility also makes this game very accessible.

This is probably the one social deduction game I'll play without having to be convinced. It's a ton of fun; not incredibly deep, but gameplay is hilarious. Even if you're stressed out by the notion of being the spy, rounds are short enough to where you'll be having fun again in no time.

Fun party game, very similar to Codenames. I prefer Codenames as the ability to really come up with a clever linkage and the satisfaction of a team 'getting it' I think outweighs coming up with the satisfaction of a clever question / answer here, but they are definitely party games of a similar flavor. Enjoyable, yet more brain-burning than you would think after hearing an explanation of how to play. Quick and fun.

Fantastic party game. I've found that people struggle to understand the game unless we play a very quick 'open hand' round where I give some examples of questions.

Once we get past that hurdle though this game is a blast!

...And absolutely terrifying when you peek at your card and it says SPY

RATING: 8.5
I have a lot of very extroverted Theatre friends. I started a game of this at a theatre party with only about 4, sort-of reluctant people, and it didnt leave the table for three hours. Soon we were rotating a dozen or so people into 8 person games of this. I bowed out after an hour to go play Smallworld, and they were still playing when I came back. This game is excellent. So so tense and so good, it is everything that it promises and more. Sometimes you'll play three rounds, and thats fine, it still feels exciting and satisfying, but this game can excite and inspire non-gamers like few other games. Just know that it is VERY group dependant, so I'm sure everyone's mileage will vary, but I think I will still be playing this years from now, even if its just every once and a while, when a group of us all want to test each others acting mettle and make each other sweat.

I am no fan of party games and this, although it is ... well ... creative, is no exception.

Stay in your role and every answer supports the impression of you being a spy. Don't stay in your role and focus on the pictures, well, then you might hesitate and create the impression that you are the spy.
Long story short: it's always a game of guessing and hoping.

Not my style...

Excellent party games for people not concerned with keeping scores that instead play for the experience. Requires players that are more loose than stiff in personality, and who won't become paralyzed when confronted with a tough situation (as when trying to come up with a clever answer or question that won't totally give away crucial information). The playing quality has a huge variance with tremendously hilarious peaks and awkward lows.

Now that we are playing with the role's on the cards it is a much better game. Make sure you read the rules so you don't get 20 games in and realize you are not supposed to discuss after an accusation. And you should become the character on your card so that it is more balanced for the spy. 

Watch this and you will be set:

Spyfall is just a plain old fun party game with a very simple premise.  Players are all dealt a card.  Almost everyone's card shows the same location (for example, a casino).  However, one player's card simply says "spy", so he has no idea he's hanging out at a casino.

Once the cards are dealt, players simply take turns asking someone a question.  For example, someone may ask "What kind of snack do you like to eat?".  A clever player may answer "chips" if they're in a casino, giving a subtle nod to the other players that he's not the spy.

The non-spies are all trying to figure out who the spy is, while the spy is trying to figure out where the heck he is while avoiding giving answers that might blow his cover.

Super simple game that results in a really good time!

RATING: 1
Horrible game, completely overrated and just did not make sense to me. Granted it was not taught well, but it's the kind of "game" that just does not do it for me, and teaching it differently / better would not have helped. Maybe a different group of people could have made a difference but it just does not work (for me) on any level.

It isn't an all out bad concept though, but it's so far from what I like I can not begin to fathom who might like it. Very heavy on deduction, and lateral thinking probably would go a long way but time limits (granted necessary) and non-structured flow (also somewhat of a per-requisit here) make this a chore. Bang the Dice Game and Coup do the same sorts of thing, but have a game in there, which here is just asking questions.

RATING: 6.6
Party games can be great gateway games. Unfortunately, to play this one well requires a awareness of the 30 location options, which is overwhelming. Also, the questions and answers players fabricate are so restricted that they choke the life out of the game. I can understand why this game is so popular; it just didn't impress me.

RATING: 6
I like social deduction games, but this one just felt too confining. People can pick up on even extremely subtle references, so to play effectively, players have to keep their comments super-bland.

RATING: 7
Time the rounds - makes bad rounds bearable

Keep score - sucky spies feel better (only lose a point a two), and good spies will prolong the game and throw suspicion on other players. Gets rid of the "I'm always the spy" feeling.

RATING: 8
Always a hilarious time. Some of the most awkward conversations imaginable happen during the course of this game.

I have played it with gamers, regular friends, and my family (including my parents, who loved it). Yet to play it without people constantly asking for another game, then another, then another, then another...

It's amazing how many laughs you get JUST out of people answering questions in absurdly vague ways.

There is an immense pressure for the spy here which can be daunting for some people. But you can actually get a lot of deduction out of the game as your group plays enough to start getting the hang of questioning - it's one of our big "crossover" hits for our split of social-first and strategy-first players.

One thing though: this game's theme does not even remotely make sense to me. Like, why doesn't the spy know their own location? I DON'T UNDERSTAND. In the end, it doesn't really matter because it's so bizarre that it goes right back around into being funny.

But if you are at all a fan of silly roleplaying party games, you owe it to yourself to check this game out.

Update: I played this with my cousin and the ENTIRE game he phrased all of his questions/answers around other specific locations in the deck - like "have you seen the monkeys?" in a university, making talking to him effectively useless. It was the most bizarre tactic I have ever seen, and it was incredibly, [i]incredibly[/i] funny.

Not bad but don't really love the dynamic of one bluffer and several deducers. From a metagame standpoint, as the deducer you have to give answers that are sufficiently vague so when you are the bluffer it is believable. I guess I am missing any subtlety in strategy in these games.

Cool game/activity of creativity and fun. The group you play with will really dictate how the game will be perceived. Good way to fill the time and provoke fun engaging questions. Most of the time the questions are repetitive but it still gets some good laughs. I wish there was a picture booklet of locations to pass around to everyone at the table, it would make it much easier to look non-conspicuous.

RATING: 8
Rated 8 after one play... but with some key asterisks and reservations!

This is a very interesting party game where all players but one know a secret location, and players bounce around questions to try to root out the spy. With just that basic premise, Spyfall strikes me as a very lean and dynamic hidden role game.

The key asterisk is that it is [i]very[/i] tough to be the spy for new players. This game simply won't work with some people, and because it likely needs a larger group, the chance that you have a group of people with equal "social party savviness" might be too slim to get to the table for everyone's enjoyment.

I don't know how significant that last point is, so I'll try to get it to the table a few more times and see how it goes.

I'm not much of a party game guy, so take my review with a grain of salt. But I just found the game way too light for my tastes. Sure, it's easy to pick up and play, but there's hardly any depth and so I can't figure out WHY I'd want to play. It's basically just a glorified guessing game.

Super hot party game--everyone gets a card with a location, but one person gets a card that says "spy"--game is to figure out who got the spy card by asking vague questions of others about the location.

This is the social deduction game I've been looking for... almost.    
Spyfall = The Resistance + Dixit.  Resitance was rubbish - random smack talk and blind guessing to open the "game".  Dixit is solid, but the super artwork was also super subjective.  Spyfall brings those ingredients together and makes an actual GAME of it all.  4 players gives each player multiple questions.  8 player is way more of a party style game and leaves more room for doubt IMHO.
The worst part of this game is also the best part = asking the questions.  For some players, the ability to ask meaningful, non-obvious questions is super elusive.  Not just group dependent, but individual-players-within-said-group dependent.

Is this a game or a social experiment in Madness? After
each round we were either ROFLOL or ranting at each other
in high pitched voices. If anybody had eavesdropped on our session they would most certainly have called up the
local Asylum and requested assistance to lock us all up.

This is a streamlined Version of "Linq" which must be tried once in a lifetime. If you think the spy has it tough you`re in for some surprises. Trying to be as diffuse as possible in questioning and answering is way
harder than it sounds like. Some people won`t be able to
handle the flood of creative energy required to be good
at this game. But that`s OK , because it`s more of an
experience than a game. Go with the flow and have a laugh
at other players reactions to situations that occur.

There's not a lot to this game, but I really appreciate the value in an 8p game that can be over in 15 min or less.

All players have to do is ask each other loaded questions to sniff out the spy, while the spy listens to those questions as clues to figure out the secret location.

One spy. The rest are agents. Can you figure out who the spy is by just asking questions about your location? Or can the spy figure out your location first? My favorite social deduction game by far.

This game was terrible the first time I played it.  I gave it another chance by printing out 8 cheatsheets for people to have in hand for additional prompting and less obvious spy glancing.  It was much better and the game should come with them premade due to how important they were.

Components: Simple components. Although redundant, I like that there is a Spy card for each location, so it doesn't become more worn than the other cards. The Spy card could be improved by having additional information on it, e.g., that causes a player to rotate it to read/look at, the same way the location cards cause other players to orient them correctly to read.

Experience: As a spy, I like this much more than being the mafia/werewolf/traitor in other games, because I don't think there is overt lying, so it feels like less of a sham. The spy has more to do than just hide: they should also be actively listening to either deduce the location, or at least get close enough to improve their ability to bluff. Still, very stressful as a spy.

As a non-spy, it's fascinating, to try to give informative but vague answers; to ask informative and revealing questions. The roles on the cards really enhance this process, as it gives us something specific to imagine as we answer questions.

There are too many locations at first for the spy to be able to remember them all. I'd recommend beginning with a subset of the possible locations, and only adding more as players are familiar with them.

Its weird. It's a party game, but it doesn't bring everyone to talk to everyone. Instead it devolves into a "Awkward blind date" game, were you take 30 silent awkward seconds to think of a question... and the other one takes 30 awkward silent seconds to answer.

But somehow it works and is great fun!

I think this game requires the right group to make it feel really fun.  Over analytical types may un-fun the game somewhat.  You sorta need clever types, who can think of vague questions to ask on the spot.  I found this game to be OK so far.  I am hoping with further plays that my feelings will improve.  So far I am a little disappointed with the FUN factor in this game.

Another really group dependent social games, your group needs to be willing to slip into role play for this to work. Play the optional roles at the bottom of the card, they give the spy more room to bluff and generally create hilarious occasions. Don't bother with scoring.

On vous offre l'opportunité de vous mettre dans la peau d'un espion sur le point de perdre sa couverture ou dans la peau d'un Agent spécial qui est sur ses talons. L'espion tente de découvrir le lieu de sa mission tandis que les Agents tentent de le démasquer sans lui dévoiler leur localisation. Bluff, déduction.

I played this for the first time at the Stonemaier Design Day. First I don't understand why the Spy has to figure out where everyone is. A spy would know where everyone is. So it misses on that for me. The real reason I'm not a big fan of it is that I'm not good with forming questions in a quick amount of time.

We played with 8 people and were using 10 minute rounds and people kept thinking I was the spy because I couldn't think of good questions after a lot of questions had been asked. It's not that I didn't laugh and have a good time while playing it, but I didn't enjoy the game itself.

RATING: 4
Played a print and play so I can't comment on the retail components but at first glance it appears really difficult to play the spy since you might not have enough information to go on when describing the location everyone else is in. If you like to bumble your way into a location then it might work.

Definitely play with both the roles and the locations or it won't give people enough material to answer the random questions with.

The game might be better if you actually ignore the art on the cards and make up answers to give the spy a better chance to fake his/her way through questions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Outstanding game. I try to encourage players to ignore the card art, and let their imagination of a location steer the questions. Such a simple concept for a game. Your entertainment and enjoyment will rely entirely upon your groups involvement and investment in the process. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The game is interesting for sure but can really fall flat when people simply struggle to come up with questions to ask. Also, this is a secret identity game where being the "bad guy" feels reeeeeaaally nerve-wracking which some people won't like.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Very good game, but it kind of suffers from a few things:
First of all, experience matters. Not only because you know how to ask seemingly irrelvant questions better but mostly because you know the locations/roles better.
Also, you need the right group for it, since some people really seem to hate the stress of being the spy... and the game only really shines if you play the role you're given in character in my opinion.

That said, it's still a very fun game that is extremely easy to play and teach - and the online versions of it are even better since you don't have to look at the location list if you're the spy but can casually just glimpse at you mobile. I'm probably underrating this game since it's that easy to play with people you don't know but I rarely game outside of my gaming group.

[November 2016 - 7.2]
Another fun party game that allows for higher group numbers. The spy needs to be a pretty good player in order for the game to be good though... otherwise he/she is rooted out pretty quickly. There's also a tendency for the game to get repetitive with the same questions being asked game to to game. "Are we inside or outside?" "What are you wearing?" Although there are plenty of moments when you marvel at people's ability to be vague yet precise in confirming that they are not the spy.

A fun game for people who like social bluffing games.  My best variation:  Instead of asking a question you may point to someone and they must do an action (charade) for the location.  I know this sounds difficult but it works very well, livens the game flow, and it's easier than it sounds.

Another great bluffing game. In this one, everyone in the game has a card telling them what location they are in... everyone but the spy that is! People must talk to try and suss out who the spy is before he can figure out what location they are in. A ton of fun as people balance sharing info and holding back. Don't think too hard about the logic of the theme. This was the other killer game of 2015 (along with Codenames).

Really fun game, especially if playing with witty/creative people.

Coming up with "safe/hint" questions is ideal, however, it can cause some players to get "analysis-paralysis" in search of that "perfect" question, leading to slow gameplay.

Being the Spy is actually very stressful.  A poker-face and being able to discretely fake/lie is critical.

Definitely need to have all the locations in clear view for everyone to get familiar with, which is the only real downside when playing the first few times.

This game is great fun with the right people. I love this game but... I insist on playing with a group that can be pretty witty and ask questions that go beyond the basics. That being said, in this game everyone is in a known location (except for the spy) and you go around the table asking people questions to determine who the spy is (ie: who doesn't know where we are?). Quick, hilarious, and fun... one of my highly recommended party games. The other great thing about this game... works great for road trips, etc. as you can play this game by just looking at your location card really quick (once you are familiar with most of the possible locations).

I am disappointed with Spyfall.  I had such high hopes but the end result was just not that interesting.  There were only four of us so perhaps that was a problem in that the spy was pretty obvious at all times.   The pressure of trying not to appear as if you are looking at the occupations as a spy was also difficult.

Perhaps with many more plays one would get into the swing of the process and the available occupations, but I'm not prepared to try given that vast number of less stressful and more entertaining party games abound.

A miss and quickly sold on.

Amazing party, social deduction game. Probably my favorite of that kind. Players are dealt one card each and every card gives you the name of a location and a role except one that only says "You are a Spy!". So a Spy doesn't know what is the location and other players don't have a clue who the Spy is. Now the game flows with one player asking any question to another player who must answer it and then ask someone else in return. Both questions and answers will give players insight about who is a Spy and who isn't. Simple and yet amazingly fun.
In the beginning there is a problem of remembering all the possible locations which makes it much easier to tell a Spy, but it could be solved by making reference sheet for each player.
[b]Update:[/b] Dropped to 8.5 from 9.3 after reaching exhaustion point. No more questions to ask. Depends on the gaming group.

interesting twist on the who's in on the secret game. Not really jived with a game of it yet. If some players know the locations really well and others do not things can get a little one sided. A game really suited to repeat play by a group of friends.

It's just not for me.  I don't like playing the spy.  The combination of lying to everyone, being the outsider, not knowing or having all the locations memorized makes it difficult to lie and I happened to play the spy 2 out of my first 3 games.

I'm surprised at the ridiculously high ratings this thing is getting.  As a game, it fails.  As a party game, it also fails.  It is a dark day for a game when I would choose Cards Against Humanity over it, but in the end, I do.

As far as party games go where deduction is the lynch pin of the whole shindig, there are much better ones out there that you can play that are even easier to set up and play.

If you absolutely must play this game, make your own copy.  This isn't worth the stock its printed on.

Spyfall is a social deduction game where for once it's actually not fun to be the secret bad guy/spy/cylon. In fact, it's quite stressful. You simply ask questions to gather information. If your questions are too vague, people will think you're a spy and the more specific your questions related to the location, the more likely it is the spy will find out where they are. I have a few problems with the game. First, this is way more convenient as a web-app than as a game. Second, it's so hard for a spy to narrow down a location out of a possible 30. Maybe it would work better in two sets of 15 location. This would reduce the possible places, making the spy have an easier time. Finally, this is more of an activity than a game. Is it fun? Yeah, but I can find a game that's fun and also more of a game than an activity. Yes! Dixit for example.

RATING: 2
The theme of Spyfall makes literally no sense, but that's supposedly part of the fun. In reality, this obtuse concept creates surprisingly awkward situations, which conflicts with its party-game audience. Granted if watching your friends struggle to ask thoughtful questions, and provide strange answers, then you might like Spyfall, but its novelty never clicked with me.

RATING: 7
Fun game. Some small issues with the answers being too open ended but that will likely improve as my group gets more familiar. Also very tough for the Spy when everyone is new to the game. I need to print out a bunch of location sheets.

Seems like it would be more fun if everyone was always super quick-thinking and witty. The design seems to be based on the players being unreasonably clever. Seems like with repeat plays people might get their heads wrapped around the way to ask and answer questions better but on first impressions it fell kind of flat.

Social deduction game - 8 minutes for a round!  Best with 5-7 players.
Reminds me of "Fake Artist Went to New York" in that you're trying to give others enough info to make them realize you know the location, without giving it away to the Spy.

Free webapps to use: [thread=1528800]link[/thread]
Android app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hfd.spyfallsms

Mid-game: 
- Spy wins if he reveals himself and correctly identifies location
- Players win if someone stops game temporarily to accuse Spy and gets a unanimous vote (one such accusation allowed per player per round)
End-game
- Spy wins if wrong player gets unanimous vote, or if there's no unanimous vote after everyone has had chance to make accusation
- Players win if someone makes accusation for Spy and gets unanimous vote
 
Voting rules in original printing were confusing, has been clarified, eg see revised voting rule for end-of-round vote:
https://boardgamegeek.com/article/19440323#19440323
Or:
https://boardgamegeek.com/article/17720729#17720729

Original rules:
- Dealer points at a player he accuses, then next player points at player he accuses, etc; Spy only loses if all other players accuse him unanimously.  But actually this is probably just misunderstanding of the original rule, the intent seems to have been all along as it is in revised rules.

New Cryptozoic rules:
- Dealer accuses another player and there's a vote by all players
- if not unanimous, then next player in clockwise order accuses a player and there's another vote by all players
You go around the table thus until you get a unanimous vote (or not).

German rules: 
- You just go once around the table, and have a single majority vote, convicting the player with the majority of votes (presumably ties are a win for the spy)

Roles: not for first-timers, generally they make the game harder for non-spies (and easier for the Spy).
Low player numbers: are harder for spy, but roles make it easier
High player numbers: are easier for spy, and roles make it even easier still (and harder for non-spies)

Spyfall is some good silliness. Only one person gets a blank card while the others get a card with a location on it. Each turn one person asks another person a question about the location to see if they're with the group (know the location) or they're the spy (don't know what the location is). You play for 8 minutes, and the "location" people don't want the spy to know what the location is so questions and answers must be vague. The spy is trying to deduce the location before time is up. This duality forces a type of thinking I find unique among hidden role games. 

Before we started I used the example of not being obvious and saying: "Arr, do yee get lots of boo-tee at this location?" because the spy would immediately know you're on a pirate ship. First location we got? Pirate ship. Caitlin kept losing her sh*t as a result and we all were giggly. Then Alyssa inadvertently asked Brian: "Arrrrr, you..." and we all lost it. Good times!

Real fun game. If you are the spy, it's all about trying to have a clue of the location early enough to say something that make sense according to the location. If you are not a spy, it's all about saying enough, but not too much. All this creates a lot of giggling and strange answers/formulations. Minus point for not having an overview card to each player with all the locations. I have made my own, but it should have been included in the box.

I don't know how to rate this, honestly. 

I love the experience, and I want to play it a lot. It's a great party game.

BUT the scoring is wonky. The way the game is designed ensures that there's no way to ensure that everyone has an even chance at victory.

That said, it's a party game. Like many party games, there is a recommended length of 5 rounds. Of course, if it's like any other party game, in reality, people will play until they get tired of it. In such a situation, I think the issues with the scoring would even out some, but then it's another party game that never ends and nobody ever wins.

I'd love to see a variant with scoring that makes a bit more sense.

Interesting concept however this 'game' is just far too open-ended for me. 

It is very difficult to come up with vague questions and answers and to be honest its quite tedious. There is a lot of downtime as players um and ahh over what question they can ask without revealing too much.

Dedukciós, party játék, ahol azért meg is kell nyilvánulni valamennyire. Annyira nem kell produkálni magad, mint egy activityben, de kb. Dixit szinten igen. Szóval teljesen befordulósoknak nem ajánlott. A játék maga csak keretet ad, de leginkább a társaságon múlik, hogy hogy sül el a dolog a végén. Az egy kicsit talán probléma, hogy egyedül az ügynöknek kell nézegetni az összefoglalókártyát, de talán áthidalható a lapok összefogásával ez a dolog.
Jó ötlet, jó társasággal nagyszerű szórakozás.

Spyfall is a pretty silly social deduction game. I can see it work well in theory but you either need a group that is purely out for laughs or one that is quite familiar with the possible locations. Requiring that kind of familiarity in a party game is a bit unfortunate. It didn't work all that well in practice for that reason.

Pretty much everyone I've introduced this to has enjoyed it. I like the overall feel of repeated games since you're not going to be a spy most of the time which is relaxing. Once in a while though, you'll be the spy which wakes you up again.

Unfortunately, I think that the online version is vastly superior to the physical game. It doesn't require any setup in the middle of repeated games, doesn't require any table space at all, and probably seems much less intimidating to non gamers. The physical version doesn't even have a location reference sheet for every player.

Well, at least the physical game doesn't drain your phone battery and doesn't require an Internet connection.

RATING: 7.191
Still not sure about this game.  It sort of works, yet I'm strangely unclear if I actually like it.  The difficulty of being the spy when you don't know the locations that well makes it more an exercise of trying to glimpse the locations without being caught.  Definitely requires the pimping of individual location sheets for each player (they really should have been included) to work properly.  And yet, it is a game with a unique mechanism, so that is one reason to keep it (rating 7.143, Aug 16).  UPDATE: I really do like the concept of this game, but it typically seems to be more stress than fun at the end, and I don't think people enjoy it as much as the promised concept implies.  This is especially true after a game of Fake Artist Goes to New Yoork, which is a visual version of Spyfall, and I would say more socially enjoyable.  Would only play with maybe serious gamers intend on a cold war spy scenario.  That said, have not done the full roleplay option, which might open up the game to more confusion and dynamics, so still worth another try (Rating 6.642, Feb 17). UPDATE: Actually, with less cynic gamers and newbies, this can be a fun game (Rating 7.191, Nov 17)

Very polarizing game. I enjoy it as not the spy

However I have some big hang ups with it. The components for 1 suck because there is no player aid for the locations so you have to setup convoluted rules so that the spy isn't outed when they are looking at the location list. 2nd it's really hard to answer a question if you are the spy and get asked first. I don't think there is any way to get around that but these aspects put a lot of stress on the spy. It's a totally different experience

Also the scoring part sucks, never use it

I played this game one evening with 8, 5 and 4 players. It is definitely good fun and gets funnier as you get familiar with the locations and the type of questions to ask. Role playing is critical to be fun and it is worth stepping back a minute during the game and listen to the discussion because it is quite offbeat and hilarious. I can see this game lacking some replayability after a while, but it is the same with any light party game I guess.

After one play. Fun, but feels a little broken--it's really hard to be the spy, because many people provide tells that they're not a spy (looking at their cards, overconfident, etc.), and so it's easy to pin down the person who is kind of lost. Would need several games to balance out the tells and strategy.

First play was a bit of a dud. Younger kids didn't quite get it.

RATING: 6
Probably the best bluffing/social deduction game I've played with 4 or 5. I think that how much people like this game is pretty dependent on the metagame their group has though. Mine is good, with people trying to quickly hint that they know the location as opposed to staying mum to not alert the spy. This ends up having people only getting asked 2 questions at most before someone is fingered for a spy. This quick round time makes it a winner. 

edit: down to a 6. I think I'd rather just play onuw every single time if I have the numbers. But, like I said, this is better for 4, and probably 5 too.

An instant hit!  We'll see how it endures over 100 plays, but so far making up questions and putting the spy on the spot was just hilarious!  If you have some creative people or actors - forget it - you'll have a blast!  But all that's needed for this game is a good imagination!

This is a game that depending on your group with soar like an eagle or go over like a ton of bricks. Your group has to be willing to socialize, because this game is a very social.

I generally dislike social role-deduction games and "creativity" games like Dixit, but this combination of them gets my rapt attention when I play. The key is forbidding politicking-- if someone makes an accusation, either there's instant consensus or the game continues. No "didn't you notice how long she paused?" or any garbage like that.

Playing on phones is actually better than the printed version (that way everybody has a location list right in front of them) but the printed copy is easier to wrangle.

RATING: 6
Hidden role/social deduction games are among my favourites and so, excited by the hype and rave reviews, I pre-ordered Spyfall and waited impatiently.  

And when finally my trembling hands peeled the plastic and shook the box open?  Wow!  Nice artwork, attractive theming, a core mechanic that can be explained in one minute contained in a reductionist rule set which allows for players to create their own fun.  

Could this be 'the one'? The game that will convince my friends to abandon the pubs on a Friday night?  The game that will persuade my sons to abandon the X-box? The gateway game that will have everyone begging for more? 

After 12 sessions I have to admit, I'm underwhelmed.  Ok, the production could have been better, especially with regards to the lack of reference sheets for each player- a glaring omission in my view, and there is no real game here- the scoring system is sadly underdeveloped.   But that's not it.  No, the simple truth is that the experience which we enjoyed in our first few sessions could not be sustained.  And no amount of expansions will change that.  

While we were all inexperienced we had some laughs.  But now we find ourselves following repetitve patterns of thinking.  Introducing new players into the mix doesn't solve the 'group think' problem; by the time the newbies have understood the subtleties involved in questioning and answering everyone else has lost interest.  And it just doesn't play well with 7 or 8.

From virgin kiss to failed marriage in the blink of an eye.  I was destined to be disappointed, wasn't I?

Was more fun to me when we played with "Party Quirks" rules from Whose Line Is It Anyway- the spy would need to guess the location and then the game would keep going until they also guessed the roles too. We'd still out the spy when we knew to force them to guess, then slowly get more and more obvious until they were right.

i finally played as the spy! I was a total mess despite feeling like i am quite good and telling elaborate fabricated stories - in the situation the game creates you feel completely unprepared. Even in my situation when a player gave away quite a lot with a question and i had narrowed the location to a hotel or restaurant i still found my myself completely filled with paranoia, uncertainty and guilt when another player asked "where do you go after this?"...I nervously answered..."home"...i cracked and everyone knew. you really haven't played until you've been the spy.

RATING: 4
Interesting game concept, and the answers people give can be entertaining. But, most of the places have the problem that the answer to the question can vary significantly depending on the player's role or interpretation of the question in the context of the location. In the games played so far, this has been enough of a confusion that it detracts from enjoying the game.

This is a very clever and enjoyable party game. Essentially, one of the players (the spy) is secretly trying to pretend like they know something that all of other players actually DO know. For most of the players, this game is a relaxing investigation of the other players, trying to figure out who the spy is without giving away to much information to said person. But for the spy, this is a tense game of quick-thinking and purposefully vague statements that demands a complete top-of-mind knowledge of each of the dozens of locations. That is close to impossible for a first-time player, but as the players become more and more familiar, the game gets better and better. Regardless, it is still undeniably more difficult to be the spy, yet that makes those occasional victories all the more satisfying.

This might actually be my favorite social deduction game yet -- this game inverts social deduction games by encouraging players to spout out half-truths, diversionary comments, and intentionally obtuse answers. 

The premise is simple, one player is the spy and is actively listening in on conversations from other players trying to figure out where they've landed (which they don't know since they're in a box or something). Players take turns asking each other questions: most players to figure out who the spy is, the spy to figure out the location. Everyone skirts around giving away too much information -- but at some point (~8 minutes), an accusation still has to be made (or the spy has to pre-empt the accusations by making a not-so-wild guess).

It doesn't really matter who has won, because the question and answer period is often uproarious: incredibly zany yet inane questions are answered with similarly situated responses.

Only qualm is that it would have been nice to have included a cheat sheet with all the locations for each and every player.

It's good, though it might be a bit too slow for some i suppose. When players have to come up with a clever question, sometimes it takes them up to a minute before they got one. So although it's great fun, it's not uncommen to see people start checking their phones..

I could imagine this to be better with just 3-5 players. But incredible clever design nonetheless.

Also this gets better, the more you know your playing partners. So you can better judge if someone just thinks differently or is actually the spy.

Okay, this is Burkean Parlor: The Game--it simulates coming into a conversation and trying to figure out what everyone is talking about. This is a brilliant idea, and I definitely expect to see the game used to teach composition in the future.  As a game--I really like it. It's DIFFICULT to think of the best questions to ask and the right ways to answer. If this is a party game, it's the thinkiest I've ever played.  One might call it a social deduction game, but I generally dislike that sort of game and really like this one, because it's not about teams and treachery in the same way that most of them are.

A great little time filler. One of your friends is the spy and has no idea where they are. While they try and find out the rest of you are trying to uncover them by asking questions. Trying to trick the spy into giving themselves away with an answer that exposes them without giving away too much information. Lots of tension and humour and each round plays in less than 8 minutes, a real winner for an ice breaker or party game.

Spyfall makes for a madly amusing party game filled with tension, so long as you play it enough to get past the initial faults that arise for the spy when they're not familiar with the locations.

After enjoying One Night Werewolf, it only took a description of Spyfall for me to like it. I like trying to ferret out one player at the table. However, the 8 minutes felt quite short, and the lack of rules to keep people talking seemed to hurt as well. Perhaps a timer of 20-30 seconds to ask a question before you're forced to draw a pre-written one from a deck? That way, if you don't think quick enough, odds are the pre-written question will give away more info than you hoped. The spy seemed at a huge disadvantage, but I never got to try it, and our group played about 5 rounds to end a night, so there wasn't a ton of time to figure out strategies. But I definitely want to play it again.

Bokkensprong Beveren 9/10/2015. Elke speler krijgt een kaart; één die van de spion en de overigen die van een locatie (iedereen dezelfde). Een speler stelt een vraag aan een andere speler; na het antwoord mag deze zelf een vraag stellen aan een derde, etc. Doel: spion vinden door unaniem stemmen; voor de spion is het doel om de locatie te raden. Vragen stellen en antwoorden is niet zo makkelijk als het lijkt. Leuk, kort spelletje. Nadeel: locaties zijn in het Engels.

Maybe I'm just bad at being the spy, but it seems to me that being the spy is too swingy. You might get asked the first or second question, or you might get overlooked for a while. A bit too free-form for me, the same reason I suspect I'll dislike Dixit.

SO much fun.  Funniest game I own.  First few games can be tricky because players don't know the locations that well - I recommend printing 8 card sized reference lists so everybody can look at them relatively inconspicuously.  Nearly as good as Codenames.  This is slightly more amorphous so some people struggle with it.

RATING: 9
Spyfall is an easy game to teach, but it has a surprisingly steep mastery curve for a party game (especially learning how to be a spy). This is a bit of a turn-off for some players.

Fortunately, the process of crafting questions and responses that confirm knowledge without giving too much away is fun even for new players. And it's enough to keep the game interesting until one's group starts being filled with masterful spies - that's when the game can really produce some clever, surprising moments of trickery. It's a game that I've grown to enjoy more and more and never tire of - it is easily my favorite party game of all-time.

This is a really good icebreaker game, or like the appetizer to some other game being the main course at your game night.  It is simple to explain and plays very fast.  It goes by so quickly that it's hard to imagine any big tensions or conflict bursting out.  I don't think you'd want to play it for more than 45 mins to 1 hour in one sitting, which is like 3-5 rounds.  

I would recommend printing out the smaller version of the middle insert that is included as one of the "Files" here on BGG, and giving one to each player.  This effectively fixes the big strategic bug of the game, which is that the spy and only the spy has reason to be looking at the insert, so it's much less conspicuous if everyone has one in front of them.

My go-to gateway social deduction game!  So easy to teach the rules and get the group to start thinking creatively about what to ask and how to answer.

It definitely takes a round or two to get players to understand this one. After everyone gets into the feel for it, it gets great! Every round has a perfect moment when it's either really obvious who the spy is or the spy figures out the location, and the round just ends in laughter. Throw out the scoring and just play a few rounds until everyone is ready to move on.

WOW, what a game, it really surprised me. You can explain it under 2 minutes and most games can finish under 10 mutes but it is fascinating and fun to play. I feel the game is a lot deeper than I initially though and it reward creativity from the players. Also love the bluffing needed by the spy to win the game.

As this moment, I can´t think of a negative thing for the game.

Bottom line, Spyfall is the one of the best party games I have ever played and it is a must buy for me. I want to play it again soon.

After more plays, I can think of a negative for the game. It is VERY group dependent. I have had some games that crashed and burned, still I consider it a great game. I just realized they will release an expansion, it is a must buy for me as well. I hope they include the promo cards that are really expensive at this point.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.75
Fun challenging (and sometimes tense) party game. Becomes more strategic after many plays, the trick becomes giving deliberate correct answers that fit multiple places to throw the spy off - can be very challenging to do so and often players need to think carefully about their questions and answers. The role of the spy gets harder and harder the fewer number of players there are. After repeated plays questions asked can get repetitive (i.e., what time did you get up?, what did you eat?, what did you do today?, etc.) so its really best as a "filler" game to be played two or three times between other games - but really great fun for what it is.

Spyfall is a fun hidden role game, that only gets better the more you play and get familiar with the locations. At the same time, I think you'll definitely reach a saturation point, and it will eventually need to have some expansions to extend the playability. You also need to play with people who are creative on their feet. Coming up with questions reminds me little of being the judge in Dixit.

RATING: 7
After the rules explanation I understood nothing. Where's the game, there must be something more? The astonishing thing is that the game actually worked. And it's fun.

Gameplay: One location is randomly chosen. Each player gets one role for this location. One of the players gets the spy card which is the only card not showing the location. Then, one player starts to question another player something about the location. The question should be specific enough to discover the spy but unspecific enough to not give away the location. If the spy doesn't win by revealing himself before time runs out and correctly guesses the location, all players jointly get one guess as to who is the spy. If they are correct, they win. If not the spy wins.

An interesting example of a game that has become irrelevant because of the amount of time it has taken to come to market as well as an excellent online implementation that makes the original version seem clunky.

Ordinarily I always want to have the physical copy, but this is one where I would always choose to play online.

This was a great idea for a game. It seems like groups can get into a rut and always play a certain way. But this game has provided so many laughs and fun moments that it should definitely be deemed a classic.

2016-03-27 - 8 - Great party game! I played once with 5 players and it should be even better with more (I would not try 4 or less though). Keep in mind that it's pretty crowd dependent and you need to feel really comfortable with others to make this game shine. I think I never had more laughs in any other game.

2016-11-06 - 8->7 - Very group dependant and also mood dependant. Sometimes it will just not work as good as you would expect, but if it does it might be the funniest party game there is. But because of that uncertainity I rank it lower.

RATING: 9
Such a fantastic deduction game!  The game consists of a ton of small decks.  One is selected at random and everyone is dealt a card.  The cards all represent a location.  Everyone has the same location except for one player who gets the spy card.  The spy has no idea what the location is.  Players then ask questions to one another trying to be vague enough to not let the spy learn what the location is.  The asker and answerer do want to try to give enough of an answer to help reveal that they do know what location they are in, so the table then trusts them.  The spy just has to try to deduce where they are and bluff their way through the round.  Such a fun party deduction game.  A huge hit in our group.

I'm not usually a big party game fan, but I find both this and Codenames fun to play when the group is large or non-gamery. This is a less thinky than Codenames and offers more laugh-out-loud moments. It's hard to say which game would work better for your party group, but if you give this a try be sure to print out some location player aids first.

Group deduction games are popular lately and this one has a lot of potential. My biggest gripe is that it's often too hard for some people to come up with the kind of questions necessary to really deduce who the spy is and who isn't and it can often feel to difficult when playing as the spy.

As far as social deduction games go, this is probably my favorite.  Really accessible and really fun. However, the success of the game session is entirely dependent on the group's ability to ask creative questions.

This is a game that definitely requires you to have the right sort of group to play with. The rules are simple and it's easy enough to play, however, some people just don't "get it" and aren't able to ad-lib that easily. As a result in my group, ​it's fallen flat.

I'm not a fan of social deduction games and that certainly factors into my rating.  This one is worse than most though because it's very stressful as the spy trying to come up with reasonable responses/comments.  I don't want to play this again.

After all the hype from online we picked up a copy at Origins 2015. Finally got a chance to play it and it was a lot harder than expected. Had a difficult time coming up with questions to ask. I enjoyed it, but I'm going to need a little more time with it to be able to give it a rating.

Sokkal jobb, mint amire számítottam, nagyon szórakoztató, de ugyanakkor gondolkodtató is, kimondottan nehéz jó kérdést feltenni és úgy válaszolni, hogy azzal a saját ügyünket vigyük előre. Jelentősen változik a játékérzet a különböző játékosszámnál, minél kevesebben játszanak, annál nehezebb a titkosügynök dolga. Kellemes meglepetés volt.

[size=12][b]Why I like Spyfall:[/b][/size]
+ I like how this game requires less deduction for a deduction game. The spy often reveals their identity or they figure out the location as a result of the carelessness of another player. The "guess what card they have" mechanic is hence a non-issue. 
+ The game features high replayability with all of the different locations (especially in my P&P edition).
+ The game is easy to teach.
+ The game is short.
+ The game requires meaningful decisions to win. You often have to be careful about what you say or you might lose. I would argue that Spyfall has meaningful decisions compared to games like Telestrations because there is a clear distinction between who wins and loses, and you have a role in whether or not this happens. The scoring is irrelevant in this regard.

[size=12][b]Fixable dislikes in regards to Spyfall:[/b][/size]
/ I did not like how the players did not have a player aid listing all of the locations. I also did not like a few of the locations, a few of the roles, and the cost of the Spyfall series. I accordingly made a P&P version of the game to address all of these issues and align the game closer to my tastes. The given rating is hence for my print and play edition of Spyfall. I have no desire to play the official version of the game.

This is a Resistance-like game reduced to the most simple it can probably be, and it works great. There are almost no decisions to be made, this is pure talking to unmask the spy, and you have to be vague but not too vague all the time, just like in Dixit. Brilliant idea. I'm hopeful this will work just as well with three players.

So far played a couple times at the 5P count.  Almost seems like a game of seeing how well one's social skills are as players need to be constantly aware of how they are giving questions and answers.

I can see the rating for this going up depending on the group.

First of all this game needs a right place with right kind of "players". Otherwise it's a disaster. There isn't that much game included - Spyfall feels more like a way to spend some time together, than actually game. Which isn't bad thing, but it means for me, that there aren't that many places and times, when I would choose Spyfall before something else.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Spyfall is played over several rounds, and at the start of each round all players receive cards showing the same location — a casino, a traveling circus, a pirate ship, or even a space station — except that one player receives a card that says "Spy" instead of the location. Players then start asking each other questions — "Why are you dressed so strangely?" or "When was the last time we got a payday?" or anything else you can come up with — trying to guess who among them is the spy. The spy doesn't know where he is, so he has to listen carefully. When it's his time to answer, he'd better create a good story!

It depends heavily on the people playing it. If you're rather introverted and don't like creative and social games you will hate it. For my friends and me it's a pleasure to play it - even 15 times in a row. Who cares if you win or lose? It's all about the fun you can have! So.. on a scale from 1 to 10.. how dirty is your underwear after a typical work day?

People who are familiar with the game and locations will have a huge leg up on new players. I found it entertaining once I realized how the game functioned with the group with whom I was playing, but I'm not sure I would seek out games of this to play. This would be very group dependent.

Es dauert recht lange bis man in die Pötte kommt. Einfach mal was fragen ist gar nicht so einfach... Da wird Minutenlang überlegt, das empfinde ich schon als Druck für denjenigen, der an der Reihe ist. Ich bin auch sehr froh, dass ich keinmal der Spion war. Ich hätte nichts gewusst, dafür wurde für die Fragen zu lange überlegt und die Zeit war dann zu früh um. Jeder kam vielleicht einmal dran.
Man sollte keinen Timer als Uhr stellen, vielmehr sind 3x #Spieler an Fragen erlaubt und dann ist ende (oder so was), das fänd ich besser.

This game is crazy fun. When a group evolves to creating and incorporating subtle “in-the-know” hints into questions and answers the game just gets even better. It makes for an enjoyable exercise in creative subterfuge to both reveal and conceal pertinent information in the same breath.

RATING: 7
This is my favorite humorous party game so far (meaning, a party game that really makes you laugh).  It's easy to understand but really hard to master. 

This is a game that really depends on the group, like all party games really.  With my family, the spy usually wins, even though there's only 4 people.  That's because we are good at realizing why people are saying the answers they are--what would be "subtle" to most people is almost "obvious" to us.

This game is fun and yet still really hard!

The only thing I don't like about it is that people keep asking the same questions.  There's no regulation on what questions can be asked, so I don't know HOW MANY TIMES I've heard the question, "why are you here?" or "what do you do here?".  I wish there was a way to force people to be more creative.  At any rate: it depends on the people you play with!

Actually, one other thing I don't like, is that it just feels like this game would be better if there were one other thing going on.  It's just a tad too simple.  Party games are supposed to be simple.  But for this to be the best party game of all time, I want a little more.  I don't know what that thing would be, but hey, no one said designing the best games of all time was easy.

Edit: just played it with my parents-in-law, who apparently are really GREAT at asking questions.  That made it even funner.  I think it's a huge plus for a party game if it brings out different aspects in different groups of people, so it doesn't get stale.

This incredibly simple party game simulates the experience of laughing at inside jokes you aren't in on. Up to 8 players are given a card describing a shared location, except for the spy who receives no information at all. Players must determine successfully who is the spy by asking questions about their location and judging the responses. If a spy can guess their location before they're found, the spy wins!

A very fun party game that's easy to gimmick. If you have about 5-8 people who are looking to roleplay and have fun with the game it's awesome. If you have less than 5 or 5-8 people who want to win regardless of how they play the game it can be a bit of a chore. Overall with the right group this is a super fun party game, one of my favorites.

RATING: 4
As a certain BreakfastMan who might be the only person who reads my comments knows I'm not really a fan of social deduction. However, for those who are there is a lot of good things going on in this game. You have to balance giving out questions and answers clear enough that other people don't think are the spy while vague enough that the spy doesn't catch on to the location. Meanwhile the spy needs to give vague enough answers/questions so as to not give an illogical answer, while not so vague as to appear dodgy. It is also fairly short and while you are basically doing the same thing each game what questions you ask varies a lot by location and person; you could also expand the game yourself or make your own portable version. My downsides are that I think this game would do better as a computer game, as then the spy can't give him/herself away by constantly looking at the possible locations, and also it might work better with a set number of questions asked, as while the spy can't just stall forever without looking suspicious the amount of time it takes for people to think up questions can really affect the game.

I love Spyfall, but it's another one that I don't really enjoy with newer people. I love giving a super clearing answer and then a misleading one the next time I'm asked something. I really enjoy straddling the line between other people knowing I'm good and not tipping off the spy.

I do think that it's a very unbalanced game because the spy loses probably 90% of the time with people that know what they're doing, but it's still a ton of fun, as long as you're not the spy too often. Maybe giving the spy a guess when caught would help?

This one is teetering on the edge for me. I honestly enjoy playing, however, there are some minor issues:

- Being the spy and going first. It's incredibly difficult even if you are experienced with social games like this one.

- The roles are amusing, but honestly I wonder if they really add anything to the game?

- Some of the locations are a bit bizarre, and can lead to seriously uneven, or unfun, results.

So far I've liked most of my plays, but I'm not so sure everyone has. Time will tell.

Update:

The game really requires a group of experienced players for best results. There are too may options which play as quickly, and have a lower experience threshold, which results in fewer plays of this.

Fun social deduction game where you ask someone a question about the location they are present in but not so well that the spy can figure out where you are.  Because if they can figure it out, they win that round and score points.  Typically the spy should be captured but occasionally they can typically get it down to two locations.  

Fun, but more of an activity than a true game.  You seem to laugh the whole time though.

Be warned that this is a parlor game propped up by its players. It can be tricky to figure out how to begin, and rounds can end prematurely.

Spyfall can be spectacular as an opener/closer, and the timer grants a merciful exit in the event that a session flops. Contrary to the suggestion in the rules, I don't think five rounds are necessary.

The pass-and-play web app is good: there's no deck-baggie mixing for setup, and the timer is built-in. Bringing a printed list of all roles and locations is also useful, in part to interpret role-related hints, but especially because it gives the spy an excuse to look at the list of locations.

I want to try [boardgame=135779][/boardgame], which looks like an earlier development of a similar idea.

Social Deduction Game, Secret Role. Every person gets a card with a location,and one player gets a Spy card (so he doesnt know where he is). Players take turns to ask questions about the location and try to pinpoint the spy. The spy is trying to figure out where he is or just blend in with all the other people.

SPYFALL_間碟危機
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Spyfall can be both; a hilarious party game or a boring and repetitive game. It boils down to the question is everyone aiming for a fun game or just winning it, or worse, just avoiding their turns.
The rules about the questions are as ambiguous as the boring questions/answers some players may ask/give so some kind of house ruling may be in place.
At best (i.e. with the right players) the game is a blast and gets multiple plays during an evening.
My only real caveat is that remembering all the locations during the first playtimes can be a pain for the spy. Just putting the center page of the rulebook open on the table doesn't work well enough.

RATING: 6
Rating based on 8 players.

I think this game is really, really dependent on the group you play with. I played at a con in a group where a lot of us didn't know each other and were playing for the first time, and it fell pretty flat for me.  I found it really hard to keep track of everything, it puts people on the spot with generating questions/answers (I'm not great at ad-libbing), and with so many players a lot of people don't have a chance to answer/ask. 

I can definitely see the potential of this game, but think 5/6 players would be a much better count, and you need the right group.

RATING: 9.5
A social deduction game that really brings the deduction to the forefront and forces the participation of everyone, it can hardly get any better than that, so far everyone has really enjoyed it.

Quick game, great concept, great replayability, easily expandable, this could become a must-have filler for every gaming night from now on. The concept is so simple, yet amazing, it's hard to believe this game wasn't invented before. It has everything to become a classic just like Werewolf.

(I hope they create an official Android/iPhone Spyfall app, as this is a very convenient way to play the game. Very easy to randomize locations and roles, anyone could see the list of locations on their own phone/tablet, and so on.)

Good: 
Easy to teach hidden roles party game. 

Playing with roles cause general confusion which results in entertaining banter when trying to figure out who really is the spy. 

Quality cards with very eye pleasing artwork. 

Bad: 
Because there is an extreme lack of information available to the spy the role is intimidating to some players. So much in fact some will not be interested in playing this game at all. 

There should be location cheat sheets available to all of the players so the instruction book doesn't need to be handed around the table.

A more social game than I'm used to. The usual deception and talking-based gameplay that many party games are built around is alive and well here. Kind of stressful for introverts, and helps to have a group that is familiar with the game already because the game involves asking telling questions about a single location out of many. Beginner spies have their work cut out for them, but it is a fun game with the right group of people.

This is the only "Werewolf" type game that is worth playing. There isn't a lot of structure here, but the rules that are present give a much needed sense of direction, urgency, and solid information to formulate deductions and accusations with.

Don't start your friends off with "Werewolf" or "Mafia." Jump straight to this. It's leaner, faster, more fun, and everyone is in the game until the end.

RATING: 6
There's this torturous tension running through the game as everyone speaks haltingly trying not to give away to much. If one were to overhear the conversation it would sound like the most amateur spy-gathering where everyone is a clueless double-agent. "So say.... how... did you get... here?" "Um... well.... like... you know... everyone else?!"

I think this game will shine more rather than lose its lustre as you play more and establish a meta-game of sorts for the different locations. Old questions suddenly become double-edged and you must reach further and further to not be too obvious.

The primary drawback is that everyone needs to have the locations at their fingertips, and you need to establish a rule that makes everyone look at the map of locations instead of the card they were given, otherwise I don't think it'll be any fun for the spy, at least not until it's been played a lot.

A great game, more fast, fun and loose than say One Night Werewolf, but that's sometimes what you are after (less strict deduction in this, more gut feelings and nervous laughs).

AMAZING game for 6-8 people groups. Easily the best party game I've ever played.

PROS
- Incredibly easy to explain. Suitable for EVERYONE, from hardcore to casual gamers.
- Really fun if the group wants it to be fun.
- Perfect duration (limited by the timer).
- Massive replayability (I've played more than 15 games in a row).

CONS
- If anyone is not comfortable with the game, mostly because they dislike being the spy and feel lost when doing it, just try something else. It's not gonna be as fun as it should.
- Printing a location guide is a good idea, as new players always struggle to slyly look at them whenever they're Spies

In Spyfall, players are given a secret location, like a hotel or a zoo. One player, however, is the spy, and the spy does not know where they are. If the spy can figure out where they are before they are identified, then the spy wins. 

Super fun game, though it can be tough to ask questions that don't give too much information away.

Quite unlike anything else I know. With four players, being the spy is quite difficult, but I managed to fool the other players couple of times. With eight players, the spy has it easier, but it's no automatic victory. Even if the spy fails, the game is interesting and entertaining. I'm quite sure this game will divide opinions heavily.

Suggest.

This is a great game to play with those who hate the lion's share of designer games.  Have played this with multiple groups who normally would roll their eyes when asked to play anything more complicated than Clue.

Better than Werewolf, yet given the choice I would probably play Coup or Resistance depending on the group number.

Funny party game, best with 5-6 persons, With 8 there is not enough time to ask questions to everyone and the spy gets under the radar more easily. Counting points is not essential, having fun is obligatory though!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.75
This is one of those games that the group playing it will be the decisive factor in having fun or not, in making this a good game or it falling completely flat...

Our first round of the game was completely awkward because none of us had played the game and so we took so much time to come up with questions to make and invariable the response would be "it depends"... that first round got me worried... 
We were a bit afraid of giving the spy more info than he should have and so we ended up giving the perfect replies for him to hide behind, but we figured that out and the next 2 rounds were much smoother and much more fun than the first...

I think that with the right kind of people this game can be a blast! With the wrong kind of people it will be a borefest!!!

This is a refreshingly different, asymmetrical "social deduction" game.  Playing a good-guy makes you feel like you are in-on-a-secret.  It is funny and challenging to come up with questions that are revealing without being obvious.  

The spy is under great tension to figure out the clues in the other questions and answers.  When you aren't sure where you are and a question comes your way, you feel like you are under the gun.  When you do figure it out, it is fun to play along and trick everyone.

Tried to play for the 1st time today with 4 friends and liked it very much. Rules are really easy, setup takes literally a minute (except maybe for the 1st time, when you have to sort the cards belonging to the same location into separate zip bags).

When we just started to play, it felt really awkward, because noone really knew what to ask :D But after a few rounds we started to get which questions are "correct" and what answers you have to provide both to assure others that you can be trusted while simultaneously trying not to give up the location. 

Definitely try roleplaying (every non-spy card has a role assigned to it) -- it helps a bit when you answer the questions and adds a lot of fun!

Some LPTs for beginners:
1) Avoid 'yes-no' questions (and basically any questions where only two opposite answers are possible) -- this doesn't provide any valuable information. 
2) Try luring the spy into a failure by providing a false choice where any choice is wrong. Like, if you're on a Submarine, asking 'Hey, Ralph, I had a bit too much booze yesterday, can you remind me what city we are heading to -- was it Denver or Dallas?' (neither has an access to open sea, so choosing either will mark the spy). Or ask 'What time did the sun set yesterday?' when you're at the Polar Research Station (where sun doesn't set for half a year).

UPD 2017-01-20: Now, when second edition is released, I have reassessed the rating a bit. The biggest issue with the game is that the spy has to have the list of locations in front of him all the time, otherwise it's really difficult to play as a spy, as you have to memorise all those 30 (or 20, in case of Spyfall 2) locations. Other than that, the game is still great and still generates tons of fun :]

Örülök, hogy kijött magyarul, mert így nem kellett nyomtatgatnom. Mindenképpen akartam ezt a játékot! Zseniális az ötlet! Élőben persze nem mindig működik olyan flottul, mert van akinek nehezebben megy a kérdezés (Dixit szindróma). Tudom ki erre a megfelelő társaság, és ott is bedobom, tuti siker lesz!
Így is nagyon szórakoztató, rengeteg nevetést szül. A kedvencem az a játékos, aki mindegy, hogy kém e, vagy nem, béna válaszokat ad és hülye kérdéseket tesz fel, ezzel röhögőgörcsöt és teljes zavart okozva. :)

I find this game irritating.  Truly dependent on the group learning 25 sites.  Any one with a lesser experience in the game is at a huge disadvantage.  People find being in the spy position can be uncomfortable when they just don't know the sites.  Every time we've had a chance to play, someone has never played it so we play something else.  

I just think there are lots of games that do this better when dealing with varying game experience.

Simple, quick, fun. More of an activity than a game, although the system breaks a bit if you don't count the points, as it changes the motives of the players a bit.

I like this game. The problem is, you can't bring this out with everyone. Being the spy is EXTREMELY stressful. I've seen people reveal themselves a lot when they're the spy multiple times in a row, even those who I never thought would do that.

It's a interesting concept to bring in front of people who haven't played it before. However, it's also the hardest for them. I find One Night Ultimate Werewolf to be a better game.

"Ermm... a.... uniform.... I work here... In this place where we do... all the things...."

I love Spyfall. Trying to pick every word perfectly so as to not give the game away. Aside from maybe 'One-Night Ultimate Werewolf', this is my favourite bluff/identity game. The Spy needs to guess what location the game is taking place in (Casino, Embassy, Submarine etc.) whilst everyone else asks each other questions to try and root them out. Everyone is trying to give enough detail to convince the non-spies that they are who they say they are, but without giving clues to the Spy as to the true location. It's a brilliant game, best played in a decent group of 5-7 I'd say. If you don't have a set of speakers and a quiet room for the Werewolf app, go straight to Spyfall.

I thought this would be a great party game and liked the idea that you don't even need a table to play. However, a lot of the questioning felt pretty artificial and didn't move as fluidly as I would have liked. I am sure the experience is heavily dependent on the group you play with.

(After 8 Plays) 1/30/18: Spyfall is very easy to understand and can be tough to master. A lot of people I have played games with have mastered the art of lying in a social deduction game but this one seems to bring a wrinkle that many stumble over. Many struggle to think of questions and this issue is magnified for the player who is the spy. While I still really enjoy this game, it can fall flat with the wrong people playing.

A Werewolf-type social game where one of you is the hidden player and essentially must figure out what is the location shared by the other players (handed out randomly on the initial setup) without outing himself. The rest are of course trying to figure out which one among them is the spy/traitor. Main "mechanic"is essentially going around asking questions before a timer runs out. Any question. Any answer. yipee

Seriously. This is a joke.

The idea that anyone actually pays money for this is pretty sad. There's nothing clever here at all, and the supposed "blast" that can be had has more to do with being focused on a silly activity with your drunk friends than any clever touches or creative flourishes. This is no more of a success of social deduction games than if Cards against humanity or similar party-crap like that had a traitor mechanic. Avoid at all cost or at the very least have the decency of not paying over 5 bucks to get this crap.

Really love this one and even though it's not similar to Codenames in most ways, to me it "feels" more like it but better even though I appreciate codenames as being more clever in some ways. Of the two, I'd rather play Spyfall generally event hough there's probably room for both and certainly room for other great hidden role games such as Bang the dice game, Shadow Hunters, Resistance, Coven etc. This is a real winner though and super accessible. Definitely worth sleeving despite having so many cards.

This is an excellent party game, but... It's really hard to teach it to new players and/or when you have just one person that hasn't played the game before...

I must be one of seven people on this planet who actively dislikes this game.  It thinks it's much more clever than it is, but anyone with three brain cells to rub can figure out the location soon enough.  From there the entire game becomes "the spy wins if no one approaches them until the third round or later", and even then if the wrong person gives an easy 'out' of a question the spy is in the clear.

What's that, you say?  Play with less people?  Sorta takes the "party game" out of the experience in seconds.  And at that point, I'd rather play Coup.

Anti-fun.  Anti-game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
After playing this many times, the fun has somewhat worn off for everyone.  The issue with this game is you have to ask quality questions, which turns into long periods of silence in a game about talking, or stupid questions that don't go anywhere.  If you have players that want to be vague for the sake of being vague, the game gets very stale very fast and no one wants to play.

A Werewolf game with a twist different enough to be a stand alone game. As werewolf, it's a social bluffing game with a traitor that depends on the players' involvement. And as in Werewolf, the spy is under great pressure.

The design is not very clean:
A) Players need thinking time to come up with both the correct questions and answers. Since this is a game usually played with many players, the time between turns will be huge. Werewolf games are way superior in this.
B) The spy needs to look constantly at the location list and the rest of the players don't. If they don't do it as well, the spy will be easily spotted.
C) If they spy is between the first ones to ask/answer, it will be really hard for him to hide. If he's one of the last ones, he will already have shortened the location list enough.
D) You cannot change the locations each game because of B). I think the game may become burnt because new questions and answers must be found each time an old location reappears.

First impression (4 players) : 
Might be better/best with 5-6 players but was fun with 4 too. As I like simple/elegant games I liked this one too even though I'm not too big fan of these games that are "all talk" (but i like outguessing/outbluffing). Probably my new favorite of this "all-talk" genre.

Trying to avoid being suspicious enough as a spy is fun! (But I'm too suspicious as normal player too.. as I'm overly not-too-obvious).

Idea del gioco veramente bella. E' un party game decisamente simpatico e anche originale. Permette di giocare molto con la fantasia. Necessita della giusta compagnia per essere apprezzato e giocato al meglio. Le primissime partite potrebbero non riuscire se non si ha dimestichezza o memoria delle varie location, specie per la spia. Da valutare invece se il gioco alla lunga, se giocato con gli stessi amici, possa accusare un po' di problemi di longevità risultando ripetitivo e magari prevedibile. Per il momento lo promuovo a pieni voti e ho voglia di rigiocarci, anche perché è un gioco semplice da spiegare, veloce e non necessita di grossa componentistica.

I was really looking forward to this based on a review by Shut Up & Sit Down. 

However, playing in a group, it was really easy to make out the spy. With two questions in every round, we named the spy in a group of six. It was easy to ask a question that gave the slightest hint of the location or at least that you knew the location, but vague enough to not give it away. The spy invariably had a tell when it came to their question and it was over. 

In one round, the spy simply gave a sideways glance and the round was over. It was really confusing as to how this could be fun!

I won't be playing this one again. This would take a lot of practice to get good at avoiding being made and you would have to memorize all the locations, because if you looked at the location list while the round was on, you'd be made.

[i]I played this the same night I learned Cuba de Mafia and Spyfall fell flat for some of us. I believe only one out of the six of us had played before and that didn't fare well for the spy. When you start playing this game you have no idea what the locations are and even though there is a sheet that shows you the locations it's a bit obvious if you keep looking at it. Basically this meant that it didn't take us long to nail the spy. I'm sure repeated play would solve that problem, but I didn't find the whole premise of the game to be fun. I don't need any extra mechanics in a bluffing game, I'll take the simplicity of Cockroach Poker's game play which allows the meta game to quickly develop among players. I knew before playing that Spyfall probably wasn't my type of game and playing confirmed that. [/i]

When Werewolf wears out, Spyfall has been its engaging replacement. Sort of. The central mechanic and flow of the game is deduction and bluffing, just like Werewolf, but this is an incredibly hard game to play. Finding the right question, finding the right answer, trying to find out who the spy is, the whole experience could be more stressful and frustrating than fun, no matter what side you're on. If you don't care about winning and just want to laugh at the absurdity, then Spyfall can fill in the gaps between games.

It was novel to play a hidden roles game that didn't become a tedious argument and the idea is clever; to give clues that show you know what the secret location is without making it obvious for the spy. One downside is that unless the spy player is familiar with the game he will keep having to check the locations card to remind himself of the options, and inadvertently expose himself. It would be easy to make a homemade version of this game with lots of thought up expansions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A free form Q&A game, where the art to playing well is quickly determining questions that are sufficiently loaded so as to let others know that you know where the team is, but not give the location away to the spy (who's trying to work out the team's location from a list of 30 or so), and which also provides an opportunity for the answerer to provide an answer that does similar. Or catch the spy in an answer that reveals he doesn't know where the team is. Which provides a recipe for word puns and cleverness which I enjoy. But I hate being the spy in these types of games, so I'm never quite sure how to rate them.

The swedish word "spy" means puke. This is not a game, It's "20 questions". Just boring, nothing else. Only one good thing about it: it's short, and thus over soon. But that also is a downside, because then they want to play another and another time.

The design of the game is pretty brilliant - super fun, works well for a variety of groups and doesn't get old. Really works well for a long while and develops a fun little meta around it. The production is great, it seems fiddly with the cards and baggies but everything works well and is really fun. 

The only problem I have with this game is the choice of locations and roles. It could have been more consistent and interesting. Why is there a crusader army but not other historical aspects? It's a different situation, not just a location. I also dislike cards like a 'pick up artist' at the nightclub. I wish it wasn't a part of this game, I would enjoy it much more.

I am generally not a fan of these light party games and this one just strengthen's my reasoning. You each get a role, with one person as a spy and then you must ask questions to each other. The spy must determine where you are from a list of about 30 locations. Those who have roles in the location need to be vague while the spy needs to subtly get clues. But it is not fun, sure there may be some laughs but as a game it is just random and repetitive. Luckily there is a time limit.

In theory I would love this game more. The issue is the people I play with. This game needs people who can think on the spot and be creative. All too often when I play it becomes the same 15 or so questions that get asked over and over. We have had some good laughs with it, though.
Also, playing with only 3 sucks because the spy gets asked something every 3rd question, and you never have the possibility to ask the person who just asked you a question (that's the rules), so questioning just goes in a circle.

Spyfall is a team game in which most of the players are trying to ask each other questions in order to figure out which one player (the Spy) doesn't know what location their out.  The Spy player, on the other hand, is trying to figure out the location.  So basically, players want to prove their identity without giving away key information.  This game didn't really work for me at all, since I'm not a verbal person.  I don't really like talking at all, so I found it really difficult to engage with this game.

Good quick 'party' game for up to 8. A set of cards is drawn and distributed. It shows a location to all but one of the players. Players ask each other questions and seek answers that hint of their knowledge of the location but without being too obvious. One of the players is the Spy. He does not know the location so has to bluff if he is questioned and in the questions he poses others. His objection is to try to deduce the location; the others' objective is to identify the Spy.

Finally got to play this one and it's a really fun clever game.  My ONLY issue with this game is that for such a light game it takes some time to setup.  They really need to create an official phone app that fixes this, especially considering that with a phone app it would decrease production costs.  Since they do not need to make a large amount of cards they can still sell the game at the same price since it will unlock the app.

But regardless this is a great game

Fun and pretty stressful deduction game. Everyone receives a card, all but one with the same picture of a location. The last player has a card with the Spy on it. Since the cards are dealt out secretly, noone can be sure who is who. Then the players start asking each other questions about the location, trying to faind out who is the spy. Meanwhile, the spy tries to stay hidden and use the other players questions and answers to guess the location. The game has a time limit and if the spy hasn't been found out or hvae guessed the location by then, the players take a vote on who the spy is.

I may pick up a physical copy in the future, but I'm in no rush since the app/site works great. That is, unless it's glitching out and randomly resetting games.

EDIT: May be to open ended for me. It seems overly difficult to play as spy, and trying to come up with a question whether you're one or not can be a drag. There's room for being clever and taking risks, but overall, the game relies too much on people's improvisation skills rather than logic. 

I know it's not meant to be taken too seriously and just played for the laughs, but like I said earlier, the lack of structure can be debilitating and make games fall flat.

Finally, a social deduction game that I didn't hate. One player is the Spy, the others are all given a card showing the same location ('school', 'police station', 'submarine' etc.) Players take turns to ask each other questions, with the aim of catching out the Spy without giving away the location. Unlike other social deduction games I've played, the focus is not on elaborate chains of logic but just pure laugh-out-loud silliness.

Really fun and easy to play. I think it's important to have a good teacher to make sure the first play experience doesn't go poorly. It's also really required to print some reference cards with all the possible locations (and encourage all players to look at them). Otherwise the spy will really feel like the game is too hard. I know many people don't like to play with the specific roles on each card, but I think that they're an important balancing mechanism and if you don't then it makes the game too hard for the spy.

Spyfall is a very light social deception game. Each player is dealt a card that contains the location they are all at, and what their role is (for example, you might be the coat check guy at the theater). One person is the spy, and does not know what the location is. The dealer asks a question of someone, and that person answers. The spy is trying to figure out where they are, and the others and trying to out the spy. Whoever is asked a question then asks the next one. The challenge is stalling if you're the spy, or asking useful questions to either determine the location or the spy. 

Light, a more puzzly type of game reminiscent of ONUW, but with discrete information. If you can get a copy of the Russian game, it has tremendous art.

Overall the game will likely leave you rather unimpressed, the game certainly works, and it is a discrete experience, but it's not particularly fun.

It contains several layers of strategy that only become apparent in later plays. It's funny. Everyone (both the regular players and the spy) has a great secret, which is an awesome feeling. It's short. Every moment is tense. You can play it with ANYONE. I give it my highest recommendation.

Spyfall is a fast and simple bluffing game, but it has a tendency to just devolve into the same tired questions and responses over and over, especially when played with new people.

The puzzle here of finding the signal from the noise is occasionally humorous, but lacks the thought and creativity of other group games like One Night Werewolf, Coup, Mafia De Cuba, or most notably the Resistance.

I don't like this one nearly as much as Codenames, and there's a lot of pressure on you when you have to lie your way out, which I find can be compensated for by knowing the locations well and guessing as early as possible. My 10-year-old niece loves it though.

Interesting game.

In the group everyone know the location except for the spy.  So the spy tries to identify the location while the rest of the group tried to identify the spy.

The mechanism is to ask and answer questions about the location.  So if the location is a space station and you ask someone what the see when they look out the window and their response is: "I see trees and birds" they've let everyone know they are the spy.  If they say, "I see stars and planets" then they've given too much info to the spy.

My teens really enjoy this game and request it often.

It's a great concept for a new kind of social deduction...recommended.

I was VERY excited when I first heard about Spyfall. Now that I've played it a few times, it's not quite as good as I expected, but it's still really fun. It's extremely easy to learn and can lead to some laughs, but overall it didn't quite hit the homerun I thought it would.

RATING: N/A
Description: Social deduction, bluffing, party game with asking questions.
Weight: Very light.
Number of players: 4 to 8. Best with 6 or 7.

Impression: My favorite party game judging by the amount of humor and laughter it produces. It is very simple. Every player knows where they are except one who is a Spy. Spy must find out the location before the other find out he/she is a Spy. And everything is in asking the right questions. Brilliant.

Likes: Situations where you have to be creative with the questions in order not to be exposed, or not to give away the location.

Dislikes: In the beginning it is hard to remember all the possible locations which can give away the Spy. Later same questions start to reappear and you must get extra creative to avoid it.

Truly stressful on all accounts. The effort required to think through what I'm asking or answering, to avoid leaking information while simultaneously confirming my status, is a stress that I rather not have. The social deduction aspect is overshadowed by the sheer effort of coming up with sentences devoid of information.

As soon as Spyfall ends I want to play it again. It's like eating popcorn.

Our group likes it a lot.

There is plenty of silly deception and deduction. You need to use your imagination too.

The game seems to evolve with different people and over time, increasing replay value a lot.

It's huge fun simply trying to think of endless different ways to say "I am at xxxx location" while trying to be very vague ... but not vague enough that it looks like you don't actually KNOW the location. That's the basis of the game.

The idea is that the everyone but the spy must keep their questions and answers ambiguous, but not too ambiguous. They need to beguile the spy while avoiding being accused of being the spy, themselves.

The reality is that the spy, if he's asked early enough, will almost always give an inappropriate response and be outed early.

Also, the first 5 times you play are strange, but the more you play the better everyone gets at it. And then people start playing their parts and acting out. Also, giving little clues is more fun than trying not to give any at all.

RATING: 7
A fascinating take on social deduction, but it's got some rough edges as printed.  The spy seems to be in a nearly impossible situation, at least until you memorize EVERY location,  But requiring that level of familiarity just to play a light social game is a problem.  Better play aids could help a lot, and I'm annoyed at their absence from the first edition.

update:  I think I'd always rather play Deception.  They scratch the same itch for me, and Deception doesn't have the same issues as Spyfall about needing to print extra reminder sheets and being so punishing for new player getting stuck as the traitor/murderer/spy.  A social game should be accessible to new players, and I find that spyfall is not, which keeps it off the table far too often.

26-06-2015. Woooooo. Spyfall. I played just 3 rounds, but screw scoring.

In 8 minutes, a group of people try to find out who amongst them is a spy. The group knows at what location they are, and the spy aims to find out. The game works by the players asking questions to eachother. If they find out who the spy is, they win. If the time runs out or the spy finds out at what location they are.. he wins.

Fun game. Excellent. Highly recommended. The game is like 1-shot resistance. Find the traitor by asking questins about the location.. and these and the answers can become interesting, funny.. hilarious.

Highly, highly recommended as a party game.. and that from someone who doesn't enjoy party games..

This is a great game. The only problem is that the locations that are the most fun are copyrighted so that the game designers couldn't use them.

This game can be fun for a bit, depending on who you're playing with. I find that too often, the game sort of gets stuck where people just don't have creative ideas to describe the venue, or it is just too abstract to be of value. It is almost more fun the first few times you play with new people, and as you play more it gets less and less fun because people get so cautious and conservative.

I find this game to be extremely stressful when I'm the Spy, and hate being dealt it. It's not a super pleasant feeling, but I've gone along with it because it's been pretty popular amongst the people I've played it with. However, I've more recently played The Chameleon, and I feel that game gives you a similar feel as Spyfall without as much stress and in about half the time as Spyfall, and I think I prefer that game to this one now.

A social deduction game where all the players at the table secretly get the same location card... except for one player whose card only says "SPY".

This is a really good game that depends SO MUCH on who you play it with. With a good group that buys into the roleplay aspect, this game works very well, but with those that don't really "get" social deduction games, it can fall pretty flat. Recommended at the 5-6 or so player count.

Another in the line of modern party/social games where ambiguity is the name of the game. Reveal enough to let others know you know the location without letting the Spy catch on. As the Spy, be vague enough that others can see you being deliberately vague. I like the free-form creativity that goes into the questions and answers. It's natural to throw out a yes-no question, but those are always the most useless. This game should teach me to ask better questions!

4+4

RATING: 7
Spyfall underwhelmed me somewhat the first time we brought it out, because it was a lot of fun but just felt a tiny bit too awkward and clunky as a party game for us to really enjoy. Recently, though, a family member brought their own copy to a party. He had printed out the player aid cards thoughtfully provided by kenzlo here on BGG, and the game plays about a hundred times better with just the addition of a little card for everyone to look at whenever they're idle. It's so much of an improvement in the gameplay that I'm kind of surprised the game doesn't just include something like it in the box. I proceeded to print out copies of the same cards for my own copy, and our playgroup absolutely loves the game now.

Having the reference cards is really useful for everyone: It gives the spy a handy reference that doesn't require her to peer obviously at the middle of the table, and even non-spies find it useful to refer to for coming up with better, more-vague-but-not-too-suspicious questions and responses to try and befuddle the spy. We also typically play in casual settings, sitting on sofas together or whatever, so it's useful to have a second card you can use to cover up your card so that nobody is shoulder-surfing you.

Not exactly what I expected - it's very emergent and group depended. Needs a group that will play it a couple of times in a row before it all clicks. 

It's really necessary for players to know, actually know, which all are locations are, so player aids with all of them listed are a must. Having just one place where all of them are listed is stupid - if I'm a spy I won't be able too look at it for too long without being suspicious. Here is where Fake Artist in New York probably does it better with a combination of "category" and "specific thing within it". 
Because of this it takes time for a group to internalise all the locations. As it wasy we were drowning in vague questions and generic answers. 

The game has this weird vibe, it's not a "party" party game. It's kinda like cool kids hanging together and a newcomer wants to infiltrate in the scene and hopes they don't stand out so that everybody will notice how uncool they are. 
[i]hey how's it going?
down!
where you've been?
around
what's cooking?
lunch?
(and everybody looks at you, yikes!)[/i]

It's this suppressed, casual talk trying hard not to raise suspicion vibe, but with all the tension of the world hidden under the surface. And everybody found it damn hard to ask questions which is a weird experience for a spy. As opposed to resistance/werewolf style games here no side has the needed information. While as a spy, they're out to get you, they're lost as well, and you really become focused and curious about what others are saying. Which makes it hard for others to spot you as you're as curios and paranoid as anybody else. 

Jury's still out, appraising the game, as it will probably get better with repeated plays. Also I've realised I don't really need to buy it. as all the art in the game is meaningless and home made copy suffices (with player aids!). I suspect I'll like Fake Artist in New York better. 

EDIT - rating way down, because Fake Artist is just so much better and simpler and more creative.

It's a nice idea, but very challenging actually. It also seems much easier for the agent than for the other players (resulting in almost every round the agent receiving 4 points).

RATING: 8
This is a great party game for up to 8 players. 
Plays fast and extremely fun.
Downside is for first time players, being the spy is super difficult... we house ruled that the one questioned or doing the questioning gets to check the locations guide found in the middle of the rule book. 
As an improvement... I suggest this game should come with 8 copies of said location guide.
we make do with what it is... and it's still definitely a keeper.

Social deduction game. This one is tough. When you first start, nobody knows how to ask good questions and/or give good answers. Some people got hung up on using the artwork on the cards for clues, which is both against the spirit of the game and not really the right way to play. This game could as well be played with just words written on each card (the PnP is this way as is the webapp someone wrote).

Then suddenly we had a couple of good questions and I could not contain myself, I was laughing so hard, which is a dead giveaway. The location was Pirate Ship. I asked someone, "So, do you like to shake your booty here?" The answer given was, "I don't know about shaking it, but I'm all about the booty." There were a lot of giggles and smirks. See, the people in on it see how clever the question and answer were, but if you were the spy I don't think you could tell we were talking pirate's booty and not the booty your momma gave you.

The next good question was, "So, do you enjoy this life?" to which the player responded, "Well, it's the only life for me." I was in tears.

That's the potential of this game, but it depends on the players if they can get past the initial awkwardness of figuring out how to ask/answer questions.

This game is very intense, especially for the spy. 
Quite the enjoyable deduction game if your into those! A good group really brings this game to life.

It's a little tough for new players since they have to memorize all the locations before the game starts since looking at it mid-game can give you away. 

This game is also on an app but playing with the cards feels more intense and group involving to me. 

Very Fun!

Theme makes no sense. Things get very meta when you play with the same group alot. Still, some of the most fun I've had with a party game. Some people just can't lie under pressure, and kids in particular seem to have trouble with this one. Also, the theme makes no sense. I know I'm repeating, but it makes the game harder to teach than it should be. For what amounts to a role playing/improve/deduction game the lack of logic in how the theme is supposed to work hampers it.

RATING: 7
A simple premise of hidden roles, bluffing, trying to find the spy for others and trying to guess the location for the spy. If you want the illustrated cards, buy the official version but since in my experience you hardly get to look at the cards, the art is superfluous and thus I will most likely sell mind and just create a PNP version.

Edit: I procured a Russian version for cheap so I will keep the "official" cards for now. Also played with kids aged 9, who turned out to be really good at the game. Since they do not read English text yet, actual pictures are the only way to play with them. Elevating the original score of 6 to 7 thanks to this recent experience.

It's an excellent party game, although we do find that it is a lot more fun with 6-8 players than it is with 3-4. It takes just a couple of minutes to teach new players the rules and so far we've hooked everyone who has tried it. We ignore the scoring rules and just play each round as it's own self-contained game, and we find that most players are thinking "Let's play just one more round!" at the end of each game.

Interesting party game. I think you need several plays for this to hit the sweet spot, so that you can appropriately bluff both as the spy and as the non-spy team. It was a bit too easy to obscure things for the spy while still knowing who was in on the location.

I like social deduction games.  Spyfall inverts the genre by keeping the bad guy in the dark.  The goal is to figure out who he is without giving away the information known by everyone else.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is one of my favorite new party games.  The way it is played is incredibly simple.  There are a ton of locations and one is picked randomly for each round.  The location cards are shuffled up with a spy card and handed out to players randomly.  The non-spies each can see where they are but the spy cannot.  In order for the non-spies to win they need to find the spy and in order for the spy to win he needs to figure out the location the non-spy players are at.

In order to figure this out players will take turns asking and answering simple questions.  This is where the game gets so cool.  The non-spies have to ask and answer questions in ways that they can determine another player is not or prove themselves not a spy while also not giving away too much information about their location.  Meanwhile the spy has to ask questions that help him narrow down the location while also not appearing to probe too hard.  He also has to answer the questions in vague ways so it appears he could know the locations but is just trying not to divulge too much information.

The game is so simple and so nuanced it's amazing.  Also, as a simple social experience it is tons of fun.  I will say that the gameplay if you let the time run out where you have to go around the table and unanimously vote on who the spy is is a little wonky but all of our rounds have ended with the spy revealing himself early and guessing the location with about 50/50 success.  That's another really neat aspect of the game.  The spy can't help but get really anxious and paranoid that people have him figured out, even though sometimes people really didn't have any idea they were the spy until they revealed themselves.

Also, the guy with the gun on the box cover is creeping me the hell out.

Like most party games, this is very group dependent - had either amazing sessions where multiple rounds were played or extremely flat sessions where the group was one and done. 

If your group can role play a bit, be creative - this could be a hit. (My musician friends loved this; my doctor friends were confused) 

Updated Feb 2017: Lowered rating from 7.5 to 7.  One person can ruin game dynamic if they hate it or can't role play at all. They can ask totally unrelated questions and/or give crappy answers. In my last gaming session I flat out had one person say "I hate this game" during the very first round. Deception Murder in Hong Kong was also played in that game session and it tends to hook more people.

Party/social deduction game where n-1 players have cards showing the same location and an appropriate role ("Hospital / Nurse") while the last poor soul is a particularly unobservant spy with no idea where he or she is. Players take turns asking and answering questions in a vague enough manner to unearth the spy without revealing the location.

It was late in the day but good lord I'm bad at this game. At the time I admired others' questions and answers with revealing wordplay ("Do you spend a lot of time waiting around here?" in the restaurant) though in hindsight I wonder if these were too revealing. There's a delicate balance to it.

It's a clever design and I truly appreciate the arguably-thematic immersion (though at times it seemed more like training for doublespeaking politicians than spies), but on the other hand I utterly loathe it and will actively seek to never play it again. :)

RATING: 5
There's a pretty good game design hidden somewhere in the Spyfall box - unfortunately the game production actively works against it. The fact that there's two dozen possible locations means that the spy is severely handicapped in their ability to make intelligent guesses. Similarly, the colorful and detailed drawings make it easy for the non-Spy team to ferret out the spy using trivial art details - hardly sporting. The game would have been a lot better and more intelligent if there were perhaps only eight locations to choose from, using more abstract, less detailed art. Sometimes less is more. 

The game then tries to patch this self-inflicted imbalance by suggesting that the players play "roles" that will give the spy more confusion to hide under. Again, a good idea in theory, but in practice there's no mechanical way to enforce the role-play. I can ignore my role whenever it suits me, and neither the game nor the other players would be able to tell. Contrast that to Dixit, where the game can explicitly punish players who make their clues too obvious. It's just dumb. I feel bad for the game designer whose game got ruined by the publisher.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I get stressed and anxious just thinking about playing this game.

Each round, you think to yourself "Don't be the spy, don't be the spy, don't be the spy..."

The best part about this game is it is all about interaction with your friends.  There isn't a board or an individual player mat in front of you to distract you.  It is all about your buddies and the incredibly funny things that they come up with to say.

PLEASE NOTE:  I believe questions like "what color is the room" or "what do you smell" break the game.  To have fun with this game, you MUST role-play.  Think about it.  The people in the round who are not a spy, would not want to let the spy know they are on to him.  If this was you in real life, you wouldn't ask such an obvious question.  You would be more creative like, "Hey, did you see the new toy they put for us in the entrance?"

Those first two questions just aren't thematic.  Can you imagine going up to a co-worker in real life and asking him, "hey, what was the color of the room right behind you".  It just doesn't make sense, it isn't fun to me.

I highly suggest adding a rule where you have to roleplay a bit.  Don't ask questions out of character.  It makes the game a lot more fun.

Pretty boring game based on the 'everyone but 1 is in and you figure out who it is' deduction principle.

Requires everyone to be intimately familiar with all locations, but even then is a bore. Would much, much prefer 'A Fake Artist goes to New York' over this because there you add laughs to the deduction, and it strips away the need to familiarize yourself with the game.

This is pure deduction. And a boring one at that. Not at all impressed. If you like this genre, The Resistance, AFgtNY and even Werewolves are all much better entries, and I suggest you try these out before buying this.

RATING: 5
Spyfall is an incredible concept for a game. I liked it a lot more before I played it a few times. Spyfall is an excellent game for people who know Spyfall very well. It's a game fundamentally centered around artfully directed awkward conversations and carefully reading into cues in those conversations. Which might sound fun but in practice I've yet to find many people who can comfortably get their bearings in the time it takes to win or lose a game of Spyfall--let alone make very many interesting or exciting plays.

I find A Fake Artist Goes to New York captures the tactical concepts of Spyfall but makes playing as the spy/fake much more plausible. While Spyfall certainly can create hilarious and wonderful situations, it can also create a lot more awkwardness and frustration than I've ever had come out of Fake Artist.

Like many of these games, the game can be played in a number of ways, not many of which are very satisfying. As its best, Spyfall is played in such a way that players are telling other players that they aren't the spy in their questions as much as in their answers (so, a question about - did you drive here on your own, or did you share a car with other people - might tip off other non-Spies that you know the location is a circus while the person's answer might also reveal information). The trick is to find that clever balance between 'clearing' players by revealing information and not revealing so much that the spy can hide or guess. It's clever, but not really my thing.

I'm also unsure whether the roles help or hinder players.

Great fun, but can be difficult for people who do not enjoy social deduction.  Some people find it difficult to know what to ask.  My sister and I had fun with it, but my other sister and husband did not.  But again, they aren't into the bluffing as much as we are.

Second Comment:  I made this game for my family around Christmas--for a party.  Just played it on the 4th of July with my extended family.  They played with and without me for 2 hours.  Game after game.  They're fussy, but they loved this one and they've played a lot of BGG games in the past.  This is now a 10 (formerly an 8).  I think it's a simple masterpiece.  Well done!

First Comment:  Looking forward to U.S. release.  Made my own quick version out of printer paper and plastic bags.  This game is superb fun for a group of non-gamers.  It's just conversation and guess work.  Rules MUST be followed exactly for it to work.  Otherwise, it breaks.  Also, one person who doesn't quite "get it" may ruin the game a bit.  Even with that person, the game gets funnier.

Keyword here is FUN!  Laughter all over the place.

Social deduction game that breeds paranoia, and manages to do just that with utter simplicity. For me, this easily beats out Werewolf and The Resistance. It's elegant, fun, and easy to explain. It also feels somewhat similar to Dixit in that you are trying to reveal enough information to communicate with everyone else, but not so much as to be obvious to the spy. I love that tension.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
It's a very fun and easy game to play. I find that it's best with 5+ players, giving the spy more chances to take information in before being possibly outed. The rounds go by pretty quickly and just like Who's Line Is It Anyway, the points don't really matter.

I highly recommend it.

I found the game fun, but I wouldn't call it a party game.  The laughs are sporadic (mostly when someone gives an exceptionally vague answer), but there is a fun tension during the game.  I found that after about 10 questions people start running out of ideas for new questions and it kind of stalls out until you get to the time limit.

Ultimately it didn't quite click with the 3 game groups I tried it on.  I like the game, but I think you need the right crowd and people with a lot of creativity.  Props to the designer for a unique game, but I will not be buying it.

Clever game where you have to outwit the other players. It might take a few rounds to get a good feel for the game, and what questions to ask and how to answer them in the best way. You want to give out good, solid information, but at the same time be as vague as possible.

Great party game, but also one of the more difficult ones (Which can be good or bad thing) Being the spy is quite challenging! especially if you're unlucky enough to draw the spy role during your first time to play, like me!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A cool concept with poor implementation in my opinion, results in very samey questions and long pauses while people think of what they want to ask. Perhaps with a more creative crew of people this might be fun, but the slow, methodical pace that results in the spy taking a guess within the first four questions or so is frustrating.

This game is a keeper. It gets to the table quite often in larger groups, where you need to get out a quick and simple game. Encourages engagement and self-confidence, best with people you already know. With quiet people or people you don't know it may get strange. 
Awesome game, you will have a lot of fun playing this. Be aware though to play with the right group - they should be comunicative and open-minded. Sadly, replay value is going down.

This game has the unfortunate bad luck of having Codenames be released right after it. Enough time passed that I'm sure it sold well, but everyone I know that enjoyed this LOVE Codenames, and the people that hated this LOVE Codenames too! I quite like Spyfall and think it has its charms beyond Codenames, but I do think it suffers a bit if you play it a lot with the same people.

The experience of this game is almost entirely dictated by the group you're playing with. 

All too often people clam up and have no idea what questions to ask which can lead to long, silent pauses in what should be a fun, light-hearted conversational game. For that reason it rarely makes it to the table, unfortunately.

Such a fun game. Asking and intepreting the questions is such a blast. It's so simple, yet so fun and addicting and I can play many many games in a row of this. Pretty easy to play with most people.

However! You gotta be prepared to look like an idiot in this game. As the spy, you sometimes just have to take a chance and sound absolutely certain of something that could easily be utterly and ridiculously wrong. This is part of the fun! But for some folks they don't like to get the spy that much because of it.

As far as social deduction games go, this has got to be my new favourite. Asking each other questions to find out who the spy is created a whole new form of meta-gaming in our group. A lot of our current inside jokes originated from playing this game. Haven't had a boring session so far. 

Playing as the spy can be difficult in the beginning, but it gets easier once you get a grasp of the available locations. In my group this forced people to start asking weird, non-obvious questions to throw the spy off. 

The only thing I wish the game would add was a location cheat-sheet for every player, not just the one in the rule book. Luckily, plenty of people thought the same thing and made, and shared, one here on BGG.

Spyfall is a hidden role, deduction game. You get a card (or in our case you click on the app) and you either get a location card with a role or you get a spy card. Then, starting with the dealer, you ask someone a question. The person can answer however they want, then they ask someone else a question.

The spy has no idea where they are initially. Their goal is either to deduce where they are or remain undetected. If they think they know where they are, they can announce that they are the spy and make a guess as to the location. If they're right, they win. Otherwise they have to keep answering questions without alerting the group that they are clueless where they are. At any time anybody in the group can call for a vote to determine the spy... if the group isn't almost unanimous (excepting one person... presumably the spy) in voting for a single person, nothing happens. If the group singles out a single person, then they win or lose depending on whether they've correctly identified the spy.

The game is clever and a lot of fun. It's tricky being the spy as you really have to be cagey in your answers... at least until people are a bit too obvious in their answers. The other players have to try and communicate that they're in the know without tipping off the spy. And occasionally someone will ask a non-sequitur to try and trip up the spy... but that can backfire and make it look like they don't know where they are.

RATING: 6.5
[thing=166384][/thing] is a light social deduction game - one person is the spy, who needs to keep himself hidden, and the others are normal folks that want to expose the spy. The twist of the game is that all players, except the spy, have a function and know the place in which the play is happening - for instance, I can be a Cashier (job) in the Bank (place).

Then one player chooses another to answer something, trying to take informations in order to indentify if that person knows the place everyone is in. However, is necessary to be vague in the questions and answers, as the spy will win if, at any point, he finds out the place they are in. Therefore, both the person asking and the one answering need to not make clear the place or their job, as both can help the spy to identify the scenario - and this condition helps to keep the spy hidden.

There rules are very simple and work well, but, as often is the case in social games, [thing=166384][/thing] needs a proper group in order to really work. By that I mean, first, a large one, since [thing=166384][/thing] is better with 5 or more; and, second, if the players aren't careful and smart in the questions and answers, the whole play can tank.

Still, the main issue with [thing=166384][/thing] is its replay value - as it is a quick game, one that players often play several times in a row, variety is mandatory to keep the game interesting; however, the places tend to repeat, which makes the game lose emotion and attraction.

Overall, [thing=166384][/thing] is fun, being also simple to teach and play, and when it works there can be a lot of fun, with many analysis, plots and laughs. For those that don't like social deduction, you can skip [thing=166384][/thing] interely, as it is mostly more of the same. For those that do like, [thing=166384][/thing] is a hit.

An interesting social deduction game.  I wish the game had come with a list of places for each player instead of one main one, because it can become obvious who the spy is if you just look at who is scanning the places.  It can be difficult for a lot of people to come up with meaningful questions and answers which bogs the game down a lot.  Overall though, it is simple and intriguing fun.

Like all "party" type games, Spyfall will succeed with some groups and fail with others. It really all depends on the group dynamics. With people on the same wavelength, Spyfall should be pretty fun. The questions can be quite tough and it is probably not that tough to suss out the spy. The key issue here is that players really need to know all the locations well when playing Spyfall because if you know the locations in the manual, you have a better chance of guessing the location after questioning. Without knowing the possibilities, it is not possible for the spy to fit in. I find that aspect to be annoying in a party game.

RATING: 5
Simple, but probably too simple, and much too group dependent.  The idea is an interesting one, but the structure is so loose that it tends to be given away.  A lot of this is dependent on when the spy gets asked questions, and how well they can fake their way through it.  The game is fast, but it's not actually very interesting.

Very hilarious game of social deduction by simple questions and answers. It surely has quite a learning curve and need creative social skills among the players but once you get the hang of it, it could be a very awesome game. The downside is the location cards, players need to memorize all the locations so they can really deduct the possibilities when they're taking a spy role.

Storytelling, figure out who is the spy. Requires very specific type of players, and has steep learning curve before you can survive as spy.

RATING: 5
This is less of a game and more of an improv comedy kit. There are scoring rules in the box, but like "Who's Line Is It Anyway?", no one cares. That being said, it is hilarious. I don't think it works well until you've played it half a dozen times, because it is far too easy to pick out the spy when you are learning the ropes. We nailed the spy on the first question, twice in a row when we were learning the game.

Role-playing savvy groups will eat this up due to the clever role assignment within each location. I'm pretty blasé about the whole thing, but that's an extension of me not being a role-player. If you are one, buy this, because you will have a blast. For everyone else, it will always be a hit or miss proposition, depending on your group dynamics.

The thing I love in Dixit is that the game is basically made to make people say interesting things. Here you have something like that. If you don't say enough people will think you're the spy but if you say too much, you help the spy so you have the same kind of two-sided pressure like in Dixit. This will probably stay my favorite hidden role / traitor / social deduction game.

Yes, "very much enjoy playing". It's so simple and so clever... Usually such straight games with minimal number of rules don't have a chance to be rated very high by me. This game does. It's so fun to seek the spy by inventing suitable questions, making more (than single question) complex discussion upon previous questions and answers. Finally it's so intense (heartbeat + 50%) to by a spy pretending to be a part of the whole group.

you really really need the right group of people or a huge amount of alchool to enjoy this (better if you have both). In the only game i played people were just mumbling stupid questions and answers and the scarce fun we had was related to stupid gross sentences, not to the game itself.

RATING: 7
I’ve only played this once before and it was mostly a practice run with three of my co-workers and every play has been through a web implementation. These plays were with my co-workers as well, but they were in person and with seven players (though two people were sharing a phone in order to play, hence why I have it listed as six players).

I love deduction games and I love games that require lying, and this does both. In addition it’s short enough to play a few times and doesn’t overstay it’s welcome. What Spyfall does differently is it’s roles. Instead of just being at the corporate party, you’re the boss, the entertainment, or maybe the unwelcome guest. Those different roles will throw off the other players just enough to keep everyone guessing.

I’m looking forward to this one showing up so I can play the physical version, but the online implementation is fantastic for traveling and the meanwhile.

RATING: 7
This party game is always a smash hit when I bring it to the table. The pace is so high in this game that everyone's always accusing everyone else. It gets really fun once the spy figures out where the others are but doesn't reveal himself and just plays along. There's also a free browser based version of the game which you can play on your smartphone. Try it at the next family BBQ! I promise everyone will want to keep playing it.

RATING: 7
Bluffing and deduction card game. One player is a spy and all the remaining players are at the same location. No one knows who is the spy and the spy does not know the location. The fun begins, the spy is trying to determine the location before the group figures out the spy. Questions and answers are shared in such a way to glean helpful clues without revealing the location and certainly without blowing your cover. Wonderful little game that generates great interaction and entertaining discussions. But, I don't think there is enough content for the price.

Heavily dependent on group, but this one-versus-many game pits a hidden spy amongst a group of normal people. Questions are asked by the group, with the spy trying to figure out where everybody is -- the location -- and the non-spies trying to be vague enough to not give it away. Can be amazing with the right group.

I only own a PnP-version of the game, but I really enjoy this game. Its quick, easy to learn, and everything you want in a social deduction game. Great replayability, expandable and you can easily switch between number of players in a game. A filler that has the potential to be a real classic filler.

After a couple of games I am a little unsure about the game. It has great potential, but there are some aspects that drags it down. First of all its very hard to introduce new players to the game since it's pretty difficult to get into the game (and ask the correct questions). Second it only is really good at like 5 players. With fewer it's pretty hard to be a soy, and with more it's hard to find the spy.

Great game along the lines of Dixit, maybe even better since it's more structured. More locations needed, best played no more than 5 in one sitting. Plays best with 6 and a round of 8 mins, and definitely ignore the scoring mechanism. Plays well even up to 8. One of the few games where being a non-spy is sometimes more fun than the spy.

Fell flat in many different groups I tried it with. Not a lot of game design in it, so be aware that it's all on your playmates whether you're going to have fun or regret obtaining it. I wanted to give it a shot and saw some potential in it, but almost nobody else from a lot of different groups could get into it.
On top of that, the game has also a production issue. I have no idea why the game did not come with the locations summaries for players which are basically essential to play the game. The cost of adding a few simple printed sheets into the game would be like nonexistent.

Pluses?
The graphics are funny and pleasant to look at.

One of the only games where being the spy is stressful and NOT preferred. I would never play with less than 5, but if you get 5 or more, this game really shines. The people you play with however do matter a little. For example, when asking a question, make sure you hand the booklet to them so they can study it as you ask the question. Even if you are NOT the spy, you should look at the booklet. Lest it all boil down to the spy being the only one that looks at the booklet. If you get people to do that courtesy, then this game is a blast.

Wonderful game in theory. This game is all about the people playing and it has flaws inherent to a game that depends on such a x factor. 

This game can make shy folks or those who are self conscious about what they say even more so. This can make the game a more nerve wracking rather than enjoyable experience.

Unlike Resistance where I've seen those types of people get into the theme and invest into the game, Spyfall can make the meta game of exclusion feel too much like actual social exclusion.

So, overall I would rate it higher but there are people who I'm simply not going to enjoy this game with because of my awareness of this and in a social game I'd like something that works with a wider group.

I absolutely love this game. It's fun with or without the optional roles. I do have two complaints, though. First, people have a difficult time coming up with questions throughout their first game. Second, inexperienced groups really need to have multiple copies of the location poster. The spy can easily give him/herself away by looking at the poster too often. This can be somewhat alleviated by forcing everyone to look at the poster when they're speaking. Doing so removes some of the bluffing element of the game, though. Once people have played a few times, this isn't a problem anymore.

Dreadmire was the first Kickstarter project that I backed, as I already liked Xenoshyft quite a bit and I really wanted more of it. Dreadmire definitively delivers that by doubling the content of the line. Even if it's is stand-alone game, I prefer to look at it more as an expansion. 

This product comes in fact with a new set of units and items that you can use with Xenoshyft Onslaught as well as a whole new alien race that you can fight against: the Brood. This new enemy is probably what the game needed the most. While I liked the original Xenoshyft a lot, I didn't find it much of a challenge unfortunately. With the exception of the first few plays, when I didn't yet know the system very well, I consistently beat the game with quite a big margin. The small Hive expansion helped a little but the game was still too easy for me.

The Brood is definitively a different story. First of all I like a lot the new Weather mechanism, if only because it gives a distinctive flavor to this enemy. It also makes things more unpredictable and exciting, as you are never quite sure how hard the turn will be depending on the Weather Card. Most importantly though the enemy cards in the Brood deck are considerably stronger. Even more so for the bosses! If most of the Hive bosses were underpowered in my opinion, these new ones are a serious threat instead, especially given certain weather conditions. For me this is clearly one of the biggest pros of this product.

Another thing that, in my opinion, Xenoshyft desperately needed was some variability regarding the unit cards. In fact, while there was a decent variety of item cards, the units were the same every time you played. I didn't like that and therefore the new units in this box are surely a welcomed addition! Now there's a whole new array of synergies and interactions to be discovered, which adds significantly to the replay value of the game.

All in all I'm really happy with Dreadmire. It turned Xenoshyft from a game that I liked to play occasionally to a game that I love and I want to play much more often. It solved all the issues I had with the base game and added a lot more to it. Excellent product. I definitively recommend it.

Once again I am called to the task of reviewing Xenoshyft, this time "Dreadmire". To avoid a long-form repeat of previous points from my Xenoshyft Onslaught review, I'll list the overarching ideas here:

-The ART is amazing.

-The card design fronts are great.

-The backs of cards/boards/etc are a bit bland but that's okay.

-The Divisions (player classes) are all interesting and diverse.

-The monsters are insanely scary and will mess you up if unprepared.

-The game gets out of the way and lets you just dive in and start playing.

-Teamwork and planning is how you win, not nickel-and-diming the numbers.

-After about 2 plays, the enemies are completely predictable.

-Some of the items are pretty bad, especially the lack of damage to unrevealed enemies.

-Bosses are ...not.

-Everything in this game is on-rails. The waves, the resources, even the unit picks.

-You get Xenosathem (currency) for free at a set amount. No economics, no strategy.

-Terrible quality cardstock. Can be ignored once sleeved.

-Round 1 you get your ass handed to you just like in Onslaught, but thereafter you have basically no problems. This shows a fundamental lack of understanding of when the game should be difficult and is really the product of the bad resource system.

-Too easy. I've never lost a game of Xenoshyft, including when I kept forgetting things beneficial to us.

CHANGES TO ONSLAUGHT:
-The rulebook is MUCH better! Many examples were cleared up and new rules were added for enemy reveal effects, putting bosses in, how many enemies you get per round not just wave, and so on.

-The player powers are MUCH better at evoking their flavor now and do away with on-rails wave based abilities. We probably won't ever use the old ones again.

-The Weather system is nice (if a bit too random and clunky in my opinion) and can drastically change how a turn affects you. It should be adding difficult, but all too often it was just reflavoring the turns.

-The Brood is nigh-indistinguishable from The Hive. The biggest difference is the meta-change of giving more of them "unpreventable damage" (fuck you developers, that's not difficulty, it's just an invalidation of player abilities) and "ignores direct damage" (again FUCK YOU PERSONALLY). Without these gross violations of their own strategic ecosystem, the Brood would be fine. Better even since there are more bosses so you can make the game actually challenging.

-Original game had lower direct damage but most of it worked for unrevealed enemies. This one gives you a TON of direct damage but you have to suffer through most reveal effects. I have no idea how that was supposed to be a change for the better. Now you're pissing off players AND easier.

-Weaker instants. Instants are definitely the reason we win so many games, so I can see why. However, this isn't a "fix" because you're allowed to just use the Onslaught cards. So the designers must've truly decided these were worthy. Sorry, but the instant cards in this game don't even compare to the original.

-Weaker armor. The armors have more abilities but overall, the game significantly lacks increased health.

-MUCH better Wave 1 units. They've added a Ranger clone that's a 1/4 that burns at Wave2+ to reduce Item costs by -2 and it makes a huge difference.

The "7" rating should be a 9 and is hampered by the on-rails experience of the game. Waves make sense for videogames but not for board games. To ramp difficulty, figure something else out. And if you do, don't ALSO make resources and unit purchasing wave-based, because that just counteracts your difficulty ramp.

*STILL* going to hope they release a full-blown variant without the hand-holding in the future. Overall, this game is still a total blast to play regardless of its missteps.

It's much better than Onslaught IF you already own Onslaught. The lack of core-feeling items really brings it down. Buy Onslaught first if you don't own a Xenoshyft game. Just be sure to look up Dreadmire's rulebook instead!

Es una vuelta de tuerca del Xenoshyft original. Tiene algunos conceptos nuevos como las cartas de clima y las mejoras en los cuarteles de los personajes. Además muchas cartas de equipo mejoran en función de la oleada con lo que nunca pierden utilidad al hacerse más difícil la partida con las oleadas posteriores.

En general el juego ha mejorado la formula original y ha optimizado un poco la dificultad. Eso si, sigue siendo tremendamente dificil.

NOTA: Las reglas con la curva de dificultad mejorada son oficiales y compatibles con el Xenoshyft clásico.

RATING: 7
This rating is for both Xenoshyft: Onslaught and Dreadmire. When combined together, you have a very good, highly variable game. Each session will provide a random set of available troops and an available set of items to load out your troops. Both enemy sets provide their own set of challenges. Very good for 1 or 2 players, though you might find it plays a little long. Start with Dreadmire if you only want to purchase one of the boxes. The card text and rules of Dreadmire are improved over Onslaught.

RATING: 3
Man. The system itself is very cool and I love the thematic tension of it. I like the possible card combinations.

BUT: The overall downtime is just too much for me. Do not get me wrong - I like long games and i like very involving ones (like Arkham Horror, like Shadows of Brimstone, Perdition´s Mouth or Galaxy Defenders). But I stopped the time until it was my turn again and with three players total it took 15 minutes to resolve your own combats in Wave 2 and 3. Ant that is way too much. I hoped that buying more cooperative items that they would help me getting over that. No chance. Your cooperation is very limited. Maybe you can play two or three cards on other players during their combat resolution. That is not much in 15 minutes...

As well the game seems to take forever to play. It took 90 minutes to arrive on round 6 and the last three rounds pushed the game into 3+ hours territory.  Enemies heal and respawn at the end of the lane. So the whole system really felt slowing down more and more until the ending.

And sorry, 3+ hours is way too much for me for a number calculating deckbuilder without deep cooperation.

Especially when you have an even more cooperative deck-builder on your shelf like the  Legendary Encounter - ALIEN deckbuilder. That one is much more cooperative, much more thematic than Xenoshyft Dreadmire and has a fantastic pacing.

Dreadmire is for gringing fans and I am really not having fun with that one...by the way - we won on the 4th attempt. So now I am done with it...

I really like the idea of co-op deckbuilders, but this one suffers from the fact that everyone fights in his own lanes, which kills much of the co-op aspect and makes it more multiplayer-solitaire, which I really do not like in games.

2017  Very good tower defense/deckbuilder game, very thematic.  Nice blend of simple mechanics but interesting card interactivy and gameplay.  This game really polishes and cleans up the game system that began in Onslaught, with a weather deck that powers up the baddies and allows them to attack in some creative (and dangerous) ways.
***KS edition includes the Brood and Promo expansions and playmat.  Also have purchased the Nortec, Immolation and Experimental Science expansions.

I ordered this along with the original XenoShyft game (Onslaught). The rule changes are interesting and nice enough. When playing against the Hive, the new rules seem to make the game easier.

The new items and units are nice, especially as an addition to the existing ones from Onslaught. I loved the artwork in general, but the weather cards really impressed me for some reason.

Again, the non-card components are floppy instead of rigid, which I dislike.

The base hitpoints are now counted on a small board rather than a spinning counter. I suppose this is a matter of personal preference, but I like the spinner better.

The new items range from great to stuff you will not like to see added to your deck at the start of the game as its use is too specific to be worth much early on.

The Brood enemy is a lot more difficult than the Hyve from Onslaught. It is also my main grip with this game: when playing solo, the items and units I reveal during set-up for use during the game tell me all I need to know: either I will win by a landslide due to a lot of direct damage, or I will lose by a landslide due to a lack thereof. Strategy has little to do with this. Sure, you can get lucky or unlucky with the weather cards, but if you have enough direct damage, this is easily negated: you can get your units trained to heroic versions and thereby gain more damage control. If you are unable to kill enemies without fighting, chances are you rarely get to keep any units in lane for the next round, limiting your much-needed resources because you must then buy more units. I really do think this enemy was never playtested properly but instead created to be as hard and unfair as possible, with a few units that reward...luck, and a few that are pretty weak. However, the weaker units hardly compensate for the extremely hard ones. With the hard-hitters in wave 3, you stand no chance when fighting; you need direct damage.

All-in-all, I think I like this game as an addition to Onslaught (or vice-versa) more than as a game in its own merit. Without the heroic units and legendary items from the Kickstarter exclusive content, I would consider this game broken and unplayable due to the enemy. As an add-on to Onslaught, it contains plenty of cool stuff. This is the reason I am still scoring it as high as I do.

This is a fun deck building co-op game. Lots of equipment to purchase and the ability to help each other out and trade items that will then go into you deck. There's no card interaction between cards but this might make it easier to understand for beginners. There good variety in the game for both weapon set up as well as enemies. The weather also adds a little variety between games.

Initially I was fairy disappointed with the weather deck as each card simply has 1-3 of the 3 keywords on it, however as we played it became clear that each of these keywords triggers abilities both good and bad on a large proportion of the new enemies and the new equipment, and actually its really really interesting. That ripper eel that gave you a hard time last round in the [COLOR=#0000FF][b]MONSOON[/b][/COLOR] is a piddling 3/2 monster who doesn't do anything now the rain has stopped.

I like the additional equipment and troops and I really like that the player roles have been cleared up and streamlined. Overall a really good expansion that I am looking forward to mixing with the base game for some interesting combinations

Okay deckbuilder. The difficulty level seems unusually high with 2 players. We had a really hard time accruing enough xenosathem to purchase items. We always seemed to have to buy troops to defend each round.

This expansion pretty much brought so much life back into Onslaught. I loved the first game, but aside from small card packs, it needed more. Then comes Dreadmire which cleans up some of the issues I had with the first game, with better rules in certain aspects as well as adding a great weather mechanic to items and more importantly monsters. Great as an expansion and a standalone. If you had to choose one, definitely go with Dreadmire, but owning both makes it that much better.

My main gripe with Xenoshyft is the setup and tear-down due to the amount of cards I have for it now. Still a great game

Note to self: Playable as solitaire. After a video review of onslaught, not sure I really like the theme. The enemy AI deck seems interesting, but coop seems necessary between players, so it might be harder to play as solitaire.

The game is basically a deck builder where you place your troops you wan to use on the board and then you draw X enemy cards and the troops fight each other.

I also don't like how the progression works. The fact that you have 3 waves that affect stuff that you can buy.

I like Xenoshyft, but I find the theme to be very meh. You have space marines that fight aliens with different weaponry, but I couldn't tell you what my favorite cards are off the top of my head. As far as tower defense style games go, this is certainly one of the best. I just find that there are other games I'd much rather play.

Fight overpowered aliens on their home turf.  Blow em' up with grenades, rocket launchers and other cool stuff.  Watch you troops die and your base crumble.  Suitable for solo play with physical copy.  Not sure?  I like it on the IPAD.

A cooperative game that fails to be more interesting when more players are involved is exactly that: A failure. So lies Xenoshyft; a long game when played solo, made interminably so when other players are added.

The removal of other players also removes Xenoshyft's vaunted card sharing mechanic, the only innovation separating it from other similar deckbuilders, leaving it a dull, text-heavy waste of time with an oft-recycled theme.

Love the heroic cards and those extra items. Also weather is a good option. Still suffers from the problem of some of the cards in Onslaught - they are just crap so I never buy them at all. The artwork is excellent. Playmat doesn't work that well if you have sleeved the cards. Really enjoy this one

Just like Xenoshyft:Onslaught but with new cards, slightly clearer rules, and slightly less lucky means for bosses to show up.  So, still awesome and slightly better.  In fact, Xenoshyft can be played using Dreadmire rules to improve it.

Simply incredible. Next to Arctic Scavengers, Xenoshyft 100% stands as my favourite deck builder. The game is dripping with theme, amazing mechanics and variety, as well as difficulty. Such a unique and exciting experience each time I play.

Very hard co-op. Best played with 2p, due to the down time, although 3p is still manageable. I would never play it with 4p.
Get KS copy if you can, otherwise you are missing a lot!

One of my favourite co-op deck builders.  The co-op part of the game really stands out.  As a team, you all have to plan the cards you buy.  The you coordinate how to deploy your troop and equipment cards.  When the aliens attack each player's section of the base, all players may play cards and abilities to help that person out.

I haven't played Onslaught, so I have no idea how this game compares.

With that said, Dreadmire seems great. When Aeon's End came out earlier in the same year I thought we finally had the definitive co-op deckbuilder, but now that Dreadmire is here I'm not so sure.

The thing I really like is how your deck will naturally be thinned during the game, without the need for any cards that let you trash cards. Eventually you can turn every three currency cards from your deck into a single 3-value currency card, and then later upgrade those into 6-value. This happens automatically as the game progresses so you never need to focus on card removal like you do in other deckbuilders. The troop cards have a similar self-replacing ability, where the early troops can be removed from your deck in order to get a discount on the higher-level troops. This all means that your deck stays roughly the same size throughout the game, but the power level multiplies. However, the enemies also get a lot stronger as the game goes on.

The co-op aspect is strong here. There are various cards and abilities that can be used once per round, either to help yourself or your teammates. This adds a great element of risk because if you use all of your abilities helping your teammates, then you might just get destroyed when it's your turn to go into battle.

I didn't use the Heroic Troops yet, but I really love the idea of them. When one of your basic, nameless troops survives a battle, you can upgrade them into a named, stronger troop. That just seems fun, and it gives you incentive to try to keep some troops alive, whereas they're usually expendable.

Really positive on this one after my one play and eager to play again. Will rate after more plays.

Update: Played again and I still really like the game. Unfortunately I wouldn't want to play this with more than three players. My games so far have been with two players and they have easily went over two hours. Each new player would add a lot of time to the game, and even though you can help each other to an extent, there is a lot of downtime.

The difficulty is also pretty steep. We were doing pretty good each time until we hit wave three. It almost feels like the difficulty spike from wave 2 to wave 3 is higher than what your deck can handle at that point. The next time I play I'll either use one of the easier difficulties from the rules, or I'll just add the special items and elite units from the Kickstarter extras as a way to make it [b]slightly[/b] easier.

Overall, though, I still like the gameplay quite a bit. I just won't get to play this very often because of the time and player count limits.

It's not "Broken" in any way. But it takes a significant time to set up and play, and it's not as fun as several games that are far more accessible.

+ Good looking artwork.
+ Fast playing game.

- Extremely thin paper player boards.
- Weird clash between the cartoony art style of the card backs, the player boards, and more mature art style of the game art.

!Difficulty seems weirdly balanced. Some people say its very hard. However every time I've played it, it was all too easy (I havn't been able to find any errors in my plays). 

!!Overall, too generic. Not enough to keep me wanting to play again.

I received the game today. I really hope the game is better then the components. It is a highly overpriced game considering the quality of the product. I would say that other base games with this production value are sold for approximately 25-30$. At the moment I am very very disappointed, but I will return with further comments and scoring when tested.

Dreadmire is an expansion to Xenoshyft: Onslaught that adds an entirely new horde of enemies which exploit weather conditions to attack your soldiers. The difficulty curve has been smoothed out for more regular games, but that doesn't mean the game has gotten any easier! Adds lots of options for new equipment and soldiers (the lack of soldier variety was one of my only complaints about the base game). A fantastic, quick-playing cooperative game with a terrifying theme.

I can't really put a finger on what I don't like. It just feels like a weak offering in the co-op deck builders. I'd much rather play any Legendary Encounters game or Harry Potter Hogwarts Battle instead.
I do like the cashing in cards in the discard for more powerful versions.

Man I'm conflicted about this. I love the theme, I love the mechanics, but it's a long game that really just comes down to luck. I'd call it something of an ameritrash with cards instead of dice. Since you're blind to what you'll be facing there's little you can do to really prepare, and a lot of enemy combinations make for unwinnable situations.

-- Sold: 10/5/17 - Was a tough call, but decided to let this one go.

A really fun game that's as difficult as it is beautiful.  I like the weather mechanic as it adds variability to both items and enemies. Think of Dreadmire as Onslaught 2nd edition.  The division cards have also been streamlined and achieve a much better game balance this time around.

Combined with troops and items from Onslaught, replayability is through the roof!  Loving this solo deck builder.

My initial impression is that this game is harder than Onslaught. I don't think the items are as powerful, and the troops' abilities don't seem as good. However, I do like the game quite a lot. It's a tick lower than Onslaught for me so far.

For me, the dice system of heroes is just not fun. I don't like the bag building here and it feels like there are 'tricks' to be competitive in this system - a trait which I always despise in games - having to know the ins and outs of either some rule slip stream or some gimmick combination which favors those who know the deck of cards better than the opponent.

Age of Ultron has some sweet dice and cool, balanced characters and powers, but I can't help but feel like the redundancy in character choices has gotten a little out of hand with this game. Are we eventually just going to have 36 different options for each of the big characters, for every storyline in Marvel history? I'd prefer a focus on newer characters, and there are a few in here, to be sure, but some of the retreads feel like taking a piss into a stiff wind.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Had enough. If you live near a few people you can trade with, maybe. These releases are just too expensive for what you get out of them. I have Dice Masters D&D, just getting the extra dice to get the 1-4 value cards up to the max of 4 dice to make the game useful is the deal breaker for me. 

That is basically collecting a whole new set of commons and uncommons.

If the starter kit was a better value maybe. Those 2 dice bags are a joke. The rulebook they refuse to rewrite, it is a badly patched phone it in rulebook, when the rules have been changed they cobble it in. 

The so called play mats? 

They added, changed the rules, they couldn't be bothered to updated the playmates, they just tell you to move the dice off the mat. You will find user made mats with the corrected changes, this is sad.

The Start Kit should come in a tin, include the extra die for cards within the full set with a card value of 4 or less. The foil packs filling in the game. This isn't going to happen as it would pollute the secondary market with spate dice and cards and help point put the poor value this game is.

Parts replacement.

This is a one time offer, they make this clear. If the items are lost, you are out of luck, they make this clear.

I had a damaged vampire card from the stater set. I opted not to insure, pay the postage, nor the envelope for a replacement . They require the item for replacement. I can see this for a foil card, not a core set card. I got a 25 cent replacement from CSI adding it on to a large game board order.

Glad I did, I have 3 deformed, oddly same card, from foils I need replacing. Be careful, use your one replacement offer, you get a damaged epic card, you are out of luck. These cards shouldn't be included in that one time offer, they should be replaceable no matter how many request.

Come on, this thing is a huge cash cow.

RATING: 10
Same game as War of Light. I am currently collecting Avengers: Age of Ultron and DC's War of Light. They are the same game. I love the superhero theme. I absolutely love this game and am addicted to it. People erroneously call it a dice rolling fest, but it is not. It's a great game of managing calculated risks, much like American sports, particularly football. I would liken it to Poker mixed with an abstract strategy and/or tactical game. You have your team of guys and gals and go to battle, calculating odds of your opponent's success on his/her subsequent moves. And you weigh that calculation against your own odds of success with each decision you make. But you're always looking ahead to future turns, much like a game of chess, except there is a random component, like there is with Poker. So you make decisions based on your odds. That's risk management. Risk management relates to everything, including litigation. Yes, I am a trial lawyer so I really like the calculated risk taking about this game. 

Of course, my brother and I suck so far. But we are constantly discussing strategy. This game is not that hard to pick up, although confusing at first. But the strategy in it is deep, much like a game of football. The objective is simple, but there are pros and cons to every decision. 

The superhero theme just adds icing on the cake, as I love the color scheme of the dice that represent each individual hero. And I really like the art on the cards.

While I have a lot of characters and a decent amount of dice. I just don't have enough dice to play with standard tournament rules. I can play with those rules, but that would limit my options to fewer characters that I own. So to get the most out of my game, I play with 5 characters, 10 dice, and 20 points. I think strategy changes depending on the amount of dice to point ratio you have. The way we have it so far seems to work like a charm. I didn't want anyone to be able to successfully nickel and dime the whole game to a victory. That kind of strategy is too much luck based, in my opinion. I wanted more margin for error and required thought for well thought out and planned attacks to get those points down. I still might go to 15 points at some point. But for now, we do the full 20 with 10 dice and 5 characters. Even with the amount that I play  with, I have had a match were 19 points were taken in one player's turn to win the game. That game was THE game of Dice Masters games that I've had. The score was 19 to 2. And the winner took away 19 points to win the game in improbable fashion. It was actually quite unbelievable! 

Update: Decided to move to 15 points with 10 dice. It's more balanced, I think.  

Update: Moving back up to 20 points. More skill is required and there are other reasons. Playing with so much fewer than 20 dice makes it really hard to purchase high cost characters. Playing with 15 points makes it nearly impossible to buy them.

We are also going to start mixing in a few tournament rule games since we both have more than enough cards and dice for that. It's just that for a game like this, I want to be able to play with every last card I own if I wanted. And I am very into thematic teams, teams that fit together strategy wise, but not so much like what is done at the tournament or hardcore level. I love theme. I like the idea of being forced to use a pain in the a$$ character who just is not all that helpful in hopes of trying to see if you can work around that weakness. I think that part of the game is awesome! That being said, we are also going to start playing tournament rules with assembling teams for maximum effectiveness, too. We have never really played like that before because we didn't have enough dice per character to assemble a full team.

Consistently poor quality from WizKids is expected:  warped dice, bad paint jobs on the dice, warped cards, wrong index numbers, missing rarity stripes.   Rules have been cleaned up a LITTLE bit, but that's not saying much.  The game is probably pretty imbalanced and luck runs high.

But....  it's still fun to collect and play.   There's just something about it.

I think this is my favorite set so far:

- Lots of 2 & 3 cost cards allowing for many strategies involving early buys
- Few card with global abilities - This is nice for newer players who might be overwhelmed by everything going on the board.
- Synnergies between affiliations allowing for some awesome combinations
- The rule ambiguity seems to not be as bad as other sets (I'm looking at you DC dice masters)

A really great 2 player dice game. The best description is really more or less a cross between Quarriors and Magic the Gathering, which is a fantastic combination. It's fast and possibly the most strategic dice game I've ever played, with lots of great theme and wonderful artwork (not to mention all the gorgeous dice). The only two things to warn about I think are 1) it's collectable, which is sometimes fun but also sometimes irritating and 2) the combat rules can be confusing when first learning the game (in terms of knocked out vs used up). Otherwise it's fantastic.

I didn't know Dice Masters existed until two years after the fact, but it was apparently made for me.  Incorporating the good parts of deck building boardgames with the pre planning of deck building from CCGs and the gameplay of Magic and then blending it together with superhero and DnD themes created a Frankenstein masterpiece.  I love it and Jen loves it.  All our plays are recorded under Marvel Dice Masters: Age of Ultron because that was our first set and we play with all of the sets together.

The asymmetry and direct conflict is a welcome addition to the deck/pool building genre, but adding randomness on top of randomness is a major turnoff for me.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (August 2015)

It took some convincing, but now I like all Dice Master games, I have bought everything but the Yu-Gi-Oh! set. I still feel I relapsed when Iâm chasing super rares all over internet, but Iâm having fun playing the game.

This set offers more of the same, more cards, more dice, however there are new different custom dice for the same characters (Black Widow, Hulk, etc.) so I can no longer mix sets and cards in an indiscriminate way (I used dice from AvX with cards from Uncanny X-men, the dice were the same for the same characters). Iâm not sure how I feel about this but I think I prefer new characters with each set. 

Bottom line, I feel I have fallen into a money pit and I canât see the way out.  I think I will try to get all the cards. The game is fun.

*My play count listed under this set is my play count for Dice Masters overall

My overall rating for Dice Masters is 10/10. I REALLY love Dice Masters. The game and strategy involved are what I love. There's so much variety and combos you can use, so it never gets old. I love that games are quick, and you can adjust the number of characters, or dice to adjust the length of time. I don't love the collectible aspect because it makes playing costly, but the collectible aspect and # of sets that are coming out contribute to the variety that makes Dice Masters so great, so I can't knock that aspect of the game too much.

Meh. Didn't really have any fun when trying this game. The guts seem like a blatant copy of Magic the Gathering, and the dice seem to just add pointless swinginess. I like the concept of dice-building mixed into the game, but the dice-building seems too light to be interesting. Add to this that I'm not a fan of games where you need to buy all sorts of booster packs to try to get good stuff. Hard pass for me.

Dice masters is a fun little game.  It is a bit limited, as it is only 1v1.  It can be fun to buy additional packs (pretty reasonable at $1 each) and expansion sets.  But, the cost can also add up very quickly.  If you enjoy buying new cards/dice and don't mind spending some extra money, this can be a fantastic game.

Over time I really soured on this game for reasons I will not go into.  Not terrible, but a terrible fit for me and my group and any friends who would play it with me.  Took it out of my play rotation and will be trading it on.

The Dice Masters system is much better than you would expect, just give it some time.

Dice Masters is effectively Magic the Gathering meets Quarriors except with a much better theme. Since I cannot stand MTG and Quarriors looked stupid it took a discount copy of the Uncanny X-Men starter set for me to even try this.

Pros:
* This gets better the more you play it and the more cards you own.
* Getting duplicate cards from buying boosters is not as bad as other CCG since you likely need the additional dice.

Cons:
* [b]-1 for the inclusion of female Thor.[/b]
* There are no good cases to really store the game properly. Dice Master's Team boxes are about the best you are going to get, so while they are good for the cards they are just OK for the dice.

I had the chance to check this one out at Essen 2015. Yeah, it made a lot of fun ... dice building with a superhero theme. I just don't want to start another collection.

EDIT: Well, it got me one year later ... I started to collect. Hopefully not as extremely as "Magic".

Fast, tactical play with deckbuilding aspects. Dice for this version of the game are cast pretty well. Cheap boosters, so it's not so much a pain to get what you want. Beat my expectations.

Not played but watched a game. When you compare this to MTG its noticeable both how derivative and how flabby this game is. The dice are pretty but everything else seems slow, convoluted and cumbersome compared to the acme of one on one battle games.

A fun, easy to learn, highly customizable, "dice-building" game, with a hard collectible game edge. The collectible side of this one is a bit easier to swallow than most, however, as the packs are actually pretty cheap.

It's a mix of Magic and Quarriors. Even though you're rolling dice, the randomness of the game isn't as bad as Magic, somehow.

Great tactics and interesting cards throughout the sets. Will be even better as a non-blind product.

Like the previous incarnations of Dice Masters, this is an odd beast. I'm not sure how much 'good play' is a factor rather than collecting super rare and rare cards which on first glance seem to be pretty powerful. I've never really been a fan of the pay to win model and so for me, AoU is a casual game only where I'd supply all the cards and dice and players would just grab some and set up.

Alas, even this is limited with poorly written, confusing rules with ambiguous wording and poor quality control.

And yet, despite all those things, the game is somehow still fun to play. I can't honestly recommend it though.

Update: Absolutely the best way to collect this game is to ignore Rare and Super Rare cards, buy a handful of boosters and the complete your sets online. 

I've also played quite a lot now and being able to put together a few sets to take and play against someone else who has done similar is quite entertaining, but it really has to be played in a light-hearted spirit.

In hindsight, the randomness is moderately controllable, with action dice that allow you choose dice from your bag and re-rolls giving you pretty good odds of being able to field what you buy.

Age of Ultron does a lot of odd things; mostly making the game longer by putting up walls of blockers. A 5 minute game is too short, but a 60 minute game is way too long.

Rating up from 6.6 to 7.5

Further update: The lack of clarity of rules and a seeming complete lack of an FAQ to mitigate the awful WizKids quality control killed off my interest in this game. Once it slips to an occasional game, you spend half your time debating how to interpret the rules on cards. Sold.

Still the same as the previous Marvel Dice Masters, but with new characters and play styles. Comparatively balanced and can be combined with other Dice Masters. Good cast of characters and still fun to play and use as an expansion.

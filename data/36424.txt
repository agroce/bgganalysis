Very interesting and quick. I'm not sure it would hold up to a lot of repeat plays, but I am very interested in playing this right now.

Update: Extremely harsh for new players (think Splotter harsh). Either an overbid or an underbid in the first round of turns can put a player out for good. The game moves along quickly, though. Still not sure whether this will hold up to lots of plays even with experienced players.

I really want to like this one a bit more, but it's getting an average feeling from me because halfway through the game and beyond I felt like the game was almost playing itself. The outcomes of the auctions were mostly clear and the rules just didn't really give me interesting options. I wasn't a fan of the limiting nature of this rule set, despite finding some core mechanics interesting.

RATING: 4
I believe that the scoring opportunities each round are very difficult to have much control over with 5 players.  As for gameplay, I found it repetitive and sort of boring.  If you enjoy Wabash Cannonball, you will probably love this game.  As expected the component quality was awful.  Print-and-play anyone?

I liked a lot of things about this game. The auctions, playing for points instead of money, and train line placement all work very well. Why I don't rate this game higher is the components. They are sorely lacking. The board is a bit confusing. The cities need to be color coded or something to improve recognition and help with determining where lines can start. If I owned it, I would create new stock cards before playing it.

RATING: 8
Initial rating.

Fairly interesting, but some color would have really helped to keep track of the 20+ different shares.  With time, I hope it becomes easier to intuitively know where each share begins.

In a close game, it seems likely that whomever gets the opportunity to build the green cubes will simply win.  Managing this opportunity might be an important aspect to this game.

What a brilliant game. Less sharp than Chicago Express (almost eurogamey in some of its structure: it has Victory points!), show players more clearly what they have to think about, yet the terrain is still quite difficult to find your footing in.

I find it deeply weird that this hasn't found a publisher while Baltimore and Ohio (a much longer and less accessible game) has.

Winsome production has slight problem regarding visualization: not always perfectly clear which companies are available where (I usually place the starting company shares around the board near their starting places, but the ones in the middle can be a bit hard to see). Company that widely publishes this would do well to put a mini-map in every share to show where it starts.

Yeah it's that good.  Mixing elements of share ownership and track building with rules reminiscent of Through the Desert.  IMO, this game totally owns Wabash.

One 2-player game and it played surprisingly well for a Winsome game,  although I suspect it'd be better with more.  It's primarily about advancing your own self-interest while avoiding giving easy opportunities to the other players.

RATING: 7.5
Gulf, Mobile & Ohio is so interesting, I cannot tell you! It includes blocking, like Through the Desert. It involves timing, like Chicago Express. It consists of slow dribbles of opportunities. The best. Celebrities may be my most fun game, but Gulf, Mobile & Ohio is my favorite.

Described by some as Through the Desert with added dimensions, this game calls me in ways the Camel Adventure never could and never will. I'm intrigued by the way the game slowly unfurls and spins off opportunities for profit, by the emphasis on controlling and minimizing those opportunities for the other players. I imagine playing this game to feel like holding tight to handfuls of sand, mitigating losses and scrabbling to hold on to as much as possible. I love the mechanic by which new types of train lines (commodities?) enter the game, and the way they wend through gaps left by their predecessors, resulting in the intersecting variegated trails spawned by Southern burgs. 

The Winsome Games reprint request list includes an entry for Gulf, Mobile & Ohio; I beseech you all to commit to purchase this attractive game!

RATING: 6
A very different take on train games.  You really have to switch gears in this one, as it's not about making the most money like pretty much every other train game.  Since it's about scoring points, the game is very much about spending your money at the right time to score points for yourself, but leaving crappy options for following players.  An odd duck, but still a good time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's a good game, and a good design, but for me, there was a little too much going on visually.  People compare parts of it to Through the Desert, and that's not my cup of tea either.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Surprisingly clever.  Thoroughly non-obvious.  Very emergent.  Opaque.  All good things.  

Not a game of emergent alliances, but of careful timing of money, incentive and tempo.  Who plays when with what money, has what available to them as possible actions and has what interests?  It is a most delicate dance.

Likely better with more players, not yet clear if 4 or 5 is best.

Updated: 4 is good, 5 is clearly not going to be as good, 3 players has some advantages but is also rather more delicate.

Updated: Teaches best with four.  Plays better (tighter, harder, nastier) with 3.

RATING: 6
Good but not great. Rather than reward players for good play it punishes them for making mistakes. The basic approach to solve each turn is to analyze each choice you could possibly make and then choose the one that leaves the worst best move for the next player. My use of the word 'solve' is maybe a bit cynical but for now it feels right.

Gulf, Mobile & Ohio is about dampening one's left-hand opponent's gains to at least the same extent as Puerto Rico, only in that game players are also building unique board positions and there's nothing really like that here. On a related note, I find the entire business with shares and dividends, right down to their existence, to be a lot of pain for no gain. I'm not sure what should have replaced them but they don't seem a good match for the game.

Each of my games so far has come down to a dollar, and in each of these cases the loser could have made choices way up the pipeline that would have given him the game. Arriving at these choices takes rigorous and repetitive number-grinding. It's not nearly the most interesting work to be found in the game, yet it makes up most of the game's playing time.

A frustrating game overall that I think could be really good after a year of additional development.

My first game of Gulf, Mobile & Ohio was a confusing wreck, the only mitigating factor being that we could all see an interesting game through the translucent haze of the game's presentation layer. With the help of a couple of organizational tips, rules we missed the first time, and a bit of experience, our second game was much more clear. For the benefit of other potential players, I'll list the two most helpful changes I made to our use of the components.

1. Rotate both of a company's shares by 90 degrees as its second share is sold. Dividends then become much easier!

2. Arrange the game's initial 8 companies around the board in locations that roughly correspond to their starting hexes' areas. Keep unavailable companies as far away from the board as possible and as they become available, move them to somewhere at the edge of the board that roughly corresponds to their starting hexes' areas.

The biggest problem that remains is the occasional need to check hexes full of cubes to see if there are any companies that be started there. This requires lifting up a bunch of cubes and is really tedious. A similar problem comes when deciding which share to dilute. Here, a player must often first look around the table to match the common stock with the owner, and then look around the board to analyze the value of each selection, which again often requires lifting up a bunch of cubes.

Ultimately, these and a handful of other presentation 'problems' are truly minor, and I'm a little embarrassed now by my early overreaction.

RATING: 8.6
A subtle and strange timing game where the players use auctions navigate (and circumvent) the clockwork.  The value of a share is fantastically rich despite its apparent tractability as a ratio of cash to victory points. 

I've five plays in and still feel very much on the surface of this one and there are some dizzying depths before me.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A game where you try to minimize the points you are leaving on the table for your opponents.  There are some neat ideas here (i.e. not giving the opponent the choice of what color track will build next), and the auction works in the two-player scenario but something prevented it from grabbing our attention.  Perhaps I just couldn't invest the time in the system to see the real potential.  I think there is a really good design here.

In the end it was traded away. I hope it found a good home.

RATING: 8
Related to Wabash in only the most superficial ways...yes, GM&O is a game about buying stock in rail companies and laying track via cubes on hexagonal spaces. Beyond that, the game has a completely different focus. The main goal of this game is collecting VPs which are created when companies are founded, cities are connected, and different colour cubes are connected by the individual companies for the first time. Unlike Wabash, it has no long-standing company kitties, the companies each only have 2 shares, and the income is flat and not based on what is connected, but rather, on whether 1 or 2 shares of that company have been issued.

Like Wabash, the key to doing well in this game seems to be paying very close attention to the turn order and the cash situations of the other players. Unlike Wabash, this is not a game of alliances, in other words, its central focus is off in a completely different direction best labeled opportunism. Each track placement opens up or closes down potential sources of VPs and can cripple or help the different rail companies in that area (i.e.: the one track cube per non-city hex rule can be huge). Carefully playing the cube track (by using presidential expansions, by issuing common shares, by choosing which company will start a new colour track) is critical, as is being aware of the possibilities present on the board.

Controlling the scoring opportunities in this game is delightfully challenging. The green cubes can be a late game score boost of epic proportions, or they can be almost completely useless, depending on the company that is started and the state of the cities.

Overall, it's much too early for me to offer my final assessment on this game. I currently find it quite interesting. It's a touch fiddly to set-up, and it's a bit heavy on the auction, but the game seems to fit together marvelously and the thing really hums when it is in motion. The game is much more complex than it initially appears, or at least it can be if players opt to play it at a higher level. The decision tree is extremely hairy and requires looking ahead several moves to create good scoring opportunities in groups who know how to play defensively. I have figured out how to put myself in winning positions in this, but I have yet to figure out how to cash in on them. Extremely fascinating. At least in the Wabash heaviness category. Factors you should be considering in this each turn include the cube tracks, who can affect the cube tracks with presidential expansion, who has the most money, who has the higher income if dividends pay, what companies can be started, what cities have access points, and what other player's scoring potentials are going to be in at least the coming round.

Seems to play better at a lower scale, with 3 being optimum. This is counter-intuitive because of the number of companies, but seems to be the case regardless. Because this game features a lot of tactical track building, having it take too long for your turn to come up can make control much more difficult. With 3, the system seems to work more effectively for my tastes.

Incidentally: how can you [i]not[/i] love a game that has the S&M railroad?

Through the Desert with stocks, but ultimately much more than that. Timing is everything in this game, and every dollar counts. The trains are fueled by pure self interest, so don't come to GM&O looking for cooperative alliances. Liking this more and more with each play.

Plays two wonderfully. Have each player start with $40.

Exceedingly unfriendly graphic and information design, even by Winsome standards. See the gallery for my [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/635968/gulf-mobile-ohio]complete design overhaul[/url].

Update: Convinced that this works best as 3-player. Or even 2-player, though the rules don't support it. With more players, money is too tight and control is too elusive.

RATING: 6
An interesting Winsome that is not about share holding as much as positioning oneself to score points by buying the right stock at the right time. Fun and different than the other Winsomes, but I very much disliked looking all over the table for where the various stocks were and where the potential start hexes on the board were. Too finicky, but an interesting and enjoyable divergence from the usual Winsome games.

RATING: 7
Unlike most other railway games, GM&O is almost 100% tactical and opportunistic. A good player will devise ploys for coercing opponents into making suboptimal moves. The main thrust of the game is timing things so that you're the one in the driver's seat when it really counts. One of the least annoying Winsome games.

RATING: 6.75
Like many others, my first reaction on playing this was, "What an odd little game!"

GM+O is as much an abstract as it is a money/shares/turn manipulation game.

Railways cannot meet other railways with similar colors, and unless the color with the largest number of tokens left matches another count exactly, players acnnot choose the color tokens they select for a new startup.

Linking to new cities may open up new sets of tokens for others to manipulate and score, but it's also how players earn points, and the cities where more trains/colors meet are where the largest jumps of points are earned.

Money is almost (not quite) an afterthought, because unlike many Winsome games, players win with VP's, not by $$.

I'm starting this at a 6.75; there's definitely some game here, but I'm not certain how long it will take to grok, or even if it will eventually grab me.

What an odd little game!

RATING: 7
I rated this a 7 after two plays, mainly so that my comments would show up in the rating list.  I strongly suspect that this number is going to rise.  The game is fast and tense, which is typically a winning combination for me.


=== Long version

First of all, this isn't what you'd normally think of when someone says "train game."  Calling it "area control" is probably more accurate.  It's highly likely that I haven't come close to grasping the game yet, but it appears to be very tactical.

Every turn you have three options.

1. Auction a share and expand that company.

The winner of the auction uses his bid to buy track, scoring points for cities and competing railraods that are connected in the process.  The winner also gets a certificate that will pay out dividends later.

2. Expand a company that you own the president's share of.

You're guaranteed to get the points (no auction), but you don't get a share in return.  The opportunity cost of this can be high, but it's a useful tool.

3. Pass.

Seems like a waste at first, but it's not always about what you can score on your turn.  You also have to consider the options that are opened up for the next person, based on what you do.  I suspect that this is what JC was referring to when he described the cubes as an auction.  It's kind-of a hot potato. "No, you start this auction."

There are ~25 companies, each with two shares.  8 of them are open at the start of the game, and the rest are available once their start cities are connected to.

The track is represented by 6 different colored cubes, ranging in quantity from 32 to 6 cubes.

When a company build its first track, its color is set based on whatever color(s) currently have the most cubes available.  From then on, that company always builds with that color.  The player who first connects this railroad to different colors gets the points for it.

The map is filled with pinch points, as railroads can only cross each other in cities.  Rural hexes only have room for 1 cube.  Two railroads that are the same color can never meet, making for even more pinch points, walls, and potential for nasty track laying.

As the previously-unused colors are opened up late in the game, some big points become available as these new companies can sneak into cities that have already seen most of the other colors, netting the builder of that track some nice points.

This is not a game where you buy stock and then try to drive up the value of the company while looting the treasury.  You buy the share, becuase of the points that it can give you that turn, depending on the colors available and existing track.  The certificate does give you money later, but the payout does not depend on any company value from the board.  If you own the only share, you get $5.  If both shares are out, they each pay $3.  The winners of both games were heavily laden with shares, giving them good cash flow and the ability to bid large numbers on the end-game builds.  We were all newbies though, and actually accomplishing this with more experienced players is not likely to be easy.


=== Short version

I liked it.  Quite a bit.  Another player and I were still talking about it the next day, and both look forward to the next game.

RATING: 5
Not a bad train game, but not a good one either. 

Somewhat simplistic and I didn't like the fact that the secondary stock buyer has little incentive to actually build track or that their is No advantage for having a particular stock after the stock purchase placement. 
Afterward your stock generates 3 income per turn for any stock, so having a particular stock is irrelevant.

Can't say much of it yet. I was pretty much lost in my first game and failed to see the importance of trying to hold back the possibilities you open for the others when expanding. Very opaque and subtle indeed. Following which company started where becomes annoying as the board gets crowded, should have some chits included to denote starting cities for different colored rail lines. This can get very cumbersome in the endgame.

Money is tight, there is a lot going on here in this auction heavy game.  My first play left me with a good bit of uncertainty about how this game plays out - and no doubt it will play out differently most every time.

Lots of options, but maybe not so many decisions.  It seems like the good options are very constrained by the rules, making position and opportunity more important than strategy.  Need to play again (and bid higher on some things).

Thoroughly non-obvious indeed. This is a strange game, and I'm itching to explore it further. After three sessions, I'm raising my rating to 9, because this game just rocks. I like the way you have to manipulate timing, take care you have the money when you need it, seek opportunities and hope you get lucky. The fact that you're looking for victory points instead of most money makes this one refreshingly different. Clever, clever game.

Enthusiastic.

RATING: 7
First impression (4 players): The game mechanics work well and are straightforward. I especially liked the rule where color of the railway is decided the moment it is first time bought (it is the color where there are most cubes left). You're trying to connect railways to cities and differently colored railways to score points. There are several auctions during the game as there are many companies to buy (even if there is only 2 shares per company) and not a single one of them seems too easy.

The game left me wondering how much you eventually have control over your fate. You can control your spendings to save money for those situations where a company of new color is being deployted. Those can easily be moments when the most points are made if company goes near previously colored railways. I felt that game feels quite chaotic on times like this even if there is really no luck factor. It's really hard to say how you should play the game to play it well. That should be a sign of a good game. My rating might easily rise after a game or two more. It can also go down as well. I was left with quite mixed feelings after the game.

RATING: 5
Its a brilliant concept, but I don't think this is one of Winsome's best games.  I think the shares, money, auctions, etc distract from the the core cube-placement mechanic.  

The game is entirely tactical.  Maybe Winsome's very talented crew can come up with a better game on this principal some day.

Lack of color makes playing this odd game more difficult

Notable for being a Winsome that uses victory points as the in-game currency and not share value or cash. Also notable for being one of the few Winsomes that [i]might[/i] work as a 2p game. It was interesting for sure, but it was yet another game that wasn't as good as the Giants of the Winsome catalog. While we ended up playing New England Railways 5 times, we would simply never choose anything else but Chicago Express or German Railways in the 60-90 minute range. So GMO was a good, compelling, second-tier train game, and at our best we struggled to get our first tier played. So this one, neat as it was, got sold, and unlamentably so.

RATING: 7.5
If ever there were some kind of love child between Wabash Cannonball and Through the Desert I imagine it would be a lot like Gulf, Mobile and Ohio.  Players expand track for points on a hex grid.  Multiple tracks may be the same color.  If that is the case they aren't allowed to intersect.  Of course, you need money to build track and that's where the shares and dividends come in to play.

GMO is rather fiddly and it is difficult to easily keep track of which train company is which.  But it's also a pretty good brain work out.

--Nov2010-- Finally a play!  It's a strange thing.  There's a bit of usability trying to figure out where the various available trains may start, or which blobs of cubes belong to which train.

Plays much different than the other games in the Historic Railroads System because share dilution is a less important mechanism.

Unlike Wabash or Preußische Ostbahn in most ways.  GM&O is a tactical "score when you can and leave as little for others" kind of game.  I could be wrong, but it doesn't seem like there is a whole lot of strategy here.  Most of the time you have to asses what is available to you and make what seems the best move. In most cases this will be clear as it is quantifiable.  Your turn is assessing your earned VPs, how much you are giving to the next person, how it effects dividend's dilution and/or their pay-out timing.  There are certainly going to be choices to make, but in most cases there are bad, good or better choices and you just have to be able to make the proper call.

There is nothing bad here, but it isn't overly exciting. I would prefer to be presented with what feels like should be more real decisions without just testing your skill to cut through white noise.

It's another train game, of course, with some cool twists. The board is nice and simple, so the spartan Winsome style works just fine (even for me!). The map shows southeast USA. There a bunch of cubes in different colors, used to build track. All companies have a director share, and a common share. There are 8 starting companies; the rest become available as other railroads build track into their starting cities (sort of a chain reaction). Players can capitalize (auction stock), expand track (using company money; if you're Director, may use personal cash), or pass. Shares pay $3 each (unless only director share out; then, it pays $5) whenever dividends are paid; which occurs after every 2 sales of common stock -- interesting timing mechanism! The other interesting thing is the way cube colors work. There are a BUNCH of different companies, but only a few colors of cubes. When you start a company, you must build track using whichever color cube is most available in stock, and cubes of a color may never be adjacent to cubes of the same color from other companies. You get VP by connecting companies to cities, so there's incentive for everyone to go there -- but they can't because their cube colors may already be present!

I think this is my favorite game from the Essen Set this year!

RATING: 5
Found this very annoying to play to the point that I have not yet been able to perceive what might be interesting about it.

Tons of auctions over god knows what, a 46-card share deck (for 23 similarly-named railroads) that potentially has to be laid out individually (half of them potentially having a cube on them), and a board that is hard to read and may even be theoretically ambiguous (six track colors for 23 lines, many of which have multiple possible starting locations).

It's clear timing is important: Not my favorite thing. Also has the thing I don't like where auctions occur by people spending their turn to cause one.

The opening move is literally scripted (mandatory), and as the game is luckless and without hidden information, the scripted feel surely propagates to later turns. Maybe that's the appeal? Or at least how the game achieves some focus?

As a shareholding game it is a bit odd that dividend payouts (and thus the value of a share in terms of cash) are not influenced by the railroad's performance. Building track is only useful for scoring VPs.

Will try photocurio's variant.

An interesting system, but the game fell a little flat. It is not clear there is much more to it than making sure to have the most money at the precise times the best scoring opportunities come up (mostly, when a new color is available).

Based on one play so far:  Great game in the line of Wabash Cannonball.  There a variety of interesting decisions to be made.  One of the players noted that this game was sort of a "through the Desert" on steroids.  That seems to be a fairly apt description if not all encompassing.  Elements of area control, cube placement and resource control make the decision making process at times very tricky.

GM&O is quick and has a lot going on for such a simple system.  Enjoyed it a lot even though I came in dead last my first play (but I know exactly what I did wrong after misunderstanding a rule).  Another excellent addition to the Winsome line.

[i]tl;dr -  Kolejka is a solid mess-with-your-neighbor game that also does a pretty great job of teaching about the time period it covers. This game is much better than I expected.[/i]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

Wow, I'm actually shocked! Kolejka is a game made by the historical institute of Poland, designed to teach school children about what life was like under Soviet influence. It achieves that goal admirably, but I was floored to find out that it's also a really solid worker placement game. 

The rules are simple, but you'll want to teach them aside from the rulebook, which makes everything seem far more complicated than not. In short, you all are lining up at various stores, trying to acquire different groceries for your shopping list. Each turn, some deliveries will be announced to a certain store, and then you will each use the 'line-jumping' cards in your hand to manipulate the various lines and try to get in the best position to walk away with the goods you need. The first person to get all ten goods off their shopping list is the winner! 

Overall, this is a sweet surprise of a game, for two reasons. First off, this is a nasty little competition, where everyone is manipulating all the lines, and you'll find your every move stymied by your neighbors. But that's OK, because you're messing with them as well! The game is over in half an hour, so it's not like your grand strategies come undone -- it's just a good, simple cat fight. 

Secondly, this is a surprisingly effective teaching tool. Having lived in the former USSR, the "funny" tactics on the line-jumping cards really reflect reality and the tough situation that many in the USSR, and its satellite states, faced. The rules book also includes several pages of information about the time period, which would be extra effective when using the game as a teaching tool. 

Unfortunately, Kolejka is only available from the publisher, and with shipping from Europe to the US, it's a little overpriced. But the PNP is also available, which is how I've assembled my copy -- it's left me wanting the published version!

RATING: 7
Whenever I see the phrase "a game that needs to be played in the right spirit" I figure that there is something wrong with that game, some flaw that needs to be excused.  Well, Kolejka is a game that needs to be played in the right spirit. Played as an optimization exercise, its randomness and chaos will inevitably disappoint.

What Kolejka does have in its favour is fantastic fidelity to its theme of queuing for consumer goods in Soviet era Poland.  There is uncertainty about whether a shop will have any goods to sell and, if so, whether they will be those you expect.  There is a black market at which you can trade junk you don't need for something better at a poor exchange rate.  And then there are all manner of underhand tactics to get your meeple to the front of the queue and frustrate other players.  It's not deep but it is light, immersive and fun.

Kolejka's artwork is wonderfully East Block drab, from the crumpled brown paper parcel look of the box to the ugly goods in the shop windows.  The rulebook, featuring period photos, is splendid.  Production quality is excellent.

Very thematic game with a fun factor. Our game ended a bit in an impasse : In the second week all deliveries ran out and only one shop with stuff was open (and blocked for stocktaking) and there were not a lot of goods on the black market. Allthough the goods are scarse, they were very scarse. Some more goods cards should have been better.

I finally got to play this one.  Very tactical but along with that, since you know everyone has the same cards, you can pay attention to what may or may not happen.  Some nasty take that (which it's hysterical when you shut down a store others have been waiting in line for days to get a purchase).  The theme is VERY strong in this one.  We played with six and had a blast!  I feel it does need max players in it.

RATING: 6
A decent super-filler type game of waiting in line.  How's that for a fun theme!?!

Your goal in the game is to obtain a set of 10 items, which can only be obtained by waiting in line, hoping the goods show up, and that you're far enough ahead in line to get those goods when they arrive.

First, players place their people in line.  On the first turn, you will place all of your people in line.  On subsequent turns, you might have no one to put in line if they're still all standing in line from the previous turn.  There are several shops: furniture, food, clothing, etc, all with their own line.

Then it is revealed what stores are receiving shipments, and how many goods are in those shipments.  Yes, it's possible that you may have gotten in line at a store that received no shipment.  Too bad!  You'll have to wait even longer.

After that, players play cards (you have a hand of 3) to mess with the situation.  You'll line jump, find out that the shop you're waiting in line for has actually closed for the day, sneak off with goods before the store opens, etc.  Basically, chaos will ensue before the jostling is over, and hopefully you're in position to come away with something.

Finally, players get goods for being in or near the front of the line in the right stores.  For example, if there are 3 goods in the store, the first 3 people in line will each come away with one.  If you were 4th or further back, too bad, you'll just keep standing in line until tomorrow.  And maybe the next day.  And then maybe the day after that.  And perhaps the next day as well.  Who knows when the next shipment will come...

Overall, the game is light and fun, if maybe a little chaotic and frustrating at times.  One I would play sparingly if others wanted to play.

The theme is great and well implemented – because it really felt frustrating and depressing to play… And it sure must have been standing in line in grocery stores in Poland during the Cold War… Yes, that’s right, that’s the theme of the game! We did get a laugh, but that was mostly because the game was so bad and pretty damn random! It was actually an awful gaming experience, but the social context (playing the game on a con at 4 am) made it quite funny. It waaaay overstays its welcome with 5, even though BGG finds this is the best number. It would probably have been a fine game for 30 minutes, but not for 100! Yes, maybe it’s an educational game for teaching young Poles about communism and such, but that doesn’t make it a good game – in fact on the contrary, it seems.

I do like that the winner was the first one to get a 10 commodities (instant winning conditions are always cool I think). In order to get those goods, you place meeples in queues – and hope that there will be enough of that commodity when it’s your turn. But you can change the order of the queue, jumping ahead in the queue etc., making it feel a little like Guillotine, but without any of the fun elements and the fast gameplay! It’s always random which commodities/goods appear in which round, and it’s just too hard to have any control over what happens. Those cards alters the situation too much and it’s hard to plan ahead as the queue can change quickly. And even when you finally get to be in front of a queue where there is actually a commodity, another player might simply shut down the market that day and you get screwed! Oh and the cards vary quite a lot in usefulness, and as you only have 3 out of 10 or so each day (iirc), you are really at the mercy of Lady Luck as you need to draw the right cards at the right time. And hope your opponents don’t. 

The scores were very tight, and the owner of the game said that is usually the case – but is that necessarily a good thing? I’m not sure, because then it seems even more so that it’s random who eventually wins. I am pretty sure that I don’t want to play this game again, and maybe I’ve been too generous rating it a 3.5…

I absolutely adore this game for being able to take something as mundane as lining up for goods in 1980's communist Poland, and making it into a fun and accessible game. It's perfect to get out with non-gamers - I've tried it now with a few family groups and all of them loved it.

It's also just incredibly charming and thematic, which makes it so much more enjoyable to play. Lining up the little wooden people tokens in front of the shops, competitively jostling them around and then ultimately sending them home with little goods cards which all contain photos of appropriate 1980's-esque homewares and supplies. It's beautifully made.

This one will stay in my collection forever.

If you consider that Kolejka was released primarily for educational purposes I think it's pretty much a success. The despair when arriving at an already long queue, the scarcity of goods, the absurdity of the system, and the various shortcuts to still acquire that which you need to get by; the game brings all that to life fairly well. Being subjected to an arbitrary, everchanging set of rules isn't particularly endearing for a game, however, outside of the educational context.

Definitely worth playing once for the emergent theme (e.g. the smooth segue from standing in line for the things you want most, which we did at first, to standing in line for stuff you don't want because at least the line is short).

The game woven into that theme is light and in the CDG vein; everyone has the same deck of unfair line-jumping cards and once you know the cards you can strategize around them. But the emotional simulation is the reason to play.

Kolejka is an amusing little game with really nice graphic design. It captures the feel of its unique theme quite well (standing in lines in communist Poland waiting for food, clothing, and other goods). It's a tongue-in-cheek look at this grim time in history, but it still feels a little bit depressing and cynical to play.

Players have a group of wooden meeples they will use to try to be the first in line at the various stores. Using cards, they will shuffle these people around, jockeying for the best positions. Multiplayer chaos abounds, as a player is more likely to accidentally hurt you than to do so deliberately. Managing the cards in your hand is interesting though, as you only get 3 per round, but unspent ones return to your hand for the next round. All cards eventually return, but a player who overextends early may be at the mercy of other players later. 

Largely, this is a forgettable game in terms of mechanics. But its theme is so well-integrated and unique that it's hard to dismiss it right away. Probably worth playing, but not one that is likely to have much longevity. Games that border on the educational often suffer this same fate.

Wonderful presentation and very neat marriage of rules to theme.  A bit of chaos with how the cards play but that is mitigated some by the rather short playing time.  I believe it will see playing time with some of our non-gamers friends since it's rather approachable and quick to play.

RATING: 7
This game is all about theme (10 out 0f 10), but the card play adds a great element of excitement to the game. It's pure chaos - not very strategic. It's great with 4 or 5, because it's tons of fun to screw everyone over. As a 2 player game I'd give it a 5. I haven't tried 3, but I can't imagine that it's much fun.
Excellent graphic design - which is helpful in showing how to set the game up.
Even with Polish as a second language, the instructions were pretty simple to follow.
Includes a DVD with 1 terrible film and one good. :)

A little boring, too much downtime between moves.

Update 2015: played again recently with 4 players who all knew the rules well. It went very quickly and was a lot of fun- how it was intended I think. Our first few plays were perhaps marred by an AP prone player that took it a bit seriously. Upgraded from 6.

Overall game design looks good, the components quality is also good, but it lacks diversity - it gets boring really fast, because of very limited number of both item lists and action cards, every play feels the same.

But if you're new to board games and, by a chance, grew up in 80's/90's in eastern europe it would really suit you. Also it makes some parents really nostalgic.

Objectively, this a terrible game. There are no real decisions to make and results come down to everyone playing a bunch of take-that cards. But Kolejka is unique in its unusual theme and its fidelity to what is probably to most an unexciting simulation. This has to be one of my favorite themes I've encountered, and the graphic design is superb. The artwork is very attractive and the production quality is excellent. I see this more as a work of art than a game.

There's nothing all that innovative about this game. All it is is putting your workers in various lines and waiting for scarce goods to come up. But the take that cards are fun and yet not so mean as to turn people off, while the limited supply forces a playing time that's not too short and yet doesn't overstay it's welcome. The theme of waiting in line in Communist Poland is just fantastically realized, including the cute touch of the black market. I've had nongamers watch a game in progress and regret they turned down playing. I really like this game for what it does.

This is a nasty game about standing in line and trying to cut in line, change the order, etc.  there is strong potential for king making.  The speculators can maked life painful as well if they grab too many goods which prevent you from acquiring what you need.  Can't decide if this one gets another play or not...it does what it sets out to do fairly effectively, just not sure if I enjoy that effect.

Finally a worker placement game that I enjoy! Although strictly speaking I don't think this is classified as a Worker Placement game at all, more of a working standing around game. For you see, this game is all about standing in line. Sound fun, doesn't it? Well in Kolejka you relive the experience of being a family in Poland during the Cold War. Everything was scarce and you had to stand in line for hours/days to get anything you may need from clothes, to food, to consumer goods. This game was designed and originally made for a Cold War museum in Poland and later sold off to a true game publisher so demand could be met. The first thing that strikes you when you open the game is how well the game is designed graphically. The illustrations are fantastic, and even the many language rule books have perfect choices when it comes to fonts and layout. The icons on everything are simple and beautiful. Overall one of the best graphically designed games I have come across in many years. The game play is easy to pick up and quite hilarious. Those who play will have a hilarious time shutting stores, using someone else's children, and finding community lists that will change the order of lines at one of the five stores. Hand management is key to winning the game. The game also plays really quickly with games lasting no more than hour. Overall I would say this is nearly a home run. I do wish that there was a way to make the shopping lists more specific instead of 5 food items, 4 consumer goods, etc. Instead I wish they had less variety of items for each store, and made your shopping list more specific (i.e. a television, a chair, canned beets, etc.). All in all I would say this is a great game if you can pick up a copy.

An educational game simulation "going shopping" in Communist Poland, which consists of waiting in line in front of stores that might not even get any merchandise at all. There's no reason to think this should be a tense, fun, or even good game, but it totally is. It does such a good job of delivering the experience that you feel kind of guilty enjoying the hell these people had to endure on a regular basis. Absolutely wonderful in the physical and mechanical design. I wrote more about it [url=http://www.daveexmachina.com/wordpress/?p=8646]here[/url].

Nice little set collector/take that game.  The theme obviously adds a lot, but I'm not sure the designers would approve of all the joking about bread lines being thrown around as we played.  Its hard to take this game as a serious learning tool about the tragedy of Soviet control of Poland when the cards make it so silly.  Much better than I expected after I read the rules.

RATING: 6
A surprisingly funny insight into the daily life of the soviet-polish familiy in their quest to fill the weekly shopping list. Only problem is that the shops in the worker's paradise didn't exactly have full shelves. So each day you send your family members out to queue in front of the stores that sell what you need, and hope that today is the day where they get supplies.

Graphically, everything is very well done, with a drab colourtone that really underscores the theme - even to the point that the rulebook is layouted as a polish rationing book.

The core of the game is queueing and manipulating the queues, to get yourself to the front or deny others what they are standing in queue for, via a set of 10 actions that have to last you all week. Screwage is a major part - done very much in-theme.

As my polish skills are sadly lacking, I benefitted much from having a pole explain the mechanisms to me!

The game I'm sure is accurate in creating the feeling of Peoples Republic of Poland but it doesn't make for a great experience. 

It was created as an educational game by Institute of National Remembrance of Poland. It looks ok, it has nice board and components (meeples and cards). The mechanics are fine. Everybody gets the same deck of cards (and draw some of them) and it seems that everyone gets the same chances.

Every game day you queue to empty shops and sometimes they get some items. Then everybody uses their cards to get in front of the line. And some of the cards will move the items from one shop to another and all you work will be wasted. Whoever gets their set of items first wins.

In the end a random person often wins. There is no feeling of accomplishment. It feels like apart from that one person every one person everyone looses. And that's Communism for you - I dislike it almost as much as this game.

Tough to find now.  Had to order the Polish version from Poland.  Not a problem though as the full instruction booklet and card translations are available on BGG and the manufacturer's site.  Plus the only text in the game you need to worry about are on the 7 queue cards you have and thanks to the great pictures on them you'll quickly remember what each do.

First off, the aesthetics are wonderful.  My wife is from Poland and everything from this game reminded her of her childhood, from the real products from the 80's featured on the product cards to the special ability queue cards that you play to reorder the queues.  This is a very good looking game that immerses you in that era of Polish history.  Kudos for that.

The gameplay is fairly straightforward, move your meeples into a queue for different types of goods and different stores to match the shopping list card you have for the game, turn over a few delivery cards to see which stores will be getting things to sell that day.  If you're in line and there are enough goods, you get one.  If only it were that simple!  Everyone has 3 queue cards in their hand at a time that they can play after the deliveries are revealed that will let them mess with the queue order or products.  Move products from one store to another where you're first in line!  Move to the front of the time, move someone else back, etc.  Each card is based on things that really happened in 1980's shop queues in rationing Poland.  Play the card: mother with small child card and you go to the front of the line.  However, your competitor may play a card that accuses you of talking bad about the communist party and you're moved back two spots, only to have another player play a card that says today's shipment of chocolate was accidentally delivered to the furniture store instead (a common occurrence in 1980s Poland)

The game plays fast and smoothly with enough depth to keep "gamers" happy while also making it a great game to bring around to parties or dinners with non-gamer friends.  I can't imagine not taking this game with me to a friend's house for dinner due to subject matter, ease of play, but also depth involved.  And to think this game was commissioned for a Polish museum gift shop!  Awesome!

What makes this a 9 rather than 10 for me is that I see a couple of miss opportunities where the game could have been a little bit deeper without making it more difficult.  However it is certainly fun and I'll be sure to make everyone I know play it with me and my wife at least once!

I also have the Ogonek expansion.

Standard 2 player is a nice quick 1 hour queuing romp, with the option to play 2 colors apiece for the longer brain burning 2 hour session.  Playing cards to help both of your colors opens up a lot more combos.  I almost want a card for team based play - maybe "Trade (or give) 1 item with another player".

I don't agree with other folks who say that this game isn't cutthroat.  I think it's much more cutthroat than the standard euro fare of resource denial.  You'll definitely feel the pain when you've burned 2 of your 3 cards to max out your folks in a queue, only to see an opponent play a queue reversal card and spoil your plans.

This is a unique game in my collection, and I purchased the expansion as soon as I could.

A game about queuing with backing from the Polish government? Um, sign me up. I had my hesitations about this one but the theme is done very well and the art is great. Who wouldn't want to play the role of the proletariat in communist Poland? 

Basically it's a set collection game where workers are placed at the end of various lines hoping to receive rationed goods. There's also a line for the black market where goods can be traded. Game play is through cards that allow queue, goods and delivery manipulation.

Other than that there's not a ton going on so replayability may be a valid concern. You also, need to be ready to be screwed over. It's not really a take-that game but it does require you to affect the position of others. This may feel unfair at times but we must remember what the theme is. Overall I'd say the designer of Kolejka accomplished what he set out to do.

Horrid.  Just horrid.  Think guillotine with a board and a far longer playing time.  Here is how the game plays:

1) make strategic placements of people in a line in order to gain commodities to meet list conditions
2) doesn't matter; afterwards cards are played to reorder or completely inverse line
3) Doesn't matter; get some commodities but cannot collect full list.  Not enough commodities for trading line to matter, especially at 2 to 1 return.  Game ends with nobody meeting list conditions.  Most commodities depleted, remaining shops are closed each round due to cards so commodities aren't drained and game continues until one person vomits and must excuse themselves.
4) 1.5 hours have passed.  Depression sets in.

If they were attempting to mimic the experience of communist era Poland, they succeeded.  Never want to experience that again.

I don't enjoy standing in a queue, but this game makes it fun! There is a LOT of "take that" and the art work and sense of humour throughout this game match the theme well.

Now this is clever.  Good game and superb theme.  Place your workers in the shop queue and see what gets delivered and how you might actually get something you need.  Really enjoying some Polish designs, well worth trying out.

Solid game design, somewhat on the lighter side, with excellent visuals.  Familiarizing yourself with the action cards is a must.  Replay value is probably low.  Makes me yearn for a device that could inflict 1980s Poland on right-wing trash who casually throw around the word "Communism" when discussing the minimum wage and so forth.

Gioco con ambientazione spettacolosa! Ogni giocatore deve lottare con gli altri per accaprarresi i beni richiesti dalle carte obiettivo. Ci troviamo in Polonia ai tempi del comunismo e Kolejka vuol dire 'Coda'. Dopo aver mandato in coda i componenti della propria famiglia i giocatori potranno usare qualunque mezzo, lecito e non, per superare la fila, alterarla, superare il vicino, il tutto per prendere quel prodotto che tanto desideravano. Il gioco è molto ironico e spassoso grazie a carte spiritose. Non manca comunque una buona componente di strategia e pianificazione. Splendida sorpresa grazie alla presentazione di Rotilio.

RATING: 7
Hardly ever seen an educational game that is actually fun, Kolejka was a great suprise. Very nice graphical appearance and thematically very interesting. 

Not that much complexity though in my opinion, not really a strategic game, but a lot of malicious joy to experience when you spoil your opponents moves. And all the randomness of wether you get anything or not actually tells the story of Kolejka. Really nice idea but you get used to it quickly.

Just by mechanics I would probably not play this much anymore as it ends up having a lot of take-that mechanics that are just somewhat random. 
It just has this really quirky historic interesting theme that just fits the gameplay in a way that makes it an interesting experience again. 
So based on that connection it actually stays on the shelf for now just because it brings out that theme so well.

It's like a board game version of Guillotine, playing cards to get to the front of the queue (to pick up goods you need to win), but there are 6 simultaneous queues you want to manage. It doesn't unfortunately bring Guillotine's sense of fun and appropriate time length, implementing a turgid "shopping in hard times" theme and turning it into a 60 min long game featuring take-that mechanics and consequent king-making. While it was ok as a one-off, it felt explored after one play, and it didn't generate enough fun or challenge for me to want to play again.

More gameplay than it looks to have at first, this is more than just a tie-in game.
Only played with Poles, many of whom it brings back memories for and that undoubtedly adds to the gameplay, there's some real take that aspects to play.
Downside would be a slight tendency to jam up in the end game but that might be our gameplay approach

I really like the idea and aesthetics of 'the Polish queuing game', but I'm not convinced I'll want to play it much. It achieves its educational aims of evoking the hopelessness of the queuers and the capriciousness of the system. But once you've experienced that, I'm not sure there's much gameplay to keep you coming back.

As I lived in Poland during communism reign and as a young boy remember queuing together with my whole family for everything, even basic food, this game is very close to my heart, very nostalgic. It is also very fun, I love the thematic fluff texts on all cards. Chaotic, but that is also thematically correct - you never knew what will be available to buy in stores.
However,the whole mechanism of collecting sets is not my pair of shoes.
For gamers 6, for family 8, so I rate it 7.

--Feb2013-- Strange Kafkaesque game of lining up to acquire a set of rather strangely banal goods.  With some inter-player screwage.  It's an odd mix of historically educational, light, and disturbing.  I'm very happy to have played, but don't know that I'll try too hard to repeat the experience.

RATING: 7
100% szocializmus az asztalon. Nagyon örülök a magyar kiadásnak (ami nem teljesen hiba nélküli ugyan, de az külön jóság, hogy magyar árucikkek kerültek bele).
Teljesen egyedi téma, kiemelkedően jó megvalósítással. Az kevésbé meglepő, hogy mindez lengyel barátaink fejéből pattant ki. Az, ahogy megcsinálták, már annál inkább!
A modern kori játékok közt igen jól működik, de engem a nagyon erős tematizáltság, és az olyan apróságok hódítottak meg, mint pl., hogy a tábla hátulja "gyárilag pecsétes", vagy, hogy a játék előkészületek azzal kezdődnek, hogy "A játékosok mossanak kezet!". Arról nem is beszélve, hogy a szabálykönyv külön történelmi ismertetőt is tart, korabeli fotókkal.
Igazán jól 4-5 fővel működhet a társas, 2-vel eldöcög, de többen mindig jobb. Nyilván viszonylag nagy a szerencse szerepe (ebben is jól leképezi a letűnt időket), sőt akár káoszosnak is mondhatjuk.
Leginkább a Guillotine nevű kiváló filler jutott róla eszembe (némileg félek is, hogy ezt a játékot is "ki tudom égetni", ha sokszor kerül az asztalra). Egymás kárára próbálunk ott is előre törni, szintúgy itt. A tolakodás fázis egészen egyszerűen zseniális például!
A szabályok nem adnak mindenre letisztult választ, de a készítők szándékai alapján könnyen egyezségre juthatunk a vitás kérdések esetén. Ennek ellenére futhatunk bele olyan helyzetbe is, hogy a játék brokenné válik (nem nyerünk, de azt el tudjuk érni, hogy a többi játékosnak se legyen erre esélye).
Hosszát tekintve talán lehetne rövidebb, de mindezek ellenére úgy gondolom, hogy aki nosztalgiával tud emlékezni a rendszerváltás előtti korra, annak nem árt egyet birtokolnia ebből a gyöngyszemből.
Az újrajátszhatósága azért némileg kérdéses.

Worker Placement done right.  Very enjoyable.

Oddly enough, the artistic approach manages to have a spartan, dingy communist Poland vibe and an indescribable richness simultaneously.  I'm not sure how they did that, but they did.  The rule book feels like something you'd get at a Getty Museum fund raiser.

You can really screw your best friend in this game, and that's laudable.

RATING: 5
You have to admire a nationality that can laugh at their misfortune. I can imagine that there would have been a few inside jokes about queuing for a shortage of goods in the day. This game takes that humour and does a noble job of bringing it to cardboard and wood. Players queue and bump each other around in queues for five categories of goods. All the best shopping plans can and will go awry. All is driven by an identical ten card deck that players must ration over five days, maximum of three cards a day. Close shops, bump yourself up a queue, bump others down a queue, reverse the queue order or just close the shop for the day. It's chaos, but chaos you can laugh about (mainly because it's not real). Ham it up and have a good laugh. The mechanic is delightfully simple, quick and effective.

My only concern with the game is that games might start to feel the same quickly. After one or two outings you'll have explored the possibilities. Not a problem for some, but for me I'm interested in something with a little more staying power that I can explore a lot further. Probably underrated by me. Worth a look for a light fun gaming experience.

Gra w założeniu ma przybliżyć (niektórym przypomnieć) realia jakie panowały w życiu statystycznego Kowalskiego w czasach PRL ...i zadanie to w jakimś sensie spełnia, ...a że przy okazji jest trochę śmiechu... "Komuno wróć" chciało by się rzec.

"+" za wykonanie, mechanizm, jedyny i nie powtarzalny klimat i przede wszystkim za cenę - 39 zł (przynajmniej w założeniu i dla niektórych szczęśliwców)

Nehéz erről a játékról mit írnom, mert a témája a gyerekkoromat idézi és akartam szeretni, de sajnos nem megy. A játékosok boltokhoz rakják felváltva a figuráikat, ahova véletlenszerűen jönnek áruk. Minden játékosnak a célkártyáján 10 árufajta van különböző eloszlásban fajtánként. Ezeket kell beszerezniük. A sorba való bejutás után felváltva tudunk egy körben maximum 3 kártyát felhasználni, amivel befolyásolni tudjuk a sorban állók helyzetét, miután ezzel mindenki megvan, az árukat sorban megkapják az ajtónál állók. Egyrészt unalmas is a játék, másrészt nagy a szerencse szerepe. Nem tetszik az azonnal vége megoldása se. Olyan kicsit, mint a Munckin, azaz mindenki eljut szépen 8-9 áruig, utána pedig valaki véletlenszerűen nyer, attól függően, hogy éppen kit nem tudnak akadályozni a többiek. Adja magát, hogy sokan kellene játszani, de lehet kevesebb játékosszámmal lenne benne potenciál. Dicséretre méltó a doboz és a szabálykönyv. Elsőre nagy csalódás volt.

By staying true to its Soviet-era Polish shopping theme it demands players cope with frustrations, disappointments and the quirks of the system. You queue, but you don't really know if or when deliveries will arrive. You can use your influence, your privileges or your elbows to manipulate the queues, but everyone is doing that, and maybe the other players have more influence than you today. Of course, tomorrow may be your day, but then tomorrow may be the day when deliveries go astray. Bartering with the Speculators at the street market may be more productive (though more expensive) than queuing at the official state-run shops.

Superb artwork and style. Excellent, thick-papered rulebook with historical background essay (& photos). Even a DVD. But currently only in Polish. English translation available on bgg, and playable with a small cribsheet (translation of 10 cards)

Having tried 2 & 5 player games, I'd say the more players the better.

As an educational tool, this works pretty well in that it works as a game and does seem to convey the frustration and chaos of shopping in the period it's set.

As a game, it's not[i] such[/i] a success, but it's far from a failure. It's pretty chaotic, the order of which you draw cards is massively swingy and it wasn't deeply involving as a game. It was fun to play though and the artwork is pretty, if minimalistic and slightly home-made feeling.

In summary; if you're okay to play a take-that heavy(ish) card game with heavy random elements, it's perfectly decent.

I like the game alright, and the social commentary that it creates is interesting.  I'll play it if I'm in the right mood or the timing is right.  It does play fairly easily, and is basically easy to teach.  A bit of luck in the hose your fellow player round, and just a fight to get the relatively few items that actually come to market.

Seems to be 5 player only, as it just feels to free with less.  It's an alright game, but I don't think it's great.

Can't say anything bad about the game's mechanics or the quality  of elements. For some reason though, the game is boring and our gaming group can't grasp where all the hype and "charm" of this game is coming from. Perhaps, because we remember those times, the game isn't that much funny to us ? All in all, this is a game I would personally play last (if at all) during a game meeting.

Well themed entertaining light family game. Pawns queue up at shops, but the main play is in the action cards that allow you to perform 'take that' plays against your opponents. However, as you all get the same cards, it is very hard to pull ahead that much, as you can quickly get your own back.

Thematically, this game is a 10. It really evokes a sense of frustration and chaos that I assume folks felt in Poland in the 80s'. To the point where I think the is probably the most thematic game to simulate real life. So kudos to the designers for developing a game to educate the masses. Now for the game itself, the frustration in real life doesn't always translate well for games people play for leisure. The ability to change the queue of meeples or to shut down a store are all chaotic and random. Luckily only three cards are in play for each hand per person. Even then, it is enough to throw the game such that long term planning is kinda moot. Sure, you can load a queue with your meeples but if the store is shut down, you are out of luck. So I would say, play this game with an open mind and be prepared to get hosed. Then, all is well. There are a few good mechanics in the game. First, the black market I thought was under powered but intriguing. Especially with the moving 1:1 trade that you hope to catch during the round. The second part I like is the ability to pass and put cards back into the deck to be drawn again the next round. This allows you to plan a bit more with your moves.

Absolutely fun game. It was great to watch those speculator meeples creeping up from the back of the queue - and worrying that they might get that bar of soap before me. 

We've played this one more than any other game in the collection.

I really had fun playing this. Not something I would buy as it seems like it would get old real fast, though. The core concept of the game is waiting in line, and as a game all about this concept it works nicely to create a tense experience with some good old fashioned screw you as players jump each other in line, move the goods that players are waiting in line for, and occasionally even reverse the ordering of a line entirely. Needless to say this is a very tactical and ultimately shallow affair (for this heavy gamer's taste), but for what it is I really enjoyed it.

[International edition] The introduction in the rulebook is one of the most amusing ever. The game is not outstanding, but is very good at what it does. It is also real fun.

Great implementation of the theme, with the best production I've seen in a board game. It's not the bling that makes it so good, but the subtle details that bring the communist theme to life.

We are deprived Polish citizens mired in the bowels of communism. The game simulates family members standing in long lines for toilet paper and basic needs using hand management and set collection. Bizarre choice for a theme.  Maybe it provides a historical reference in the form of a game?

Huh! Probably the hottest Polish game after K2. After one 2-people game i can see lots of interaction (where you do not really want to help your opponent, basically the fight type without killing :p) plus careful planning. Deliveries come randomly, so you need to take this into account but tracking cards in your head will give you an advantage - something that people in the socialist Poland did not have.

I think it will work even better with more than 2 people but already is a cult game made in Poland :)

Ta gra to fantastyczne odkrycie! Prosta mechanika i oryginalny "setting" sprawiają, że nadaje się ona zarówno dla starych wyjadaczy planszówkowych, jak i dla ludzi grających tylko okazjonalnie. Warto dodać, że jest to JEDYNA gra, w którą gramy także z naszymi rodzicami, dla których powrót do PRL-owskiego sklepu jest jednocześnie czymś w rodzaju sentymentalnej podróży.

Pomimo prostych zasad i niezbyt heroicznej warstwy fabularnej (zakupy nawet za komuny nie były jednak walką z mrocznymi mocami albo zarządzaniem wielkim rodem szlacheckim), "Kolejka" jest emocjonującą grą o wysokim natężeniu konfliktu pomiędzy graczami. W odróżnieniu jednak od np. "Gry o Tron" jest on tu fantastycznie rozładowywany przez samą mechanikę gry. Nawet jeżeli ktoś nabruździ innemu graczowi zagrywając "Matkę z dzieckiem na ręku" lub "Pan tu nie stał", zwykle spotyka się to z wesołym odbiorem.

Za pomysł, mechanikę, łatwość zasad i łączenie pokoleń - dycha!

Aha - warto wspomnieć jeszcze o wykonaniu (bardzo dobre! w pudełku jest nawet wypraska) i cenie (jeśli tylko ktoś nie spekuluje ceną gry, można ją kupić za 55-60 złotych).

Zdecydowanie nie dla dwóch graczy, muszę spróbować w większym towarzystwie. Piękne wykonanie, bardzo klimatyczna. Lekka dawka negatywnej interakcji. Za 40 PLN nie ma co się zastanawiac, tylko trzeba brać! 
EDIT: Po kilku grach w więcej osób mam coraz gorsze zdanie o tej grze. Jest po prostu nudna :( I na dłuższą metę nie uratuje jej śmieszny PRLowski klimat :( Dlatego ją sprzedałem

After a play let me say it is a little bit confusing and seems that luck will be decisive ti win.
But maybe that with more practice you find a way to manage the queue

This is a good game on many levels. The queuing mechanism is something I've never come across somewhere else, and it works well. I like that the black market basically works as an additional player. The cultural and historical value of this game is through the roof. Filled with quirky details, charming pieces of history, despite depicting a difficult and rough time in Polish history. The quality of the board, booklet and other components are amazing. Just overall, a great and extraordinary gaming experience.

Now and then a round can get a bit stuck, especially by the end of the game, if the players are in need of items from the same shop. But that does not take anything away from the overall joy of playing it!

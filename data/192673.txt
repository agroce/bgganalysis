New rules much better. Solo play seems fine, but somewhat scripted (coop should be similar). Semi-coop with race not only for necessary to survive actions but also for most profitable(VP) ones could be more interesting.

my honest opinion, this is possibly the best single player scenario based game that had me on the edge the whole time.  it is deep and interesting.  The game really makes you think and is tough.  However, I never play single player because I like the experience of playing with others, and when you play this with more than one, it is boring.. loses all its luster.  great board, great components and outstanding game.. for 1 player..

Rushed out for Essen yet still took another 4 months to be sent to backers.  Rule book is terribly written and Red Imp refused to issue a reprint even though they had plenty of time after Essen.

Once you've read the rules, the FAQ and the various rules threads on here, it starts to make sense and the actual game is fun.  The icons on the board are intuitive so once you have the turn structure down, it flows quite well.  Only played solo so far and it is a good challenge.

RATING: 9
Very captivating game. I played it only solo yet, but I am sure I will do that many times to come. Can't wait to play it with more players.

Big part of my fascination comes with the theme. It really feels like taking care of a colony of humans, having to decide which task is the most important. You make a mistake, and people start dying! If you have read and enjoyed a good sci-fi book like "Red Mars" or "The Martian" (also a movie with Matt Damon), this is your game - in case you like coops.

There is only one problem already reported many times over and over: The rulebook is a mess! I had to watch two playthroughs and a set-up-video on youtube. Now, I am pretty confident on how to play it. I am sure the designer have NEVER tested the rulebook on someone who didn't know a thing about the game. Common mistake with KS games. But this one stands out in this regard - unfortunately negatively.

Very euro commodity exchange focused, with 'survival needs' kicker. The game works, but is overly punishing and there seems to be little one can do to interact with others, nor is there much you can do to catch up if you're falling behind. May have appeal with the hardcore euro set, but there just wasn't any feeling of accomplishment.

Woow this game has some negativa reviews that made me want to sell the game before i tried it. I am glad i didnt. I had to read the rules carefully and looked through the FAQ and errata to get the rules right... besieds that the game feels much like Robinson cruso that is my favorite coop boardgame. Even the competitive game feels much like you are fighting the harsh requirements on mars. The game is tense and exhiting.

Great concept, poor execution.
I really tried... really tried to like this game. I went through the game setup a number of times and attempted to play the solo game as well as a test run of 4 player co-op. I read the confusing rulebook and watched a number of YouTube videos and finally thought I understood the game mechanics. The last play through ended near the beginning of cycle 2 with no more energy and no possible way to continue.
I don't think Red Imp play tested this game long enough despite the confusing rulebook. Their game is broken and anybody that claims to have completed a full game must be using simplified house rules that the designer had no part of.
I bought this as a Kickstarter and I won't be backing any Red Imp games in the future.

kickstarted - and regret it. Rule book a total mess, and the game once you work it out not much better. Three versions, coop, semi coop and competitive. The competitive game just doesn't work, resource pool too small and people hoard, so going late in the turn order and you're screwed. Events massively swingy, can't see me ever playing that version again (unless the rules are wrong and it actually plays different). The coop, maybe as everyone is helping, but overall just not that much fun :(

[i]Disclaimer: This rating is for the competitive mode only[/i]
Martians: A Story of Civilization (from now on called Martians) is a rather straight forward worker placement game. For the duration of five cycles (which consist of 3 or 4 rounds), the players try to gather resources which they use to enhance their game engine, meet some demands in order to prevent the loss of workers in the next cycle and to trade them in for reputation (aka victory points). This process is "spiced up" by the introduction of random events and weather conditions in regular intervals which make your life harder (events) or alter the efficiency of some actions (weather). 

Comparing Martians to a song, I would say that it misses a hook which keeps you thinking about the game once it is finished. Everything that you see within Martians has been done in umpteen other worker placement games. Resource conversion, mild engine building and paying some upkeep every now and then. There's really nothing new here. You get a rather tight worker placement game that works and keeps you thinking but there isn't anything in the game that would lead me to say: "Hey, let's play Martians again."

Minden idők egyik legrettenetesebb szabálykönyve. A 14. oldalig gyakorlatilag nem derül ki semmi, csak minden kivételt és azok kivételét tisztázza, majd úgy gondolja, hogy ezután van értelme elkezdeni arról beszélni, hogy mégis mit kell csinálni.... Rettenet.

Node maga a játék meglepően jó. Nagyon jól sikerült ez az energia-munkás-idő hármast igénylő akciózás. Izgalmas és érdekes az "etetés" és a vele kapcsolatos büntetések, jó ötlet az épületek felépülésének menete. Pont megfelelő nehézségű, nem veszik el az ember az opciókban, de jól lehet tervezgetni, variálni.

Viszont... úgy érzem, hogy az eseménykártyák túlzott büntetéseket visznek a játékba. Emiatt egyértelműen úgy érzem, hogy inkább coopra lett kitalálva a játék, semmint kompetitívre, Coopban ugyebár ezek a büntetések jelentik a kihívást (többek között), de kompetitív módban ezek extrémek sújtanak egy-egy játékost, ráadásul készülni is képtelenség rájuk, mert 30 lapból alig pár kerül játékba.

Összességében nagyon kellemes darab, de kompetitívben "csak" kellemes, viszont coopban el tudom képzelni hogy a világ legjobbja is lehet. Mindenképpen ki kell úgy is próbálni.

I liked the game though the rulebook was bad. Probably the worst rulebook I have read since Rise of Empires. We tried the competetive game and had to resort to the rulebook a lot to clarify things. And often we had to read the same thing over and over again because it was so poorly explained.
Some of the random events also feel rather punishing for competitive play. Making the first action cost 2 actions or forcefully returning all your astronauts and you lose an action are something that can really screw your play while boosting others. I understand them in co-op mode but for competitive, they're a bit too extreme.

This is a GREAT game! Apparently, many gamers judge a game (and give a really really bad review) primarly for the rulebook... Ok, it is a mess. But everything is there, and with all videos, FAQ and discussion in the forums, I didn't have a hard time understanding Martians. The different scenarios make the gameplay immersive, the theme is really present and the mechanics become quite easy after a few turns. If you're not a worker-placement fan, this game is not for you. But if you like the martian theme, a great semi-coop, coop or solo experience with a good challenge and replayability, this game is a blast! 10/10 for the AMAZING board by the way. (note: I have the kickstarter components - didn't regret it!)

The game tries to accomplish too much.  I mean - 4 modes, phew...

Solo, semi-cooperative and cooperative modes are way too easy* (and scripted).

Competitive mode - it lacks tension, dramatic choices and truly competitive edge.
In result, the game, which tries to be everything, fails to meet expectations in any category.
Still, I might play the competitive mode (as the only one) without much fuss.  Just not with my copy any more...

Ah, the replayability is most likely a significant problem in any mode.

--
* Any scenario in solo mode is _ridiculously_ easy.  Maaybe it makes sense to play with commission cards (instead of a scenario) in order to maximize VPs, but it will not solve the problem of the scripted beginning and obviously optimal moves/no agonizing choices later on...
These issues are tackled flawlessly in e.g. Robinson Crusoe from Portal and RC is far superior as a solo (and a coop) game than Martians.
In Martians ASoC there is way too little of variety - different event/weather/excavation cards and scenarios(!) don't make ANY meaningful diffrence from the perspective of replayability.

---

The rulebook is DISASTROUS.  It took me a WEEK to figure out the rules combining the printed rulebook and the rules rewrite by Andy Lewis.
The worst published rulebook EVER.

There are serious issues with this game. Rules are incredibly unclear and degenerate strategies exist. All of that aside I think there is an even larger problem which is that the underlying game has no variety. Every game starts the same way with players needed to unlock the same buildings and set up energy production. Scenarios act as wrinkles that require you to sink time into something new each game.

This does not feel like a finished game to me.

Fun theme which definitely comes through in the gameplay.  Very interesting design that allows for fully competitive, semi-cooperative, of fully cooperative gameplay.  Balance may be an issue as it may be that a certain early move may provide distinct advantage (research extra time).  I need more gameplays though to truly test that theory.  This is a surprise winner for me and a definite recommendation.

the rules are ridiculously badly written, and the designers have been very slow about getting a proper errata written, and have rejected the notion of a revised edition. I spent an disproportionate amount of time understanding the rules. I had to play half a solo game to properly grasp some of the rules. I ended up quitting half way through as i found it utterly disengaging and pretty poorly designed.

I think in the end, struggling so much with the rules ruined the game for me. It might be interesting but i just can't bring my self to spend more time on it.

The rules are written in a terrible way. It is not known when and what is going on. They are round, turn, time unit and the colonists, and do not know what to do with all of this. While there will be better written rules of the game, I suggest you steer clear of a wide berth.

RATING: 6
Basically Caverna in space where you spend about two thirds of your actions paying for your workers. Make sure you play with the rules revision with fixed resource limits!

Unlike Caverna this game feels like it has to be done in a certain order, and there is one right way to play it, especially in co-op. Early on you HAVE to build both energy collectors and go for the breakthrough that gives an extra turn. Without both energy collectors the energy will run out at the end, ending the game early. As such I think the reliance on energy is negatively imbalanced.

Best as semi-coop and solo with modif: VP should give something

Competitive > must find a way to mitigate or delete the randomness

1)As mentioned in the new rulebook, nothing ever runs out of the game supply, hence replenish with other tokens. (we only ever needed to add 5 similar red regoliths and 15 similar yellow energy markers more to the game in our games with the variant).

2)The Builder expert needs $4 plus 1 each of the energy token, regolith token & supply token. No hour needed to be spent as suggested in the new rulebook (this sticks to the original theme where none of the other experts need any extra hour to perform the action).

3)Do not play with any blank regolith examinations cards. 
Remove all event cards that potentially affect only a few players instead of everyone equally. We have removed all Solar Flare event cards and Fire from event deck 2, Seeds from even deck 3 & Poising from event deck 4.

4)The weather report tech if developed on your player board lets you see the next weather card each time a new weather card is revealed.

5)Use any other token instead of the players disk to put in the players quarters(we use red,blue,green,yellow colored meeple from another game), this should increase the player disc supply by 1 to be used developing tech's. 
These disc's are not unlimited as suggested in the new rulebook.

6)Draw an event card right at the start of the game before the first round starts of the first cycle(more thematic for us and sticking to the graphics of the gameboard).
From the Supplement phase of the cycle 2 onwards refill each player's quarter's with only 1 food token instead of 2 and the rest remains the same i.e 1 medical demand token and 1 oxygen demand token gets added too.

7)In the Quarter Summary phase the existing tokens are not cleared from the quarter's. At any of the Quarter Summary phase if there is an oxygen demand token left then 1 colonist dies and that oxygen demand token is removed as per the original rules; if there are a total of 2 medical demand tokens left then 1 colonist dies of medical negligence and only then are the 2 medical demand tokens cleared in this phase; if there are a total of 3 hunger tokens left in this phase then 1 colonist dies of hunger and only then are the hunger tokens cleared from the players quarter's. (The idea of the colonist dying by 1 oxygen, 2 medical, 3 hunger tokens is taken from the graphics on the players quarters on the game board; there is roman numeral 1 printed next to oxygen, roman numeral 2 printed next to the medical & roman numeral 3 printed next to the hunger). You still have to put your action markers in the infirmary and/or the living quarters as in the normal rules for any token left in the quarter's.(this stops the gameplay abuse by the players in the competitive mode where it was easy to ignore the needs of your colony to fulfill the lucrative contracts and commission cards, also since the tokens are not automatically cleared the Physician expert card is not broken anymore in the competitive mode)

8)The new rulebook does not mention how ties are broken for the maximum build/upgrade tokens. We give 5 points to all tied players and 3 points to all ties for the second most of those tokens.

9)Each $4 equals to 1 victory point at game end.
All other game end victory points and penalties remain the same as mentioned in the new rulebook.

No rating yet - if so, it would be quite bad. But there's a lot of potential, with pimped up rules, will try them soon. I'd like to love this game, and probably will, with my "new rules". And I mean rules, not just rulebook, which is a good example of how not to write rules. Competitive version - no interest in co-op or solo.
Now, with my house-rules tested, I'd give an "8", otherwise a "6" or probably less - for competitive mode only. Cannot judge other modes. So I settled for "7", generally ...

Really a great game! After reading some reviews pointing negative aspects of the game, i thought i would have some issues playing it. Instead i really enjoy playing it and fing myself willing to play it again.
The game is an excelente worker placement, resource managment and survival where like in Robinson Crusoe there is a lot of reaplayability due to the diversity of missions in the game (KS edition). It is a heavy euro game and the rule book is really the negative point in the game but after seeing some rule explanation on youtube it is preaty easy to play and gives a lot of choice to think of how to elaborate the correct strategy.
I think those who like Robinson Crusoe will really like this one to.

- hra je totiž nedotiahnutosť vo všetkom, robí sa strašne komplexná, strašne vhodná na všemožné varianty hrania, ale keby aspoň jednu alebo dve herné varianty mala zvládnuté dobre - no proste nemá, tá hra je pekná iba vizuálne, ŽIAĽ

I love everything about Mars, so when I read about this game on Kickstarter I backed it immediately. Unfortunately, this was a bad mistake. The manual of this game is horrible and it took me quite a while to figure out how it is actually played. The game play is rather boring. You collect resources to transform them into food, water or medicine. That's it bascially. Sure, there are some events which make your life more difficult, but it still doesn't improve the overall game play. I really wanted to like this game and tried hard, but in the end of the day I traded it away. It's a real shame, because I'm sure it could have been a great game with a bit more work and playtesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
An unforgiving game with no catchup mechanism and no easy way for players to gang up on a leader as doing so can be so expensive for their own plans.  Some unintuitive design choices - the 3 workers align with the number time points a the start of the game, but when extra time points are obtained then there is more time than workers.  Rule book is apparently bad, and the description of rounds vs turn and game sequences overall is confusing and inconsistent.  Overall pretty fiddly. 

A tough game that could swing wildly due to card draw on the event cards.  Went in my favour the game I played, but I think it would be pretty frustrating as there is a fair amount of thinking going on and even great play could be hobbled by poor card draw.  Fair enough for light games, but not so much for a competitive game of this weight (wouldn't be so bad in co-op as it would be shared misery).

Seems to be interesting. Some nice aspects as the combination of worker, which you need to place at a location to activate it, and time units that you further need to do any actions at the activated location. So you might use just one worker in a one circle to do up to three actions at one location. Unfortunately we needed to quit the test game after two rounds, so we just get a first impression of the game. But this impression wake my interest to play once more....

This is a wonderfully thematic and engaging game... once you get through the horrificly written rulebook. Seriously, this is probably the most poorly written and confusing rule books I have ever seen. Many may find that the effort to learn the game is simply not worth it. However, if that hurdle can be overcome, the game turns out to be very interesting and is a real challenge. So, had the rule book not been so awful, this would have easily been in the mid-7 range.

3 ways to play this game and my first game we played competitive. very punishing game if the events fall the wrong way at any moment. competitively is the only way I have played so far and it falls into the category I generally dislike where the game hates you more than the players hate you. I am however opened to playing it co-op I think it will work much better for me. I definitely have a mixed opinion about this game.

KS edition @ Essen. 
This is definitely one of the Top Ten Thematic/Euro games. Oozes theme with every component and every action and every scenario. But....
Rule book does a very poor job teaching how to play. Great board, good mechanisms supporting theme, excellent components. With 13 scenarios and 3 modes of play, Co-op is superb in teamwork requirements, competitive mode is very challenging! Solo is my favorite. There is plenty of fun for 1-4. FAQ & rewrite of rules -- or users have to do it. Too bad designers, you should have done it. (Would rate it a 10 with a good rule book.)

Thankfully I had someone teach me how to play Martians.

The rulebook is one of the worst I've ever seen. There are multiple modes of play, but the rules are explain in sequence, eschewing specific sections that explain the difference between the modes. You have to pick it apart and find the rules relevant to how you intend to play. Referencing anything is a nightmare.

The comments comparing "Martians: A Story of Civilization" to "Caverna" or "Agricola" are not entirely accurate; those are much better games - that the developers of Martians have clearly played. There's not anything new, or particularly interesting to do here that hasn't been better elsewhere.

*Note only played this game with the competitive rules.
 
This game is a very punishing worker placement game about surviving on Mars. Individually the punishing mechanics (weather, start of round events, etc) are not that bad, but when you group them all together, it seems like you cannot get anything done. While this might actually simulated what it would really be like to live on Mars, it took the fun out of the game. Also, no one wanted to pay the resources to open up more worker placements spots, as it seemed like it would benefit the other players more. I haven't played the coop version, but I think that might take an edge off the harshness of the game and make it more enjoyable.  

Someone else taught the game, but my understanding from them was the rule book needs a lot of work.

The rules are a horrible mess for this game. My initial play took way too long. Some parts of the game are not intuitive and I consider the inability to get energy except through production to be a flaw. Losing a colonist also begins a death spiral for that player. I considered Kickstarting this game, but chose to get Terraforming Mars instead and am glad I did.

KS version.
All-in-all it is actually a good game. it just really-really needs revision of rules.

It has the worst rules I've ever read. Too much text and very hard to crasp the cycle, round and turn process with he main rulebook, including the set-up. A players set-up sheet available on the BGG is a MUST HAVE in order to set this game up and play it properly. Really. I spent hours without it.

Very confusing iconography too, not consistently showing all the information you need to know. E.g. one expert card shows that you need only credits to do the building, expect in the rules (if you find it there!) you get to know that it only replaces time unit, nothing else. So, as they choose to show less with iconography, they actually make you know&look 10x more into rules as you need to know there is actually "exception" in using this card.

This game has so much potential that is being wasted. It needs a properly streamlined rulebook (maybe some game modes aren't as playable either - exclude those and use the one that works the best or atleast state other gamemodes as alternative rules, not as equal).

Still the game is very thematic and had it's high points. I will regard this as a strictly co-op game at least as it was now because it is the only way it could result in a satisfying experience and in a replay for me.

RATING: 3
beautifull game but oh boy the game design has big flaws all over the place

[+] artwork is great, theme is great and present
[-] events/wether are so random and punishing with no way to mitigate them so no way to prepare and execute a long term strategy; overall the game is too short (in terms of actions) to really develop something; advisers/experts cards lack variety and are barely worth the investment; the contracts in competitive game are so random and unthematic; drawing minerals is so random and frustrating due to void cards; unlocking the 4th action is almost imossible and even if you do, you might get to use it twice at most, wtf? there's a lot of available action spots but so few time units too spend, it's never satisfying to "achieve" something; actions that award VP and the amount of VP for it feels pretty random as well; the whole design feels "not finished"; often have the feeling that the game is playing itself and you as a player just try to do stuff here and there

COOP: [-] OMG everything is shared between players, might has well play alone; this feels like it was designed as a PURE solo game; I've never seen a game with such a risk of alpha-player; the game is challenging tactically because you have next to no information about future events and very few actions to react to them, but it's not hard to achieve a success so no real draw to come back to it; only 4 scenarios...

SEMI-COOP: [-] now each player is doing his part, all players must achieve scenario success together but try to score as much as possible to win... sounds cool but not such a great experience, VP being awarded for some actions not others in various values; very unsatisfying 

COMP: [-] too much randomness everywhere to be able to develop and execute any strategy; too few mineral cards to create a race for contracts (let's say there's a contract that requires 2 green minerals; there are only 2 maybe 3 green mineral cards in the deck, so if I have 1 and another player has 1, noone will ever complete the contract)

I regret backing this game on Kickstarter. My wife and I did not care for this game. The rules are a mess, but we did figure out how the game works. For us, the game simply wasn't fun. I like challenging co-ops, but this game is very punishing. If you make one incorrect move, you're screwed. I'm sure we could figure it out eventually, but there are so many other better games out there to play.

I buyed the kickstarter version with all the stretch goals at Essen 2016. Everything painted. Very good and heavy euro game that uses same mechanics as "The Manhattan Project" to retrieve your workers but it takes not a whole action, just 1 time. (You have 3 times to use in your action). Rulebook is very hard to read, but once you have played a cycle, it falls in place.

Economic and colonization worker placement on the surface of Mars where you must keep the colony profitable and healthy. A fairly typical albeit moderately heavy euro with the usual move space guys to places to spend stuff to get different stuff to do things better--but the theme speaks to me--and I look forward to giving it a try. I'm fascinated both by the unknown of outer space and the science and understanding of contained living systems.  I love the action choices to develop wind and solar power, improve training for more skilled workforce, move and deploy the drill to extract ice crystals, soil, and core sample minerals, manage co2 levels, grow food in bio domes, develope medicine (as the biosphere taught us,, contained systems cannot handle bad germs!), develop communal and/or private science lab research, improve reproduction and genetics for younger more efficient generations.  Of course Murhpy's Law applies to colonies on Mars, unpredictable weather and disruptive breakdowns, not to mention a tempermental oxygen plant--oh yah, that. The game board vividly conveys the challenge of colonizing Mars. I like that this game emphasizes effort in units of time. Designed with four similar but different enough play modes for competitive, semi-coop, coop, and the solitaire challenge that also interests me.

People are giving it ones without playing it.  I'll change my rating once I've played it.

Enjoyable experience solo ,Very thematic. Brain burner of a game. Needs more scenario cards, Once  a scenario  is completely finished you feel like you really accomplished something,  I do not not see myself playing each scenario again. Would be amazing with a campaign style story pack. Different weather cards and more events would be nice.

2-4 players place their works to explore the planet in search of necessary resources, build new constructions, and develop technologies adjusted to planetary conditions.

A fun but difficult game of Martian colonization.  The difficulty is compounded by a truly terrible rulebook.  After the developers posted an amended rulebook (months after release), it is finally playable.  It was surprisingly engaging.  We lost horribly.  We will play again.

Martians is a game about converting A and B into C, then converting C and A into D, then using D to get rid of E. See my review [thread=1691032]here[/thread].

I dislike the (competitive) game because : 
* The rules are not clear by just reading the book
* The choices are uninteresting or too uncertain to go that way (mining deck with lots of blanco), the production chain is very obvious: do A to get B to get C. 
* The swing due to weather cards and mining cards (with blanco cards in it) is too big in competitive modus
* One player can block the action space to upgrade your tableau for several rounds, this is really frustrating since the tableau is individual (most other action spaces have a spot for all players)
* The latter is even more frustrating if you made the mistake to unlock that space but you're now out of time and another player takes the spot (granted this was a beginner mistake but it was annoying as hell)
* One event card literally eliminated a player from the game  although he had a logical strategy (theme annihilated gameplay here) 
* Energy resource is needed for almost all action spaces, but your energy producers are influenced by random weather cards, so difficult to strategize for that. If you don't build these early, you are screwed and out of the game without a way to come back (yes there's a little bit of backup energy available, but this gets depleted early)

Overall: The game wants to simulate realism but forgets that good gameplay is more critical

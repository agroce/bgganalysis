I guess having played 1857 first this doesn't seem so brutal to me. I do enjoy the mix of operations plus stock shenanigans, plus the quick play time. It's got everything in just the right combinations.

Only played this one once and I'm sure there was plenty of poor play and some things that escaped us in terms of how to play well on this map. In general it seemed like a nice addition to the series. There are a few special rules, but overall my impression is that it's not that different from 1830 (the minors were the major difference, though they had only a small impact in our game; we also didn't have any merger with the NdM, which only floated right at the end).

Edit: Played second time. Felt like we played much better, lots of cutthroat plays, companies getting dumped and forcing train purchases, stock trashing and other assorted nasty moves. The diesels came out, but there was again no nationalization (by choice, as the NdM floated much earlier). I quite liked it, but personally I find the 1830 diesel trains more interesting (bigger price difference, require more careful planning and are much more sensitive to the overall quality of your route), I think I still prefer 1830, but 18Mex is certainly a good game; it's also a faster game than 1830, which is just a bit too long to be played in an evening session.

Edit2: Another game, I think we're starting to get the hang of it now. Fastest train rush I've ever seen, there was no merger because we went from a stock round when you couldn't buy NdM shares to one when the merger opportunity had already passed. I quite enjoy this variant, even though I still think the diesels are too easy on you (only need to have 4 stations in your line). Played once again, with 3 nice but not great.

The NdM merger is an interesting concept.  Relative to other 18xx titles there is a train rush to manage, but it would be a class 2-2.5 (white water rapids analogy).  I sitll got bowled over by it.

Two playings.  A nice 1830-"clone" - most of the mechanics match those found in 1830 (unlike some other 18xx, eg 18EU, 1826, etc) with some chrome added (Phase 3 1/2 and 6 1/2  - really just transition points - being among the most amusing additions).  I like the pacing, with the early train advancement slowed leaving room for development and faster train advancement late when most track is more-or-less in place.  There may be too great a gap between the "good" companies and "bad" companies, but I look forward to more playings to find the nuances.

We played it with 4. I really liked it.

It's not very hard. The game was tense and the final scoring pretty tight.

Need to play it again. Now we know what we've done wrong (like not floating NdM) ;)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Interesting map, interesting company position, interesting train rush. Recommended.

After 3rd match: stock market appreciation a little bit too low for my tastes, final-route building a bit unimportant due to the 4Ds, and merger rules can only be accurately planned within a strategy if you're playing in a fine-tuned 18xx group.

RATING: 9.5
Smaller, but the National adds a bit to think about. This, and the train rush acceleration at the same time, put a lot of interesting balls in the air. With the slow early trains, the early game is expanded - good thing. The late rush and the 4Ds speed up the late game (where xx can drag). The pacing is just right.

RATING: 9
One of the best 18xx - certainly one of the shortest, and it has lots of nice little improvements over the other 18xx games (IMHO), only problems are:  it's still fairly long by today's euro-game standards, there appear to be first tier and 2nd tier companies, meaning there are some that just won't get floated early and will never have a good route (those in the south, particularly UdY) - but that's true of other 18xx games too.

RATING: 7.5
1830 private auction
Lots of terrain, most expensive
3 minor companies
2 yellows per OR or one upgrade
One train per OR per company until phase 4, then as fast as you want
Penultimate and last 3 trains are semi-poison
Slower the game, the better the minors are
Three clear tiers of companies, Good/Great, Good and Fragile
Interesting tokening and track, but not fascinating
Operating order can be huge in the early game
NdM (National) merger in Phase 5 -- usually a relief
NdM is usually HUGE
Fairly flat stock market - stock is ~60% of net worth or less
Biggest train is a 4D (after standard 6s)
Fairly fast train rusn: usually from last 3->4D in 1-2 ORs
Last 3 will usually never run, 4s will run once due to soft obsolescence
Roughly 50/50 game endings on bank exhaustion or stock-price maxed
Best with 4 players, 3 is Okay, 5 is a one too many
~3.5 hours,

18MEX left a strong impression.  Though it's built largely around the 1830 ruleset, there's enough subtle weirdness here to separate it.  The stockmarket is one of those weird things, particularly its flatness which will make this a game far more interested in dividends than share value.  I'm also rather intrigued by the possibility of running a company to the "200 spot" for an early game over.

The cheap 4Ds were another weird twist which made the end-game feel fresh and exciting.  I'd be eager to try this with more than three players and see how mean the train rush becomes.

RATING: 7
18Mex is a good medium length 18XX game from the 1830 mould, albeit, with a more gentle train cost progression.

Nothing really fancy here: 50% full capitalization, 3 minors that exchange for shares in the big National company, and said national company can swallow one of the other majors midway through the game.

The terrain is fairly pricey because of the expansive cactus forests, but companies get "mail route" income at the start of each OR where they own a train equal to their base city's value, so little increments of 20+ are coming in, and 20 is the most common terrain cost, so it ends up being a wash a lot of the time. Honestly, I'd probably ditch the mail rules and ditch the cactus cost for the sake of cleanliness if I was developing this, but again, I'm one for pared down rules versus historical accuracy in games that are longer and more complex.

18Mex is good for a change of pace, though not different enough to justify ownership of for more casual 18XX players...if such a thing even exists. I'd have no objections to playing it again, but it's not really an improvement over a standard like 1830 either, and the slightly gentler train costs softens the train rush consequences a bit, which means I would actually prefer 1830 in a head to head. I'm also a tad put off by the 4D trains for the same reason that I dislike them in 18AL: namely, they make planning routes too easy for the end game and devalue cagey use of station tokens. The train rush can be pretty fast here once the buy limits are removed midway into the game, but as I mentioned earlier, the train cost progression is slow so players seem to be able to raise the money needed when things get rusted out from underneath them.

18Mex is in the same family of games as 1830, and shares a lot of structural characteristics with its ancestor. What differentiates it are interesting little twists like more interesting private companies, the presence of a national railroad that shapes strategies without overwhelming them like the CGR does in 1856, and the presence of lots of expensive terrain. This combines into a game that is a nice trip off the beaten path of 1830, one that I expect to be visiting for quite a while, particularly since I sold my copy of 1830. I think it is ultimately my third favorite 18XX game behind 1848 and 1860.

A medium-length 18xx with lots of minor twists and turns, and yet it manages to stay nicely playable. The train rush starts out slow, then picks up a lot of speed when the 4s come out. Terrain is often expensive, and turn order can be quite important especially in the early game, even though tiles aren't a very scarce resource here.

This is an 18xx game with privates, minors, publics, and nationalization.  It has extensive finance and stock manipulation opportunities.  You buy all track, 2 yellow tile lays for public companies, and tons of special city upgrades.  For me this game comes off flat because it does lots of stuff o.k. and nothing fantastic.  I will play it, but I doubt Iwill ever order it.

This is comfortably Mark Derrick's best game to date, more nuanced than his previous designs with a clever start packet and varied companies. Its origins in the likes of 18AL are evident in the limitation of 1 train purchase/OR which is suddenly removed at mid game leading to a very brief, but very bloody train rush. Expensive 4-Trains may well run just once. The skids really are under you at this point and timing this well is effectively the game decider. This aspect is perhaps a little too manic, I'm all for train rushes, but time to pause and consider while it's happening would be my preference. Playing this is like ski-ing down a mountain of banana skins, I prefer more control.

There's nothing about an 18xx game that provides me any form of enjoyment, and so the prospect of spending another three hours(at minimum) per session at least half a dozen more times just to progress past the conscious incompetence stage is unappealing. The strategies and tactics of this genre will forever remain opaque to me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
18MEX's strength is its medium length and complexity approach coupled with a tough train rush. Route construction is interesting with a lot of expensive terrain but no scarcity of tiles. I can understand the majority opinion that this is one of the most playable 18xx once the basics are mastered.
After first play I can see that we've probably haven't played the train rush as cutthroat as it will be in experienced groups, the National rail merger didn't happen. It's open enough in its decision space that I made a lot of mistakes (compared to smaller and more 'obvious' 18xx's like 18Scan or 1889).

Only one play, and first notable step outside of the 1830 rules.  Would like to play it more before asserting a real opinion.  I won on my first try, against some folks that I had no business beating.  I'd like to imagine that this will not repeat itself.  That said, it was interesting trying to manage the National railroad with its limitations regarding the buying and selling of trains.

Boredom, deep boredom. I really don't think this is as complicated as some will make you believe. The stock and the company parts should not feel alien to an newspaper-reading adult. The game, however, falls easily into the realm of pure boredom. I played it with more experienced players and, as a disclaimer, I have to blame them for a great part of my miserable experience - while one played an iPad during the whole game, others would urge the newbies to play faster, even if blindly, just so they could take very long turns themselves. Even so, 18MEX allows other players to drag the game for too long, locking the flow of the game for hours, literally. I surely prefer to be kicked in the nuts than to play this game again.

What an awesome 18XX.  This is my favorite of Mark Derrick's games, and maybe my favorite 18XX period, given that I am biased toward the shorter titles. It is so good it knocked 18GA and 18AL both down a full point (to 8 and 7).  

In 18Mex the trains start moving slowly, which allows players to set up the board. But the 4s come out the train rush accelerates dramatically. Fortunately the corporations' mail runs seem to put just enough money into the game to make it all possible.

I like the way the NdM merger creates opportunity, but does not dominate the game. I love the odd corners created by the port tiles and the Copper Canyon.  All in all this is an outstanding game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Starts off slow with only being able to purchase 1 train a turn. Then once the 4 gets bought, all hell breaks loose. It's fast, it's dramatic and the map is small and tokening areas becomes vital quickly. Still unsure of how I feel about the merger since we haven't had a lot of useless companies to merge into it. It feels slightly tacked on, but it can help save a dying company. Maybe we just need to play more cutthroat?

You definitely have some mid game companies in this one and with 5, you can be shut out of owning 2 easily. I think I prefer this game with 4, but all player counts are brilliant. This game is easily played within 2 1/2 hours and we can easily get 2 game of this in a night. My only complaint is that some of the rules are a bit vague and the privates aren't exactly that interesting. I wish they had a mountain bonus one or something.

Still, this is hands down my favorite 18xx so far and my #1 rated game. It may change over time, but I still see something drastically different every time I play.

3.5 hour 18xx game with a nice mounted board. Adds a couple of minors and a big public railroad to the basic 1830 formula.The train rush is described as 'sick' and 'unbearable' and 'broken', so I must own this.

Similar length to 1846 so this is easy to play when less time is available.  The 4D trains (run to 4 cities and double them) are easy to run at the end of the game so the last few rounds go quickly.  I do like 1846 better as there seem to be more options in the game, but 18MEX is fine on occasion just for a bit of variety.

The impending Train Rush Of Doom creates a different early-game environment than I was expecting, probably because my opponents were anticipating it and playing accordingly. I suspect if you get caught unawares to the timing of it, you'll get slaughtered. Didn't happen to any of us, though.

RATING: 8
What a game! It's interesting in many of the ways that 1830 and 1889 are, but with enough new chrome and corporations to keep me scratching my head. There is a greater focus on dividends over stock price, which through me for a loop and kept me from winning my first game. That's a good sign because I want games that challenge my established strategies in interesting ways. That's not to say I like it better, but really that I like it different.

Fundamentally, I don't think the 1830 branch of 18xx (loot your first company to set up your second one) lends itself well to smaller games. Players are virtually forced into a certain pattern of development and the lack of company variety means that play becomes extremely stereotyped.

Despite this, 18Mex is probably the best of the "small" 1830 variants, with a smaller, but not too small, map. Best with exactly 3.

My favorite 18xx so far. Upgraded to a 9 after second play. Awesome map.

RATING: 8
An okay 18xx that has the downside of being a bit user hostile compared to more recent printed 18xx. Colored discs to help separate company tokens from the other side of the table and a bit more "player aid" on the company charters and this would rate higher. As is I was constantly confusing two companies which had nearly identical stickers until you looked really close. I much prefer the new wave of 18xx which have taken after the help symbols and player-oriented design from euro games. 
Apart from that the game is pleasant. Especially like the minor railways and brutal train rush. Didn't like the train run rules of running to town after last station, unnecessary complication that made it much harder to find the optimum route.

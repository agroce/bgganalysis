RATING: 5
Oh my head hurts. The rules are very simple, but for a game that is all about thinking a few steps forward, Kamisado is an extremely  frustrating experience. This is because the board is extremely busy. When you are trying to follow the possible movement paths with your eyes, your need to move your sight all over the board jumping from one space to another at the opposite side. Thus you will very soon forget where you were coming from and you have start over. I am sure that experience will help but I reckon most people will just give up because they will lose track of what is going on.

The game is ok but it is a bit of a chore to play.

A great abstract game.  Very accessible.  I probably won't pick it up, as 1) it's too chess-like for me, and 2) the box is huge for a 2-player game.  (In its defense, the box is huge due to the high-quality components.)

I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Kamisado is a very quick and simple abstract game. The board is colorful, the mechanism is simple, but it does offer some tactics to wrap your head around.

However, I didn't enjoy it. First of all, the component quality could have really been better. The plastic pieces are nice, but the cardboard is pretty cheap and the artwork a kinda sloppy. Yet, also the game-play didn't really resonate with me. I'm not a fan of abstract games in general, but this one didn't seem like anything special to me.

Mediocre and forgettable. I'm not interested in trying it again either. A pass for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Chess like game with a completely different way of thinking. The color on which your piece lands activates a specific piece of the opponent. So you have to force the opponent in the direction you want the game to go.

Very strategic, but takes quite some time to get used to this way of thinking.

We have only just gotten into playing pure abstract games but this is sure to be a favorite. Looking like a cross between chess and checkers it is neither (fortunately). Each player moves a piece as far forward as he likes either orthagonally or diagonally. Whatever color he lands on decides what piece the other player may move. But all you or your opponent has to do to win is get one piece to the opposite side. So each movement is critical. And in the end, guess what? You are the one who gives your opponent the move to beat you. "YOU beat you!" as the Dice Tower's Zee Garcia put it.

Kamisado is the best invention on planet Earth since Chess.

While Chess strategy is very obviously complex, Kamisado strategy is deceivingly elaborate, lightning fast, and on a razor's edge at each and every move. As a bonus and despite its complexity, a straight game of Kamisado is quick. Kamisado is an attractive and intellectually demanding game for those of us who are short of time and like a challenge.

RATING: 7.5
While not for the color timid, this vibrant game uses a remarkably simple concept to drive the game play.  The color that you land your piece on, is the color of the piece that your opponent must move.  That simple trick results in a surprisingly good abstract game.  Is it as deep as Chess?  One round isn't, but add in the shifting movement rules and pushes that promoted pieces have and play several rounds and you've got yourself a very nice game.  The display of the game is likely to be a distraction and I'm not sure if a symbol only version would or could work as easily, but it regardless - it sure is a nice little game that was a surprise hit for me.

A Chess-like abstract game in which your only aim is to get a piece into the a starting place of your opponent. The color of the square in which you land your piece determines the color of the piece your oponnent will move next, and so on.

Régen játszottam ilyen mély, és jól felépített logikai játékkal. Talán a sakkhoz vagy go-hoz lehetne hasonlítani komolyságban. A sakkot leszámítva most nekem ez a top1 logikai:) Rövid partikat játszottunk így elsőre, de időben ennél többet igényelne. Jópár lépéssel előre kell látni, mi történik, mert könnyen kényszerlépések következhetnek, vagy olyan helyzet állhat elő, hogy nem tudunk lépni, és ellenfelünk fonalasan nyer 2-3 lépésben. Nagyon jó!!!

Cleverly designed abstract game. While the colorful design really hurts my eyes it does serve a purpose. The premise of the game is simple. Get to the other side with any of your pieces. When you move a piece you can move it as far forward as you like. Either straight forward or diagonally. Your oponent then moves his piece of the color you landed on. The alternate setup in consecutive rounds ensures a new challenge every time. This really is a good game, it's just not my cup of tea.

Despite being a color-based, Chess-alike abstract game with a fainty Japanese theme pasted on, Kamisado turns out as a good and fast two-player filler: the only issue it has is, it’s unbalanced in favour of the player who moves first, especially if he chooses to play aggressively. [i](April 2012)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - Although I haven’t changed my mind about Kamisado (it’s still a fine two-player game), one of the goals I set for my Fall 2015 rating revise was to keep half-point ratings to a minimum: thus, since it isn’t one of those, I rounded down my rating from 6,5 to 6.

This is a another very good abstract game for two players with very good ideas... I'm discovering a bunch of great pure abstract games in 2009.

Teresa loves this game and always beats me. So it's a keeper for play with my wife.

I had reservations with Kamisado's over production because I thought a good abstract strategy game doesn't need to look good but once you put the board on the table is amazing and has good apeal. The only issue is the horrible and unfunctional transparent stones to mark sumo towers of Huch and Friends Edition wich I have, someday I have to find a solution with washers of diferent sizes to mark sumo towers like original Edition.

Too much of an abstract-y chess-like game for me.  Not a bad game, just not the type that I like to play often.

Note to self:  Don't move all the way to the other side of the board unless you are forcing an opening in the opponents back row where the guy you moved could move to... otherwise the opponent can make your "far up" guy try to move... he's blocked... and your opponent gets a free move.

CAVEAT: I get a kick out of this game, because it's the sort of abstract I like: quirky, not too hard but with layers of depth, short, and pleasingly presented (although Kamisado is more quirky than great in that respect than Khet or ZERTZ or TAMSK or other GIPF games). But the game hasn't gone over that well with the people I've played it with, who (I think) have just found it more odd than appealing. So YMMV.
---
First impressions are quite favorable. It's a sharp, fast, tactical game. Like the GIPF games, it seems to be about retaining mobility, but unlike the GIPF games, you want to keep your options open until you can make a lightning strike for the win. Nicely scaled with short, medium, long, and ultra-long games, and the Sumo towers are a clever scoring/linking technique.

I've only played a couple times, but quite promising.
---
I'm not generally an abstract fan, but a few suck me in just because they just look cool ... Khet was one, this is another. Looking forward to giving it a try. Something my chess-playing family members may get a kick out of. Or, it may cause their heads to explode. Who knows.

Fun game, would recommend this. Love the large chunky compoments of the original version; I understand there is a smaller, less colourful version being produced nowadays. Game play is simple. Not sure if there is strategy since I'm not good at planning ahead. It is best to play as a match of several games (needn't be at a sitting but must record positions since final position determines next game's starting position) to take advantage of the sumo rules.

Kamisado is great. It clearly looks like Chess and feels somewhat similar to checkers. Depending on the color of the field you land on, your opponent must play his pawn of the according color. The goal is to get an own pawn on the opposing base line. Great game but a tad simpler than chess and doesn't take remotely as long.

Beautiful (I think so, at least) 2-player abstract with incredibly simple rules yet great underlying strategy.  The basic game plays quickly, but there are options for more advanced (and interesting) play.
Have now played a standard game (only up to 3 points so far), and am really enjoying the more interesting play over the basic game.  My 5 and 9 year olds are playing along with me and have really picked up the rules and strategy quickly.  Tonight my 5 y.o. made a great move that forced my piece into a choice of only 2 colors - either one giving her the win on the next move.  I was so proud of her!  :)

RATING: 5
The few short games I played under the tutelage of one of the sons of the designer while at Spiel 2008 were interesting—especially since the little guy took absolutely no mercy on my linguistical skills and prattled on as if I were a native—but not yet sufficient to entice me to purchase a copy of the game. I like the game's shortness and clear GIPF-yness meaning that finding opponents isn't going to be that hard. But what I don't like is the rather colourful design which for some reason I don't agree with. The game gets one point deduction for that. My girlfriend on the other hand indicated that she has no objection whatsoever at this game turning up in our collection one time or another, so I expect it probably will.

[b]Update[/b]  I had the opportunity to play this game anew with the second edition, which does away with the rings to indicate the sumos and instead used cheap and nearly invisible plastic bits. Ergonomically this is a disaster, but I will admit that the removal of the gold and black turds on top of the towers and making the towers white or black helps considerably. The board is easier for me to read now. But still, after a number of games, I still found I have trouble doing so with all the different colours. In addition, I got the ever stronger feeling that Kamisado is not really about outwitting your opponent on your own terms because your strategy is better, but by being able to play a game of ‘future Simon' better. Games always seemed to reach a semi-stalemate where but one false move would give away victory; I'm not sure I like this very much. I've removed the game from my wishlist as a consequence. (That it eventually wormed its way into my collection is the fault of my partner.)

[b]Update 2[/b] The game came and went.

RATING: 9.75
An abstract for puzzle-lovers.  Anyone who enjoys Chess "mate-in-x" puzzles should enjoy this.  

I've seen people criticize it as being merely "brute force look-ahead" and - while there is blocking and positional play, especially early in a round where the game tree is too thick and thorny to hack through - yes, it does essentially boil down to that.  Similarly to something like Ricochet Robots, it's very possible for one player to simply be better at this type of thinking, but such is the nature of skill.  Handicaps could be given in the form of harsher time-controls for the stronger player.

Also, I feel it bears mentioning that a player with enough time to thoroughly analyze the game tree could hypothetically simply play using a chart.  I'm fairly certain the basic game is solvable for one player or the other.  Undoubtedly, someone will eventually do so, and it will kill the game in the eyes of many.  Which is a shame, because if you simply randomize the set-up for the basic game, it becomes bulletproof.

Bizarre and unique racing/transversal game. The unique mechanism limits the branching factor so much that it seems solvable, and the foresight and calculation required on each move makes it difficult for human players. An excellent challenge! Games are super quick, but there is quite a bit of depth in 20 or so moves. It's probable that first player has some advantage, though I don't think it's been conclusively shown. Both the bot on boardspace.net and my iphone app seem nigh unbeatable, but I'm not very good.

A very clever, nicely looking abstract. The strategy is probably pretty counter intuitive for someone who has played chess a lot, but this makes it all the more intriguing.

Only played once so far so the rating may slide a bit one way or another. I liked it - a solid family abstract capable of stepping up to a full brain-burner if you so wish.

Has certain similarities with a 1970's game called [GAMEID=12319] produced by Spears.

Loses half a point for over-production and a poor insert. The whole game really could have been smaller and the colour aesthetics just a little bit more subdued. Also despite the size of the box the sumo-rings don't fit nicely in and have to be carefully arranged in a thin layer on top of the board otherwise the lid will not close.

Kamisado is a great abstract with simple rules and a decent amount of strategy.  Although it's hard to be certain after a handful of plays, beginners and advanced players alike shouldn't have too much difficulty competing with each other.  Since what you do on your turn is determined by what your opponent does on their turn, you can only plan so much in advance and it becomes less a game about manipulating the board so much as manipulating your position to pounce on a win.

In a sense, I got the feeling of constant check in chess where you are attempting to force your opponent to do the move you want them to do (only you're not really forcing them, so it's not entirely like a check state).

At any rate, it's a game made extra lovely by its wonderful tower components that could easily be replaced by gemstones or something simple; the tactile joy of the game is definitely enhanced by the wonderful pieces.

This is a game worth exploring and perhaps studying, but I doubt I'll ever find enough takers to learn anything significant.

Kamisado is a cool concept for an abstract game, it feels that the leap between casual play (or learning a few basic strategies) and a more mathematical understanding is quite large, which means I'll probably never figure it out myself and just use cheap tactics to try to force wins.  So, limited fun for me, but still good fun nonetheless.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Kamisado is incredibly hard to grasp. Its basically playing chess with eight queens, with the additional twist that your opponent picks which piece you can move. While this is an intriguing premise, in practice the game offers too little control. Strategies hinge on one's ability to pin their opponent, thereby immobilizing one of the pieces and exploiting that color to repeatedly move one's own piece. Planning ahead is crucial but incredibly abstruse, thus granting experienced players an insurmountable advantage over new players.

If you're looking for a fun abstract that's family friendly, quick to play, easy to learn, and has high quality, gorgeous, colourful components, then Kamisado might just be what you're looking for!
Here are some of the great things it offers:
* Simple rule-set that's easy to teach and to learn
* Quick gameplay, with most games only taking 10-15 minutes at most
* Scope for advanced concepts (Sumos) for those wanting additional challenges in a series of rounds
* Attractive and colourful overproduced components
* Strongly tactical, offering a level playing field where new players can do well

Yet another unique abstract. In this one, the location of where you move determines what piece you can move. So, for example, if you move your purple piece to a brown spot, then your opponent must move their brown piece. Everything moves like a queen in chess, except it can only move forward (straight or diagonally), and you cannot capture or jump. Your goal is to get any piece to to the other side.

Games can be extended into longer matches, where winning pieces can be upgraded into "sumos" which can push other pieces.

That's pretty much it.

Games tend to be short and aggressive, but it can be hard to look ahead.

A decent diversion for a while, but gets a little boring. Available on iPhone.

I hate abstracts.  This one finally grabbed me.  I love this game.  It is fast.... every move affects your opponent.  Trying to see the moves ahead are a wonderful brain twist.  I really like this game.  (And it was a gift!  Nobody gets me games, knowing I have over 500!)

Kamisado is an abstract game with quite simple and intuitive rules, yet it plays somewhat unintuitively at first. The way you determine your opponent's moves with where you move your own pieces takes a few turns to sink in. After that it's smooth sailing, however.

Kamisado is maybe best described as a game of not making mistakes because usually the first mistake will make you lose. If nobody makes any mistakes, the game thankfully avoids the trap of bogging down in some kind of stalemate by forcing a decision sooner or later, but that may still turn out to be a weakness because whether that's a more satisfying result is obviously a different question.

2008 acquisition.

Provional rating after a few basic games only.  Despite the limited plays (and only the basic rules), this is a very good abstract game.  It has very simple set of rules but each move requires a lot of forward thinking.  This is a game of manoeuvring your pieces so as to limit the options your opponent has.

Unfortunately, I'm not a fan of the aesthetics of the game.  Some of the colours are too similar, the dragons perched on top of the dragon towers are very hard to make out and look like something distinctly unpleasant (if you know what I mean), the sumo rings are functional and some of them seem twisted and look definitively cheap.  All these to me are just a bit of gimmick and may turn some people off this fine game.  Personally, I think having simpler pieces like the ones you see in the GIPF series may give the game a more ellegant feel.

Will hit the table soon.

RATING: 6.9
Definitively not a game for the color blind.
The only color information in the Huch edition are the japanese signs printet on top of the tower. Sometimes it's hard to tell dark-purple from brown or light red from pink. Beside that it's an pleasing, fast, no luck 2 player game with quick to grasp rules. The advanced/Sumo rules do not add that much. Nice filler as one game can be played in 10mins. It's abstract and clean design could make this once a modern classic.

Ugly board, cool idea almost in a zertz kind of way, here though, the spot YOU land on dictates which piece your opponent can move.  The whole game is just a series of moves waiting for someone to make an error, and while that can be said for maybe a whole heck of a lot of games, its just here it feels like that is ALL there is.  Maybe im wrong, and its still interesting for maybe a few games.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (June 2011)

I love Kamisado. The rules can be explained in 5 minutes but the game is very deep. I believe I lost my first 10 games of Kamisado, but the more I play it the best I get (obviously :P), however I still feel I have a long road to travel to master the game, so for me the game has a lot of replayability. Each time I play it I learn something new. Kamisado has a steep learning curve and it is a hard brain burner game (as you have to try to think several turns ahead) which is a huge plus for me :D. The game components are gorgeous although (perhaps) a little overproduced.

On the bad side, the game can bring the worst from my analysis paralysis friends, so perhaps we need to give a limited time to play each turn. If you play at a reasonable speed the game time is relatively short (although you can play the Long and Marathon games mode which increase the game play a lot but also the fun :D).

Before Kamisado I really didn´t care much about abstracts games, but now I pay them more attention.

If you like tactical or abstract games, I really  recommend you to try it, however, in any case, try it before you buy it as some friends of mine have found the game frustrating :devil:.

Kamisado has grown on me and for the time being it's my favourite abstract.
---
Only online play so far. While I'm not good in thinking ahead several turns (and don't like it), Kamisado is a type of abstract I'm fine with. The key is to reduce the movement ability of the opponent while keeping the own mobility, e.g. as in Othello. This leaves opportunity for instinctive play and using general rules instead of planning several turns in advance. The planning itself is brain-draining due to the contra-intuitive function of determining opponents' moving piece by the colour where the own piece ends the turn. Time will tell if this game is strategic enough to offer replay value for abstract fans or if it is not as deep and rather tactical.

Over the years, there have been several entries in the your-move-determines-your-opponents-move categorie of two player abstracts, and Kamisado appears to be one of the better ones. It is certainly the most garish one.

One of the secrets of its success might be the straightforward and easily achievable winning condition of just landing one of your towers on the opponents' base line. This keeps the introductory games mercifully short and prevents Kamisado from being a mere battle of attrition, a trap that other abstracts often tend to fall into. On the whole, I'd probably love if I'd like abstract a bit more in general.

Ötletes játék, de agresszív taktikával (mindig olyan színű mezőre lépek, ami "felnyitja" az ellenfél védelmét az adott bábum előtt) elég nagy arányban lehet nyerni, egy defenzív játékosnak nincs sok esélye a beszorulás miatt. Ha pedig mindkét játékos agresszíven játszik, akkor meg az dönt, hogy ki hibázik először (ki néz be egy lépést). Egy idő után egysíkúvá válik.

It's in the same league with [thing=2655][/thing] for me. Innovative, fast and easy to access, yet complex two player abstract. It scales better in the long run though, since playing a tournament with the advanced rules changes the game gradually, and the long term strategy gets more and more important.

Version info: Burley's original version could cause nausea and severe damage to the optic nerves, and the accessibility issue is solved just partly, yet I was a bit disappointed with the Huch edition. The components are high quality, and the towers are marked with the same characters as the board tiles, so it's more distinguishable for the color blind. The pieces are black and white with colored signs on top. Instead of rings there are clear plastic bits to place on top to promote sumos, but it's very inconvenient. Overall the design is better, still I miss sorely the colorful charm of the original.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
An amusing abstract, however slightly too limited for me - the gameplay is simply locking up your opponent so that he is forced to pick a color that wins you the game before he does the same to you, this reduces the lookahead to something I didn't find all that enjoyable and a bit unwieldy - like a perfect information Tsuro if you would.

A fine if unspectacular game, though I haven't tried all the options for gameplay so maybe - but I doubt it.

The analogy I have come up with is that this is wrestling, and the holds go irresistibly tighter. As the chokes get impossible, you might find that the final lock you planned on your opponent has actually choked you. The one quirk this game has is the possibility of having little hope of winning depending on the random setup of a round.

RATING: 7
Colorful abstract game where players are trying to make it to the other side of the board to gain points and level up their pieces.  Each piece moves like a bishop in Chess but the catch is that the colored square you move onto determines which colored piece your opponent moves next.  Leveled up "Sumo" pieces can push other pieces.  For some reason this game really hits the right spot for me... I like the traps you try to setup.  Since there are so many different possibilities the game can move slow at time.

Sokan hasonlítják a sakkhoz ezt a kiváló absztrakt, kétszemélyes játékot, de kb. azon kívül, hogy 8x8-as a tábla, nem sok köze van hozzá.

Óriási előnye, hogy a három mondatos szabálya fél perc alatt elmondható és a látszattal ellentétben elég mély logikai és stratégiai tervezést igényel, ha valaki jól akarja játszani.

Kezdőknek is tökéletes, hiszen játszani villámgyorsan meg lehet tanulni vele. De jól játszani már sokkal több kell (oké, ebben még hasonlít a sakkhoz).

Olyan, mint egy Volvo. Látod, hogy jól össze van rakva, jól ki van találva, de amíg nem próbálod ki, nem érezheted át, hogy mi van még benne.

És még egy óriási előny a végére: néhány perc alatt lejátszható egy parti (ami persze elhúzódhat sokáig, ha mindkét játékos sokat gondolkozik - lásd sakk).

Bought from Eaglegames.net. Geeked to try this.

Played again. Neat game but frustrating for me. I gave this to Charles as he enjoyed it.

Seems like a pretty typical abstract. A lot of it is avoiding making mistakes, which is not my favourite thing in games. The board is garish and the pieces unpleasant - I suppose I'm too used to the black-and-white elegance of many abstract games (and the Gipf series in particular).

Fans of abstract games will do well to check this one out - it's not a bad game, just something I find simply not that interesting.

Indifferent.

This garishly coloured and way overproduced abstract has been a surprising hit for two player lunchtime gaming.
We can usually manage half a dozen games (we’ve only played the basic rules so far) in the time it takes to scarf down our lunches and each game is quite enjoyable.

The game offers enough complexity to keep it replayable while having pretty simple and straightforward rules. It seems that as we play new strategies are explored and this keeps the experience fresh and engaging. This game has emerged as a ‘standard’ lunchtime game and I can’t see either of us tiring of it in the imminent future.

In all honesty I can’t see myself buying this as my regular lunchtime opponent has a copy and it’s probably a bit too pricey with all that over production (hey, also remember that I need a whole slew of little aeroplanes) but I am unlikely to refuse a game of this.

A really good 2 player game. The pieces and presentation are first rate.
The game could suffer from analysis paralysis if taken too seriously, but if played as any other boardgame and not a chess style replacement, then it is tremendous fun. 
The idea of "handicapping" pieces of the winning player works really well.
RECOMMENDED.

First impression (2 players): It's a 2-player abstract strategy game. I only played "level 1" game with simplest rules. Even that was surprisingly good game. I really liked how your move is liminting the piece opponent can use. This is the type of gameplay I really like in abstracts. I can see that this is a good abstract but I generally don't like to play them and is why I rate them low.

Kamisado sports possibly the most refined mechanic yet to involve a board with multiple colours (eight colours, eight pieces per player, the space a piece lands on determines which piece the opponent will move).

Its basic game is a relatively quick but still deep abstract game that contains more strategy and less tactics than could be expected from a game where your move is dictated by the opponent - to win it's not enough to analyze simple moves, but chains of four or five moves should be taken into consideration. Aggressive play and limiting the player's options are crucial in this regard.

The standard game, involving several rounds of the basic game, adds up another layer of strategy, since the end of a round shapes the setup of the next one. It's then when Kamisado takes full flight.

Really nice "thinky" game... a lighter kind of chess. Each player gets a set of colored pieces and moves them onto colored squares -- the color squareyour piece lands on is the color piece your opponent has to move. 

More enjoyable than chess for me because there aren't those opening gambits and scenarios to memorize. I imagine the game could result in some AP, however, as you try to figure out what move will benefit you next. 

Overall, a nice abstract.

1 perces szabály, de milyen játék! Meglepett a Kamisado, jó értelemben. Egy 1983-as játék újrafeldolgozása. Olvastam már róla mielőtt leültem vele játszani és kicsit féltem, hogy túl sakkszerű lesz. De annál azért jóval egyszerűbb és kevésbé mély játék. Egy Rosenkönignél viszont azért gondolkodósabb. Próbáljuk az ellenfelet olyan helyzetbe hozni, hogy ne tudjon jót lépni, ennyi a feladat, de ez közel sem egyszerű, pontosabban az ellenfél könnyen megelőzhet ebben. Lehet sokat gondolkodni, de szerintem akkor sem lesz vészesen hosszú egy parti, ezért gyorsan lejátszható a játékból több is egymás után. Szeretem az ilyen zseniálisan egyszerű ötletből születő játékokat. A kivitele is impozáns. Több játék után úgy érzem még nőhet a pontszám.

RATING: 5.5
Interesting abstract game, but I'm not a fan of abstracts in general. This one, in particular, is of even less interest: too hard for me to see consequences of my moves, and the between-game setup is a total black box -- Yucata does it for me and I have no idea what's happening, or how I ought to choose left-to-right vs. right-to-left!

--- Summary ---
Abstract game played on a checker-style board with each space in one of 8 different colors. Players have 8 tokens (1/color) starting in their home row. On your turn, move your piece with color matching the space where the opponent's last move ended (eg they end on a green square, you move your green piece). All moves are forward only, straight or diagonal, to any distance ending in an empty space and not jumping over any other piece. The game ends when someone gets their piece to the opposite home row. It's promoted (initially to sumo).

If playing multiple games in the match, set up the board again (using promoted pieces, if any); pieces can be promoted sequentially to double- triple- and quadruple sumo. Each sumo is worth more VP and has greater power to push pieces, but moves shorter distances. 

First player to accumulate previously agreed upon VP total wins.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a purely abstract game with one very simple premise.  On the first turn of the game the start player moves one of his pieces in a straight line any number of spaces stopping on a colored square of the board.  The color of that square dictates which piece the opponent must move on his next turn.  This continues back and forth until a player moves one of their pieces into the back row of their opponent's side of the board.

Very, very simple with (I'm sure) very deep abstract strategy.  However the game is kind of boring to me.  I don't doubt that abstract fans will enjoy the simple ruleset and deep strategy involved here but I personally didn't see a whole lot of strategy.  On your turn you must move a particular piece and at a certain point in the game there are only one or two squares you can even select that won't result in you losing the game.  This makes it easier to think several moves ahead and plan a winning strategy compared to something extremely deep and engaging like Chess.

The sumo towers in the newest edition look pretty neat but I'm actually much more a fan of the sleeker look of abstract games like everything in the GIPF series.  The colors in this one are pretty jarring and it doesn't make for a classical abstract game appearance.  That's probably nitpicking since the whole gameplay is based around different colored squares but still how I feel.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I simply cannot get over how innovative and truly different this game is. If you enjoy strategy games, abstract strategy games particularly, then you owe it to yourself to try this at least once. It's the newest, freshest thing in the genre I've tried in a long time. (Yes, I know I'm a few years out of date on this one. But really... it's a unique, very fresh experience.) One of the few games I've ever played, perhaps one of five games I've ever played, period, that could potentially earn a '10'.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
It's a very simple game with a good strategic feeling. I'm not a huge abstract fan but I do have a couple of favorites in this category like chess and hive. Kamisado is not a part of this very narrow list but it is playable and I like it enough for maybe suggesting it occasionally. Well, maybe not suggesting it but accepting to play it without making a big noise out of it.

RATING: 6
Something about this abstract color-based Chess-like game doesn't connect with me.  It's not bad - and definitely makes you deliberative in your moves, but I wish there were more variables.  The game forces you to constantly consider your opponents next turn, since you determine the piece they will be moving by where you land yourself.  I can see it grow on me over time with repeated plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun abstract game where the location you move a piece to on the board determines what piece your opponent can move. There's a definite learning curve as you play a few games where you can find color patterns that force wins.

Traded it away as Player 2 in my household didn't like it.

RATING: 6
This game is all about look-ahead, which is made more complicated by the color-coded pieces and board. To play well, you need to look ahead a minimum of two moves to avoid pitfalls while simultaneously closing in on enemy pieces to provide your opponent with fewer and fewer options. The long-game, where pieces gain the ability to push others, is also interesting -- especially because greater power is offset by slower movement. I find the game fascinating, but frustrating. Time will tell if my meager strategies will open up the game or leave me feeling lukewarm.

After 5 plays, I haven't really immersed myself in this abstract, and don't know if I ever will.  I definitely prefer some of the GIPF series to this, as they feel more open ended and more like you are progressing to victory.  Kamisado has more of a "sudden death" feel to it.  The components are nice, though the glossy board and gaudy colors may be off-putting to some.

Have played over a few days now, started playing the single games before moving to matches.  I am enjoying the game.  Especially after the first game in a match when the finishing position effects the starting positions on the next.  It is actually a very easy game to play, but the instuctions explain each part of the game, tell you again, and then re-iterate the point.  This makes the instructions long and intimidating but does not allow any room for confusion.  This game will undoubtedly receive plethora of accolades and awards, and deservedly so.

Like any abstract game, you get better by repeated plays and figuring out strategies while avoiding situations where you can get trapped. The big question is: are you willing to devote the time to learn the game.
Kamisado is a beautifully produced game with devilishly simple rules. Move a specific piece forward based on the color of the square your opponent landed on in the previous move. That's it. However the game slowly unfolds as you realize how your moves may create opportunities or trap your opponents without trapping yourself. 

Thus far a thumbs up for simplicity for ease of play

My original version is for trade now, and I'd like to get the Huch-version which comes in a smaller box and has nicer pieces.

One of my favorite abstract "chess clones".  Easy to learn, difficult to master. Plays fast and its easy to teach. Great board and bits. Able to play over and over without growing tired of it.

Clever 'King at the end of the line' abstract. Beautiful pieces. Needs to be played in a multi-game sitting to get the best experience but this isn't a problem as games are quite short.

You can almost feel yourself getting better at [i]Kamisado[/i] the more that you play, which is a strength of the game. Once you’ve played the game a few times, you can start to spot dangerous situations and potential traps, whether or not the opponent is aware of them. Multiple times I recognized at the end of a move that I had given my opponent the opportunity to win a few turns later; sometimes he picked up on those opportunities and other times the game continued without him realizing that he had missed out. I didn’t draw his attention to those situations, but I did learn to avoid putting myself into them in future games. At least I think I did – only more games would prove the point.

Played a bit on yucata to try it out. It's...OK. Seems very tactical and hard to develop a "plan". I like it less the more I play it, though it does have an appealing indirectness.

I'm also not sold on the "sumo" push stuff. I get that it's going for a tradeoff in terms of mobility and power, but it's too rarely interesting or even relevant.

Honestly expected to be culling this from my collection once played, but it was much more enjoyable than I expected. Very simple rules. Big chunky pieces and large board will make it an interesting game for the girls to learn in a few years. Generally a good thinky game for a couple to play when time is limited too.

High marks for an abstract game.  I prefer the Huch box and bits.  Much smaller box and non-garish bits make it easy to identify your units.  The rings from the original were nice but overall, the plastic dragon markers on the tower tops work just fine.

Define F as fun and L length of explanation. Define R = F/L

Kamisado has one of the highest R I have ever found!
Simply genial!

Played this game at Dragonmeet '08. Very good strategic game. Each move directly affects your opponents next move until you can restrict them into a position that benefits your play. Simple concept, but very well realised. My friend was impressed as well and bought a copy on the spot.
The basic game is very sound, but even more impressive are the advanced plays, which really add an extra element the more you get to know the game.

This abstract game takes some thinking, but one short game of 10 minutes is still fun to play, if you don't think too much.

2 player abstract. It's OK, but I'll usually want to play other games.

A lightweight, abstract game that plays quickly, but not too quickly. There is plenty of opportunity for setting up your opponent, but I suspect I'll lose just as many games by doing something stupid because I just didn't see something.

Nice abstract. We only played the version with single rounds (not using the rings). I'd be happy to give this more plays and get a bit deeper into the strategy.

This game is BRILLIANT!  The basic game may well be solvable, but standard and beyond are sufficiently varied to keep us humans busy for a while.

I adore that you can play a basic game, then decide when it's done that you want to turn it into the first round of a standard game, and so on.  The production is ridiculously good, and surprisingly large.

En un tablero similar al del ajedréz pero con colores los jugadores deben avanzar con sus torres de dragón.  No puedes decidir que torre mover, debes mover aquella del color donde quedó la última torre movida por tu adversario. Si logran llegar al otro lado habrán anotado un triunfo.

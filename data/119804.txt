RATING: 7
A fairly quick-playing crayon rail game, pretty straightforward but enough to keep up the interest-- seems like a good introduction to the genre. Doesn't really have anything to get my pulse racing though.

Introductory map to the Empire Builder system does a decent job of introducing you to the basics with a more advanced level before graduating to the other maps in the system.  Components are a bit dated and cheap, but a decent, fast game for 2p and possibly better with 3-4p.

Nice as an intro to the series (for new players), but I found it too simplistic (tho I already know E,pire Builder). Got it to help "indoctrinate" some of my non-traingamer friends. Hope it helps...

Certainly my go-to rails game. Easier set up than Empire Builder since it has pre-made starting layouts. It helps to skip past the early slog to get established.

It's fun, but I think the map is a little too wide open for less than four players. It has shown me that I'd like to try one of the larger Empire games, but I probably won't love the system.

I love this series and I really like this new version. I am pretty sure that when i go back and play an older version I will complain bitterly about the lack of pictures on the cards. 
Very enjoyable.

This is great as a short crayon rails game. It has an introductory scenario built in and you could use that to help out a novice while allowing an experienced player to start from scratch.

I've only played this one time (and it was the beginner game), so take this with a grain of salt. This is a fun and interesting route building, pick-up and deliver game. It's pretty mathy, which I don't mind, but will turn off some people. It has a lot of interesting risk/reward decisions.

I REALLY like the Mayfair crayon rails games and was excited to see this express version for beginners and younger players released.  Unfortunately, I don't think that the simplification makes it that much easier for beginners while reducing the number of options available.

初心者用の基本ルールを4人で遊んだ。
クレヨン鉄道ゲームの入門用として、申し分のない出来栄え。
憶えるべきルールは非常に少なく、かつターン中のステップも分かりやすい。

基本ルールでは常々不満に思っていた初心者向けトラップといえるルール、
　・大都市からの線路の引き方（拡張ルールでは使用する）
　・イベントで切れる線路
　・不要な需要カードの交換
これらがすべて排除されている。大変良い決断だと思う。

難があるとすれば、事前設定されたルートのシンボルがドットの間にあって、歩数を数え間違いやすいということ。この一点を除けば、全てに満足している。

Mayfair社は基本ルールをベースにこれまでのクレヨン鉄道ゲームを遊ぶための差分ルールを発表すると良いと思う。

I very much appreciate all the strategy that goes behind all the "Empire Builder" series of games.  This one is a little more "streamline" than the others but my oldest daughter, now 9, loves it and is really able to grasp it.  It's also a slightly less daunting map since the setting is not far from home (we live in Montreal). 

I look forward to playing others game of Empire Express

"Fantastic light pickup-and-deliver in 20 minutes per player. Perfect intro to crayon rails, with both basic and advanced rules. Great solo."

What I like:
- Quick crayon rails: Basic game 60-90 minutes with 4p (2 newbie casual gamers); Advanced game 45-75 minutes with 3p (1 newbie experienced gamer)
- The Basic Game is fantastic for newbies or quick games
- Contract card design is very nice
- Excellent choices made to streamline the game

What I don't like:
- As with many crayon rails games, there are parts of the map that are rarely profitable
- My boards came somewhat warped, and after I mostly straightened them, they seem to be warping again

Mayfair did a really, really good job with this. For newbies, the pre-built track and great initial contracts ease you into the game. You get about $40m worth of free track, but no money at all. You get 3 contracts that can be delivered without building any additional track. The biggest difference is that the Basic game does not require you to connect major cities. The game works great with the Advanced rules (which are basically normal Crayon Rails rules with a few tweaks). The revised turn sequence (Build-Move-Draw) is fantastic (and should work with other Crayon Rail games).

Games seem to go about 15-30 turns with either the "basic" or "advanced" rules.

The weight for the Basic rules is around 2.0. For the full rules it would be more like 2.5+.

Introduction to the Mayfair crayon rails system. Enjoyable for my wife and I as a 45 minute light game. The rules were easy to grasp (neither of us had any experience with EB games) and the game has a small footprint. A nice balance of strategy and creativity.

My first exposure to Train Games was Empire Builder, which I still love -- but I couldn't be happier with having this version.   The base version is simplified enough that it was easy to teach the family in one go, and thankfully finish a game in a single setting...very important when dealing with kids or meeting somewhere with time constraints.

It turns out they did a great job with the design! It's basically the same game as the other crayon-rails, but with some changes that significantly speed up gameplay:
- smaller map
- pre-printed routes, with specific (and matching) starting contracts (and no per-game building turns)
- contract design greatly improved: only 2 possible deliveries, and now including a map showing the sources for the goods in demand, as well as the destination ... awesome!
- rule change: draw back up to hand of three cards at the END of our turn
- rule change: no need to connect all major cities, although we all did anyway
- rule change: win at just $150

The changes may make for a more random game, rewarding luck of the draw, but it's a great way to introduce the game system to new players! With a game length of 60-90 minutes, it should be much easier to get people to try this game system out! Also, the draw-at-end-of-turn rule can easily be used in the other games, with minimal effect on gameplay. I wish they would switch to the new card design for all the crayon rail games!

Empire Express was intended to simplify the original Empire Builder so that it became more accessible to families and--more importantly--create an entry point into the crayon rail family.  The game fails on both points, if only because it is now so easy to play that it feels like a machine instead of an adventure.  Tension has not been reduced; it's absent altogether.  Way too much rail is already built when you begin.  Dialing down Empire Builder was a difficult task, and it shows.

For many years I searched, seemingly uselessly to find the elusive train game that I liked. There were a few that came along that seemed alright but still not the game that I found I really enjoyed. That is until this. I really had a good time playing this game. It's streamlined and reordered rules make this game flow so much better.

2 is a rating i extremely rarely give to a game.
this means that EE really strikes me as a non-game. Around the table at Essen we all wondered how can such an abysmal experience be packed and sold with the name "game".
The map is an awful  carpet of small dots on which you try to draw lines with crayons and then you  need glasses (stronger than the ones i wear since I was young) to count the movements of your train that goes up and down carrying one or two resources.
This is a conglomerate of boredom we had to abandon after half an hour of agony.
We learned the game on our own at essen so the only possible explanation (other than this game is plainly horrible) is that we couldnt understand a single word of the english rulebook but since we are all very experienced game, I just suppose the reality is that this is just a mayfair blunder

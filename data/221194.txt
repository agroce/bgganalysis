The only real flaw I have personally with the game is the bright design of the game, I would have preferred a more realistic look but I can say that is a personal preference. 

That aside, the game is amazing. It is Jurassic Park in a box and even with the long game at 4 players it plays quickly and does not outstay its welcome. 

Just a fun time building your personal Jurassic Park story. Highly recommended.

I like it!  Solid, multi-faceted worker placement+.  I like how the different parts fit together to form something interesting and varied.  Works very well!

I'd rate it higher except I think it overstays its welcome a bit.  Just a little long for what it does.  There is enough randomness (tiles, cards, visitors) that I feel like it should be a shorter game.  But it isn't.  And it's still fun and thematic and awesome.

I REGRET NOTHING!  ...except not putting an extra padlock on the T-rex paddock.  That might have been a mistake.  Then again, they were hungry and the visitors had already paid for admission...  Eh, nothing the janitorial staff can't clean up!

Super fun. The color scheme doesn't bother me (it definitely reminds me of Jurassic Park merchandise). I like the different phases and how all the systems connect. I do wish the dinosaurs had some differences or were unique in some way besides DNA cost, but that's a minor quibble. The variety in the game is excellent and the deluxe components are top notch.

This game is a lot of fun!  Some of the rules are a little confusing and hard to understand but the FAQ helped to clear some things up for me.  I would recommend it to others, there are so many cool parts and pieces and multiple mechanics which make it really enjoyable

RATING: 6
Two plays at two players so far, one short, one medium.  The medium game was over in three rounds.  My wife and I really enjoy playing games, but we also like winning them and are very competitive when playing against each other.  The objectives being the end game mechanic was a miss for us.  We focused on those knowing "If I don't do it, he/she will" because the other player is quickly locked out of those points.  You grab those objectives, end the game, and win!  We are going to give it another play through with the long objectives without putting a house rule on anything and see how it goes.  I will adjust my rating accordingly.

If the long game fails us, we may need to separate out the "easy" objectives, turn the objective into end game bonuses and just play a certain amount of rounds, or require all objectives to be completed to end the game.  Best case is someone far more creative than us will come up with a good variant end game that this game needs/deserves.

I have only played the "Short" game so I may be unfair in my rating; however, in the short game I found the turn order to be overly punitive especially when players stayed within 0-2 points of each other. In addition in the games I've played it was very apparent who the winner would be at ~50% of the games completion.

I love the quality of the components especially in the Kickstarter edition (metal coins, a slap bracelet, etc.). The theme is engaging and satisfying. Also, there's a lot of interesting variations between games depending on the "plot twist" cards and the game length that you choose.

RATING: 7
the theme of the game is very good, but I found the first player to have too strong of a position on the game, especially early turns or where by chance good things come out. Maybe in a longer game it would be more balanced and more positioning for turn order  would be possible.

Game is sooooo complex! You count patrons, dna, dinosaurs... Plenty of brain fittness. Luckily rules come natural. I watched one yt video and had to look into rules once. Box is worth twice the penies I spent on it ;-) Only issue I have with it are large/small carnivores - their cost in dna is almost the same, but small ones give way less VP.

Is a fine game, happy to have backed it, but too many issues for me. Can't truly understand why the first 3 phases weren't designed to be on 1 aesthetically pleasing game board. Seems easy enough to do. Simultaneous Phase 4 and scoring is a cluster. Misprints and rules translations are a distraction. And, finally, carnivore recipes may be surefire path to victory. Just not as fun as I'd hoped it to be.

Great, crunchy euro game with an amazing theme. Think Roller Coaster Tycoon, but its Jurassic Park instead of Six Flags. There are multiple strategies to pursue: More attractions or Dinosaurs? Dangerous or safe Dinosaurs? Pursue the end game objectives or optimize your park? Specialists? An upgraded lab? All that is available to you and how you can mix and match it to make a park that is truly your own, and still compete make this game a winner. JP is also one of my favorite movies, so I may be a bit biased...

In "Dinosaur Island" you take on the role of a corporation starting a dinosaur theme park akin to Jurassic park. You use worker placement and variable upgrades as well as a dice based economy, to research new dinosaurs, breed dinosaurs, and increase your security to prevent dinosaurs from escaping and eating people. 

This is a fairly thematic euro with a strong 90's vibe as seen by the obvious references such as "The Clever Grille" and "Jurassic Pork", and the neon color scheme which I personally enjoy a lot in this game. My only cons so far, are that the short game is too short (easily avoided by playing medium or long) and the dinosaurs are too similar in cost and reward for each level, and I'd like to see way more dinosaurs with a lot more variety. 

That first con is easily avoided and the second could very well be fixed by an expansion (which is rumored to be announced this march). All in all I enjoyed this game for its theme and mechanics, and while there are a lot of moving parts for a gateway level gamer, it is actually easily explained and the phases make sense with minimal rule look-ups. I'd recommend it.

A really wonderful game. Designed well, mechanics work well together, a good mix of dynamics, and the colours are beautiful!
My only criticism is the rulebook. It is text heavy with a poor font choice and not clear about many rules and specifics about cards.
However it is my new favourite game and definitely recommend it!

2017. 1-4p, 90-120 min.  Pretty fun game of worker placement.  The randomness of the DNA dice and the customers/hooligans is a bit of a turn-off, but overall it's one of the better games of 2017 for me.

Backed out of KS.  When a dino kills one of your visitors, the repercussions are too small (-1 VP)... and then next round everyone goes round their business like nothing happened.

Tabulative. Multiplayer solitaire. Questionable balance. Overproduced dinosaurs and dice. Another standard worker placement. Getting dinosaur DNA is just a worker getting one pink cube a la Caylus. Yawn.

Il y a beaucoup à penser dans ce jeu. Les 4 phase se font bien et sont bien défini, mais il faut que tu penses à tes phase future pour bien réaliser ta phase présente. Il est vrai que les meeple et dinomeeple en plastique sa fait un peu "Cheap" mais on passe vite outre ça.
DE plus, cette boite contient 2 jeux en un. Le deuxième consiste à tout remettre dans la boite pour qu'elle ferme correctement.

I love dinosaurs! But not so much worker placement games. So I was a bit scared of the game, I mean lots of components etc, but it plays really smoothly and it's great fun! Every one I played with has been enjoying, even people not so keen on board games: the theme here helps a lot. The plot twists and different objectives cards keep the game fresh. Also you can choose the length of the game, and that's sweet. Short is a bit too short but perfect for introducing the game to new people. GAO (for those who get it).

After all these years we finally get a Jurassic Park themed board game! The game uses worker placement for you to gather DNA, create dinosaurs, and build up your park to attract visitors. The gameplay incorporates the theme very well and it really feels like you're building up your own Jurassic Park. The game also has a ton of replayability with the all the cards, buildings, random goals, and even the short, medium, and long game options. Unfortunately I'm just not a fan of the color palette used for the game, it was a bit distracting. I was also really disappointed by the fact that the dinomeeples (in the Deluxe version) are all made from pink plastic and the various species are interchangeable. I never thought I would say that but the metal coins are also a bad design choice. Too thick and too heavy and I wish they were of different size or at least show the denomination on both sides so we wouldn't have to sift through to find the right coins. I wish the production had been a lot better but the gameplay is strong enough to recommend the game to fans.

I’ve played once solo. I’m rather I’m pressed. I can totally see this as a fun and high pressure worker placement. 

Main downside to me is the artwork. It just bugs me and honestly takes me out of the game. Maybe some tiny dinosaur figure replacements will  help. 

The game is great. The art is horrible. Still one of the best kickstarters I’ve ever backed.

Tremendously enjoyed playing this game. While there are quite a few options, some of which you cannot forget about and some that require you to keep an eye on what other players are doing, they are not overwhelming or hard to understand.

I love the theme in this and the game has a lot going for it to make it feel like Jurassic Park. Our medium length game took about 90 minutes and I thought that was a fair length for a first play. I definitely want to play this again and see how new objectives and plot twists change how we play the game. My one concern is this game feels somewhat disjointed in the phases as there is worker placement, dice drafting, action selection, chit-pull, and resource management. It's a lot to teach and take in, fortunately some of this can be done simultaneously to move the game along once everyone knows the rules. I imagine the first few plays will take some rule lookup since while the game boards do a fairly good job of keeping the game moving there are a few odd things missing that require going to it each round. I also don't like the chit-pull mechanism in terms of the luck it adds to an otherwise strategic game. I'm not over the moon like everyone else seems to be, but I definitely want to play this again real soon.

After reading some more it turns out we got a rule wrong in our 1 play. We were not giving $1 for each patron that came out of the bag, only the 1 VP or $2 based on them being placed and surviving from being eaten. That maade the economy really tight to where we were almost never buying anything so another play is definitely in order now.

Have played the non-deluxe version and it's really good fun. Requires enough focus to stay competitive but it's nowhere near as brain burning as Caverna or similar heavier worker placement games.

Unrelated to the game downside: It seems Australia Post have lost my Deluxe edition. That or it was stolen off my doorstep. Aetherworks are being helpful and pushing AP to investigate/respond so hopefully it'll turn up soon. Though after playing the (still packed full of goodies) standard version I might trade my Deluxe version for a rare wishlist game & purchase the standard edition later on.

Own the deluxe version and the game looks wonderful all laid out on the table.  The coins feel wonderful in your hand, and also just look amazing.  Overall excellent production quality, and really you gotta love that snap bracelet.  Even the base pieces look nice, but deluxe is where it's at.  Sumptuous.

Only played the one game so far but it seems that the variability of set-up will keep it fresh through more than a couple plays.  The passing of scientists in the first phase gives you lots of flexibility early during worker placement.  Speaking of which, worker placement is generally nice and fast since it's all done simulataneously.  Once you've built all that lovely coin up you're gonna have to decide where that money has to go.  Well that's the real challenge.  Lab upgrades, more shops, specialists, or just buying more DNA for  dinosaurs?  However when placing stuff on your board... not so important. Perhaps tile placement bonuses, restrictions, etc. would be a great thing to look at for future expansions.  In the end nothing seemed too OP, and only one or two of the specialists/lab upgrades ever felt kinda weak, so balance seems to be pretty good too!  Overall good job everyone involved, glad I backed this one on Kickstarter!

Played 3 times so far, hopping to get a couple more in within the next month (and possibly trying the solo play mode). Very enjoyable, and love the inclusion of variable length goals. The game looks intimidating because of the sheer size and number of pieces (my non-gaming gf almost wrote it off) but once you start playing it is actually very straight forward, and I would only say it is slightly more complex than Lords of Waterdeep. Some errors in the rulebook did cause a little confusion, but nothing that common sense couldn't sort out (and was later confirmed by reading the FAQ here).

This is a really good worker placement. There's lots of decisions to be made in the game in order to build your park. The instructions are well written and the game is easy to understand.  We didn't have the reference the rule book much after we got it set up for our first play. The short game played in about 75 minutes. The long game is about 2.5 hours. There might be a little run away leader in this game and you keep benifiting each round and building onto it.

Reality vs hype... I love the theme (who doesnt?) and I can't deny the worker placement mechanics are solid... However, there are some problems:

1) The design: Not talking about the colors (I am ok with it), but the game seems bigger than necessary, with more elements than necessary and it takes the whole table. In special, the market board seems to be quite poorly designed (quite awkward)

-2 ) The flow:  I quite dislike the multi-phase approach when there are just too many phases (5 phases)... it makes the experience quite choppy and make the experience feel like work. 

Overall and unfortunately it feels more bloated, choppy and clunky then it needed to be... But the theme is awesome...

[b]The theme:[/b] In [thing=221194][/thing], you build your own Jurassic Park. You hire specialists, make various kinds of more or less exciting dinosaurs and build security so they don't eat your visitors. Although there are many rules and stuff, everything is connected with the theme so well, it is very easy to explain and understand.

[b]The components:[/b] Although the cardstock and everything is nice, knowing there is a deluxe version with all the different kinds of dinosaurs, the standard edition seems inferior. I hope to get the deluxe one on the KS for the expansion :)

[b]The fun:[/b] [thing=221194][/thing] is a worker placement game so it is fun for people who like this kind of games. And I do so yay for me :) There is no direct confrontation and every spot can only be claimed once but you also have your own board and there, nobody can mess with you which is nice. And it is not the kind of game where I would need direct confrontantion so I don't miss it at all.

[b]The gameplay:[/b] At the start of the game, you can choose how long you want it. And I would never again play the short and medium game, because it is just too unsatisfying. You also have a few different little rules every game which is very nice. At its core, the game is a multi-layered worker placement game, where you first place workers on the public board, then you choose out of some public options and then you place workers on your own personal board. You then get some paying and unpaying visitors in your park and your score for those (unless they get eaten :devil: ).

It was a bit frustrating that the short game was so very short (3-4 turns maybe :yuk:) It felt like it was over just as you were getting into the game and working out how it played. I think we will be jumping straight into the long game next play through.

Overall I did really enjoy what little game we played and everyone was beginning to grasp mechanics and starting to build engines. It probably would have been a good game at twice the length we played. 

I love the theme and the 80's colour clash of the artwork is fab, the dinomeeples are cool and the player board being indented so cubes don't get knocked everywhere is well done.

Cute and silly game that unfortunately makes the idea of a Dinosaur Island more stupid rather than layered and complex.  The dinosaurs have no dignity; they are just a bunch of numbers.  Some aspects should have really been adjusted thematically (ie DNA die threat level, in what universe would people go to a park where they are likely to be eaten/die, patrons are more likely to die but then have a similar chance of getting eaten in future rounds, no sense of discovery with DNA & dinosaurs...) to make more sense and fun in a theme-centric game.  For example, one simple idea includes adding more patron types (ie those who are weaponized) which could amp up the excitement and the richness of the theme.  Despite the negatives, there are redeeming qualities such as end game flexibility, paddock upgrading, the general sense of people lining up to see attractions, and the use of other non-dinosaur type attractions.  It just isn't thematically or mechanically rewarding enough for me to care about.

Aus dem Popcornbecher wurde ein Eimer und Nachos mit Käsesosse eroberten das Kino: Spielbergs Jurassic Park hob das Blockbuster Kino Anfang der 90er in die neue Ära von Multiplex. Die Amiboys Jonathan Gilmour und Brian Lewis müssen Fans gewesen sein, denn schon das Popart-Cover von DINOSAUR ISLAND zitiert Film und Zeit. Der knallschrille 90er Look ist unübersehbar eine Reminiszenz. Sogar die Bernsteinmücke als Gen-Quelle findet Platz auf der Schachtel. Die Idee aus Fragmenten von Dinosaurier-DNA neue Dinosaurier zu erzeugen ist der thematische Kern des Spiels, das auch beim Öffnen der Schachtel breites, amerikanisches Bubblegum verströmt: der Trash zieht sich durch alle Spielkomponenten bishin zu den altbonbonfarbenen Plastikmeeples und den pinkrosa Dinosaurier. Aus sechs DNA-Strängen klont man sich im Spiel Pflanzen- und Fleischfresser aus der Jura-Zeit, um im inhabergeführten Themenpark Besucher anzulocken, die Geld und Siegpunkte bringen. Und natürlich wächst mit den Dinosaurier auch die Dangerzone und die Visitors drohen von den Urzeittieren gekillt zu werden, wenn man nicht aufpasst und nicht mitrechnet. Im diametralen Gegensatz zur Schönheit der absichtlichen Hässlichkeit von DINOSAUR ISLAND ist sein Kern volksdurchschnittliche Rechenarbeit. Zudem wirkt das Spiel typisch kleinverlagsunfertig und die Regel weist doch erhebliche Interpretationslücken auf. Ausserdem riecht es schwer nach Startspielervorteil. Das Beste am Spiel ist und bleibt tatsächlich das kreative Spiel mit der Populärkultur. Nach Zombies dürften Dinosaurier die zweitbeliebteste Popspezies der Welt sein. In diesem Sinne ist der hakelige Taschenrechner-Mechanismus zweitrangig. DINOSAUR ISLAND ist ein Eurotrash-Popcornspiel mit Schieflage, das möglicherweise genau diejenigen langweilen wird, die mit Pop weniger anfangen können oder gut mit den Grundrechenarten Addition, Substraktion, Division und Multiplikation unterwegs  sind und das Spiel recht schnell beherrschen/durchschauen dürften. DINOSAUR ISLAND ist ein Stück Eiskonfekt-Kino in einer übrigens am Ende ziemlich vollgestopften Schachtel, deren Konfektion versagt hat und gegen ein professionell austariertes Spiel jenseits von personal Fandome kaum bestehen wird.

I liked Dinosaur Island! I'm the type of guy who is a sucker for the Jurassic Park theme, so there's a big plus for me there. The mechanisms all worked well together and were divided into clear phases: research, park development, worker getting stuff done, attracting visitors, and general cleanup. A nice amount of variety is built in, with different upgrades, specialists, and "plot twists" making an appearance each game. It can get quite mathy and grock-y which kinda messes with the pacing, but it's not too bad and I'm sure would clear up with repeated plays. You can definitely waste turns gaining too much of one thing you don't need or being one shy of that which is essential; so careful planning and being efficient is pretty much the name of the game! Some of the luck of the draw with what appears can be aggravating, depending on player order decided by points on the board, even if other players are doing much better with end game points. There's motive to not scoring so many immediate points and instead building for an end-game burst. I don't really like the art style, which is a small thing, but it's enough to mention. The fact the retail edition (as apart from the KS edition) doesn't come with the different dinosaur pieces is a huge shame as the theme of park building is such a big draw that having only one type of dinosaur figure is a detraction. Those points aside, I think the different phases are different enough and interesting enough that I feel motivated to play this again and do better next time. I just wish they might have gone with a different visual approach that wasn't so "Sim City on a CGA monitor" look.

Very tentative rating, after one play. Components are fun to behold, but game play was kind of disappointing. Felt like very standard-fare worker placement. The attractions were fairly bland, and going from phase to phase I felt more tedium than fun. Maybe I was just really tired or not in the mood; will have to try again with more people to see if the fun factor appears.

Full disclosure, I was a playtester. There's a lot to like in this game as it has many tensions: how to spend your money to generate money, visitors, vps, and scoring objectives. There are subtleties in expanding storage, choosing and prioritizing dinosaurs, getting special abilities, and especially when you try to go full tilt into becoming a major theme park that is turning over visitors and therefore vps. The artwork and production are not for everyone --I can see liking it or finding it garish. I personally would have preferred more functional, less busy, artwork that gave a nod to Jurassic Park and other inspirations. Like any highly thematic game, it's tough to balance rules economy with having many game attributes and tensions. The chaos is surprisingly limited, as most of it comes from visitor draws, and managing security, both of which have many ways to mitigate. Jonathan Gilmour has impressed me as a designer who has a wide range, creative mind, and practicality to what makes a game enjoyable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The bad, the good, and the ugly. 

Components are a mixed bag of mostly bad.  The artwork,  is what it is,  but is not too off putting to me.  The plastic, however, I'm not a fan of.  Also, since the dinosaurs are basically only three types I would have preferred the dinomeeples match up one to one with the "recipes". The way they did it feels like a design flaw.  The coins, while decently designed(boring looking), are SO THICK that they are overwhelmingly heavy and I worry they could damage components or the box.  Being twice as thick as every other metal coin out there was a negative for me not a positive.

Gameplay is almost all positive.  The plot twists and different end game goals should give this one some legs. Managing your security is not easy or straight forward.  I was super happy that almost everyone got some guests eaten.  It was a significant part of the game instead of easily managed.  All the phases and ways to improve your abilities and park felt intuitive and smooth. Pacing and gameplay are great.  Turns are quick and the game ends before you run out of things you want to do.  The thought of what I want to do in future plays stayed with me for a while. I will be very excited to explore this game further.

I am dissapointed that slap bands, pogs, and meaningless crap were added to the game instead of a straight forward quality production.  The plastic has sink holes and doesn't feel quality to handle.  The money is so thick the cardboard feels better, especially with feather light plastic instead of the "should have been" wood.

The gameplay overcomes the publishing problems so yay for the designers and boo for the publisher.  Rating is for the design.

Dinosaur Island is classic feeling worker placement tableau builder.. Less sandbox than Caverna and similar titles, Dinosaur Island offers a few nuances to the genre that gives it a unique feel. In lieu of feeding workers, players are required to manage the expansion of their park through threat. More dinosaurs mean more potential victory points but also mean a greater threat. When threat exceeds security level, dinosaurs break free and eat patrons leading to a loss of potential points. 
Additionally, the game adds objective cards that nicely change up the game and define its length each play. Ranging from short to long games, objectives give a rice-like feel to claim goals and trigger end game. Dinosaur Island's slight thematic-inspired twists on tried and true sandbox worker placement mechanics shine. More so, the theme is expertly integrated in a way that this game, while much heavier than gateways, offers an extremely approachable system. Everything makes sense, and everything is fun to build towards.

Thoroughly enjoy this game! Aside from the awesome theme and amazing art design it offers a straight forward game play over quick phases. The game looks so much heavier than it really is which is very nice. Set up isn’t ridiculous and it has an eye catching table presence. The variability is high between length options and plot twist added on top of the different times specialist, dinosaurs and buildings come out. This game shines on so many things we enjoy and look forward to many plays of this. Curious to explore many different paths to victory.

Kickstarter Deluxe. Component quality is among some of the best out of any game I own.

Component quality and presentation are amazing. Shelf presence is great.

Played one time so far at 3 players. Overall played pretty well. Stumbled a bit through the first couple of rounds, but by round 3 everyone was in full swing. Played on Short Game Length. 

I'm interested to play again. So far, if I had to pick from my own collection to pick a worker placement game for a board game night, I'd probably prefer to play New Bedford or Charterstone. That said, if someone else suggested or wanted to play Dinosaur Island, I wouldn't say no and would enjoy playing again.

A beautifully produced game with an interesting and well-integrated theme.

This game has a unique aura to it. The theme is very strong and the 80s inspired art direction is phenomenal. It's nostalgic and it has a hint of auto-irony to it that shines through the card illustrations and the bright colors. The game also has great adaptability with options to go from a short to a longer game which is a big plus. The gameplay is solid, well balanced and it's extremely simple to teach because every mechanic is thematic and makes logical sense.

I don't think it deserves all the praises it gets. Sure the theme is great and the visual design is awesome. The Kickstarter exclusive edition components are great; however, I'm not so certain that the retail box is really worth the price. 

The game is quite average. I've been entertained for the first 30 minutes, but I quickly realized how similar the different dinosaurs were. It didn't matter if it were a t Rex or a Brontonosaurus; all that mattered is that it was worth 7 points each and they needed a specific DNA. 

I enjoyed it but I'm glad they let the players select the game time. I think it can be fun up to an hour and a half max; 2 hours is too long for its complexity.

Overall, I was disappointed; I expected more variety from it. Two of the 4 phases are very dry and simplified worker placement; there is not much tension out of them too.

Dinosaur Island is an ok-to-good game that needs an expansion or two to make it great.  

Pros:

--Brings some of the fun of Jurassic Park to the tabletop in a reasonable way
--Familiar mechanics to those who have played games like Agricola
--Learning curve not too steep
--Variable game lengths with short/med/long end game objectives

Cons:

--Seriously disappointing components.  The game is about DINOSAURS.  When I build a T-Rex or Raptor for my park, I want to put a fearsome T-Rex or Raptor in my park, not a puny hot pink triceratops (retail game all dinos are the same triceratops).  Real let down.  Also, the meeples are poor plastic quality.  Overall, the game would benefit from a significant component upgrade (even advanced Kickstarter version doesn't appear to correct that problem, although I don't own it -- just from looking online).  I've ordered small dinosaur miniatures to solve this problem, but I was disappointed for sure.

--Not innovative.  If you're looking for something new or different, the mechanics are all lifted from other popular games.  Nothing new here, not really.

--When carnivores breach security in the park, they don't really run amok.  That is the best part of Jurassic Park movies.  In this game they eat a couple visitors and then all is good.  If a T-Rex gets loose in your park, there should be ongoing significant consequences.

--The dinosaurs require different DNA inputs to create but then are all the same in terms of what they do for you (visitors, victory points, etc.).  All herbivores are the same, all small carnivores are the same, all large carnivores are the same.  Same, same, same.  Requires different DNA for a T-Rex or Allasorous, but, once built, they are identical in terms of what they do for you.  Would like to see a unique characteristic/attribute for each dinosaur.

After one medium-length play, I was surprised how few rounds we ended up with as the objectives were completed quickly. By others. I wasn't paying attention to them as I was building a cool park. Even though I was playing an empire building strategy in a race game, I still had fun.

Mutli-phase resource management dinosaur amusement park game. How could this not be great? Well, it is great.

It reminds me of a heavy Vlaada Chvatil game (Dungeon Lords/Dungeon Petz), only at the weight of about The Manhattan Project. If I still had The Manhattan Project, this would fire it.

It has multiple strategic directions you can go without having a game that rewards you points for sneezing at the right time. It looks crazy and that appeals to me, though some coloration has issues and some graphic design could be improved.

There is a combination of worker placement, action selection and tableau building, while managing your threat level with your excitement (which is also your scoring potential). Huge replayability with a variety of buildings, dinosaurs and plot twists (cards which change a rule or two for each game).

Absolutely loved this game. From the high production quality, tight mechanics, and engrossing theme, Dinosaur Island was my most anticipated game of 2017 and may very well end up being my game of the year soon. Will have a top 10 of 2017 very soon and we will see where it ends up! We gave it a high review.

We absolutely love this game! It is in my top 5 easily! It has a lot of moving parts which can be overwhelming and you will need table space for set up. The rules were easy to learn and iconography is really helpful. We only had to reference the rules for set up and first round of play, which was very nice. No cheat sheet needed! The components were all very high quality too. I can't say enough good things about this game!

Absolutely gorgeous game! I wasn't sure from the pictures whether I would like it or not, but it looks great. But it's not just eye candy - there is a lot of game in it! Lots of variability, good theme integration, and a decent amount of strategic options available. Though, it does take a lot of table space and setup + rules explanation takes some time. Still, the rules themselves are rather easy to remember during the game as everything is nicely written on the boards. The game maybe a bit too tight on the economic side for my taste (having to use workers just to get money is boring) but maybe I just sucked hard in my first game.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I kind of like the plastic and the colors of this one as it somehow fits the theme and helps evoke it to some degree. I would have preferred more specialization in the dinosaurs and making more meaning behind the needs and rewards of the different types, but I understand the desire to keep it simple. This is really a pretty easy game to pick up and teach/play. The gene dice create a bit of uncertainty in acquiring the needed genes but even that can be mitigated with other options. The plot cards also make sure each game plays out quite differently as do the goals to some degree. Be aware that the medium game likely ends in under 6 rounds if people are playing somewhat competently so don't spend too much time building up your engine.

One of the best games I picked up in 2017.  This is essentially Jurassic Park the board game, just without the IP.  Got the deluxe version off KS and the included metal coins are the nicest I've ever seen.  All the components are great and I've had quite a few people comment on how nice the oversized clear amber dice are.  Love the double layered lab boards with the cut outs for all of the DNA storage cubes.  Game publishers need to take note as this was one of my favorite features of Scythe when it came out in 2016.  Variety of dinosaur meeples is very nice however there is not a corresponding meeple for each species of dinosaur included in the game.  

Game play is great and really rewards careful forward planning.  Was a bit difficult to teach to casual gamers but after a round or two they caught on and everyone really enjoyed playing.  My only slight grievance with the game is that it seems to really punish the player in the lead.  Going first in turn order is extremely beneficial as you get first choice on dinosaur recipes and then again when purchasing lab upgrades, attractions or specialists.  Pretty much every time I have played, the person in last place during the game ends up winning in the end as they snag up all the best upgrades and eventually their VP engine really takes off.  I've only played on the "short" game mode so I'm thinking this won't be as much of an issue with the "medium" or "long" game modes.  Having an adjustable play time is also a really nice feature.

However, I would have liked to see some variability among each class of dinosaur.  All the large carnivores provide the same level of attraction (3), the same VP per dinosaur (7) and have the same threat level (2).  The same goes for the small carnivores and herbivores.  I would have liked to see some variability between the threat level, attraction and VP per dinosaur within each class but this may have thrown off the balance of the game.  The only difference between 2 large carnivores will be the DNA required to create them.  

I also noticed that there seems to be less benefit to snagging a small carnivore as they generate the same threat level as the large carnivores but attract significantly less visitors and have a lower VP value per dinosaur when compared to the large carnivores.  Every game we have played, no one wanted to take a small carnivore unless they were short on dinosaur recipes and had no other choice left.

Overall, an absolutely great game and I highly recommend picking up a copy if your a fan of Jurassic Park, dinosaurs, or resource management style games.  The components are top shelf and the game play is extremely rewarding.

So much fun! The 90s kid in me is lovin on this theme, and the psychedelic design. That said, I do think there is potential to take this from an 8 to a 10, especially with later expansions (hopefully coming???). Adding a little more complexity would be awesome, and more interactive. My one gripe is the production quality: not loving the retail-version of the scientist, or the weak box (the side of ours ripped the first day we got it! Those player boards are quite heavy!).

This has all of the looks and trappings of a boilerplate cube-pusher/worker placement game with a cool theme skinned on, but after bringing this to the table a few times, I was pleasantly surprised at how well everything flows together in this game.

There are a lot of decision points and things to keep track of, but the theme does a very good job of making those interlocking pieces "click" into place, without needs multiple playthroughs to have everything make sense. 

Segmenting the decision points into two small "take turns" phases, a longer "all play" phase, and a "let's see how it all shakes out" phase is brilliant. There's little downtime between decisions in those earlier phases since they're impactful and important but not complex. 

Once that's done, everybody is able to solitaire it for actually managing their park. The only time this is really an issue is in teaching the game, but even doing a round or two of take turns solves this before turning everyone loose.

Even the resolution phase, which is usually something that players generally don't care about (outside of scoring/who's winning purposes) is fun and interesting with the addition of the hooligans and in seeing if your opponents had a dinosaur outbreak and guests got eaten.

Yes, it's still a Euro, but the theme and narrative meshes perfectly here. I can still recall past games by speaking about them purely thematically, which is an impressive feat, as I would weigh this game on the heavier side of moderate.

One other thing that's been a nice selling point is that it's fairly easy to correct past mistakes, as there are several options for crossover actions (acquiring DNA in later phases, converting scientists to workers, etc.) and in giving trailing players first dibs on actions with the variable turn order.

Usually, gateways tend to skew towards light fare, but this is definitely a great gateway for introducing players to the heavier side of Euros and stands as a great midweight game for veterans.

I'm not a huge worker placement fan, but I backed this on Kickstarter because of the theme and the promise of avoiding a "point salad" approach. It didn't disappoint. The mechanics and theme fit extremely well - bigger, badder dinos attract more people to your park, which leads to more VP, but also more risk to the park attendees, which loses you VP. You're always balancing building your best park or (occasionally) going for big point dinos at the expense of an eaten guest or two. The theme+rules flow just makes sense despite the seemingly overwhelming setup. I'd recommend watching someone play or watching a video to learn this game. The rulebook is a better reference than a teacher.

First of all I LOVE the theme and the 80's look of the game. The components are excellent. The game itself is a pretty straight forward worker placement game. It is very streamlined because of the fases which are played on the different boards. In the end it is all about getting dna, purchasing upgrades, making dino's and managing your security. The objective cards don't work in my opinion, they are the trigger for the end of the game. I played a 4 played game with the medium length objectives and it was over after 4 rounds, totally felt like an anti-climax. I played a 2 player long game that never seemed to end, overstayed it's welcome. This just doesn't work for me and I really dislike it. The game is a good worker placement, but it lacks something special in the mechanics. The theme and the components couldn't save this game for me. Sold it after two plays.

The production of the Deluxe version is insane... the box is super heavy and should be a little bigger. 
Money is really tight in this one and the "race" aspect of the game regarding the Goals that are in play can be an "issue" to some players.
The game has great variability but one thing that didn't feel right was that the threat and excitement  level of the Dinosaurs is the same for all dinosaurs in the same "tier" it's a bit strange...
Other than that the game plays smoothly and has very interesting mechanics

A solid 9 after only one 2-player play. I really want to experience it at all player counts, and try the long game. The theme goes to 11, and the components (Deluxe version) are out of this world. The only reason it's not a 10 is the game is a little fiddly, and I normally like playing with my game pieces. The Park and Cleanup phases require a bit too much moving around of pieces to be considered super smooth.

However, I would like to see different dinosaur meeples like in the KS. I also feel as though this game ends abruptly (even in the long game). At least with the people I play with.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]I've been fascinated by dinosaurs since I was little so I had high expectations for Dinosaur Island. Out of the box I thought the components in the deluxe version are amazing and I really like the aesthetic of the game, although I'm not as keen on some of the artwork [i](especially the buildings)[/i]. 

Unfortunately after a couple of plays I was underwhelmed and disappointed with the actual game play; it doesn't have the depth/complex decision space that I expected considering the lengthy set up time and large amount of table space it requires. Once Dinosaur Island is laid out on the table you would expect it to be a complex game, but in actuality it is a relatively simple and straight forward game [i](it appears to be similar in weight to a game like Feast for Odin, but plays like Stone Age)[/i]. A huge part of my issue with the game is how generic the dinosaurs and buildings are. There are three categories of dinosaurs and buildings,however each dinosaur/building in a category is functionally the same [i](for example all small carnivores will score the same exact VP for visitors and the total amount of that dinosaur you have end game)[/i]. Thematically Dinosaur Island falls flat because of the lack of variety; which dinosaurs you choose to breed is inconsequential, the only difference is what DNA you need to collect. How can a Stegosaurus score the same amount of VP as a Hadrosaurus?! [i](Everyone knows Stegos are way cooler and will draw more visitors)[/i]!  
 
Dinosaur Island is close to being a great game, I really like the diversity of helpers you can hire and the different lab upgrades offer some different ways to achieve certain goals. I just can't get past how generic the dinosaurs are, that is what the game is about and yet they are the most boring part of the game. You also never really feel like you're building this amazing theme park, the pacing of the game is very stagnant. Dinosaur Island just isn't a game that will hit the table in my house. If I am going to commit to a game with this amount of set up I want to play a much heavier game. Regrettably Dinosaur Island will be leaving our collection, I'm not interested in waiting for, nor spend money on, an expansion to fix the problems I have with the game. I have a feeling this will be my biggest disappointment of the year because I was so hyped for the game.[/i]

Dinosaur Island is a multi-stage eurogame about building a Jurassic Park-style theme park. During the various phases of the game, players must collect dinosaur DNA, build dinosaur pens, create the dinosaurs, build other attractions, increase security, and actually deal with the visitors that come to their park. While the game does encompass a lot of different steps, most of it is drafting, and it all seems to fit together very well. The game operates around a number of different balance points, including dinosaur "threat level" versus security, visitors that come to your park versus the amount of space you have for them, and of course managing your resources (DNA) and money. So, while there's not one mechanism that particularly stands out, it's very engaging just trying to balance everything and keep the wheels spinning. A very solid game.

Fun game that felt like Jurassic Park.  There seemed to be many options and paths for the worker/scientist placements.  This game was rich in theme.  I liked how one had to plan for threat level based on the DNA and dinos.  The hooligans were a nice touch as well.  I appreciated it had a basic and advanced game, too.  The deluxe componets were great.

The game took awhile to get going and also was fiddly in some rules and components.  The hooligans/VIPs were not defined.  There was a lot of things to keep track of with lab upgrades, specialists, attractions, plot twists, and objectives.

I was surprised to find this turned out as awesome as it looked! The game play was fun, and the variable game lengths are great for teaching in addition to providing a way to change strategies (along with the goals that go with each game length).

My one complaint is the dinos, I really wish there was a set for each unique dinosaur, because it felt weird putting the wrong shaped dinosaur on each tile. I would gladly pay for a set of dinos in packs of 4 that map with each of the types.

Love this theme! Who hasn't wanted to create their own version of Jurassic Park? This game nails that feeling.

This game has a lot going for it. It's essentially a engine building game, where you spend scientists to take DNA or dinosaur recipes, then upgrade your worker placement board with new and better action spots and/or build spots in your park to hold visitors, then use your limited supply of workers to activate the abilities on your personal action board to help you make new dinosaurs by spending DNA or increase security to make sure the dinosaurs don't get out and eat your guests. If your threat level exceeds your security, then a few of the visitors that come to your park die, but in game terms this is only a -1VP penalty per eaten customer, so not a huge deal. The game varies itself by having three randomly drawn game modifying rule cards each game which is a nice idea. I love the components. The cute dino meeples that came with the deluxe are a delight. I will say the 80s tastic font they used in the rulebook was not a delight and was hard on my eyes to read.

Overall good, although the game has two problems. Problem one is that turn order is decided by who has the most VP. If you get a minor lead, then you wind up going last until someone overtakes you, and there's not much reason to do that when being first in turn order gets you first pick of all the new stuff that rolls or flips at the start of the turn. This can be controlled by building visitor spots that generate money instead of points, but this is still an akward, although not deal breaking mechanism. The deal breaking mechanism is how you get visitors. Once you are in the visitors phase, you draw meeples out of the bag equal to your parks "excitement level" which is driven by how many dinosaurs you have. The bag is full of some combination of paying customers worth VP, and non-paying meeples worth nothing. You've spent your turns and game so far making sure you get plenty of bag pulls and that you have enough room in your park to store all the guys you drew, and then maybe some large percentage of meeples you draw just don't produce for you at some random point in the game. Why? Who is this mechanism fun for? Is it to randomly hit someone doing well so that other players can catch up with their engine? If so, this pull luck can just as easily hit someone behind in VP. In our game we saw one card that mitigated the pull luck, and that was it. I looked at some of the other rules variation cards, and one adds a third color of meeple to the bag that are worth even more VP, so really just serving to ramp up this aspect of the otherwise fairly low luck game. If not for this mechanism I think this would have been a keeper for me. Really a pity because this game really had everything going for it.

Can't get past the ugly components. Plastic meeples... why??? It feels like they were just extremely rushed and didn't want to bother putting together something nicer. They really should have just went full-on plastic with dinosaur and worker miniatures or just kept everything wood.

This might be the heaviest box I have. Those metal coins are INSANE! I love having the deluxe edition. The variety of dinosaur meeples are so cool. I had so much fun with this Kickstarter campaign as we opened up more and more of a variety of dino meeples and other cool stuff. I have been eagerly awaiting this game and it was so hard to be patient. The game play was simply fantastic. There are a lot of components and a lot of things going on. It does make the setup and cleanup take a bit of time, but it's worth it. Also, the number of things going on doesn't make the game hard to follow. I found it all very easy to follow along with. It thematically all made sense. The board layout to take you through the phases makes it all simple. My engine was really working well by the end of the medium length game. I doubt I'll play anything less than the long game going forward though. First, it makes the setup/breakdown time more worth while. It also also will allow you to run that well build engine a few more times. I created a couple of velociraptors for my park and I was just beeming because of it! At the end it was more about how cool my park was than the number of points that I generated. Winning is just the icing on the cake.

Component wise - the coins are the star.  They were worth the extra $20 dollars.  All of the extra components to replace the regular version are appreciated as well.  Excellent production.  Some minor mistakes in the rulebook and in the first run of copies have some color misprinted of the visitor meeples which can be confusing without visual (youtube) aid.  The art theme may not be for some.  Gameplay wise - there is ALOT out on the table but the 5 phases break down makes it fairly streamlined.  It is hilarious to have visitor meeples being eaten. :)  In all, a very enjoyable and well produced medium euro game.

--Dec2017-- It's amusing. Though, naively, it seemed that the goals were far more significant than the rest of the game (in the "short" variant, at least; things might be different for a longer game.)  It might have done with a bit more development.

RATING: 7
I enjoyed it, but I'm not sure I'd want to play it 4 player again. The game took over three hours to play, and I was ready for the game to end after two. A few things I didn't care for are that if you don't get your engine going right away and someone else does, you can be at a great disadvantage for the rest of the game. They're likely going to sneak in the objectives at least a turn before you, have extra visitors and thus more money to do things than you next turn, etc. I guessed who was going to win after the first turn and he remained the clear player who was ahead the entire game.

Also, it seemed fiddly as far as you had a lot of bits to manipulate everywhere, things to retrieve, modify, keep track of, etc. It wasn't overwhelming but it got annoying and I found myself wanting more simpler mechanisms for what was mostly just a simple resource management "grab the resources you need and pay the right combination to build the thing" idea, hidden underneath about three layers of mechanisms.

The metal coins and the varied plastic dinos of the deluxe edition are properly ridiculously nice components, but I 'm glad I decided to pass on this Kickstarter. I don't doubt there will be plenty of people who will love the game, though.

Played 1 two-player game so far. Temporary rating until we have given it another try. 
The components for the deluxe edition are phenomenal, especially the large and chunky metal coins. 

Gameplay-wise, my fiancée and I may have played it wrong strategically as we kept gunning for the large carnivore and that made our coin supply relatively Low throughout the game as we were busy financing our security system to house our big ones. By doing so, we also denied ourselves a steady stream of VPs throughout the game.

What I feel about the game so far is that it is not as streamlined a worker placement game as snowdonia, village and energy empire which I adore. However, on the plus side, the theme does add on to the experience. 

Would try again

I really enjoy the theme and the overall flow of this game. I like how you move from board to board through the phases and how each phase is a chance to strategize for the worker place met phase. The after all that you sort of watch how a day in your park plays out.....was it profitable did people get eaten or did the hooligans eat all your profit?

Played a 3 player game with the KS deluxe edition. This is my first play. The coins are really nice and heavy. Not too impressed with the plastic dinosaurs. At the end of the day, these fancy components didn't add much to the game. I guess if you are excited about different types of dinosaur, you may care when you pick dinosaur and put it in your park.

The gameplay is okay at best. I feel the game is very repeptitive and basically you just keep snowballing your machine until the end of the game. The game is not really that exciting. The items in the market place don't make a whole lot of difference even you don't get what you want.  When the game ended, I didn't feel satisfied. Every round i am basically just doing the same thing and adding more points and money to what i earned last round. Since you are not going to have that many dinosaur recipe, you will keep trying to breed the same dinosaur, this part feels repetitive. 

All in all, it is okay. I will no longer pursue the kickstarter copy. I don't think it's worth the money. I will play it again with the right group. Hopefully I will have different option of it. I am slightly disappointed probably because i had such high hope of this. It just fell flat.

This game is great! Its a worker placement game with a theme I love that, while it looks intimidating, is incredibly easy to understand. My wife and I were super into this one. The decisions you make in each phase allow you to play as cut throat or as victory point conscious as you'd like to be. As a fan of Tycoon games, especially Dino Park Tycoon, as well as a fan of Dinosaurs and Jurassic Park, this game is a great addition to my collection, filling the gap of Worker Placement Id been missing. I will fault it for a couple places, however. The rulebook is flat out wrong in a couple places (for instance, it says the Customers are Gold and Yellow, but they arent, theyre Yellow and  Purple) and it does not go into any detail about iconography, so some stuff I felt I just "made a good assumption" about. Luckily theres a great video on Youtube that teaches you the game very easily in no time at all. The other issue I have with it is the inlay is awful haha. I had to look up how to fit it all in the box, and even then theres about 10 threads on BGG about it, and everyone seems to have their own interpretation of how to make it work, but none seem super graceful haha. These dont hurt the actual game itself by any means, just two things I noticed. The game is definitely solid enough to overlook these nitpicks (and maybe a Broken Token insert will fix that haha)

Jurrasic Park the game. :)

We've only played it a couple of times so far, and we've really enjoyed both plays. The rulebook seemed incomplete, as there are some symbols on the tiles and board that were not defined. If you've played Euros before, it's pretty clear what the symbols mean, but we had a couple of players who were a bit confused at first.

It's not a big deal however. I think the game is fairly easy to learn and is quite fun. The objective and plot twist cards add a nice variety to each play.

We played with 4 people and the first-game setup the manual recommends, and it ended way too quickly. It seemed like just when we got our engine going, the game was ending. We each only ended up with about 3-4 dinosaurs in our park... not very exciting.  I recommend playing with the medium game length objectives. Besides that, nice components, although the boards are insanely busy.

RATING: 10
This is an excellent worker placement game with a really well-done theme.  This is basically Jurassic Park: the board game.  In this game each player plays a company harvesting dinosaur DNA and filling their parks with dinosaurs to attract patrons and attempt to keep them from being eaten.

I love, first of all, that the game is so variable.  Each game many things are mixed up and changed to create a huge amount of variance from game to game.  This makes it intimately replayable, feel different each time it is played, and prevents players from "solving" it.  Each game uses different dice pulled from a pool, different goals which are the end game condition, and different lab upgrades, dinosaur recipes, and specialists are available each game.

There are a lot of systems here and it probably takes at least one game for even experienced gamers to really grasp it.  But all the systems work very smoothly together and don't feel jarring or disjointed.  This makes the very fun theme feel well integrated as you go from collecting DNA to upgrading your park and filling it with dinosaurs and payijng customers.

The game also looks awesome.  It depends on taste but there is kind of an 80s psychedelic color scheme with the neon green and pink everywhere.  I also, and I know this is a minor thing, love when player boards have indentations for things like cube tracking.  The tiles are thick as well, the dice are really high quality, and the pink dinosaur meeples are nice.  I could do without all the cardboard in it but that's a minor nit to pick.

First of all the components in the deluxe edition are excellent and unlike a lot of others I love the colors and artwork. As for the actual game it combines dice drafting and worker placement into a very enjoyable game. There is no direct player interaction other than taking something before they can get it but that is enough to ensure you end of watching everyone elses moves. The game has multiple objective types that alter the length of the game, we felt it was best with a longer length as with the short length you are only just getting into your own park

My rating (8) is based on the first play of the game.  I did not know what to expect from this game except that it was basically "Jurassic Park" the board game. I was pretty impressed at how there were so many "gears" in the game which all mesh together to make a very smooth flowing game that quickly ramps up into a very dangerous endeavour as you try to keep your visitors being a meal for the dinos!

The rulebook is a mess and the graphic design is a disaster! The deluxe components are over the top...in a bad way.

The gameplay is OK, nothing groundbreaking or particularly interesting. The only thing that keeps this game from being a 2 is that it has dinosaurs in it so I'll play it almost anytime anyone else suggests it...but I won't suggest it myself. 

The short game is useless. The medium game is a joke. The only way to feel like you've actually played this game is with the long game objectives.

I'm also significantly bothered that one of the designers has stated that letting people get eaten is a viable strategy. A HUGE thematic disconnect.

Very good game, a lot of great parts, but A LOOOOOT of parts.  Need to play it more for a better sense of exactly what I feel, but overall I think it's a more complex version of Brewcrafters.  It was multiple worker placement series (actually even adds a third even if it uses no actual workers), recipes/set collection and resource management.  I can't see myself playing it over Brewcrafters, to be honest.  The dice and threat level influence they have is very interesting, and I always felt like I needed one more worker, which is a sign of tough decision making that makes games great.  The theme certainly helps this game tremendously.

In Dinosaur Island, each player builds a Jurassic Park style theme park where you breed dinosaurs, build attractions, and the visitors have the potential to get eaten by the dinosaurs if you aren't careful.  I love the theme and it is perfectly interwoven with the mechanics.

The game play is satisfying with a combination of worker placement, set collection, and tableau building.  It's easy enough to teach that it could almost be considered a gateway game, but there is a lot of room for strategy.

One of my favorite aspects is the end game condition.  There are several public objectives (1 + number of players), and the game ends during the round that the 2nd to last objective is claimed.  This creates an interesting variable-but-foreseeable end game that felt tense.  Another great thing they did was create 3 different game lengths with the objectives.  By varying how difficult it is to claim the objectives, you can play either a 60, 90, or 120 minute version of the game.  This is such a simple and versatile mechanic that I hope to see in many other games.

My one complain is that the dinosaurs are all very generic.  There are 3 types - herbivore, small carnivore, and large carnivore - but within each type they are all basically the same.  I expect someday we will see an expansion that adds more variety.

Dinosaur Island provides some good times, but they're frustratingly cluttered and place the spotlight on three different worker placement micro-games rather than on the dinosaurs themselves. For all its variety, it focuses on the most rote aspects of running a dangerous zoo of prehistoric carnivores at the expense of the actual thrills that should have come parcel with such a great setting. Namely the, you know, prehistoric carnivores.

RATING: 5
The game is okay. On the forums some potential flaws have been pointed out, and they seem to be legitimate from my experience. Mainly that turn order is too important and there is a possible dominant strategy.

My own biggest issue is with the hooligans. They randomly punish players, and can end up costing you a lot of points. For example, there is a goal that gives you points for being the first to attract a certain number of patrons. Someone can beat you to the goal just because they happen to not pull any hooligans on a turn where you pull several. It's a needlessly random element in an otherwise not-very-random euro game. The randomness of the dice can also be a big factor in the game, but that doesn't bother me as much as the hooligans.

With that said, it's a fun enough game. You collect resources (DNA), buy dinosaur recipes, then spend your resources to make dinosaurs. Some of the phases are simultaneous so that helps to speed up parts of the game.

I just played this at a con and loved it.

The first thing you notice about this game is the color scheme. You can't help but noticed the color scheme. with the retro pink and green jumping out to almost blind you it really draws your eyes. I loved it. Everything was beautiful in this game.

The board was great too. One thing that I disliked with games like evolution is the cut cardboard game pieces I'd always do stupid crap with and have the piece fall through the board mid game. The back drop cut board really is nice. The dice are gigantic and fantastic looking.

The game play was really great. Worker placement games aren't always my favorite, especially when they last a while. The great part about this one is that during the second half everyone has their own board to place workers on and aren't competing. This means things happen faster so if you have that one indecisive player you aren't forced to glare off into space while you try to contemplate how you ended up in this bar and why you're surrounded by 3 middle aged guys instead of at home with a girlfriend.

All in all this is a game I would definitely play again. I really enjoyed feeding all of my park patrons to my dinosaurs.

KS Deluxe Edition: Beautiful to behold! At first... 
Various printing errors on boards/in rule book and Overproduced pieces - the coins for example - massive and heavy but the paint chips off just being in the bag and if you let them anywhere near any of the other components in the box you end up with damaged components. Give it 3 or 4 plays and it's not going to look so great...
Game play itself is fine - pretty standard worker placement. The dinosaurs (not the meeples) are a bit dissapointing - all pretty much the same.
The games biggest and worst flaw us how it stops - abruptly! Medium length games take 3 maybe 4 turns and then - boom - over! Theres no 'buy in'; it constantly feels that just as the game is warming up it just ends. The longer game didn't fare much better with one of our attempts lasting shorter than our average medium game.
It's not a bad game - it's just massively overhyped and ultimately very very dissapointing.

Good worker placement game. Certainly feels fiddly at first but smooths out after a round or two. I really dig the art and color scheme and the components are mostly good. I'd a much rather had wooden meeples over the plastic ones. Game play is easy to grasp after one round though the game does require some time to explain rules completely. Lots of small things to remember makes me wonder why there isn't a player aid provided. I enjoy the theme. I didn't care for the meeple draw mechanic from the bag with the negative meeples (I forget the name). It can really hinder the following turn if you pull too many from the bag. There are ways to mitigate them but still it felt out of place for a game that relies heavily on strategy. Game plays very fast, almost too fast even for the medium game. Overall I do enjoy it.

Got this through the kickstarter and it's been a great game for the whole family.  There is a lot of strategy involved, but it's still easy enough for the kids to pickup.    The game consists of a bunch of different but related phases where you can perform different actions all for the purpose of building dinosaurs/expanding your park.  With all the options the game stays fresh for a long time, and gives a lot of replay value since you can change up your strategy each time you play.  

So for example to build a dinosaur you might need 2 different "Advanced" dna and a few of the simple ones (there are 3 versions of each), 2 simple can be used to create 1 advanced in certain phases of the game so you have to plan accordingly to get the dna required to build the dino.  Some of these actions might require money (dna can be purchased), or it might require a worker which would be used in another phase.  So some planning through multiple turns can be required to complete a dinosaur, but simpler dinos might be able to be created in a single turn.

In addition to building dinosaurs you have to manage the "Threat" level that goes with the dinosaurs, so instead of just building all you can, you might have to take a break to up your security level to cover the dinos in your park.  This is done by purchasing security upgrades during on of the game phases, and depending on the workbench "tools" you have this can be at a reduced price, or you might even get bonuses to affect your current level.  Upping this level takes both money and a "worker" so you're limited as to how many upgrades you can make in a turn.

On the park building side you can manage attractions (bought for a price during one of the phases of the game).  The attractions will either net you points at the end of each round, or money depending on the type and whether or not you can bring in enough visitors.

We also liked the different play time options as even with the "short" version it takes us a while to complete a game and generally we spread the game out over a few days.  Highly recommended if you like strategy games (carcassonne, seven wonders, settlers of catan, etc.) and don't mind sitting down to play a game for a while.

Special translucent amber dice to determine available Dino-DNA to splice.  Personal storage and lab action boards to hire specialists for the park and increase DNA storage levels and cold storage embryo levels. Splice some meat-a-sauruses that raise the park excitement level increasing attendance.  Spare no expense.

We played our first game with "short game" objectives. Quite enjoyable. First off, the deluxe edition is ridiculous, with its insanely chunky coins, custom meeples, first-player wristband, etc.

The game itself is a four-phase worker placement and market game, where you're buying dino blueprints, attractions, lab upgrades and specialists to help you operate your theme park. As you gain more dinos, you need more security. Guests will arrive, and some can even be eaten.

The short game ended a bit quickly, but it was a good way to get to know the systems. Scores were super close, too.

No real complaints with how the game plays. Some players mentioned turn order being a bit hard to mitigate, but I don't find it any different than a lot of other Euros.

I think the plot twist and objective cards add tons of replayability, and even the "chaos theory" dice variant seems neat.

A winner.

** Second play with two players was competitive. The game still plays smoothly, and we felt the player order issues being discussed can totally be mitigated (which I did). Even with that, the player who went second most of the game still won. **

After a learning game filled with mistakes, I now understand what needs to be done to do better.  Complicated, odd, pretty good, so I would play again.  Hopefully making fewer mistakes!

I'm trying so hard to like this game, but that in itself is a huge problem. I shouldn't have to try. The theme is brilliant and I even find the colour scheme amusing, but the text, rule book, plastic meeples and general play of the game fall sorely flat. It's the first time that I am moving pieces around a bored with no real care for the outcome. 

I've put it on my 10 x 10 challenge for the year to see if I can come to appreciate it more, but my hopes aren't too high. Perhaps the plot twist cards will make it a bit more interesting. Haven't used them yet because I didn't want to overcomplicate the game to the new players.

A lot of familiar mechanisms bundled together in a very nice package. Nothing felt innovative but the game was still fun and interesting. I love the artwork and, being a dinosaur/Jurassic Park fan, the theme probably bumps the game up an extra point.

Another iteration of the GBOH system. I would bump my ratings for all the GBOH games up a point if GMT came out with a master rulebook instead of forcing me to read a densely-written rulebook every time they come out with a new title in the "series".

Probably the best of the GBOH series, this one cuts out a lot of the excessive chrome that burdened the earlier games and trims down the scenario size to something manageable (not to mention actually playable and, generally, interesting). Strategic game is a bit of wash.

GBOH does Byzantium (almost). Nice to have some rarer battles and some new units types (cataphracts), but the scenario choices are pretty uninspired (only Dara looks  balanced) and limited in number. The Byzantine Art of War is really poorly covered and this doesn't add enough. Missed opportunity

Next to SPQR this is the best of the GBoH game imo. There are fewer rules and less chrome here which leads to much quicker play. Almost like simple GBoH just better.

Belisarius is one of my favourite generals ever which is just icing on the cake.

Still unpunched, but hoping to remedy this sometime in the future. 

The included campaign game "Justinian" seems unnecessary and superfluous to me, I'd rather seen a couple of extra battles in the box. GMT haven't followed up on this (I suppose experimental) idea, so perhaps there are more than me that feel the same way about it?

Only played Justinian so far... excellent map and counters. Some of the rules are difficult to follow, and requires a few turns to catch on, but a very good simulation of an interesting period... Damn you, Persians!

RATING: N/A
Hmm...so many games from GBoH series, so little time, so little spare money to spend on one more game....not even to mention game modules. GBoH becomes more or less the ASL of the ancient period, albeit less figure-thumbing through the rulebook. This module records the lesser known Justinian campaign.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Compared to newer games, the rules seem a little strange but the scenarios are mostly good.  Dara is a very even contest.  If I have a problem with the game, it's that the Cataphracts are OP.  They effectively act as spear armed heavy infantry when dismounted.

This game deserves a reprint and an update.

A lot about the early Byzantine army, and about its opponents, remains controversial.

I think the Byzantine army of the early/mid sixth century, the focus of the game, resembled the Byzantine army of the late sixth century, described in the Strategikon, with the same distinction between cursores, or light cavalry, and defensores, or heavy cavalry.

Herman and Berg seem to think the Byzantine army of the early/mid sixth century was quite different from the Byzantine army of the late sixth century, and they rate all the regular Byzantine cavalry as heavy cavalry.

Also, it's hard to represent units combining lance-armed and bow-armed cavalry, and hard to get frontages right for both the infantry units and the cavalry units without allowing the infantry units to stack at least two high.

I don't want to give this a low rating. I would give this a much higher rating if I agreed with the designers' portrayal of the early Byzantine army. Of course. I would also give this a much higher rating if they addressed different views of the early Byzantine army, and maybe included alternate units.

I bought this actually for Justinian, but I ended up playing some Cataphract scenarios.  They are pretty good!

RATING: 7.5
This shows early Byzantine tactics. The game comes with game-specific GBOH rules but can use 'simple' GBOH rules instead. The absence of phalanxes, legions, and feigned retreats, or the fiddly rules for each of these, makes this the simplest and smoothest-playing game in the GBOH series.

The game includes five basic scenarios and one interesting (but confusing!) campaign game. I'll focus on the scenarios.

Dara: Byzantines vs. Persians. This tends to favor the Byzantines. This is the only big scenario.

Callinicum: Byzantines vs. Persians. This is well-balanced. Though a small scenario, it offers interesting tactical challenges for both sides.

Tricameron: Byzantines vs. Vandals. The designers enlarged the Byzantine Army (which gets one size point per 90 men; most get 1 size point per 100-150 men), and underrated the Vandal Army (mostly LN, and in this series HC will beat any LN they face). This is a blowout.

Taginae: Byzantines vs. Goths. The designers probably enlarged and overrated the Gothic army, but not by much. The historical scenario strongly favors the Byzantines, but free-deployment versions only slightly favor the Byzantines.

Casilinum: Byzantines vs. Franks. The Franks will die.

Homebrew Scenarios: The box includes the campaign game, ship counters, Viking counters (!), and Peleponessian War leader counters (!!). The box does not include any Vandal spear infantry, Gothic spear infantry, etc. and players will have to scavenge other GBOH modules for appropriate counters. Players can improvise Faventia with the included counters (and some new leaders) and can probably improvise Ad Decimum with some Caesar components (and some new leaders).

Fun if you really like small scenarios with lots of cavalry and arrows.  All 6 scenarios are ½ map, and most are about 25-50 counters per side – chump change compared to GBoH Alex or SPQR – and none last more than a couple hours.  Compound bow charts and "hit-and-run" cavalry rules were radically changed by the Attila module, but otherwise the rules are very easy and stripped-down GboH with little errata.  Very managable and playable solitaire, and great as an intro to GBoH for new players. 

As far as the Justinian game goes, I played it a few times solo and was not particularly impressed.  Long set-up time, only one scenario, lots of bookkeeping, and not much chance to win as the Byzantines.   I liked the strategic insight into a little-known era but I would have preferred more scenarios, either from this era or perhaps covering battles with barbarians from the 1st through 5th centuries AD.

I LOVE this game. Small battles with a lot of interesting troops and different tactical situations (unusually very balanced too!), great artwork as usual and a fine campaign game thrown in the mix (a magazine-quality game, but nice to play and treating a much neglected subject). A must own for the GBOH lovers.

Series Comment (Alexander, SPQR, Caesar TCW, Caesar CoG and Cataphract) 

The game graphics and components are good to great, depending on the publication date or edition. Excellent OoB and scenarii research! The scenarii are rarely balanced, but so were the historical battles…

The game has a lot of chrome and the Command system may make the game fun to play, but it cannot give an exact depiction of the actual battles. In fact, you really play in some kind of “parallel world” that has nothing to do with the actual battles and that’s a pity.

I globally agree with Markus Stumptner’s critique: http://patriot.net/~townsend/GBoH/gboh-critique.html

The Command system is really weird: For instance, when I played the Dara scenario, the Persians had to move their entire army to approach the Byzantine army protecting the city: It took quite a few turns and reflections to simply move the Persian army some ten hexes ahead! I really don’t believe the Persians were so bad that they couldn’t achieve a simple “move” and “stop” order to their army with a signal. What happened is that, as a player, I fought the system, before being able to “fight the battle”. It’s not very pleasant, iMHO.

(See replay here: http://patriot.net/~townsend/GBoH/Replays/Dara/summary.html)

I perfectly know that a game system that is both fun to play and accurately reflecting Ancient battles is quite difficult to design. This system had the potential, but fell short to achieving my expectations.

Note: I haven't played the campaign game (Justinian) included in the box.

Excellent.  Berg and Herman compliment themselves very well in this dual designed game.  The "clibanarius" were the MBT's of this time period.  The scenarios of Dara and Tagninae are my favorites.  Graphics are beautiful, as are the rules.  Even includes a naval battle (Sena Gallica) for War Galley.

Lots of manageable battles and a strategic game in the same package, very nice.  Better than the average GBoH from a balance standpoint.

Surprisingly lame GBOH game...watch Goths get run down by Cataphracted Cavalry with higher ratings, on 4 different plain battlefields.  It felt like filler for the Justinian Campaign Game, which may have been the case.

Dara is probably an 8 or 9;  the other battles are all 2s.

RATING: 4
GBOH for Byzantium, but the unbalanced nature of the battles means that Belisarius usually wins easily enough. The various barbarians were mostly charge straight ahead into the V of death type and suffered accordingly. Sold with its sister game Belisarius.

Not so much a volume in the GBoH series as five C3i modules/games in a box. Cataphract presents the player with the series' first super-unit in a small selection of battles in which they are not always certain to win, and then muddies the water with two games that require up to two other volumes of the series to play and a strategic level game.

Looks nice, but the usual suspects prevent me from trying this - paper boards, smallish counters, long-donkey booklet.

On the plus side, I like the unusual theme, 2-for-1 game bundle using same counters (Justinian). These kinds of games, in my opinion, need to have hard mounted boards and 1/72 plastic minis. (like Memoir 44 and Napoleon in Europe). I understand that with GMT's budget this won't happen though...

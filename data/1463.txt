Xxxenophile for the masses.  And that's a good thing.  Family-playable, almost Gateway-ish.  And it has Mimmoths.  Anything with Mimmoths gets bonus points.

RATING: 4
A cute fiddly little game. I would not recommend playing it with more than four players. Just way to erratic and random. Also be aware that this PC version of XXXenophile has some not-so-PC artwork on the cards. Can raise a few eyebrows from the ladies...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Makes me wish I'd played more XXXenophile, though as a TCG this would be nuts. It's a great game, though, easy to pick up and learn and heaps of fun. Extra fun for me, since I've read some of the Girl Genius comics and recognise some of the characters...

RATING: 4
Probably my least favorite of all the games I own.  It seems like it might be fun, and the game is good to look at, but in the end it feels like mindless activity (&quot;The game that plays you&quot;).  The others are right in that the downtime between turns is too long - it feels like a game that should be played against the clock.  A admirable idea &amp; execution that doesn&#039;t quite make it as a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An interesting mechanic, and a nice light puzzle game that's rather unique.  I wish the Girl Genius game were different and had more... zazz, I guess.  It was done rather early in the story, before you'd met most of the people.  There's not much of a theme in the style of play here.  It's a very nice puzzle game for two, and too chaotic with four.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
The other person moves change things so much that it is impossible to plan ahead. Way too long for a game that is almost purely random.

RATING: 5
Played twice (2-player and 4-player).

I'm thinking that this is a 2-player game. I'm also thinking that it's not going to get out that much, 'cause I usually 2-player with my wife.

Cute cards, neat concept, but to play well, you'd have to remember a lot about the deck composition. Not happening any time soon, buddy.

RATING: 5
One of the better Cheapass games, I think. Decent amount of strategy. The biggest problem is the playtime. It takes about half an hour. It would be a lot better if it were over in like 10-15 minutes. As it is, there are a lot of better games you can get in in that much time.

A fun and cute game by Cheap Ass Games.  For those of you who remember XXXenophile (also illustrated by Phil Foglio), the game will play very similar.  Granted XXXenophile was a little more enjoyable given the "risque" subject matter.
This game is brought with us any time we travel. Playing space is small so it works great for waiting at the airport or even on the plane.

RATING: 5
I love the comic.  I've loved the work of the artist/authors for years.  And yet, this game is really nothing more than a vehicle for that work for me.  You cannot build a theme into this mechanic; you might as well have Girl Genius: The Chess Set or Girl Genius: The Playing Cards.  The underlying abstract game is not bad, but there is no relationship to the theme.

Repeated plays has actually increased my liking of this game.  It's a lot of casual fun.  Yeah, it's not a "Gamer's game" (whatever that means), but it's a wonderfully crazy experience that only takes a few minutes to play. It is a bit mechanical and fiddly, but then it's quick and painless.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The rules are quite simple and the game is interesting and quick to play.

RATING: 6
Making chains of events is fun - but what comes out is kind of arbitrary, and random chance often hands players large advantages. Pattern-matching to look for pops is kind of fun, but if I'm going to really play a game for that, I'd rather it be [GAMEID=1198].

This game might be better with customizable-deck rules, a la [GAMEID=1627] - but might not.

(The [url=http://www.girlgeniusonline.com]webcomic[/url] the game is based on, however, is fantastic. That, I'll rate 9/10.)

I notice that a lot of people don't like this game, and I am honestly surprised. It is a very quick and fun pick-up game with a small physical aspect (flipping cards and rotating to match patterns), and is surprisingly fun for the time. I, admittedly, am also a Girl Genius fan, but I'd like this game even if not based on the comics,as any other theme could have worked as well for what I find to be a game different from most others I've played.

General Cannonhat... and His Amazing Cannon Hat.  Yeah, that&#039;s a card.  It feels odd, because frequently, you don&#039;t make moves for yourself, you force your opponent to make BAD moves.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I appreciate the use of adding a newish approach to using the cards in this type of game (turning them for matching effect), however; like many similar games I feel it is too chaotic to be a serious experience. The need to asses each card by reading its effect and looking over other cards sub text for triggers (etc. is this or that card a villan or soldier) is not easy to reference information and one would really need to play this game many times to remember the various cards. Something I would never have the interest to do.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I love the comic, but the game is just...lacking. It wants to be a strategy game, but any plans players try to make will be undone in a matter of turns.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A brilliant (IMO) game of clockwork-esque card placement. This scratches my itch for an abstract card laying game. Simple to learn, but very engaging the whole way through.

I've only played a two-player game, but could see this not being quite as good with more, as laying out traps or setting yourself up for a future move would be lost in the randomness of having more player's agendas on the board.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Cool Foglio art.  Ok game with 2 people, not as good with more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A simple mechanism for collecting cards from the table, with a light element of puzzle or choices. The game has a lot of characters with particular effects (a lot of small text too), but once you get the hang of the process, it gets quite interesting. I played as a 2pplayer game, and with more players it takes longer, but it's a fun game and I'd be happy to get a copy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Played 1 time. I was a little disappointed. The game concept is cool, but execution is so-so. I felt there wasn&#039;t enough chain reactions, and the actions on popped cards just seems to make the game arduous as you check to see what all needs to change. I tried to make some clever plays to force my opponent to take bad cards, but there&#039;s almost always something else she could do to avoid my card, which meant there felt like very little interaction, and even less strategy. Disappointing. Sort of a cross between a German game and an american card game, but missed the mark of a quality game.

A typical James Ernest offering; a nice idea which was not completely developped to transform it into a real game.  The flipping&turning is interesting but not sufficiently engaging to be brought out too often.

I love Phil Foglio, I love Girl Genius, but I don't care for the puzzle element here quite so much.  Given the choice between this and XXXenophile, I'd rather play the latter...though perhaps that's not quite as good a selection to bring to my local Game Night.

I got this because my wife and I are HUGE fans of the Girl Genius comic.  (Seriously, go read it online now.)  But the game, despite its claim of ~30 min playtime, takes us HOURS.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun little strategy card game with unique spin-and-pop mechanics. What I like most about this is that the "board" is created from the cards themselves (something that Barons would use to greater effect years later). Too luck-based for my taste and play too long for what it offers though.

The game-mechanic of laying down cards and turning them around is something between ingenious and terribly chaotic. Playing this game can be a wonderful experience of out-thinking your opponent, but also a tedious run of randomly drawing just the right cards.

RATING: 7
My brother and I really like the puzzle of it all.  It's one of his favorites now.  I've also enjoyed a few games solitaire to see how quickly I can win, but it's obviously [i]much[/i] easier when you can set up chain reactions for yourself.  The game has also piqued some interest in the Foglios' comic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Better than I expected, more a card based puzzle than a card game in most ways. Certainly amenable to many levels of scheming.

RATING: 7
I admit, I got this game because I am a fanboy of the Girl Genius webcomic. But this is a nice little filler or family game. My daughter (age 7) picked it up very easy. I don't think this has the chops to be a classic, but it will be fun once in a while. The non-gamer wife is a demon at it.

RATING: 6
An update to xXxenophile that removes collectibility and the R-rated material (though only down as far as PG).

While getting rid of randomized booster packs is always a good idea, I'm not convinced taking this all the way from CCG to standard card game (rather than to LCG) was a good idea. Without the ability to design a deck, a lot of what made the original game interesting is lost.

The game is neither strategic nor fun.
In addition, this game's illustrations are not as kid-friendly as I had hoped they would be.  Don't get it to play with your daughter if you don't want to explain lots of busty characters.

RATING: 7
Simple mechanic, but strategy required...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

For those of us who remember XXXenophile fondly, the mechanic lives in another Foglio theme product. Not a deep game, and poor play has the potential to hand a game away in a hurry, but a thoroughly enjoyable game.

James Ernest can design good or bad games, but all of them are very original. The Works has very original mechanics, and is worth giving it a try. Too analytical sometimes and too random other times. You need to discover a good movement that can pop many cards from the board. Your perception, analysis and combo-discovering is more important than your strategy.

I don't like the theme, although graphic art is good.If you don't follow the webcomic you won't understand the meaning of any special effects.

RATING: 5.5
Ideal Players: 2-4

Description: Rotate cards in a grid to match up symbols and "pop" cards. When cards pop, their abilities activate and they go to your score pile.

Pro: Unique game mechanic. Fantastic art and interaction between cards. Interesting planning involved in preventing other players from popping good cards.

Con: Many tags on cards aren't referenced by other cards. Theme gets old after a few games. Card interactions aren't as interesting as I want them to be. Needs expansions to add variety (maybe the ability to customize decks?). Needs special cards that aren't played into the matrix to add interesting choices.

Intersting mechanic, but this one definitely has a learning curve. First few plays will be longer than they normally should because the players will be learning what all the cards do, and how they interact. I can see this one being a nice filler game once the player's all have a familiarity with it, but the problem is whether, or not, the player's would be willing to invest the amount of time to get to that point. In my case, maybe.

I think this game is way underrated. Maybe not a 9.5 for everyone, but it's one of our most frequently played games due to its portability and replay-ability. With more than two players it's meh, but with two players it's so much fun to set up complex chain reactions and traps for your opponent. I keep this in my purse at all times, and we like to make coffee shop dates just to play this since it travels so well. Plays best with two - and with a partner who will allow you a little extra time to create all kinds of intricate chains of cause and effect.

Can be quite a brain-burner; however a contest between several seasonned player will make it very difficult of any of them to obtain an advantage, the result being that the score will be similar for most (all) of the game. Is more enjoyable when playing for 50 (gets kinda repetitive going for 100)

A neat little "spot that" kind of game. You can't do a lot to strategize (by which I mean set up a future score), but it's rewarding when you find a good play.

2+ players.  This game is pretty fun.  I've only played it a handful of times, and it is always difficult for me to get people to play new games.  I could see it causing analysis paralysis if people took the game too seriously.  I'd like to play with more than two players some time.

I have only played it once; it seemed okay, but pretty limited in a way. It seemed like you needed a few plays to really learn the 'system' that was going on, but I suspect once you've learnt the system there's not much reason to continue playing.

Update: played a couple more times; have no real desire to play it again. The gameplay seems to be designed around stifling your opponents moves, so that they can only make plays that will benefit you. This game lock-down pretty much sucks the life out of what looks like it should be a fun little filler game.

This one really surprised me! A few minutes into it I was convinced that this was another in a long line of dopey themed card games that play you rather than you playing it. Yes, it's pretty chaotic and you're limited by the cards you get, but there is a modicum of control and the flip-and-pop mechanism is actually pretty cool. Will I ever request it? No, but if someone suggests it I'll gladly play. Coming from me, that's as close as you'll get to a rave when it comes to this style of game.

I don't know how much of a game this really is.  Sure, there are decisions, but a lot of what happens goes down because it's kinda programmed into the system.  It's not exactly as though you're playing your opponent(s) as much as you are playing multiplayer solitaire against the system.

Although the game rules support more than two players, the strategy seems to only be satisfying when exactly two sides are involved. Recommend playing with two players, or two teams of players, only - unless using alternate multiplayer rules.

RATING: 6
Mostly luck, and a little strategy, but not much meat.  I tend to prefer games with constant choices.  Often in Girl Genius, you  have only one choice of action on a turn, or you might even not be able to do anything.  Still it's fun fluff on occasion. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
There's kind of the illusion of strategy in this, but in reality it's pretty difficult to exert much influence over anything but your immediate move, which usually boils down to "what will get me the most points?"  If someone's not very familiar with the cards, there's also a lot of downtime inbetween turns where card actions are read and digested.  Still, there's a great sense of whimsy and fun in the game, and I do enjoy watching the Mimmoths stampede around from player to player.

I enjoy this game but not many other people I play with do. I think it's the fact that it is quite a random style game. Seems to be a lot of to-and-fro and overthinking of moves. Not a BAD game, just... different...

A Cheapass game with nice components and packaging and I still don&#039;t like it!  I guess they just can&#039;t please me, although I still do admire their philosophy.  The opposite of a good game:  a virtually random game that requires far too much thought and analysis.

I like this very quirky little game.  Total chance when flipping those cards over as to what will pop so if you can't stand random games stay far, far away.  If you dig it then really check this one out as it's quite a lot of fun.

Very enjoyable game.

The fact that you use a small proportion of the cards, to create the board, before somebody wins, makes this game more enjoyable and most likely longer lasting.

What if everything in the world was a cog in a giant machine? That's the idea behind Girl Genius: The Works, a new strategy card game from James Ernest Games.
\13\\13\
The Works is a puzzle game featuring artwork from the new Phil Foglio comic series, Girl Genius, available from studiofoglio.com. In the game, players are manipulating a board made of 12 cards, flipping and spinning the cards and trying to make them pop out of the machine. When a card pops, it has a special effect, and then it goes into your score pile. The first player to collect 100 points wins.
\13\\13\
The Works has an ingenious and simple set of rules, and it's a blast to play. You can play with only two players, or as many as 6. The game is self-contained, with nothing more to buy and no extra parts to use. It even comes with four "lost turn" cards to help you remember when you've been forced to lose a turn.

It's a bit of a puzzle-solving game.  The gameplay is fun and original, but it suffers from the "how badly can I screw myself" syndrome -- at some point, you'll have to make a bad move because there are no good moves left, and often this will swing the balance of the game.

It seems as though there's not a whole lot of strategy here, as the board is mostly hidden from the start.  So if you get lucky, you can score some cards.  Maybe that's the progression that's supposed to be in place: becoming more strategic as the game progresses (since you have control over what card(s) are played and how they're played).  Would like to play more to see if the game has staying power.

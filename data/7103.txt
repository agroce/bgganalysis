A wonderful game that really gives the flavor of a dogfight. I've had this since the early 80's and have yet to even read the Intermediate and Advanced rules! I'm easily sated, I guess. I used to drive my friend Bob insane by continually guessing right where he'd be.

Least favourite of the series but still a fast fun and challenging game.  Can be played anywhere, with almost anyone.  A good game to travel with or to introduce non-gamers.

As with all the Ace of Aces games a graphics update would make this game perfect.

The paper cover edition is derided by Ace of Aces fans, and deservedly so: the components are cheap and easily damaged or lost. Gameplay is still the same though.

This is a terrific biplane combat game that can be taken with you anywhere you go.  These were earlier planes than the first set and were harder to fly.

Not nearly as much fun as the Handy-Rotary series nor the Power House series. However, good to have if you are an afficianado/completist of this system.

This version features the British Airco with swivel-guns (allowing a forward 90 degree field of fire!). This makes for a very challenging game for the German monoplane!

Played a very basic game.  Mechanic is neat.  A bit confusing.

RATING: 8
I never found the curious front gun to be a "problem" - it inflicts a reduced amount of damage which is certainly "realistic".  My problem was the fact that the DH/2 was never really operational with a flexible gun; in practice, the flexible gun was found to be impractical so the gun was fixed.  However, planes from the same era as the DH/2, i.e. Vickers Gunbus, Fe2b, etc. used a flexible forward gun since they had a gunner along for the ride.

The DH/2 - Fokker E. III match up was a bit odd - in reality, the DH/2 could fly circles around the Fokker despite the former being aerodynamically unsound due to its pusher design.  The Fokker's brief period of ascendancy was due to the fact that it was one of the first planes to mount a forward firing gun rather than the make-shift mountings for machine guns and rifles and other weapons which had been used up until that time.  Once other (better) planes that were similarly armed began to make their presence felt, the Fokker fell by the wayside.

Ace of Aces is an excellent two player game, even in the basic edition. Doesn't take much space, is easy to teach, and plays well. Alas, it is long, long out of print. The initial three books were the best.

Hard to tell what direction you are flying, unlike original rotory series aircraft

RATING: 7
Always fun.  Excellent graphics and theme integration.  Can be improved by the addition of a small amount of color on gun flashes.  Easily portable, short playing time, easy to store mid game: perfect for play at school between classes or during your lunch break at work.

RATING: 6
More of the same, but it seems these flying machines maneuver more poorly when compared to the Handy Rotary and Powerhouse Series planes. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
An interesting mechanism, if a little clumsy. But fundamental flawed by wonky flight mechanics. Apparently, whatever move I make, my opponent ends up behind me. If I make a long sweep to the left, and he strafes to the right, he's still behind me. Increasing frustration with the way the books interpret manoeuvres put a real dampener on what should have been quick fun. I could see this being revived with better graphics and selling nicely.

The Ace of Aces games are classics.  All of them offer a unique system that allowed you to get a first person perspective to combat and were still remarkably playable.

RATING: 10
HOW DO IT KNOW !!!  I love this mechanism.  I am playing it again after many years and an extensive search.  Print out some recording sheets, people will begin to memorize the moves and the first to call out his move will get smoked.  I find that the Allied Pusher is very difficult to defeat.

We used to sneak off at lunch to the balcony over the swimming pool to play this game in high school. Great travel game, but not something you could build a serious game night around.

Some of the first "new style games" I played. These are original games that I purchased at a game store in Albuquerque called Wargames West. I have never played the advanced rules and only play 1 v 1. My kids really like this game and my goal is to play with more people.

RATING: 7
Confused by the pusher.  I haven't been able to sit down and look through the books yet to compare, but because of the 'flexible' forward gun on one of the plans, does that mean it has more 'firing pages?'

Because of this though, I had trouble understanding where I needed to be to stay out of it's guns.

Would be interesting to mix these in.

RATING: 5
Played a few times- fun, espeically since planes are different enough in design that tactics have to differ based on Allies/Axis

An add on to the Ace of Aces system which I played once or twice with a friend. Since it added nothing new to the system except a pair of less maneuverable planes and since I already owned the handy Rotary series, I never bought this and have no interest in acquiring same.

When I first started work, this was compulsory coffee break entertainment. Now that no-one does coffee breaks, it's gathering dust!  
_____________________________
Update Oct 2010: played for the first time in 20 years and was amazed by how fresh it felt. This truly was one original system. 

While the basic game (and I've rarely felt the compulsion to go with more clutter) in some ways boils down to scissors/paper/stone, for a light 15 minute 2 player game there aren't many I'd choose ahead of it.

If you fancy this on a board I recommend GDW's 'Blue Max'.

Played this one after playing the succeding editions.  I was impressed with the dramatic advances in technology from 1914 to 1918.  My hat is off to the flier that can effectively employ one of those pushers.  I think I went 0-11 in an DH-2.  Had a blast, though!

Can be played anywhere.  I always am getting the &*&^*%^ blasted out of me, though.  But, I always take the British plane- maybe that's the problem?  Anyone ever play the multi-player version?

That pusher plane is fun to play, particularly if you can stay slightly askew and chip away at your opponent.   I still like the Rotary series best, but that is maybe because I have the most time in it.

elegant design...using two books.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Finally played my copy of Flying Machines and regretted it.  It seemed unbalanced in that the Allied plane could shoot at multiple angles while the German plane had fixed guns.  I'll stick with Handy Rotary or Powerhouse from now on.
Tried playing with the Handy Rotary edition but the books were incompatible.  Very strange as I thought that all of the WWI books could be mixed and matched.  Sad.
***
Another thought: The fact that this game is rated at 7.something just goes to show that a lot of people who have played this game have never played the Handy Rotary edition. Yes, the system is cool - but this version just plain sucks.

SEQUEL TO WWI AVIATION CLASSIC 
I owned and was a huge fan of the Handy Rotary Series - I just HAD to get the new "Flying Machines" version.  The manoeverability of these early war flying machines is severely limited and therefore a lot less entertaining to play than the Rotary Series.  I might have played a dozen times for the novelty, but once that wore off went back to the Handy Rotary or Powerhouse books for a good time.  The only reasons to track this one down and purchase it are (1) you are an Ace of Aces completist or (2) you are a real WWI aviation buff.

RATING: 7
Not quite as good as the Handy Rotary series; still screaming good fun.

The problem with this one is the enhanced arc of fire on the Allied plane.  That makes it tough for the Germans to keep up.

But Ace of Aces is a very rewarding game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Classic WW1 air combat game.  I particularly like this set for playing the basic game, as there are fewer manuevers making it harder to set up your opponent.  Also the swivel gun on the allied plane adds a new element not found in other games of the series.

Each player has a book.  Each page shows a view from their airplane with a list of maneuvers along the bottom.  Pick a maneuver and tell your opponent what page they go to and they do the same.  The epitome of the first person shooter before the world ever heard the word 'Wofenstein 3-D'

RATING: 10
One of the most original games ever!  Simultaneous movement and combat, fog of war, all in a couple of sturdy softback books you could tote around with you anywhere.  Out of print, but well worth chasing until you get it.  

This set can be used with either the Rotary or Powerhouse editions to handicap a better player, as these represent older, less powerful planes.

Back in the day we played this until the books fell apart. Asymmetrical -- it's easier to hit your opponent as the British pilot (his gun is on a swivel) but you do more damage as the German.

I'll have to Ebay a new(-ish) copy one day.

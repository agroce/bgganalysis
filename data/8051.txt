This game suffers from all sorts of flaws and it isn't even pretty. But I love it. Being unfamiliar with the tiles works against new players and it is difficult to keep track of what is and is not required to keep building your territory. Still, there is a lot of win here, especially if you pay attention. High player counts help.

Sucks with four players (way too much downtime, dragging endgame) but absolutely shines with two. Perfect level of complexity and fun to boot!

Excellent original game which rewards strategy but has an element of luck/randomness thrown in to require good tactical play as well.

RATING: 6
Started off really liking this game for two but don't seem to want to play it much anymore. Normally it's impossible to connect temples and so it becomes a race to get all your tiles down. But rather a dull race, I now find

RATING: 5
Wasn't crazy about it.  My perspective was that the luck of tile draw really made a huge difference how fast you could jump out with building, based on the discounts/free buildings.  also, I found the interactons to be very boring.  Edit: played it again and really didn't like it.  I seem to hate it more each time I play it.

RATING: 7
A combination of alot of familiar ideas from other games (modular board, card drafting, route planning) that comes together into a very scalable, accessible game.

The goal is to either be the first to build all of your buildings, or to connect two temples to each other with your buildings.  This leads to alot of tactical blocking, and the occasional surprise quick-ending.

To build, you need to first get your buildings onto your personal board, and then you have to get them onto the main board, plus you need to meet the resource cost of each building.  To get resources, you can either use the resources on the board, or grab resource cards.  There is also the opportunity to gain extra actions if you build carefully.

This is a good game to introduce to beginners, or your wife, as it incorporates alot of familiar concepts, plays very well as a 2 or 4 player (but not so well as a 3er), and has a light feel to it.  Rates about an 8.5 for me as a 2-player.

120908 A few plays of this game and I'm really digging it.  Its not worth paying high OOP prices, but is a fun little tile placement/connection game.  I agree with the critiques that the endgame killer might not be perfect yet, but it definitely gives the game its thrill.

RATING: 7.2
A fun game where you build little circles (buildings) on a map of hexes and fight over space and resources with your neighbors. The ancient-civilization-building theme is cool, but the theme kind of fails once you get much into the game; the different nations and buildings have no flavor. There is a good bit of conflict with other players over resources and the shrine thingies. Kind of feels like a mix of Hex and Settlers a bit.

RATING: 5.5
It feels like a throwback German token game. It has been said this game is not good at all with 3 or 4, but plays quite well with 2. I wouldn't know - but could imagine this being so. The game is a measure of luck and then a run for victory as you collect card sets (very Euro) and place 'buildings'. The problem is there are two ways to win - and connecting is the easier of the two, unless someone cuts you off (which is also very easy). Then it is a war of attrition. So all in all, not something I need to own and am not anxious to play again.

Juego muy entretenido, con bastante azar que le da ser más táctico que estratégico, un euro ligero muy bien diseñado y emocionante hasta el final, con enormes opciones y decisiones al jugar. Ideal para 2 jugadores, se puede jugar hasta 4 sin problema. Materiales correctos y muy claros, si bien es mejor añadirle una gemas para marcar los edificios ya construidos. Un clásico imprescindible, descatalogado, muy difícil de conseguir, nueva edición ya! jeje

RATING: 7
In this game there is the winner while all the rest are losers. This changes the table dynamics, since it is in everyone's interests to target the perceived leader. I kind of like it. There are enough games in which you collect points. In Attika you play to win. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Somewhat undervalued game from a good designer. Filled with interesting decision. One minor drawback: a new map-tile almost help more to the others, as you are able to put maximum one building on it on your turn.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Reasonable but not as good as I was hoping.  It has overtones of Settlers, Durch de Wuste and even Ticket to Ride (making long links and drawing cards as an option - and playing 2 cards if you haven't got the right one is a bit like drawing a loco).  It's low on inter-action though, and you sometimes have to be the one to block to stop someone connecting the temples to gain a win, yet the cost of doing that is often large in terms of where it leaves you.  I found it a high-mediumish brain-burner, but with less fun attached than other such games.  I also found it a bit dry and even arid at times.  Not a bad game, and I much prefer it to Settlers, but it's not as good as the other games I mentioned here.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Have only played 3 and 4 player. 4 player seems a bit split with less interaction and is almost 4, 3 player games occuring simultaneously. 3 player is interesting but can often lead to a situation where one player is left to stop the others winning. Rarely see people win by connecting cities.

This /is/ the second coming of Settlers.  "Second coming" means that it is better than the first!  Seriosuly, this game has all the strengths of Settlers (except for the trading, but it has got everything else), and doesn't have many of its weaknesses (such as dice luck and rich-gets-richer problem).  It has got the simplicity and fast pace of play which La Citta lacks.  The theme is even better than Settlers, with many different types of buildings with different characteristics without the introduction of dozens of exception rules.  Playability-wise, there are more flexibility and more real options during play, while there is also a suitable amount of luck.

RATING: 7
Great game.  Lots of player interaction.  Some randomness in tile layout, chit order and cards, but not so much that it's a big problem - it's manageable.

I've heard it's best with 2 players, though 3 players isn't horrible.  4 players is right out (or so I am told).  Looks like it may be true.  Really shines as a 2 player game.

A fun game.  I recommend giving it a play.

RATING: 8
Gives an understanding of fighting for and creating your territory (which is quite a feat for an Go-incapable person). Needs constant balancing of goals and switching between offense and defense. Hand managment is critical. Works well with any number of players, as long as all play optimally/fairly. Quite a lot player interaction. There is the luck of the draw, but the "luck" emerging from a good placement/preparation is more important.
CG artwork, a little bit "plastic".
Needs a nice set of glass beads for buildings built.
Too little island tiles for a 4P game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The first few times I played this, it didn't seem to spectacular, but then we all figured out the actual strategy of filling up your player board so that you can build for free. Then it was pretty fun. The replay didn't last long though, and we haven't played it in about a year.

RATING: 7.5
I've just recently come into possession of Attika through an auction at a local game store and I feel sorry that I did not own this game earlier. What a wonderful mix of resource/hand management, clever tile placement, luck, strategy, and speedy play. The game is great two player and I have barely begun to grasp some of the strategies that make for a highly competitive game. All of our games have been won by connection so far, but it has become harder and harder each time. I expect that after we become seasoned players, the "play all your buildings" condition will be more often than not the deciding factor.

Still, I love the theme, love the components, love the speedy play. I've played some multi-player, and I cannot attest to the "kingmaking" problem that many see on this site. Although most of the multi-player I have played has been with newer gamers anyway, so I'm sure they wouldn't notice it at all. It's a great game, I'll be playing it for a long time.

The more I play this one, the more I like it.  There's a good amount of tension, and it seems to play well with 2-4 players.  The rules aren't too tough to explain, either.  We recommend using small glass stones to mark on the player mats which buildings have been built by that player.

If only there was a way to mark the spaces in your city that are in use on the board, it would be even better.  I use pieces from another game for that...

RATING: 8
Fun two player games around.  The draw of the tiles may seem to add too much luck but a good player can compensate for this. 3-player is good only if the players are of equal skill.  I would not recommend 4 as it adds too much randomness and downtime.

Attika is a distant cousin of abstract connection games like Twixt and Hex.  One way to win is simply to connect two temples with your pieces.  

To this it adds some most un-abstract mechanics.  Every piece is a building that needs a different combination and number of resources to be placed.  You are drawing buildings in a random order from face-down stacks and drawing resource cards from a face-down pile.  A neat concept is families of buildings, which are built for free if placed in the right order.  Also clever is the expanding playing area; suddenly, that flank you had sealed off is wide open.

So, Attika is a neo-abstract with a simple set of rules and a short playing time.  There's certainly some randomness, but it also presents some tough decisions around timing (what to build now and what to keep in reserve), risk (can Bob really build three next turn and can I leave it to Carol to stop him?) and resource management.  Attika has been a grower for me; it took a while to appreciate its subtle virtues.

In keeping with the game itself, Attika's artwork is simple and almost abstract.  Production quality is fine.  I've had no issues with the rules.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
When new tiles are places, holes can arise and this is rather unelegant and annoying. Especially when you want to connect temples. I wish besides the groups in which the buildings belong were more clearly identified. Anyway it is just another abstract game with a theme pasted on.

I really enjoy this one and play it primarily as a two player.  Simple game play with pretty deep strategies to explore I find this one engaging for such a quick player.  With the modular board I'm sure that the replayability will remain high on this one for me.  Update, I've changed this to a 9 based on the two player game alone.  This is a fantastic game at two and I'm always willing to play.

Played once with 4. OK game, although it took a lot longer to play than it says on the tin.

Attika is a pretty good game. The only thing I hold against it is that the strategy is a little bland. A lot depends on the luck of how your stacks end up sorted at the beginning of the game. There also isn't enough player-player interaction other than tile placement. It's basically a race to see who can build tiles most efficiently.

A little lighter than I was expecting it to be but none the less a great game. There isn't much strategy besides blocking your opponent and getting amphoras.

RATING: 6.5
{1 play • 3 player} Probably the highest rating [6.5] it'll get from me... and it'll likely go down with future play.  The decisions are okay, but it's really more of a race than anything else.  It was fun to concentrate on *my* plan, but I had no interest in seeing what resourses my opponents needed to build stuff (mostly 'cause it's too hard to see), so, really, all you do tacticly is block stuff, placement-wise.  Or, in the case of our game, you don't see that I can place three streets and connect... which I did... quite unsatisfying win.  Eh.  The '10' people are nuts. {after 4 more plays} As predicted, my rating has dropped.  Oddly enough, the midgame is more interesting to me now that I'm familiar with the game, but the endings have become even worse - even when I've won, it's been unsatisfying.  You need the connection victory condition for the tension it creates (otherwise there's *really* no game), but the connection win is always anticlimactic, basically because it never seems earned.  I'd be very surprised if the fans of this game were still playing a lot of it a year or two from now. [after a 2-player game] I've bumped my rating back up because it works really well as a 2-player, perhaps the only I'll play from now on.

A bright little game that can be very enthralling. I guess I'll have to wait to play it on a physical board to give it a higher rating, though. BSW is fun, but I like boardgames better in person...

UPDATE: After several more plays, I believe it's too chaotic to desrve it's 8 rating; dropped to a 7.

I've played it more now, and I really like this game.  The game is not as luck driven as most would have you believe.  It is like a cross between go (actually twixt or hex would be more appropriate) and the building/resource side of settlers.

The game is quite delightful, and I have no qualms with highly recommending it.

I gave this a few tries with my wife and some buddies in my group.  Each time I played it I just didn't feel satisfied.  I didn't see any clear strategies, and it just didn't feel like the design and game play was thoroughly thought through enough for my taste. Even though it has a relatively short game time, I'm just not motivated to bring it to the table any more.

Szép játék! A menete is tetszik, mondjuk kedvenc nem lesz, de nem bánom, hogy kipróbáltam. 30 épületünket elsőként kell lehelyezni településekké formálva azokat. Számít, hogy mi mivel szomszédos, és a területen lévő nyersanyag adottságok is fontosak az építkezésnél. Elég egyszerűek a mechanizmusok, a szabály kb. 5 percben elmondható.
Talán túl nagy előny illeti a kezdőt, annak ellenére, hogy a szabály igyekszik kompenzálni.

Másfél év után újra előkerült. Nem véletlen mondják sokan, hogy 1 parti alapján nem szabad ítélni. Bár alapból se volt rossz véleményem róla, de most többet is játszottunk, és kifejezetten jó játéknak tűnik! Máris javítottam 1 pontot az értékelésén, de ez akár még feljebb is mehet.
Először is egy átlagos 2 fős parti 20 perc, nagyon pörgős! Ennek ellenére egész komoly dilemmákat nyújt, mondhatni komoly játék, ez így együtt nagyon ritkaság! Emellett a kétféle győzelmi lehetőség nagyon jó csavar, és nagyon kevés akciófajtával sikerült változatossá és izgalmassá tenni a játékot. Szerencse szerepe nem kicsi, de számomra tolerálhatóan adja ezt el a játék. Annyira tetszett, hogy egymás után 5-öt játszottunk, 2 órán belül lement az összes parti...

Tovább javult a pontszám, nagyon élvezetes, és sokszor újrajátszhatónak tűnik...

Hárman is kipróbáltuk: katasztrófa! Ennyire királycsináló játékot még nem láttam. Simán lehet olyan helyzet, hogy a harmadik játékos egyszerűen eldönti, hogy ki nyerje meg a kör végén a játékot. CSAKIS KETTESBEN szabad játszani!! Bár a négyest még nem próbáltam, de annyira nem is vágyom rá ezek után:)

Nice gateway game.  I prefer playing with the unofficial 3 amphoras rule for connecting the shrines.  It still motivates players to connect the shrines but doesn't force people to make self destructive moves.  It prevents new players also from feeling bad that they let everyone down and let someone win.  Even if players didn't block or forgot to do so, the game isn't over and all the players can move on.  
UPDATE (9-30-06):  7 -> 8

9-17-07
Played the game a few more times and the rough edges are showing themselves.  It has considerable downtime.  For two players it isn't bad as you only have to wait for one player, but it can be significant with more players.  Since on a players turn they don't really know what they'll get because the buildings they get is random, you have nothing to do when it is not your turn.  I guess it allows players to talk about other things while they wait for their turn which could be a good thing.  However, we are here to play the game and we should be playing the game.
UPDATE: 8 -> 7

Oct 25, 2007
The game has sat in my shelf for quite a long time.  I have no desire whatsoever to play it.  Due to luck of the draws one can't really plan ahead so the downtime goes way up as more players come into play.  I find the "connect two temple" victory condition to be "broken" as it almost always places a player in a position to block the person about to win but shoots himself in the foot at the same time.  Thus I don't want to play this game with more than 2 players if not using the 3 amphora variant.  In 2-player games the "connect two temple" victory condition works very well.  However, as a 2 player game it is not that exciting.  I would actually say boring and frustrating.  You can't really plan ahead since you don't know what you are pulling off of the tiles.  This is a mediocre game and you can pass this game without missing anything.

I bought this as a 2-player game, after having found this is Attika's sweet spot. This is the second Casasola-Merkle's game I played, and I must say this designer rocks! Its games are clever, innovative, very spatial, and tremendously fun! Sometimes in multiplayer games the winner could be determined by some player's bad move, so it is more enjoyable and tactic with just 2 players (7.5) than with more (6.5).

Out of Print (OOP).

Had another play recently and I think this is a good game for 3 or 4 players. While is can be played with 2, the game would seemed quite silo with each player focusing more on building of their own city. Then there is virtually no way mostly to connect the shrines from one point to the next unless a mistake is made.

However upon having another player it gets more interesting since there are more options as to whether where will be a good point to connect to. Even though I was focusing on getting the 30 buildings on the board, the game was won by a player who connected from one point to another. We couldn't block her from winning. Got a better feel of the game now.

Played once as a 4-player game with the rules explained to me.  I guess I should elaborate on why this game did not win me over.  For starters, in a 4-player game, someone needs to sacrifice their own position in order to be the blocker of a game winning connection.  Second, I dislike the 4 draw stacks.  Athens was on the very bottom of my black draw stack.  As expected, this makes it really difficult to play efficiently, so a lot of my tiles were placed on my player mat instead of on the board.  Third, I dislike drawing cards.  One player never drew a Forrest card, which limited his ability to play buildings.  Finally, I hate the placement of new board tiles.  You cannot build more than 1 building on the new board tile, unless you have an extra action, but then you still have to draw a building randomly from the draw stacks instead of using a building from your player mat.  Perhaps this game is better with fewer players.

This game is very good.  I enjoy the hand management aspect as much as the building and planning parts of the game.  I like the fact that game game is based a bit on luck as well, in drawing tiles.

A pretty game with a city building theme where the objective is to construct all your buildings or stretch your city from one end of the terrain to the other. Visually I find it one of the most attractive games I have. The rules are fairly simple, strategy is robust but not cutthroat, plays faily quick in about 1 hour. I like it better than Carcassonne, a good family game.

[i]Posted: 4/21/06, Rated: 8[/i]
{2P:9, 3P:8, 4P:???}

[i]Attika[/i] is game that is easy to learn, looks great, has intriguing pieces, and a veritable "tech tree" of building relationships that closely resemble a Real-Time Strategy (RTS) game on the PC.  All of these are good attributes.

The 2p game is fantastic.  The 3p game is a bit more hectic, and in some cases play feels a bit forced: are you going to do anything about that other person or do I have to do it?  Minus one point for the drop-off in play.

Ideally, you spend your last card to play your winning tile.  That's a mechanism that I have enjoyed in [i][thing=8217]San Juan[/thing][/i] and in [i][thing=9217]Saint Petersburg[/thing][/i].  Using cards to represent the different resources is a mechanic that I really like.  It worked well for [i][thing=13]The Settlers of Catan[/thing][/i] and for [i][thing=6249]Alhambra[/thing][/i], and it works well here, too.

The welcome frustration of "I wish I could do one more thing" is somewhat diluted by the implementation of "amphoras:" these are basically extra action tokens that can be earned during the game.  One one occasion, my opponent didn't draw the tile that he needed to connect two temples and win the game.  I thought "Whew!  I dodged a bullet!"  Then he played an amphora, and won with the extra move.  Maddening when it happens to you, and exhilarating when you do it to someone else.

Most of the time, [i]Attika[/i] is a wonderful game.  Yet there are still occasions where you can't get ahead of the game due to unlucky tile draws.  If the occasional bout of rampant bad luck doesn't deter you, then you should give [i]Attika[/i] a try.

p: Technically this should be a game that swims comfortably at the high end of my ratings, as it combines many ingredients that usually rub that sweet spot of mine. But I find it hard to rate it any higher as mediocre, as most of the times it bores me to tears.

Someone suggested raiding another box for cubes to help keep easy and more visible track of progress on players' boards, and that alone improved enjoyabality immensely. So with a major annoyance fixed, the richness of the game should come flowing through, right? Nope. Instead the one feeling I can't shake is that despite all the random draws, instead of a opening up a tantalizing variety of tight options, my turn seems to be entirely predetermined by what has been left by my neighbour on the left, and what I certainly don't want to leave for the player on my right. If someone with least to lose skips their "duty" to keep the leading player in check, it will inevitably mean that someone trailing even more can kiss their game goodbye when they take that task. That aspect is present to some degree in most games, but here it can strangle all the fun from game-play.

Pity, it looked so good.

If there ever was a game where the civilization theme was pasted on this is it. Just forget the theme as this game is a 100% abstract. Still it is a very good abstract game. It has a good mix af strategy and tactics, leaning more to the strategical side. Also the quick play and relatively easy rules make it a game you can pull out at he end of a gaming session if you have 45 minutes left. Despite the easy rules it's still a game with great depth. Lot's of planning and difficult decisions to make.

I had a hard time getting over the plodding nature of the gameplay.  Amphoras have such a minor impact on the game, I feel like I'm not getting much bang for my buck on them.  Furthermore, unless someone is completely asleep at the wheel, the game will not end by connecting two temples, and instead plod on until all pieces are played.  Other reviewers laud this as the god of gateway games, but I am just not seeing it.  Not recommended.

I like the simple rules and positional and building tactics that are required, but I'm not really sure if I like the game.  It's too hard to tell from just one play, so we will see after at least one more try.  But, I did find it less interesting than I expected in my first play.

I feel that this game pretends to be more than it is.  From the theme, you'd expect at least some small level of civ/city building, but really the theme is completely pasted on.  This isn't even an area control game.
Taken for the game that it is--an advanced version of Hex--it plays well.  It's straight-forward and plays smooth and quick.  I like it.

Attika is a hard game to review.  On the one hand, I thoroughly enjoy every playing.  On the other, this game has some rather prominent issues.  I agree with the myriad other people that in multiplayer the temple connection win is completely unsatisfactory.  Furthermore, I can't fail to concur that Attika hinges a little too heavily on luck and that the theme is terrible.

Not to completely disparage the game, it does present many enjoyable decisions and a rare strategic layer for a game of its weight.  Attika is the uncommon game of efficiency that is actually fun and engaging.

Not bad for a quick two-player game.  It's basically placement optimization, but the modular board helps make every game a bit different.  Some people whine that it's "broken" as a three or four-player game, and while I understand why they say that I disagree.  It's still pretty fun.

Okay game of hand management and tile placement.  There is plenty of luck in the tile draws (and card draws), but it is tolerable.  As others have said, it's probably better as a 2-player game.  In 3-4p games, everyone needs to play a tight game in order to prevent a runaway leader.  I'm lost if I don't use glass beads or transparent chips to mark off which buildings have already been used.

After many very good games when we first played this (pre game-logging), husband and I had a Really Bad Attika Day playing with a third person. It was embarassing, really. Imagine the Keystone Cops playing Attika - no strategy, pure chaos. We're letting this one sit for a little while, hoping to forget that horrible day. Not there yet.

RATING: 7
Interesting game this, you can add parts of the central board as you go along, you compete for the best places to build improvements that are taken from a Carcassonne-esque blind tile draw. You have different resource cards which you can spend to build things like in settlers and there's a couple of ways to win - either linking 2 shrines together or getting all your buildings out on the board first. The clever way that sets of buildings can be played sequentially adjacent to one another for free means that the game can move and change rapidly. Worth quite a bit of thought, this one!

Attika is a tile-based hex game. Players are attempting to spread their colonies across a Greek island, using resource cards as well as resources printed on the board. The game is a race to do one of two things - either join two temples on either side of the board with your tiles, or get all of your tiles in play.

Attika has a distinct, creative board set-up, makes good use of its theme, and allows solid strategy and tactics in its play.

I reccomend this game to players who enjoy thinking games that still allow for lucky breaks.

Two player games go quickly; a very nice addition to my collection where the desire for a quick-yet-challenging game went previously unfulfilled.  Downgraded my rating from 8.5 to 7: this just isn't holding onto our interest, or making it to the table.

I'm holding off on writing a review until I've played this with a more varied number of people.  However, I love this game.  I've played this with my wife 3 or 4 times now and every game is close.  It is quick to play and quick to teach, There is luck in the selection of tiles.  There is a significant screw-you factor.  There is no in-game text, so it is likely that it will play well with kids.  The only thing is that it doesn't look like there is any deep strategy or long-term tactics.  However, I think this game will get out on the table a whole lot.

Just played this with 4 for the first time and it played well.  In our first game, someone snuck in and positioned himself for an easy win before anyone noticed.  After just the one play, I think this will scale well.  Again: little strategic depth but great fun, quick to teach, and quick to play ( I think our game took about 30 minutes).

Still think it's a good game for non-gamers -- easy to teach, engaging, lit bit of strategy, lots of interaction, and quick to play.  Probably won't ask for it if playing with gamers but will suggest it if playing with non-gamers.

RATING: 7
This is a race game of sorts that is mostly about efficiency.  The more efficient you are in spending your resources, the faster you are going to be able to connect the Oracles and win.  Of course, if you wait until you have the buildings out that allow efficient building, then you've allowed your opponent(s) to build unopposed.  This is the heart of the decision making in the game: build inefficiently now in order to seize the best positions and block your opponent(s), or take actions that allow you to build more efficiently later.  

The kicker here is that the actions that allow you to build more efficiently later refers to drawing buildings randomly from your stack.  Most buildings are free if you have the correct pre-reqs built, so it's important to get those pre-reqs out.  But you don't know where those buildings are in your randomly ordered stack.  The order that your buildings become available to you has a huge impact on the game, and is entirely random. 

There are actions you can take to mitigate the randomness - you can always draw resources instead, which allows you to build whatever you want.  So you're not completely out of the game if your stack turns out to be ordered the "wrong" way.  Still, I can't help but feel that the game gives the perception that it is decided by the building draw, which makes it feel unsatisfying.  

Traded Away.

RATING: 7.5
Need good planning to maximize your development in this challenging tile laying game. All players can take different approaches to building and come out very close. UPDATE: Very tight resource management (cards) with area control strategy (placing buildings) makes this interesting with either 3 or 4 players. The luck of the draw does not impact the outcome nearly as much as the decisions made by the players in building order and placement on the map. The complaint of fairness in forcing the game-saving rescue move on the next player is a valid one - a player can be set back having to build out of sequence to block an player opponent that the other player(s) playing before you ignored. Or, perhaps this can be viewed as a strategy to hamper another player's progress, though this is not a popular view. I can see how this held (briefly) the #1 spot on the game ratings some years ago.

This is an easy to learn strategy game that plays equally well for 2 or up to 4. It's a great way to introduce someone into non-Parker Bros/Milton Bradley games because it introduces elements like resource building and strategy while giving more than way to win the game and without so many rules that it confuses or turns off newbie gamers right away. We, even being very experienced gamers, still really enjoy this game.

Attika is great, particularly for two.  The play is fairly fast, easy to learn, and the city building theme is just deep enough to be believable despite the relative simplicity.  We had Taluva, from the same designer, but that fell flat for both of us, as it was way too quick and had not enough strategy.  Attika requires both offensive and defensive play, which is much more satisfying.

My wife and I finally had a chance to play this, and though reading the rules did not excite me, the game really, really did.

Played with four players and found that the game is equally excellent with two or with four.

This is a fun relatively quick game. There is a fair amount of tense turn taking near the end. A bit of messing with your opponents plans. We played a 4-person game recently and three of us who were playing offensively but somehow weren't paying attention to the one staying out of our way (who won the game). My son and I played a two person and ended up cutting each other off right-n-left. He won by placing all of his buildings. 

It's a worthy game for 2 players, but falls a bit short for more.

Pretty neat.  Kind of reminds me of Through the Desert mixed with Settlers of Catan!  You're generally trying to place "trails" of your pieces across the board, but must use resources in able to build those pieces.

Updated 8/17/10.  

It's official: I'm burned out on Attika.  People seem to love it, and I did too for the first ten plays or so.  But, like most short, light games, I've run out of depths to plumb.   

My gaming group likes to play Attika regularly, as it's arguably the best game in my collection that can be played in 30-60 minutes while waiting for other players to arrive.  The gameplay itself is simple, but getting to the core of the game takes some real thought.  Unfortunately, where I had once viewed that needed thought as strategic depth, I've come to realize that it's primarily a confluence of draw luck and the fact that I'm just mediocre at the game.   

The game is dry, which I'm okay with, and the artwork is attractive, if simple (probably too simple).  I think some of my opponents found it a bit boring thematically.  It would be nice if there were something more of a tie-in to the ancient civilization theme, which I typically adore.  Why some of the minor industry groups could not have produced a resource when completed, I'll never understand.   

The primary distinction between a low 7 and a high 6 is the frequency with which I'm drawn to play a game.  For a 30-minute semi-abstract, Attika managed to hold my interest fairly well. I'm at the stage, however, where I'd rather explore Samurai against an equally skilled opponent than continue to play the same soulless game of Attika again and again.  

Despite the ratings drop due to its shallowness, it is still a very good short game.  I recommend it mostly as a two or three player game (the four-player is fine, but you feel a little out of control) for groups or couples that like some challenge and spatial interaction but that don't want to be weighed down with a brain-burner.

A good game of trying to maximize your turns to get out your tiles as quickly as possible. The threat of a shrine victory keeps players from playing too conservatively for free tile placements.

Sometimes the luck of the draw can just give the game to one player over another.

While the game is enjoyable, I feel it is less tense than Through the Desert, less dynamic than Kingdom Builder, and less quick than Ingenious, which hurts it in a field full of tile laying games that have similar concepts of draw then place as efficiently as possible.

Fun but few strategy opportunites.  Doing well is entirely driven by the luck of the draw.  When you draw a city you either have the resources to place it our not.  If not you place it on your reserve board and hope your next draw is better.

You can't even block the opponents without getting a lucky draw.  The game ends up being who will get the next lucky draw to build on any given location.

Good fun, and plays relatively quickly to boot. I bought this on the whole "Catan" comparison, and that is sort of a crock. This is a resource management race, and you interact with others only to hamper them. The worst problem with this is that the mid-game ends up feeling scripted.

Good, interesting strategic game.  It's downside is that there are only two ways to win, and there are a fairly finite number of choices per turn.  Nonetheless, it's a solid game, and I'm glad I bought it.  It'll hit the table from time to time.

There is enough going on with plenty of gamey elements to really hit a sweet spot for me.  I went into this game with little expectation but came away feeling impressed.  I enjoy competing for the resources on the modular board and also how the "tech tree" functions.  The temple connection mechanic I sometimes see a reference to is really not a problem, at least in a 3 player game.

RATING: 7
Quite fun to play, with lots of opportunities for strategic play.  Eventually, you have to make a move against an opponent, but that usually weakens your position.  So, you try to get someone else to make that move ... Only problem with this game is that it seems pretty much impossible to win by connecting temples except due to poor play by opponents.

RATING: 7
The rules for this game are relatively simple, but it can suffer from analysis paralysis when people try to figure out which of their buildings they can place and which buildings they already have down on the board.

I think most (if not all) my plays of this have been as a 3-player game.  (This is probably at least partly because the store copy we often use is missing some red tiles.)  One of the complaints I've heard and agree with about this as a 3-player game is that there's a strong disincentive for player B to stop player A from completing a path between temples, because player C benefits from the block but player B (usually) has to spend extra resources to make the unwieldy block.

Explaining the possible actions in a turn is...strangely difficult.  You can draw 2 OR build 3; if you draw, you may immediately build drawn tiles (but NOT tiles already on the player board).  Any unused actions can be converted to drawing cards.  Each time I've taught this (or I've watched it taught), someone's had trouble with the concept, and I'm not sure why.

Having played a half dozen times, I have found Attika to be a pleasant game.  But it leaves me with the feeling, "what's the point".  It seems like an abstract strategy game, but it's a weak one, with few options and a dependence on the luck of the draw.  It's a building game, but lacks flavor or an atmosphere.  It supports multiplayer use, but with little interaction beyond the occasional blocking move.  Sadly, it just didn't "catch" me and so was traded.

This game is interesting and very well balanced.  Although you always have several good choices and it pays to plan ahead, the game still moves quickly.  The rules are very clearly written with lots of good examples.  The individual player boards are well thought-out with some rule reminders.  We've played with 2 or 3 players.  Either way, the game is competitive and tense but also enjoyable.

I have enjoyed the games of Attika that I've played, but I don't have a huge interest to play a lot of it in the near future.  My playings have all been two-player with my wife.  There are lots of other two-player games that seem to get more attention than this one at the moment.  Would like to try it with more and see how it plays.  Update: Bumped up the rating since it does seem to get played, and does work well with two.

Just gets better and better with more plays, finally becoming my very first 10.  I'm a sucker for "tech trees", and the building tree in this one works out wonderfully. Have only played with 2 or 3, but it works great with both.  (Yes, with 3 it does have an element of "We have to stop the player to my right, but I'm going to go ahead and play my turn my way and force *you* to stop him".  In some games that bothers me, but in this one it doesn't.  Which says to me that this property in and of itself isn't a problem, but rather this property in combination with some other property that I haven't put my finger on.)

Good medium weight game with a measure of luck balanced by the need for good hand management and skillful play.  It is close to abstract but not quite.  Enjoyed with 2, 3 and 4.  Seriously addicting.   I've had two friends go out and buy this game after playing mine.  This was dropped to an eight from a nine rating due to the fact that it really is a much better game with only two players....but I still like it enough to play it with more.

RATING: 8
An interesting little "filler."  I was curious why it was rated so highly when the turn options seemed so simple.  But it makes for some intriguing decisions as you decide whether to reach for the next shrine or block around the one you protect; to maximize your builds, or sacrifice for more resources.  And just once you think your plan is coming together, more land opens up and your back to hex 1.

A short play, but complete joy.

RATING: 8
Very nice tile laying semi-abstract that plays well both 2p and multiplayer. What keeps it from getting an even higher rating is that topdecking can make or break equal players, especially on 2p where bash the leader is not an option. Still, a comfortable keeper.

---

+ simple rules
+ clean rulebook
+ temple connecting threat
+ force-in-being threat (holding cards in your hand, keeping a full stack of roads on your mat)
+ space vs resource management creates a good tension
+ blockage and screwage
+ tile expansion timing decision
+ paying attention to your opponent's mat is a must (and easy to do)

- a bit theme-braking (abstract), since the city states can be all over the place
- lack of the draw is a bit too high for the weight of the game, and not easy to mitigate

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a very interesting game of tempo, resource management, and territorial control.  It's rather abstract, yet retains several attributes that tie it to the founding and growth of city-states on a very macro level.  My only current worry is that the luck of the draw can be a factor, but it hasn't outweighed good strategy so far.

RATING: 6.5
The first time I played this game (3p), I was not impressed.  Much later I returned to enjoy a 2-player game. THAT'S what everyone is talking about.  There were some fun dilemmas ans some real strategy to be had.

I'm curious as to the win percentage for the player who goes first in 2p games.  Its possible that its not balanced, but the gameplay is sure enjoyable.

One complaint. You really must have some type of markers to designate which buildings you've already built. The game doesn't include anything for that purpose.

RATING: 7.5
In this game, I love the tension in the balancing of building up your mat with tokens (to power up for big moves later) versus getting out there on the board to position yourself and get the good spots.  It has interesting decisions packed in a short timeframe.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Very accessible with it's short rules explanation, yet has plenty of decision making and good play opportunities. Problems however: the game feels very static, things are placed and then sit around collecting dust. The theme, which is normally not a big deal to me, feels very pasted on with this, the game just feels flat out abstract to me. The shrines make this game a little trying when you have more than 2 as well, it's just too difficult to keep track of what everyone is doing everywhere and all too often you are depending on someone else to have the right cards in hand, or to get the right draw to thwart a win, and it just doesn't happen; this is, of course, easily solved by playing it 2 handed only. That said, even at 2 I am never overly eager to pull this out, it's just dry, fairly mechanical, and the theme feels completely like window dressing because none of the buildings effectively function differently, they just cost varying amounts to erect.

RATING: 10
A decent tile-laying game with some good resource management- almost a combination of Go and Settlers in some odd way.  I liked a lot of the mechanics, particularly the way the discounting system worked and trying to gun for the extra actions but ultimately I'm afraid that this is another Euro that has seen a period of plays followed by an impossibly long period of latency, which usually means that the game is on its way out of the collection.  It's not a bad game- intially I liked it a lot, but the combination of a relative lack of depth and a fairly low degree of replayability have made this one lose a lot of its luster.  Still, it's a good one for newbies or folks looking to stay in the shallow end of the pool.

I love Attika as a two-player game, but the 3-4 player game becomes problematic as you have to figure out who's going to waste a turn making a less optimal move just to stop an immediate game-ending threat.

This seems like a pretty good game that would be better with less players. Playing it with 4 became a bit too reactionary.

I gave it a 10!
 What pushes this game to a 10 you ask??..... 3 things 

1)  THE BOX! This is the best package for game component storage around.  Everything has it's spot, you only need one ziplock bag & that bag is included!

2) The components are very high quality, lots of things to "punch out" but none of the tearing or poor results as seen in some other games, the die cuts were perfect, the pieces almost fell out.  Yes there are lots of pieces but they are all nice looking & top quality.

3) The manual explains the game almost perfectly.

RATING: 6
Despite my initial hesitation about not buying this game it did eventually find its way into my collection: when it is on offer at a sale with 70% off its normal retail price, who can resist. The first games I played were not very succesful because of the fact that there are no markers provided to mark the buildings with you already placed, so I cannibalised another game for wooden discs and [i]boy[/i] did that improve matters. It is still annoying that the board itself isn't very clear so that looking for that particular building still takes too much time, but at least you can immediately see which buildings are nicely 'in line' for free placement. I'll definitely order a custom set of markers to make for a permanent addition.

As for the game itself: I find it's growing on me, which is quite unusual given my initial reservations. As with Marcel-André's other big box game I own (Taluva), the devil seems to be in the fact that there are multiple distinct ways to win this game. Fast placement can secure a victory because of connectivity; slow placement can block such a victory from occurring. I'm not quite sure yet how the luck of the draw affects your game, although it goes without saying that a really good draw will have you walk away with the game easily. (This can only be avoided by the other players actively conspiring against you, and this is rare.) There is indeed a 'newbie on the right'-syndrome with this game, but once the newbie gains some experience, Attika definitely becomes interesting and worthwhile fare.

[b]Update[/b] I think I was too forgiving when I wrote the above. Two problems are standing in the way of my everlasting appreciation and Attika's rise to greatness. One is the luck of the draw. It affects everyone, of course, but it certainly helps if, [i]coincidentally[/i], buildings appear in the correct logical order more often than not. It saves you the trouble of going through the actual building action. At the very least it gives you presence on the board, it takes away resources from your opponents, it forces them to be a little more defensive. Attika offers nothing in the way of catching up here. The second thing is that between seasoned players, temple connections are not really a viable [i]strategy[/i] to win. Oh, I'll happily admit that there is always the [i]threat[/i] as to force people to make a few defensive moves, but apart from lack of cards and/or buildings it's not a [i]strategy[/i] you can count on from the outset to win you a game. It's too easy to block if played agressively. That means Attika doesn't really have two viable roads to emerge victorious: the game has just one, plus a sneaky elephant path. If there is just one viable road, then it doesn't seem particularly fair that players are exposed to random draws as they are. And that realisation is a darned shame. Had Attika truly offered two separate and viable roads, and less influence from the random draw, then the tension between the two roads would have created quite an interesting title. As it stands now, I'm not sure that the game is as interesting as I thought...think... it is. Rating downgraded by 1 point as a consequence.

Nice game.  Bit of luck on who draws what.  Goal seems to be to play the tiles that you pick by trying not to put them on your mat.  Connecting temples hasn't really seemed like a threat.

Played three player with sister and brother-in-law.  Seemed to like it more with more players.  Ideal player number is supposed to be 2 player so I will need to experiment with more players again.

Geeksters reference the need of someone to block other players from connecting temples, but I haven't seen that yet.  This is the reasons so many say that this is a better 2-player game.

A clean and clever if dry design. The conflict between immediately building at the expense of continuity or cards, or biding your time and losing actions, offers some pleasantly tense decisions. There is a significant luck factor at work here in the order of tile draws, but  tactical flexibility and aggressive land management in particular can usually compensate. In fact, I find the latter the key element to consistent victory in this game. Also, it works best with two players; the instant win condition ensures that multiplayer games require an unsatisfying number of  right-player blocking maneuvers ("Kill Dr. Lucky syndrome"). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Components: Simple, attractive artwork on the tiles, cards, and tokens. Could only be improved by adding translucent tokens of some sort to cover up those structures already built, to make it more obvious what lurks in the draw piles. It would also be nice to have some symbol on the tokens to indicate their family of structures; it is difficult to verify on the board whether all of one family have been built in proximity to each other.

Experience: Plays quickly. There is a high degree of luck, hoping to draw useful tokens or cards, but it's satisfying to build up efficient chains of structures and to utilize the resources on the board. This game is about efficiency, efficiency, efficiency. And it can be ruthless as we cut each other off.

Magnificent game.  Excellent balancing of resource management, land management, and defense.  Multiple aspects to this game must be mastered to be successful.  Works well with two, three and four players.  While there is some advantage to going first in a two-player game, the additional resources makes up for differences in a game with more than two.  The two-player game is a superior competition between two highly skilled players.  More than two players is enjoyable as well.  I would highly recommend this game to anyone but especially anyone who likes Settlers of Catan without the luck of the dice factor.  It is one of my all-time favorites.

A solid 7. Luck draw on tiles hurts this one by one rating point, and another point off because it's a turn order game where you can force the person who's clockwise just before the game leader into having to cover that person winning the game. (I realize that person has a choice and can just let the leader win, but it's still not my favorite dynamic.) Some elegance in the play. It's a solid game, though quite tactical and so not as popular among the strategists in my gaming family and group.

Okay tile-laying game. Gameplay is interesting and quite tense, but unfortunately this game has very little to do with Civ-building. Artwork is a bit bland.

Nice looking building game, needs both tactics and strategy. It's practically a 2-player game though and needs a lot of analysis which makes it a bit slow.

RATING: 7
Good game, plays quickly and well at 2 or more players (but especially 2). Requires players to really observe opponent's opportuntities for connection wins. If a connection win occurs because people weren't paying attention, it really diminishes the game.

RATING: 7
Attika is an interesting balance of playing efficiently & keeping up enough defense.  The game played faster than I expected, so it might be a good filler.  In our three player game we didn't have much expansion happening.  I would like a couple more plays to see i that is the norm.  I would recommend giving it a try if you get the chance.

Good light game.  As with many I think 2-player is my favorite.  3 & 4 is good but does have the tendency for players to sometimes find themselves having to decide among them who will make a play that is not good for themselves to block the leader.  This is ok with good friendly table negotiation but bugs some super serious folks.

very enjoyable tile-laying game with resource mgmt. thinking game but not a brain burner. mixture of go, othello, settlers. scales very well from 2-4 players. high replayability due to modular board. discover subtleties with every play. highly recommended.

I don't know why, but i like this game. It feels quite strategic, but somehow it also doesn't. Maybe it's just awesome when you can place tiles for free. Things for free are always awesome, especially when you get a lot of them :P

RATING: 7
The first player to build a chain of buildings connecting two shrines wins. Alternatively, building all 30 buildings is also a win condition.

Building requires resources which are on the modular game board as well as in your hand of cards. As the board grows during the game, more resource spaces become available.

With some patience and planning, many buildings can be built without resources, as long as they are adjacent to their "base" building. This can form chains of free buildings which can in turn yield extra turn tokens.

All in all, a nice mostly tactical skirmish to try to outmaneuver or outbuild the other player. Not nearly as heavy as I was expecting, though... two-player games can easily be only 30 minutes.

Juego a priori interesante pero a posteriori tras ver que una de las dos estrategias es impracticable y la otra tiene mucho factor azar...

RATING: 7
Very good game for 2 or 3 players.
As a 2 players game, both players should have the same skill/knowledge level, otherwise fast shrine connections are quite easy to happen.
As a 3 players game it's challenging, since you have to keep in check plenty of things.

Two player seems to work really well, but I found the four player version required a bit more time to ensure no one was going to run away with a temple win and the issue of who's going to take one for the team. Its quite an unforgiving game for the unwary, but now we're used to it, the run away temple wins have stopped.

Played this one again yesterday and I have to say, that it is a really good (and cutthroat) two player game. The two different winning conditions really let this game shine and the luck factor that is introduce by the tile-draw prevents the game from getting repetitive. Not to forget, this is a very unique design. While playing Attika, I don't have the feeling that I have played this kind of game a hundred times before. Thumbs up for this one!

My rating comes with a caveat - the rules as written for the game with more than two people are so awful as to piss a person off.  There are fixes for that, I'm led to understand.  More importantly, the game works, and works fairly well as a two player game.  It's still not one I'll seek out because of the frustrating luck factor, but I'd happily play it again as a two player only game.

I passed on the opportunity to buy this in  Essen thinking that it looked a lot lot like a fairly minor variation on hex. With the enthusiasm evident for the game since then I relented and bought a copy. After a few plays I can say I am glad I did. The game has some interesting twists and a variety of strategies to it that make it a great game in it's own right regardless of it's heritage. I'm not sure yet if it will continue to enjoy a favoured status, but at the moment I would willingly play it at any time.

Didn't care for the 3er version of this game.  It felt like 2 players moved towards victory while I was somehow the only one in the position of stopping them. All the while, I could not advance my position.  So in essence, I played kingmaker.  I think this is likely to happen quite often in a 3er game of this.  I'm not rating it too low though because I think I'll like it much better as a 2er game.

RATING: 8
Players play Corinth, Sparta, Athens or Thebes, and are in a race to be the first to either connect two shrines with a chain of their buildings, or be the first to complete all their 30 buildings.  Buildings are either drafted from stacks and built immediately, or held on a playing mat for later consideration.  Builds from the playing mat take a separate turn (ie. slower) but allow for more economical planning, which could end up being faster.  Very simple mechanics, tough decisons about timing, space on the playing area, and resources.  Interesting game.

RATING: 8
I wasn't sure I liked this game at first. The "connection victory" is all too easy to achieve when new players are facing off with one another and not playing good defense. And generally I think that if a game is going to fall apart if players don't behave within certain "guidelines," those might as well be the rules. (Taj Mahal and Fifth Avenue being prime examples of games that are weak if players don't use them as intended by the designers.)

And yet, if you can get over this hurdle, Attika emerges as a very satisfying game. A little bit of luck (but not too much), a nice ability to plan ahead, but also the potential to have to reformulate those plans when your opponents butt up against you and interfere.

I love building games & connection games -- Attika is a nice blend of the two. Most of the games I've played have ended in very tight games, whether with two or three (I've yet to play with four.) A quick tip -- use glass drops to record on your mat which buildings you've built. For those builings you built that don't touch the others in the group use a different colored drop. This helps keep track of completed groups -- would hate to miss out on getting an amphora, right?

There are too many better games out there that playing this game on a regular basis is a waste of time.

This a good non-Kosmos 2 player game, that can accommodate more players, but works best with 2.  I like that you have build orders which allow buildings to be played for free.  One thing I don't really like is that there is a fair amount of randomness, in that there is 4 stacks of tiles which are random, the resources on the board are layed out randomly and cards that you draw are also random.  I think the more strategic player will win, but it takes the game down a notch in my eyes.  I find you do need to play it a few times before you can wrap your head around the strategy.  Give it a try on BSW to see if it's right for you.

[3 plays] I won my first game of this because I wasn't the only one at the table who didn't know what they were doing.  By the 3rd 4-person game (I hear there's a different, possibly better dynamic with three), it had become kind of stalematey.  Whenever someone is prospering, whoever can manage it has to take one for the team and block them, but if people are thorough about the thwarting, you end up with everyone in hopeless condition.  I felt like the main activity of the game was keeping each other from winning.

Very high quality components (thick card / detailed artwork);
Simple rules;
Can play 2 x 2 player games simultaneously;

Cons:
Not easy to win if all your buildings come out in the 'wrong' order;
You need to provide your own markers to cover the building spots on your player mat, after the buildings have been built (unless you have an incredible memory.)

Highly recommended for all levels of gamers.

Great quick game, and the flowchart REALLY appeals to me for some reason.  Game can either be a 10-minute washout or a 1-hour fight to the finish; it's either tense and great or over so quickly that you can just play again.  I've only played with 2 players so far.

Bumped down to 6, it really hasn't held up all that well.

Bumped it down again.

I just don't see much to this game. It usually ends up being a race to see who can put all of their tiles on the board - which is fine and dandy, but just doesn't catch me. Unless you get extremely unlucky/don't pay attention for several rounds, you shouldn't leave yourself open to having an opponent touch two shrines. I've tried it a few times and may try once or twice more before getting rid of it. People say it shines with two, but there are dozens of games I find more engaging.

I played &amp; bought this at Essen and hugely enjoyed it. The placement rules appear simple (but we had some questions about the sequence). The game turns on the decreasing resources. As tiles go down covering available resources, players must use more cards to complete their city. So getting your road tiles down early seems important. When you clear a stack of tiles, you place a new land &#039;hex&#039;. So you must have resource cards in your hand to maximise this opportunity, otherwise the other players simply exploit the fresh land. It seems timing matters a lot, but also card-counting skills too. All the tiles are illustrated on your city sheet, all the resources needed are shown, so you should be able to work out what you still need &amp; how to be efficient. I was stuck at the end because I lacked any water. Brilliant quick game, a must buy and a hit at the show. I got mine for 18 euro.

Played 30+ times with 2, 3, and 4 players for 17+ hours.

The initial buzz was that it was like/better than Settlers of Catan. The similarity is in the resource cards and paying to place down, but it is very much its own game as you seek to exploit resources on the board as well as combinations of free placements. I had only been playing this as a gateway game, and found it pleasant, but not terribly interesting. Then I taught it to a guy who is a real gamer: suddenly Attika has taken on new life. This game can be played in several style: quick, sleek, slapdown as you try and get cheaper building down for free on a board with a lot of visible resources; slower, more methodical setting up building-set combos to limit expenditure; cheap buildings to make a chain to go for a connection win, etc. itself isn't much more than the sum of its parts. Where I once thought it was a pleasant and mildly competitive tile placement game that fills a nice spot in my collection, I now find that amongst stronger players, is quite the game.

Ok, there's only 2 things I can do during my turn: draw or build.  So how come it is so agonizing to actually choose between the two?
Simple mechanics with a familiar ressource management conendrum.  Plays fast and provides lots of difficult choices.

Update: Having played more recently (BSW mostly), I realize that there are a number of set options which you must take.  Since the order of drawing will have a major impact on the possible building actions, randomness rears its ugly head in an annoying fashion.  Ex: a quick way to yield a connection victory (granted it's not easy), is to have all 4 roads available with a few bonus turns in hand.  That is only possible if the right tiles are drawn.  I'm not saying I wouldn't play again, I just feel that there is probably a recipe which will yield a better chance of winning given a minimum luck.  This has to affect replay in the long run.

Seemed decent, but I just didn't see with competent play how anyone could possibly connect two temples in a two player game.  If it were a distinct possibility I would have liked it a lot more.  In 3 and 4 player this happens, but sometimes in a bad way where you have to sacrifice your own play severely just to stop someone else from a possible win.

Interesting tile-laying / building game. Resource management factor is only hamstrung by the luck of the tile-draw. Can be improved by turning up the top tiles of each stack, so each player can plan ahead a bit more (along with the use of the player board). *** UPDATE: The randomness of the tile and card draws killed this game for me. If you're keeping count: Random city tile draws, random land tile draws, random resource card draws, and if playing with more than 2P, the player interaction usually won't go to equilibrium unless you're playing with experienced, rational people. Attika is not a horrible game, but I can't take it seriously.

Attika is on my shorlist of games to present to my non-gamers friends without any risk. It's key advantages: explainable in 5 minutes; great with 2, 3 or 4 players; tension of play from start to finish;finishes under 1 hour.
Despite looking very simple at first, this game offers many strategic options to follow, some of them quite subtle. This is great for more advanced players.
At the end the winner can see its own city complete with all the buildings that are required for a civilized life, producing a delighful scenary.

Meh? It's okay, but I find myself not really understand the massive praise from some quarters. It seems to occupy some not-very-successful middle ground between fillers and heavier games, and I feel there's too much of a need for one player to make a sacrifice to block a win.
Edit: Upped it to a 7 after playing (and winning :-)) a couple of 3-player game. It still suffers somewhat from the "Kill Doctor Lucky"-syndrome, as Chris Farrell calls it, but it's not as bad as in the 4-player and there seemed to be more jockeying for juicy positions on the board.

Két-három játékossal jól működik néggyel még nem próbáltam.

Several plays.  I like it.  If the group is thinking together, then it should be hard to connect two shrines, and it will be a build-a-thon to the end, where the endgame tension is good.  Also the victim of the Kill Dr. Lucky syndrome doesn't feel as jilted in this game as in, say, Settlers where people are actively trading goods to help #2.  The worst the group can do to the leader in this game is point out the obvious.

Received 1/13/04 from Game Surplus. Have now played it over 90 times F-T-T and 60 times on BSW. I love it more each time I play it. This one has the marks of a classic: Simplistic play, agonizing choices, relatively short game length, and strategy! Did I say I love this one? 
2007 -  I am now in my 3rd year of playing this one - and it has not lost any of its glamor for me. Still the best game I own. I now consider it my favorite game, edging out Euphrat & Tigris which reigned as my favorite for 7  years.  Tons of angst. 
Tonight (6/18/07) we played another nail biter. I had 12 buildings left, Ken only 6, and Brent 8. Ken placed two buildings leaving him only 4. I placed 6 on one turn (using 3 amphorae all collected on the that turn). That left me with 6 to Ken's 4. Then Ken placed 2 more buildings leaving him only 2! I placed 3, leaving me 3, but more importantly, blocking up the only spot on the board Ken could place one of his last buildings. On his turn he could only place one. Ken, having no cards, and no now unable to place his last building, had to draw cards. I then placed my final 3 buildings to win! Thus, I placed twelve buildings in three turns! Brent meanwhile, was down to his last building and would have won had I not been able to place my buildings. Ken effectively finished 3rd! What a game!
2009 - Still at the top of my list despite all the greats that have come out in recent times: Dominion, Race for the Galaxy, Small World, Agricola, Le Havre, Endeavor, Automobile, etc. 
2010 - Still number one, but seldom played anymore with so many games to play and teach newcomers. 
2011 - Got to play it again in November and it reminded me why I love this game. It holds total fascination for me. I love its design and the strategic and tactical elements. This is very much like a card game, and you have to know how and when to play your cards (discs actually). This is a game of timing and space. IMO the luck of drawing is no more than in any card game. It's how you use the cards and the timing of their use that wins games. Still my all-time favorite game. 
2016 - Still playing it. Still loving it. Now my most played game, having surpassed Race for the Galaxy. While RftG has lost some of its appeal, this one has stayed at/near the top of my all-time favorites.

Attika is fantastic!  It certainly has a lot of smarts behind it; Merkle is a fantastic designer and this game doesn't feel like any other tile-placing game I know of. There are lots of things to consider in the game: there is a heavy dose risk taking, great interaction and screw-your-opponent mechanics, and simple design.  I like it as a 2- to 3- player game.  I wonder if I would tire of it after many plays, but until then Attika is one of the nicest tile placement games around!

Attika is an interesting tile placement/area enclosure game.  Although most games of Attika afford you the ability to balance the luck, some outings are throw aways simply because one player has amazing draws while the other is battling their tiles.  I haven't played enough times to consider if there are any viable strategies to counter the tile draws, but because of this inconsistency I can't give Attika a higher rating.  The quick playing time and simplicity of the rules makes this an easy sell for non-gamers who want a little more conflict in a game.  It is this accessability that makes Attika a seven for me, however I am not sure how much this will rise.  

UPDATE:  After a good amount of plays I will state that I find Attika to be a solid seven.  There is always the problem with Attika that it never seems to offer much diversity in experience.  All games feel very similar.  However, with that said the game it offers is solid and enjoyable.  Not much possibility for movement.

Well thought-out tile laying game where you have to keep blocking your opponents from making the crucial connection between temples, even if it costs you an arm and a leg.

RATING: 9
An excellent strategy game.  You must contend with "the luck of the draw", finite resources, timing, and liberties (as defined in Go).  

Beware of being compelled to stop someone else's connection threat.  Its not bad in a 2 player game, but in a larger game, the pressure falls on the person to the right of the threatening player.  If everyone is sharp, this balances out, but you may find that getting everyone to that point may be too frustrating.

RATING: 6
After one play - seems interesting. We'll see...

EDIT: Attika has its own charme and very unique mechanics but it lacks something. With 2 players it's confrontational, with 3 and 4 there is some kingmaking issue. Altogether a fine game for people looking for something new.

At first, Attika seems somewhat chaotic and unpredictable. After couple games it, however, proves to be a very interesting and quite quick building-game. There are some rather trivial decisions, but most of the time you need to think your moves carefully or you'll end up regretting it later on. I think there is even more depth to the game, so the rating might go up after couple more sessions.

After a couple of plays I'm still feeling this one out.  Seems to be very defensive at first as you block, follwed by a race to get all your tiles down.  Keen to re-try.

RATING: 7.5
Sweet, sweet tile placement.  The real decisions are when to hold out for freebie combinations and when to play what you have while the resources and space are available.  I play with the 3 amphora variant for temple connection.  That gives a substantial advantage without ending the game due to some lucky road draws.

RATING: 8
A very good game of strategy and calculation (of the "can I risk waiting another turn?" variety) that works very well as a head-to-head struggle. With three players, there's a minor risk of there being a Kingmaker/spoiler, but there are ways round that. With four, I imagine it could get very messy, very quickly!

RATING: 6
Tic tac toe meets Ticket to Ride? Attica is easy to learn and seems simple at first. Yet, there are a lot of choices available because of turns options, a staging area, expandable game board, and runs of tile placement. I am warming up to this game, and it works well with two.

Interesting game, works well with two players which is always a plus for me. Nothing but punched cardboard bits in this one, but they are nicely done and heavy enough to last. 

Not really deep strategically here, the free-building aspect and the random tile draws pretty much eliminate that option, but still enough to maintain some forward planning so its not completely reactionary.

A solid strategy game with area control and empire-building elements as well as a do-unto-others component. A small element of luck is involved, as what you build and when depends on the draw of the tokens. Still, it's what you do with your draw and where you decide to build that makes the difference in this game. It may take one play session to get a real feel for the strategy involved. It offers deep play.

RATING: 6.5
Components: good
Complex: easy
Weight: Light
Players: 2 (for more use the variant for not winning with temples)
Length: ok
Personal: you only have 2 options in your turn, get tiles to place or select them from previous ones. but the race in the board and the timing when you get the tiles and expand the board is what make the game good. With more than 2 players I highly recommend not use the win condition of connecting temples
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Simple systems interact to create complex, interesting decisions.  The pleasant, easy rules disguise a surprising amount of depth and intricacy.  Each game plays differently due to the number of variables.  Some players have complained about situations in which someone must block a winning move - but everyone would prefer that someone else perform the block. I'm not bothered by this, but those who are bothered might prefer to eliminate the problem by only playing head-to-head games.  Personally, I like it equally well with 2 or 3 players, but would usually choose something else with 4.  I've heard repeatedly here on BGG the accusation that Attika was a flash in the pan, and that it played out after a few plays. I can't speak for anyone else, but for me that couldn't be further from the truth.  I'm still extremely enthusiastic about it.

I have had different reactions to this game. Some love it; some are bored. I can see both opinions.

Attika had to grow on me. I learned to like the game when I learned the area-control aspect of it. As soon as I started making building decisions based on how it would impact the spaces on the board, I grew to like the game much more. Before then it was an exercise in efficiency and a little dull.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Two or three plays on BSW. The game play felt like a competitive efficency problem that a computer would enjoy more than a human being, and the player interaction seemed too simplistic, as often you were either moving ahead or blocking but were rarely able to do both with the same move. Most importantly, if you're playing a multiplayer game, there will be awkward situations where someone should perform a blocking move but whoever does will have to slow their own progress to do it. Meanwhile, as a two-player game, it just can't compete with the Gipf series or even the Kosmos two-player series. In short, I didn't like it, though I can understand how others might go for it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I enjoy Attika, but find that others don't.  It's a good game with some interesting decisions to make.  However, the luck factor keeps it from being a great game.  Most of the games I've played have come down to who gets all their buildings out rather than connecting 2 shrines, but there is often at least 1 player who came close to making a connection for a win.

The artwork is wonderful in its simplicity, but the game itself seems to have waned after the initial flurry. I still like it, but the decisions to be made are generally rather simple. UPDATE- I finally got to play it 2-player, and I liked it quite a bit. I can see why many people prefer it this way. Clearly, 3-player is not the way to go because of the inherent king-maker problem, but with 2 that disappears. Looking forward to trying again with just 2.

RATING: 8
Essentially a race game, Attika has you collecting resources to place tiles that, in turn, control the area of the board. It has a puzzle feel. There is a "tech tree" system on top of it all that allows tiles to be built for free if they are connected to certain tiles. Unique in its puzzle elements, Attika is a great "puzzle euro" that plays well at all counts.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Seems like an unnecessarily complicated connection game.  The game could be more if city tiles were left to player decision rather than randomly drawn, but an alteration would turn the game into too straight of a math problem.  I'll pass on this.

RATING: 7.5
Simple game of constructing buildings, with the twist that the resources one uses may come directly from the board. The winning condition of connecting two shrines adds some interesting placement decisions and forces players to keep an eye on the opponents. However, blocking is often costly, and that is probably the main problem with the game, if played with more than two players.

This was a surprise.  Was looking for it for a while, when I picked it up, I was disappointed.  Basic card management system, and it does get to be a race to see who can build all the pieces.  But, it's still fun.  And on that rare occasion that someone (anyone) actually wins the hard way, it's good as a 3 or 4 player game.

This is a beautiful looking game, and I really enjoy the theme. I've only played this two player, but I find it very entertaining.

And I get to build things in this game, which I like.

Played it twice this weekend.  Definitely seems to reward players who have played it before. (Although I don't know exactly the strategy that "wins" it seems to pay to have played it more than once)  Definitely an impetus game; don't "waste" too many moves, the game appears like not much would separate the players, one time second would have finished his 30 buildings immediately after 1st's winning turn, in the second game it would have been 2 turns (but the person who had never played was at least 4 or 5 turns behind the 2 who had played before) (Played 2 player recently and this certainly doesn't seem as good as multiplayer)

Wow- really fun little tile laying efficiency engine game.  Oddly themed as building a little kingdom or something, it is pretty abstract.  Despite an aversion to overly abstracted games this one really captured my attention.  The dual victory conditions keep all the players paranoid and the system itself is very easy to grasp.  There are a surprising number of strategies to take considering how simple the game is.  I thought the free placement strategy was going to be strong, but other players were doing just as well only building every other turn but doing so in better spots due to their use of cards.  I can't wait to play it again.

RATING: 6
This is a reasonably short game -- about an hour in length.  It starts slow, but it ends in a big hurry.  A typical game end is that a player will play all 4 of their roads to connect to two temples.  The first road costs 5 cards minus the number of resource symbols on the neighbouring spaces, but the next 3 roads are free (if adjacent).  So, if you have one amphora, you can play all 4 roads, then win an amphora for completing the road group, then use that amphora to play another building.  That's 5 building tiles in one turn, which can be a surprise attack to win the game.

There are several things to balance here -- drawing your building tiles on your player board so that you can plan to play them in long chains, vs. playing them immediately on the game board as soon as you get them to claim space quickly on the board; collecting resource cards to allow you to play anywhere on the board; and blocking other players' expansion.

The one major thing that is missing from the game is a set of chits to indicate which of the buildings on your player board have already been built (and are already on the game board).  This helps you realize when you have a parent building that will allow you to play a child building for free, and also allows you to realize how close you are to collecting an amphora for building a whole group of buildings.  It also helps other players see these things too -- otherwise, there's way too much to keep track of in this game!

Attika is deeply refreshing. It presents itself as an interesting variation on many things that might otherwise seem like a trope in gaming at this point in time. As both an abstract connection game, a resource conversion/optimization game with hand management, this unholy union presents itself as something relatively unique yet relatively strong in the rules-to-depth ratio. The fact that is it both, yet neither, simultaneously might also have been part of the inspiration for the author to present two competing sets of victory conditions which fit both typical styles of games (i.e., win by connecting the ends & be the first to optimize your resources to build all the buildings, or 30 VP if you prefer thinking about it that way). Regardless, optimal building patterns can help you get closer to building a path across, and coming remotely close to achieving the connection certainly forces your opponent to really lock it down through what often is sub-optimal play of resources.

All in all, with a clever, short, and straight-forward enough rules, a solid production which includes modular boards, I can't see myself growing too tired of this game quickly.

RATING: 7.5
The multi-hex tiles reminded me at once of Taluva, but this game has more going on in conflict and competition, though perhaps less in beauty.

Attika is a 2-4 player game where players utilize resource cards, board resources (on randomly placed starting tiles), and wise placement of building tiles to create a city state. Victory is obtained by linking (2) temples on the crowded boards, or by completing all 30 buildings before their opponents.

There is a very nice balance between resource management (building tiles, resource cards), and expansion opportunity (placing buildings- sometimes for free, completing sectors, placing bonus terrain tiles).

The box itself is lovely, and the Building tiles are nice and solid; the resources are slightly artistic- enough to break some of the resemblence to Catan; the map tiles are very plain, but functional.

Because the assembled maps are small and fill quickly, blocking seems a major strategy, at least to prevent an easy win by connection.  Choices abound, at least until the end when the maps are mostly static and fairly full, but the play is simple enough not to drag, and the game seems well balanced for 2, 3 or 4 players.

This is even more fun to play than Taluva, and I'm really glad I could finally grab a copy. Starting rating is a 7.5, based on 3 solo plays.

It doesn't look all that good, and the strategy isn't that deep. I've played a dozen 2 player games, and by the 5th turn we've always been able to tell who was going to win.

Except for box, all components in near-mint conditions – or "very good", I guess, according to BGG standards, since it seems that the moment you play something you can't say "like new", which in my mind is what describe the condition best.

Box itself shows wear on corners and some edges, both on the box cover and the inside box. "Good" condition by official BGG standards.

I find this game very relaxing to play.  The main strategy is economising your drawing and laying of tiles, whilst attempting to sneak a "connection" for an instant win.  If you play against a half decent player then such connections are nearly always blocked, in which case the victor will be the one who drew and played tiles most efficiently.

RATING: 5
I like this game, but there's a part that irks me and it's the cop aspect of the game.  If someone is moving to win by connecting two temples, there's a collective sigh from the other players and someone rolls up their sleeves and mashes that players attempt at the win.  This leads to the player who was cop to be at a disadvantage.

Still it usually plays fast and is pretty fun for the time spent.

RATING: 6
A rather dry, dull connection game with some luck of the draw and a pasted-on theme. This is all about optimising the placing of your 'buildings' to get them out as quickly and cheaply as possible. Each player proceeds at much the same pace, so the winner will most likely finish just one turn ahead of the rest. Although I'm very much a fan of abstracts, I'm rather less enamoured of a game that's just pretending to have theme.

RATING: 7.5
Cute tile laying game that has a little too much luck for me.  If you can get over the luck hurdle however, it contains a good strategy mechanic that rewards the frugal player.  Unlike other Euros, this system allows you to more directly interact with opponents on the game board.  For example, the main objective is to build for as cheap or free as you can. You can severly hamper an opponents build spaces by laying your cheap buildings  close to their base buildings.

Rating will probably improve with more plays. Would be better with English language components. I found the counters a little hard to read. Maybe icons that are more striking would have been better than the pretty, little pictures. It reminds me a more political Durche Die Wuste, as it is quite abstract and uses connection. I prefer Durche Die Wuste as it is more elegant.

I played this once prior to 4/29/07.  I must admit, the first play made the game seemed much better.  Perhaps since we played two player this time, it wasn't so good.  It's a fairly quick play considering the rules and it's a quick play.  I'd recommend giving this a game play or two.  I don't know if it's worth consideration to be a regular in your game play rotation however.  Update, I played this again with 4 and it's a much better game and worth consideration in playing as a four player game.

Need to give it another go as we didn't quite grasp the rules and strategies the first time.

Update: 2.5 years later and finally got it back to the table. Wow! That was fun. It really clicked this time. Although not a very heavy game, we think we tried this one too soon after getting into board gaming. Now we were able to follow the rules easily and develop some tactics as we played. Nice.

Works great for two, and the theme, although pasted on, is cool. Upping my rating a full point.

Sep08: A very enjoyable game.  It had many interesting decisions.  I don't like Hex, but this game almost made the connection win seem exciting.

I really like the struggle to be efficient in your actions.  Those darn carrots are so alluring.  I've only played 2-player, so I haven't seen pass-the-buck game play yet.  I really don't like the thought of that.

We'll see how much replay value there is in it however.

Attika is a simple network building game. For establishing the ancient civilization, players need to erect their various buildings by using certain resources. Attika has easy rules to learn. The game progress is very quick and smooth. In this way, Attika provides enough fun. No matter what the game is, Attika is not a tactical game actually. The aspect of game is usually determined by card luck. If someone who like light version of euro-game, the game is a good choice.

Enjoyed this game, nicely put together and really pleasing to look at (even the box cover is beautiful!).

Game involves building a variety of structures on the game board, which all require different resources in order to construct.  The big twist being that all of the available buildings are in families, where the 'child' building can be built adjacent to it's 'parent' without cost.  Therefore the main tactic is trying to build the parent buildings in such a way that you can simply place all the children down at the end of the game without challenge.  Simple premise but made interesting with all the players vying for space and resources on the board.

My only gripe is that it is a little easy to block the other player's route to (one of) the victory conditions, and it can happen pretty much right at the start of the game.

Definitely not the "second coming" of Settlers of Catan that some people think it is but it's still very fun.  It combines some elements of Settlers (buying buildings with different resource types) and Carcassonne (placing tiles/buildings) but it's a much different game from both.  For the most part, the game plays somewhat quickly but it occasionally suffers from "analysis paralysis" as there's lots of potential moves you can make in a turn.  The components (especially the cards) are of very good quality, although the player boards are a little too thin.

RATING: 7
Good light/med game even if nothing new to introduce and a little dry. Very simple to play and no victory points, just two different ways to win. One involves trying to connect two points on the board influencing your placement decisions and ensuring you keep an eye on when to block your opponents, the other is building all your buildings.

Nothing at all like Settlers as there is no trading or resource production. Planning for efficiency and some timing aspects are the keys to winning making for a little more strategy than first appears while still staying fairly light and fast playing. Best with just 2

This /is/ the second coming of Settlers. "Second coming" means that it is better than the first! Seriosuly, this game has all the strengths of Settlers (except for the trading, but it has got everything else), and doesn't have many of its weaknesses (such as dice luck and rich-gets-richer problem). It has got the simplicity and fast pace of play which La Citta lacks. The theme is even better than Settlers, with many different types of buildings with different characteristics without the introduction of dozens of exception rules. Playability-wise, there are more flexibility and more real options during play, while there is also a suitable amount of luck.

I've played this twice now and I do enjoy it. My biggest issue with the game is the reliance on one of the players to "jump on the grenade" to stop another player from winning.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (June 2017)

Attika has been one of the games I most wanted to play since I began playing boardgames in early 2010, so I was expecting a great game and it wasn’t that great, still I kind of like it.

The rules of the game are very easy to teach, you can do it under 10 minutes.

The theme is ok, but you don’t feel it through the game.

The games components and art is ok.

Best with 2 players or 3 fast players although is seems it can have some king making issues with 3 or 4 players.

The game´s decisions aren’t that complex. You have two main actions .You build a building from your board or you draw more buildings. Instead of doing any of these actions you can get more cards to build later. The goal of the game is to build all your buildings or to connect two sanctuaries together. Sometimes you need to block your opponent, but I don’t feel the game´s decisions are hard to process and that’s a shame, I was expecting a heavier game.

Luck of the draw can be high as you can build for free some building if you build its prerequisite at the same time. There is also luck of the draw with the cards. I’m still unsure how I feel about this. I need more play to verify but my gut feeling says it will be an issue for me.

Bottom line, I somewhat like Attika. I was expecting a heavier game but it´s decisions are rather simple. Luck of the draw (tiles and cards) can be high and I dislike that. It is mostly a tactics game, planning long time can to be hard to do.

RATING: 7
Players create four shuffled stacks of tiles and each turn can draw two from any stack or build tiles that were previously placed on their player boards. When you draw, you can place directly to the main board or, if you can't afford the cost or want to wait, you can play it to your player board. The main board consists of tiles that consist of 7 build spaces, three of which depict resources. The number of starting tiles depends on the number of players. Every tile has a cost in resources to build which can be paid by a combination of playing in proximity to the resources on the board and by cards played from your hand. However, the player boards depict groupings of buildings with a relational flow. If you can build adjacent to an already constructed building that is previously connected by the depicted flow, you can build it for free. A key piece to getting ahead in this game is arranging your tile draws to take advantage of as many free builds as possible. The first player to connect two temples (which start on opposite sides) or place all of their tiles wins.

The tile draws create a fair amount of randomness and it is possible for a good shuffle to make it relatively easy to build a lot of free buildings, which would be tough to beat. For the most part, though, this is a game about assessing the best move each time you draw and is very tactical. It is enjoyable. It's the kind of game I think I don't really need, but more than one geekbuddy has said they got rid of it only to regret it and pick it up again later. I'd better be sure before I make that choice!

I think the HYPE totally killed this game for me.  After all the raves I read about this game, I was so disappointed after playing it.  To be fair, its not really a "bad" game - I could see why some people may like it, but there's nothing there to inspire me to want to play it again.

Solid game, one that was played alot for the first 2-3 years after it came out but which for some unknown reason has been lost in the shuffle.  Probably it's best as a 2-player, otherwise you get involved in the discussion about whose responsibility it is to spend the extra resources to block someone from a shrine connection.  Like a glorified version of Tic-Tac-Toe, most games should 
"go the distance" without a shrine connection win, but it's surprising how often they don't.

Interesting game.  But, I can't quite yet suss out the balance between skill and luck.  Luck seems pretty high, with the building draws and card draws.  7.5 for right now, but if luck goes up, rating might go down, and vice versa.  I like a good balance between the two, but I'm not sure yet if this game has that balance where I like it...

UPDATE: after a few more plays at different playing numbers, upgrading from 7.5 to 8.5.  Luck is definitely there, but not overly so, not too much.  The game scales really well among different players, with the strategy changing a lot depending on player number.  There's a lot going on under the deceptively simple surface.  For example, in 4 players - you can start strategically stockpiling buildings, or you can jump into the landscape and take advantage of the terrain tiles.  You can start trying to connect shrines or just build based on terrain.  Do you do terrain-based building or block others from their prime building spots?  There's all kinds of blocking decisions going on, and players have to either take it on themselves to block or block others.  Then the tile addition decision adds a whole other layer.  Really nice game.

I like the civilization building aspect to this game. There are a few alternate paths to victory, but I couldn't shake the feeling that the chip draw random order added a little too much luck.

Also, the player mats need a way to easily record what chain of buildings you've already placed. Scanning the hexes seems rather inconvenient.

Overall enjoyable experience.

This was a nice tile laying game in which you can gain discounts by placement on or adjacent to resources on the board, or by the order of building the tiles. It did get confusing figuring out which tiles had been placed on the board. Using markers on the tiles that are built makes this easier. The rules are fairly simple, but there was a nice amount of depth. The tile laying part is fun. On my third play I realized that to do well you need to spend half your time trying to block other players and debating who will do this. This also makes the game more combative and not as fun for my tastes.

RATING: 6
This game works much better at 2p. When you add more players it becomes a bit silly because players feel forced to stop someone from winning, however in doing so they worsen their own position. That is, the game is plagued with king making.

At 2p it is a tight and interesting game with maybe a bit too much luck for my tastes.

I've had good success with this as a "next step" game. It definitely has some depth to it that I haven't figured out yet. Love the fact that it doesn't use VPs, and that one of the victory conditions is there simply to drive interaction.

I love the theme, the gameplay "looks" great and Attika leaves you with a great first impression. In retrospect, a lot depends on the randomness of the tile draws and the game can descend into analysis paralysis. It's OK and I'll play it, but I think I'm done recommending it.

I seem to be easily swayed by the majority opinion on BGG, which seems to be that this game is just okay.  I enjoyed my 2-player game, but two games has not revealed much depth.  I will reserve final judgement until I have a few more plays.  I think my rating could easily go up or down.  It doesn't seem like it would be fun with more than 3 players.

Update: After having traded the game away and reacquiring it, I have reevaluated my stance on the game.  It plays quickly and is relaxing, meaning relatively simple decisions with quick turns.  I would be happy to play this as a 2 or 3 player game but would refuse with higher numbers or with players that take more than 15 - 20 seconds on their turn.

Players attempt to build a line of buildings from one edge of the board to another. Its that simple.

RATING: 9
The game really shines with two players.  I don't think it works with three or four but I love it with two.  Many great decisions to be made in a very short space of time.  I like to have the ability to mitigate luck of the draw with careful play.  There is a good ammount of push your luck and reading the opponent to know when to build which leads me to feel like I am winning the game because of my play not becasue I got the right cards at the right time.  There is some times that you get teh right card at the right time but it is not overly luck based in my opinion.

There is a lot going on with this one, and a few plays are needed to have a sense for what all the different buildings, costs, and build orders are.  You need to strike a balance between having enough cards, having enough buildings to build, and getting buildings on the board.  Makes for some very nice decisions.  Interesting and tense.

Area control-ish game where you nominally build a city by drawing and putting down tokens on a hexagon grid, supplementing resource expenses with terrain and chaining discounts. There's a threat of an instant connection victory, but mostly the game should come down to constant efficiency gains in terms of costs and actions. The theme is complete bullshit; cities don't work that way.

Fun, simple, seems like the strategy is not very subtle however.  Plays well 2-4.  Very enjoyable.

Ed:  I think this works best with 2.  With more, if one player is close to winning, each expects the other to stop him.  Either the last in the order must do it, or the game is over.

Victory is by building 30 which requires 1) efficient use of build phases and 2) luck of the draw. Victory by connection usually indicates poor play. 3 and 4 player games can be frustrating if an opponent connects because another opponent doesn't block - but that's still an indication of poor play, just not on your part. Which is why this game shines with 2 players.

RATING: 6
This is the first game that I claim to be "overrated."

In my two-player game, there was a lack of tension and no real feel of urgency and very little player iteraction.

This game seems to require a small amount of cognitivie thought as it is basically: draw, play, draw, play.  And I felt as though I won because I drew my tiles in a better sequence than my opponent.

If you want the exact opposite (in a 2-player game), that is, a game with interaction, strategy, and tension, stick with YINSH or Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation, or Carcassonne: The Castle.

I'm not saying this isn't a good game, it's just not gamey enough, didn't require much thought.

I KNEW I was going to win in two rounds, it's that kind of game.  You can openly see who's going to win because all of the game components are in plain sight, with the exception of the resource cards which are used to pay for the buildings, but with a 2:1 trade ratio on your resource cards, you can still get an idea of whether or not they'll be able to construct their buildings.  And "multiple" victory conditions, puh-lease.  It's nice to know that they are there, but your 2-player opponent would have to be passed out in order for you to connect your shrine with theirs, though I did try.  It adds a nice defensive mechanic, and you will attempt it (just for fun, since it is about the only hard part in the game), otherwise it's just a race.  Now that I think about it, the shrine-to-shrine race is the only tension in the whole game; the build all 30 buildings race is boring.


And when I did win, it didn't feel like a big deal.  I didn't feel like I over came overwhelming odds like LOTR: Confrontation, I felt like a runaway leader without built in controls like YINSH's remove a disk when you score mechanism, and I didn't feel like there was any way my opponent could win without the tally up at the end scoring of Carcassonne: The Castle.

A colorful, easy to learn, anti-climatic, low player interaction, solid game.  If my brain was really tired from a long day of work, and I felt like playing a game that plays itself, this one would be an ideal choice.  With that said, I will keep it since it plays well for 2-4 brain-dead players.

Great 2 player game.  With more than that, it may drag out, due to the difficulty of connecting temples.  Not the easiest game to teach, but once everyone understands the free build mechanics, this game goes quickly.  Great game for the wife and I.

RATING: 3
Beautiful production.

Lot's of mechanisms add little to the simple game concept here.  Repetetive game of racing to place tiles and annoying your opponent.

Blocking your opponent offers little advantage, because it puts you at a disadvantage as well by adding a card cost for an additional settlement. 

No conflict.  No player interaction.  No tough decisions.  No 'WOW' factor.

First played at Flatcon '07

Better than I thought it would be, but not one I would buy.  Too much like a glorified version of hex or something like that where you try and make a straight line between to points before the other players, which can ultimately diminish the strategic flavor of the game.

Quality rating: 6
Willingness to play rating: 6
Fun rating: 7

On some levels this is simply a glorified dexterity game where you're trying to fit things on the board in a certain way or connect two points before the other players.

Tile layer mixed with resource collection. Sort of a cross between Carcassonne and Catan.  Well designed and interesting.  What holds it back from being rated higher for me is that the games we played tended to be more about playing proper defense against your opponent than actually building to win.

RATING: 7
This is almost 2 games- a taut, tense, suspenseful 2-player game, or a too-chaotic, too-many-things-to-watch multiplayer game with a high risk of someone being forced to take a bullet for everyone else just to keep the game going. My wife and I have played this as a 2-player nearly 2 dozen times, and it is invariably a close game, with either player having a chance to win until the last 1-3 turns. There is enormous satisfaction to be found in stringing together a series of effective builds. You are somewhat at the mercy of the tile draws, but it would take a seriously bad draw sequence to make a game unwinnable. I don't ever want to play a 4-player round of this again, but am happy to take it out for a 2-player session anytime.

Excellent two player game.  Any more than two players and you have the "collective responsibility" problem.

This game is more than good. In my opininon when you play in 2 players version its something like light logical game, but when 4 players plays then it have more chaos (all players can change a map) - then its lighter.

I will admit that I wasn't impressed at first, but now it's one of my favourite games. I strongly urge anyone who has put it to the curb after only a play or two to dust off the amphoras and give it another chance. It's one of those rare games where the luck of the draw is a welcome part of the strategy. I can't say enough good things about this game. I know that I'll be playing it for a long time to come.

I've enjoyed this game a good deal, as gameplay can remain engaging while trading off between expediency and efficiency, but I haven't played as often recently.  I do not like the idea of forcing the next-to-last player to stop an imminent win, since it's generally detrimental to his play.  Fortunately, this situation doesn't usually spoil the game.

I use glass markers to show purchased buildings, which helps people track each other's progress.

Attika is probably my favorite German style game at the moment.  The game play is fresh, strategy is amazing, planning is key, and you can have fun screwing over the other player(s).

The whole strategy of the game is just to get some series of buildings that would allow you to build them all at once in order to reach somewhere fast or block somebody. So the buildings theme is just pasted on the game, buildings has no special abilities. The game is also a visual mess. It's hard to know which buildings have been played and are still availlable on other player's and you sheet.

Recieved via Secret Santa!  I'm not sure why people compare this game to Settlers; very little similarity in gameplay with no trading.  Sure you use resources to build, but that is a different process as well.  Good game, but really got to watch the free building process...

Great with two players. With 3 or 4, still a solid game but there is a bit of expectation that each person watches the person that goes after them to prevent auto win conditions, etc.

Though this game seems very straight forward - connect two temples with your pieces - it can turn into a vicious race to get all your pieces on the board and block one another...especially when you start putting them down for no cost!

I really enjoyed my one play of this game, but... I lost to what was essentially a kingmaking decision - i.e. the player before me could have blocked me or the player after me, and chose me, giving the other player the win. Ironically, it was unlikely I could have won anyways since I didn't have enough resource cards to place the final connecting tile, but that was enough of a taste to make me rate it as I did.

This game has generally left me flat. One good thing is that it is short enough to do two rounds right after one another.

Here are my issues.
- The winning condition of connecting two temples seems overpowered. I've won every game I've played by connecting two temples.
- The two actions are "build" or "draw". Except that you can build during the draw action. This is really annoying to teach new players.
- Explaining how you draw cards is also like pulling teeth.
- The amphoras seem like an afterthought. In fact, we tend to forget about them.

Given the complaints above, it really sounds like I hate the game. This is not true. Instead I am indifferent towards it. I have won every game played. Not one of these victories has been very satisfying.

Played only on BSW.

A decent game with some interesting ideas, but the randomness is pretty significant, and, while necessary to the current design, prevents the game from really taking flight.

UPDATE: I haven't played in ages, and don't really consider playing it. It obviously hasn't grabbed my imagination :)

Dropped to 5.

Mar 2005, bought from Thoughthammer.
First play impression: Don't know what to say about this game. It is ok....but the individual boardgame is too 'messy'. We have to search a while for the place to put the tile. And on the main board, the tiles are all there, we have to spend some time to search for the tile we need. I feel that more players, the situations will be more chaotic. However, this is just my first play. I will play more. Maybe then I will get use to the board and the gameplay will be more fluently.

I rarely pay resources for anything...the game s great with any number of players, though there is a subtle formula that you can play this game by to win. The only mitigating factor is the luck of the draw in the tiles.

RATING: 5
A bit of a disappointment. The game mechanics are pretty good, but the board has a few problems. Tile groups should be colour-coded, and the blue and green tiles are too similar. The game is a lot easier to play if you use counters to mark off which tiles have already been played.

RATING: 7
The theme of the game is rather implausible but the game play is pleasing.  A good bit of luck in how your tiles reveal themselves (especially since the right tile at the right time is free, but in the opposite order become expensive to play).  Also some doubt about the multi-player version, in which the necessity of blocking an opponent about to win hinders both of those players, leaving those not involved in a better position, so occasionally players will opt not to block and leave it to the last player - and occasionally that player cannot so giving an anticlimatic victory.  But as a 2 player game, with this issue removed,  find it an entertaining game.  Not too deep, but diverting.

I have rated this a 6 but it can go higher because as of this writing I have only two plays.  This game is a deep game and there is more to it than meets the eye.

One of the real plus points in this game is the fact that you can usually see exactly where you went wrong, and in my case I always want to play again, better this time.  The luck factor doesn't bother me; if I lose due to a particularly lucky tile draw by my opponent it doesn't matter; if I lose due to a poor decision then it does!  Haven't had the opportunity to play it enough to for it to get stale.

Though ostensibly an ultra-light civ building game, Attkia is almost an abstract. It's got good quality components, and the style of muted, conservative artwork that has come to be typical of Euros from the '00s.

Gameplay can at times feel like it wants to be longer, which is my way of saying that sometimes it feels like it's all over too quickly. This may be a symptom of playing with 2 players (the only way I've played so far), where a move is likely to either help you or hinder your opponent, but not both. With 3 or 4 players, I expect things become less clear cut, and there would likely be a bit more backing and forthing.

RATING: 9
Played a few times including BSW and actual game, with both 2 and 4 

It is true that you are often faced with the decision of preventing a win and crippling yourself significantly, often making it improbable that you can win.  You just have to make those decisions and try talking other people into stepping in now and then as well.  If you all play the martyr equally it works out.  If everyone is leaving it up to you, you're basically deciding if you should let opponent "a" win now, or make the game last longer and probably give the game to opponent "b" or "c".  With the second scenario there is that slim chance you can still pull it off, so people usually do that. I really like this one.  It's satisfying to work on your own empire-building and progress, even if you don't ultimately win the game.

UPDATE: raised from 8 to 9 after more plays.  Love this game and looking forward to adding it to my collection.

This is my favorite amphora game.

Attika has been on my playlist since it came out. This has the best elements of Settlers and Carcassonne yet feels completely different than either. You feel the ramifications of every move you make for turns to come - including the 1st one!!  I "get" the strategy behind this game. This is not about placing every tile you draw on the board if you can pay for it, this is about economics! 

Typically, you'll want to place a tile on the board immediately IF:

1. It can be placed but doesn't screw you out of completing a series of tiles for the amphora because it's out of sequence.

2. It can be placed on the board for free or at most a single card.

Otherwise it is probably wiser to place it on the city mat. You want to be very efficient with your resource cards so if to place it immediately it costs you 2 cards, you still have to spend ANOTHER turn to replace those cards. It's often better to put it on the mat and build things in sequence and for very cheap! (That's my strategy in a nutshell!)

For some reason, I tend to do really well at this game too, with a win percentage of about 65% mostly in 4 player games. This, of course, is not due to any spectacular play on my part, but more from the fact the the people I play it with reeaaally suck at it!

I bumped this up to a 10 as I will never turn down a game of it and I find it very enjoyable with every playing. Go and buy this now.

Downgraded to a 9. Don't get me wrong, I still love Attika, but I'm just not singing it's praises as much as the other 10's in my collection. It's really now an "almost" 10 - still fantastic, but just not quite as enthralling as it once was.

Has similar resources to Settlers, but doesn't grab me the same way.  The art is a but dull IMHO.
Some prefer Kizia's Durch die Wüste.
The four resources remind you of Settlers, but nothing else does.

4 / 5 - Very Good.

This is an excellent game involving resource management with a tasty side helping of aggressive and defensive play. It's fairly simple but all the rules slot together nicely to create a situation of an immense number of options, as they do in so many good Euros. What sets this apart is the focus on shallow but demanding tactical play and the opportunity for some conflict. See my review for more details: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/166989

It looks, from the bits and rulebook, FAR more complicated than it is. I had to convince my Significant Other to stick with it while we were trying to figure out the rules. She did, and just about snuck a completed route in on me! It is easier to grasp that it appears once you start. Its a wonderful gateway game, and best for two. Once this one is down, you can move on to other tile placement.. exploration... area control games. But, for two, expect to come back here frequently. Good enough not to get old. Use glass counters to mark off what buildings you've already place on your mats -- it makes things much easier.

This is an alright area control game that scales well from 2-4 players.  The game was designed well with two winning conditions, which protects it from the dreaded stalemate that will happen quite often for a game of balanced players.  The only odd part of the game for me is the additional tile segment placement procedure.  The way the rules are written, it seems to prevent some creative/break-out strategies.  A good game but kind of sluggish.

Update : Maybe it's the fact that this game is very simplistic, but it loose a little bit of fun after several plays. Still a very fine game but not worth a 9 anymore.

Good at 2, 3 and 4 players.

One of the most abstract, themeless game I have ever played. Not a horrible game, just nothing to do with the theme.

Call it "Virus" instead & make the game a biological domination game & the same mechanics would suit the theme then much better.

There is 1 aspect of the game that I really like though & that is, there is no "playing for place", there is only the winner & everyone else loses (this does not make me want to rate it any higher though, the theme is poorly tacked on.)

RATING: 5.5
I can forgive downward trend, to some extent, but this game suffers from a severe strain of it. The first few games are fun, but the game loses steam not over weeks, but within an evening. It's well-designed enough to merit a 5.5, but it's not something I would buy. 

It's unbalanced: the "settlement tax" is way too low, and the ability to form disconnected components (in the "B" game of playing all one's tiles, which sets in if no player can connect two monuments) is utterly broken.

Like it very much - sometimes luck plays a bit too large of a role, and it is somewhat hard to balance the game in the very opening. But, on the plus side, the game is quite clever with a lot of nice tactical and strategic finesse, and often awards extremely agressive play!

I like this a lot but substantially prefer it with the following variant, when playing with more than 2:  Instead of connection causing a win, it allows the connector to draw 6 cards.  This creates a more consistent overall feel for the game, to me.

I really like the way it combines tactical placement of tiles with the pressure to build vs. holding back to get free builds.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I really like the concept and the idea of it, but unfortunately the game doesn't quite work with me. The game is pure maximisation, and in fact would be a solitaire game if the board wasn't so small (and despite the board size, it almost is solitaire). The maximisation process is hampered by a severe random element (the tiles to be built are drawn randomly, as are the ressources... and with a lesser impact, so is the board itself). Now, some randomness is necessary in a maximisation game, or else it would simply become straight-up chess -- but with Attika, the random element is pushed too far.  

Plus, I tend not to like min-max games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The verdicts still out on this one.  There is luck involved from the tile draw but I felt it's a game of positioning yourself to take advantage of good tile draws ("buildings" you need).  I felt a lot of tension, which is a good thing, as it's ultimately a game of nickels & dimes, a bad or costly placement here or there (keep in mind you can never move any of the buildings once placed) and you'll lose the game against a worthy opponent.

The 3-4 player game can be frustrating if you need to place in poor spots in order to defend while others watch instead of helping.  So far, best as a two player.  Perhaps providing a bonus in the multi-player game, when 2 shrines are connected, rather than an outright victory would fix this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
After the intitial introduction to the rules (which might require more time than usual for this type of game), turn progression goes by fairly smoothly.  Like the balance between drawing and building, although it seems that it might get old fast.  Resource management through cost of buildings is always nice, as is the option to go all-out for two win conditions (connecting shrines and building all spots).

RATING: 6
It's a good game, but it's just a race propelled by randomly-drawn resource cards. The connection aspect is odd, because the players' goals aren't mutually exclusive, as in a more abstract game like Hex. So aggression is rewarded (note: I'm saying this as a negative). Probably best with two; with three you don't want to get into the problem of two players busy blocking each other while Brooke wins.

Simple and good game. The game is a lot about timing your actions. With experienced players it´s more of a race game to get rid of the tiles because it is seldom that someone can connect the sanctuaries. Very exciting game, even after a lot of plays.

RATING: 7
Great two player with a nice blend of simplicity with decisions.  Can be taught in 5 minutes.  Excellent rulebook, nice pieces and well done storage in the box.

Works best as a two player game because you can play a best out of 3 match in under an hour which helps curb a possible lucky start draw.  Nice confrontation element.

Sold.  I'm in the minority here but I actually prefer Aquadukt for this type of game.

I so desperately wanted to like this game as the rules and recommendations make it sound very interesting. However, there is just something lacking. It is too easy to build structures and if you don't engage in blocking tactics, it is merely a race across the board, especially with favorable landscape tiles. I'm thinking about a few house rules to make it more challenging. With a few modifications/house rules, I would rate this a 7.5-8
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
A most excellent tile-laying game.  Players all start with an identical set of tiles, and during the game attempt to either connect two temples with an unbroken line of tiles or place all their tiles on the board.

Each tile requires a specific set of resources to place on the board.  These resources can obtained by placing a tile adjacent to them on the board or payed for by cards.  Additionally, the tiles are broken up into sets; in each set of tiles the tiles are linked together in an order.  If a player can link the tiles together in this order on the board, they can build them for free. 

Adding more interest, most tiles start out upside down in front of the player.  Players can either choose two of the upside-down tiles (either building them on the board or putting them face up in front of them) or they can choose three of the face-up tiles (but they can't mix these).  This leads to very stressful choices.

This game has elegantly simple rules which lead to a complex game system full of stress and fun.

This is a good strategic civilization/building type tile placement game that has players either trying to build all their buildings or connecting two shrines. The instructions and mechanics are very simple yet lead to much deeper strategy. The board starts of fairly small so the game moves at a fast rate. The player-on-player interaction is limited in trying to block the other player’s progress while trying to build your own civilization. A really solid and good game that’s easy to pick up and play. Recommended!

The only problem with this game: for a new player, there's a problem correlating the stuff on the board with the stuff you have yet to play. Could be solved with additional markers (bingo chips) to cover the spaces on your board that you have already played. Should have been included in the game, really, but perhaps multiple plays desensitizes you to this.

Addendum: yes, bingo chips are a big, big help with this game.

Attika is a nice euro-style gateway game. I use it to get potential players to have a go at boardgaming, and it definitely works in most cases. There is some "luck of the draw" element involved, but gameplay is still strategic - trying to hinder your opponents and building your own city-state requires a lot of consideration in terms of resource management, optimal building placement and comboing. There is also a bit of kingmaking, but oh well - it isn't a huge issue. All in all, Attika is one of my most played Eurogames.

I find this game addicting. It's a bit like Ticket to Ride with Bob the Builder. It's much deeper than TTR and has nothing to do with trains, but the gameplay in both games hinge on collecting groups of cards in order to acheive goals. Attika has more strategy and replayability.

Sounds like it scales well and plays quickly.

Each turn draw 2 tiles to build or place on your mat or build 3 tiles from your mat. You can draw cards instead of the above actions. Building rules are generally favorable and there are multiple bonuses to encourage building. You win by building all 30 buildings or connecting the 2 temples.

Nice medium weight game that would work well for us.

As written [i.e. temple victory], probably a 5.5. With a good temple variant, maybe a 7.

I like the threat of a "premature" victory condition, [i]a la[/i] Taluva, but it's [i]too[/i] threatening.

Taluva is timed well, with both victory conditions becoming increasingly imminent during the game.

Attika, as written, is very front-loaded, and then bogs down once you block off the first few temple threats.

A simple and elegant game. The rules are so simple that they could easily fit on one A4 sheet, and the core rules fit on the player's mat. Easy to set up quickly and doesn't take up a lot of playing space. Nice artwork makes the game easy to look at and make decisions. My only recommendations is to use some sort of coloured marker to show on the player mat which buildings have already been played.  Good for 2 players, so-so for 3, not so good for 4. The random element is not out of control but there is enough uncertainty to force your strategy to be flexible. My wife, who is a very casual game but found Carcassone a bit boring, found Attika to be a bit dull.  For some reason, no one I know seems to want to play this game, possibly because its quite dry.

I'm weak for simple area control mechanisms and yet I missed this little gem. Attika mixes area control, hand management, city building and modular board to create a game full of tension and surprises.

Place your buildings on the board to carve out a territory for yourself and grab the best resources. Manage your geographical cards to keep your expansion options open. Manage your city-state to take advantage of free buildings (when building in the right order) and extra actions (when completing a group of buildings). Not enough space? Then time your depletion of tokens to place new area tiles.

I have only scratched the surface of this simple yet deep game and look forward to many more games.

Update: Sold because I feared that the luck of draw was too decisive and I haven't been able to get it to the table enough to refute this.

It's the game we play most often.

I love the balance/fight between trying to  make the connection between two shrines vs  trying to lay all your cards.

It's one of those games where I sometimes and my wife wins other times. I guess that's why we both are so willing to replay.

Good light-mid weight 2P game. Combines city building, tile laying, and spatial aspect of the board. At its core it is a game of efficiency but always with an eye to completing or defending against a quick strike of connecting the oracles (kind of like shooting the moon in hearts). 1-3-13

My rating for Attika has increased the more I've played it, and that's a very good sign.  I bought Attika as a two-player game primarily, as I'd heard that it was the best way to play it.  But the fact is that I prefer it with more players because the temple connections are easier and more of a threat.  When that is the case, the games move more quickly and are more fun.

There are still some issues with players being forced to make moves to stop someone else from winning, and who has to do this, but the game plays pretty quickly so I can forgive these small issues.  If the game draws on too long, it can get a little old, but I am very pleasantly surprised at how I've warmed to this, and that bodes very well for the future.

RATING: 8.5

I find Attika extremely rewarding. It's a race to build all of your tiles with an alternate victory condition that lets the trailing player try for a shortcut. Great implementation of controlled randomness in having to form a strategy to handle randomly drawn tiles.

RATING: 7
In ancient Greece, players put buildings on the mapboard where the  cost is paid by terrain or cards in hand. The player mat serves as a temporary holding area for buildings. Bonus turns can be earned if buildings are constructed in a group. First person to put all 30 buildings on the map, or connect two temples is the winner. Some tactics, some being opportunistic to find more space for your buildings while interacting with encroaching opponents. A couple of times, I have seen players accuse each other of not sacrificing themselves to prevent someone from connecting a temple. A little bit of luck depending which of your buildings you draw and in which order. Fairly hyped game from Essen 2003, but it is decent.

Area control and route building. a little bit of card resourse allocation, and you get a pretty decent gamer version of TTR.  OTher than the fact you only draw on your own resources to build, and you build the board, and there are resources, well, OK maybe not that similar, but simple rules and difficult decisions.  Looking forward to more playings to refine my rating.

RATING: 6
I found my first game interesting, but I'll need a few more plays to form a solid opinion. It may turn out to be more strategic than my first impression leads me to think, though as of now I see the luck of the draw (getting the earlier tiles in a sequence and/or drawing tiles in the same set to eliminate building costs) being a pretty big factor. One big negative for me was the difficulty in seeing what was already built and in play against what was still in the draw stack. ***UPDATE 6/18/04*** I don't think I'll ever really love this game, but I had the chance to play it with 2 and I liked it better than with more. It still feels a little random, though.

RATING: 7
I think it's a fun game.  One member of my gaming group thought it was too dry.  Another thought that all you had to do was collect all of the buildings first and then build for free while people like me struggle.  There's strategy here but I think it needs more.

Two player is excellent with the rules as is.  With 3 or 4 use the variant where a temple connection nets 3 amphorae rather than being an auto-win.

-----update----
Downgraded to a 7, but only because other things hit the table more often.  This one is very solid and won't go below a 7 rating for me.  Forget what I said above about getting rid of the instant-win.  Not necessary unless the players aren't keen about it.

--update--

Back up to an 8...it's really quite fun and the fact that it doesn't hit the table more often just means I need to get it to the table more often - not anything against the game itself.

This is a good one . . ..  I think its focus on building tempers the emotions of a game that is otherwise a cut thoart, cut 'em off, end run 'em, kind of game.  I think I'd like to see more historical information applied to the game and game pieces, but that's just my own preference, and not a comment on the game or game play.  I wonder a little about the replay value if groups are mixed (i.e. new and old) as I think the turn length of expeirenced players could drop to under a minute, where new players might drag for several minutes.  I think having an experience group who can all take fast turn would make this thing a blast . . .

While the randomness of drawing building can be frustrating, the rest of the game has enough planning to balance. Using the board spaces efficiently is vital. It's important to realize that there is a balance between taking the most optimal move from a resource standpoint and making moves that will hinder your opponent's progress. Blocking is important unless you want someone to sneak into a victory. There is still a fair amount of luck involved from the tile pulls, but there is still a fair amount of strategy involved.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.3
It has all the looks of a classic, with a box cover that evokes the games from 15 years ago. Still, it the art doesn't feel old at all. The components are just average.

The rules are very easy to learn and teach, and the gameplay is fluid, but there's not much to do in the time between turns, that's the reason people recommends it as a 2 or 3-player game (this, and the blocking resposibility).

Within these simple rules there are a lot of decisions to make, beyond the most evident ones: Should I build now, or shall I reserve the free builds for an important move? Etc.

Strategy, tactic and luck. But you need adaptability because the situation will change. The game flow is fast, and the game don't last long; the should last less than the advertised 1 hour, much less if you take the short route.

RATING: 8
Playing Attika has a feeling of building your empire even if it is really an abstract. The game has enough "theme" that it doesn't feel too abstract to me. Playing is mostly about optimizing your own resources and making it hard for other(s) to do it but 'Connect two shrines' -sudden death ending condition makes gameplay interesting. Because of it game isn't just minimizing your building expences. Unfortunately this also makes 3 and 4 players games a bit uninteresting if every player isn't on the same level. Then game can easily be decided if less experienced player isn't aware opponent's chances to end the game (or takes unnecessary risks). This can lead into boring end of the game. Therefore Attika is best when played with 2 players.

Gioco bellino anche se ho l'impressione che renda meglio in 2, gioco veloce (circa 30'), semplice ma non privo di strategia. Gioco di piazzamento, può ricordare un po' Samurai o Terra Nova, anche se l'interazione è meno presente; basta infatti controllare minimamente l'avversario per poi seguire con la propria strategia. In 3 o 4 giocatori c'è il rischio che ostacolare il leader provochi indebolimento lasciando troppo spazio agli 'spettatori'. Il gioco premia chi peova a costruire la via giusta (tra i due templi), piuttosto che chi cerca di distruggere. Molte partite si concludono senza collegamento ma solo con la conclusione delle proprie tessere da piazzare.

RATING: 6
Lovely and original modular gameboard tiles are really just the surface of this one. There's plenty going on with two- and three-player games, although four-player doesn't quite add up. The way the game divides itself into little sub-problems is engaging and makes less of a cerebral challenge than at first sight. Sadly the repeatability quotient isn't high: successive games will just not have sufficient difference to be remembered in the long run.

Further Thoughts - As I suspected, Attika is becoming somewhat monotonous in that all games are playing out exactly the same way. Downgraded from a 7 to a 6.

This one of my favorite 2p games. It's a fantastic little hand management, territorial tile-laying game with a Hex-like threat of connection. Despite the superficially random surface elements, the better player almost always wins.

Fun 2-player game. Have not played with more, yet. Got this as my 2006 Secret Santa gift!

RATING: 7
A good game, probably best with 2.

The positives:
Easy to teach and quick to learn, reasonably fast to play. There is a nice mix of luck and of strategy, and there is plenty to do between turns. The components are good* and the rules are well presented.

The negatives:
It suffers "Kill Dr Lucky Syndrome": players are obligated to prevent the person following them from winning. If a player is inattentive or less experienced they will easily hand the game to the person after them. This can be intimidating to newbies and frustrating to the other players, it can also lead to table-talk and consequent unhappiness.

Colourblind note: the red and green tokens were indistinguishable for me - I have added 5mm self-adhesive stars to the red counters and it's fine.

Ever play Hex?  This is Euro Hex.  But it's fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I think this is an outstanding design, a tile-laying, area control game that's obviously been well thought-out and thoroughly play-tested. A classic Euro--easy to learn, relatively few rules, lots of decisions to make but not overwhelmingly so, and no player elimination. 

The first player to connect his buildings successively between two temples,or, much more likely, to complete the construction of all 30 of his buildings, wins. 

Game plays can be very tense to the finish. Also, the production by Rio Grande is very attractive and the components are well made. 

The play of tiles generates changing terrain factors that can help or hinder building. It also matters in what order buildings are placed, because if done in the correct order it can be done without cost (in cards played) or even create extra free play turns. 

As advertised, "Attika" can be played in about an hour, although time can vary depending on how quickly players decide to move--figure more time for additional players. 

The only thing that holds me back about playing this more often is that it's fairly abstract, and therefore, in my book, a bit dry. But when I feel like playing a more contemplative game, this does the trick. The only reason I don't rate it higher is because I don't play it more often, which tells me something.

This is a really great quick and strategic week night game for 2-4! It's an area control game that's simple to learn, teach, play and remember the rules! It's fun to collect your tiles on your mat...but the real battle happens on the modular board which grows as you play! You may play up to 3 tiles on the board per turn...but you must pay for them with your resource cards! I'm not sure why this game is so much fun or why it's so good...other than the mechanics balance and fit so well together it keeps you coming back for more!

I like the weight of this game very much.  Two options for victory.  Two options for actions each turn.  I like the free resources that out on the landscape tiles.  And the mechanic that is unique to this game: building tiles for free if you can chain them correctly, is really really good!  So you have to time things just right in order to really maximize your actions.  But if you wait too long, you give your opponent some advantage.  Terrific!

Not much to this game. You draw tiles and then build them. There is a degree of luck based on the fact that if you draw the right tile (by chance) you can place it for free. Blocking is key as you can prevent your opponent from getting free placements and making a complete connection (a winning condition) but it may also be costly to you. The theme is also not really present at all in the mechanics.

I would rate this as a lightish game that takes no more than an hour to play and less if the people involved are experienced players. The mechanics for building are somewhat akin to that of Settlers except that there is no trading to be done and cost are all stated on the building tiles. What is interesting is the placement of the buildings so that it would effectively cut another player off from reaching the next shrine. Thankfully there are ways around that problem as once a player finishes a building stack, they would be able to expand the current map by placing another map tile down. To me, I think this game is highly suitable for 2 players.

I like this game so far (1 play), it works well with 2p.  My wife really likes it as well, it has enough in common with Catan (her favorite game) so that it should hit the table quite a bit once we get some more free time as opposed to playing the 2p variant of Settlers.

I enjoyed the resource handling of this game. That means that you may build a building if you have the correct resources or the board has correct resources. Another way of building is to build connecting (there are connections between some buildings) buildings next to the previous one without any cost. 

It also feels that you will get enough to do on your turn and mostly you'll be able to plan your next turn while waiting, you may for example think what you may do if certain buildings come up from the face-down pile.

Very fun combination of positioning, efficiency, and yes, theme. Have played only 2P and enjoy it immensely. Very useful to obtain some glass stones for marking constructed buildings on the player mat. As we've played more, I've seen fewer and fewer games end by connection - it ends up operating more as a threat to force suboptimal moves.

Fairly straightforward tile placement.  Setting aside luck of the draw, there do not seem to be any particularly interesting moments other than whether you should place now or wait, hoping for the right structure to come along and create a domino effect.  I suppose additional elements would come in to play if one were interested in purposefully blocking other players from paths or resources.  But I would rather have a competition of wits on an equal playing field than one of purposeful interference.

This is truly a great game for all the reasons that people givng it a ten have said. My only beef is that it is somewhat dry and abstract, It's design is better then Catan but its theme is more bland. the counters could be Greek cities, Pirate havens, English Gardens or Space colonies. Anything would fit the theme.
OK OK enough bashing of theme. This is a great thinking game that is easy, EASY to teach and 2 players are just as good as 4 players. Should have kicked New England out of "Game of the Year" slot. Newe England is twice as dry without the two player ability and ease of bringing new gamers on board. If you are a Euro-Game fan and you don't own it, you should.

A silent version of settlers, with the means to reduce building costs and make dramatic leaps forward to reach either one of the 2 winning conditions. Obviously lacks the socialisation, and the menu of goods needed to build is long and heady. We needed to mark on the player's mats which tiles were played, making it easy to assess.

This game SOUNDS like it would be fun, but it just seems pointless. Of the 2 winning conditions, connecting 2 temples seems like it would be impossible, unless there's a 1st time player at the table.  If you build in a certain order, your buildings are free; so if you are lucky, you win. 

Basically an abstract, with an incidental theme.

This is an ok game that relies heavily on flip luck, and has one big design problem. The general idea of the game is you build a semi-random board, and then players flip a few of their building tiles. The goal of the game is to be the first player to build all their buildings, and there's a cute technology chain where certain buildings when placed next to other buildings get built for free. The problem is to get more buildings, you flip them randomly. This is necessary otherwise there would be "best paths" though the game, but which building flips when is so important to the game, that it hurts the idea that strategy is involved in making your building choices. Not to mention, in order to prevent players from sort of carving out there own areas and not interacting with anyone, the game says there's an alternate way to win by connecting corners with a contiguous chain of your buildings. This is pointless, as there's no rule against having players start their buildings next to these corners, so blocking off corners is trivial to the point of making this rule useless. It's a nice idea for a game, but it just doesn't work.

Planning ahead is important, but your turns only consist of 2 or 3 actions so it's not too difficult to juggle everything.  If you make it to an end game with several "extra action markers" you could have to plan a 4-7  action turn all at once, which is a bit of a brain crunch in comparison to the rest of the game.  Don't let the resources fool you.  There's so much low-cost and no-cost building in this game it doesn't have the feel of a building game like Settlers.One can win by connecting their city from one temple to another.  This mechanic mostly serves to force one player to "bite the bullet" and block a player even if it's not their best turn to make (though, it could happen to be).  Overall, a fun, medium weight game with a few mechanics that don't quite fit my personal tastes.

Nice clean tile laying game. While there is a certain amount of luck based on the sequencing of tiles in the hidden stacks, this can be managed to a great degree by flushing out or reducing to a single tile one or two stacks. By the time you've flushed out a stack, the main board isn't too congested -- but it is getting very close to that point which is a sign of a well designed set of game mechanics.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Easy to learn, middle-weight game. Luck-of-the-draw of the gameboard tiles has the biggest effect on play. Otherwise most of the decisions seemed straightforward. It's necessary to build the 7 tile groups in sequence to take advantage of the free tile placement. Maintaining/limiting free space to allow this for yourself and inhibit it for opponents is critical to the endgame play unless victory is achieved through temple connection.  Can be played from 2 to 4 players. Temple connection should rarely happen if players watch out for large card hands and collected amphora; so it should be a 30 tile placement race.

Update: I was wrong, all the games have ended in temple to temple connections along the edges of the map using only half the pieces. Every player works their own edge and if any effort is made to block another player the result is both players will lose. A bigger map would help a lot.

Update 2: I've now seen a 30 tile winner due to the other 3 players (myself included) not setting up collection of free tiles, amphora, and card hands so that incremental additions were easily blocked. The 30 tile player didn't keep to a single connected area but maintained room for amphora-collecting expansion and free tile placements.

Primarily played this as a 2 or 3 player game. Can see why it is popular. 
It is generally a resource management/optimization, You do have to watch what you are doing versus the other to see who is ahead on the curve. I do think the shrine connection as an alternative victory gives an option if you are behind.
A lot of people complain about the shrine connection forcing a player to be a kingmaker. I view it as the lead players problem, if he does not block then he deserves to lose.
Will try this one again

To me, Attika is another good example of throwing lots and lots of mechanics into one big pile and making a game out of it that might work in terms of mechanics but is not more than the sum of its parts and I fail to see the overarching concept and ingenious 'designer's handwriting' behind the run-of-the-mill euro mechanics. The basic idea is not bad and almost sounds like a simplified checkers or chess version, a competitive abstract game but it is muddled up some inelegant rules and possible actions which prevents the game to flow and instead every turn feels like a damp squib. I am sure some people will like this game, but it did not hit a nerve with me.

This game was my downfall.

After some neighbors convinced us to play Catan and I learned that board games don't universally suck, I started talking about Catan at work. A coworker overheard me and convinced me to try out Attika with him. When I declared that I liked it and wouldn't mind owning a copy, he told me it was "out of print". That was the turning point in board gaming for me; that was the point when I should have walked away.

And that's exactly what I did. I was resolved to just let it go. Unfortunately, the next day he showed me that someone who lived not too far from me had a copy for sale on "BGG".

I've avoided social networking, blogs and the numerous other products being used to turn our lives into one big reality show, but I figured there was no harm in creating a BGG account just long enough to buy this game. I didn't even bother trying to come up with a clever username. When I went to pick up the game, the seller also gifted me a copy of Babel. Ok, now I own Attika, Babel, and Catan. That's a collection, right? I've got this neat new BGG account, I may as well add my collection to that site and keep my game thoughts on there. I won't start broadcasting my opinions or posting in threads. Just notes to self.

And then an FLGS had a big clearance sale to get rid of some OOP stock. I think I bought 12 games that day. It seemed absurd to own that many games. I kept them in a little pile of shame on the living room floor for a few days. I took a few of the games back, but the proprietor of the shop reminded me this was a sale of OOP games and some of these wouldn't be available again. That was the moment when my wife should have locked me in the closet while she burned every game in the house.

I took back Citadels after reading about how "mean" it was and how your spouse would throw things at you if you played it with her. Then we played that Babel game (against the dire warnings of the Eurowankers) and discovered that we *liked* throwing things at each other and I reacquired Citadels (along with one or two other games). Then the friend who introduced me to Attika started telling me about this Battleline game that was OOP (temporarily, it turns out) but was absolutely fantastic. Calling around, I found a copy and we loved it so much we went on a quest to find more games like it. We never did manage to find another game that inspired such agony and delight in such a small simple package, but along the way we discovered many other things we loved. That was also the first year I didn't replant my garden.

I discovered (or reaffirmed) that I am a completionist and a collector. I confirmed that I have a strong fear of missing out and a weakness for limited time offers. I've known these things for years and have done what little I could to keep my data out of the greedy hands of the marketing firms masquerading as product companies (e.g. Google, Facebook, WalMart). I knew that if I wanted to keep enjoying the simple timeless pleasures of life, I needed to stay away from anything that purposefully preyed upon people with my weaknesses. My garden will never need a product that will go out of print (except that Monsanto likes to buy up heirloom seed companies and "discontinue" them), but my garden does need my time; time I am instead wasting tracking down OOP games and individual cards pulled from boxes to sell as promos at inflated prices; time I waste "researching" (read: throwing money at) overproduced prototypes on Kickstarter (My latest rationalization: "My time is worth $XX/hr so it's cheaper to just buy the game than to spend time researching it"); time I waste trying to pile up shrink wrapped boxes against the wall when my bookshelves no longer have the space.

If I'd know what those first 12 games were going to turn into - if I had any inkling of how deeply I would fall into this trap - I never would have made this BGG account.

And perhaps the most telling part of it all is that I still have never played my copy of Attika.

RATING: 5
Tentative 7 after one play. Theme is very artificial since my dad couldn't care less for this game, which somewhat surprised me because I found gameplay lighter than expected. (He was also somewhat annoyed by all the small print all over the place.) This is more of a resource-management game than a tile-placement/connection game. (The rules encourage placing your tiles in clumps rather than scattered throughout the board, contrary to your typical connection game.) Not as interactive as I would like since it's a hassle to look at your opponent's mat to determine all of his or her possible plays.

UPDATE: Downgraded from a 7 to a 5. Too much bookkeeping for a relatively light game!

There's obviously strategy here, with resource management, board locations, tiles with different costs, etc - but it has an infuriating amount of luck thrown in which seems out of place in a game like this (to me).
The beginning tile draws vastly impact what you can build (and where). As the game progresses, it seems like the amphoras are so critical to winning (against evenly-matched skill players), but obtaining them is dependant on pulling the right tile to finish your section (completely luck-based) that it can be a game-stopper.
It was in my first game, where I drew early and often, more than anyone else, but never got the tile to finish any of the 3 of 4 areas I had set up and planned for.

I like the fact that you can build for free if you connect it to the right piece. This is another game that seems that the luck of the draw can be a large factor in how you do. You need a good strategy to utilize the resources as you play for the best results.

I feel like I'm playing the initial exploring part of Civilization the computer game.  I tend to play aggressive and block off as much territory as I can from my computer nemeses.  Attika plays the same way.  It's not much more than strategically trying to block and grab territory before your enemies/opponents have the chance to do the same.  I like it though.  There are a lot of decisions to make each turn.  Also, the game play is quick.

Fun, light but seemingly very luck-dependent.  There is skill, but drawing the right tiles and cards is more important.  Trying to set the pain threshold high enough for the other players so that they won't mess with your plans is the fun/skillful bit of the game for me. Pretty-much plays itself, but is still enjoyable.

I really like the way the mechanics connect in this game.  True there is a good bit of luck and a need to "take one for the team" to stop a runaway leader (which stops this from being a "10" for me), but irregardless I like the way this game's mechanics work.  Whenever I get the chance to play this, I have jumped at it - I really like the way this game plays out.

Nice game! Simple rules that even a 7 years old boy can understand. Much interaction due to the tightness of the board (at least with 2 players, but four seems to be even tighter!) Some luck (get to draw the right buildings and resource cards), but also enough planning ahead. And short enough to get to play a revanche (and then another one).

A non-flashy euro game that really packs at lot in a short easy to learn game.  Has elements of area control resouce management mixed with a technology type tree for you building civilization plus has multiple ways of winning.  Now the theme of building your city gets lost a bit but there is a lot going on in the this game and one really has to pay attention to you opponent to be sure they don't win with a quick strike by connect the shrines.  Good depp euro that can be basically picked up and played without having to relearn.

Only just a bit leery on this one. It has everything I seek in a simple euro--tight ruleset, quick turns, open-game space, non-points related victory goals, action selection choices. Is there further substance? More plays should be telling. Either way, it's more enjoyable than most of the tripe being fawned over these days. One thing struck me the most: it reminds me of Ticket to Ride, but instead of pre-defined "routes", you have an abstracted, open-ended game space. This I like!

I really like the "this-or-that" thing where you're trying to win by either building everything you have, or connecting the two shrines.  It's never a sure thing either way -- you might have to change strategies mid-game, or at least leave your options open.  And you have to defend against both possibilities, too.  Terrific!

A very neat game.  Probably best with 3.  With 4, you are too disconnected from some other players and you can find yourself having no influence on how fast they expand.

I dislike the chance of an early lucky break if you get your capitol right away on a board with a perfect spot for it.  I'm not sure how much that matters, but it's clearly a lucky break through no planning on your part.  Slightly reducing the early game luck surrounding drawing your main city could easily make this an 8/10.

I've played this game a few times, and each game has been a different experience for me. I like the interaction, and creating a shrine link (although unlikely to happen) is enough of a threat to move the game along. I think it's a necessary mechanic in encouraging a more interactive game.

I really enjoy this game partly because it plays so quickly - 3p can finish in under 30 min - and it works probably best as 3p. 4p is pretty good - 2p not so good).  It's just the right mix of a litte planning strategy (based on your starting pieces, what group are you going to go for), some luck of the draw, a good bit of push your luck hoping for the right draw, and a lot of tactics - some in the spatial element, but a lot more in the timing of when you draw tiles, build tiles, or draw cards.

--Jan2006-- Game is more interesting than I'd thought it was after a partial BSW play last year.

I don't like games where one person is forced to hurt their own position to stop another player from winning, often effectively kingmaking in the process.  However, when I played it with three players recently, rather than four, it didn't seem quite as kingmakery, so maybe it just doesn't work as well with 4.  It does have some nice ideas in it.

Plays best with 2. I know a lot of people complain about a connection victory being too powerful but I disagree. I think a great strategy is to set yourself up to be able to win in one turn and thus make your oppenent build inefficiently to block this. A great game.

Simple game that gives players a lot of varied choices about how they want to strategically approach it. More finesse than Through the Desert and other cut 'em off type games. I recommend using cubes (from another game) to keep track of your placed tiles on your player mat. Ultimately it comes down to having decent tactics and making the least mistakes. Few games get me as annoyed with myself as this one. Besides that I think it's probably a good game - it just drives me nuts.

RATING: 7
Resource management, tile placement, vision of space, area control and a race are mixed together in this very good game.  Its sin:  if people get into it and measure every move to achieve the best option, it can develop an analysis paralisis problem.  It is sure an abstract game, but the theme has been picked very well.  I rate it  a 7, but I believe it is the closest 7 to an 8 that I have played.  It is simple not that easy to say for a game that it is one that will never be turned down.

RATING: 8
Very interesting "make a path" game. The game board is composed of 2-4 interlocking hexes and an equal number of opposing shrines. (The exact number is equal to the number of players.) Make a path between any two of the shrines and win the game. If everyone is on their toes and players block each other properly, this doesn't happen, and the other victory condition kicks in (first to play all their buildings). Buildings cost resources to play, but this cost can be often mitigated (nearby on-board resources can be used to pay some or all of the cost) or eliminated (a "child" building can be freely played next to its parent; e.g., you may play a ship next to your harbor for free). Add to this an additional resource penalty for starting a new settlement (a settlement is any group of connected buildings) and a turn bonus when placing all the tiles in a familial group together and touching. (That's what the amphoras am for!) In practice it's very difficult to completely block out a shrine because each player has as many as four opportunities to add a hex tile and extend the map. I've played this as a 2-player and as a 3-player game, and it scaled very well. I can't see why it wouldn't scale to 4. Enjoyable.

I'm glad the fuss has died down on this game, because now I feel less obligated to love it.  The design is sound, the graphics enigmatically attractive... but I just don't feel the heart of the game.  Perhaps I just don't have the patience or mental energy for a game that practically demands this level of constant analysis.  That said, it is still enjoyable, and has a place in my collection.  Perhaps I'll enjoy it best as a 2-player game.
Addendum: I think now that I have a couple tries under my belt, I'm more comfortable with what the game is about.  And it's still way pretty.  +1!!

As a sucker for tableau-building games (such as Glen More and Race for the Galaxy and so on,) I immediately took to this game - even though it's more of an area control game I think. The allure of tableau-building games (for me) is that you produce your own little concoction at the end of the game - which you can admire and take pictures of and stroke affably. Much like the painting which is left on your plate after devouring a beet salad. It turns consumption into a creation somehow. Which is satisfying to the innately productive. The art is also beautiful here.

I do sense a weakness in this game, however, which only time will tell. I feel like its strategy is solvable. Obviously there is a strength given in the extra action bestowed by the "carrots". And obviously drawing tiles and laying them immediately gives an enormous advantage. So it seems the ideal strategy is to draw cards very early and then draw/lay tiles until you are depleted. Then draw cards again. Then deplete. (Never using the lay tiles action except to draw cards.) Then, on your last turn, plan it so you can run out all of your carrots at once, since by then you should know what's left in your piles and can be guaranteed a finish.

Now, the strategy on the board itself can wreck this - but if you look at it this way, the game becomes very similar to Ticket to Ride!! Draw cards, pay for route-building, back and forth. I like this better than TtR, but I feel there is an upper limit to my enjoyment here.

Still, a sweet game!

I really liked the fact that it is very fluid.  I'd definetly play it again.

A simple, tile-laying and resource game. Room for a lot of strategy and often feels like a race to the finish. Very satisfying when your plans play out the way you intended. However, having an absent-minded player let someone win by connecting temples can make 3 and 4 player games a real downer (assuming you aren't the victor). The variant where you are awarded 3 amphoras for connecting temples may be a solution to the problem just mentioned.

Excellent middleweight tile laying game. Players are trying to use landscape cards to build 30 buildings or connect their cities between two shrines. The landscape provides free resources and players get to build buildings free if they follow the technological tree.

Synopsis: Build everything as quickly as you can, but throw in extra random elements to make the game seem more strategic and challenging. Too lengthy - not meaty enough for the time it takes to play.

Attika is about civiliation building in the same sense as Through the Desert is about camel caravans. Overall, it's a good, medium-weight strategy game with a blend of skill and luck. It can be frustrating when people block you, or when you aren't drawing the tiles you want!

RATING: 7.5
One of the quintessentially German games: short and straightforward rules, nice components, implausible theme.  Resource management and difficult decisions.  Some luck of the draw but careful play is rewarded.  It scales beautifully from 2-4.  The box is one of the nicest since Tikal!

RATING: 10
Elegant, simple and well-structured empire building with interesting resource management issues.  Two very different different victory conditions neither of which are victory points or money!  I especially like how the board expands.  Addictive. Excellent three player game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Good looking and fun resource management game which scales well for different numbers of players. There is a lot to think about, but the system does a good job of restricting your choices, so the game goes quickly. Lucky tile draws help, but you can always mess with another player's plans if you are willing to incur the cost. In multi-player games, you are often called upon to sacrifice yourself to prevent another player from winning (which means that the uninvolved players benefit most) which can be a drag, and is why I prefer this as a 2-player game.

Learned through a friend at CPGC - was lucky enough to buy a new copy and teach Jen.  She really likes it, so woohoo there.  

I like the fact that no two games will play the same, but you can develop a strategy that may cross over game to game.

After 8-10 plays, I have to say that this is a good game, with some nice mechanisms and a good theme.  The gameplay can be tense and clever at times.  However, the bits could be better.  We purchased some chits to cover the player's board after building a building, this is helpful to see what is still required or what is in the stacks.  It would have been nice if something such as this had been included in the actual game.  In addition, different color accents for the varied groups would have made it much easier to track completed groups on the board.  This is currently rather difficult and annoying.<BR><BR>Another thing, the busy board and the occasionally seen analysis paralysis makes this game "sometimes kind of not really fun," as my son would say.  Good game, but not great.

A simple enough game and quick to play. I went to sleep during my first game of this one and lost easily to my opponent.
I'd like to play it again though and think it might be a quick strategic one I'd play a lot as a 2 player (it can take up to 4).

Mielőtt a megjegyzésemhez hozzákezdtem volna megnéztem kinek hány játéka van itt a BGG-n ezzel a játékkal és 100 fölötti számok röpködnek. Nem véletlenül. Ketten rögtön lenyomtunk vele 5 játékot. Tehát gyors játékról van szó, négyen biztosan hosszabb, de nem hiszem, hogy vészesen megnőne a játékidő. A másik dolog, hogy az egyik legtöbbet játszó felhasználó másik kiemelt játéka a Tigris és Eufrátesz és ha jobban belegondolok nagyon hasonló abban a két játék, hogy nagyon kellemes, de érzi az ember, hogy elég sokat számít a szerencse benne. A játékosok épületeket építenek és a folyton épülő pályán úgy próbálják lehelyezni őket, hogy minél kevesebb nyersanyagot kellejen kifizetniük közben. Ezt megtehetik úgy, hogy nyersanyaglelőhelyekre vagy melléjük teszik, illetve úgy, hogy egy fejlődési fát követve a korábbi épület mellé építik. Egyszerű szabályok, gyors játékmenet, többfajta stratégia. Ez utóbbi abból adódik, hogy egyrészt végfeltétel az összes épület lerakása, illetve a játék két legtávolabbi pontjának összekötése. Ez a két cél érdekes, mindig más játékot eredményez. Jó játék az Attika, bármikor kategória, de a szerencsefaktor miatt magas pontszámot elsőre semmiképp nem kap tőlem, illetve van egy olyan érzésem, hogy igazán csak ketten jó.

[2012-08-18]
Hárman egyértelműen fenn áll a veszélye, hogy aki beáldozza magát a másik összekötésének meggátolására, az időt veszít a harmadik féllel szemben. Négyen azért megnézném egyszer, de tipikus kettes játék. Ezen túl van benne nagyon egyértelmű stratégia így ezt játszva túl automatikus a játék és tulajdonképpen a jó lehelyezésen és főleg a szerencsén múlik a végkifejlet. Eggyel rontom a pontszámot, de ettől függetlenül tulajdonképpen bármikor jöhet kategória.

I haven't yet had the chance to play this as much as I'd like to, but it seems interesting. I suspect 3 players is the ideal number - with 2, there is little possibility of players blocking one another, with 4 it happens far too often.

RATING: 7
Perhaps a little long and not as interactive as I'd like, but I must say this is a classic example of an OK game.  I do get irritated with the three player game where the onus of stopping a player from winning will fall on the shoulders the middled player as the other player has the leisure to build as they will.  This pattern seems to crop up ever game.  Now I'll only play this with a two players, which isn't too much of an issue as I rarely want to play it.  That said, an occasional game (once or twice a year) with two players makes for a fun exercise in efficiency (with two it ranks a 7 for me, but is just too expensive to buy as a two player game).

UPDATE: I bumped this up to a 7 just because it works so well with 2.  If I pretend this is only a two player game my irritation disappears and I just get the good parts.

A terrific game that is getting better each time I play it (on BSW exclusively for now). The mechanics are pretty straightforward, such that newcomers can actually get into this game relatively easily. As you continue to play, some of its more elegant subtleties will emerge - the existence of specific building groups and how they play out strategically; the &quot;connecting shrines&quot; vs. &quot;30 building&quot; debate for completing a game. This game grows on you and the more it grows, the better it gets

RATING: 8
This is very much a gamer's game, and one that I think puts Casasola Merkle in the top rank of designers. Once again I am impressed with his ability to create a lot of play value with quite simple mechanisms. Unlike many tile-laying games, Attika has straightforward victory conditions, and I like that. I'd rate the game higher if it were a bit faster paced with > 2 players; also the building tiles really need colors or insignia to easily identify them by group. And despite being a very solid game, it somehow lacks the sparkle that makes you want to play it week after week.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
If the only way to win was to play all tiles, I'd send this off to the back of the closet, but I like that you can be sneaky about adding to the board for a "screw you, I'm gonna connect two shrines" victory, which probably only works against inexperienced players (but so what, it's fun). Edit: Bless Lisa's heart for continuing to play this with me... I'm now 19-1 against her. We usually level off in games, but not this one.

Surpising hit with the wife. Excellent combo of tile laying and resource allocation. Just the right amount of depth for a one hour game. Be aware that there is very much a race mechanic in this game, and you will very likely have to have one person take on the role of cutting off a certain victory from one player without optimizing your own play. You have to be very crafty to do this and win, but you can.

A very clever, pretty game with some neat mechanics that inspire you heavily where you go.  With repeated plays, I can see my rating advancing on this one.  Too bad it is so difficult to find.  If I had first played it in 2003, no doubt I would have initially rated it an 8 or higher.

I played this game a lot a while back, and played it again fairly recently. Back then I liked it, but didn't love it. Looking back I can't see what's not to love about it. After the recent play, I can see why I didn't love it. It just seemed abstract and for me that's a negative even though the theme is fine. Despite that, it's fairly quick and offers plenty of meaningful decisions. Perhaps it was a little abstract. I've upped my rating to remove this prejudice.

RATING: 8.5
I really like this one. At first I thought it too abstract, which I don't like, but it has really grown on me the more I play it. One thing I really love about it is the component quality and the graphic design. Everything is very easy to see and distinguish from everything else, the colors are great, the bits feel good in the hand, and it stores most excellently in the box insert - kudos to whomever was responsible for this! I get very tired of game bits that try to be so thematic that they seem cluttered with graphics or are just plain hard to interpret - none of that here. 

So, players all attempt to build a path of buildings that span from one end of the playing board to another, while blocking each others best efforts to do so. So, yes, there is always blocking in this game, which normally I think is a very uninspiring game mechanic (see Ticket to Ride...) but here it is so intrinsic to the game that you know it will be there almost every step of the way; it becomes more or less invisible to the nerves, like the ever-present ticking of a clock that one becomes desensitized to. There are other, more interesting mechanics in Attika (nothing ground-breaking, mind you) and it all works very smoothly and elegantly, chugging along at a very comfortable pace. As a matter of fact, as I write about this game I am feeling an unmistakable urge to play it - which is a very good sign. There is luck in how the building tiles are drawn, but to me this presents the exact amount of luck appropriate for this type of game, with this type of playing time, and this type of depth. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Played once.  It is rather dry (great example of multiplayer solitaire, which doesn't bother me at all), and the theme doesn't quite stick, but it's a challenging game with limited luck.  I'd recommend trying someone else's copy to make sure it appeals to you.  I enjoyed my one play, however, and would welcome a chance to play it again.

I really like the components and that the connection of multiple temples can be another way to win the game.  Plenty of player interaction and some interesting choices in deciding whether or not to use the buildings you have or draw new ones makes for a fun time.  Upon further play, this could move up to an 8.

UPDATE: Played a couple of more times and really enjoy the strategy involved in trying to stop the connection between the buildings.  Especially shines as a two-player.

Connection game with resource management. Attika is a good 2p tile-laying game with alternate victory conditions and simple-but-satisfying combo/chaining possibilities. Apparently it plays with up to four, but it seems made for two. The theme is meaningless and the components are unremarkable in that old euro way, but the rules are simple and there's a good amount of interaction. Luck of the draw is significant, probably too much for many euro gamers, but given the game's weight and playing time, it doesn't bother me. Underrated and worth seeking out.

Those were my first impressions. Subsequent plays have tempered my enthusiasm. Luck of the draw is more decisive than I'd like, and the alternate victory condition operates too rarely to create much tension. What's left is the admittedly enjoyable combo/chaining, but that's not enough to keep me requesting to play the game when there are so many great 2p games available. Consequently, this one seems destined to hover between a rating of 6 or 7.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
Excellent game. The straightforward rules and gameplay create a pleasurable & relaxing gaming experience that my wife & I like. Player interaction/confrontation is about the maximum that we will tolerate. Couple of component quality control niggles: The player mat tile overlap on the Harbour & Quarry graphics is annoying. The box insert section for the cards is too small (we had to 'fix' it). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Sold at auction.

Haven't played this one in a while. It's a bit more confrontational than my wife typically likes, but can occasionally get her to play.

I like the build tree that potentially provides free or reduced build costs and being able to string multiple actions together in that way. the spatial reasoning aspect of it is interesting too as we try to find a way across to the other temple while blocking the opponent from doing likewise.

RATING: 8
This is a fantatsic 2 player game.  I think it tends to breakdown with more players.  It's a subtle game too but one where blocking plays are an essential part of play.  Unfortunately, I have seen situations where some gamers (usually online) take offence at what they see as aggressive moves.

While it's sometimes possible to end the game by joining two temples most games do not go that way.  Once it becomes apparent that the temple route strategy has been scuttled the gamer becomes a carefull cat and mouse game of economical moves.  The tactics that can be employed here are manifold and vary a lot depending on the different groups building tiles. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Really good game! Clearly an abstract, with a pasted-on theme. But there's enough luck in it so it's not completely dry, but not too much - luck of the draw (tiles or resources) is largely manageable, and the better player will generally win. Also, a relatively fast game that moves at a nice pace. Best played either 2er or with all experienced players if playing with more (so everyone knows when to block someone else).

I had a chance to play this many years ago and immediately fell in love. That night I stopped at the FLGS on the way to a friend's house with my wife. Picked this up and introduced it that night. (With just the husband, my wife was even less of a gamer then.) I've continued to enjoy this, even with three and four, regardless of supposed problems. I burnt out on two player for a while after playing it repeated at lunch. After picking up Taluva, by the same designer, I felt an urge to bring this out again. My father-in-law, who I've completely converted to the land of designer games had not played it yet, so I trounced him twice just last week.

Attika is nice enough if you play with two. Somewhat inoffensive, nothing spectacular, but all-round pretty decent. With more, it has a huge stop-the-player-to-your-left-from-winning problem. If one player is about to win by connecting two temples, it is usually up to his right neighbour to prevent this. This provides the other players with a free turn, basically. Pretty nasty in an otherwise decent game. But even apart from that, I never found it interesting enough to keep in my collection for too long.

FANTASTIC with competitive players who won't just drop a tile down.  If the game is not taken lightly, it is short-term strategic, long-term tactical brilliance.  It is definitely possible to get a connection win with competitive players--if you don't think so, you're doing it wrong.  It's all about timing your stack depletions to allow the placement of the extra area tiles.  THATS what allows you to make connection wins.  Our wins are pretty evenly divided.

Which player will draw his tiles in the luckiest order?  This consideration overshadows all else, though there are better and worse ways to play whatever order you do draw them in.  Sometimes the luck of the draw is roughly even and you get a close contest.  The other important comment:  The cards are very pretty.

RATING: 6.5
[RGG 2003 Edition] {Greek, city building, couple; tile-laying, drafting, connection; optimal 2p} Attika is a good tactical Euro game with nice player interaction. It's a connection game where players have to optimize their moves. The game system is fairly simple and fairly fits the theme.

The bits are sturdy but markers should be provided to help players visualize placed buildings on the players' mat.  It is easier and faster to play Attika with makers.

Attika would be better if it allows players formulate a definite strategy. So far, I find this game tactical, instead of strategic, because it has a number of random factors - card draw, tile draw and building draw. Thus, players are usually forced to make tactical move. Nonetheless, players have certain control out of the draw - building draw can somehow be predicted, card draw can be mitigated with 2 cards combo, and a player can control the time of drawing new tile.

Some of my friends are complaining that the shire-connection winning condition is not working; however, I think its mere presence already affects the game plan and increases player interaction. When it comes to a point that a player is going to connect 2 shires, every other player will work to block his path. This increases tension and excitement of the game. Thus, this winning condition is important and has effects.

[Taluva] Taluva seems to be a similar game as Attika (in terms of depth and ways of thinking). It's more tactical, attractive and interactive. I would like to have a play.

RATING: 4
A game where you begin by primarily stopping your opponents from winning by connecting any temples.  Then evolves into as a race to place all 30 of your tiles.  Problem is sometimes you will find it impossible to block someone because you dont have the right resources.  Does it work? IMHO just barely.  The luck factor is probably too high, but if you place your tiles "right", you can prepare for virtually any draw.  The problem is placing your tiles "right" is sometimes confounded by your need to "block".

This game falls on the wrong side of the Great Eurogame Divide, which I'm becoming increasingly aware I have in my mind.  On the one side are the games where players are equally situated and have a very similar opportunity path at the beginning of the game (Caylus, PR) and on the other side are games where everyone has the same potential but only gets to see a bit of it at a time, thereby introducing a lot of luck into a game that doesn't have enough player interaction to iron that luck out.

Basically luck with little player interaction=bad.

Only played 3-player once, and want to try it a couple more times, though 3-player seems though that seems universally reviled on BGG forums.

Bit bland, but there are several paths to victory to pursue. Quite tricky to connect two temples though. Equally tricky to make sure someone other than you blocks another player who is about to connect two temples.
I like the gameplay overall, but there's too much blocking and having to "sacrifice" your own position for my taste.

Houserules: we like the variant where you get 3 amphora for connecting temples, instead of winning.

I finally got my hands on this HiG game after so long.  I found it to be easy and entertaining.  My wife liked it.  After four plays it really seemed it showed what it had to offer.  I think we were just starting to come upon some nice strategies for blocking and jerk moves but it really is a limited design.  Nice looking, clever but ultimately shallow.

Good! Simple and straight-forward, but with enough strategy to keep you sharp. Two paths to victory, and both can be tricky to pull off: either build your empire outward to connect 2 temples, or simply build everything there is to build! I've only played with 2 players so far, though.

Increased rating to a 9.  The more I play this game, the more I like it.

Update.  Have now played 25+ times.  Great as a 2 player game, much less so with more.  In the 2 player game, one player can make a serious mistake and lose the game.  With more players, one player can make a serious mistake and give the win to another player.  The other opponent(s) have no defense against this problem.  I will leave my rating as 2 player, as this is usually the only way that I will play.

9 - 2 player game
5 - 3 player game
3 - 4 player game

I picked up this one at TotalCon 2004. Found it hard to win by connecting shrines if played with good strategists (I don't think anybody has ever won that way). Good overall game with cool mechanics. Hmmm... do I build this turn or do I draw this turn?

An interesting game that starts as a race game and the key to winning is realising when winning the race (by connecting temples) is no longer possible and knowing when to make the game an efficiency game.

You can attack other people's efficiency engines by playing tiles to block where they can build for free, you can time when to add new terrain tiles to allow you to time when to make a mad rush for connecting temples and there are many other strategies and options in play.

29-Aug-08: Surprisingly short and fun! A lot of blocking strategies involved, and you tend to squint at the board a lot to determine if you can build something for free. Halfway through the game, I suddenly realised why people were using glass beads to keep track of built buildings on their player sheet. Finishes quickly, and with a modular board to ensure replayability, I think this will eventually find itself into my collection.

Something about this just doesn't do it for me. Which is odd since I like stuff that is similar to this. It might be a lack of scoring. I don't mind other games where I make the best out of what I randomly draw. I also think I have an issue with the theme. The best moves make be do things that I shouldn't be doing when building a city.

RATING: 7
Attika is a good game - it's very strategic, yet has a light amount of randomness that keeps each game fresh.  This is good with two players, but with more, one has to beware that when one player has a "winning move" on their next turn, it generally falls on the person right before them to make the blocking move that prevents it.

Upgraded to a 7 - not a big upgrade, but I've played this a few times with my group and it has gone over very well, even with more than 2 players.  The players just have to have the right mindset to play.

RATING: 8
As a two-player game, Attika is quite good. The tension between placing your own buildings and blocking your opponent's makes for a great, quick game. With more players, there is a kingmaker problem and you have less control (i.e., someone else's mistake can cost you the game). I once rated this game quite high. While I still enjoy it, experienced players make this less a game of connection, and more an exercise in building -- which removes much of the tension.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Attika is really fun for me.  I love the chart with all of the buildings with their hierarchies.  Really, you are planning out the most efficient way to build the buildings available to you, while keeping an eye on blocking connections if you have to.  It's nice to wait and see as many buildings as possible before you build, so you can plan everything.  But you always have to go sooner than you want in order to use the natural resources on the board before others scoop them all up.  Great game.

I have played it twice now and I still think it's a very nice game although nothing spectacular - I don't understand what's the fuss about. It has understandable and clear mechanisms but I don't see any reason why I would be playing this dozens of times - I believe the only why to really win this game is to build all the buildings (good and experienced players won't let anyone connect the temples), that's why I fear this is too limited. But there certainly is some tactical thinking required.

Easy to deal, and it can be played again and again (the more I play the more I like it, 7 it is possible that in two months it has it in 10). Simply brilliant for two players, the tension is felt in the environment. You can devote to construct or block the adversary, the games always are different.

And the components of the game: fantastic.

RATING: 6
Clever tile-laying game that forces players to keep an eye on what their opponents are up to and react. Theme is a bit thin, although the graphics do capture the flavor of ancient Greece. This works well and definiely rewards both strong strategy and tactics, but in the end is just a bit too dry and abstract for my tastes.

RATING: 3
The players have relatively little control.  They can only purchase the buildings they draw and the layout of the board shoe-horns the players into placing the buildings into particular spaces for the resource benefits.  The actual decisions aren't difficult.  ("I need some cards, so I guess I'll draw cards; I'm out of buildings so I guess I'll draw tiles; My opponent's trying to connect two shrines so I guess I'd better block him.")

It feels like a derivative amalgamation of Knizia's tile-placement games and Settlers of Catan.

I'd like to try it with more players because I think what could make this game enjoyable is a more chaotic race for the best spots.  As a two-player game, it's pretty dull.

Why we culled it: Attika is a neat little game, and I've enjoyed the plays we've had of it over the years. That said, it didn't manage to outshine other games in the collection that scratched similar itches, and thus it had a tendency to sit for long stretches. Time for a better home.

RATING: 7.5
The two winning conditions make this game, since there is often tension at the beginning as players move to block each other's path.  Although there is luck to the drawing of tiles, the game has enough flexibility to allow you to work your way through most stretches of bad pulls.

As most of the reviews state, this is great with 2, not as hot with 3.  I would like to give this a go with 3 or 4 again, perhaps with some tweaking of the winning conditions.

Mark got me colored stones to use as markers - I will have to post some pictures soon.  The components and insert are top notch otherwise.

RATING: 6
Rating based on one 3-player game. It ended quickly when one player was able to connect from one edge to another. I never even noticed this was happening until it was too late, and apparently the other player didn't either, or did and would commit to stopping him. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
There is strategy here with some luck of how the draw of buildings, resources and tiles go. The strategy comes from blocking the temple path with buildings, deciding how to time the draw of tiles and blocking other peoples free buildings. I would be interested in playing with more than two players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Somewhat cut-throat game of managing random draws and building efficiency made much more interesting by fending off the threat of a instant-win for any player connecting temples.

The extra turn carrots guide building choices by rewarding certain groupings, the free builds for certain buildings adjacent to their prerequisites can be frustratingly elusive, and jugging resources printed on the board and from cards is lots of fun. Make interesting by the opportunity to keep tiles on your build sheet until they're playable.

I really enjoy the art of this game. The game itself allows for two strategies for victory, which is always a good thing.  I think the strategy is somewhat limited and i find it odd that you can lay the main parts of a board in a way that makes it difficult to use. Now this could be considered another layer to strategy, but it seemed to only take away from our game. The rules were straightforward and the game played out in a timely manner on the first attempt. Overall, it is a well designed game good for a few rounds of play.

A solid and fairly unique placement and connection game for exactly 3 players with some very interesting mechanisms and interactions.

Its theme is highly abstracted.

Pleasant game, though it does have the problem of "blocking responsility" which has been referred to elsewhere. If I don't feel that I have any great chance of winning I'm not sure that I'd feel obliged to block a winning play. I'd rather let it go through and get on with the next game.

Played with both two and three players. Liked it a lot the first time I played, but it has lost a bit of its appeal after my third play. As soon as the danger of a sudden connection is (almost) ruled out, it becomes a bit too much luck dependent for my taste. Even more so that in a game on a similar complexity level like Thurn & Taxis (which I, consequently, like better). Also, with two I prefer a game of Fjords for a similar "feel". Still, not a bad game to play every once in a while.

One of my personal favorite. Plays well with any number, especially two. Very unpredictable and the ending is ALWAYS very tight with one action being the winner or loser.

This game is still a winner for me. Though it still hits the table once in a while, it is somewhat dry and I can see the downside of this game.

101512: After a long hiatus, this game hit the table 5 times in a row with my wife. Still one of my favorites and in a two player setting, the game has no kingmaking issues. A winner and will likely stick in my collection for a long while. Ratings bumped up to reflect my desire to play this game often.

Unbearable.  Too much downtime.  When it isn't your turn there isn't really anything to do or even look at.  The pace of the game is dead slow, even with experienced players.  As far as the plot of the game goes, it feels less like a story and more like a math proof.  At the end of the game I don't get a sense of accomplishment.  I also feel that Attika fails as a building game—you’re not building much of anything.  Instead, you’re trying to get all your tiles out of your hand.  So, it’s basically Uno with tiles.  I wish I hadn’t bought it.

Interesting, yet simple game.  I especially appreciate that it actually WORKS well with 2-4 players.  My only problem with the game is that all of the players need to realize they're responsible for stopping others too.  As soon as it's apparent that a player isn't going to help stop others, then there's really no point in stopping anyone since the player who's doing all of the stopping is weakening himself too much to win.

But it is very easy to learn, and the rules are a bit "over the top" in describing what not to do.
There is no big advantage in starting, the two times I was the last and first to start.
I really recommend this game.

Only played two player, but it's a fine two player game. It feels like a good game, but isn't as tense and fun as some other two player games. My understanding is that it isn't good with more players.

A very nice 2-player game.  With more players, it suffers from a "I won't stop the leader, you have to do it!"-syndrome though - I'd probably drop the grade 2 full points if playing on more than 2.

RATING: 7
Fast, but decision-heavy Euro.  One of the best Euros of its era.  There's a delicious tension between developing your city as fast as possible to snatch up the good resource areas, and turning up tiles and getting resources to set yourself up for more efficient building later.  There's definitely an element of luck in this game, but it's just the right amount.  The expert player will usually win, but can occasionally be caught by a less experienced player with a bit of luck.  The variable map also makes for plenty of replayability.

Rating given after nine played games. I think I try to be too clever or then I just am too stupid, but winning this game is quite tricky.

Theme is pasted up, so in that sense not very interesting.

Try to connect the temples to each other or buidl your 30 buildings. You can 2xdraw a building or 3x build. For any action you don't do, take a resource card. Building cost nothing if you follow in the right order. The cost is reduced with pieces of land surrounding/on it. 

Not bad but there should have been a way to see on the board wich buildings you already build.

One of my go-to games if introducing a new player into the hobby- the rules are few and game play is fairly intuitive, yet the different relationships between tiles is nicely thematic and gives the game an interesting texture, and on a personal level I really appreciate the artwork and general aesthetic of the components. Best with 2 due to the Kill Dr. Lucky issue present in the multi-player game. An enjoyable 30-45 minute mid-weight game.

This is a nice action point game, where you have to constantly determine when to build, when to draw, or when to take cards, but the fact that what you get to play is determined randomly by drawing from piles creates too much of a swing for players who draw the right things at the right time.  It doesn't strike me as anything special, and I don't quite understand what makes the game so popular, other than that it can be easily explained, and thus played with family.

The game seems more serious, more somber, than many. There are a lot of things to think about. I've played it 9 times this week and only now do I begin to feel in control of my actions. It's a good game.

Good for 2 players.  The games scales well to 3 also.  There is an interesting dynamic in the game between building and drawing with a line that is hard to see even after multiple plays.  The more I play the better this game gets.  Not too complex and fairly easy to teach

Attika works very well with anything from 2 to 4 players. It is a little bit dry and, to me is much more of an abstract game than at first appears.

Used to be one of my wife's and my top choice for a light 2 player game. i don't like this with more than 2 players. 

It plays pretty quickly. The balance between strategy and luck is slightly tilted towards luck but when the draws are balanced for both players, can be pretty close. 

Don't play this much now, find it a bit boring. Maybe the games' abstract nature and fairly processional gameplay finally caught up with me.

An efficiency engine on who builds their cities to common board first. Additionally, there is an option of sudden victory by connecting two temples.

RATING: 7
Fun but a bit more luck-based than I was anticipating.  It seems like it would be pretty hard to win by connecting the shrines (at least in a 2P game), so winning came down to the luck of your tile pulls during the draw phase and having the right cards to build for free.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very good tile layer. Sort of reminds me of Through the Desert with less tension due to the random bits. The less tension part is not great (nor is the longer playing time), but the random bits do help in that it would see players of varying skill levels would have a more enjoyable time with this. The micro-level decisions are less satisfying than they are in some other games I've played, but there's enough strategic depth in the overall decisions to make this one a winner for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's kind of like Twixt, in that you're trying to connect things on opposite sides of the board.  But you can only build if you have the right resources (which the terrain you build on can give you).  Blocking isn't as easy as it first looks, either, as additional board tiles can be placed for completed building sets, changing the board layout enough to bypass a blocked area.

A best-of-breed eurogame.  Extremely elegant, scads of difficult decisions, yet the constraints reduce AP and downtime.  The pressure of shrine connections creates a perfect balance between forced defensive play and pure planning.  Increasing settlement costs makes defense and/or opportunism expensive, which is just right.  Amphoras are another great touch, again adding layers to the evaluation of each move, but without adding rules cruft.

Pure genius.

One thing that sucks about this game is if one person gets their starting city tile and nobody else does. You're basically hosed then. The other thing I don't really love is how you often have to lose one of your own turns to "block" someone else, which in turn probably helps someone else. Who gets to be the altruist?

I really like the components and feel of the gameplay pacing, but I was taken aback at the huge role of luck. If one player gets their core city as the first draw from their stack of black tiles, they have a huge advantage over someone with that starting city further down the stack.

If that can be addressed, I do like the efficiency decisions facing players, and the cascade effect of building structures for free or reduced costs if timed properly. As is, the outcome is determined by the setup of the player's tile stacks more than their decisions. Once you balance the starting tile draws, the rest of the game is quite enjoyable.

I can't say that this ignited a spark. It's not bad, it is just not very exciting. You basically try to optimize your moves each turn, which is not a bad mechanic, but not very interesting either. Keeping an eye on making connections should make the game more interesting, but keeping track of what your opponents are doing is kind of tedious. I mislike it that sometimes you are forced to block another player, thereby blowing your own position. Luck of the draw certainly plays a role in this game. Might be that this game works better as a 2-player game, but I haven't tried that yet.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Light on strategy, but does contain a splash of area influence in terms of the placement of your buildings.  I like the need to balance between room to grow your city as well as to close off and claim important spaces to disallow the possibility of your opponents from connecting temples.  However, I found the amphoras to be a bit too powerful, especially with no limitation on how many you can hold and use at the same time.  There are also instances when one has to sacrifice himself by making a suboptimal move to stop someone else from taking control of important regions of the board.  Decent game, plays quick, but not enough meat.

Great in two. Has some issues with more that two players, because bad player just spoils the game.

RATING: N/A
I got a chance to play Aeroplanes: Aviation Ascendant at Origins 2011 in a preview form and I thought I'd share my thoughts.

There's a lot to like in Aeroplanes: Aviation Ascendant. Rolling to claim new routes was really fun and there were lots of choices to make that would allow you to improve your position.

Unfortunately, there were many problems with this one. Found myself investing a lot in passengers in the 2nd round, but apparently I was 1 short, so I got very few points (bonus is given to the 1st and 2nd place). I don't like this aspect of the game, since it is very difficult to be able to determine how many passengers the other players had.

I also, found myself in a bad position at the start of the last round, since there were no passengers going to North America and 2 going to South America. I wasn't positioned to deliver those passengers, but this information was not available till the last round of the game and I couldn't do anything to fix it...

In general, there are some possibilities for a great game here, but the I would not buy it the form I played at Origins.

Current Verdict: Not for me 

NOTE: I've removed my original rating (6), since I have only played this once and in prototype form.  I willing to give this another shot before posting the rating.

Fun Wallace game with an interesting economy.  At heart, a order-fulfillment game.  Played smoothly and had a fair sense of progression.  The dice added some odd elements, but I think there were plenty of ways to mitigate the risk.  I'll happily play it again, but I probably won't buy it.

First two games (3 and 5 player) showed that the game works well at ends of the player range. The game plays exceptionally good. The decisions are easy to see but hard to make. O you expand Europe or move to longer distance? To some extent this depends on the passengers and so each game will be different. The aeroplane cards are beautiful and that system works well too. Cheaper or more expensive planes? Ones with more airport capacity or less? 

Typical interesting and engaging Wallace game.

Another good game from Martin Wallace. I enjoyed the game mechanics, I have only one issue concerning this: I really didn't enjoy the random starting player system, it lacks of a mechanic that gives the player control of some situations, but in every other matters the game seems very balanced and there are some strategies possible. There is another thing I didn't liked, the art, the board is terribly ugly.

I'm a little divided on Aeroplanes. After playing one time, I would rate my enjoyment of the game at an 8 (very good). But I can see how some of the strange design choices where much of the board is rather irrelevant might really bug and possibly bore me in future plays. Aeroplanes has some funky idiosyncracies that makes me think, hmm, this game is both fun but also weird in a not so good way at the same time.

The art is also pretty horrid for a mainstream publisher game. It's a little bit silly how bad it is. That's an aesthetic problem more than anything. The theme itself is actually decent.

RATING: 6.7
As much as I love Martin Wallace games, I don't care for this one.  I view games as broken when you make no mistakes in a long game and are effectively eliminated early on through no fault of your own - in this case dice rolling was the culprit.  I made no glaring mistakes in the first round and, due to horribly bad dice rolling, ended up with two VPs, less cash and fewer airports than everyone else going into the second round - which hamstrung me in that round too.  The third round was about as good as I could have done, given my board situation, (scoring more points than anyone but the eventual winner)and that was still [i]barely[/i] enough to pull me out of last place.   I love a little luck and dice rolling in a game but this just has far too much luck for a game this long.

The kind of game I really like from Martin Wallace.  Creating a net of airports to transport passengers, that's the point.  Difficult to explain, but then the game flows quite well.  At the same level of difficulty as Automobile.
It has some luck involved at the time of setting the airports, but this just adds some tension.  Very enjoyable.
Really good.

RATING: 7.7
A simulation of the aviation industry, much like automobile is a simulation of the auto industry in almost the same era. The game has some very nice balances that work well, however it has a spatial element that is very fussy when trying to pick which passenger suits you. I would rather the passengers had a quantitative difficulty of obtaining, and your chances of getting them would increase with each airport. That way less luck would be involved and the players wouldn't have to worry about having an airstrip in the exact correct location.

Heavier economic game with multiple ways to score. Gamers who like optimal, long term strategies may be frustrated with this one.  But then again, this is the dangerous, chaotic, and risky world of early aircraft...not the predictable and orderly world of rail development.  The random elements will force players to find a way to win in that moment, not preordained before turn 1.  Very deep game that is underrated.  UPDATE (after 4 years):  Dropped a point.  Yes, it is chaotic, but maybe a little too chaotic.  Random first player, random distribution of passengers, random attempts to set up new airports.  Some of these random elements can be mitigated with purchasing pilots, mechanics, etc.  But for others, nothing.

RATING: 4
Feels like this game is specifically designed for people interested in aviation history in the beginning of 1900's. So if you love the historical planes, you probably like this, but for any regular gamer with no enthusianism about aviation history it feels quite flat. Also I believe there are better logistics games than this. The rulebook is confusing, in the end playing was ok, but there are too many better games out there.

Too much luck for the length of game. I am not luck-averse at all, but here, it just seem capricious. Rolling for airport placement seems kinda weird, thematically, and kicks you when you are down with the engine failures. The passenger tile draw is really random as well, and can make or break your game. Also, there is some direct confrontation, with airport overbuilding, that left a bad taste. I won my game with a late flight to North America, combined with 10 points worth of passengers waiting for me. Neat-ish, but could have been better.

I had higher hopes from this since Martin Wallace is, in my opinion, a great designer. However, this one kind of fell flat for me (and the rest of my game group). There are some fiddly rules, a rather large chunk of luck in a meaty euro and a big take-that aspect that just doesn't sit well with me.

Another of Wallace's underrated games. Played with 4 or 5 players, time always feels scarce. The game combines risk management, majorities and a big dose of timing without excessive brain burning. Rounds are agile and I even like the turn order mechanism, one of the game's most criticized features. On the negative side, the map is not the prettiest and could be improved; e.g. passenger tiles cover airport names.

This is a sadly overlooked gem.  The mechanics are clean and straight forward.  The artwork conveys a huge period theme and are if excellent quality.

RATING: 7.5
Another clever Martin Wallace design in which each action is precious and money management is crucial. The airplane cards are nicely balanced: choosing long-distance planes gives you one sort of advantage, choosing planes with two airports gives you another, and having lots of passengers can be a blessing or a curse depending upon your situation. 

Typical to Wallace's games, the scoring is perfectly calibrated: in our first play I was in the clear lead throughout most of the game by focusing on local flights, but another player squeaked out a victory with a few international passengers. Such close, unpredictable endings make for very satisfying playing experiences. 

I didn't like the random turn-order mechanic, which got really tedious after a while, but I understand it's there so that players can't ever count on having two turns before everyone else has also had two. Rating may go up after more plays.

RATING: 5
I'm normally a big Martin Wallace fan, but for some reason this one just felt kind of "blah" to me, and I can't exactly put my finger on why, other than it just wasn't all that fun or interesting.

Players are trying to score VPs by buying airplanes, which allow them to both build airports and shuttle around passengers.  You need to build airports where the current queue of passengers want to travel, and you also need to have enough passenger space in your airplanes for them.

In typical Martin Wallace style, you need to be able to calculate rather exactly what you'll need, or you'll be punished.  Get too few planes, and you'll miss out on valuable passengers.  Get too many planes, and get penalized for having unused passenger space on your planes.

One point of frustration for players that like a lot of control is that players can build over other players' airports, and it happens quite often, which bones you out of being able to shuttle around various passengers.  Passengers can also be sniped by other players.  While this can be mitigated a bit by proper planning, and you always have to prioritize based on what other people might do to you, I can see it being a point of frustration, especially if you get boned continually.

Overall, a solidly built game that works just fine, but lacks that spark for me that would make me want to play again.

Considering I love eurogames and have rated almost 500 games, it’s pretty weird that I haven’t played a single Martin Wallace game until now! And this game isn’t even one of his “usual” games. I own Age of Industry and would love to try Brass, but Aeroplanes turned out to be the first Wallace game I’ve played. It wasn’t that hard to learn, although I struggled to understand the strategies and such against the two other players who had played it before. Yes, we were only 3, and I suspect the game would be better with 4, but I also think 5 would turn the game into a boring game with a lot of downtime, nothing to do when it’s not your turn and a game in which it would be hard to plan a few turns ahead; this certainly wasn’t the case in our game, which was great. I thought I would definitely lose, but I somehow actually ended up winning… 

The small benefit tiles you can get by rolling dice are great, but I don’t really like that you depend on the dice without any way of mitigating the luck. The same goes almost for long distance routes, though you do have the ability of your air captain. I liked the pick-up-and-deliver mechanic with the passengers (and that you also had to fill your planes!) and the “area majority” scoring in the three different regions. However, in the end I didn’t care much for it and it isn’t a game I would actively seek out to play.

Better than I expected. I like it more than Automobile. Not that they're super related. There is a large luck element in trying to establish new airports (outside of Europe), which may drive some (many?) players away, but I actually don't mind it, because otherwise it's a grinding spreadsheet game. Oh, there's also significant luck in what passengers come out. They may naturally match the routes you already have, they may not. Building airports to far-away locations may be worth a lot of points, or it may not.

While I am usually a fan of Martin Wallace's games, this one did not strike me as one I would like to play again. In the game I played, the next-start player rule greatly reduced the number of turns that two of the five players had. They didn't play poorly, but just got significantly less turns. Unless there is a fix for that rule, I have to declare the game broken.

RATING: 7
Despite a not so satisfactory first play of this I quite liked what I saw in the game.

There is some area majority, board positioning, risk management, route and delivery planning, along with some turn finnessing with the advantage tiles (something I used very badly in the first play) - and this is all mixed up with a dash of first player randomness.

Scrambling for points in a chaotic setting makes this resemble MW's earlier 'God's Playground', as does the dicing for success although never actually being required to roll against the other players. For me the dice here are fine and there are plenty of ways to mitigate the excesses of 'outrageous fortune' with the 'risk' dice - not so much though with the turn dice. The control freaks will not like the dice though.

There is a fair amount of chaos randomness inherent to the game and this, along with the playing time, increases with player count - to the extent that I would say do not play with 5 players. The game will run too long for what it is and the winner will probably be decided by good fortune. Less than that and things are manageable.

Would like to play again.

The rule book is fairly poor and was inadequately QA'd by Mayfair and there are some poor graphic design choices:-

- Rule omissions regarding airport 'upgrades'
- Player aid card with mismatching numeric bullets.
- A number of gobble-di-gook sentences on the final page.
- Identically sized components with different functions not double side printed - passengers therefore get mixed up with advantage tiles.
- The city/passenger spaces around the board are not colour coded sufficiently to be able to be differentiated when passengers occupy the spaces.

The aeroplane cards are great though and the game is defintely worth a try if you are not completely dice averse.

Players launch and grow an airline, out of Europe, just after the end of the first world war.  Players manage funds to purchase aircraft, which grant one or two airports to place on the game board.  Airports are risky, often requiring a die roll to successfully place, and grow out from your starting location.  Eventually they will leave Europe and expand across the globe.  Founding airports allows you to deliver passengers, which fill up slots on your aircraft.  At the end of each of the three game rounds you score points for passengers delivered, and airport majorities in regions of the globe.  At the end of the game, passengers who reached the extremeties of the board, and some aircraft, add in additional points.  

Interesting game with some random elements that will not sit well with some.  Having airports rely on a die roll can lead to frustration, but you can mitigate the risk with bold pilots and cash.  The real bugbear for me was you may spend the entire game setting up routes and not get any lucrative passengers heading that way, or they are departing from the airports in Europe you didn't establish in.  The rulebook was just above awful, and the game way too long.  Not sure what the developers were doing here, but they seemed to have phoned this one in.  Loved the aircraft art though, so a bonus point for that!

A nice mid-level game from Wallace. Some very nice long term decisions to take as you continuously juggle with the need to get more airport on the map with being able to fill your planes. Make sure to get some advantage tiles, especially Increased Production as it allows you to take an extra airport, which is essential.
Very very good, and fairly easy to explain.

I tried really hard to like this one but in the end I found it just annoying and moved it on. The ostensible fun of the game is risk management and push-your-luck of opportunities. Turn order is randomly determined each and every turn with a die roll so you don’t know if you should take a few VPs now for sure or risk them to maybe get more next turn. In theory, that is fun. 

In practice, however, the effort to make that happens becomes drawn out past the fun factor. Since opportunities are so vulnerable to changing circumstances, the game forces you to constantly re-evaluate your priorities based on the unpredictable turn order. It’s like a group puzzle that players put together each turn only have all the pieces scrambled up again. Now you have to stop and re-evaluate which pieces you want to go where first.

In particular, I found those turns where I was start player to require a lot of time so as not to waste this precious opportunity. The flaw here is that you're not spending a lot of time considering the game's depth of options, you're spending time re-configuring the same damn puzzle you had put just put together a few minutes ago. Our games pushed into the 3 hour territory and didn’t feel that they were filled with anywhere near that amount of interesting decisions, just a lot of the same ones made over and over again.

RATING: 7
A fun risk management gave that is lighter than many other MW games, but with enough players the decisions are interesting. IMO this games shines with 5; it seems you should removed a portion of the tiles if you have fewer players, otherwise the game seems to ground to a halt as meaningful choices fade leaving the ending kinda flat.

Aeroplanes is fairly light for a Wallace game. That's not to say there are no hard decision or there isn't any tension but the number and effect of random events (in particular establishing new routes and the passenger draws) are such that even the best laid plans can fail without any fault of your own or the competition.

Using the die for turn order is only logical with these premises. It simply adds another source of uncertainty. It seems pretty obvious that while Wallace games typically have strong planning elements in which turn order considerations often play a big role he wanted something else entirely for Aeroplanes. Wallace: The Family Game isn't quite it (it still has the signature quirkiness) but it isn't too far from the truth.

Pretty cool Martin Wallace game. About the same 'weight' as Tinner's Trail. Some people in my group complain about die rolls, but to me they add an acceptable (and realistic) element of unpredictability of dangers of early air travel. Certainly plays more chaotic than a typical Wallace game though, so it won't be everyone's cup of tea.

RATING: 4
Aeroplanes: Aviation Ascendant is another Martin Wallace title that feels either incomplete or just phoned-in. It seems these days Wallace is more interested in taking over Knizia for most prolific game designer than creating the solid, brain-melty goodness of years past.

Aeroplanes has too many random elements and is overly tactical for the amount of time and thought players need put into each turn.

The turn-order mechanic seems very gamey and prevents most long term strategy. The building over of airports also seemed a little gamey and not thematic.  Most players at the table felt there needed to be some compensation for hosing someone's position.  This issue is magnified when one can't predict turn order.  There is also the roll to see if you make connections mechanic which, although mitigable, is just annoying and creates an unnecessary obstacle.  

Overall a very average design that I feel fanboys will love and overly praise.  

This is Martin Wallace's dice game.

Hmm. Not bad, though a bit lacking in polish. Some very important rules are not entirely clear. The randomness is an odd choice. The three "risk" dice work well enough, and there are good ways to minimize luck there, but the random starting player die seems unnecessary and a little silly. The more traditional rotating starting player would probably have sufficed. Another large dose of randomness is present with the various passengers that appear. Most of them want to stay in Europe, it seems, making networks elsewhere a bit of a gamble. The game may grow on me.

I have only played once so far and only with 3 - I think it was brilliant and can see that it should scale well with each number but will definitely work best with 4

Rerated May 2013 - it's good but not as good as I initially thought and doesn't scale well to 5 at all. I've moved it down to 8

(09/17/2013) Comment based on first play.

This is yet another solid, accessible, and fun game from Martin Wallace, that is a fine blend of Jet Set, Automobile, Brass, Struggle of Empires, and Railroad Tycoon. Claiming routes and then delivering passengers is similar in feel to the game mechanism in Jet Set. The theme of the dawn of commercial aviation is captured in a similar fashion to Automobile, with the march of technology depicted on cards as a string of developing airplane types.

Each successive airplane type has varying cost, passenger capacity, range, and number of airplane terminals. There is a random assortment of passenger tokens scattered throughout the six major cities in Europe. Each token represents a number of passengers, as well as the destination. Players slowly develop networks from their home city, placing terminals in other parts of Europe, as well as extending into Africa and Asia. A passenger token can be delivered, as long as a player has terminals at both the departure and destination cities, and the player has an airplane with sufficient capacity (passenger groups cannot be split up). This feels like the "pick up and deliver" mechanism present in Wallace's other train games, notably Railroad Tycoon and Age of Steam.

However, as players build their networks outside of Europe, of if they wish to skip a city, then establishing a remote terminal becomes a risky proposition, where they must "test" the route connection by rolling a certain number on three dice--10+, 12+, or 14+, abstractly representing the difficulties and risk posed by the distance and terrain (imagine trying to fly across the Atlantic for the first time, or flying over the Himalayas). Interestingly enough, any "1"s that are rolled, represented as skulls, represent engine failures, which seemed to be common back in the day. Four engine failures means a loss of a turn. Players can establish as many terminals as they wish (and have) in a single action, but with a certain level of "push your luck" built-in, depending on the relative remoteness. 

The game is straightforward in terms of the menu of possible actions: 1) Buy a new airplane, with new terminal(s) and capacity; 2) Establish terminal(s) and "testing" the connections; 3) Claim a passenger token; 4) Buy an "advantage" token(s); or 5) Take a bond (money) as a subsidy. Advantage tokens can help with the testing dice rolls, either by adding bonuses or allowing re-rolls, clear out engine failures, claim an additional terminal when buying new airplanes, or allowing the claim of an additional passenger token. Because there is a sufficient amount of randomness in terminal placement and turn order, these are essential tools of risk management in helping a player expand their network and fulfilling their total passenger capacity.

Each player takes an action in a clockwise fashion. However, at the beginning of every turn, a die is rolled to determine the first player for that turn. Although this can be seen as a random element, it quickly became apparent that there had to be a level of uncertainty in turn order. Because of the cramped space in Europe, it is possible that two or three players that have terminals in a major city may be in equal contention to claim one or two passenger tokens. Since it takes two actions to establish a connection and then claim the passenger token, if some deterministic turn-order mechanism was in place, a player could conceivably manipulate the turn-order (just like in Brass, for example), and either block another player's claim or claim the token themselves. Because of the random nature of the turn order, it becomes incumbent on the player to make such a claim as quickly as possible. It also forces a player to be a flexible as possible and have back-up plans.

There are three "eras" in this game, but the number of turns within each era is variable and dependent upon how the money is spent amongst the players. As with other Wallace games, a new era opens up seemingly more sophisticated airplanes, as well as the more "modern" terminals associated with them, and opens up the variety and power of the advantage tiles. Similar to Brass, one's Era II terminals can "cover" another player's Era I terminals, and Era III terminals can obsolete Era I and II.

Each era starts with a "pool" of 8x one-Pound bond subsidies. This pool acts as the game clock to determine when each era ends. If players start running out of money, they can take a subsidy of 1 Pound. When all eight bonds are taken, the era is over, followed by VP scoring for the most presence in the three areas: Europe, Africa, and Asia, with scoring similar to Struggle of Empires. VP is also awarded for profitability, which is the total number of passengers delivered minus any unused capacity. There are also extra VP awarded for delivering specific passenger tokens to remote locations, such as North America or Australia.

This is simply a fun game, racing to make route connections as quickly as possible, deliver as many passengers as possible, without buying too much capacity, in order to generate a positive profitability and hence VP. It is also a balancing act of getting enough advantage tokens for risk management, to get through the bad rolls (sort of like the tools in Stone Age). The game mechanisms are familiar and simple, with quickly resolved actions, so there is very little downtime. Still, our first game took two hours, but it was quite enjoyable. Wallace's design poses delightful and delicious decisions at every turn, with plenty of interaction. It is classic "pick up and deliver" train game that doesn't feel like a train game; it feels like one is truly developing a network back at the dawn of commercial aviation, replete with risks, frustrations, and rewards of expanding the frontier. This is a solid "8", with room to grow.

(01/24/2015) It's been 15 months and I cannot get it to the table. Some people are put off by the random turn order mechanism, but they don't appreciate why it is there. It's still an "8" in my book.

Something of a return to form for Martin Wallace, whose recent games have been either aimed at the mainstream (Ankh-Morpork, Doctor Who) or just plain disappointing (A Few Acres). There's the usual historical theme, but plenty of ways to score either by building airports or carrying passengers between destinations. Similar in many ways to Automobile, with much more variety in the range of actions. Some luck in the die rolling, especially for turn order, but it feels manageable during route building. I suspect having a mainstream publisher is a factor here, but if only MW could produce more games like this and less of the underdeveloped Treefrog efforts, I'd have more of his games in my collection.

The game without a target.  Not for casual players (too long, way too many rules and nuances, lots of screwage), neither for geeks (too light).  And it's _definitely_ too long for what it offers.

Rolling a die to determine a starting player each turn is tedious, time-consuming, stupid and - above all - doesn't add anything to the game.

Advantage tiles don't work as well as planned.

I can imagine the chaos with 5 players - the map is tight and overbuilding others' airports will be omnipotent.  Go try to plan something...

'Wallace is finished' slogan is still well alive and valid.  From his last 15 games only 2 are noteworthy (Automobile (2009) and London (2010)).

Initial Rating: 6.0 (January 2017)

Martin Wallace is one of my favorite game designers, so I always play his games. It took me a while to play Aeroplanes: Aviation Ascendant but I finally did it :D.

The rules of the game aren’t very complex. You can explain them under 16 minutes. Playtime is around 2 hours.

The art of the game is regular but in form with many great Wallace´s games so I had a high hopes for it. It is also very functional. Some of the tiles were damaged during the punching process. Components are regular in general.

The decisions are not obvious, but still, I was expecting something heavier from Wallace. In your turn you can buy airplanes, install airports, buy advantage tiles, get money or transport passengers but as I wrote before it isn’t that hard to play. 

Aeroplanes: Aviation Ascendant has many mechanisms reminiscent of previous Wallace´s games.

Best with 4 players.

After all players have played their turn, the first player has to roll the die to see who will become the first player, so it is basically luck if you play first or not and I dislike this mechanism in an strategy game. Sometimes you need to be first to ship some passengers and you are never sure if you will be, to summarize, I heavily dislike the luck of the first player die because you cannot plan ahead. There is luck with other dice as well, but in that case you know the odds and you can mitigate the luck with money and/or advantage tiles so in that case, luck doesn’t bother me. The luck to the tiles doesn't bother me either, you can react to it. 

Bottom line, I was expecting something heavier from designer Martin Wallace, still the game offers interesting decisions but they aren’t very hard. I hate the luck of the first player die, all other luck can be mitigated with clever play and/or money and advantage tiles. I think I will sell the game but I would play again if requested.

I didn't come in expecting a "typical Wallace" on the order of Brass, Automobile, Steam.  I was hoping for a solid, if lighter, title.  I really love the air transport theme and wanted to see it realized in a game.

I'm still looking.

I actually found the risk mechanic interesting.  I'm not sure 3d6 was the appropriate way to implement it, and it kind of falls apart thematically if you think about it - why should the airport fail instead of the planes?  But I like the idea of risk management in establishing new routes, and the game does provide a couple of ways to exercise caution and mitigate the risk.  I don't think the game provides sufficient payoff for early risks however.  I have to decide to establish routes to Africa or Asia before I have any idea how many passengers will want to go to which areas.  Even in the early days of aviation, wouldn't a company be able to do a little market research?  The passenger draw is problematic.  Or the right passengers may come up, but oops, they want to go from London and you're established in Paris.  It wouldn't have added that much complexity to allow for "code-shares", giving an opponent some of the profit to deliver the passenger intra-Europe.  Instead I might be locked out of delivering a passenger to South Africa, even though I'm the only player with a route there, because last era I happened to build into the wrong European airport.  Great.  Yes you can overbuild but that presents its own problems in that another player can lock you out of an airport you've been in since the start and take away your ability to move passengers that way.

The airplane purchases are a reimplementation of one of my favorite aspects of Automobile, and I think it works well here too.

The turn order die roll...I don't object to this in principle, but in a Martin Wallace game it seems nothing short of insane.  Wallace's best games are characterized by heavy emphasis on turn order positioning.  He's justly lauded for his innovative ways for players to manage turn order as in Brass, Age of Steam, and Automobile.  In Aeroplanes turn order remains highly critical especially in the late game VP races for far-flung areas, but there's no way to make sacrifices to ensure you go ahead of a specific opponent.

I wish I could like Aeroplanes but I just can't.  It's not that it's too light.  If I just found it too light, I'd rate it 6 or 7 and be done.  It's that the interesting decisions I can make are overwhelmed by the randomness to the point that they don't seem to mean much at all.

Solid game but not as good as Wallace's best which, IMHO, is Automobile.  Like the plane cards and illustrations, some find parts of the game a bit fiddly the way turn order can bounce around and determine key outcomes.  Have not played recently but still rate it highly, just not a game that would come close to Automobile or others in my all-time top 10.

UPDATE:  With the recent arrival of the similarly-themed Tin Goose, decided to drop the initial rating down a peg due to the fact that the mechanics in Tin Goose seem alot better, more streamlined, to the extent that the likelihood I will pull this game off the shelf or suggest it are now quite a bit less.

Whilst not super heavy, it’s heavier than most of the games Martin Wallace has made in the last couple of years and it’s all the better for it. I dominated Europe in my first play and found it was not quite enough. I did not pay enough attention to which planes were worth VPs and did not ship enough passengers outside of Europe.

I definitely enjoyed aspects of this game. You need to buy planes which give you airports. You place the airports and then use the planes to pick passengers. You are scored for maximum number of airports in a region and for profitability. Probably the main annoyance was that every round you had to roll the dice to see who went first. There was also plenty of die rolling to expand into some of the regions, but there were options for off-setting those rolls. I would play the game again, but not on a frequent basis. With a little more refinement it could be a great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Considering Wallace's usual creations, Aeroplanes is an almost simple economic game of being one step ahead. On their turn, players choose a single action out of five different options. Nothing too overwhelming. The only confusing aspect is the implemented concept of profitability which is somewhat counter-intuitive in its results on VPs. There is some randomness in the drawn passenger tiles which could hamper players if they build up in expectation for certain destinations to come out but nobody is forced to build proactive. I don't mind the often criticized die roll for turn order which is ok considering the limited effects of a single turn.
Aeroplanes hits my soft spot in terms of theme (too few good airline games) and lightness which is why I rank it up there with his heavier economic games although it will have a lower appeal to the BGG crowd. Mayfair could have done a bit more work on the player aid cards which differ in wording from the rules and even have mistakes on them.

I like randomness in games, but Aeroplanes has too hefty of a luck element for such a long game. And speaking of length, Aeroplanes lasts wayyy-yy-yy too long for what it is.

The game is also riddled with numerous odd design choices (why would anybody build airports in the far-east) and equally numerous usability issues ranging from misprints to graphic design that could've been much clearer. 

Overall Aeroplanes leaves the feeling that it is an unfinished game that was rushed into production. With more development it might've been a good game. Now it's not.

TWO RANKINGS:  

Three player game is a 5.  There just isn't enough competition or jostling for position in a three player game as the game is wide open.  

Four-Five player game is much better and ranks a 7 for me.  Competition is fierce and the run on customers can be painful for end of round income if you aren't paying attention.

Relatively simple for a Wallace although there are still a fair bit of moving parts.  Expand your airline network, buy planes, fill planes with passengers, buy improvements, or take a subsidy.  The airport building can really be frustrating if the dice aren't rolling your way.  I am not sure if North America is ever a good idea.  Start player mechanism is different and I am uncertain how I think of this...start player rolls a die and counts around the table the number of pips for new start player.  I do like how this may lead to you taking a chance as you might get start player and gain the desired plane or customer if your opponents are stalling thinking their customer is safe...:-)  

I am not a fan of the fact that you never know the distribution of customers and that there will always be a number of customers you will never see.  This leads to more tactical play in many cases with perhaps a slight hedging of the bets to think strategically with regards to potential.  Third round is totally tactical as you know exactly what remains.

This is a Martin Wallace game that looks and feels almost exactly like a Martin Wallace game. Buy planes, which enable you to build airports, which enable you to establish routes to other places. It's the early days of aviation, so flying can be tricky. We played this at Unity Games and it was the last game of the evening, so we we kind of tired and a rowdy game of Pit started next to us making the rules hard to hear and focus on. Still, I think we got it right. It's pretty clear that three is not an optimum number for this and 4 or 5 is better. While Al and Matt fought for dominance over Europe, I carved out a path to Australia and delivered two passenger tiles there, giving me the win, which was dumb. No way I deserved that. It's a good thing those people were going there, though, because the 5 or 6 airports I established to get to Australia were nearly worthless to me, thanks to random passenger tile draws. I don't think any of us were blown away by this.

RATING: 8
Wow! I just finished my first game (5 players) and I've gotta say, I LOVED it! But now I understand where a lot of the comments about this come from. Not everyone is going to like this.

First of all, I'm a huge Wallace fan. This is definitely a Wallace game -- that is, I find some very interesting decisions to be made. It does have a huge luck factor, unlike most of his games. But for me, that was a large dose of the fun. No, you can't plan on something and guarantee that you're going to get it. That's where I found the dice roll for turn order to be ingenious. At first, I just said, "What the heck?" But then I began to see why it was there.

Frequently, I found myself in competition with someone over a passenger. Let's say that my opponent is set up to make a big passenger delivery. Perhaps I'm also set up, city-wise, but maybe I need to buy another plane in order to carry the passengers, or maybe I already have the plane but I need to build an airport into a city in order to get the passenger. With a little luck, I may be able to buy what I need or build and, when the turn order is rolled, I might get to go again before my opponent and snag away the passenger. But do I take the chance? Is he/she even looking to get the passenger? Many times I went for the more sure play, but I had to watch for this constantly. Someone might try to do the same thing against me. Yeah, you can totally get hosed. There is a lot of possible screwage in this game. But everybody's going to get some of it sometime. You can't count on getting the turn order to do what you wanna do before the other guy.

Second, sure, your airports can get built over. You definitely have to try to deliver passengers when you can, and watch for the right time to build over someone else to protect yourself, or to lock in those era 3 airports that can't be built over.

Third, the dice rolling for expanding your airport network is definitely risk-taking. You need some luck at the right time to win this game. You can attempt to mitigate it some with the advantage tiles, but you never know what's going to happen. I bought some tiles, thinking I would need them and then I got lucky on my roll. But I had to spend some actions to get those tiles. Meanwhile someone could have leapfrogged ahead of me to build where I wanted to first and beat me to the punch. I like this push-your-luck element. It is unlike any Wallace game I've played and yet it felt like another worthy addition to the canon.

So, I can easily understand why some may not like this game much, even hate it. I am completely surprised by it myself, but in a good way. It's not short. I don't think I would even call it that light, because there are a lot of things to think about and the decisions can bog down for some people. Don't take it too seriously or you'll be disappointed. The best laid plans...and all that. You've got to play this one loose and hopefully.

One caveat: we found the rules to be pretty unclear on a number of points, particularly the way airports are put out. It took one full game just for us to be sure we understood everything correctly, making some mistakes along the way, and this, after looking up a number of rules here on the Geek.

BUT, I can't wait to play it again. Another great Wallace game, IMO.

Update 26/11/2016: I completely misread the game and rules when I first played this. A fresh set of eyes, and thorough learning session showed the elegance in this game. Glad I kept it!

Automobile entered my top ten list and the recently acquired Ships also looks promising. Naturally, I'm curious how the third game in Martin Wallace's transport series play. Comments about the importance of checking the player to your left (and hence a risk that a newbie inadvertently helps an experienced player) makes me hesitate but I still want to play Aeroplanes.

----- Preliminary thoughts -----

Random factor too important for a 2 hours long game.

Random starting player doesn't seem to be great idea (difficult to plan, can be very punitive if you have a bad luck stretch).

Chase the leader mechanism too powerful. Very easy to take the leading player out of the game by building over his airports the next era.

A solid set collecting game, with just enough random quirks to upset traditional Euro fans but not enough theme to attract trashers. As I mostly straddle both camps, I didn't mind this, thinking it decent enough. You collect a plane fleet card that gives you an airport token or two and provides capacity. Plant your tokens on various airports, and then start collecting the passenger tokens at the airports where you have tokens that have a destination where you also have a token. Fill your fleet to capacity, acquire more capacity and more airport tokens, continue. You'll get points at the end of each of the three rounds for collecting the most passengers (less any unfilled capacity, so you need to be careful to be close to full at the end of each round), plus some area majority points for having most tokens out in each of the three continents shown. There's plenty of luck in whether new passengers come out each round on your airports that you can immediately claim because they're going someplace you already have a token. Also, expanding out to the far-flung destinations (where the VP passengers go) involves some hairy die-rolling - which can be alleviated by spending some actions building up emergency chits which allow you re-rolls and other action manipulators. There's your risk management. So at its guts it's building a network to allow you to claim the most passengers (hope you get lucky) together with a race to build the most airports. With some vicious Brass-like airport higher-tech airport token overbuilds in the end-game to claim the area-majority points. The one thing that doesn't work well is if you run out of money and actions earlier than the other players - it takes forever to claim all the money out of countdown zone (when it runs out, the round ends) which makes for some dullness. That and the pain of rolling for start player every turn, which means if you want something, claim it fast because it's possible for anyone to have 2 turns before you go again - non-conducive to game flow. Anyway, despite some rough edges, the game worked fine and provided some interesting planning and risk mitigation decisions along the way. I'm not sure I want to play with the full complement of 5 - urghh on the downtime and the inability to plan with so much competition on the board for those passengers. With 3, you could mostly safely plan ahead, with the occasional surprise, and that felt about right.

RATING: 7
This is a Euro where you build airports and buy planes in order to fly passengers around the world. We all made some mistakes and I will surely have to play again, which is often the case for Martin Wallace games. There is also a slight push your luck aspect to the game as you must roll dice to see if you can establish new routes. At the end, we all enjoyed it, but would surely have done a lot of things differently. I will bring it back next meeting.

Rather enjoyable game. Not sure how deep it really is, but the dice/passengers/turn order really make this game variable. I'd like to try this out with 4-5 players and see what I think of it. It felt like a really light Brass.

Update: After a 5 player game, I still found this game quite fun. I think 3-4 might be the sweet spot, but 5 was enjoyable.

Try Oct/12, 3p.  Enjoyed the strategies involved throughout, and the fact that the game itself wasn't overly-complex, even though the options were abundant at times.

However, the game was extremely fiddly.  Lots of small chits, plane cards that were overly large & specific in their ordering, constant making of small change, passengers clustered into one corner, but not clearly separated per city, etc.

I've since read this elsewhere, but I agree that the end-game in particular was lacking interest & intensity.

This game is a must buy for Wallace fans that don't mind a bit of randomness...

I really enjoyed Aeroplanes. I have played with 4 and 5 players. With 5, which I think is best...there is a lot more tension and competition for available planes, passengers and city location. There is also a lot more restocking of passengers and cycling through available planes each round. As is the case with many tactical games like this, players must keep their opponent seated to their left (clockwise) in check, cutting off opportunities as best as possible.  A player that fails to do this and only focuses on his own points engine can ruin the gameplay experience for all participants.

This is my only concern with the game and fortunately not an issue with my game group. If I were to play this game with a mix of experienced and inexperienced gamers I might consider introducing a variant where the white dice result not only determines the start player of the next turn but also defines turn order rotation ... clockwise on odd results (1,3,5) and counter clockwise for an even results (2,4,6). This would minimize the effect of an experience player not kept in check by an inexperienced player seated to his/her right.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
First let me start by saying that when I first explained this game to everybody, we all agreed that the rolling dice for starting player was just timeconsuming and didn't add anything to the game. So we just determined a random start player for the first round, kept on taking turns in clockwise order and the new starting player for the next round was the one who took the black token (according to the rules). Off course my thoughts and rating or based on playing the game this way.

I hadn't heard or read anything good about this game. But as I like most or Martin Wallace's games, I gave it a try anyway. And I'm very glad I did! 
This ain't no Brass of Age of Steam off course, it's indeed easier then those, but it still requires some good thinking and planning to get those precious and hard to get victory points. Especially if you're aiming for points from profit (which is 1 of the 3 ways (the other are majorities and VP from aeroplanes/passengers), you really have to stay focussed on what you're doing and don't have to be to greedy!

Therefore I enjoyed my 1 play a lot so far and I'm looking forward to an other gameplay of this!

I like a lot of the Martin Wallace games, but this is probably one of the better ones. Players often have many things they want to go, but not enough time (turns) to do them all. The fact that the other players also want to do the same things increases this pressure. So, as a result, players have a tough decision to make each turn and also a tough decision about what overall strategy to shoot for. A unique area control and economic game.

It somewhat surprising that this is a Wallace game as it's almost too simple. It's a route building/pick up and delivery game combined with a management mechanic where you try to minimize empty spaces on your planes. I think I'll like it, but it's more a heavier Ticket to Ride than a lighter Automobile.

A good game that has some minor component and rules problems.

The Mayfair edition has the counter spaces on the board slightly undersized for the counters (should be the other way around).  And there needs to be a distinct separation of the tiles for one city from those of another city (but using match sticks as a separator would be O K).

The rules are not as clear as they should be.
1.  Should left over capacity from one era count negative for the next era, and does filling that capacity also cancel out the plus score for the new era (i.e change a -1 to a zero instead of a +1).
2.  Does the double route step aeroplane from one era also count for the next era(s)?  Or does this have to be acquired afresh in each era?
3.  It should be clearer what player scores are if the passenger counters are put at the side of the aircraft cards instead of on top of the capacity box.
4.  And it would be helpful to have a stand up first player marker to ensure rolling for new first player occurs correctly.

Végre sor került rá! Wallace kevésbé sikeres játéka, nem is olyan rossz. Nekem személy szerint nagyon fura érzéseim voltak vele szembe. A játék mélyebb mint gondolnánk, de a kocka szerencse szerepét nagyon nehezen tudom tolerálni, annak ellenére is, hogy nagyon le lehet csökkenteni annak jelentőségét. Ha mindig rosszat dobsz, akkor - azzal a taktikával - nem győzhetsz. Igaz ami igaz, hogy kockadobás nélkül is lehet nyerő stratégiát választani. Nagyon szeretném nem szeretni, de mégis olyan érzésem van, hogy játszanék még. A csapatból is az átlagosnál több diskurzust igényelt, különösen a profit kiszámítása szabályának elhibázása miatt, mert bizony azt nagyon elszúrtuk. :)

RATING: 5
The game looks superficially a bit like a light economic game, especially since that is what one would expect from Wallace and the components, but in reality it is a tedious exercise of collecting points from the beginning to the end. It is both non-intuitive and boring, and the extra random elements in many of the actions (and new customers) just make it worse. Furthermore, there's ridiculous kingmaking potential in overbuilding the stations in the late game.

It's a pity "Aeroplanes" were branded as a "bad" Martin Wallace design. Despite the complaints about dice randomness I really think it's a very solid, interesting and tense title. Sure, it's not among his best, but it doesn't have to be - it's still a great euro.

There are many ways to develop your company. Where to invest? Focus on European market or go abroad? You have to have a clear goal and carefully watch your opponents (it's easy to loose the best passengers to someone who moves first), but with proper planning and a good sense of general situation you should be able to achieve your goals. There are always opportunities to score good points; sometimes you will be tempted to risk it to get some extra "income" and in that sense it's also a risk management game. If you go all in, you have to be ready to loose - and that's not the game's fault!

UPDATE: First game I have sold and bought again.

There's a lot to like here. Balancing actions between transporting passengers and establishing new airports can be tricky. Wallace has a knack for bringing out the theme in a game without sacrificing good mechanics.

I don't mind the dice in the game at all, even though a poorly timed engine failure can ruin a lot of plans. The one thing I don't enjoy so much is the 1st player mechanic. It slows down the game and causes too much randomness.

Overall: This one is a winner. Some small tweaks could perfect the formula and it's not Wallace's best, but still very satisfying.

I've played this only once.  It was fun and I'd be interested in playing it again, but I'm not interested in buying a copy.  The way rounds started randomly with a new player according to a die roll was a little frustrating.  While I didn't keep track of who won each roll, it seemed like I was disproportionately on the losing end as the player to my left started the round several times in a row.  I would have preferred something more predictable.

There's nothing particularly innovative here, but all the options a player has click together to produce a fast paced and simple game. Basic area majority is spiced up with placement restrictions and a passenger profit balance that players are continuously battling with against each other. Throw in a few bonus victory points on passenger tiles and planes, and you have a game where the winner is not a foregone conclusion.

Good stuff, but I'd have liked airports to be in three different sizes for the three eras - it can be a little tricky seeing what's what at a glance.

I love it.  It is a lighter, faster Wallace. And is a return to form to the old Warfrog days where you get a little luck thrown in from the dice.

The turns chop along, and I like the way that the white die breaks up the clinical nature of the game.  In many of these kinds of games you know what everyone else has so you don't need to worry about someone taking "your" action, because when they build to take something you just take the limited resource that you already have the heads up on (ala knowing that you can get family growth in Agricola when you are the only one with space in your house, and waiting to use the action until someone builds).  That isn't the case here as a player may get two turns in a row before you go and could scoop you.  This means that the pressure is on with all your actions.  In addition to that, because your turn can come back to you so quickly, you are compelled to look ahead at your turn instead of potentially tuning out.  This keeps everyone involved and the the actions clipping ahead at a rapid pace.

Lots of fun to be had. It is super interactive, while still being cerebral.

I came away from this completely unimpressed. Sure, you get to build some routes and are working to deliver connections, but I don't think that there is much tension in the game, the luck of the draw of the passengers (and the rolling of the dice) influences it greatly, and the game takes much too long for what it is. At half the time, I'd find it much more enjoyable, but 2 hours is simply one hour too long.

After 5.67 plays ... let's just call it 6:
Still enjoying this game quite a bit, with the rules as written. 

After 1.67 plays:
This is one of Wallace's economic designs, but not nearly as heavy as games like Brass or Age of Steam. Deep thinkers and planners are going to HATE the turn order mechanism, which is simply a die roll (with some players favored over others, depending on the number of players in the game -- since it's always a d6). They're also not going to like the almost complete randomness of the passenger distribution: some tiles are not allowed in Era 1, but otherwise it's totally random and you do not use all the tiles; at MOST, you'll only see 72/96, and likely a lot fewer). So you may be pretty annoyed if you spend a lot of effort building out to North America, but never see a North American passenger! They may also dislike all the die-rolling required when placing airports on the board.

However, I had quite a lot of fun with it! Whereas the first group I played with thought the turn order die roll was annoying -- made it impossible to make certain plans -- the next group (full game) absolutely [i]loved[/i] that mechanism! With all the randomness of the passenger tiles, I'm not sure that turn order stuff is really a big deal; you're going to have to play somewhat tactically anyway. I didn't time the games, but they seemed to move along fairly quickly. Like the rondel games, each turn is you're only taking one tiny little action. You have to have some idea about what you want to do over the next several turns; then, when it's your turn, you just do the next little part of your plan (although finding the right passenger on the board does sometimes take a little time)! 

The biggest potential problem I see at the moment is a tactic I stumbled upon in game 2: profit points are based only on relative rank; there's no other impact from going negative. So if you build passenger capacity (and airport presence) in Era 2 and go WAY negative, you pay that penalty only once. Then, in Era 3, you're free to acquire passengers as you see fit, while everyone else is building up their economy again (buying planes in their first several actions). This would work especially well if you concentrate on Europe, and use the extra passenger Advantage tiles. Of course, if other people start using this tactic as well, it may not work quite as nicely as it did for me.

Finally, it MIGHT be nice to remove [u]and reveal[/u] 24 passengers tiles from the game during game setup. Or maybe remove some number (24 + the number of passengers still on the board) at the end of Era 1? Or maybe, Age of Steam style, pull several passengers for each city at the start of the game, placed in a line next to the board in the order they will resupply that particular city? Then, you'd at least have some idea of whether or not any of the big-VP passengers would never be showing up (although that last option is, I think, too much information).

[b]--- Game Summary ---[/b]
The board shows a map of Europe, with cities connected by white (mostly) lines. There are 6 major cities, each with spaces for 3 airports (at the start of the game, in reverse turn order, players will place their home base in a different one each), and several smaller ones with spaces for 2. There are 24 spaces (4 for each of the 6 major cities) on the top edge, which are filled with random passenger tiles (1-3 people per tile, which also shows desired destination). The lower half of the board shows cities in Asia, Africa, and links to N. and S. America (2 airport spaces each), connected to each other by purple and/or black lines. A deck of airplane cards (sorted in numerical order, divided into 3 eras) is placed to the side, with the top 12 (or so) planes placed in a row. Give the First Player Die to a randomly chosen player.

[u]Era Begins[/u]
At the start of each Era, place 8 coins and a marker in the Subsidy Box and give each player $12/$22/$32 in Era 1/2/3. In Era 1, this may be modified by Home location. The player holding the First Player Die goes first. 

On [u]your turn[/u], take ONE action:
- [u]take a coin from Subsidy[/u]. If coins gone and you take the marker, the Era (or game, after Era 3) ends: score and do upkeep.
- [u]buy a plane[/u]: cost = price on card + number of planes skipped over. Comes with a number of airport tiles as shown on the card (1 or 2). Worth 0 or 1 VP at end of game. Also shows passenger capacity (1-6).
- [u]place airport tile(s)[/u]: may place tile into free space one connection away from your Home or previously placed airport. Extended Range planes are needed for some marked routes; also, they allow you to skip one link. First white-link connection (Europe only) has no risk; 2-length connection (extended-range planes only) requires you to roll sum 10+ on 3d6. All purple and black links have risk (need 12+ for purple, 14+ for black). Rolls are modified by +2 if there's already an airport there. You must roll for all connections used (some require multiple rolls). If you roll low, may spend money and/or advantage tiles to make up the difference. Failure immediately ends your turn. The dice 1-face is actually a 0-engine failure: take an engine failure counter. If you get 4+ of these counters, your airport is removed from game; discard engine failure counters; turn ends immediately. May only have 1 airport/player/city. If no empty spaces, may build over opponent's airport with higher-Era airport.
- [u]claim a passenger tile[/u]: must have your airports in both starting- and destination- locations, as well as a plane with available capacity: place passenger on that plane.
- [u]buy advantage tile(s)[/u]: pay $1. Then, either choose one of the available tiles (2 available in Era 1; 2 more in Era 2; all 5 in Era 3) or roll 3d6 and take any 2 (the advantage tiles are numbered 2-6; Engine Failure rolls are wild). These provide a variety of bonuses: 
... Daring Pilot: +3 on risk rolls when outside Europe (use after rolling; may use multiple/turn)
... Engine Maintenance: discard engine failure counters at START of your turn
... Increased Production: when you buy a plane, place an extra airport on it (may use max 1/turn)
... Night Flight: claim an extra European passenger (may use multiple/turn)
... Radio Beacons: when making risk rolls, may ust to ignore result and re-roll all 3 dice (may use multiple/turn)

After all players have had their turn, roll the First Player Die and pass the die clockwise that many players; receiving player is First for the next round.

At [u]End of Era[/u]:
1. For every plane with empty capacity, place those little gray chits (let's call them "capacity chits") on the plane.
2. Calculate each player's profit = (sum of all passenger tile numbers) - (sum of all capacity chits on [i]face-up planes[/i]). So, empty spots from planes in previous eras do not count against your calculation again. Award VP to the top 3 players according to the Era chart.
3. Players place all delivered passengers, as well as their full planes, into their score pile. The remaining planes (the ones with any chits still on them) are flipped over, placing the capacity chits and any unused airport tiles on the card backs. Note that the backs of the extended-range planes are so marked.
4. Majorities (# airports) in Europe, Australasia, and Africa: 1st and 2nd most get VP (escalating each Era)

Then, if it's not end of Era 3:
- remove 2 lowest-numbered planes on display from the game.
- if present, move 1 non-European passenger from each city to the Passenger Overflow area; next Era, you only need an airport in their destination city to take these passenger tiles.
- refill passenger tiles by drawing from the bag
- the player who ended the Era rolls the die and passes it accordingly (recipient will be first in next Era)

[u]End of Game Scoring[/u]
After Era 3, all your planes and passengers score VP shown on their face (add to points on VP track). Highest sum wins; money is the tiebreaker.

[b]--- Charter Tiles Expansion ---[/b]
• Setup: Each player gets a Charter tile of their color.
• During the game, you may place the Charter tile INSTEAD of a normal airport tile
- may not place into a starting city
- place on board next to the destination, outside the allowed spaces
- destination must already have an opponent's airport tile
- discard an airport tile from your available supply
• Charter tiles may never be replaced
• You may not score VP with your Charter tile

RATING: N/A
I'm a huge Martin Wallace's fan but I'm not so fond of this game. It's somehow old and clumsy. All the parts are there but they seem to follow a specific playing order that players apparently should respect. 

The new player order mechanism is cool and it adds something needed to the game but the structure itself is boring and with nothing really relevant to perform.

The complication of the game is in the awkwardness of the structure rather than in the decisions players need to take. And at some point during play, the 'figures' of the tiles (VP, passengers, airplanes, dice, technologies) don't seem to help much the result, thus making this a not very good experience.

Sweet spot is 4/5 players, for sure.

Very provisional rating based on two three player games. I think the game will be very different 3 vs 4/5. Much tighter and vicious 4/5 and more likely to cut out of minor points for area majority.

Another challenging and ambitious game from Martin Wallace.

The rules are deceptive - the game looks simple but it's as deep as Wallace's  weightier economic titles. The dice rolling adds deep risk/reward decisions rather than randomness - don't know who will be start player (the player after you might get two actions before your next)? Then calculate who could preempt you to a goal and either guarantee it or risk it. The route dice again add calculable and manageable risk/reward playoffs. The tempo you adopt is again a risk - grab the helper tiles and miss an immediate opportunity, go early to establish a route to grab passengers and risk having your airport built over. The games asks these questions every turn. The game has elements of Automobile (and AOI) without the math (income fixed for all players)- the victory conditions are simple and visible and the players thought goes into positioning and timing rather than needing to engage a calculator. Unlike AOI Brass where other players over building only happens occasionally it is guaranteed to happen here - this is going to be very unpopular with control lovers) I think the sweet spot is four with three there is little too much space and the Era two planes come out too slowly. The art work on the board is crap compared to Treefrog games which is a shame.

There is an interesting rhythm between the eras - at first it appears you should build up capacity and use it all each era - where as in fact you probably need to try and time it so that you have have two big capacity eras rather than three smaller ones. Totally depends on the other players and with the ability to over build earlier era airports watching your opponents is just as important as focusing on your own game. The passenger tile set up and draw makes the focus of each game slightly different. In my fifth game a lot of high VP passengers to the same areas came out and moving towards them and jocying for space at their European start points decided the game - in others it can be a European centric fight.

Possibly not got the mechanics/theme closeness of other Wallace titles. The art work on the board is crap compared to Treefrog games which is a shame - morover some poor grpahic design with areas not delineated and the city passenger areas having unclear boundaries.

I hope I can get this to table enough to explore it - its going to need multiple plays however i suspect it will polarize gamers with many not understanding/disliking the die rolling and losing airports in later eras.

A different type of game from Martin Wallace - there are elements of Steam and Automobile in here, but this game has its own personality and feels quite fresh. VPs are tight, so games seem quite close. Also, there is plenty of opportunity to interfere with others plans without being able to trash them completely. Really good game, maybe a great game but time will tell how this replays - I'm hoping the variable passenger draw will keep this fresh.

Update - Traded this as it wasn't getting played, and there seemed to be a little too much pointless take that in it with the airport overbuild that often punished the weaker players. I'd rather be playing other Wallace games.

However, the card graphics are excellent. I also very much like the 1st Player (added tension) and Connection Risk (push your luck) die roll mechanics, luck being perfectly applied here. The Advantage tiles are very cool, and they can help mitigate luck too.

I also like the airport replacement mechanism - sure, opponents can screw you but you can screw them back, or upgrade your own airport as a defensive maneuver. Players need a way to get into crowded airports and secure passengers, and replacing an opponent's hub is a vital strategy.

I really like what I see at first glance as far as the core design, but several of my friends just hate this game.

Too much thinking for a medium game (find the best choice takes time, look what the opponets can do,and whatican do - passengers). With more players probably no control of the game.

Economic/area-control game. Buy planes & build flight routes by opening airports in different parts of the world, over 3 era. Make a profit by carrying passengers & getting control of the 3 different areas of the world to make points and win the game. Lots of luck (Dice rolls) for a Wallace game.

This has a lot of what you might expect of a Martin Wallace game. Okay-to-bad art. Fairly complex rules. A couple fiddly exceptions to rules. And a theme with something about industry.

The most interesting mechanic, is the dice roll for turn. After a round finishes, someone rolls a dice to determine who the start player is for the next round. This allows for the possibility for someone to go twice before you go again...so that person just might scoop that route you want. It's a subtle mechanic that makes a big difference.

Overall, a pretty good game and one I wouldn't mind playing again.

Perhaps a little more luck involved than a typical Martin Wallace game, but that's OK because I think it is more of a family game than a hardcore gamer's game like some of his others.  I see my family playing this game a lot.

Once again Martin Wallace meshes a great theme with the game mechanisms. Yes the game has random elements, die rolling each round to determine turn order, and push-your-luck dice rolling to establish routes, but they serve to thwart analytical strategy and some risk taking that was part of the early airline business. The resulting ups and downs give this game some real charm.

One of the better designs by Martin Wallace. The use of the die to determine first player is an amazing mechanic that brings a lot of tension about when you need to take an action and when your next turn maybe be. This game really needed this mechanism to have a true risk management feeling. Great use of the dice in general in this game! I read some complaints here in BGG and I had my reservations, but after I played the game I am very pleased with the use of dice. Simple mechanics, brilliant design, a lot of tension, it plays in 2 hours. If you like Martin Wallace games, go and buy this one.

+ Cool theme.

- Only single side printed components. Huge pain in the a**!
- Poor component quality in general.
- Weird player turn order mechanic.

It works, but it's dull, and the endgame can really peter out with four players (it was better with three).

A lighter Wallace, but not as bad as people are talking about. Can be played very agressively - and probably will be better this way. Weird dice-turn-order mechanic.

Most of Wallace's games are overwrought, which is fine with his heavier games where the fiddle is justified, but invariably his mid-weight games fall flat with me, and Aeroplanes is no exception.

Rolling 3d6 is just too much luck; there aren't enough dice rolls or for that matter actions in the game for things to even out. 

If the game were stripped of half its rules and took one rather than two hours to play, I might dig it. As is it's just too long and processional for what it is.

An enjoyable game that gives you the usual Wallace feeling of never having enough time and money to do everything you would want to do. I liked it more then Automobile.

I love the art and theme on this one, but like most Wallace designs the spartan board makes the game look way more dull, complicated and intimidating than it actually is. On your turn you either build an airport, buy a plane or ship a passenger. Whomever does this most efficiently, wins. As far as pick up and deliver games go, it doesn't get much simpler than that.

There is a lot of criticism out there about the use of dice in this game. Personally, I think all of the dice related actions are perfectly thematic. Flying across Europe in a 1919 airplane was certainly a dicey enough affair. From a game play perspective, those dice provide uncertainty and non-scripted gameplay. They flat out work here, so I think anyone who complains about them just doesn't like the game as a whole. The dice are just a convenient place to hang the dislike. 

(Personally, I'd go after the cardboard components. They are crap. Mayfair, you should be ashamed of yourselves.)

I liked it, but not entirely sure of how much is going on.  Rating may go up with another play or two.

I like it a fair bit, but not with 3.  The game is too frustrating with 3 - not enough room so someone tends to get whacked on, but more importantly, planes and passengers don't cycle through enough.

Route building area control with airports, get the highest paying customers, purchase the best airplanes, and best upgrades. To mix things up, first player is random dice roll. Shortcuts taken on components. In your face, interactive game (e.g. your airport can be built over). Take the risk and jump into new countries early.

[i]Aeroplanes[/i] chugs along, with everything falling smoothly into place.  Then the overbuilding starts, and the game reveals its fragile, shifty design.  

Players live and die by their airports, since they lay the groundwork for both passenger deliveries and board majorities.  But airports are far too easily overbuilt in the mid- and late-game.  Once cities are fully occupied, low-level airports can be supplanted at will by high-level airports. No die roll, no stringent replacement requirements (cf. [i]Brass[/i]), no nothing. Airports just disappear.

In the last era, in fact, an unsuspecting "winning" player can be nearly eradicated from the board if one or more opponents declare a vendetta.  If this occurs in Europe, for example, the assault can result in a gamebreaking 14-point point swing (a huge fraction of available points), with the targeted player losing 7 points (Europe majority) and the targeting player gaining 7 points.  And don't forget that the outcast player loses the deliveries for those airports, as well.

That's fair, right? Stupid, stupid, stupid.

Then there's the second well-deserved object of scorn: random turn order.  Random order works fine in light skirmish games like [i]1812: Invasion of Canada[/i] (fortunes of war and all that), but here it's horrific.  Someone will lose the game, guaranteed, because random turn order either (a) allowed another player to steal a critical passenger delivery or (b) cheated a player out of a final turn that would have won them the game.

Reminder: I [i]like[/i] high-interaction games with the capacity for meanness.  But not when they're arbitrary and short-sighted.  If ever an airplane game needed an ejection seat, this was it.

A decent 90 minute economic transport game. This was like a Martin Wallace megamix. The aeroplane market is very reminiscent of the ordered progression of cars in [thing=39351][/thing]. You can overbuild other players' tokens in later ages, just like in [thing=28720][/thing]. It has the risky long-distance travel of [thing=9625][/thing] and the network deliveries of [thing=4098][/thing]. Aeroplanes is better than two of those games, though.

What's new here is the unpredictable turn order - once everyone's taken one action, you determine a random start player for next round. That leads to some fun moments. There's a lot of delicious tension around getting to complete your plans before someone else stops you, whether it be delivering particular passengers, buying certain planes or building into certain territories.

There are several useful bonus tiles which are removed from the game once used. This encourages players to grab them early while they're still available, and they are quite powerful. I'm not sure I like that they don't recycle for others to collect later, but perhaps there's a reason for this. Currently, there's a balance to be struck between grabbing bonus tiles and taking other priority actions - if the tiles were available throughout maybe that decision would be dulled. Could it be that it was tested both ways and decided this way was better? Given that it's a Martin Wallace game, I doubt it :p

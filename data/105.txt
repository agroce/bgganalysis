Titan the Arena version: Rated as a 2 player game which is much more competitve and less of a luck fest because you have much more control over the board.

RATING: 9
What a fun, little, hidden gem! Knizia did a great job with this one!

The game centers around playing cards, but players also get to bet on creatures who they think will make it through all five rounds of the game (only three creatures survive until the end). You play cards to try to make sure your creature makes it to the end and other player's creatures do not. The player who has the highest total value bets on the winning creatures wins the game.

Ummm... nice design and everything, but not as much fun or as satisfying as it could be. Probably needs to played quickly and by experienced players to achieve it's full effect

Good. Needs group that wont laugh at you when you mention 'creature abilities'. Not sure about the running out of cards thing though. I know you're supposed to end the game right there, whilst others say shuffle in first row. Neither really works.

RATING: 4
The mechanics don't make sense. There's a bunch of creatures fighting in an arena (OK so far), and I can bet on some of them (OK so far), but I also play number cards on them and this indicates whether they live or die? Am I lobbing grenades into the arena or something? And I can also "activate their special powers"? Is this done with telepathy? I don't get it. The cockfighting theme isn't a plus either.

This game is interesting; like nothing else that I've played. However, I really don't care if I win or loose in this game. Due to lack of passion, I have to give it a medium grade. If something clicks and I start getting more out of it, I will re-evaluate. UPDATE: growing on me, although I still have a lot to learn. I find it hard to pay attention to everything that goes on. I like it two player, although a few less baddies might make the game go faster. UPDATE: the game is getting better. Three or four players may be best. I really enjoy the pace of the game after all players are familiar with it... part of my problem may have been initial slow plays.

A Knizia game where you play a spectator betting on the outcome of mythological creatures fighting in a arena. You can modify their power and sometimes use the creatures special powers. This game is fine but it has fallen out of favor as newer IMO better variants such as cheaty mages have come into existence. While dated, I wouldn't say no to playing it again sometime.

Interesting game.  Bidding + card-playing.  I think some of the special powers are bit overwhelming while some are underwhelming.  A fun game, but I wouldn't recommend it enthusiastically.

Colossal Arena (CA) has a few interesting changes over Titan: The Arena (TtA), not to mention more creatures.  CA probably has more replay value, but at the expense of some balancing.  ([url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/27117]See differences here.[/url])

It is an interesting Bet game from Knizia. A little different from other games I've played from him, what is a good thing. The game itself isn't very deep and it is difficult to get the timming of the actions, because you can be very impaired by the order of play.

Pretty fun -- a good dose of luck, but the powers are interesting, secret bets are fun, and it's pretty quick.  Another nice Knizia card game.

The [i]tension[/i] really cranks up mid-game, as you realize your precious monsters are about to DIE.  It can also be a bit numbers-y/dry even with the powers, but that's Knizia for ya.

RATING: 10
Still one of my favorite games. Fast easy and always different. Secret bet on the Troll for the win!

Buffed my rating up to help the overall rating. This game needs more love. If you play with a group that knows how to play it well it is a great bluffing/interactive game. The end mechanics of the game are a little clunky but otherwise I don't see why this is rated so low.

Simple 'betting' game that sometimes is a no brainer on who to bet on. Game play is short (as short as 30 mins for a 4 player game), with random card draw/play to change the outcome of the bet.

The game has very nice art work that is repeated and most provide no other effect. Felt that the game could be played with 2 or 3 decks of poker cards.

I bought the reprint Colossal Arena by FFG.  A fast, fun, light game.

I really like the simplicity of this game along with the envocation of theme.  I picture a bunch of rich nobles at a Colisseum, rooting for their preferred monster to win.

RATING: 5
While depicted as a monster fight, this card game is really just a cascading bidding/beating card game.  Game play consists of playing a card to a pile that represents the creature's current strength.  The creature with the lowest strength is eliminated at the end of the round.  Players score points by beating on the best creatures with more points going to those that beat on the creature earliest in the game.  Despite not having a screw-your-neighbor element, the game tends to elicit a very similar feeling.  If you have the misfortune of betting on the wrong creature early on, it is hard (or impossible) to make up the difference.  The wild card bet is likely an offset to this 'problem' but the winning player is likely the one who manipulated the creatures and bets (including the wild card) to best align.  Game play is quick, but not quite enough to remove the sinking feeling when you fall behind and are left waiting for the game to end.

One of the best card games I have ever played.  Every turn is tense (especially late in the game, when so few plays will end a round and kill a creature).

I originally rated this a 1, based on the completely unusable component quality of first Fantasy Flight version. Cards are both brittle and flimsy, and I cannot even slide one card over another let alone fan a hand of them. The new small box (tall/thin) edition has improved card quality, though it still isn't as good as a typical classic offering from Amigo (Space Beans, Gnumies, 6 nimmt) or Gold Sieber (Katzenjammer Blues, Money!) so if you are the type to sleeve everything or don't care about card quality - you might want to treat my rating as a 7.

This game started good and has just kept getting better!  It scales very well between 2 and 5 players.  It is a simple game to learn that plays quickly with a few tough decisions along the way.  The ability to make a secret bet allows for a great deal of bluffing and forces people to play along side others to insure different competitors make it to the end.  This is playable within thirty minutes and is a highly recommended game!

Update 6/6/05: This has quickly become one of my favourite games and it is tough to make it through a games day without this one hitting the table.  As we learn more about the character powers the better this gets.  If in six months I am still playing it, it'll have 10 as a rating from me!

Update: 12/31/06

I still love the game but with so many choices it hardly hits the table anymore.  Downgraded to an 8, but still highly recommended.

Betting Card Game created by Reiner Knizia. I don't use to like Betting mechanics, but this game is an exception. The great art, the feeling of being on a mythical colosseum, and the clever hand management just makes me love it.

Colossal Arena is a fun game of betting on different monsters who are battling to the death in an arena.  I think it is best with 2-3. although it is  still a lot of fun with 4.  One weakness of the game is that there is a decent chance that the deck will run up before the natural end of the game and although there are alternate rules to counteract that problem they do not work entirely satisfactorily.  Still lots of fun.

One of my favourite Knizia games, requires some tablespace, and not very intuitive (not easy to teach). Game mechanics work great on many levels - good amount of planning, interaction and gambling. Recommended with any number of players. I'd like to get the reprint someday.

RATING: 6.5
Simple to explain and quick to play so fits in nicely as a mid game sorbet. Betting allows backing of strong vs weak card suits and the abilities of the creatures pushes the game toward more skill than chance. Scales down well to 2 players. 

Just not good enough to justify a place in an overcrowded collection. Sold Jan 2012.

This game has a lot of tension. Keeping your bets alive is tricky, and requires correctly anticipating the actions of the other players. The monster special abilities add complexity without improving the game any, but are easily left out, as they feel very tacked on anyway.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a very good betting game, with interesting special powers, and where you feel like you're in some control.  :)  

For Colossal Arena, I thought I wouldn't like the additional contenders in the new edition, but I find them hard to distinguish, balance-wise, from the old monsters.  I really don't like the Ettin's art, though, and wish it were still the Hydra.  I just don't play with it, though, since there are plenty of interesting monsters around. 

Recently I traded away Colossal Arena and instead traded for Titan: the Arena.  It's come down in value since Colossal was released, but for clarity's sake I prefer Titan's design.  And I do like Titan's art better, even though I'm more familiar with Colossal.  Either way, it's a very good little wagering game.

Players will bet on fantasy monsters, using cards to decide who will stand at the end of the fight. VP are given if the bet can be collected for the choosen monsters are still alive. Simple rules, but a very interesting game where you try to screw other players pets, while keeping alive yours.
To add flavour, players can use monsters special powers. The new version add 4 new creatures, to be added to the existing 8. As you randomly select 8 monsters to fight it out, there are can a lot of combinations. This game plays fast, is cheap, is easily portable and is fun. A must in each collection, if you don't disdain fantasy theme.

It's a betting card game, plain and simple.  Only the cards are monsters and you get to place bets on who will win.  It's actually very entertaining, quick to play.  Makes a good start off game or a finish game when other end quickly.  Only resembles "Titan" cause of the monsters that are on the cards.  As card games go, this is fun!  Well, it was...$52 dollars was too much to ignore, I think I paid $15 for it new. Bought me a couple of games I think are more fun with it.  Thank the gaming gods for Ebay.  Update:  Just got Colossal Arena for, yep you guessed it, $15.

Interesting cardgame where players are betting on the outcome of battle in a fantasy arena. You have to balance early bets, which tend to pay out well but are risky, with late bets, which are less risky but also payout less. One of the few Knizia games where the theme actually seems to work.

RATING: 7
What I love about Knizia's designs is the fact that he does a brilliant job of simplifying without removing strategy. The simple play-a-card-draw-a-card mechanism of this game is ridiculously easy to teach. However the special abilities that players can use add just enough interesting decisions that I find the game really intriguing. I like the way that the players control the length of each round, and the game of chicken that starts when almost all the characters have an attack card. Our game dragged out perhaps a bit long because people seemed reluctant to end each round. We also didn't see any reason not to discard and draw as many cards as possible. This depleted the deck very quickly, so it might go a little differently in the future with more experience. If I were to make one complaint it would be the art and theme. It's fairly dark and serves as a pretty tough barrier to entry for non-geeks. I just can't picture pulling this game out with my parents or in-laws. However with the right crowd I think this could be an amazing game that I'd love to play any time.

I'd heard good things about this game, but never really looked into how it works.  It's classic Knizia, using a few suits of cards all numbered 0-10 with a couple specials in there and a few betting chips.  Fairly simply turns with fairly simple scoring and... voila, you have a fun game that's pretty easy to play but does require thinking.

[i]Titan: The Arena[/i] is by far the best of the three games using the same basic mechanic. [i][gameid=1367][/i] is just too plain without having to evaluate taking over the powers of an individual monster, and [i][gameid=718][/i] adds too much fiddliness to this solid game. I haven't tried out any of the new creatures in [i]Colossal Arena[/i] and think the new endgame rule is stupid.

I own a copy of both the original and the FFG reprint.

I forgot how cheap the cards in the original Silver Line box feel. Mine even are marked with a bunch of them having a small white mark on the backs of them. I will definitely use my copy of [i]Titan: The Arena[/i] over the newer version whenever I have a choice.

My most played game, and one of three that I rate as a ten.  Lots of tough choices - whether to attack or defend, save your best cards for later or use them now.  I always build up a great hand for the last round, and then it ends before I can play them. 

I like some of the new powers in Colossal Arena, but prefer the older version for the look and for the card quality (plus you don't have to sort the cards before you start playing).

Played it once and I liked it. The thing was, that the first you play this game it is really hard to know how to play well. There are plenty of acreature abilities, and it takes a while how to understand how to use these to best effect. That gave it a rather chaotic feel. I won, but I am not really cerain how or why I did that. With more experience, I am certain the game will fell less chaotic, and it will be much easier to see what a good move might be. If so, I think I will raise my rating of it.

Unthematic to the core despite the attempt at passing it off as a fantasy fighting game, Colossal Arena is nothing more than an icy mathematical exercise where, given enough thinking, unforseen events can be foreseen and countered: yet this is exactly what you have to expect when you play a game by a prolific author whose themes are nothing more than a fragile wrapping around his cold mathematics.

A solid entry by Herr Knizia.

3 plays.  Some redeeming qualities, but ultimately too chaotic for my tastes.  It's important to become a backer for 1-2 creatures at the start... otherwise, it's difficult and expensive to take over the backer-ship.

Wow, what an underrated gem of a game. This game speaks to what so many people praise in Knizia - a few intuitive rules with deep gameplay and engagingly tough decisions. The theme isn't too deeply infused but it doesn't matter. The game moves at a strong pace, seems light but offers the rewards of a heavier game in a small package. It also plays perfectly with three players (so many of my titles don't). For the price and footprint, I'd say that Colossal Arena belongs in far more collections than it actually occupies.

Much better than expected.  Players are gambling on which monster will survive 5 rounds of combat.  Each round, players place cards until all monsters have cards AND one monster has the weakest card.  That monster is eliminated.  Bets placed in earlier rounds are worth more than bets placed later.  Also, if you've bet the most on a monster when you place a card on it, you get to use its special power.  The special powers are what makes the game particularly interesting.  They increase replayability and thinking without being broken.  I played and enjoyed it with 5, although I hear 3 is better.

Comprado en pedido conjunto a Ludobay en Marzo de 2017 por 1.50€ (En realidad se pidió en Noviembre de 2016 y llegó a principios de Marzo).

Juego del estilo de Knizia. Sencillo de explicar y de jugar, pero con enjundia suficiente para que resulte entretenido. LA única pega que le veo es que ocupa mucha mesa, a pesar de ser un juego de cartas.

Es un juego de apuestas sobre "guerreros" que compiten entre sí. La historia está en apostar por los guerreros adecuados lo antes posible. Cuanto antes apueste, más valor tendrá la apuesta si el guerrero sobrevive. 
Además, si eres el jugador que más has apostado por un guerrero, cada vez que juegas una de sus cartas, puedes utilizar un poder especial que hace que el juego tenga variedad.

Dura entre media hora y tres cuartos y es perfectamente válido para no iniciados en el mundo de los juegos. Es una buena compra y una relación calidad precio absolutamente bestial (por lo que me costó...).

Lo tengo tradumaquetado con pegatinas sobre las cartas.

Monsters are not my delight, but I have some fun with this. My teenage sons really enjoy replays of this game, which turn out to be quite competitive, close finishes. I like the feature of the elimination of the monsters, which may force you to cut your losses while taking the most points away from other players. Nice amount of variation with the 12 different monster abilities makes for a wide range of variations in game play with only 8 of them chosen for one game. Rated for the three player game. Plays ok with four, but harder to plan.

It's a bit odd thinking of a Knizia game with such a strong fantasy flavour, but then the mechanics are pure Reiner, derivative of Loco! and Ra.  It's a great game, and I'd happily play lots of it.

This game has been a hit with the few groups I've played it with. There is a lot of messin' with the other players which, in the right group, is a lot of fun. If there are players who dislike this type "take-that" game, then avoid it. Otherwise it's a fun, solid game.

Lots of difficult choices, but sometimes your hand can be soooo bad. Interesting theme. Must try again. UPDATE: 4 -> 8. Our second game, with the correct secret betting rules (only in the first round!) was fantastic. The game is tremendously tense. It's sort of like Lost Cities, except you don't know which expeditions your opponent has started. We loved it.

Seems the special powers and secret bets took a fairly dull and uninspiring game (Grand National Derby) to a very solid middle-weight entry. Recommended.

UPDATE for FFG version: Most of the new monsters FFG added are lousy, but I thought one, the Gorgon, was OK. The Demon, sorry, Daimon, and Seraphim should be put into a garbage bin and burned. Also, FFG f*cked up the endgame. Play the original endgame rules (play until all cards are exhausted), the new endgame rules are terrible.

After a few plays, my initial rating stands.  It is a solid little betting game with interactions that that surprise me every time.  And it really makes you sweat, too.  You can be backed into some pretty tight corners and do the same to your unsuspecting opponents.  And yet, it seems there's a way out of every trap if you are clever enough.  I love this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pretty fun filler.  Bid on some monsters, and play some cards on them to determine which monsters survive.  The monsters all also have special abilities, which the players with the most value in bets on them can utilize, which provides a really nice twist on top of the card play.

Card play can be very tense, with players always unsure as to when a round will end, and which monster will get offed.  The player who placed the best bets and then positioned those monsters to win will be the winner!

Surprisingly overlooked here on the geek. Great game that combines investment risk with card management. I like the special powers in the FF version but the geeky re-theme unfortunately makes this a hard sell with family/non-gamers who I think would otherwise enjoy this game.

RATING: 8
The tension in this game is one of time. You have to commit to certain creatures, and the earlier you do so, the more points they are worth. However, so little information is known at the beginning of the game in terms of your potential to keep one of them alive, that committing early is the riskiest time to commit.

Also, due to the special powers, some creatures are more powerful than others, while this makes it easier to keep them alive, sometimes, it also makes them a bigger target for elimination.

However, there are a lot of turns in this game where I feel like my actions are rather meaningless. The beginning of the early rounds where safe cards are played. The early rounds if betless creatures get eliminated.

I was, surprisingly, positively surprised by this game – which is a bit unusual for me as it’s rare a cardgame really grabs my attention. But this is actually a very good little card game which features elements of bluff and betting. 
Winning scores aren’t big, so it’s almost crucial that your secret bet is scored; you get more points for that, and you can count the rest of people’s points, so you’re trying to eliminate those points – but you are never really sure which creature the other players have backed, so there is some “surprise” at the end of the game.

Now, speaking of this secret bet… It is a great feature of the game, although slightly random at the beginning of the game, and you can be a little unlucky to have your creature slained, but mostly you can keep your creature alive by skillful play. But you can also be out of the game for good if you put all your eggs in one basket (i.e. place a secret bet and a high bet on the same creature), and I don’t think I like this as it will probably either win you the game by a lot, or you will have no chance of recovering if it gets slain. In my third play I actually had to make a decision about which creature to kill; I had a much better than 50-50 chance of winning (not going to explain the math here), but chose wrong by pure chance and lost narrowly – that kind of sucks.

Sure there is luck of the draw – I honestly feel that I won my second game because I drew some awesome cards (both the 0 and 10 spectator cards, which can have a big impact on a given round) and a lot of highly numbered cards for my “own” creatures… And speaking of the creatures, I looove the fact that there are 12 different creatures with vastly different powers – but in each game only 8 are actually in play! This gives the game great variety. I think some of the creatures’ powers are better than others, but I don’t mind. Oh, and I actually like the retheme - I think this theme works well.

The game plays quickly over 5 rounds, and it gives me a very tense feeling as I’m trying to keep my bets (both the public known and the secret one) alive! It works great with 3 and is probably going to be my favorite number of players as you have a lot of control over the state of the game.

RATING: 6
Clever card game with good replayability due to the random monsters dealt for each game (8 out of 12). The usefulness of each special ability takes a while to sink in. A fairly simple game but with lots going on though not much control. Monsters need multiple backers to survive.

I want to play this game nearly every time my gaming group gets together. I love it! The only thing that keeps it from being a ten is when I think of trying to teach it to a new non-gamer (as that is mostly who I play with). They just can't seem to get it until a whole game goes by and then the game is over. However, with someone who knows how to play, this game is as fun as any.

Colossal Arena is a betting game that's longer than most fillers but doesn't take too much time to learn or play.  I feel that 5-player games are too chaotic--too many cards get put down between one's turns.  Also, I feel that this game is much more fun when played quickly.  Many people I've played with seem to take each move too seriously.

Excellent bidding game. Chaotic and random for a Knizia game but that's the fun of gambling. I've been very surprised by who does and who doesn't like this game. It's been almost the opposite of what I expected. Don't let anyone be put off by the theme.

RATING: 7
Titan: the Arena is a real oddity as it bears almost no relation to (a) its namesake, the game "Titan", and (b) its own theme.  I know, you're saying " a Knizia game with a tacked on theme?"*

But it works, once you get beyond the theme, and the unnecessarily convoluted rules.**  The basic mechanics are simple, but the interplay and the decisions to be made make this a great game once you "get it".

If you can't find TtA, try Colossal Arena, though opinions vary on the re-release's quality.

We have the Colossal Arena version and play 2-player.  The theme of the game really didn't grab us, but we kept hearing such good things and finally bought it.  The numbers-based gameplay is right up our alley.  Decisions are interesting throughout, and there are always several ways to attack the game.  There are a dozen card colors, so naturally some of them are quite similar.  The artwork makes these easy to distinguish once the cards are played, but that doesn't help while the cards are in your hand.

I really really like this game. Wait, I really love this game. People talk about games that they never lose? This is one that I think I have only lost once in about 8 plays with my game group. It's like it doesn't matter what I do, someone does something to kill off that last monster and somehow I'm declared the victor. On the other hand, my 11-year-old did beat me the time I taught it to him.

(Note: I have the Colossal Arena incarnation from Fantasy Flight games. The cards leave a lot to be desired. I can't stand the finish, or the thickness, or the stock they used on 'em.)

This rating is for the Fantasy Flight version.  Played for the first time, and found it enjoyable.  With four, the game ended by having the cards run out.

One of the better Fantasy Flight small box games, up there with Citadels.

~20+ plays... A great one... This mix of gambling, player competition mixed uncomfortably with teamwork, and monsters is a winner. Fun, tense, atmospheric game with the great combination of gambling and bashing... The theme reminds me of the classic Star Trek episode where the brains-in-domes bet "quatloos" over the gladiatorial battles of Kirk & Co. [ http://images.wikia.com/startrek/images/3/35/Thegamestersoftriskelion.jpg  ] This is a game where you get that tight stomach feeling of caring what happens. To me, for the price, gripping play and fun, I consider this a must-own. Truly great with spirited gamers who enjoy the rough boisterous play.

(Original AH Edition) 
A fast playing Knizia betting game that has special powers and a lot of screw your neighbour excitement going on. I love the way that all the different valued cards can be useable if one simply waits for the right situation. The turn angst on this is also excellent as it can be difficult to choose between helping yourself or hindering your opponent. Many temporary alliances will form as the bets come down, giving it more texture and the bluffing really works as well. I don't particularly care for the theme on this one, as it makes it a hard sell to non-geeks, but the gameplay is really high quality. The only minor hitch for me is that it really is best with exactly 3. If you have more hands in the jar the game just gets out of control. I still like it with 4 and in a pinch 5, but it's not quite as good with that many.

(Colossal Arena Edition) 
The new edition of the game is identical in most ways to the older one except in graphical design (harder to tell spectator cards), more monster variety, and higher quality cards (very nice). The new edition slows down setup time because one has to determine the monsters being used and sort the decks (either before or after the game), and as I referenced above, the spectator cards are not as easy to differentiate. One other major issue: the end game rules are altered in this edition, and I don't care for the effect. I would not play the game with these rules, and it would rate probably 1-2 points lower because of it, as the deck runs out almost every game, so the rule would be consistently pissing me off. Easy enough to play with the original rules though. I like this edition slightly less than the original just because of all of these minor niggles. The monster variety seems neat in theory, but in practice it just slows down the game setup and makes this title sound like less fun to pull out.

Knizia games, although typically interesting barring a few real stinkers, are seldom what I'd call a lot of fun.  Colossal Arena/Titan: The Arena on the other hand is a lot of fun, although as usual it seems like it's full of the same mechanics he uses over and over again.  Nonetheless, the game's a blast, there's lots of good strategic play and it's got a great potential for nastiness, which is welcome amongst all the "can't we all just get along" European games.  No, I want to see your Titan go down in the first round so you lose your 4-point bet!  Great betting game, the only one I own or need.

My rating is based on "Colossal Arena" by FFG. This is a great little betting game that plays fairly quick and is lots of fun. The art on the cards is excellent too. I find that Centaur to be just creepy!It is both nice and a pain that they added more monsters. I like the variety that each game can achieve. However, it is a pain to set up, as you have to choose the monsters that will be in the game and shuffle their cards together. If you decide to play another game then you either need to play with the same creatures or redo the whole deck. This can be tedious, but again you do get more variety over the old "Titan Arena" version.

Betting games are not my cup of tea, and I just could not be arsed to memorise the game actions based on the subject matter. In the end it is just a chaotic card game with shifting influences and quite a bit of randomness in the card draws. Although, knowing Knizia, there are undoubtedly ways around this apparent randomness. But I'd rather do a more worthwhile game of his instead.

RATING: 6
The problem with this is that it's really easy for the game to end in a situation where someone who is clearly out of the running for the win has 2 options on their turn, and they're clearly deciding who the winner is.

I do like Knizia's "ally with your opponent's" games; that said, Thor/Loco is a much better take on the style.

It's probably unfair to rate this game after only one two-player game, but here is a "benefit-of-the-doubt" rating.  I can only assume that this game gets MUCH better with more people playing because playing with only two really was entirely forgettable.  My 12-year-old described it as "boring" and he was right.

RATING: 7
Nice Knizia game.  I never played the game this was based on, without all of the special powers.  I suspect that the special powers over-improve the game; that is, the base game might have been a bit dull, but the powers as they are may add just a bit too much complexity for my tastes.  Nonetheless, I'll probably pick up a copy when the reprint comes out.

Update: I just picked up Colossal Arena.  I haven't played it yet, but my initial impressions are mixed: The artwork is nice, and the new powers could be interesting.  But the card colors are hard to tell apart, and although the cards are printed on heavy stock, they are uncoated and don't shuffle well.  Because of the black edges, I don't expect them to wear well, either.  Nonetheless, it is great to have this game back in print, and the price is right.

Fantasy creatures fighting it out like gladiators. This hits me in the solar plexus with its shere elegance in design. Who are you going to bet on? Who are you going to control? Only the last three creatures standing can share the spoils of victory. This made me want to watch
the movie "Gladiator" for the umpteenth time. This is a
great betting game and a definite Knizia classic.

Components: The card quality has been improved in the latest Fantasy Flight small-box edition. The creature art is wonderful (I prefer the cards in Colossal Arena to Titan: The Arena). I might like a cheat sheet explaining the various powers, rather than cluttering up every card with text.

Experience: Very interesting game, budgeting cards, using them to keep my creatures alive, activate special powers, tank other creatures, and to end a round. I enjoy how the equation gets simpler and simpler as creatures are eliminated. The variety of special powers can be overwhelming, but this gets easier as the creatures become more familiar through repeated play. I prefer this as a two- or three-player game, which feels more strategic, whereas with more players too much can happen in between turns.

Very clever game with a great theme and one of the most enjoyable games I've played where bidding is such a big aspect.  The game feels casual enough to not make you feel too bad about losing but you still care enough to where winning is satisfying. 
 I took points off because the game really demands 3 players - no more no less.  A 2 player game doesn't allow the game's mechanics to truly open up and 4 or more loses the tension because you can bid more safely.
All in all a great game that deserves more attention.

I was somehow disappointed in this classic Knizia game. Expecting some kind of multiplayer Schotten-Totten, the game had more similarities to Thor, another Knizia I don’t really ‘get’. I didn’t like the ‘discard worthless cards’ aspect of the  game and found it hard to predict other people’s moves. I also thought this game would be related to Royal Turf in some way, but I really missed the excitement which this latter is never lacking.

This is an excellent betting game with a lot of tactics and a moderate amount of medium-term strategy.  There's just enough unpredictability to keep the game lively, but enough control that the players can plan effectively.  It only misses the ten because it doesn't scale particularly well -- a two-player game takes a while to get interesting whereas a five-player game is far too chaotic.

Another Knizia game where the theme is loosely applied to the game. That being said, it is also typical Knizia in that it is a good game. You're placing bets and then trying to secure those cards that you bet on so they stay until the end of the game. Earlier bets provide more VPs than bets placed later in the game (risk vs reward). Each creature has a special "power" associated with it, in the form of card playing. Very simple turns (play a card, draw up to a hand of seven), but enough decision-making to make it interesting.

A fun card game. Challenging to explain & players need to familiarise themselves with the contestants & their powers. Attack with a contestant that you "back" to wield powers against your opponents. The betting dynamic means it is not always clear who is winning, especially if secret bets are not revealed until the end. This game requires a lot of space & it is recommended that the cards are carefully stored in their collective groups to make setting up easier.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A strange betting game. I found the low number of tokens really made placing bets a tough decision, especially given the low level of control. The round can very quickly end with your horse...erm...titan eliminated before it gets back to your turn. I'd probably enjoy it as a filler if it was a bit quicker. (Played both Titan & Colossal, but too far apart in time to notice the differences.)

I really love the card playing and the killing off of creatures.  The base game mechanic rules.  But you can be knocked out of the game early.  Games with VPs always have a sense of "I can come back if I stop him and play well".  But here, you can be absolutely out and have no reason to keep playing cards.  And the game isn't quite fast enough to get over that sense of elimination.

Avalon Hill remake of a German horse racing game.  Players are placing bets on the outcome of a battle of weird monsters and playing cards to influence the outcome.

Feels more like a presidential primary than monsters bashing each other, as a field of 8 is narrowed each round and influence on them is manipulated by various backers.
 
Beyond that though, this is a great design from a playability standpoint and I'll play if asked. Another base hit for Knizia, and even the guys at AH who tinkered with his design...

This is my regular for a four player who are not into games that much / do not have a whole lot of time situation. In round 3 or 4 you'll usually find me screaming "I dunno what to do, I dunno what to do, argh". As a rule I'll loose too. Nevermind. It is a great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It was intriuging. The kind of game you'd rather play more than once or not at all. If it was a regular to hit the table, it would move at a more satisfying pace - but even on the first play it wasn't too difficult to figure out. The fact that we came up with a tie (with an arbitrary tie-breaking rule) was a little disheartening, but nothing a house rule couldn't fix.

There seemed to be a pretty wide spread between scoring in our 4 player game, but that may have been due to inexperienced play. Some casual players may not like the "not in the running" feeling that may occur.

I found this to be a pretty fun game with lite-gamers.  It's not meaty enough for real gamers and the theme is a bit of a turn off for non-gamers, but with the right people its a fairly quick game with some decent strategy mixed with luck.  Plays ok with 2, is better with 3, and then gets a bit too random (but still can be fun) with 5 or more.

I usually do not like games with a slapped on theme but this is a great game. The theme and special abilities do add a nice flavor to this "mathish" game.

This is a current lunchtime favorite.  I find it incredibly dynamic for such a structured game.  There are no bad cards, only bad timing.  This game reminds me of Lost Cities in two regards: 1) it fundamentally involves assessing your ability to complete a series of numbers, and investing in that series accordingly, and 2) women routinely destroy me at it.  I think that with a "nicer" theme, this game might be up there with Lost Cities as an extremely female-friendly game.  But as for me, I still like the monsters.

Bought this on a whim, and have been consistently impressed with how good it is.  The more I play it, the more I like it.  It's interesting how both high cards and low cards are valued by the different players.  There's a good amount a tension here, and it only amps up as the creatures start dropping.   The wilds and referees really give it some unexpected twists too.  Great stuff.

Colossal Arena is basically one of the best card games out there in my opinion along with Citadels.

Secret bets in Colossal Arena are interesting in trying to keep the creature alive in the arena at the game end to get the extra points. 

Do you keep the secret bet hidden the whole game or reveal it at some point during the game to take control of the creature and become it's backer ? If you do, it has a higher risk of being a target by the other players.

Each creature has their own abilities which can affect the course of the game.

I enjoy using the cards and chips of Colossal Arena to play Flinke Pink. Flinke Pink is a great game which is a fast filler to play once in a while.

Points of interest for this game would the  bidding/secret bidding on your favorite creatures, using their abilities and trying to stomp the competition.  The hindrances would be that the game is probably to chaotic with 4 and 5 players, the Ettin seems too be too strong with a lower player count, and finally since you don't use the same creatures from game to game, there's a lot of sorting to do before putting the game away.  This seems like a lot of negative things to say but I still enjoy playing the game and it feels like a unique experience.

One of my all-time favourite card games, and one of the first games that tried succesfully to mix american "theme" and "Euro" concepts. Players are betters in a fantasy arena that try to let their supported monsters survive round after round of (abstract) mayhem. The game takes an interesting game concept by Knizia (originally used for a racing game) and spices it up with monster special abilities that make sense and don't destroy the game balance. The game plays quick and tensely and is exciting to the end. It is sad that a great effort like this was one of the swan songs of Avalon Hill, they could have continued in that direction!

Plays best with 3, there's more blood in battling. Ettin, Seraphim and Daimon have coolest superpowers. For some reason, Amazon has been usually the first to die in our playing sessions. Maybe amazon's superpower is not so interesting that anyone would like to protect it when there are better ones in play? Something unbalanced with superpowers, maybe? But it doesn't affect too much.

8 nasty critters battle it out until only 3 are left. Players place bets on them. Earlier bets are worth more, but are riskier since your favorite critters can be killed off. The player with the highest visible bet values of a given critter can use its special powers. Very good depth for such a simple game.

I own Titan: The Arena.  Not related to the better-known Avalon Hill game, except the creatures are the same.

Very fun game, but at the same time also 'Knizia-ly' brain-burning. There's a lot of thinking but also a lot of wheeling and dealing. I also like the theme, being an old D&D player, and the artwork and card quality is excellent. The endgame problems are already well-known but nothing that a tweak in the rules can't resolve.

RATING: 5
[2 plays] I was a bit disappointed on the thematic side, as this turned out to be more math than monster mayhem.  But my main objection was that playing with 5 players made it really random.  It was one of those situation where you just had no idea what was going to happen or what the situation might be by the time you got another turn--though it is a little bit interesting to try to manipulate the situation so that your goals will be accomplished for you by others who temporarily share them.  Anyway, the main way I'd be interested in playing this again would be as a 2-player game.  I think it would have a completely different character with 2 and might be more enjoyable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I think optimally this game should be played with 3 players.  That way, there's a less likely chance of teaming up as there would be for a more-player game, and it actually allows people to affect the outcome more before it's their turn again.

Last year I won Fairy Tale at the Geekway.  After finding it unsuitable to my preferences, I traded it away at this year's Geekway, and then won Colossal Arena.  God never gives you more multi-player, fantasy-themed card games than you can bear.  Knizia always give you sound mechanics, but I'm not too into short multi-player games.

I do like the flow of the cardplay though.  Positioning oneself to close out each round is the key, and makes for some interesting and not necessarily predictable strategic play.  The monster powers are too fussy, and I would like to toss them out, except that I suppose altering the importance of the betting decisions by removing the backing element would handicap the overall playability.  The theme is shopworn, but implemented in a rather bizarre fashion (I'm trying to construct a narrative about what is supposed to be happening, and failing).

A clever design in having players bet on the loser each round and seeing wins after all the attrition is completed over several rounds. There's some good tension as the betting chips are revealed each round. The problem is in how chaotic it can be and how out of it a player can be mid-way through. 

It's an OK filler from time to time. I just wish it were a little faster so knockouts wouldn't be so bad.

An excellent game all around.  Seriously, one of the best buys I've ever made.  Also, good for introducing people to games that aren't sold at Kmart.

Now that the new Colossal Arena version is available, I enjoy playing with the extra monsters. We tried a game with 6 players (using coins for the extra player) and it just didn't work very well. You have too little control of the battlefield with that many people. Stick with the game limits recommended by the gods.

RATING: 6
Can be frustrating that good plays just get blown away by other players doing random things.  In a multi-player version, building implicit alliances is much of the strategy.  In a two-player game thinking about the interactions of the special powers on "controlling" a creature make for an interesting game.

1/17 update: plays better with 4 than 5 players because 5 players exhaust the deck often after only eliminating two combatants (at least with this set of players), which triggers a premature end.  Maybe more advanced players would product a different outcome, but more concentrated interests produce more a "defend my combatant" style of play.

RATING: 6
Based on 4 plays.
+ An ok abstract game.
+ The more players, the more chaos. That's the way I like it.
- So, we have eight powerful creatures fighting each other in epic battles. I didn't consider it a battle but an abstract betting contest. In a sense, it failed my expectations.
- The distant theme doesn't help to understand the rules.

I own both versions. ** Titan the Arena: Whilst I took to this game easily, I'm not sure I'd want many plays. I think a lot depends on your very early decisions, and you cannot really recover from a damaging start. But I did like the mechanisms, especially the creature powers and I can see this being popular especially with RPGers and US gamers. It would seem to be a game that works better with more players. Nice graphics, poor plastic chips, on balance a good game. *** Played the FF edition Colossal Arena - usually US love of rules upon rules, but the game itself works well enough. We exhausted the deck by round 3 which says something to the difference in the versions. But we enjoyed it and think it would play much better with more than three players.

When I first saw the theme and artwork for this game, I didn't think it would be something I was interested in. Sure, the artwork was nice, but it's just that the whole fantasy, monster thing really isn't my cup of tea. Besides, I don't even drink tea. Anyway, after seeing that it was designed by Knizia and reading some of the reviews and the rules, I decided to give it a try. Great game. It takes some simple rules and only a few choices to make on your turn and creates a tense game of playing your cards at just the right time and knowing when and where to place your bets. Excellent game. 
Colossal Arena version. Not thrilled with the card quality though. The cards are sturdy enough, but don't have any kind of nice finish on them. Very difficult to shuffle.
Alright, that's it...after more plays I'm bumping this up to a 10. I absolutely love this game.

RATING: 7
[Hand management, Timing, Bidding, Fantasy, Card game] [5P:6, 4P:7, 3P:8] (These comments refer to FFG's 2004 "Colossal Arena" edition) It's unquestionably a good thing that some older designs are getting reprints - make no mistake. However, I wish that a bit more... I dunno, love?... had been put into this one. Would have appreciated linen-finish cards for one. And would it have killed FFG to come up with a decent insert instead of using their generic tray? This is a game that is a prime candidate for deck protectors. Once you sleeve everything, they no longer fit in the box unless you toss the insert (which I've already done). C'mon, if Amigo can put out a middling game like Bohnanza with nice production values, a top-flight game like Titan: the Arena should deserve something on par. Oh, the game? Best German bidding game I've ever played. However, for a card game it takes a significant amount of space, and there is a learning curve steeper than most of the simpler stuff. I'd say this is closer to a 45-minute mediumweight than a 30-minute filler. Don't let that deter you though; despite my bellyaching about FFG not meeting my production expectations, this is a title that a German game fan shouldn't at least audition for a spot in his collection. It's hugely fun, it plays fairly quickly, it's got both strategy and tactics, tremendous replayability, and it's simple once the players get a grip on the monsters' backer powers. It's not very deep, but for its play length it has more than enough meat on its bones. Highly recommended. But I'd still like some linen-finish cards... :(

Colossal Arena is a betting game. Players place bets on monsters, then - as the name of the game implies - battle it out in an arena by playing cards. When the dust has settled they score for bets they placed on those monsters still standing.

Both the premise and the rules are pretty simple, the most complicated aspect is having to understand the special abilities of the monsters. Placing bets is rather hard because there is only a limited number of betting chips and while early bets pay out better they obviously make the respective creatures much more of a target for other players. Additionally, even with only three players the game is rather chaotic.

 A thinly disguised horse-betting game wrapped in a fantasy arena combat theme.  But with clever (even elegantly simple) game play and betting that make for a pretty strategically compelling game. One that I find myself wanting to play pretty often.  I think the game plays best with three people. But I will say the dynamics and strategies required to win change considerably with the # of players.  The game also plays very quickly and you could easily fit a game or two in an hour.
 
 I love the individual powers of the creatures. The artwork and whole design is very slick and exudes quality.

Played 3-player--a cool game.  We were sort of stumbling through the strategy playing and betting willy-nilly.  I think my rating would rise after another few games.

I like the CCG-esque powers that try to reflect each creature fairly accurately.  Still, it will feel a bit pasted on to you, no doubt about it.

EDIT:  I like this game, but I'm not sure how I feel about it with five.  I think it's much better with three.  With five, there hardly feels like any control at all, and if you win, you just feel lucky (as opposed to 3 where you have quite a bit of control over what happens).  The board changes so much by the time it comes back around to you that you just sort of toss a card in and hope for the best.

I don't hate chaos like that, but when the game has such a precise betting system you want to influence things more.  You get that with 3; not too much with 5.  Still, more trash talking with 5, so that counts for something.

After one play most keen to play again, especially as I stuffed the rules and limited it to betting one chip per row! - the FFG silver line edition has good card quality, player aids and an excellent rule book for a smaller package - if only all games could be like this (rating 8: Jan 2014). UPDATE: I still like this game, but a few more plays makes it slightly less appealing.  Both games the cards ran out, so the end feels a bit flat.  Use of powers just doesn't seem to come as enough opportunity, and with 4 players, you don't sense you have a real control of the rounds. However, I still do like the game, and would be happy to play it, so ranking reduction to 7 (Dec 14). UPDATE Like the game theme, just the ending of it seems disappointing (Rating 6.784 Jan 17)

Was interested in this one, but kind of got inspired after playing Knizia's "King of the Beasts".  Actually, this is a very fun betting game by Knizia that is a lot easier than it first appears. High card / low card elimination and bets on what monster you think will survive by the end of the tournament. The real trick is to figure when to play a high card on a monster you want to win or a low card on a monster you want to lose. The extra powers spice it up and the alliances are helpful too. A simple game with the right amount of tension. Somewhat luck based given the cards you draw, but no biggie. Quite a nice card game.

Quick, fun, and intense betting game.  Lots of screwage, finger crossing and hoping you have enough time to save your beast.

UPDATE:  With other betting games more readily available (Winner's Circle, and Manila, e.g.) I have tired of Colossal Arena. Not that it is any means a bad game, I just find it fiddly and slightly long for what it offers.  I also have been witness to other games, such as those aforementioned, which really evoke a strong reaction from players - creating a much more engaging atmosphere, that Arena just doesn't seem to provide.  Yeah you sometimes get an exasperrated sigh and surly comment (all in good humor of course) when ones bid on a unicorn becomes moot, but it just doesn't excite like others do.  Lowered rating to reflect the absence of it's appearance at gaming nights. May rise again, but doubtful.

[b][i]Colossal Arena[/i][/b] is a fun Knizia card-game more reminiscent of his later designs that emphasize simple strategy, quick play, and a dusting of theme (contrast this to behemoths like Tigris & Euphrates, another 1997 Knizia design). The simple betting mechanics and quick play make this an enjoyable game. The easy rules and flexibility on player count make this a go-to family game. If you haven't played this I wouldn't necessarily recommend going out of your way to acquire Colossal Arena, but I would definitely recommend trying it if you had the chance.

Colossal Arena is enjoyable, has some interesting strategy, and is different enough that it feels very unique in the sea of other games on the shelf. There is just something a little off about it for me. Maybe the fact that playing it with 3 players you always have to make a choice of screwing over one opponent or the other with each play.

If you like to play the kinds of games where you play cards to stick it to other while bolstering your own prospects, then you'll likely enjoy Colossal Arena. T

his was our first time playing the game, so we spent a bit of time getting a feel for the game. And I must say the manual for this game isn't the best in the world. If you read the rules before playing the game, you'll probably have the same "Huh?" reaction we did. It wasn't until we actually started playing--placing our bets, playing our combat cards and using the creatures' special powers--that we began to understand what it was all about. 

Once you begin eliminating creatures, the lights start coming on and you begin developing a strategy to help you win. Placing secret bets are a nice gamble that can pay off with big points if your creature survives, but if it doesn't, you're probably on the losing end of the game with a card you might've played instead holding the bet. Granted, you'll want to use a card that isn't much use on the combat board anyway, but you're still taking a chance, which is what the game is about. 

Support the creatures you want to see win while trying to damage the others; that's pretty much the gist of it. It quickly becomes a game of one-upmanship, with the last card dealt often deciding the fate of many in the game. On the second to last play of the game, the creature on which I'd placed a secret bet was eliminated, thus wrecking my chances of winning, as I'd placed a number of bets on it along the way. The moral of the story is that it pays to diversify your bets to some degree, because if you throw all your support behind one fighter, it's all or nothing.

Like games with similar mechanics, the luck of the draw has a significant impact on what you can do, but you basically have to adapt your strategy to the draw. When the players really get into the game and start lashing out at one another's creatures while supporting their own, interest rises significantly. The enjoyability of this game thus hinges on whether you like this style of gameplay, which is in some ways is similar to Citadels, where your role may allow you to victimize another player. I guess we tend to like the "stick it to 'em" games, so we really enjoyed this one.

Colossal Arena is a fine game that I would certainly play again.

RATING: 9
This game provides a very satisfying mash-up of betting, bluffing, temporary alliances, screwage, timing, hand management, and tactical card play. For a light/medium card game with simple rules, there really is a lot going on - not just in the game itself, but also in the metagame. I like four players best, although many prefer three.

I emphatically recommend the Titan: The Arena rules which require play to continue for the full five rounds even if the draw pile is depleted (just play short handed).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a classic game and while a bit chaotic in terms of someone getting a nasty dunk on one of your big monsters occasionally during the game due to turn order, it requires some clever cardplay to stay afloat and win for the most part.

High screw-your-neighbor factor in this one with cool monster powers that you can tap from time to time. 
Plays fast and is lots of fun.

It reminded me a lot of Members Only, just more complex. There is good opportunity to mess with other players rather than just help yourself, and the special powers can help balance out bad card draws. Definitely good and deserves more plays before final verdict. *UPDATE* After another play, I like it more. I may have been looking for the wrong thing when I played it before. For what it is, it's pretty good. Interesting choices, multiple options, in a short amount of time.

RATING: 7
Like most Knizia games, it's pretty abstract, but the theme in this one seems stronger/more relevant, making the gameplay a bit more hot-blooded than much of Knizia's output.  

Or maybe I'm subjective because I like fantasy-themed games.

Simple set-up and mechanics, with each of the 12 creature cards having a distinct special power that breaks the rules in fun (and combo-riffic) ways.  Tense in that you only play one card a turn (normally) when you often want to either do much more, or play nothing at all.  

Placing visible and secret bets also makes it interesting and upps the "hose your opponent" quotient.  We haven't really done any suggested dealmaking in our plays (3 players), but with more players this makes it even more chaotic (a la Illuminati). Scales well for 2 to 6, and for casual/more-"gamer" gamers.

[2006/02/28] A betting game where players back monsters in some sort of gladitorial pit.  Monsters combat each other by the players laying cards numbered from 0 to 10 on each monster; high cards for monsters they're backing, low cards for monsters they want to lose.  There's nothing really wrong with the game, but it's a little too light for my tastes.  Short playing time.

This game is all about betting, with a very minor element of influencing the outcome of those bets. I like the variety the game offers, as only 8 of the 12 monsters will be used in a given game. However, the interactions between the chosen monsters don't seem particularly important, so the randomized setup is unlikely to influence your strategy.

Players will place bets on the 8 different monsters, but by the end of the game, only 3 will remain. Bets placed on defeated monsters are worthless. Bets placed in earlier rounds are worth more, and so the early game is the most important from a betting standpoint, with cardplay becoming more crucial in the late game as you struggle to keep the monsters alive which you have bet upon. Secret bets can be placed in the first round, and this is the most interesting element of the game; it creates tough choices later about whether to keep your bet a secret so players will not try to kill that monster OR to reveal your bet to gain control of that monster's special ability. 

The endgame can create situations where no player wants to play a card, and thus they simply run the deck out. Also, aside from the secret bets, all the information about bet values is open. As the secret bets are revealed, it becomes very calculable and can lead to some kingmaking. It's not the end of the world in a short filler like this, but I do wish there were a few more surprises at the end.

RATING: 8
A fascinating card-driven combat/bidding game, full of fantasy creatures, bluffing, and gambling. Knizia takes a what is essentially a War-like card game--it is a bunch of cards ranked from '0' to '10'--where only the toughest and shrewdest creatures survive, and manages to give it a "King of the Hill" or "Gladiator" flavor. Players place bets on specific creatures, hoping they will survive in the end, but also to take control and manipulate the creatures' special powers, which could significantly alter the results of combat and of bidding. Secret bets up the tension, as players could reveal their sponsorship of a single creature, and possibly take over control from another player. The game mechanics are simple, but it seems to require several plays before one fully understands and appreciates the game, as each of the 12 or so creatures has unique special powers. "Galaxy: The Dark Ages" is a more sophisticated SF treatment, but is also more cumbersome to play. Rating: '8'.

Update (01/07/11): Is it more like a game of "Chicken", where each player wonders who will blink first? If I play this card, then will you play that card? As the cards are played and slots are filled up, you wonder, will your sponsored creature survive the next card play? The slots can fill in suddenly, like a small line of dominoes. You could delay the inevitable, but only if you have length and strength in your cards, similar to bridge.

Played with 2,3, and 4 players.  Neat game with simple rules (although it takes most people a play or two to *understand* what's happening).  Scales pretty well too.  My biggest issue is that it seems the game always ends by running out of cards unless someone plays recklessly.

Just in love with games in this box size. They can pack a big punch. Unfortunately colossal arena, while a good game, is largely uneventful. Better after repeated plays, but not something ever gets played twice in a row. 

+Nice art

-Pretty abstract even with monster powers
-Not the clearest rules

I know you love Titan, if you don't slap yourself in the face and then go get some rangers.  CA is more of the same, a press your luck that meshes with the theme you know and love.  I played this one with Kate Perry and then she wrote that teenage dream song about it.
  Wanna screw your friends?  CA has an app for that.
  Wanna bet it all and lose but still win?  CA has an app for that.

Short to medium length, somewhat skillful multiplayer (2-5 players).

I'm liking it more each time I play it.  I find it difficult to win & that intrigues me & makes me like it even more.

Need to rewrite this.

A fairly simple betting game with a fairly high screwage factor. I don't really like games where you can be arbitrarily picked on by another player, you're simply not in control and the chaos gets worse with more players. Also, the creatures' special powers are very imbalanced, the one where you can recover a bet from a deceased creature seems easily the most valuable.

I think we do something wrong with this one. Our group has played this around 6-8 times and always ended up with rather unsatisfaying gaming experience.

Juego (filler- pesado) de apuestas. Tenso. Buena mecánica la de los poderes de las criaturas y su activación (ser el que más haya apostado sobre ella). Las cartas parecen ataques, aunque en realidad son una especie de “votos” para que la criatura sobreviva. Creo que mezcla bien competición y colaboración. Aún le quedan muchas partidas por delante. Pegas: Situaciones de kingmaker en el final de algunas partidas. En ocasiones, aleatorio: el ganador pensará que lo es gracias a su plan maestro, pero a veces no es así. El puteo es omnipresente.

RATING: 7
Yep, I got it. And although we play it quite often, I'm not sure how to rate this game. It does have its flaws, and I think the main reason why we like it anyway is that it has a certain atmosphere (definately added to by the awesome artwork on the cards). However, this game is so highly collectible that you should grab one if you still run across it.

We played this game on Dec 14, 2006.  It took a while to learn how to play and really understand what you are suppose to do.  It would be fair to say that this game was a learning experience.  The game itself is different enough from other games to incorporate into a list of games to play.

Very good game that scales well with any number of players. Good replay value. No complaints here. Players bid on a variety of gladiators over several rounds. Each round a gladiator is eliminated. Until the final round in which only 3 gladiators remain alive. Any money bet on defeated gladiators is lost. The player with the most money at the end of the last round wins.

RATING: 6
I had no idea what was going on in my first game until halfway through, and no idea on how to play effectively until the last round.  With that said, I really liked the premise and design of this game.  If you can accept having very little control over how the course of the game will play out (especially with lots of players) then this is a great betting fray.

Update:  Not sure why I had problems understanding the game the first time (bad rules explanation maybe?).  Anyway, I think the game plays much better and perhaps optimally, with three.  One fewer is boring and one more is too chaotic.

This game is kinda like that movie that didn't win any Oscars, but every time it comes on cable TV, you watch it for the umteenth time.  Very good game.  Quick and enjoyable to play.  I find it hard to pass up a game.

Found a great venue to play this one on-line: www.ludoholic.com (site now on indefinite hiatus) . . . although you miss the table banter when you play on-line.

In the same family as Galaxy: The Dark Ages.  Colossal Arena is a bit more streamlined, whereas Galaxy has a few more rules / ways to affect your opponent's play.

It is easy to learn, and one that I could introduce to someone who is not a board-gamer. I play with my wife and kids ages 7 and up. We all like it, and although many reviews said that it was confusing and hard to use a strategy with a lot of players because of random elements of the game, I disagree. It plays fine with 4 and 5 players. It like playing with 3 or 4 players best

RATING: 9
Wish I could get this to the table more. The fantasy theme puts some off, and all the special abilities prevent me from bringing it out with nongamers. But this is exactly the kind of "secret goal" game I love, in which you choose your secret goals, unlike so may game where you're dealt them from the start. 

I have the original Titan: The Arena version but have also played the FFG version and like them equally. The FFG version certainly has a better rulebook. (How often do you hear that statement :-) Man I need to get this to the table more.

This reminded me of Winners Circle quite a bit, betting on monsters(horses), some secret bets also, you help your monsters or hinder your opponents, mostly a gambling game with some screwage, these two things ensure it is fun.  

Update: Haha after rating this game I just tried looking up Titan the Arena and seen that THAT game was based on an earlier game by the Doc himself called "Grand National Derby". GND is a horse race that works very similar to this game except there are no special powers or secret bets. So essentially there are 7 of these games that are all very very similar with Winners Circle (aka Royal Turf which was also Turf Horse Racing) and Colossal Arena (aka Titan the Arena, Galaxy the Dark Ages, Grand National Derby) being the best of the bunch.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (June 2010)

Colossal Arena was one of the first games I ever played, however I never liked it much. I should have loved it but I never wanted to play it and I can’t say why not because the game is solid, one of the best of Mr. Knizia. Perhaps it has too much luck and chaos for my liking.

The rules are easy to teach and the game flows at a  quick pace. The art is good.

As I wrote before, the game has a lot of uncontrollable luck, it also features betrayal and “attack the perceived leader” situations, and I’m not too fond of either these days (although I was on 2010, that´s why I find it puzzling that I never liked much the game).

As my desire to play it again is very low, I played my last game years ago so I don’t remember all the game nuances. If and when I play it again I will come back to do a better comment.

Bottom line, fun  theme, but boring game for me. I hate most games in which all players attack the current leader and I´m not overly happy of playing betrayal games.

Colossal Arena's simple mechanics fuel a slugfest of supporting your creatures while trying to eliminate those of your opponents. The fact that multiple players can support the same creature adds elements of negotiation, alliances, and betrayal. The creature powers and variable creature setup add to the repeat playability, and yet something feels missing for me.

Light game of betting on who will survive an arena of fighting creatures. For such a distinctive theme, the game play is fairly abstract in the Knizian way. It's a fun game of trying to make sure your bets are the ones that survive from round to round. I played this with only two players, but I bet it would be more fun with more players since almost all creatures would probably have multiple betters having to work together when needed. My score could rise with more players.

RATING: 8
Put eight monsters into a cage and see who comes out on top! This has elements of chicken, take-that, and betting. It's easy to teach and has little downtime, so it can make a good gateway game for someone who may be interested in the theme.

I played this game with five players and it seemed too chaotic. There were just too many changes before your next turn. I would like to try it again with three or four players. Tokens are placed under a particular monster that you want to help survive so you will gain victory points at the end. Numbered cards are played with the highest valued monsters surviving the round. The monster with the lowest value is removed at the end of the round. Tokens decrease in value each round. If your tokens give you the highest value for the monster and you play a card to that monster you can activate a special power. In the first round, you can also play a token to a monster you select, but keep hidden. This one is worth five victory points which has a large effect on the outcome, but this decision is difficult to make in that round. This seems a little too chaotic, but maybe there is a good strategy for this. I will try the game again some time.

This game is a gem! It players 2-5, and is just as fun and exciting at 2 as it is at 5, although at 2 it's a fierice brain burner... or at least it is compared to the chaos of a 5 player game. It's great with both numbers, but certainly different.

Very fun, stab-in-the-back kind of light auction game.  I really enjoy the variety of creatures.  The two five-player games I played ended with five creatures remaining instead of three, so nearly all players were able to save their bid-on creatures, which was a very unsatisfying ending.  However, my rating of 8 is based on the game going to completion (end of the fifth round), which is nearly inevitable when played with the addendum rules (from the old Titan) provided by FFG.

If you want a game where betting is the central mechanic, but you want something with more control than Camel Up and more flavor than a trick-taking game, you are pretty much left with Colossal Arena.

It's amazing how much mileage you get from just a deck of cards and some chips.  I'm not a big fan of the fantasy theme, but I like how the game plays.  You have a lot of options on your turn and a bit of turn angst related to seeing how long you want to hold out playing your more powerful cards.

There's no great and special game mechanism here, but the theme is really cool and there's a nice feeling when playing. This is also a game in which you are eager to have a rematch after playing, which feels nice to me. Cons are a long setup time because some of the monsters are left out and in the end there may be a slight feeling of kingmaking when someone who has already clearly lost is just trying to gather as much gold as possible and while doing so aids someone really heavily.

Colossal Arena is a very fun and very nasty card game by Reiner Knizia. You are betting on mystical creatures fighting against each other as gladiators. A round lasts until at least one card has been played for every creature, then the one with the single lowest card is eliminated (and with it some player's chances of winning might go do the drain at the same time). Play continues until all but the fighters have been eliminated. I can't really explain why but I get a kick out of this game and enjoy it very much (even when I lose very badly).

Usually, theme in betting games is nothing that can surprise you. Usually. Colossal Arena attracted my attention almost immediately, as it involved in betting which mythological creature would beat the others to pulp. While it plays like an abstract, the theme is plausible enough to make rules intuitive.

It can be fun with any number of players, but it's borderline chaotic with five, while its pace is a bit too slow with just two. It hits the perfect spot with three or four.

The game offers a nice balance in between tactics and deduction. Maybe a bit on the light side for its length, as it rarely hits the table. Yet when it does, the experience is usually positive.

D'habitude, je ne suis pas fan des jeux de R. Knizia, souvent trop abstraits, un peu secs. Celui-là échappe à la règle. Les illustrations sont splendides, les mécanismes simples et intelligents. Le but du jeu est simple et tout s'inscrit parfaitement dans le thème du combat de monstres dans une arène (le thème parfait pour motiver mes deux fils).

Usually, I don't like so much Knizia games, often too abstract, too harsh. But this one is different. Illustrations are splendid, mechanisms are simple and clever. The victory conditions are simple and fit well with the theme : monsters pit fighting (the perfect theme for my two sons).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
As a gladiator is eliminated each round, you can cut the (pleasant) tension in this game with a knife.  The simple mechanism has a few twists.  For example, it's not long before you realize that, somewhat counter-intuitively, it is better to have low cards than high cards.  If you don't like confrontation and screwage (I do) then this is not the game for you.

Great card game, though the troll's rejuvination seems to make him almost impossible to kill, if the troll player (person who bets heavily and relies only on the troll) kills off the few other creatures with dangereous abilities on time, and not everyone playing their cards right. Most people just seem to gang up behind the troll anyway. still a solid game with lots of surprises. at the end though, it really boils down to who has his turn when. just a minor issue if you played your cards right in previous rounds

Gut-wrenching game that forces one to make decisions about which monster to place bets on. The basic choice is should one try to keep up with the other players making  a lot of early bets or save tokens to place in the more reliable later rounds.  Manipulating the monster powers lends the game some tactical depth.  I prefer to use the original rules for the endgame as the game loses its tension if more than three monsters are standing when the deck runs out.

Packs a lot of fun into 30 minutes.  Great theme, intuitive mechanisms and the design isn't similar to another card game I can think of.  This has got a bit of everything:  risk and reward, special abilities, cool art.  

Caveat:  I have only played with 3 players, and I suspect the game may be too chaotic with more.

One thing I don't like is that after a creature dies, its non-playable cards are still in the deck.  Sure, you get to discard 3 per turn if they're useless, but it's still annoying when you draw them.  I guess you could pause after each round to pull out the dead cards and reshuffle, but that, I think, would needlessly delay this quick game.

UPDATE:  6 ---> 5.  Just had a game effectively broken by use of the Magus card... playable creatures were cycled through the deck, leaving us with a empty deck and a discard pile intermixed with dead creature cards and live ones.  We didn't bother to reshuffle it.  Points to yet another flaw in a system that should be much more streamlined.

The fights are quite direct, and I enjoy this kind of direct confrontation--which is quite refreshing, after playing some less confrontational games like Agricola or Race for the Galaxy.

It's also a very dense game, in terms of the thinking power you can invest in it, with two players (there is not much chaos, and you can really devote a lot of time to pondering options)--it felt much denser than Agricola, where the exact effect of your actions are sometimes hard to quantify.

That said, the last round feels quite random, as the creature that will be killed is likely to decide who is going to win, and it is not so easy to get prepared for this last round.

Having a game in one's collection with wagering/betting and variable player powers is also interesting.

The (Ubik) box is easily carried everywhere. The gameplay is different with 2 players and with 3-4 players, which adds to the re-playability.

With 3 players, 2 players can gang up against the 3rd one: 2 players solves this problem, and maybe 4.

Victory depends on your ability to tie your fate to that of another player.  Since we usually play with 3 people, that causes a play problem.  With a larger number, this game would probably work better.

RATING: 9.5
This game is awesome. At first you might think it's one big gamble, but it's not. At the start you have to make some choices that feel random but for the biggest part the play after that is based on those choices and the ones the other players made. 

With 2 players it's very tactical, the control is much bigger than with multiple players. With more people you have to assume certain moves from certain players based on their bets. It can become a real brain breaker, so it's not really a family game. The theme is pretty basic but still mythical enough to visualize the arena battles !

This game goes deeper than it looks, I recommend this game to any self claimed boardgamer !

The game doesn't have the "Wow!" effect but it's quite nice. Nicer than I expected. During the first two rounds of the first game there was lots of confusion because nobody really knew what to do. In subsequent turns, and I suspect in subsequent games as well, Colossal Arena showed its true, fun and smart nature. The mechanics are very "Knizian" as usual. A combination of risk and hand management, using various special powers (they're incredibly well balanced, I must say) a bit like in Blue Moon and playing cards a bit like Loco!/Thor.

RATING: 7
The take that card game is a tricky design task. Tilt too far one way and you have a chaotic mess, tilt too far the other, and you have s tifled, unfun slog. Arena tends more toward the latter than the former, but the positioning and hand management elements add enough to keep the game fun. I do wish that the pacing were just a bit flatter, though. The first round seems a tad too long, while the last couple of rounds sweep past in an awful hurry.

On the whole, though, this is by far the best take that game that i have played, and I suggest it on occasion.

RATING: 7
Interesting bidding game.  The various creature abilities really make the game fun and interesting.  That you only use 8 of the 12 per game though makes reshuffling the deck between plays a rather large enough anoyance that you probably won't play it consecutively often.  I like having aditional creatures so the games are unique but for that cavete.  Bidding chips are a bit bland in design but they are sturdy so they hold up to being moved around just fine.

This game centers around timing and bluffing.  Card play is simple, but only the last card played in each category counts once the round is over and players have control over when the round ends, so if you play awesome cards too early then your opponent may play a card that "overrides" yours.  This is a betting game, but you can influence success of your bets through bluffing and timing in card play.

I have only played the Colossal Arena version, but have found it to be an excellent game.  I like the secret bidding aspect.  The end game rules seem like they were better in the original edition.  It almost always ends on exhausting the deck if you have 4 or 5 players otherwise and ends too soon.  Better to play with the original rules.

Card game working around bets. You have a set of monsters, which you bet on (trying to guess the last one standing). During the game, each player will have to use cards to modify each creature's values in order to facilitate their own "champion" (either by making it stronger, or by making others weaker).
Would be a much better game if it wasn't slow as sh*t.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Had this a while but just got it to a test play. Looks like an ok game with plenty of opportunity to mess with opponents. Rules are not really complicated but also not really clear as printed. see to be in the wrong order needing to tell you what you are trying to do rather than some of the stuff it is telling you. 

So essentially you are trying to pick which 2-3 monsters are likely to win a free for all battle based upon 8 cards you have been dealt. For example if you have a few high number cards of one type that might be a good candidate to pick. There is a secret bet you can make within the first 6 or so cards played but this 'wastes' one of the cards you are trying to keep in selecting it. So you bet on monsters - the earlier you bet the more the bet is worth - and play a monster card face up to the current row. When a whole row is full and there is a clear loser then that loser is turned face down and is eliminated and you move to the next row. This continues until 5 rows are done. You can only play a secret bet when the first row is still active.  There are some extra rules like that you can play eliminated cards over the top of active cards in the current row to neutralise a good card (or save a bad one). The cards also have powers that activate when you have he most visible bets on them. So lots of variability. Now to see how it plays with other people...

Standard not-very-interesting Knizia. Bet on things (early for more points, later for more certainty), all the while trying to exploit a limited number of card abilities for maximum effectiveness. 

It's certainly better than some other card games, but it also never feels like anything exciting is happening. The theme is not a good fit; this doesn't feel like an epic monster battle at all (10 go in, only 5 come out... wait, 5? that's not very much slaughter).

Colossal Arena 2004. Got it because I enjoyed playing Galaxy. Initial impressions:

- I'm not impressed with the cards. As usual, producers went not with a tried and true such as glossy coated linen finish, but with some wacko stock/coating combination. The cards are a bit too thick with only a dull aqueous varnish. This makes them difficult to shuffle and handle.

- you play 8 of the 12 provided monsters. I get that more are provided for variety, but I'm annoyed at the thought of having to sort cards before playing each game, which means MORE touching of the icky-feeling cards. Plan for now is to separate after each play, and keep each monster and its cards in its own little ziploc.

- Very nice art and I don't mind the subtle color variations between cards. The box, insert, and chips provided are more than adequate as well. The betting and turn summary cards are a thoughtful inclusion.

My opinion has changed with more plays. For two players, the one with more luck will win the game. It is frustrating when you get all the dead creatures in the later rounds, I don't understand why you cannot discard them right away. I see no strategy in this game anymore... if both players use their powers well, the game is down to who gets the right cards.I don't think I'll be playing this one again...It also is too long for what it is. It should take 15-30 minutes maximum...

After more play, I think this one really has some ugly king-making issues only slightly alleviated by secret bets. 

------------
A nice, tense game wherein players bet on monsters for two purposes: first, the ability to collect money if the monster survives the game and second, the ability to use the monster's power.  Standard Knizia with the "simple rules, deep game" and "you won't know how to play until after at least your first game."  Not a super deep game, but a reasonable, even heavy medium weight.

Cardstock is fairly terrible.  More companies should print cardgames on proper playing cards, like those found in Bohnanza.

2-5p, 45m, Reiner Knizia.  Originally interested as an alternative/antidote to CCG play.  One similarity (aside from fantasmagoric card "art") is the special text on the cards steepens the learning curve. making it not so fun until a few games are under your belt.  Also, the theme vs. mechanics is a little awkward to explain.  Even the rules themselves don't do a good job of explaining "why" you are laying down cards.  The cards aren't damage--they are more like votes.

Turn angst city. This game is a thing of beauty, all about metagaming, risk-taking, and making an agonizing decision every turn. The variety provided by only using eight of the 12 creatures is excellent -- and some of the combinations that pop up when specific monsters show up together are real game-changers.

It's more involved than the box size and components suggest, although it's not complex -- there's just a lot to think about while you play. I find Colossal Arena incredibly satisfying.

Not quite sure what to make of this one. My initial impression is that it's pretty good - it seems to balance the level of skill and chaos well, has nice elements of bluff and timing, some cool special creature powers to add variety and, maybe best of all, an interesting collusion vs competition mechanic when players bet on the same creature at different levels. It's possible that longer term it'll prove there's not enough player control but hey, it's short, so that's probably forgivable.

Buckets of Theme, interesting mechanics even if they are not always my favorites (bluffing and betting). The rules make it seem more complicated than it is, although it can take more than one playing to become adequately familiar with the creaters and powers. Ultimately it is one of the most best, and most unique, card games available. Inexpensive too! Plays well 2-5, best with three.

Yep.  It's a Knizia game.  Like every Knizia game I've played, that means that it's okay.  I enjoy it while I'm playing it, but it doesn't wow me.  I never particularly [i]want[/i] to play it, but I find myself thinking that if I gave it a couple more plays I might enjoy it more.  But that never seems to happen--I always have better games available.

I expect this to sit on my shelf for 8-12 months, when I will say "might be good with more plays, but I never end up playing it, so out it goes."

(And, in fact, that's exactly what happened.  Wouldn't mind playing it again if someone else wants to, but wouldn't say "let's play Colossal Arena!")

A great game of bluffing and strategy. Haven't had a group yet not like it. I am particularly bad at it due to not being able to read into the cards as deeply as I would like to--or maybe over-analyzing it altogether.

A nice enough game, but a tad clunky compared to more recent RKnizia games.  It's not a "light" filler, but a "thicker" filler game.  Production values are really nice, which makes the game easy on the eyes.  Learning curve is fairly steep at first, since there are lots of things to consider, but the pace quickens as the rounds go by.  This is one of those games that need multiple plays to really figure out what to do.  Unfortunately, with so many other gaming options, playing this one over-and-over to dig out the nuances isn't terribly attractive.

RATING: 5.5
Game in a Nutshell:  Place bets across eight mythical creatures then play numbered cards on them to represent battle until, one by one; they’re whittled down to where there are only three left standing that will pay out to their backers.

Played as:  3,4,5 player

Pros:  The game certainly has that Knizia simplicity... place a bet, play a card, draw up to eight cards... it’s basically that easy.  Probably the best concept for a betting game: an old-fashioned Gladiator style death match with mythical monsters. The best part is the interaction that comes when bets start to cross, forming these sorts of coincidental alliances among players with shared interest in common monsters.  This creates an atmosphere that is ripe for both camaraderie and trash-laced table talk... and often both of those with or against the same person only moments apart.

Cons:  Same-y. In an age where Cosmic Encounter, Small World, and Dominion have a "million" different interchangeable parts, only having 12 different monsters (of which you’ll set aside 4 in any game) doesn’t really feel like variety anymore.  On top of that, those monster specific powers aren’t anything to get real excited about (draw 3 cards, play go fish with your neighbor for a single card)  It takes effort to hold onto the sense of theme through some otherwise abstracted game mechanics. The game is at its best when it becomes vocally interactive, but standing in the way, is how players will struggle to get a grip on the different powers (which don’t seem to hold any relevance to whatever creature they may be) while reading and rereading the same card text ad nauseum.

Other:  Since the basics of the game are fairly simple, I can see this game as being very group dependant. Heavy trash-talkers / meta-gamers should love it; quiet contemplative types probably won’t. Those in between? Well... mileage may vary.  I can see why playing with less people might appeal to some in order to have more controlled environment. However, I much prefer it with more to allow for more of that intertwined interaction and to reduce the likelihood of one player getting left out on their own- being the sole backer for a creature which then becomes an easy target.  It took me a few plays to see any beauty in it, and I’m still not that excited about it. Perhaps that’s because I still haven’t come to grips that this game is less about the excitement of monsters "fighting" and more about where you diplomatically place your bets.

Best Use:  Ideal as a loosey-goosey game for those who aren’t afraid to interject their own interaction.

Very fun light-medium strategy card game which is themed fairly well for a Knizia creation.  Players bid on which creatures will survive 5 rounds and then use the cards in their hands, good timing and a bit of bluffing and luck to manipulate the outcome.  There are player powers but they don't come in too often and when they do they aren't powerful enough to detract from the game.

There's fun potential in this Knizia bidding/calculation-based game.  Came out a while ago, too.  Could be a solid 6/7, however the fantasy monster theme is just too blase -- can't stand it.

Based on only 1 play. Ok, there are some strategies and tactics that I probably didn't get on my first play.

I see some promise, but so far is the worst Knizia game that I 've played.

PROS
- The basic rules are simple. The game's still not great for beginners, as they have to remember the special abilities, but it isn't too complicated.
- Good replayability as some fighters are not used in each game.

CONS
- Bluffing is essential, so if your players don't like it just pick another game.
- Not a great game for non-gamers, but probably too simple for gamers, which leaves it in an ackward position.

This feels a little long at 45 minutes or so, but I imagine experienced players could crank this one out a bit faster. Despite the chaos, there's some interesting stuff going on, at least with three players. I can see the control whisking away pretty rapidly with more players.

Regardless of how anyone feels about the game itself, this set of cards (12 "suits" from 1 to 10) is invaluable for its ability to play several other games: Coloretto (Creaturetto?), Battle Line, Parade, Lost Cities, and En Garde.

I enjoyed this. It's a heck of a lot better than Cheaty Mages, which sort of covers the same theme, but in a far more random way. There's still luck of the draw here, but you usually have some options open to you. I like that players are encouraged to go after the same monsters just so no one can take advantage of their abilities. I thought the game play was okay, but I'd like to play it again a couple more times before I come to a final rating. This game is incredibly simple, but there's some depth in balancing your options based on the cards in your hand. A pretty fun filler game.

UPDATE: A little too long and repetitive to stick around, though I probably wouldn't turn down a game if asked.

A Knizia game where creatures duel it out with cards. Bet on creatures to earn points if those creatures survive. High cards are just as useful as low cards and creature abilities add a neat twist. Our gaming group usually plays the game a number of times equal to the number of players to balance out who gets to bid first on a creature. Playing multiple games usually takes 2-3 hrs. Very good game. I own the Titan the Arena version.

In Colossal arena, there are 4 new creatures that are added: 1) Seraphim which lets you use abilities of dead creatures, 2) Colossus which lets you recover bets made in previous rounds, 3) Gorgon which lets you name a creature card and take from one player, 4) Daimon, which allows you to bet multiple times in a round. So you can mix and match creatures with this re-implemented version. Note also there is a major rule change from Titan: The Arena, in that the game ends when the deck runs out.

I must say, after hearing people go on about this one at BGG, I expected a little more. Some of the creatures powers seem to have too great an effect on the game, and I found the play in general to be a bit too chaotic for my taste - often I found myself unable to do anything much to save my creatures, because of bad hand draws. 

Perhaps most damningly, it totally fails to deliver on the premise of monsters fighting in an arena. When I played, I felt more like we were headmen quibbling about which monster to execute. There is very little drama here.

Didn't feel like there was much strategy to be had here, though I loved the monsters and artwork mostly. It was very tactical, and it was also a little random what your opponent might play, though maybe I just suck at this game.

Reiner Knizia has been accused of creating games with mechanics, but weak connection to their theme. Colossal Arena is a good example. It is a game where you bet on monsters fighting a tournament of gladiatorial battles and play cards to give your monsters an edge in the hope they win. Sounds neat. In execution, game play is a dry affair of cards and tokens that do little to evoke the drama and action of the theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A betting game where people place bets on what three creatures will be alive at the end of the game out of the eight that start.  If you are the person with the most money (bets) placed on a certain creature, when you play a card on that creature you get to use it's special ability.  

The game goes kind of slowly for my taste and the creatures abilities are not all very interesting.  On top of the abilities not being all that interesting, the few and far between times that you get to actually use an ability, they prove lackluster once again.

I really wanted to like this game, but with the slow play and the kind of blind-betting that happens (well...I certainly HOPE I can keep this creature alive), the saving grace of the game (creature abilities) ends up annoying you further.

Auction plus area control type mechanic. You need to be able to make your warrior stronger plus play damaging cards against your opponents. If you make it obvious what you are trying to help win, you're bound to get attacked. The randomness of the cards you get really makes it so you can't really do what you want. It's very easy to get kicked out, and the winner will be the person who manages to consolidate all of their bids on one of the monsters that survives.

Comment for 3 players: Players control monsters that battle each other and you try to guess which 3 will survive out of 8. Intresting mix of card playing and using monster's special abilities. A very good game with 3 but might get too chaotic with more.

Comment for 4+ players: Yes, A lot of chaos with 5 players. So much that I'm not too eager to try it again with 4+ playres anymore. Rating 5.

E' il precursore di Galaxy: The Dark Ages. Esiste una versione in italiano che consiglio visto che su ogni carta è bene comprendere il beneficio della 'creatura'. Risulta un tantino più semplice di The Dark Ages e forse, visto che è un filler, è meglio così. Da il meglio di sè in 5 o almeno in 4 giocatori. Le partite iniziano con una prima fase lenta per poi accelerare improvvisamente. Il regolamento in italiano è ripetitivo e su molti punti vago. La fase 'scarto delle carte' non mi convince e rende spesso le partite troppo corte a causa della fine prematura delle carte del mazzo; personalmente aggiungerei la house rules di scartare al massimo solo una carta per turno. E anche il finale risulta troncato. A mio avviso bisogna un po' aggiustare alcuni aspetti ma il gioco rimane godibile.

RATING: 6.8
Frankly, this is another beautiful Knizia game. A modicum of theme does enough to complement a rock-solid brain-burner in card management. It excels with two or three players, but more than that would be a little too tough. The artwork is striking and elevates Colossal Arena above your average small-boxed card game. My one concern would be the possibly unavoidable kingmaker problems near the end when playing with 3.

One of my favourite games. We play it very often. I own both versions, Titan: the Arena and Colossal Arena.

There is a lot going on here, though the round-to-round action is very simple. Typical Knizia card game. It was great with two. I do think it would be tough to convince me this was worth the extra fiddliness, setup, and rules overhead compared with something like Lost Cities or Battle Line. The theme is definitely a bit stronger though.

Having played with 5, I do see the value in this over Knizia's strictly 2-player offerings. Lots of ganging up, temporary alliances.

The years haven't treated this kindly. Your VPs come from bets on which colours / creatures are going to survive, the earlier the bet the more VPs you make but the bigger target it is for players to kill it. Having a creature survive is a matter of making sure that when every colour / creature has a card (valued 1-10) below it, your colour isn't lowest. Playing cards in your colour give you a power ability to mix things up, move / reclaim / etc cards, which means some colours are more targeted than others. It eventually comes down to a meta-game of semi-alliances in an attempt to keep your strongest cards until later when alliances crumble. And that's the game - bet in colours others want to keep, play as low as possible as long as you can and table-talk it like crazy, hope that others get ganged up on rather than you. Playing the player isn't a favourite genre of mine, and there's not much else to offer here, so it's a game I now pass on.

Once again... too much fuss about a game that has got a name: Reiner Knitzia! It's a very luke-warm game, it's not bad, but it doesn't make me cry for more either. There is not much thinking involved and also the bluff is based mostly on speculations rather then the possibility to play on accurate and true variables. Somwhat disapointing! but ultimately it was worth it, since I traded it for Lord of the Rings (also Knitzia! at least this one is as good as his fame implies).

Very underrated Knizia masterpiece. It is great as 2-player game. Gameplay is very tense, every move matters. When you well know special abillity of every creature, the game becomes less random than it looks like at the beginning.

A cool wagering game that consists only of cards and tokens.  It is not as light as its Geek rating indicates. Creature special powers, spectator cards, secret bets, prefect and magister cards all add chrome, interplay complexity, and strategy.

This is a betting game where you bet (secretly or not) on certain races, and then play cards to help those races survive to later rounds.  Whoever has the most valuable bet totals on the surviving races wins.  While the races did have special abilities, the whole game seemed a bit dull and pointless to me.  Also, players can find themselves completely out of the running in the mid-game, if their big bets get eliminated early.

The game itself was quite good. I enjoyed the playoff-like rounds and the betting aspect. Five players were definitely too much for this, but anyways, it doesn't change the thing that the base mechanics were fun enough.

Would definitely play this one again, but more likely with less than five. Probably one of the best Silver Line games from FGG.

Update- I've played 3 games now (all 3 player) and this game is one of my favorites of the past year.  The theme is great and the rules are simple but allow for a variety of strategies and lots of replayability.  This has bumped off Battle Line as my favorite Kinzia game.

Clever, but FFG & AH ruins it with the stupid theme.

RATING: 6
It's okay and comes with enough replay value it's worth picking up if you like it. That said I haven't touched it in years and don't expect I ever will again; too many other card games that do bluffing and/or hand management better than this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Fantastic game.  Just enough bluffing and tactical play.  I prefer it with fewer players, as that offers more control and extends the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.75
I've only played with 2 players.. So, my comments and rating are from that viewpoint and I'm hardly a seasoned player of this one.  However, I've had some fun every time.  I feel that some of the monsters are stronger than others, but then, so what?  That means, either back them or beat them!  Only wussies lose! :)

When do I play this?:
Not too often - usually only if there's about 2 or 3 of us and we want to play something quick.

RATING: 6
Pretty fun, but I like Epic Duels more for fighting.  Being the spectator only loses to being the contestant.  A lot of times two people can kind of work together to screw over everyone else, then just have to persuade others to help them win at the last couple of rounds.  Sometimes more of a barganing game than a battle... maybe that's what rigged fights are like.

A great betting card game. Clever play and longer term planning let your fantasy creatures survive to the end of the game and bring you victory points. Strategy and decision making are not perfect or precise, so winning depends on who makes just a couple of better choices. Highly entertaining.

Another interesting pseudo-auction game, which plays quite interestingly. You are placing bids each round on different monsters, and giving these monsters battle ratings. At the same time, when a round ends (when all monsters have cards and one is the lowest) a monster is killed off, and after five rounds, only surviving monsters pay off. So it becomes key to keep your bets valuable, and push your opponents off the brink.

Fun Fun Fun.  Relatively easy to explain, relatively good for travel (just a deck of cards and poker chips).  Bid/auction for control of creatures special ability, but win based on how much money you're able to keep alive.  Games run just about perfect length. Plays very well with 3 and up to 5-6, I think.

RATING: N/A
I created a homebrew retheme based on the 2012 GOP Presidential nominees, because my friends are the type of people who would never play a game about betting on monsters but might play a game about betting on politicians. Plus, it doesn't feel like the monsters are actually fighting just by playing numbered cards, whereas changing the nominees' values feels more like jockying for political positioning. Haven't gotten a chance to play it though.

Best with 5P -- Good with 3P, 4P.
Best with 3 Players?  Not in my opinion.
This game is a negotiation game and for me a 5 player game is far superior as you are forced to make alliances to keep the creatures you are backing alive.  A 3 player game plays much differently as players simply rely on their own cards to achieve their goals.  
In TITAN: THE ARENA, players play till only 3 combatants are left.  For me, that makes for a more exciting game and I would suggest house ruling that rule into Colossal Arena.
One of my favorite games of all time.  It's just way more FUN than most - as long as everyone honors their agreements.  :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Good card game where you bet on various creatures and then try to keep them from dying over 5 rounds by making sure they don't have the lowest value card next to them. Ending can be a bit strange as once the cards are gone, the game is over.

I found Galaxy: the Dark Ages to be much more intense.  And I hate the way the FF version ends suddenly when all the cards are drawn.

Played 2P once at Card Kingdom (2012-06-24). The game took too long for what it was, although we felt some good tension towards the end of the game. On the 4th round, we had a nice fight over the Amazon which lead to us ending the game by running out the deck.

It was an interesting game and I'd play it again. It worked well for two.

My wife didn't care for the game, so I lowered my (our) initial rating to a 5.

RATING: 7
I'd actually give the original AH game a 6, and the fantasy flight reprint a 7.  Frankly, I found the AH edition to be a bit confusing, and it wasn't until I read the revamped rules and played the FF version that the coolness of this gem set in.  It's really quite a clever game, it's easy to teach, but there's tons of tactical decisions you must make.  The fact that the FF version has 4 more monsters is great as you will probably never have the exact same set up twice.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I stayed away from this back in the day when I liked Titan but wasn't too crazy about it being "turned into a card game, with no dice". I finally decided to give it a (blind) try, and the theme is a welcome addition to a balanced bidding card game.

Very strategic, despite initial superficial impressions - each time I play, I see how vital the key moves are, and combinations of abilities. Continuing to develop my opinion on this game.

Interesting game of bidding and bluffing and tactical card play.  There are some fun decisions to be made throughout the game.  I'd rate it higher, but the variable powers for each competitor make it a game that needs to be played several times to really shine, but the fantasy theme makes that difficult for me.  Family gaming can only withstand so many monsters and fairies.  Good game, I'll play it but not one I'm likely to want to own again.

This game has both interesting background story and the intriguing mechanic. You play a rich lord in Ancient Roman time and watch the fight of monsters in an arena colossal while making your bet and earning money from it. The sooner you make your bet, the more money you get, and of course, the more dangerous that animal is (because your fellow players see that and will do whatever they can to kill it). I think this game is somehow underrated.

This is a fun game - try to keep your gladiators alive while killing off your opponents.  Or team up with some of your opponents for an even better chance to keep your fighters fighting.  I have found it's best to bet early in the game for more points, even though the outcomes of your creatures are less certain at the beginning.  But that is how it is in real life - the biggest pay offs are given to those who take the biggest chances.  This game, with all its creatures and creature abilities, is a lot of fun.  I recommend it.

Awesome game. I usually win this one, but I also usually go last...which gives you a major one up on the other players. This is because when you go last, you can always make sure you creature survives. There are ways for others to get around it, but it is still helpful to go last. Our games dont usually make it to the 5th round due to lack of cards.

RATING: 7
Interesting game of betting and bluffing, but the American-style theme and cheap components don't sit well with typical Knizia minimalism. It's also a bit long for what should really be a filler.

Update: New FFG small box version has much better components.

This is a simple, light game of bidding and gladiatorial combat.  Each player is given a set of tokens to use for bidding and a handful of cards. 8 out of the 12 warriors are chosen at the start of the game, and players represent financial backers. Each turn the players may place their token on a warrior who is still fighting and does not yet have a token in that round. Then a player plays a card; the cards represent the warriors and have a number.  When all the active warriors have a card on the table the round ends and the warrior with the lowest number is eliminated, then a new round begins. At the end of 5 rounds the tokens of e remaining warriors are tallied, earlier tokens being worth more, and a winner is declared.

Interesting game.  I've played about 3 times so far, and while I enjoy the game, it seems a lot lighter than most of Knizia's others.

I think this one needs a few more plays for me to appreciate it's subtleties.

RATING: 6
Is the design subtle or War / trick-taking game in disguise, with some powers? Those are the extremes. Feels weird to just be playing cards for pure strength on them, tracking cards played is just annoying (will probably allow open info), and the game flow is a little weird (almost a do-whatever in the early-game, with later rounds being more interesting but shorter). But think there's potential here as a 3-player generalization of Schotten-Totten.

However, think it has a huge kingmaking problem at the end. Or maybe you rig it so there isn't a chance of the loser hurting you.

RATING: 7.5
A proper betting game. Or a shared incentives game? Either would work. So - there are some critters fighting and you want to bet on 3 out of 8 that will survive. The sooner you bet, the more points you get for a successful bet. So - there's shared incentives (like owning stock, really), there's bluffing (secret bet), and then there's special powers used occasionally to make things a bit more lively. Oh and some extra cards to mess people over. 

Neat. 

Problem: FFG art. Ugh. Should have been rethemed to something like pokemon (but actually nice looking). This needs some visual and/or thematic overhaul to make it more appealing. If you're fine with it, it works nicely though.

Card, Wagering. Fun card game in which players bet on different monsters in the arena, and then play cards on their behalf to see who advances each round. Most money at the end wins.

The special abilities of each monster add a lot to the game, as does the tension between betting more to get to use those abilities vs make that monster a big target for the other players to take out.

Update: I think I like Cheaty Mages better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Colossal Arena isn't a bad game, but it isn't much fun for me. Like some of Knizia's other games, this one manages to exude a dry-ish mechanical feel even though it's chalk full of monsters and mythological creatures. At it's heart, it's a numbers game where the cards provide for a limited ability to bend the rules in different ways. It's put together in a rather clever way, but neither I nor my pals had much fun with it. My wife describes CA thus, "It's lame." That pretty much kills it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A nice game, a lot of thought.  There is some luck of the draw with the cards, but a lot of decisions on which card to play when, where to put your bets without tipping your hand on your secret bet, etc.  It can sometimes cause a player to be out of the running (and thus competing to only affect other players), but it's still an interesting battle.

As usual Knizia really excells in the simple design extrapalated into complex gameplay.  This could be a dry numbers game, there is enough color in this from monster powers to referees to the spectator cards to make this a stand out.  It seems that there aren't enough cards to go around in a full compliment of players to last for the entire 5 rounds, so we just play out our hand with no draws.

I like the whole concept of placing your bets and then watching the monsters get eliminated one at a time.  Also fun to see watch your opponents reactions as this happens.  Your cards give you just enough influence to be dangerous, while at the same time not giving away your secret bet.  Clocks in at just the right amount of time for a game with this combination of strategy and luck.

RATING: 7
This is a reasonably simple betting game with somewhat strategic card play.  All the players are betting on who will win in an arena of mythical creatures by placing one of their betting chips in the column of the character they are betting on.  The earlier you bet the bigger your payout but the later you bet the more information you have (one creature is eliminated each round).

Players have a decent amount of control over who is eliminated though by playing cards on each of the characters.  When each character has a card and there is ONE lowest value that character is eliminated.  This continues for 5 rounds or until the cards run out.

The biggest boon for this for me besides the interesting theme is the special powers on each of the characters.  Whoever is the "backer" (has the highest value in bets on a character) uses the special ability of that character when playing a card on him.  This mixes the game up from more than just a bland card game.

While the game is somewhat simple with a good theme and decent fun factor and amount of strategy I think the biggest problem is it can take too long for what I expect a game of this size and weight to take.

You know it's bad statistics to ride a secret bet on the dragon!" Best return on $10 I ever spent, probably have played this a couple hundred times over the years.

My goodness is this a fun game. It takes about one game to figure out how aggressively to bet and play cards, but once you know what's going on, this game is INTENSE. Plays just as well with 3 as it does with 5, a rare thing. My only complaint is that decisions in the early rounds don't carry a ton of weight. That's alleviated by the grueling endgame decisions though.

[2 plays] Initial reaction rating.  I don't dislike this game.  I just find it after a couple tries to be an "average" game.  There it just ultimately too many things I feel I have no control over.  I place a bet based on very limited knowledge early in the game.  Ultimately I have no idea what cards I will have five rounds later, and even less idea what other people have or will do.  It feels like I am just randomly guessing.  In later rounds I can make a more informed guess but then the bet is worth a lot less.  Just feels the game sort of happens without a lot I can do to really effect the outcome.  On the other hand it plays fast, so I can tolerate the luck.  The theme of monsters battling it out and placing bets on the winner is pretty cool.  It is a game I likely won't suggest we play, but if others want to play it I wouldn't oppose it either.

[FFG 'Colossal Arena' 04 edition] {Fantasy; fighting; secret-goal, commodity speculation, utility cards; optimal 3-4p} Colossal Arena is a decent betting game. I usually like games with hidden objectives because it usually makes them more engaging and it allows bluffing and intrigues. Therefore, I bought CA for this mechanics and its many good reviews. It's highly tactical games with some strategies; luck isn't important. It has strong player interaction and it's confrontational. It's thematic, too. Players have many decisions to make each turn; therefore, it's sometimes agonizing and taxing and should be avoided for slow players. It's one of the very nicely designed tactical card games. Recommended. 

The cards are sturdy though the artwork is busy. The references cards are very handy. The box is too large for what it is.

Glad for the reprint, because this is a great Knizia game.  A little too much discarding at the end of the turn because 33% of the cards at the beginning of the game will not be used, but not that big a deal.  Artwork on Titan:  the Arena is much better, and for those with a choice, probably a better buy than the reprint.

Slick. Knizia built a really neat (and I think very thematic) game around such a simple concept. There's a lot of strategy here--not just in monster combat, but also in betting and bluffing. However, some turns at the beginning/middle of a round (especially the early rounds) can feel a little bit meaningless.

RATING: 6
tl;dr: too chaotic

This is a game in which you bet on what monsters will survive. You also influence what monster will survive and sometimes you get to use their special ability. Every round you get to a point where you know the round can end very soon. If you're the person doing so, you can probably end it to your benefit. If not, the other player will probably screw you. My issue is that in most cases you don't have control over who gets to end the round, the other players decide.
For me the amount of control was too low, and there can be huge swings in monster's powers. That annoyed me quite a bit.
I guess it's not a bad design if you like that kind of thing, but I don't care for it.

I understand that there may be more clever and interesting games around, but this one hits me just right.

Portable, simple to teach, variety of strategies, reasonable time length, scales well from 2-5, challenging and fun.

The fantasy theme may put some off (it kept me from playing for a while), but while it is well integrated into the gameplay it is not a fantasy game.

The fun for me is that one has to decide when they are satisfied with the current game state in a particular round and then work to end the round with game state intact. It is not dissimilar to Knizia's Taj Mahal. Both games have a poker element to them and I find it thoroughly entertaining.

Update:  Went from 10 to an 8.  This seems bad, but really I must have been in a great mood the day I rated it.  It is a great game and I still love to play.

Update:  Rating moves down to 7.5.  Still a very good game, but this does bring out AP in some and then the game becomes a bit tedious.  This is not exactly the game's fault and this is still one of my most played.  I can see this one possibly falling another half point but no further.  I do enjoy it immensely when played quickly.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 4
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 4
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 4
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 4


Overall - 4

When I first played this game, I would have given it at least a 9.  I absolutely loved both the feel and the mechanic.

One major flaw ruined this game for me however; it seems to be the epitome of a king-maker game.  The outcome of nearly every game is decided by a player who can no longer win, but who still has to play cards deciding which monster gets removed on the last round.  That this happens frequently enough to destroy a game I otherwise loved makes me very sad indeed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The bidding, card placement, and use of monster's powers allow many opportunities to screw your opponent over. I love games which are fairly indirect in the competition between players. Knowing which monsters to back at the start is quite arbitrary, but if you don't mind a bit of random play then this is a nice quick game to play with non gamers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
 Good fun once the players become familiar with the system, which is mostly the special powers.  Fun take that, with some gambling.  As long as players don't overthink this game(which has happened) its a quick fun filler.  Three has the most control.  Five is a tad more chaotic.   The addition of the extra monsters is a bit of a mistake, as cleanup/setup becomes too much for what the game offers.  The game is fun enough to warrant it, and the variability is fun.... but thats my major knock. 

In my head its essentially a decent 3 player game.  I think I would hide my box if 5 players were looking for a game of it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I do realy enjoy this game more than some other Knizia games like Kingdom's.  The key seems to be in scoring that hidden vote which takes some cunning game play and NOT just number counting...you have to throw other players off the scent of who you voted for! Enjoyable game that can create some great table talk and back stabbing alliances...which is always fun! >:)

Wow, just found out I'd always been playing it wrong, played the right way it's great now I know what the fuss was about! 

FYI - I used to play where each player would bet, then each play a card, then each draw up. What you should do is one player bet then play a card then draw up then the next player go. This is very poorly explained in the rules - in my defence!

Quite different for a RK game.  It's betting system is unique and although is a little luck heavy in the card draw, allows for a number of strategic decisions.

A nice game that non-gamers have warmed to whenever I have brought it out. Alright, that's only ever been twice but both times were complete successes.

I have played a couple plays under the belt now.  In my first two player game, I did not appreciate the value of being able to move a bidding chip, and Terri cremed me with it.  The next game was a little more balanced, and I did not feel personally responsible for dealing with every threat, and that was nice.  I do not feel like I have encountered the real meat of the game, but I do like the basics.

Unique, as far as the games I've played.  Unfortunately, unique doesn't translate to "good" in this case.  Short and unpredictable, in a really unsatisfying way.  Virtually unplayable with more than three players, as you can't exert enough control over the board.  Even with three, though, you often are forced to waste a turn while you wait for cards that are more useful to you.  Not particularly thrilling.  The good words that this one garners are a real puzzle to me, as I can't find anything redeeming about this.

There's a fun factor to it, but ultimately one is at the mercy of the cards and the game runs a bit long for what it offers. With three there was a bit more control than with four but there also seemed to be too many overlapping incentives, with some monsters getting all the bets and others none. Neither player count seems to get it quite right.

RATING: 7
Very solid auction game. I love the theme and it does a good job of making it feel like an arena battle for the most part. Variable powers keeps the game fresh. The art is very good and the components are good as well. This Knizia game seems to slip under the radar compared to his other gems but I really enjoy this one. Easy to learn and teach.

RATING: 5
It's a little difficult to grasp the first time around, but playing one round will make everything fall into place.  It's composed of an interesting betting mechanism that reminded me somewhat of Modern Art's payout system.  It's more reliant on the luck of the draw, but I like the way the game develops.

In Colossal Arena there is a group of eight creatures that are fighting. Each round, one of the creatures will die. To decide which unlucky soul will be the victim, players put numbered power cards in front of the creatures, with the lowest one going the way of the dodo. But what makes this game interesting at all is that players can make five bets throughout the game which will sometimes allow them to use a creature's special power and gives the game a method of scoring at the end.

Colossal Arena sports Knizia's typical design philosophy of simple mechanisms with complex interactions. This is a pretty straight forward betting game, where players wager on a creature or two and then try to keep it alive through five rounds of card play. The cards all sport very nice artwork, while the reminder text makes keeping track of everything a breeze. The wrinkles to card play provided by the creature powers give the game a measure of unpredictability and strategic depth. When Colossal Arena makes an appearance at our game table, we play the crap out of it and everyone has a great time. Colossal Arena is definitely a keeper.

BUT

As usual with Knizia, the theme is completely pasted on. It's got betting and gladiator elimination, which supports the arena theme. There are pictures of monsters to support the fantasy theme. And yet, it could have just as easily been themed around the stock market, real estate, politics, or growing Lima beans with little or no change to the mechanisms. Bleh. 

Stupid soulless Knizia games...{end rant}

There are a lot of fascinating things here. Glad to see it reprinted, esp. improved with new creatures for variety. The imbalanced creatures are a feature, and not a bug at all.

But...every time I've played it there's been an early "effective elimination" and thus a kingmaker.  Someone will get into an untenable position early, often through no real fault of their own.

Two players gives you a bit more room for strategy, but four constrains the bidding more and keeps more creatures relevant.  I enjoy both.  (Haven't played with three or five yet).

Update: Played with five. Bidding gets a bit too crowded, I think. Some of the powers become a lot less useful when nearly every spot is filled. Still a great game though.

Update: Played with three.  I think this might be the best number.  Bidding is nicely constrained, but you still feel like you have a lot of control over who gets eliminated, unlike with more players.

After one play,  and playing Lost Cities right after this made me realise that counting cards in this game is both very possible and very useful.  Setting up to be a monster's backer is a lot tougher than I thought,  but probably strategic bidding next time will help.   Card quality was pretty good in my opinion (but not as nice as linen-textured),  but a bit more differentiation between the Spectator cards and the regular monsters would have been nice,  although I don't think anyone actually ever made a mistake.

Rating is for Avalan Hill version. I hate hate HATE the FFG version. They took an incredible game and broke it with terrible graphic design (AH version it's MUCH easier to tell the cards apart at a glance) and abilities that have no place in the game. If you can change your bet or bet an earlier row later in the game, it completely neuters the strategic play of placing and then protecting early bids.

{ P - 3 [4] 5 6 }

Killer paradox in a neat little package: you can't win without betting on multiple monsters (more monsters than you can ever hope to control, to be specific) so you have to form alliances ... with your opponents. Which is tricky, to say the least, especially if you bet your way into a situation where the maximum score of one of the people you "ally" with exceeds you in every possible outcome. Massive downsides abound unfortunately, including shaft-the-loser as a bona fide mechanic (players in contention for the lead would prefer the demise of a fighter backed by the person in last than their own) and of course deck-drawing, situational lucksackery. (Better hope the guy after you doesn't draw hosers for your monsters.) Not the best game ever obviously but perhaps the most deserving of a good fix.

We haven't played this one yet. I hope it's better than Minotaur Lords (another Knizia) game that we bought at the same time.

RATING: 6
Decent Knizia game.  Played with characters not initially in the Titan: Arena version that seemed too powerful to some.  Feels like a lot of the game is out of your control.  Somewhat enjoyable, but I can think of a lot of games that have a similar feel and are much more fun.  Played again with only original characters and now some seem so weak that no one feels like bothering with the special ability.

Feels okay - is somewhat confrontational and the luck of the draw can influence the game rather much. We played a game where the magus didn't come out for a long time, and thus the game ended after few rounds.

5 after 1 play.

Last player in turn order has a huge advantage and the game resolves around trying to be in that position during the round which will end in elimination.

Clever, fun, light bidding game. Exception based quirks keep the gameplay fast, furious and constantly in flux. Not the most sterling RK entry, but an excellent 'tweener game to get the game night started.

The theme is predictably thin, but it's definitely a compelling game, and I do like the special powers of most of the creatures quite a bit.

RATING: 6
This game is fun, but the unbalanced special powers really detract from the play.  Further, the game play consists of destroying more than building, which detracts from its fun factor.

House variant:  The cost of using a special power increases through time as follows:

8 characters 0 gold
7 characters 1 gold
6 characters 1 gold
5 characters 2 gold
4 characters 2 gold

These are gold against the final winning conditions, to mitigate the usage of special powers.

A fun bluffing game, but the theme is very tacked on and bad luck or unpredictable opponents can have you out of the game pretty early. Still very fun in a traditional card game sort of way.

RATING: 6.5
In our 5-player game the session ended prematurely during the 4th round when the draw deck was exhausted, leaving 5 creatures still alive.  For something that was supposed to be depicting a battle for the survival of the fittest, it seemed awfully anticlimatic to have so many of them still left standing.

I enjoyed the betting mechanism, especially the inclusion of the secret bet; as well as the creature abilities.  While I do agree that some monster seem to have an advantage over others, but I believe that is mitigated by the fact that the backer may not always have the appropriate card to play in order to activate that particular power.

Update #1: 2nd play was of the older version of Titan Arena.  The game ending condition was far more preferable here.  Otherwise there were little differences between the two.

RATING: 2.5
I like the game, but something about it bothers me.  I can see (especially during the last rounds of the game) kingmaking going on...and you don't have a whole lot of control over what's going on.  It's fun, but we'll see if these negatives overshadow the fun factor it provides. Update: don't ever have a real desire to play again.  Lack of control is off-putting and annoying.

A fun game with a semi-pasted-on theme. Reiner Knizia pulls it off well enough, though. The gameplay is fairly strategic and the component quality is good.

I have Titan the Arena.

Fun, quick card and bidding game.  The secret bet makes the game.  After several plays, the game still remains fun to play and well worth picking up.  I would say, "Buy this game."

Read the rules today while at the DMV getting my Wisconsin license.  It was kind of hard to really comprehend without the game in front of me.  Played a game when we got home.  The wife pulled some slick moves and beat me 14-8.  I think it is a keeper.  I am curious how it plays with more people.

Second game:  11-8 I win.

Third game:  My wife pulled a slick move with the Unicorn's power to hose me in the end.

I don't like fantasy games. A fantasy game must have an appropriate environment.
Creatures screaming, people shouting, fighting sounds... This is a quite good simple mechanic which would work better in a more realistic theme. These "special powers" features just drags me out.

After 1 Play: If you're looking for a richly themed fantasy experience, look elsewhere.  This is basically a betting game, which is not one of my favorite genres.  With 5 players it was too chaotic.  I'm willing to give it another chance with fewer people.

Classic Knizia. A brilliantly simple bidding mechanism, and great card powers. A great duelling card game for two players. I'm guessing it would scale very well too.

Евробаталия монстров на арене. Делал книция, механика уникальная. Хорошая карточная необычная игра. Если нравятся карточные игры типа Цитаделей, Эволюции, Кондотьера и т.п., и не нравятся примитивные типа Wizard, Корова 006 и т.п. - можно смело брать, под коробкой нас ждёт приключение с отменным балансом.

Минусы - требует много места для карточной игры (столика LACK из икеи не хватит), есть некий хаос, возрастающий от числа игроков, т.е. идеальна на двоих. Своего хода можно просто не дождаться и продуть опекаемого монстра, и спланировать уже вчетвером такое сложно.

Cool artwork and creature powers but it's a little too hard to control the outcome of the battle, so early bets tends to be shots in the dark.

A nice, light, quick card game. Doesn't burn out your brain, but you do have some interesting decisions to make, and there's the fun mystery of who everyone's secret bet is on. Ranger never lives my ass, I'll *make* him live!

The new version (Colossal Arena, old one is Titan Arena) adds several new monsters, although you start with the same number. They add nice variety, and seem to be well thought out and not overpowered.

RATING: 7
1/1/12 -- Games of Colossal Arena tend to run hot or cold.  I think it's a pretty good game, but it doesn't scale well to 5 and it can be tough to noobz to grasp.  I'm dropping my rating from 8 to 7.

11/30/08 -- True to form, this R. Knizia classic did not immediately win me over.  After about the first 3 goes, however, it quickly shot up the awesome-o-meter.  I now regard it quite highly - right up there with brushing teeth and flushing toilets after use, etc.

I feel this game is very rough.
Because with smaller information in the start of the game you must do the most important decision in the game.  Later you will find more information, but it is too late for you to change your strategy. This is pretty often very frustrating.

8 criaturas (columnas) compiten en la arena y solo 3 sobrevivirán. Roba cartas, apuesta a un mountro, coloca cartas en una fila, verifica si una criatura es eliminada (la más débil cuando se compleyte una fila). Ganará el jugador que tenga más apuestas en las criaturas sobrevivientes.

RATING: 7
Easy to learn, but truly great.  The only thing I'm not enamoured with is that our games seem to end due to running out of cards rather than meeting their natural ending.  A shame - maybe they need some '11' combat cards  :)
Based on the FFG version.

Some characters can seem unbalanced compared to others.

Still loads of fun, as long as you're playing with at least 4 players (with just 2, it's very "meh", a 5 at best).

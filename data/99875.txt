You have to take this game for what it is. It's a speedy push your luck die roller with a wonderful theme. I really enjoy it. My wife and I can play one after cleaning off the dinner table. Rules are completely trvial, the decisions are minor, and it takes just a few minutes to finish. For all that, it's perfect.

RATING: 8
Great light family dice game. Very quick to teach and turns go by quickly. Lots of fun as players get just the right dice they need, or not as the case may be. But I'd avoid lots of players with this one or the downtime would possibly get a bit much. A players turn might take no more than a minute but an entire game lasts about 8-10 rounds in the games I've played. With three players that's about a 15-20 minute game but for each player you add you are adding 5 or more minutes to the game. I have yet to confirm this but I think 6 players would be about the most I could stand for a game like this.

Overall the game is better than Zombie/Cthulhu Dice or other similar light dice games I've played.

RATING: N/A
zombie dice came first, right? I actually enjoy this more than Zombie dice, because it actually has some decision making aside from just deciding when to stop. as such, the casual groups I normally play with don't like this as much. go figure. the theme is a more kid-friendly though.

Another filler that we have recently introduced to our group. When I first saw the rating, I was a little concerned that it will be too simple and might be placed aside after a few plays. To my surprise, the ladies especially love this game for its silly fun. Another good filler which is fun and easy to explain.

The only drawback would be the need to take down the scores while playing to see who hits 25 points first and thus starting the end game count down.

This game is great to take when waiting for another event to start.  I play it while waiting for a movie to start or while shopping with the family.  It is fun, quick, and affordable.  Of course the game is not deep, but when I am on the go and might have a few spare moments to chuck dice on a stable platform, this game can be very fun.  I hardily recomment it.

If you need a quick/filler dice game, this is the one to get versus contemporaries like Zombie Dice/Trophy Buck. There is more strategy here than simply roll X symbol before getting 3 of X symbol in press your luck style game play. Pick up a copy for $10 or under and keep it in your game bag.

Filler de dados, con una temática muy simpática. Los extraterrestres han venido a la tierra, y como no tienen muy claro quien domina, se llevan de todo: Pollos, vacas y humanos.

En los datos también hay platillos volantes y tanques. Los platillos hay que compensarlos con los tanques... y al margen de eso, hay que conseguir quedarse con el resto, si es en set, mejor, que tiene puntuación especial. 

Muy divertido. rapido de explicar y se puede jguar en cualquier lado.

This is the perfect bar game, which is the niche I see it filling in my collection. Which mostly just makes me feel better about owning it because I don't find it very exciting. Still, the rules explanation : fun ratio is solid.

Good push your luck game. The set bonus offers a positive incentive to keep pushing your luck and a way to catch up, the theme is well integrated, and the dice are nice.

Slightly more going on than Zombie Dice, but I'm not sure I like the flying saucer mechanic where it can feel like you just lose your whole turn sometimes.

I wouldn't mind playing this with 2 or 3 people, but any more than that and there's just too much downtime for not enough payoff.

RATING: 9
Fun game in the mold of Zombie Dice; fewer but more interesting decisions. You must juggle your desire for points against the tanks that have come to stop you. Each tank deprives you of two points and if you don't stop them all with a death ray for each, you won't score anything. Raucous fun in the style of Farkle.

RATING: 6
In order to keep the play time down to the 20-30 minutes that this game deserves, I would suggest lowering the win condition by player count, thus: 
VP = 25 - 5*(P - 2)

So 20 points for a three-player game, 15 for four, etc. By extension, the game is unsuitable (even with this modification) for any more than five players.

I love Zombie Dice, this is like ZD crossed with Heckmeck. And, while I can somehow pass ZD as a "Wizard apprentice tries out spells" theme with my daughter, MD is much more family friendly without losing the wacky appeal.
A hit with the whole family!

This isn't the sort of game I usually appreciate, but the one time I played it, I enjoyed it more than expected. Did I just have low expectations? Does it involve just enough more choice / thought than most push-your-luck dice games? Was I just that tired? I don't know.

RATING: 3
Components: Nice sized dice with clear iconography. Fun theme.

Experience: Senseless but mildly amusing. I wouldn't recommend this with more than two players, as adding more players doesn't add any enjoyment for the existing players, but does create more down time between turns. As Yahtzee-style games go, there are much better games out there.

Eagerness to Play Again: No Desire

On the back of the success of Zombie Dice came Martian Dice. A similar game, but different enough that you want to buy it also. Fun. Not as good as its predecessor, though. And, quite frankly, I think Batman Dice came along later and perfected the formula they were going for. So we have 3 similar dice games sitting side by side in similar cups on our game shelf, but when we go to pull one out, it's pretty much never this one.

Martian Dice is a very light push-your-luck dice game. It reminds me of Pickomino which, given the choice, I would prefer to play as it has a little more depth. If you have ten minutes to kill, Martian Dice is okay. But it isn't something I would buy.

I am not in the target audience for Martian Dice. In fact I doubt I would have ever played it if I had not received it as my door prize and had some time to kill with a friend while we were waiting for our plane after BGG.Con. 

It has the typical three rolls, keep a subset of dice and reroll the rest set-up that seems to be the standard for dice games, with the twist that you have to as many “death lasers” as your opponent’s “tanks” otherwise you do not score for the round. You get points for each human, chicken, or cow you kidnap with bonus points being awarded if you get a set. 

After the handful of plays we had at the airport I was done with it. The single item that separates it out from previous dice games was insufficient to make me want to play it again and if I ever had a desire to play this sort of simple dice game again I would just play Sushizock im Gockelwock.

Basically Zombie Dice with more decisions and a higher scoring threshold.  This is good and bad as it makes it more interesting (by a little) whilst also making it longer (by more).  All in all I slightly prefer it to Zombie Dice but am happy owning both.

A blatent rip-off of SJG's Zombie Dice packaging and concept, but the game itself is different. Like Zombie Dice, it's not bad, but not that great either. It plays quickly and is portable, which are points in it's favor.  The rules are humorous.

Maybe a hair better than Zombie Dice, more decisions but not much. It's still a random dice game. Glad I have both, but you don't need both in your collection. I say pick based on what theme you like better.

Oh, and unlike Zombie Dice, you don't have to constantly stick your hand in the can to draw more dice. Much less fiddly and makes for a slightly easier experience.

(As of [b]1[/b] play) A pretty standard push-your-luck dice game with a pasted-on alien theme. Slightly more interesting decisions than its sibling [GAMEID=62871], but not enough to keep me particularly interested.

RATING: 8
Wacky theme, easy-to-learn and fun press-your-luck dice rolling game.

Similar packaging & ideas to [gameid=62871].  Martian Dice makes big comebacks less likely (tanks can keep your score down), and thus there's less risk/reward than Farkle type games, but there are more decisions than Zombie Dice.

Suggested variant: Try implementing the "Last Licks" rule from Cosmic Wimpout.

With >4 players, reduce the score to win from 25 to 20.

Shameless dice fest. The dice hate me, but I love it anyway. Very similar to Martian Dice, but the two are different enough so that if you like one, the other's worth getting.

RATING: 3
John Weber roped me into trying this one. (I wanted to play 7 Wonders.) I do not like most dice games, and this proved to be no exception. Just a bunch of rolling dice and deciding on which ones to keep, hoping your virtuous Martian Green Death Rays outnumbered the Evil Red Human Tanks, and scoring one or two points in the bargain. I fared poorly in my game because the dice hated me (they often do). I didn't like them much either so I guess we're even. Takes too long for what it is, which is not much at all.

RATING: 7
A quick, fun little push your luck dice rolling game. The design is very reminiscent of Zombie Dice. I would say this one is more fun to play, but it is questionable if you should get this one if you already own the other (I answered that question with yes, both please). Martian dice requires me to roll all thirteen dice at once, which is far more viscerally pleasing to slam than all down and see what happens, than trying to jam my hamhands into the small canister to pull out three dice at a time.

Magnus has claimed dibs on the dice as he has lost a number of them.

Similar to Zombie dice but you can't press your luck so much as to win in one round! I like that you have to weigh in the risk and potentially keep more tanks and wind up scoring zero points but I also feel like you have a buffering period of collecting ways to prevent this. Something I didn't feel was strongly represented in Zombie Dice.
Your opinion of this game is REALLY dependent upon those you're playing with. It can be a blast with the right people...kids and adults.

The theme is great. There should be much more games about alien abduction! Unluckily, they forgot to put a game with legs into the box. It's fun for a few minutes to laugh about others misfortune or growl about your own one when the dice show up lots of human tanks again. But really, there's not much more than a simple decision how much risk you're willing to take, i.e. go for as much initial death rays as possible or for lots of abductees. Risk mostly doesn't pay out in the long term and the game can definitely long outlast its welcome when players risk too much.

A nice little filler, which involves almost no brain power. Usually turns out not to be a push your luck game (as I had expected because of it's (almost) twin brother - Zombie Dice), as more frequently you have to keep rolling to fight off the tanks. Although rules explanation creates some confused looks, after the first round everything is clear. End game condition (25 points) seemed too much for a 7 player game, but that is easily adjustable. Overall - a cute game with awsome dice (cows seem to be the favourite of many players).

RATING: 5
This game has a short attention span.  After playing one or two rounds the novelty wears off and the rest of the game is spent trying and hoping someone reaches the required 25 points to win.  The dice are cute and the theme is silly but it doesn't hold up for long.  This is a game that I'd probably only pull out if someone asked to play it; I imagine that would only be the case if they'd never played it before.  In fairness, this is probably due more to the nature of this sort of dice game rather than any flaw in this particular game.  If you're looking for a silly, simple dice filler then this one will do.

I confess: I didn't expect much out of this game when we sat down to play it.  It was one of those "okay, let's play it just so we can say we have" moments.  Who could have suspected that  [i]Martian Dice[/i] would be so much fun? The decisions were engaging, the play time was super-quick.  We were all constantly kibitzing about one another's options.

One small note--this game is subject to a run-away leader.  When I had 23 points to the second-place player's 11, I was pretty well unbeatable.

A game that should be very fun, but, due to some very glaring omissions in the base rules ... combined with a surprisingly tedious mechanic ... it is not.  I'd say the game is still ok for children, but compared to say Zombie Dice this game is really not that good. Skip this title ...

En 1938, Orson Welles narra radiofonicamente la invasión de la tierra por parte de OVNIs. ¿Por que ocurrió tal cosa? porque la Tierra decidió defenderse. ¿De quien? de nosotros. 

Un grupo de alienigenas hemos decidido investigar ese planeta azul que tanto mola. Para ello, al comprobar que existe en él diferentes formas de vida optamos por tomar unas muestras y abducir a los seres que parecen ser la raza dominante: Humanos, vacas y pollo. Pero... que es ese fuego? ¿por que  tanto dolor? Si la tierra te declara la guerra, debes jugar a guerra.

Juego rapido, de dados, en el que lanzar una vez más es la delgada linea roja entre un exito abrumador y una humillante derrota.

RATING: 5
Pretty fun dice game. Luck factor is somewhat mitigated by which species you choose to abduct, and you're incentivized to try for all three, so you might end up giving up a killer roll so you can win on variety instead of sheer numbers. Luck DOES become an increasing factor as you push it, which makes for a great feeling game. Not bad for solo, but best when watching old sci-fi films or when you just want a game with the ante-upping feel of gambling, but without any actual gambling in it.

I was expecting to like this more than Zombie Dice. I don't think that was the case, at least not after 2 plays. Don't get met wrong, it is a fun game, it's just more unique than I expected.

Even better than I could have thought. The game has just enough to keep you interested but is streamlined enought that it's accessible to just about everyone.  (We did play with a variant in which you can count bonus points for multiple sets which seems to add to the choices since it may be in someone's best interest to leave a big roll and try for a few sets.  I wouldn't play without it now that we've tried it.)

RATING: 7
There's some very minimal strategy here, but being a dice game it's pretty much just a quick little luck-fest.  However, it's certainly a fun one.  The design and theme are excellent and I've had a great time sitting around with 3-4 people playing through a few quick games.  In fact, I brought this out with a few friends and after several "okay, one more game" in a row, one of them went out and bought his own copy that week.  Too much pure luck to really get me excited, but certainly a nice filler and a good way to casually burn away 10-15 minutes between bigger games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Game in a Nutshell: Dice game of collecting (abducting) humans, chickens, and cows while fending off attacks by matching them with your death-rays.

Played as: 2 player

Pros: Lots of pretty, colorful dice. I find it heavily enjoyable to hear and feel the rattle of all those dice inside the "shaking tube". I like the fun theme and its sense of humor. Plays quick enough.

Cons: I really wish I was able to press my luck a bit more with this game. As it is, it takes a little while for the excitement of your turn to build. The first few rolls don't feel like they matter much, then you may have one roll that means something and its over... next players turn. I want to let it ride! It also makes it very tough to make up a defecate, such that it's possible to feel like you're out of contention after a couple times around the table.

Other: In a time when it seems there's another new themed mini dice-game coming out every week, this is the one that has the least enjoyable "game". It's like they took Zombie Dice, re-themed it, and stripped the excitement out of it. Bears is a better, albeit completely different, game too.

Best Use: Put it in the kid's game closet; they might be able to overlook the game's shortcomings.

I first got wind of this after playing zombie-dice, and noticed that this similar game had a little more depth than just "Do I roll again?"

Of the two, I like this one much better and so far my family is having a blast filling their time with this easy pick-up-and-play.

RATING: 5
[i]Martian Dice[/i] is a dice rolling, set collection game. Thirteen special dice are packaged in a cardboard tube, which serves as both container and as an extremely noisy dice cup. The dice are identical, with bright coloured cartoon pictures. One face of the die shows a Tank - these are bad, but you must keep them. Two faces show Flying Saucers - these offset Tanks: you need at least as many saucers as you have tanks in order to score. The other three faces show humans, chickens and cows - these are all worth points. Roll the dice: set aside any tanks; keep one category of the remaining dice; roll again, repeat. A player may not add to the scoring sets once they are collected - if you take some chickens, you do not get to add more after a subsequent roll. Score one point per die you collect, plus a bonus of three points if you get one of each.

Strategy? Hardly! There's a little fun in the push-your-luck aspect, and the dice are cool (I have a little dice collection). [i]Martian Dice[/i] is the sort of game kids can take to camp, or we break out while waiting for people at the pub.

Fun, simple game.  Not a whole lot of strategy (which is reasonable for a dice game), but it has an entertaining theme and is easy to learn and play.  However, because it is so simple the long-term re-playability is low compared to other easy to learn, quick to play games.

It's OK for what it is.  The all or nothing mechanic with the tanks is fairly punishing for a light little dice game.  My 9-yr-old was discouraged after multi-tank rolls to start her first few turns.  You are kind of forced to go for big turns or nothing.  It's not very fun to end your turn with two safe points.

Dice Like Crack !!  A Light Push-Your-Luck Dice Set Collection Game Better Than Yahtzee !! By Scott Almes and TMG !! 

This is a blast! It plays quick and is one of the easiest games to learn.

I was skeptical, but when I finally tried it, my wife and I couldn't stop playing it. I prefer this theme more than that of Zombie Dice. Martian Dice has a different set of decisions than the Steve Jackson dice games, and Martian Dice's dice are all the same, while the SJ games dice vary.

Cute funny artwork by Josh Cappel.

"Fun push-your-luck dice filler with some interesting decisions."

What I like:
- Simple but fun push-your-luck game
- More decisions than Zombie Dice
- Great theme; excellent components

What I don't like:
- Runs long with 4+ players
- Strong second-player advantage with 2p

I think the BGG-voted weight of 1.1 is maybe a bit low, so I'll say 1.3.

RATING: 6
This is the type of game that needs it's excitement from the press-your-luck - factor. But here that doens't really work. Imho you want that +3 bonus for the combo cow + chicken + scary face, but as you can only add them one at a time, you have to make at least 3 rolls and normally at least a 4th for the green stuff, which make you're sort off already rolled out and decisions have been made automatically for you. So for me a mediocre dice game, not worth owning as there are far more better out there.

Compared to Zombie Dice, the game play is more interesting, but the theme doesn't role play as well (which is half the fun). Also, a 25 point game seems a bit long, but perhaps it's needed for game balance.

* Never felt any tension.

Compared to "Can't Stop", "Skyline" and even "Square Shooters", this game is kind of dull. I'm reluctant to even call it much of a game. That said, we "played" it quite a bit and had some fun with it so game or not it's still somewhat entertaining. Starting with a 5.

Doesn't have the same high level push your luck factor as Zombie Dice, but takes significantly longer. You don't have that edgy "should I risk one more roll" that comes with great dice rollers - there's really little choice in what you do. Just don't roll tanks! 

Would balk at play with 5+ players again, fun enough with less.

The dice may be nice, but there is not really one meaningful decision in the whole game. Better dice rolling games like the similar (but quite more fun) Würfel-Bohnanza or the more involved King of Tokyo render this game completely obsolete.

RATING: 7.5
Decent 10 minute filler to pull out and have a few laughs between, before or after meatier games. You can basically play this game with anyone and any situation, which is a big plus. The game has some decision making going on but not too much that it would slow it down. Use a variant for multiple 2 VP set bonuses, makes the game more interesting and somewhat faster.

Edit: -> rating to 7.5. Only play when you are tired. Then it's a really funny game.

4.12.15 Thought it would play like zombie dice which we love. While zombie dice is all about pushing you luck by pulling dice, this one works in reverse. You start will all of your dice and whittle your way down.  It does not have the same effect as the dice determine your odds more than pushing your luck. Still some light fun to be had.

Mind bogglingly adequate!

I expected a painfully bad clone of Zombie Dice.  Because of my extremely low expectations, I was pleasantly surprised.  The game has a lot of luck but does present actual choices that do have an actual impact on your score.  I'd guess that luck and choice are 50-50, which is waaaaay better than I was expecting...and surprisingly adequate for a quick game with nice dice.

With more plays, the game has proven to be more emphatically adequate.  If you happen to not roll many tanks, then there are some tough choices.  Mostly, you roll dice quickly and get on to the next turn...and next game.

Very, VERY fun, easy, quick, addictive, and good dice game for all the family. We´ve had very good games with this little game. Quality of its dices are very high (I like them a lot!). You can play it with the AUTOMATIC-PILOT ON because it´s very simple, but extremely fun!! For me, this is THE BEST in its category.

Two Player Value = Poor. This is not due to the number of players. There just is not much of a game here.


Honestly this game does not change with the number of players. This is a very simply and straight forward multi-player push-your-luck dice game.

Roll. Push your luck. Roll more. Repeat. Score. Done.

The first player to 25 points is the winner.

There is some small change from other games like this though. The game play is handled with a huge pool of dice instead of only a couple of dice rolled repeatedly. This makes for interesting decisions as the player must set aside a small group of dice from that pool with each roll. Therefore, the pool of dice to roll gets smaller with each continual roll making the press-your-luck mechanic tighter.

What few components there are, are nice.

The theme fits nicely.

- Easy to teach and learn

In the past, I did not imagine this to be the kind of game that I was into. However, having played it over and over, I absolutely love it and just want to play it all the time.

This is a heavily luck-based experience and, while that might be frustrating in a long game, it makes for an unpredictable and pretty exciting filler-type game. Plus, the strategy probably plays a larger role than one imagines as I pretty much ALWAYS lose.

The theme is fun and the production quality of the dice is ace, but BGG ratings are supposed to be based on desire to play and I have never yet turned down an opportunity to play this game.

On sale, quick filler, doesn't have zombies in it, funny theme? Oh yes, what a perfect game to add at the beginning of game nights when waiting for people to show up. I thought it was just a re-themed Zombie Dice but this game actually has much more strategy/press your luck to it. Do you take the 3 points and call it a day or go for the set and end up rolling that stupid tank? We like this game as a fast filler.

A very fun push-your-luck game of dice rolling and set collecting.  Cool 'alien abduction' theme, simple-as rules, great colourful graphics on the dice, and difficult choices within such a basic game.  Good for kids, but adults will have a blast too.  The 25-points target might seem long, but it helps to even out the luck involved (between the players), and some games can go right down to the wire!  Awesome as a filler or a travel mini-game.

Seems to be difficult to score more than a few points each turn ... so the game goes on a bit too long. It's a fun theme, although you don't get to say "braaaaiiiiinnss!" like you do with Zombie Dice.

--- Summary ---
13 d6: tank x 2, human, chicken, cow, death ray. Rotate turns till someone gets 25+ points; finish round (even turns); most points wins! Turn:
1. Roll all (remaining) dice
2. Set aside all tanks
3. From remaining dice, set aside all of one type; may not set aside human/cow/chicken if have already set some aside. If you cannot, Score the set-aside dice.
4. Either Score, or go to 1.

Scoring: 
- score set aside dice only
- 1pt per human/cow/chicken
- +3 bonus if you set aside at least one each human/cow/chicken

tl;dr: doesn't evolve

I quite like light dice games as fillers. Rolling stuff and making the best of what you get is a challenge I enjoy.
This game has a certain push your luck factor. If you take certain risk, you might bust and not score anything. Also, if you cash too much of one thing, you might not score as much as when you score a bit of everything.
That's all good. What let me down in this game is that there is no evolution whatsoever. Every turn you take you take from scratch and nothing is retained except your score. Every turn has the exact same flow and choices. The game gets old very fast because of that.
If you make a dice game, please make sure not every turn is the same!

Dice rolling luckfest, not really any important decisions to be made, but can be entertaining if you're looking for something quick in the right atmosphere.

RATING: 6
Not as good as Zombie Dice, though initially it seems better. It has better graphics on the dice, and choosing "what to keep" and "when to stop", means it technically has more choices.

However, more often than not, after your first roll during a turn, the dice play themselves -- it's easy to know what to keep and you just keep rolling until every thing is locked in.

In other words, deciding "when to stop" rarely has any tension. Lastly, in Zombie Dice, one crazy turn can win the game. That isn't possible here.

All that said, I still like this game. It's a fun little filler and a good option to break out for non-gamers and kids.

I see this as a lesser version of Zombie Dice. I would much prefer to play Zombie Dice as it moves at a faster pace and is far less frustrating (rolling a ton of tanks out of the blue is just annoying - not fun - while rolling a bunch of shotgun blasts is awesome).

That said, this is a simple filler game that requires almost no setup or teardown time and is very easy/fast to teach. If you just want something different between bigger games, this is worth a go.

[thing=99875][/thing] is a dice game, slightly based on Zombie Dice - you roll dice, wanting to get points, while, at the same time, trying to avoid losing your turn (and all your points). However, in [thing=99875][/thing] the player rolls all the 13 dice at the start - not 3 at a time.

The dice have 5 different symbols: human, chicken, cow, tanks and death ray (x2). After the initial roll, all the tanks are set aside and can't be rolled again. Then the player must choose one type of other result to also set aside. Humans, chickens and cows, once set aside, can't be chosen again in later rolls. Death rays can always be chosen again. The turn of a player ends when she chooses or when she can't set more dices aside - due to the restriction of not repeating a type already chosen. Either way, if at the end of the turn, the player has equal or more death rays than tanks, she scores points equal to the number of humans, cows and/or chickens she set aside during the turn - and a 3 points bonus if she got all the three types. However, if the number of tanks is greater, than the player scores nothing. Play proceeds until a player reaches 25 or more points - the rounds then will continue until everyone has the same number of turns. The player with the most points will be the winner!

[thing=99875][/thing] is an improvement over Zombie Dice - players simply have more choices and options when playing, as there is little chance to have a turn ending in a couple of rolls - as there is a struggle of getting tanks, replaying with taking death rays, and having less opportunities to score, or take some early points (like setting aside 4 cows), but depending of the number of tanks rolled, you reduce the chances of fighting off the earthlings with death rays. Also, since all the dice are equal and you roll all of them, even luck is a little lower, as you won't have the person taking green and yellow dice (in Zombie Dice) and having an easier time getting brains. Still, luck is the main element here - and even sound and thoughtful decisions can crumble down and lead you nowhere, if the dice choose so. There is no way around this, however, often the choices will matter.

Overall, [thing=99875][/thing] entertains with its light and carefree nature - one simply can't take this game too serious. It can run for a little longer than it should, as is has little depth to keep itself interesting, if bad luck (and risky choices) is present, but usually will stay in around 20 minutes, or less. [thing=99875][/thing] is made to just be dice rolling fun, and even in this matter is surpasses Zombie Dice, as you start rolling 13 instead of keeping a limit of 3. It isn't a game made for thinking too much nor to strategize. I recommend [thing=99875][/thing] for what it is - for those wanting it to be more, stay away, you will be disappointed.

An amusing push your luck game that takes the concept of Zombie Dice and significantly improves upon it. A quick and enjoyable low-cost filler, this one is worth having in your collection. Also, it's very portable and can be played almost anywhere there's a flat surface. The only down side is that there's no way to keep score in the package - pencil and paper or some other recording method is required. Highly recommended as a filler game.

Tentative rating at 5.5 after 1 play.  First impressions:  beautiful dice, but feels too finicky.  Scoring seems odd, in particular:  5 humans are 5 points; 1 human is 1 point?  It somehow feels like 5-of-a-kind should be a bit more valuable...  The game just doesn't flow or feel organic.  Sorry, i know that is a bit of a vague response.  

I would far rather play Zombie Dice for some brainless (and extremely thematic) chucking.  Or Pickomino for a bit more depth.

The rating kind of reflects my desire to play pure dice games. If I want to play a simple push-your-luck game with a short playing time, I would much rather play Diamant (Incan Gold) or Vegas. The only advantage of Martian Dice I can think of, is that it is very portable. That being said, Martian Dice is an OK dice game with very nice dice and a cool theme. 25 points is quite a lot to aim for though, and the game may very well outlast its welcome before that.

25 points sometimes seem impossible. Fantastic dice and theme. I'd be interested in an expansion.

A simple little dice filler. Roll the dice, set aside tanks which attack you, then collect humans, cows, and chickens for points, if you have enough death rays to fight off the tanks. Not a huge amount of decision making, but sometimes you just want to roll some dice, and with 13 of them here, it's very satisfying.

Enjoy it for what it is.  A filler with cute unique dice.  I like that it lasts a little longer than Zombie Dice, but don't like the no points per round tendancy.

UPDATE: Too complex for a truly dumb game and too dumb for a decent game. *Left* at LoB.

Great fun for a silly filler with dice. Doesn't feel as tense as zombie dice, although it's more strategic.

Well, it's not perfect, and it seems to have a prevailing tactic to use each turn, and it "suffers" from the issue of one person being forces to press his luck farther than the odds necessitate in order to stay in the game, but that's sort of what all push-your-luck dice games "suffer" from.  It's cute and enjoyable (if a little long), though, and I always like custom dice.

Light dice filler. I made  a variant using a deck of self-made (Artscow) cards in addition to the official dice. This game is extremely boring.

I generally like dice games, but this one isn't really up to snuff.  Play Roll through the Ages or King of Tokyo.  This one doesn't really have any decision making or anything else of interest going on.

Alright, [-]I hate dice[/-] dice hate me, but I love this game. Don't expect anything heavy and don't expect a game that will stay in your collection and be passed down to your grandchildren because this ain't it. However, it's a fantastic filler and would probably be good with kids.

This is like a more complex version of zombie dice. It is a fun game but I do not thing I have ever won a game. I wish I could say it was my own fault for pushing my luck too far, but that would suggest I score points to risk in the first place. While there is more strategy to this there is also more luck involved, and for that reason I still like zombie dice more.

good game to show kids who have only played yahtzee or liar's dice. The building menace of the tanks is a new mechanic that must be managed alongside your abducted booty of humes, cattle and chickens. This is an interesting and compact mechanic.

Pretty sure I've played this more than just once. I like this one, though it feels tough to do well at it. Would choose this one for a slightly more complex Zombie Dice.

Since Martians are superior to zombies in every way (training, flexibility, etc.), it only makes sense that [i]Martian Dice[/i] is better than [i]Zombie Dice[/i].

I've played this game an absurd amount of times (27) for what it is. For a $5 clearance find, it has definitely been a surprise. It's an addictive filler, even if it's not necessarily a great game.

Upgraded my ranking to a 9.5 The game is very well done and with four players you really have a battle right down to the wire.  Nice job by the new Avalon Hill.  I replaced the cheap plastic chips with clay ones and now it's a super game.  Rules are clear and game play is quite simple.

Not really as much of a fan of this one as I'd like to be.  Seems like there is an imbalance in the values of the rooms (Fancy Lounge, I'm looking at you), and being in the wrong place in the bidding order can completely lock you out of scoring the big points.  Developing your income/population doesn't really seem all that valuable.

Really great little game - light, simple, but it also makes you think. A wonderful game to introduce new players to sandbox Euro games. Sure, the mechanics are ripped straight out of Amun-Re and Alhambra, and those paper mats are annoying, but a nice game which you can get really cheaply.

I like it. I really like it. Much to my surprise AH did this right. Interesting tactical decisions and opportunities to block your opponents or at least make them pay a little bit more for something. Nice play length for a 4 player game. Looks good though they could have included some zip bags for all the little pieces. Would love to play a 5 player game. But hey, where's the showgirls?!

This game is what Avalon Hill should be doing all the time!  A Euro game made in the American market.  A very well thought out game and you get to make some very big decisions.  People claim this is a rip-off of other games, but it isn't.  It may share some of the same influences, but good grief, it plays entirely different.  How many games have a scoring track?  Oh my gosh!  Monopoly uses a board, this must be a Monopoly rip-off!!!!  Um... no...  Great game, lots of fun, what more can you ask?

We loved this game. AH put together a very euro-non war game that was a lot of fun. Seems like no downtime. Everyone's getting income, bidding, and building. We replaced the plastic chip with our nice clay casino chips and play on the poker felt table. An 8 after three plays. This and Nexus Ops are a couple great games coming from AH. Kudos!

The theme doesn't really grab me, but the game mechanics are nice. It plays fairly fast. Plays best with 4 . With 3, the competition isn't what it needs to be. So I can take or leave this one. I keep it because gamer friends like it. But it might go on the trade pile. Sold it.

Nice theme and nice gameplay but suffers from crappy components.

Vegas Showdown scratches many itches. Competition over crucial tiles can become fierce, thus resulting in very interesting auction rounds. Your OCD is satisfied while designing the layout of the casino. You are also building an engine, which automatically introduces a dramatic arc to the game. The game definitely gives you a feeling of having accomplished something since you start with an empty sheet and by the end you have built yourself a casino. This last fact is something I like, because after a game you find yourself speculating whether you could have done better somewhere. 

The abundance of short term tactical decision and long term strategy is something you have to appreciate as well. You have to have a plan but you also got to be able to adapt according to the current situation. Every game is guaranteed to fold out different, which keeps the game fresh for quite a long time.

However, the components are really crappy, especially the thin player mats, game board and the flimsy money chips. This is really a shame since with better production values the game would actually physically last longer than your interest.

Feels a bit chaotic and too much driven by randomness. The bidding mechanism is quite odd, and hard to grasp what constitutes a good bid.
Nevertheless it is reatively quick, has enough going on in it for players who love economic driven games, that require you to balance your resources.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A nice length game that plays quickly. Quite strategic although some elements of luck with the cards. Only played with 3 and possibly better with 4/5 due to more competition for tiles and casions filling up less.

From the Reviews: This is an economic/puzzle type of game and there are 3 pages of reviews that are mostly very favorable. One negative review was hammered pretty badly, so it seems difficult to see if this guy had a real claim to playing the game. For me personally "Vegas" is something that I go an entire life without being associated with it. The theme is the main knockdown for me, but I would try it with my gaming friends

RATING: 7
Played this a couple of times, I have no idea on what makes a good strategy so worth a few more games to explore it.

Amazing with 4 players, can't see the facination with 5, all the cheap stuff goes quickly and then you just sit fighting over the expensive stuff. 4 player seems a lot more balanced as only one player can get slots each turn and the cheaper items last a bit longer so you don't run out well before the end.

I won't play with 5 again, would be interesting to try it 3 player, possibly too much stuff available and not enough competition for bidding.

The luck of the draw on events and order of tiles seems to outweigh a lot of the strategy and some games can run away from you; it won't be one I want to play often but every now and then it is a simple, quick and engaging game to play.

RATING: 10
A construction game with multiple paths to victory.  The prices of items is regulated by a combination of Vinci-type depreciation for unbought items, and an Amun-Re type auction system.  The result is a tight game of money management: you need to have enough money to capture the opportunities of getting tiles when they are at bargain prices, and to bid up your opponents to prevent them from getting tiles at crazy bargains.  A game with medium rules complexity, a but small dose of luck, and high strategy and replay value.  Rating raised to 10 after more plays.

Good auction game with plenty of things to think about when evaluating the hotel/casino rooms you are bidding on.  Using poker chips as game money is a good mechanic anyway, and here, it fits the theme!

RATING: 5
I like auctions and I like the tile placement aspect of this game. But it felt really bland. Several things let it down.

1. The auction's aren't tense - there are too many items up for auction that most of the time there is little or no competition.
2. The gains from the auctions are too small - you win a slots and it gives you one revenue only. Even at the end of the game the player with the highest income had only 15 (you start with 5).
3. The very flimsy paper mat. They are made of glossy paper, of similar weight to a magazine page.

RATING: 8
Pros
- Cool casino building theme
- Auction mechanic is simple and easy 
- Event cards spice things up 
- Puzzle aspect of placing tiles is fun
- Different ways to score Fame points by how you build your casino
- Player aids for what you can build and where
- Reorganizing is a nice option and allows flexibility
- Accessible for non-gamers and family members 

Cons
- Some turns you spend just getting one point so you can get money
- Player mats are just thicker cardstock. The game could have used an actual board for the players
- Taking off something, you have to adjust on your VP track which isn't usually a problem, but it's a bit fiddly

Good, and a bunch more going for it than I would have thought. The bidding system (similar to those in Amun Re and Homesteaders, etc.) really helps out the auction-timid, as pretty much everything has been in some form "pre-priced" and the bid amounts are in discrete amounts, so you can feel a bit more comfortable in your bid (though this doesn't quite kill the interest of the bidding).

It seems like, though, there were a bit many rounds in which very few people wanted anything or everything was in demand. Which I guess is good for game dynamics, but it may have worked better if the competition were smoothed out a bit. A good design of elements in that population is generally less useful (just game end scoring) but population features tend to occupy more space, and vice versa for revenue features.

I did enjoy my play, and would absolutely play again, but I think I like the implementation a bit better in other games.

Familiar mechanics are cleverly assembled to produce a well-integrated and smoothly flowing game.  The auctions in Vegas Showdown have a distinctive feel.  The turn-by-turn price reduction of unsold premier rooms combines with open money and holdings to turn many auctions into a calculation of how low a price can be allowed to drop before bidding.  There is relatively little of the force the other guy up bidding that is the meat and drink of other auction games because three items more than there are players are available to buy each turn. As with the poker played at casino tables, this is a game of money management.  Being caught a few dollars short at key points will lose you the game.  Multiple ways of scoring present some interesting strategic options.  My one gripe is that the event cards can decide a close game.  I suspect that Vegas Showdown is better with four or five than with three.

Underappreciated. It's sad that for a while, betrayal was commanding the kind of gold-mine prices it was on e-bay, and this game is still relatively cheap despite being in mostly the same circumstances.

A pleasant game wherein players build their casinos by bidding for casino additions (tiles) of various sizes and shapes (squares or rectangles) which are then selectively added to each player's casino mat such that certain placement and connection rules are followed.  Each tile can add to their levels of income, popularity with visitors, or victory points.  Event cards are drawn that change certain rules from round to round.  At the end of the game, each player's casino is judged such that victory points are awarded for certain attributes.

{4 plays, 3 and 4 player} Not bad.  I like the bidding, the placement planning, the "fancy" requirements... but game falls a bit flat for me at the end.  The scores are usually close, which means winning seems to boil down to who gets lucky on the last turn.  There are really good games with variable endings where who the leader is changes, and it's tense 'cause the game could end, but somehow this isn't one of them.  It just feels more random to me here - whether it's a great event card for one player, or, as I've seen more than once, just getting the Theater.  It all works, though, and I'll definitely play it again if others want to.

This was a lot of fun! The bidding / turn mechanic was well implemented. There's a fair bit of strategizing over how you can place the various rooms that you've bid on. It's a game that has a lot of well balanced interactions, e.g., you vs. your own personal casino board (why did I put the restaurant there???), you vs. all the other players (stop stealing my slots from me!), you vs. the central bidding board (everything is soo expensive). The turns are surprisingly quick, not much AP as I would have expected.

the game-to-simplicity ratio has to be respected here considering how many elements are in play.  no need to really refer back to the rulebook as well, which is nice.  bidding = amun-re, player mats and development = princes of florence, tile laying = alhambra, etc.  many similarities, but it's simple overall, and the event deck adds a splash of american design.  it doesn't have as much tension as i would like, and the theme isn't as ingrained as i had expected.  still a good game, and i could see being willing to replay it several sessions in a row moreso than its above-mentioned influences because of its comparative lightness.  the production sucks compared to what it could have been compared to, say, alea, and really seems to hold the game back in terms of repeat visits.

This is a surprisingly descent game and will likely surprise first time players.  Themed around building a casino, the game play is a bit of a tile-layout game and a bit of a majority influence game.  The bonus points for people and money are significant as are the points for a good casino layout.  Be aware that the bidding process can leave players a bit frustrated, especially if the game is played cut-throat.  [GTI: TGSL]

The one game that makes you feel like you're building a real casino, bartering for new extensions to the casino, and gambling on customers and attractions.

Gamers will most likely prefer playing Princes of Florence, but if you want to have a great time with non-gamers, this game offers more luck.  It also is more intuitive to play and easier to relate to than Princes of Florence.

RATING: 8
6/17/07 - This has hit the table a couple of times and I've enjoyed it each time.  A nice mix of mechanics including tile placement, auctions, and to a certain extent resource management when taking into account people and cash.   This reminds me of Alhambra, but plays differently due to everyone being involved in the auction at the start of the game.   Sometimes it is quite difficult to generate money making your decisions more difficult as the game proceeds.

RATING: 7
When I first heard about this game I had little interest, even though it was being lauded as a pretty good game.  I ran across it at a Toys R Us sale, and couldn't pass up the deal.  I finally played it and was suprised at what a nice little Ameritrash offering this was.  Gameplay is deceptively simple yet thought provoking (reminds me a bit of The Princes of Florence).  But what's up with the bits?  Could they have produced any cheesier or cheap pieces of garbage?  I mean, this is a game about Las Vegas!  Everything should be glitz and glam--everything over the top.  How disappointing.  I guess there's a reason for the name "Ameritrash."  [Sale $5.49]

Not a bad game. Basic, easy to lean fun. The playmats are flimsy, the pieces are basic. But you are working with a floor plan after all. Perhaps i wanted more. All ages.

I love Vegas, love the theme. What could be better than Sim Casino?..... Pretty much any other game with the same theme! Maybe tile laying games just aren't for me, but there were WAY too many times in the game when the "pass" for 1 VP was the best action to take. Components are crap, I can't say I would never play it again, but I own way too many games to keep the "meh" ones.

Bid for different rooms, then arrange them to make the most impressive casino.  I was really impressed with this one - it's simple, but there's a lot of different things to keep track of, a lot of different paths to victory.  Event cards are a little random, but they're necessary to keep the game from being too analytical.  Great fun!

This is a fun bidding game with inescapable similarities to Princes of Florence.  At this point I feel it is not as great a game as the venerable PoF but it is reasonably fun and has its own separate challenges.  With more plays the rating may change.

Update: played a couple more times now.  My rating stands as is.  This is a fun game.

Not too bad of a game. Managed to fill up the entire Hotel area on my map, but was thoroughly out classed by one player who kept stockpiling money until some high value sections came out. I would suggest that maybe more scoring emphasis be placed on the number of people in your casino. Just because you have several high value cards shouldn't mean that everyone else is too far behind. We all knew who would win after a certain point just based upon her accumulation of rare buildings.

Like the bidding and the fact that it is Vegas themed.  Recently played it and feel like it's just an average game.  I really dislike the fact that the player mats are just paper vs. cardboard or laminated paper.

This game never made it to the table so I traded it away.

My first and favorite bidding game. The components are lacking but the gameplay makes you forget about the paper boards and cheap poker chips. The chips were quickly upgraded and the boards are now laminated. All is right in the world. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One part bidding game, one part tile placement game. Everyone is trying to buy various types of rooms to put into their casino which will increase their stats. There's also a small tech-tree which mandates that certain rooms have to be in your casino in order to build other rooms. Overall, the game is light on rules but offers a good amount of tension in the bidding rounds. Usually when rooms come out initially they are too expensive to be worth bidding on but they will drop in price and suddenly everyone will want it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A lot of good things going on in this game. I like how the bidding works for the various rooms. I also like figuring how how to place the rooms. The cards add some randomness in a fun way. I would've rated this a little higher if the components were nicer. But we just switch out for regular poker chips (we'll have to figure out something for the mats at some point).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.15
Vegas Showdown is just flat out fun! I enjoy the auction mechanic (having to put your marker on another item if you get outbid, like Amun-Re), and the casino building is its own little minigame where you try to place your tiles as well as possible for maximum points. I never get tired of playing this. Good idea to laminate the player boards, btw. I think it has extended the life of my game.

Sold:  This has the problem of it weighing so heavily in favor of those who know the values of certain properties from the get-go.  So I hate introducing this to anyone because you basically have no chance of winning for your first two full games - unless everyone has never played it.

...and even then, making calls without knowing what the calls are.

Which is great if you're going to play this 10-15 times.  BUT, when you're just sitting down for "lets play a game" with friends...  this is a non-starter.

This has been and probably always will be one of my favorite strategy games.  The mechanisms are surprisingly simple to grasp, yet the game offers a number of paths to victory.  The auction is probably one of my favorite aspects.  The pre-established bidding amounts make it so you know just what you can pay, and I love auctions where everyone can get something.  Then they throw in this superb tile-placement mechanism that adds another twist to the game.

I think my favorite aspect of the game is that I have played more than 20 times and have never once done the same thing.  There are so many ways to play.  You can be aggressive and play to block opponents, you can focus on increasing your income and therefore your buying power, you can even put all your efforts into just racking up victory points.  No 2 games are alike and, even when you lose, you feel like you accomplished something.  If I was forced to complain about something it would simply be the paper player boards.  It would be nice if they were cardboard to make them safer.  But, otherwise, this is a nearly perfect game for me and my family.

Three plays (5-p, 3-p, 3-p).First play, I was "meh". Second play, same. Third play...hey - I think I like this! The first two plays suffered from not enough action on the auctions...most of the time, there were no challenges for rooms. Third play, there was some bumping going on, and a lot more defensive positioning. Much more enjoyable. Playing with nicer poker chips helped, too. (I feel so shallow.)

RATING: 8
Finally, a decent auction game with a cool theme.  And a tile-placing mechanic to boot.  I think that some of the endgame "awards" (e.g. getting fame for having the highest income, etc.) are a little too powerful in comparison to the fame from placing rooms.

A really fun auction, tile-laying game where you work to build the most successful casino hotel.  There are a few cheap aspects to the production, but overall I think it is good and, most importantly, the game is fun with multiple paths to victory.  The randomness of the event cards can shift the game more than I would prefer, but that does not ruin this game for me; instead, it adds some dynamics that make the game better.

3 player game. An above average game.  I enjoy the tile laying aspect.  The only complaint I have is that the bidding for tiles can get a little tiring and seems to be the only thing you do turn after turn.  I had considered buying but I think I will play a friends copy.

Play #2 - Played with 5 players.  I liked this much better than my first play with 3 players.  What seemed like endless bids was missing with 5 players.  Much tighter auctions for tiles.  I will bump up the rating.

RATING: 7
Luck-heavy, but enjoyable game that pulls a ton of mechanics together... you can think of it as a jelly belly recipe that includes Amun-Re style auctions, Queen's Necklace style price reductions (for auction start price), Princes of Florence style tile placement, Alhambra style tile connectivity (i.e. all tiles must be able to trace a path to the casino entrance), Industria style pre-requisites for building certain tiles, and I've probably forgotten something.  My prediction is that it would be good with casual & non-gamers.

This is a good, light game with a lot of strategy and some luck.  Plays pretty quickly so it makes a good filler game.  We normally play it at the end of the night after something more time consuming like Descent or World of Warcraft.

While I am not a fan of the bidding mechanic except for a few exceptions, it didn't detract from this game too much.  Unfortunately I can see a rich get richer issue but in our game it didn't seem to advantage him too much as he needed to have made a couple choices differently to have gotten the win (but he had a huge point jump when it came to leftover money).  However I am a big fan of the tile placement and property building, that part I love and so taken as a whole it's a decent game that I would play again.

Building your casino is a lot of fun and although it's obviously very abstracted, it feels thematic.  There's really only two things going on- the auctions and the placement of the rooms- so it feels very clean and is very easy to teach.  Great gateway game but it also has a lot of staying power.  I like the element of randomness from the event cards also- you can't completely plan your strategy.  The most similar game I think is Princes of Florence but this totally blows that away.  Unfortunately, the components are pretty bad by today's standards.

Very good bidding game.  Turns go quickly, and keep everyone involved.  Played with 4, including 2 non-gamers, and although I got a few initial complaints on "complexity" during the rules explanation, everyone was really into it by turn 2, and the game went very smoothly.  An excellent gateway game, with enough strategy for a gamer.
Update: 2nd play, also with 4, 2 newbies, went very well.  I consider this one of my top Gateway games.  The only problem is that I haven't even come close to winning yet - dead last both times.
Update 2: Third play was a win.  I'm finally seeing the deeper strategy, and liking it.  Very, very accessible - everyone I've introduced it to likes it.

Update: Enjoyable, but not going to break into my top 10 list.  It's fine, but there's nothing here that really grabs me.  I wonder if better graphic design would have helped.  A game about casinos shouldn't be so ... blaah.

This is a good game but I guess it's not what I expected. I thought there would be more strategy and challenge in placing the tiles, but that hasn't been my experience playing it.

Very impressed after one play.  The game is relatively simple to play, but offers a number of different strategic/tactical options throughout the game.  Love the auctions, especially the depreciating starting bids.  The spatial play with the tiles is easy to grasp yet works well within the game.

EDIT - Still enjoying immensely after a few more plays.  I find the theme is very approachable for non/casual gamers.

Not too bad actually. Sure, it's got nothing on a Knizia auction game, or eurogames in general, and it's awfully derivative; but it's not aimed at the euro crowd. As a "board game for people who play RPGs and don't know much about boardgames", i.e., many of WotC's customers, it's pretty good.

Not much for anyone who's played a Knizia auction game, though. I mean honestly, if you're going to do an auction game, and you're a big-name, big-budget game company, and you're trying to establish your brand with a big-box game (the AH brand, while ancient by gaming standards, is still in limbo under Hasbro), why would you *not* go to Knizia? He's designed a huge variety of games, and he's the only one who has truly mastered this genre. As auction games go, Vegas Showdown is a second-rate effort. Good enough to definitely not suck, but for the discriminating gamer it mainly just highlights how much better Knizia is at this class of games than anyone else.

Princes of Florence lite.  Not as many decisions to make as in Princes and there is a slight element of chance to it.  The components, as has been endlessly repeated, suck.  But it's a game most people can grasp and get into easily.

Not bad, but not great either.  Yet another auction game.  The fun in this one comes from the event cards that mix things up a little bit.  Otherwise, it's a pretty typical auction game.

Played for the first time after owning this game for 3 and a half years. It was a fast and great play.  The biding is interesting and how the different rooms interact with each other is interesting. I rated it a 7.5 with thoughts that it will go up to an 8.5 once I see more strategy in the game.  (6/18/11)

Yep.  VS is a combination of other games.  What a entertainging combo.  The theme, I think, is gonna sucker in a lot of non gamers and many gamers alike.  I would have liked actual boards rather than the mats provided.  I got this game for cheap so it's a small small thing.  Doesn't give me the thrill or excitement that some of the other bidding games do.  Would rather play several other bidding games with player that are capable.

RATING: 9
The theme makes it a very accessible auction and tile laying game.  There is enough competition to make it interesting but, not enough that new players feel that they cannot participate.  The two-player variant included in the box is long and tedious but, the two-player variant in the Variant threads is excellent and makes this scale very well from 2-5 players.

Bland auction game with really no interesting mechanics.  If you are allowed to bid over somebody who just bid over you, why not make it an open auction?  Or maybe a Princes of Florence type structure where someone picks an item, and the last person to grab something gets it for the lowest price possible?  And there is way too much luck in what is available.  If you are playing a certain strategy and counting on a building, better hope it comes up, or you will probably lose.  Also, there is not much range in terms of plans of action.  You can't concentrate on slots to get early money, while ignoring populus and points, and get any advantage for that.  You get one extra dollar before the next auction round.  Big freaking deal...so what you are saying is what I take is not nearly as important as how I take it?  How bout I just don't play!  Put that in your AH pipe and smoke it.

Finally, a good theme in a designer game! I wish the game were a little better, but one step at a time. The auctions are a little tricky, and timing and planning ahead is very important. That's the good part. The completely arbitrary nature of the cards and how powerful and game changing they can be is a major problem. That's not the good part. Absolutely needs 5 to work. Much too loose otherwise.

RATING: 5
I was a bit disappointed after I tried this. We were 4 people playing, and I think Vegas Showdown needs 5 players to be truly enjoyable as it at its core is an auction game. The auction just wasn’t particularly fun or tense as there were too many things you could bid on, so even though we did overbid each other a lot, you could always just take something else which was almost as good. 

Now, the reason I bought Vegas Showdown in the first place was because of the spatial element which seemed very fun. And it definitely was the highlight of the game! I had a good time trying to bid on the right tiles and trying to fit them onto my board while trying to aim for maximum end game points! Those different end game points are what make the game enjoyable as you need to take into account various criteria when placing your tiles (filling up your yellow and blue areas, connect the two areas, forming diamond shapes etc). Oh, and I really liked the fact that there is only a single room tile of certain rooms! It makes the race for getting the requirements and the actual room more competitive. The progress of the game is clever as you start by drawing the crappy rooms from the A-stack and then draw the better rooms from the B-stack afterwards which mitigates the luck of the draw.

I also liked how your income was the lowest of the number of money and workers which made your decisions about what to bid a little trickier; you want to grow your economy, but you might also want to add a certain tile to your player board and those two things aren’t always the same. The end game is quite clever as you don’t know when the game will end, but it can also screw you over! Also, we didn’t know about the effects of the cards, and if we had we might have played a little differently. 
Vegas Showdown is not a particularly good or interesting auction game, but it’s a pretty cool spatial element game in which you manage your own little Casino while still keeping an eye out for the other players to see what they want. Ultimately, though, I think Vegas Showdown takes too long for the gaming experience it offers and therefore I think I would only play it again once with 5 players just to see the difference.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Okay. Nothing ground-breaking as there are elements from several other games all mixed together. I like the tetris part but the creation of diamond shapes seems very contrived. The auctions don't have much tension and the paper 'boards' are cheap and nasty.

RATING: 9.5
Another one of my favorites. I love planning out where to build things and constructing my little casino/hotel. It's always such a thrill when that upgrade you've known you've needed since turn 3 comes up later in the game and the thrill of outbidding others is such a rush. I HIGHLY recommend upgrading the money components to poker chips. Pour some drinks, get out your chips, name your casino, light a cigar, put on a character. This game guarantees fun.

Bidding is a good bit like Amun-Re, placing pieces in the palazzo area is sort of like Princes of Florence but not really, dont' see the St. Petes reference.  Biggest decisions in the game are if you should bid this turn or wait till next.  Enjoy the many aspects of the game but something feels a little dry about it.
--Update: After you get past 'samey' feel, this one is actually a lot of fun to play.  Bumped up.

Not a bad game, but it didn't have nearly as much opportunity to interact with other players as I'd like, except in the bidding.    Still, probably not good enough to be worthy of GAMES Magazine's 2007 Game of the Year award.

RATING: 6
Initial rating a 7. I'm surprised how much I enjoyed this one. It's got a number of things going for it. It's an auction game (one of my favorite categories), but it's simple enough to be a potential gateway. It's got a great theme. And, there's enough going on to keep gamers satisfied. Between the Amun-Re type bidding, the placement of tiles, and managing money, there's a surprising amount of game here... but there's very little fluff beyond the core game.

One critique... the components are average at best, and the paper mats are cheapo. Well, not every game can have top-notch production quality I suppose.

Update: Well, I finally traded this away for Glory to Rome. It's not a bad game. In fact, it's a good game. I'll happily play it with others. But, it's not a great game, and something kept me from suggesting it when I had more intriguing titles sitting on my shelf. I've got auctions covered a'plenty in my collection, so I found it a home instead of watching it collect dust.

RATING: 7
It feels really nice and relaxing to play. I think this comes from the looseness of the design. This does leads to problems as players don't really compete as much as you'd think they should in the auctions. The wealthiest players can often afford to win the best premium rooms available. These are much better than the standard rooms and will give a player more income in the next turns. Our three player game played suriprisingly fast and ended unexpectedly after just one hour. I would like to try it again and with more players. It was a solid auction game but didn't seem to have the depth of decision making that would bring me back again and again in the long run. However, I may just be saying that because I lost. :P The winner had a very wise strategy of taking the fame points and not wasting money on rooms that wouldn't bring him points. The rating may go up after a few more plays.

RATING: 6
Very good auction game thrown out of whack by very unlikeable random event cards. Nice short turns!

I really like how long it takes to recoup your investment on any of the income-raising tiles. In general, when anything comes on the board, the price seems unreasonable. As soon the price gets reasonable and somebody bids on it, everyone wants to bid him up. This makes for an interesting game of chicken. Players don't need to have their calculators at the ready but should be prepared to do a fair amount of math. Expected value of each tile to each player isn't that hard to calculate, and the game will likely be won by the player best able to make those calculations...or the one who happens to have a lot of restaurants when the right card comes out giving him tons of free points.

RATING: 3
This is a fairly light bidding game. I liked how the different tiles that came out were random but the cards that determine which new tiles come out had extra random events that I felt were unnecessary (such as "no new bidding on slot machines this round"). I believe the game would be better off without that extra randomness. 

The bidding mechanic in this game (which also happens to be the same style of bidding mechanic in Amun Re) is a mechanic that is just not interesting to me. The ability to go seperate ways sucks all of the tension out of the auction for me and makes the choice of which item to bid on much less interesting.

OK, I'm calling this one out- there isn't a single original idea in this completely derivative, near-plagaristic game.  There's nothing wrong with borrowing ideas and mechanics from other games, but when these games are all less than five years old and weren't terribly original to begin with, it's a problem.  I can practically tell you which games the designer has been playing recently, because he didn't obscure his influences very well- Alhambra, Princes of Florence, St. Petersburg, and Amun Re.  If you've played those games, you've essentially played Vegas Showdown and you'll more than likely be able to figure out what parts came from which games.  Mechanically, this is a functional game that suffers from some odd bottlenecking in the decision tree but is otherwise sound- chiefly because the elements it "borrows" from other games worked in the first place.  There is a negligable theme (more so than most Euros) and I'd rather play it over St. Pete, but at the end of the day this is a wasted opportunity to combine Euro mechanics with a solid, American theme.  Don't expect any "showdown" or "high stakes bidding", it's all just another boring and dull auction/optimization exercise with the only real innovation being a tech tree that could very well have been inspired by Industria.  The components are best described as chintzy (paper mats? come on!) and that great board game bogeyman of poor graphic design and typesetting pops up again in a game that could have looked really dynamite if nothing else.  It's a shame to see talent and the Avalon Hill name wasted on derivative, regressive piffle.

Our group played two games of this. Both were enjoyable. The game involves some decent strategy, but nothing too deep. I had heard the game is repetitive but none of us found it that way. This game is good but not stellar. The bidding and building of the casino give the game enough diversity and some room for repeat playings. The randomness of which and when the buildings come out, along with the bonus cards keep the game from having set plays. However you can still try for some overarching stategies.

Vegas Showdown kicks butt in part because it combines elements from a variety of games. While building the biggest, baddest, most famous casino, you will see the economic strategy of Acquire, the "pay yourself at the end of each turn" mechanism of Power Grid, the tile layout concept of Settlers of Catan, and so forth.

And everyone likes building their own thing. Price reduction makes things interesting. It's largely about getting as many good deals as possible, but also knowing when to pay a premium for tiles you really need. Most fun when people willing to hose each other by bidding up tiles other players need.

Feels similar to Princes of Florence, and I find that I like this better.

I like the theme, so that helps. But what i don't love about it is that there really isnt all that much tension, or fighting for resources as similiar games have. You either can/can't afford something or you wait a round to save some money. 

Either way, it's a decent game, especially for $20....

Components: Great detail on the tiles. The paper mats are a bit annoying to lay flat, but otherwise good components.

Experience: Not a lot of out-bidding with four players; more of a tight money management game. Having to constantly take a publicity action is a bit annoying. Fun to build my casino. Easy to screw up and have to wait a few turns recovering from buying something out of order.

Good auction game. The theme is nice, but does't really add anything to it; you're mainly just buying fame, money and people. It's a nice balancing act, though.

An auction game that uses the bidding technique of Amun-Re, to buy features of your own hotel-casino complex (slot machines, lounges, restaurants, etc.), which you then have to fit into your building in what I'm told is a manner similar to Princes of Florence (which I haven't played).  A very solid and approachable game.

Extremely unoriginal, but manages to steal good ideas and put them together in an inoffensive way. Like all of Hasbro's Avalon Hill games, this one could do much better if the company would give it a nice production. The game seems to cry out for a nice edition.

Showdown is a bit of a misnomer.  A Vegas Showdown would have something to do with playing cards, or a roulette wheel, or at least a Carol Channing-Phyllis Diller center-stage cage match.  But this is about interior designers fitting out casinos.  It's got an OK auction mechanic saddled onto a space management superstructure.

Let's first adress the elephant in the room. This game is ugly. Ugly, ugly, UGLY. The component quality is abyssmal, the artwork is non existent, but the actual gameplay compansates for that. The auctions are quick and clean and the options are so many you can try a different strategy every time you play.

RATING: 8
Much nicer than I expected.  Played twice now and still enjoy it.  It's not really brain-burning by any means and has some luck elements in terms of which cards and tiles come up when but this adds to the replayability I think.  There are still tactical decisions to make based on these.

American version of classical german auction game (!)Too random to be interesting. Available choices are pretty obvious. It pales when compared to Knizia's classics (Ra, Modern Art, Medici, Traumfabrik). Materials could be improved.

RATING: 9
Pro:
- requires different skills for playing - planning ahead, logistics, money management;
- good economics behind the game, I especially like the mechnism of money earning, where the minimum of two values is valid and you have to develop in both direction.


Cons:
- The gameplay process sometimes is too repetetive, you do the same actions every time round and round.

Result:
Very good game worth a try.

Doesn't feel like your building a casino at all. It just feels like a generic auction game. Didn't really like it after my first play, but have played it a few times since and it is starting to grow on me. (rating has gone from 4 to 7)

RATING: 7
Pleasant innocuous euro. Didn't really grab me as having anything new or exciting. Bid for tiles, build cash earning capacity, then maximise your VPs.
I'm not sure why they bothered with the tile-laying part since its straight forward and it would be a rare player that wouldn't fill & connect as required. Its not like the tiles have tricky shapes or anything.
Throw in some random event cards and you have everything you would expect in a mid-weight euro.
Meh.

My first game with a bidding mechanic.  
First play thoughts - overall, I am very impressed with this game.  Lots of options, and many different paths to victory.  It's hard to know who will win, even up to the very end.    The box says 75 minute playtime.  However, get a couple experienced gamers, add familiarity with the rules, and you could shave 15 or more minutes off that time.  The components are heavy cardboard stock, and attractively printed, but the game boards are just paper.  A very solid game, and worth obtaining.  

This is just another game that went away because it never got played, mostly because it wasn't 2-player.

This is a very enjoyable game.  My only complaint is that there is a lot of accounting which takes away from the fun part of making decisions.  As a computer game, my opinion of this game would go up (since the computer could take care of all the accounting).

---Edit---
My rating keeps going up over time.  This little game packs a great punch.  Unfortunately, all of the accounting really does get in the way for me.  If you don't mind the fiddly, do yourself a favor and play this game.  It's a very impressive accomplishment.

Tentative rating after one play. A mix between Factory Fun (without the stress) and the bidding system from Amun-Re? I liked it, but still not something I'd ask for a lot. Too many games similar in feel out there. The bid system could have been more exciting. Why the fixed steps for example?

The strong theme takes this from a 6 to a 7.  Like PoF, the lives of each player are a little too distant from each other, but VS has even less interaction (if possible).  Fun and satisfying to make your little casino.

RATING: 8
This game has a lot going for it. It borrows from Amun-Re, Allhambra, and ExtraBlatt.  It is, by far, superior to Allhambra and ExtraBlatt.  There's plenty of strategy here and the auctions are fun.  Then you have the mechanics of building your casino/restaurant with the tiles.  So much better than Allhambra.  There's more control in this game.  It really does a good job with the theme too.  I think I'd like to see the money kept secret though to speed up play a bit.  I'd suggest this one anytime.

Interesting "auction" game. Was enjoyable enough to play, and I would definitely play it again. We only play three-player, but I admit I am curious as to how tight it would end up being with more. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Players bit on casino tiles and rooms, in a effort to attract the people and pull in the dollars.  During a turn players collect income, then enter an Amun-Re round of bidding to claim casino tiles.  These tiles are slotted onto player mats, in Princes of Florence style.  Victory points are awarded for all sorts of things at the end of the game.  A Frankenstein's monster of a game, built up from around a dozen other Euros, however it all bolts together very nicely, and is a very good game.  The flimsy player mats are a bit of a letdown.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Surprisingly elegant design from Avalon Hill.  A somewhat lighter (and shorter) game in the auction/planning/economic genre of Princes of Florence and Amun-Re, with interesting tile placement elements akin to Alhambra.  I worry a little about long-term replayability, but right now I'm happy to keep playing it whenever I get a chance.  I'd like to see an expansion, though, maybe some sort of hidden goals a la prestige cards from Princes?

A game that was derided upon its release for being too derivative of other games, and yet that describes 90% of Eurogames being released in 2012.

Have owned this for almost a decade before finally getting it to the table with my wife and two kids. I liked it more than I thought I would. Surprisingly cutthroat bidding for specific tiles. Tough decisions to make. Biggest downside would probably be the highly repetitive nature of the turns - you do the same six actions every turn of every game until it's over. Could probably get boring after many plays.

RATING: 7.5
I've had this game for quite a while and it's difficult to get to the table, not on its merits, but because the theme doesn't really call out to people.  I theorize that the exact same game, re-themed to INSERT-EUROPEAN-CITY-NAME-HERE would make it a lot easier to get people to agree to play.

At any rate, the theme belies this game's depth - while the main mechanic of the game is the bidding on tiles and managing your revenue, players are also going to have a blast laying out their hotel/casino.  If I can compare it to anything, it's like re-arranging your inventory case in Resident Evil 4 in order to maximize your score.  There is always the beckoning of new tiles to pick up (which can be held instead of placed, by the way, and this is a key part of managing your board), but sometimes it's better to renovate and rearrange your hotel/casino not just to maximize your score, but also to allow for those special premier tiles to be placed down in optimal position.

Due to the event deck, there is an element of randomness in that the events can limit or benefit players, but more importantly, they also determine which tiles come out next.  My first thought was, "Oh, man, why do we need friggin event cards for a game like this?"  However, it turns out that they add just the perfect amount of spice to the game and keep it interesting; the cards won't ever swing the game towards a single player, but they will keep you on your toes from time to time.

This is an excellent game and I'm glad that I didn't let my prejudices get the better of me.  The most difficult thing about this game is getting other people to sit down and play it with you.

Avalon Hill's newest game.

Vegas Showdown is quite simple and is enjoyable to play. It was a pleasent surprise when I first played it, though personally, the theme of Vegas Showdown doesn't do wonders for me, reason why the rating is only a 6. Mechanics is nice, games seems to be tight till the end. Random, luck with a tad of chaos.

If the theme would be different, than perhaps the rating could of been better.

Another game might change the game's rating. Recently got it in a game trade, so hopefully I will get it played a few times and see.

RATING: 8
I'm going with an "8" on this one. The main reason is that it's simple, fast and a lot of fun. Yes, there are borrowed mechanics, but so what? The games that Vegas Showdown borrows from have borrowed mechanics of their own. 

It's all about pulling the concept off in a fun and playable fashion. Avalon Hill did that. One other terrific aspect of this game is that there is virtually no downtime. It always feels like you're doing something because... well, you are!

This one stays in my collection

Remarkably good, considering the publisher's usual fare these days. It's not my favorite auction game, but I do enjoy it. I like the way the randomness in the tiles is dealt with, starting the price high for some tiles but starting it low for others.

RATING: 6
Good.  For having a high-roller theme, the gameplay itself is pretty bog-standard.  It's well-designed but a little lackluster.  That being said, it lightly scratches a few disparate itches (bidding, currency conversion analysis, puzzle-like tile placement).  The Crazy Analogy Dept. says: It's like having a light full-body massage instead of the deep and thorough head massage of a more focused game.  Sometimes you want one, sometimes the other.

Princes of Florence on the strip. I like this one a lot as a lighter, (slightly) more luck-driven version of PoF.

This got shelved for a while with our gaming group, because the "lounge" strategy seemed unstoppable.

Good ruleset, simple mechanics. THEME! THEME! THEME! Good time to play. Looking forward to playing this with more people. Can't decide if I like the luck that the event cards offered.  The luck of the cards seems to make this game a lot more forgiving than other auction games. Looking back on my plays, I feel like I would have won because of the choices I made, but got owned by the luck of the draw. Such is life. 

I had to pull down from 8.5 to 8. The luck is just too inconsistent for me at times, and that will never allow it to go any higher, but an 8 is still pretty good now, right? 

I've made some peace with the luck after an earned win. I guess the huge luck factor is what brings me back to this game. I really regret not getting another copy of this when they were so cheap.

I've played the game once and watched a close game; it just doesn't captivate me.  There is no way to really tear down the leader, but there isn't really the possibility of a runaway leader either.  The mechanics work well, it's just not something I plan on purchasing, and I will probably pass on future playing opportunities.  There are better games out there.

It has a great theme of high-stakes gambling but it is completely wasted on the fact that the person with the most money does not win. You could have the most pathetic casino in Vegas and still win, because you have two night clubs and a theatre!

[3 plays] At first I scorned this as a feebler, modernized take on Princes of Florence, but the more I've played it the more I enjoy it.  I like the structured auctions--something like Amun-Re--and though the theme had little immediate appeal, I've come to enjoy building my casinos.

Rating based on 1 3-player game.  Combines unique bidding mechanics with tile laying to get the most victory points.  Fairly balanced without much luck involved. Decent art/design.

RATING: 6
Had a lot of fun with this one early on in the hobby, and played a lot of games online while traveling. A reasonable, medium weight auction game that should appeal to lighter gamers. Everything is solid here; I don't find any major strengths or weaknesses. As to the latter, after a few plays you find the event deck anticipatable and not a game-breaker. 

It's a step-auction where you push each other around trying not to be the last one out and have to miss a turn from buying anything. There's moderate room for strategic paths in how you buy pre-reqs for the advanced rooms. Perhaps the best feature is the way your income is the lower of your revenue and population such that you are forced to balance things; be too easy to ignore one over the other otherwise (not to mention, unthematic). This forces certain tiles to be fought over during the game.

After a 15 or so plays, I can't say I'm very interested in revisiting this title, but I enjoyed all of those plays. I recently tried its cousin, Amun Re, for the first time and find the decisions there a layer deeper than what VS offers. So perhaps VS is a good introduction into the step-auction/booby prize type of game whereas Amun Re is the advanced course.

Well, I like many things with this game, but it drags out too much. You want the game to end many rounds before it actually does. That's a bad sign. Thus, a little outdated. I think the tile placement could have been more interesting, too.

Not bad. It seems like much of the game play comes down to buying something now to build yourself up a little or to sit and accumulate money for a big buy. Then it becomes a matter of figuring who your competition is for the bigger items and/or if you should bother (sometimes it seems like the winner of an auction for a big item is already decided before you try). Add in some arbitrary scoring bonuses at the end and you've got yourself a fairly mixed bag.  Still, not a bad attempt and I could see putting this on the table as a gateway game for casual friends.  Some have called it Amun-Re light and I would choose that game over this.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I don't think this game is given the credit it deserves. I has just enough predictable elements to give the euro gamer their kicks and just enough luck and theme to keep everyone else interested. It is very much a gamer's game (See: end of the game scoring) but is so simple and enjoyable it can really be played by anyone. 

Four players is probably best.

Played this as a 3player and want to play it again as a 4 or 5 player game. The components seem a little cheap, but since the price has gone down, that's okay. We tied for first place, but I won because I had more cash left over. The auction mechanism and being able to count up everyone's money, and the rising revenue and people markers all work very well. The turn order is good, the Chance deck is okay, it does add a little edge to the game. The basic choices are very good, and I especially liked the falling minimum bid price on the special tiles. The way the casino-hotel builds up looks very good. The only thing missing is a more detailed turn order aide. I could see this game being developed or tweaked and really hitting the spot. Good game, good family fun. *** Played again as a 4player game, less impressed ( I came dead last). I failed to get my income going, and so couldn't progress to the better stuff as the game progressed. My early lead faded, and the game reduced to obvious choices. I'm marking this down from 7.5 to 6.5 out of miffedness.

A neat mix of other popular games we know.  Princes of Florence (building on placemat), Amun Re (bidding style), and Pirate's Cove (cannons   crew) are present here.  It's a "Euro" game with an "American" theme.  One caveat: it appears the luck from the event cards is too overpowering on the winning outcome.  Otherwise, this would be a superior game.  Grade: B-

Nothing wrong in particular, just average if one considers the other games in the genre.  Ok experience but rather flimsy components.  Nothing new and unique, this is another auction game repackaged.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Towards the end of the game, when all the basic tiles are gone and only 1 new premier tile comes up, it really comes down to whether the first player is just going to max out the bidding track and grab the tile for 52 or not, with everyone else doing Publicity.  I would rate higher if that was not the case.

The end game is a little lacking, but everything up until then is good.

A little bit like Alhambra with the auction and tile placement rules.  I like Vegas Showdown more than Alhambra.

It's really not a bad game. Kind of wish I loved it more. I can't really find anything to dislike about it, but it strangely didn't do much for me at all, even though it seems like a game that is tailored to my preferences: it has bidding, some economy, building, planning... 

Like Princes of Florence in that you bid for stuff to put in your space, but using the Amun-Re bidding system. And it's lighter, of course. 

Still, even playing it before PoF, which is my current favorite, I didn't fall in love with it. Strange. 

Could be that the theme was lost on me? Need to try again to see if opinion will change.

Finally got to play it, and it kept feeling like we were missing something.  Now that we've gone through it once, maybe it'll be better, but at the end of each turn we'd place our rooms, and stare at each other going "OK, what now??  Oh, I guess we go on to the next turn."  It had a weird vibe somehow.  Must play it again, maybe with more people (we did it with 3).

A lot of people complain about the bits -- except for the individual play mats, the bits are EXCEPTIONAL, I think.  Casino chips for income, wooden parts for scoring, THICK cardboard tiles.  The bits got this game from a 6 to a 7.  You need a semi-good-sized table, by the way...

Very thematic game where players bid for available components of a casino and then place them on their own casino floor plan. Once placed whatever bonus available from that component (from slots to resturants, lounges (the basic 'always available' units) to the premier components such as fancy slots, fancy resturants, theaters, high roller rooms etc.) may be used to push up your money (turn income) marker, people marker (you can't collect more money than the number of people in your casino) or fame - the most fame wins the game.

Bidding starts at a minimum price and must go up in the increments marked on each track 'customized' for each component. For premier components, the minimum price in noted on each component and is indicated by a transparent red plastic chip. At the beginning of each turn (except for the first turn) the red chip is moved downward by one increment for each premium component. If you are outbid you get your bid marker back to bid again (on any available component).

When a premier component is purchased (three sized, small, med and large) a card is turned over to determine what size component is placed in the vacent place and the instructions on the cards must be followed, e.g. no one may bid on slots or fancy slots the upcoming turn, or players with lounges or fancy lounges get 3 fame for each one placed on their mats. The standard components are simply replaced until all of them are purchased.

Instead of bidding one may opt for "Publicity" (no limit as to the number of players that may choose this option in the same turn) for 1 fame and the option to bring one previously purchased component but not placed (maybe you didn't have the prerequisite, eg for fancy slots you must first have placed a slots) onto your mat. The other option is to "Renovate" where you get no fame but may remove 0, 1 or 2 components off your mat and then place 0, 1 or 2 previously purchased components onto your mat.

(3 games): It has a comparable auction mechanic as Amun Re as you buy different parts of your casino. Its more direct than Amun Re and easy to figure out. As you buy one area (ie. Slots, Restaurant, Lounge) you can then follow up the technology tree to a better area (ie. Dragon Room Slots, Fancy resaurant, Fancy lounge) These better areas make you more victory points. You also make bonus victory points if you had at the end of the game the highest amount of income, or people attracted to your casino, or if you fill up area on your map board, or if you connect your resaurant sections with you casion sections on you own map board. However no player interaction other than auction. Its a fun game overall and deeper than initally believed. Works well with non-gamer guys too. I just wish there was some actual gambling going on within the game. So dont buy this if you like casino style games because you will not find any here. Vegas is just the theme. 

The art is kinda cheap and ugly (like Vegas!) but great bits. One of the best parts is that there is strategy you develop through the game as you buy certain buildings and follow the different tech trees. However there are only 3 tech trees and so the game is not too involved. Its kinda solitare feeling like Princes of Florence. Plays in a little over 1 hour which in great!

Vegas Showdown is a patchwork game. It cobbles together elements of earlier games (the auction from Knizia's Amun-Re is the most obvious although it has been made much less tight in the process). The resulting game is not particularly original, or even thematic (certainly no more so than the aforementioned designer's games typically are) but it does have a fairly low level of entry while still providing some interesting decisions. I believe this is mostly an effect of the reduced impact of the auction and its replacement by the solitaire tile puzzle of constructing your own casino.

PRO - Good with 5 players; auctions are actually contested. Different scoring mechanisms give players flexibility.

There are even auction mechanics that give the feel of the Casino game tables.  Really nice.

Wir bauen uns ein Spielcasino. Dafür werden auf einem Spielbrett in der Anmutung eines Roulette-Tisch Tiles in verschiedenen Grössen ausgelegt, die Bestandteile eines Casinos verkörpern - vom einarmigen Banditen bis zum Hotelrestaurant. Diese werden nun in guter Knizia-Tradition ersteigert und anschliessend flächendeckend in der eigenen Auslage nach einfachen Bauregeln angelegt. Der Ausbau bringt Revenue und Publikum in Form von Geld als Chips oder Siegpunkte. VS ist wunderbare, handfeste, alte Biet-School mit einem hochamerikanischen Thema und dem zurückhaltenden Charme eines Croupiers, der von Ocean 100 träumt. Love it! Faites votre jeu!

This game is a lot of fun.  Great auction and tile placement game.  Those two mechanics make this comparable to Princes of Florence (and the scoring track measures fame, similar to PoF's prestige).  One major difference is the event cards, which add a little bit of chaos (in a good way, I think).  I prefer the gameplay of Vegas Showdown.  

There is a 2-player variant that plays quite well: each player builds two casinos and the player's score is the lesser of their two casinos.

Its an ok game.  I would play if asked, but its not a keeper.  I like the bidding mechanism, but the cards are too random and result in big game swings.  But I can see why the game needs this prompt, otherwise it would be just the same game from start to end.  Money is key in the game, so you do need a nice premium money card at the beginning.  The other major issue is components; yes the game is cheap, but the components (especially the player boards) are not sufficient for 2015.  You might put up with poor components if the game was brilliant, but it is not, so they just confirm why it will not hit the table again (Rating, 5.671, Aug 2015).

I know the first couple of times I played Vegas Showdown that I enjoyed. I'm generally giving passes to auction games as I love the genre. At this point, however, I've played sooo many great auction games and at the end of the day there just isn't anything special about Vegas Showdown. I can't think of one thing it doesn't differently or more interestingly than any other game of its type. Honestly, if I'm going to play a game like this, why wouldn't I play Princes of Florence?! It hits some of the same beats (and clearly VS was inspired by it) but its so much of a smarter, more innovative, more crafted game of this. I think Hasbro tried to make this one too accessible (or they published it because it had a chance with a wider crowd). I wouldn't say this is a bad game - it all works and there are enjoyable moments. But there are also enough turns where there is no competition in bids, and those feel like really boring turns. So overall, it was good for a couple of spins but it's not a game I feel like I need to revisit again.

Received in Glebers maths trade 22 Sep 2007. Interesting game; pays to know the event card deck.

RATING: 7
A great themed game with a nicely meshed set of mechanisms.   Bidding from "Amun-Re" and devaluation from "Queen's Necklace".  The event cards add a big mix of randomness.  The components are the only "Duhs" in the game.  The player's mats are thin paper and the two double-sided player aid's with the same info on both sides!?


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Interesting game, a bit of a mixture of mechanisms (Amun-Re anyone) but plays pretty well.  I was completely put off by the theme, but playing another's copy, plus the sale prices convinced.  With all the other components, why only paper for the player mats?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A great bidding game that is easy to teach and a lot of fun to play.  The indirect conflict makes it a fine choice for newer gamers.  Even when I lose -- which  seems to be often with this one -- I have a great time building my hotel.

Vegas Showdown is another game that got me into board gaming; and showed me that board games could be so much more than moving pieces around a board and rolling dice. Gameplay is fairly straightforward: players compete with each other in auctions to purchase tiles that they use to build their hotel. Different tiles provide different benefits with multiple paths to victory. The game is simple enough to learn that even my parents like to play, but beyond the surface their is enough strategy to keep a gamer coming back for me. My only complaint is that the component quality of the player boards is very low, but as of yet they have not been damaged.

Despite winning 'Game of the Year' from Games magazine, this game can be had for cheap along with other Hasbro/AH titles.  The components are cheap but perfectly functional, as is the look of the game.  Everyone has this game for trade these days, especially with Tanga helping to blow them out.  Hopefully people will open the shrinkwrap, look past the cheapish bits and play the game.  Take a dab of Princes of Florence and Alhambra, along with the auction mechanic from Evo, and you've got yourself a fine combo of a game.  We really enjoyed this one.

Surprisingly not horrible.  But the auctions have practically no tension, even with five players.  So what fun is an auction game with no tension?

RATING: 4
I think this would be better with more players to make the auctions more interesting. Same system that was employed in Cyclades. Overall the game is not particularly interesting. As with all euro/engine type games focus on income early, an slowly transition to earning VP. Not much strategy involved and no real difficult decisions or much room for elegant play. Bland.

A combination of Princes of Florence, Alhambra and Amun-Re :) Strikes a fair balance between the luck of the event cards and the cold dry skill of calculating best prices to purchase things and best places to place the rooms purchased.  The  components are of reasonable quality and is themed well enough to make you feel somewhat like a casino operator.

This has become one of my favorites.  It's very accessible to casual gamers, but there are real decisions to be made.  Yes, there is a serious luck element with the cards that can ruin your otherwise perfect planning, but it isn't overpowering.  This game is quite simply really fun to play. 

Update 12/11 - While not in the regular rotation at the moment, this one still gets pulled off the shelf and enjoyed a few times every year.

RATING: 3
 It is a rip off of [i]Princes of Florence[/i] with a touch of [i]St. Petersburg[/i]. The components are nothing special which is usually a strong point from Avalon Hill/Hasbro. Mostly the game lacks the little things, like the fact that bidding is less fierce than in Princes of Florence.

On another note I like building a plaza devoted to art or beautifying a city more than being the top purveyor of gambling and liquor. A 1970s version with a mafia element and leisure suits would be cool though.

RATING: 3
I guess Avalon Hill is trying to start making Euro-style games, but it's clear they don't know how to do it yet.  Vegas Showdown "functions," but that's about all I can say in its favor after one play.  I like the architectural restrictions and goals that the game presents, but the bidding system does not provide interesting dilemmas for the players.  You buy something at a good price, and then hope it works out for you.  You publicize now and then to save cash for the juicy tiles and for certain event cards.  The elephant in the room is the event card deck, which awards arbitrary bonuses and penalties to certain players with no warning.  Building blue tiles might be especially profitable or it might be a losing strategy.  You have no way of knowing, since you don't know which events you'll see.  And the dominance of the random events pretty much kills the game.  But there was little there in life, so there's little to mourn in death.  I might give Vegas Showdown one more chance, but I was thoroughly bored by it the first time through.  I suspect that people are giving this one the benefit of the doubt because it's Avalon Hill.  If this had been published by Kosmos or Hans im Glück, would anyone take notice?  No, because those publishers would have rejected this design.

This is a fun auction bidding game set in a Vegas casino.

RATING: 7.25
A little too complicated/a few too many elements to qualify as a "gateway" game, and a little too simple to satisfy an itch for a heavier game. Also has no 2 good player option (although the double casino variant sort of works) so we don't play this too often.  I like the game, though.

I enjoyed this game. It offers an interesting combination of Alhambra and Princes of Florence. Some of the components are a little flimsy, and some of the rewards seem unbalanced, but overall I think it is a good game. Not great, but good. UPDATE - After a few more plays, this game has gone up in my opinion. A pretty solid game with a lot of options for building your casino and making points. The random effects of cards can have a huge impact, but that isn't always a negative.

Described to me as, "This looks like an auction game. This sounds like an auction game. This is NOT an auction game."

RATING: 7.5
One of the best releases from the "new" Avalon Hill.  Vegas Showdown has little startlingly new.  Rather, it combines familiar mechanisms into a fun, easy-to-learn, yet challenging game.  After numerous plays, I have not discovered a sure-fire path to victory.  There seems to be numerous strategic options, and a fairly wide berth in terms of choices.  This is a game that is easy enough to not deter casual gamers or family members, but deep enough to hold the interest of gamers.  Hasbro has had some success of late marketing some games in the Avalon Hill line in mainstream game and toy stores.  Let’s hope that they include Vegas Showdown in this marketing push, as it could easily be a breakthrough and crossover game.

Solid auction game, light and moves fast. It would get better rating if the puzzling aspect was bit more interesting. I feel that the puzzling(=building casino) is bit too free and easy, and lacks urgency, strategy and emergence that would increase this games replayability.

RATING: 9
A most enjoyable experience. It is very much a Eurogame, but it has that special little New Avalon Hill twist. Just enough randomness to keep things interesting. Probably my favorite auction game that I own. Think Princes of Florence lite. Good amount of strategy, yet multiple strategies can work very well. I tend to gather expensive cards that grant a lot of fame by saving money and not bidding on many tiles. My wife buys tons of little stuff to boost her cash and nearly always fills both sides and connects them which is another great way of getting fame. 
UPDATE: Raised rating again. Every play just seems to bring out more possibilities to win. Mechanically, it seems like multiplayer solitaire, but this couldn't be further from the truth. There are so many paths to victory and the best one is always "what no one else is doing". Adaptation is key. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Enjoyed it from the first play, but need to remember all the special event cards and play with the strategy of trying to get those bonuses (e.g. points or money for slots, lounges, etc.).  

Here are some rules that are easy to miss:

- Flip the new premier tile *after* fulfilling the action on the event card.  That means that events that adjust the starting bids don't affect the tile that was drawn as a result of this card.

- Filled Casino Section: You score 5 Fame if the
yellow shaded section on your hotel-casino sheet is
completely filled in with ONLY YELLOW and/or GREEN tiles.
- Filled Hotel Section: You score 5 Fame if the
blue shaded section on your hotel-casino sheet is
completely filled in with ONLY BLUE and/or GREEN tiles.

- When you publicize, you immediately gain 1 Fame, plus you may put 1 tile you own that’s off your hotel-casino sheet onto your sheet.

- If you purchase a tile but don’t place it (because you choose not to or you don’t meet the prerequisites for it), you may instead place a tile onto your sheet that you had earlier put off to the side.

Great game!  Hits the same sweet spot as Catan for me without the die rolls; simple enough learning curve, enough branches and strategies to keep it interesting, enough randomness for variety.

This game cribs from many designer games and for the most part succeeds for me. It has an auction system reminiscent of Amun-Re and tile placement kind of similar to Alhambra, but in some ways beats that game for me since placement isn't as powerful or as critical as it can be in Alhambra. It's only problem for me is in it's production values. For the most part the game is fine, but the player mats are a plasticy-paper and they refuse to lie flat until some tiles are on it. Plus the building pre-requisites card is printed on both sides, but only includes 2 cards. That is unfortunate. But these things don't really hurt the game.

After playing this game a few times with a new group, I feel like I'm seeing both some good sides and bad sides to it from how I previously felt.  Before, I felt the game was a bit dull as we had already seen every building and card in the game and you can pretty easily add up who has how much money and what buildings they'll be looking for.  There just weren't enough decisions to be made other than the obvious ones in front of you.

With a different group that plays a little harder though, I can see the tightness of cash and importance of auctions and turn order giving it a lot more depth than I previously saw.  We also learned that playing without the card effects is a dry experience.  However, I now see too that you can plan your casino in advance, saving cash up to get only the rooms you absolutely need to fill it.  Unless you spot it at the beginning and are ready to actively combat that strategy, it will likely win every time.

Regardless, I feel like I've finally found this game after months of thinking it to be a bit of a disappointment for what I was expecting.

Keyflower "light" to me. 

One thing I like about this game, is that unlike in Keyflower, it is much more simple to weigh the possibilities of your opponents' strategies without weighing the game down with crazy AP.

I think it would be cool if the game had a fourth color building with a small grid to simulate the vertical component of the casino. In that area, you could build hotel rooms or suites.

I love games where you get to build stuff, and Vegas Showdown is a fun way to pretend to build a casino. I like the dynamics of bidding, even though I am not a big auction game fan. I like that you need to carefully plan to win, but a little randomness thrown in with the events makes it more fun.

(08/15/2008) Interesting "build up your casino/hotel" race game. Simple and quick to play, but with a good chunk of strategy, money management, and auctioning. Seems prone to stereotyped openings, however, with emphasis on slot machines in order to increase income first.

Update (05/09/2009) 5 plays: the standard opening of going after slots (and increasing income) does not necessarily win the game. One also cannot ignore lounges (to get stars) or other premium rooms (to get more stars). This is a solid game, and I'm bumping it up to a "9", since it combines simple mechanics, smooth and quick play, a good mix of tactical and strategic choices, and its wonderful accessibility. It works for newbies, non-gamers and non-wargamers as an excellent gateway game, and it works well as a family-game for young and old alike. It truly shines with five, but works well with four as well.

Update (01/15/2014) 14 plays: Finally, brought this to the table after not playing it for nearly two years. Still has staying power as an excellent auction game/VP race. Also, still an excellent gateway game. I believe it is finally settling to a solid "8", as I don't have the enthusiasm for it, as I once had. Nevertheless, this should be in every gamer's collection.

Update (07/05/2014) 15 plays: Getting a lot of lounges/fancy lounges, as well as getting a night club, and the only theatre is huge for getting lots of fame to win the game. The early emphasis on getting slots will get you income and money, but you cannot buy fame fast enough. You need some slots and at least one restaurant. Everything else can be lounges or the larger rooms. This seems to be the winning strategy, as I have seen one other game win with lounges. Is this it? I hope not. There seems to be many paths to victory, but I cannot help be think green rooms are it. Of course, I used to think slots was it, too. Still an "8".

Being from Las Vegas, the theme resonates with me, and I always love a good sim-builder. 

This game is all bids and building and each are fantastic. The auction mechanic is not only simple but it rids of unnecessarily long negotiation that usually comes about with open bidding. I was suprised how the management of points/money/persons is so easy to understand without cutting out the "meaty, thinky" bits with its purchasing options. It's like this game took the point acquisition mechanics of Suburbia and Castles of Mad King Ludwig (before they were actually published) and simplified it into an elegant and neat package...well, less emphasis on 'neat.' Yes, the game looks bad and the paper mats are unforgivable but I will take substance over style any day of the week, and I can look past this. I love this game!

Been curious about this one for a while. Got to play it at CoG and enjoyed it. I was confused about the auctioning since I thought it was like Amun-Re, but it wasn't. Nevertheless, the auctioning was as tense as it should have been and the area control was fun to do. Overall, it's a good game that I would play again.

RATING: 6.5
Okay,there is probably nothing wrong with this game and I will play it. Sometimes I actually even enjoy it. But it is not my favorite. I am a gambler, so perhaps my main qualm with this game is the components. Paper casino mats with cheap plastic cheaps....Boo Avalon Hill again (Hasbro's fault really). Cheaply built games are less appealing. I did pick this up for about $15 on Tanga (includes shipping), so I am not complaining much.

Super duper fun.  Fantastic auction game when you want something meatier than Ra or Dream Factory.  There is also a tile laying element.  The theme also works very well.  It is samey after many plays so don't over do it or you'll burn out on it.  Use your own poker chips to pimp this one out.

Played only once - lots of player interaction, a refreshing theme and an innovative bidding mechanic.  One of our players "hates" bidding games but loves this, I think because you're not always forced into tense bidding wars.  Besides, there is much else to do - after all, you are building a casino so you have to consider how you will lay out the rooms and which types of gambling you will specialise in!

It's taken me a lot of plays to really appreciate this game, but the more I play it, the better it gets.  It's not precisely an economic game; it's about money management and... saving, actually.  There's some planning in the game, but the unpredictability keeps it feeling light and.. gambly.  I like the events, I like the way the auction works, and probably most of all, I like the arc of the game--though definitely a euro, this one does have a strong narrative or at least groan-inspiring moments.

This game, next to the Roborally reprint, is probably the best thing to come out of the new Avalon Hill.  It reminds me of Princes of Florence without the soul-crushing punishment of perfect calculation coupled with the auction style of Amun-Re, but not as dry.  In short, it is a pick up and run friendly auction/building game done just to my tastes.  If I ever pick this up though, I'll just have to replace those god-awful player mats which come off shockingly cheap for such an otherwise beautifully produced game.

Ideal Players: 3-5

Description: Build your casino and attract customers in this Vegas auction game.

Pro: Interesting spatial element building paths through your casino and filling up space. Auctions tend towards fair market prices, but only being able to bid on one can let players get away with bargain buys. Enough complexity to be interesting without being a brain-burner. Beautiful components.

Con: Might be better with a different theme. Event cards could be significantly more interesting.

I love me some Vegas. I played this one once when it first came out and was very disappointed by it. Years later, reading all the praise for it on BGG, I decided that my initial impression must have been colored by my unrealistic high hopes, so I sought it out and gave it another go. Nope, still disappointed. The game's not awful or anything, it just feels too much like you're doing the same thing every turn, and the only interesting decision is whether to bid for the most expensive thing now or save for another turn; I did not find the spatial puzzle aspect interesting. Thank goodness Lords of Vegas came along!

Not an innovative game (but then again, how many games truly are) but a fun one to play.  This is a light auction/resource management game that adds a little more complexity then either alone.  Too bad Hasbro decided to kill this one after it won game of the year.

I would have preferred a different name for the game as the name implies that there should be a lot of Vegas-style gambling games and not a resource management  game.

Looks like it would fill a good spot in the collection - I think the theme would let it serve as a gateway game for some folks as well.

Reading Blott's comment on this game makes me want this it even more - a satisfying and varied experience for everyone, every play.

Great game, made better with real poker chips.  Seems like it would play best once all players have several games of experience.

Got too few plays, sold through craigslist on 9/14/12.

A Vegas game without any Vegas games managed to grab us! I would definitely play this again, although the competition of it felt more you-against-the-game than it did me-against-the-others. In most rounds, it felt like we were all pursuing our version of winning the game, instead of trying to snipe one another.

IF you like Roller Coaster Tycoon, you'll like this.  It is something of a cross between Volle Heute and Princes of Florences.  However, the gaming theme is lightly pasted on, and you could be laying out a sewage plant just as easily.  Sadly, the components are not quite what they ought to be, and the player "boards" are particularly flimsy paper.  Still, I enjoyed this little trip down the strip.

Other than "paper " player mats/boards, good components (I'm looking for a solution for new mats). I'm using my nice poker chips instead of the ones that come with it, gives a new feel to the game. Tiles could have been a little thicker but good. Not hard to learn and the auctioning can be very fun. The puzzle aspect of trying to fit everything is great. Easy to learn and not long games.

This is a proof that Americans just don't know how to make eurogames.  This game really wants to be a one, but is uninspring, completely lacks originality and seems forced.  There are some meaningful decisions here, but complete lack of innovation and - above all - finesse, puts me off.

The trick to Vegas Showdown is figuring out what the relative value of each tile should be.  This takes a few plays and makes it difficult for a first time player to win.  However, there is still a high fun factor and even if you lose you can still take satisfaction in your hotel/casino.

The keys to winning are to manage your money well, not overpay for tiles, and build smartly so as to optimize diamond patterns.

I highly recommend this game with anywhere from 3-5 players.

Good enough.  I like the tile-laying mechanic a lot - I actually screwed up and backed myself into a corner on my first play (which I almost never do in a game like Alhambra); yet with careful planning you shouldn't run into anything too painful.  (To be fair, I was playing the early part of the game very aggressivley, for economic reasons . . .)

I've played games with better auction mechanics.  This scratches the itch, but I'm sure the auctions would be better with five.

Played 2-player with Doug Adams's variant: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/107951

RATING: 7
Don't let the cheap components and bland art scare away potential players - Vegas Showdown is a game that mixes tense auctions, the puzzle of arranging tiles on a grid, and money management in a satisfying way. Players must focus on their timing as they try to grab new tiles at a bargain while fending off competing planners for the more prized-additions to one's casino resort. The rules are a little tricky to explain and the game can come across as a bit dry, but Vegas Showdown is unique enough that I keep it in my collection.

Really solid game. Scratches the same itch as CALIFORNIA or ZOOLORETTO or the other floor planning games, but with more player to player interactions as you duke it out in the auctions.

After a number of plays, my rating has gone down slightly.  I find the game is a Princes of Florence style tile placement game combined with an Amun-Re/Evo bidding system... and the strategies can be very subtle.

My only problem with the game is that there are just too many options available to players in the early game... there isn't enough bidding competition.  Players usually get what they want, so it then boils down to who benefits the most from the random events cards.  Restricting the number of premier rooms in the early game might help solve the problem.   The mid-to-late game can get quite competitive, however.

Still a solid 8.

Solid game with auction, resource management, investment, and tile placement elements.  I think the luck in the event cards adds to the replayability of the game rather than detracts from it.  Without the event cards I think the gameplay would become scripted and formulaic.  Very approachable and friendly game - I think its a good game to use when you have players who have been exposed to some of the lighter euro-games and they are ready to start bridging over to some of the heavier euro-games.

Frankly, I think if this game had been put out by a famous Euro game designer, shown at Essen by one of the big companies there, it would have alot higher ratings -- the fact that it's an unknown US designer, that its theme seems a bit light, and that there are unfortunately quite a few "Eurosnobs" out there has caused the ratings to be quite a bit lower than they should be.  In my opinion, the only Essen game from 2005 in the same ballpark would be the much-appreciated and over-hypped Caylus; everything else I've tried falls short.  Of course, compared to Caylus, this game gets no respect, perhaps because people look at the title or the box art and don't give the game a chance--thereby missing out on a real gem.Sure, it is derivative of several other games, but it all fits together in a nicely-themed package and, because the order of the event cards differs, that means every game is different and I have seen different strategies prevail.  I find this game appeals to a broad spectrum of gamers, from the very casual, social gamers to the very hard-core strategy gamers.  I will be keeping my eye on Henry Stern to see what he comes up with next, because this is an excellent product that has got quite a few plays since I bought it 2-3 months ago.

One of the particularly satisfying things about this game is that you must balance your floor traffic against your potential revenue. Some attractions bring in more customers, and some allow them to spend more money. Your income at the start of your turn is always the lowest of the two, so you have to plan your expansions carefully. Much like Princes of Florence you must manage your casino's physical layout (although in this game you have limited options for "renovating" your casino and changing the layout).

Vegas Showdown features a Puerto Rico-like mechanic where tiles not taken (or in this case, bid on) become more attractive the following turn (the minimum bid degrades from turn to turn, unlike Power Grid or Scepter of Zavandor where the minimum bid is fixed). I found this added a lot of excitement to the game, because it's possible to grab buildings "for a steal" or to pay huge sums of money, and both can be good moves. I also like that the game caps bidding (the caps are fairly high), so that near the endgame players have to consider the possibility of being shut out by the turn order (first player can plunk down the max bid, ending the auction immediately). Finally, Vegas Showdown features an end-game condition similar to Stone Age, where there are three stacks of high-end casino improvements dwindling at different rates. Here, however, those rates are randomly determined by cards that flip up each turn, and not by the players.

I think the cards will make the odd game of this feel more random than it ought to be (persistently rewarding one player or punishing another, seemingly regardless of planning), but that's unusual and really not an issue. 

Update: I've cooled a bit on Vegas Showdown as my gaming experience has deepened, but even so I find it hard to fault the game. It is a very solid offering for newer gamers, or perhaps all but the most experienced / hardcore gamers. For me I don't feel like the game involves much in the way of problem-solving or creative maneuvering. A straightforward, well-made game of snowballing and optimizing. Given the time-frame and style of auction, Homesteaders may obsolete this.

This is a game of building a casino by bidding for the components against the other players. There is a side for slots and a side for restaurants. The rooms affect an income marker and a marker for maximum income. There are bonuses for filling all of a side or for connecting all the way across the casino. There is some unpredictability as some cards give bonuses for meeting goals that you don't know until playing the game a few times may be important. I enjoy bidding games and this is a good one.

RATING: 7.5
Some have criticized this for using so many mechanisms from other games.  It doesn't matter.  The heart of the game - in maximizing points through tile purchase, selection and placement, is to my mind original, and the game does not obviously play like any other.

If there is a weakness it is that it can be SO puzzle driven - lining up the doors, tiles, and bonus corners - that it can suffer from some AP, or from a case of over pre-analysis, where experienced players can have all the bugs worked out, leaving new players behind in the dust.

Still, I feel that the game has some unique economic and tile laying challenges and I enjoyed my first playing quite a bit.

This is the best game you can find in such an ugly box and with such a horrible theme... except perhaps the old versions of Acquire.

I refused to play this game of months simply because the box and theme were so repulsive to me, but I own it now so I guess that goes to show how solidly enjoyable the actual game play is.

It's a bidding game, and a set collection/tile placement game.

This is the first true economic game that I've played in a while, but I wasn't too taken by it.  The game play is a lot slower than it should be, and the competition is only lukewarm.  This could be good if played by a cutthroat group of gamers, but I'm not sure that I'd actually enjoy the game then

Take Amun-Re (the Knizia one), transfer it thematically to Las Vegas, add some more auctions, remove some of the tightness, introduce event cards and you end up with Vegas Showdown. While Amun-Re is the deeper game, Vegas Showdown is more accessible, thematic and "fun" while clearly remaining in the Euro domain. A good game, might even be a bit better.

So fun! I like building up my empire in front of me. The first 3 times I played this game, I played incorrectly thinking that you collect income before each individual person makes a bid, therefore, I hated it because everyone had too much cash and there was no point to bidding. Once I figured out what we were doing wrong, this has become top 5.

March 2017: 

Good game, but solved. Bidding mechanic should be used in more games. Probably best bidding mechanic I've seen.

Now here's a theme that turns me on: hotels and casinos in Las Vegas. We're going to Vegas, baby, Vegas!! This is actually a fun game of development and auctions. Bidding strategies are interesting as you decide between cheap basic developments that will pay off over the long haul, or sexy glamourous developments that pay off big but also cost big. There's a event deck that causes some unpredictability. Nothing new, but it works and has a fun theme.

RATING: 5
The Vegas theme kept me away from this one for quite a while, and I can't honestly say I'm all that sorry it did. It's Amun-Re meets Alhambra, and very little hilarity ensues. It's certainly OK, but I'd rather play either of the obvious--and obviously superior--progenitors. I'm also slightly put off by the less-than-stellar components from Hasbro. I guess I shouldn't be surprised, but if you're going to rip off good hobby games and still charge a decent sum for it like this went for upon release, I'd prefer something a bit nicer than mats that won't really lie flat, ugly poker chips, and overall boring art design.

I can see where all the "copycat" comments come from.  The auction style is similar to Amun-Re, the tile placement is slightly similar to Alhambra and Princes of Florence (in that there are restrictions and bonuses attached to good placement), the tile rearrangement is similar to Alhambra and Palazzo, etc.  But all these recycled mechanisms still work out to be kind of fun.  The event cards seem to be a little too random, I don't mind them that much but can understand why some would not like points being randomly handed out.  I have no love for Las Vegas at all, but the game is fun to play and seems like a much more approachable way to ease non-gamers into more complicated games.  The familiar Las Vegas/casino theme is less threatening than Renaissance Europe.  I think the components are somewhat disappointing.  Using a folded (?!) paper for your own player mat is annoying and unnecessary these days when so many German games have very nice, sturdy individual boards.  But overall, my opinion of the game is pretty positive.

A hand management game with an [b]odd theme[/b]. It's tempting to put down lots of tiles in the beginning, but in the end, it's better to well-placed quality tiles.

[b]Easy to pick up and play[/b] in the beginning. The strategy is more apparent as time passes.

RATING: 6.5
A pretty ordinary bidding game about building up a casino. A little reminiscent of Princes of Florence but quicker and a bit more random. 

I think what I did not like with this game is just that there isn't enough money to make the bidding interesting. Income is so slow that players have to "waste" turns to collect enough money to be competitive. And because of that, the bidding isn't as tense or as competitive as it could be.

Overall, nice bits, some interesting cards but crappy player mats. Probably best as a beer and pretzels style session.

Fantastic game.  Plays relatively quickly with tension building to the end.  Should appeal to both gamers and non-gamers.  Game is better with 4 or 5 players.  It is a shame about the player mats and misprinted room tile.  Second edition fixed the misprinting, but did nothing to upgrade the cheap components.  Were it not for the components this game would be a 10.  This great game deserves much better.  Maybe an expansion too.

RATING: 7
This game uses the Amun-Re bidding mechanism (nothing wrong with that, we should see it more often) to establish which rooms to build in your casino/hotel. It involves a bit of a planning puzzle. My main concern is that it gets repetitive and goes on longer than necessary. As well there might be a runaway leader problem as gaining a cash advantage early (through savvy bidding and turn income) is reinforced. As well, the bidding decisions don't seem particularly difficult. This game may serve as a reasonable introduction of non-gamers to meatier Euros although I am concerned that its repetitive nature could eventually turn them off. Vegas Showdown is not as similar to Princes of Florence as people seem to think. It has auctions but no actions - placement only matters in PoF if you are a heavy builder. The puzzle aspect of VS is closer to Alhambra. * Update: I enjoyed it more with 4 people than 3 and have raised my rating from 6 to 7. I am happy to play it but I don%u2019t currently want to own it. * Update 2: After one more play I have decided to buy it. Even though it does not meet my usual purchase criteria (rated 8 or above by me) it should work well with non-gamers - runaway leader is still a problem though - I suspect the early slots are usually underbid.

Went over surprisingly well with my group.  Have only gotten 5-7 plays in at various times so far (I have finished middle of the pack each game :( ) so rating is tentative.  So far, was a hit and most people truly enjoyed and requested again at another date.
I like the floor plan aspect and the end-game goals.  The cards make for some chaos, but knowing that ahead of time doesn't detract at all.

I enjoyed playing this game.  Unlike distant cousin "Princes of Florence," it seems that it is often important NOT to buy a piece and instead hoard your money for one of the high VP/income/population tiles down the road.  The high VP tiles seem very important.  I'm still not sure if the game is unforgiving, i.e. requires extremely careful cash management, or chaotic, i.e. simply subject to the whims of the tile draw.

Took me over three years to get this to the table. 
It's my highest rated game that involves tile placement.

Game with explanation took two hours. If we can't get this down to the advertised 75 minutes it takes too long for what it is.

What it looks like after one game.
It's accessible to non gamers imo. Perhaps a little too light for the people I play with in Mol.
It offers some interesting choices. there is however a considerable element of luck involved. The tie that won the game was drawn in the preultimate round. Noone would block or otherwise they certainly would come in last. As chances were extremely high the game would end with two stacks depleted.
Because of the setup and the game works replay value is pretty high.
However and this is a big however. I don't see anyone I play with requesting for this again. Infact I can find another game for most situations that I would suggest first.
Also you could buy for ten money 5 VP. If you didn't have money since you triggered that to come up (like me) you didn't have a chance to buy this cheap.

I know that my complaints about the game are things that you could use to your advantage to some extent. But in the end if your very special upgrade building doesn't come up well you probably won't win. If it comes up you are in a strong position.

Not to be confused with the newer (and better) Lords of Vegas, Vegas Showdown is an old Avalon Hill game that's about resource management and arranging tiles on a grid. The player interaction comes mainly in the form of an auction every round. It's somewhat primitive by today's standards, but it gets the job done.

[2008.Jan.18] A surprisingly good Euro game combining bidding and tile placement mechanics. The "casino building" theme makes the game approachable to all.

Two minor quibbles:
(1) Personally, I could do without the random event dictated by the card (although using the card for refreshing the special tiles is fine).
(2) Also, the game can end rather abruptly, leaving players with too much "cash in hand" if they did not purchase tiles in the previous turn.

That said, these are rather minor quibbles against a game that can be quite fun to play with 4- or 5-players.

Several games.  All crankiness during my first game aside (there are some players I should NEVER play with), this game was much better than I expected.

Has a similiar bidding element like Amun Re and fill-your-own-tetris-board like Princes of Florence and the you-need-this-prerequisite-building of Neuland.

Didn't play this game for a long time since I've heard it compared to PoF quite often and I figured I didn't need to play a clone.  Stick with PoF.  I found out the first time I played incorrectly and the spatial elements I thought existed in this game didn't actually exist in that you don't have to line up doors as long as you have access to the room.  There really didn't seem to be many challenging aspects to the game as there was always something handy to bid on in the auction.

I have said it again and again, I fucking stink at spatial relations, and going through the motions for a spatial relations game is just not that much fun for me. I understand there are other elements to the game, but I just look and look at the pieces and can never decide what I should buy, or where I should place it. The bidding mechanism is kind of run of the mill, and the various ways to score points is okay. Overall though, the game just doesn't do it for me.

RATING: 8
This is a very interesting bidding and building game.  The scoring system is sufficiently convoluted to make it difficult to gauge exactly how much one should bid on the key items up for sale on a given turn.  The process of laying out your casino efficiently is a fun "game within a game" as well.

What a neat little game! One of my biggest surprises ever, a game that seemed silly and shallow before I happened to acquire a copy through a random trade, turned to be a highly enjoyable experience. Add an easy to digest theme, extremely smooth gameplay, simple rules and multiple layers of (light) strategy and tactics and you get a real delight. I just wish some of the components were better - the paper sheets are utterly horrendous, and the blue and green pieces are easy to confuse with each other.

RATING: 8
While it’s not as good as Ra or the hypothetical, idealized version of Saint Petersburg that resides openly in my head, Vegas Showdown is a pretty good middleweight gamers’ game. It’s possible that it has been overlooked by gamer snobs like me a bit because it was released by Avalon Hill/WotC, who made some dubious production decisions to cut costs/retail price. If you go past the superficial issues, though, VS fits in quite nicely in the eurogame ouvre.

The systems are tight and clean and the randomness is well-calibrated. The auction system, while reminiscent of Amun-Re and (the much later) Homesteaders, it is still distinctive. While the event cards are a tad more random than I’d like, and the tech tree doesn’t quite rise to the level of creating distinct strategies (the game is still primarily an exercise in tactical optimization) the overall experience is fun enough that I want to play again.

Recommended if you like middleweight euros and auction games.

Runs a bit too long and is pretty abstract, but I think the bidding plus tile placement is pretty well implemented. I like how the minimum bids decrease if no one bids on the tile the previous round, and that the tiles are different sizes with different doors, making placement a bit tricky later in the game. The events while luck-driven I think are necessary to give this game some semblance of variability from game to game.

An interesting and somewhat unique game with a strong theme.  You bid for tiles to improve your casino and hotel.  As you add tiles, they score reputation points, add guests, or money.  Each turn as special tiles are acquired there are new cards flipped which determine which new special tiles come out and affect the game rules for that turn.  

I really like this game.  The only down side is some really lame components.  They are acceptable components but the quality is really poor compared to other games out there.  WotC republished a few years ago and never upgraded the components.  It is almost family friendly in that the mechanics are easy.  It has a great auction mechanism.

Rules suggest removing 3 of each basic resource for 3 players this just seemed to make them run out quickly. player with the slots strategy ended up with. Much more money and won comfortably. Probably needed to do more renovation to improve things. Also had arbitrary end point which meant other players not completing sections when they had tiles in stock to do so. But fun game.

A decent game of tile-laying and bidding,  vegas-style.  Feels kind of like monopoly, if monopoly wasn't so freaking simple.

RATING: 7
The puzzle aspect is very enjoyable, and almost everything else works very well: the VP/income dichotomy, the detoriation of prices for less attractive stuff, even the event cards. However, the way that the tech tree works is a bit problematic, since the order in which a crucial tile appeary can completely make or break your strategy.

This is certainly more a matter of taste than a real deficiency, and taking big chances is, of course, thematically very appropiate in a game about Vegas. Nevertheless, it relegates this game to a very definite second place when compared with Amun-Re with its similar auctions. There, the dependence of dynamics on the player group instead of the tile draw gives a depth and tension to these auctions that, for me, is not matched in Vegas Showdown.

Those looking for a Vegas-style game should look elsewhere.  The game is more about strategic tile placement to gain points.

Rating is from the initial playing. This definately feels like a Eurogame, even if from an American publisher and designer. This game was a BIG hit with my wife, sister, brother in law and nephew (and me of course). Immediately , a 2nd game was suggested - even though we had no time to play it. The auction mechanism is nifty with the prices dropping each turn that that particular casino piece was not purchased. Definately a fun game and I can see this one hitting the table a lot over the next few months. Kudos to AH for producing this fun game and I recommend grabbing a copy before it is out of print. I got two copies at Tanga.

Update: In our last game everyone had played at least once, so the playing time was right and everyone knew the event cards and so on. This is a good game that I enjoy, but I probably won´t suggest it more than four times a year or so. It´s almost a pure auction game, so it may feel a little samey after a while. A great feature is the minimum bids and the fixed intervals in auctions. This makes it a lot easier for players to decide to bid or not. It speeds up play and I believe it makes players more satisfied with their auctions. I´m a little suprised by the high rating here on BGG. I´m settling for a 7,  "Good game. Usually willing to play. I might even request or recommend it.". Btw, if you don´t like it the first time, play again with the same people or others who have played at least once before.

My first comment: A nice mix of auctions and puzzles, with fixed price intervals, dropping prices on unsold stuff, and a bigger luck element than many auction games. I like it, but playing time has been a little too long so far. I will probably enjoy the game even more when it gets shorter. As in many auction games, it´s hard to know what to bid for, and how much, in your first game.
We play with real poker chips, which adds a lot to the feeling.

Best with 5 says BGG poll.

In Vegas Showdown the difference between winning and losing is your ability to pick up the good deals when they happen and being flexible enough to use what is cheap efficiently. Try not to get low on capital too often or you will not be able to capitalize on the deals when they come up. Still my favorite implementation of bidding in a board game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I am starting to see the allure of this game.  At first glance, it appears that strategic bidding is the key to winning, but I don't actually think that is the case.  Sure, you want to underpay for your properties while forcing your opponents to overpay, but to me the bidding component is not as important as timing.

Timing is important in a couple of ways.  First, you want to ensure that you have enough money to cover the purchase of an important tile while your opponents do not.  So, if you see your opponent's bidding on tiles and depleting funds you might choose to bide your time and pass, taking the single victory point.  Then, after receiving your income for the next round you will be in a better position to strike.

Also important is the timing of the endgame.  You may wish to prolong or end the game depending on the current layout of your board and the relative positions of your income and population.  Given that there are a number of ways in which the game can end, you can often time the ending of a game to your advantage.

One complaint I have about the game is the seemingly high luck factor with regard to the event cards.  In a recent game, a card came out which paid 3 points per restaurant.  I had three while some opponents had none, giving me a quick 9-point cushion.  That card could have just as easily been the one that gave victory points for slots, which would have reversed the result.

A good light auction/building game. The component quality is poor which is the only big negative thing in game. Combines somewhat successfully Amun-Re-Alhambra-Florence into well-themed package.

Feels rather simple and obvious auction game at first, but every further play proves this wrong.

Easily playable with children or beginners.

Seems like a good game, but suffers from a little dryness somehow.  Maybe playing with 5 would give it more "juice," but it felt more solitaire than Princes of Florence.

Theme is fun, but the components don't really pay off on it. OK, the cheapness of the parts didn't help, but it lacked a "human" quality to building a casino.  Maybe if they had more illustrations of customers inhabiting the rooms...something so it didn't feel like putting together empty rooms.  Perhaps a royal treatment with plastic 3D slot machines, a bandstand, card tables, etc. would make it seem more compelling.

Overall, not a bad game, but one I had higher hopes for.

RATING: 8.5
Game in a Nutshell: Bid against other players 'room  for room' to build the best designed casino.

Played as: 4,5 player

Pros: Quick to learn, fast, and little down-time. It retains its interest for the length of the game due to the fact it's more about getting the best option for your money from turn to turn rather than simply building a path to victory early and 'auto-piloting' through the later rounds. The careful attention needed in laying out your casino compliments the money-driven auction mechanic well. The theme works in a way that game-play makes sense.

Cons: I really had high hopes of the auction in this game driving the suspense and fun, but with so many items to bid on and an easy money-saving options out with the promotion or renovation, the game felt more solitaire then it should have.

Other: I explain the chinsy paper playing mats as 'blue-prints' and haven't heard a complaint about cheap game components. And why should I? The game is easily found for as cheap as, or cheaper, then most card games (Lost Cities or Battle Line = $20; Vegas Showdown = $10).

Best Use: Border-line gateway game or as a quicky, non-filler. More players is better.

Use your turn to bid on items to fill your casino-hotel such as slot machines, buffets, lounges, etc. You can outbid other players or use your turn to just take points or renovate your casino. The strategy is deciding which items to collect and where to place them in your hotel-casino for optimum layouts and points. Some items you bid on advance your score while others advance your income in each round and/or population. Takes about 10 minutes to explain and about 45 minutes for an hour to play. Easy enough for the light gamers but also has enough variety and strategy to keep more serious gamers interested. A group favorite.

A good example of its genre.  Player aids have an excessively small font.  I'm not too sure about the random events (they were interesting, I just prefer games without such events).  People often don't have enough money to block others from buying moderately expensive tiles; I think the game would be improved if there was more money in player hands and players were adverse to spending it (possibly worth more fame points).

More a light economic management game than a bidding game; too many good action to choose from *removes* from the tension instead of adding -- picking one good action from among several isn't that hard. I like what they tried to do with the tile-laying, but I feel it was a missed opportunity; it would have made more sense to have every tile have one or two red triangle to add more tension in the placement; as it is right now you just have to put two red triangle tiles next to one another, wihout having to think about it too much. The tech tree is a good idea, but since all players will eventually end up with one of each base card (slots, restaurant, lounge), this is again a bit of a missed opportunity. Overall this is a decent familly game that can serve as a great stepping ston to heavier management game (ex: amun-re, goa). Be warned: godawful components.

A good auction game but don't expect any gambling.  Players are trying to build the most profitable casino hotel by bidding on rooms to add to their building each round.  The auction mechanic is borrowed from Amun-Re.  Once a room is purchased one can place it onto their player mat as long as they follow the placement rules or place it aside to add later (similar to Alhambra).  There really isn't much new to this game but it's still an overall fun, solid gaming experience although not extremely exciting and could use a bit more tension for my taste.

While this game may be a little lite for some of the members here, I found it to be very enjoyable and is a potential new gateway game, along with Settlers or Carcassone.

Nice intro to auction mechanics.

I love the tile placement in this game. It's a puzzle within the game that I always marvel at. The auctions are generally intense bidding wars and there are so many ways to win, it's rediculous.

RATING: 7.5
Vegas Showdown is a sort of light-hearted plate-juggling game. There are two income tracks to keep up with, and you can't forego either. Linked to each are a precarious balance of space-filling and tile-laying that is surprisingly more difficult to tie-in to the income-generation puzzle than you'd think [the best tiles rarely fit where you want].

There's a lot more planning ahead in the game than most people will credit it for. The events, since the deck is so small and you see so many of them, are more predictable than you'd think at first [after a few games, the only real question is when certain things will happen]. The "A" and "B" tile stack separation is a really good concept.

Holding out [on both other purchases and in filling in your casino grid] and hoping the Dragon Room or Five Star Steakhouse or Space Age Sports Book come out both before the game ends and at a time when only you can capitalize on them is a lovely tension that runs throughout the late game. The game reveals better depth with more plays.

Vegas Showdown is about building your own casino. The game makes use of an auction system to secure key elements that you want to build (Slot Room, Roulette Tables etc). 

The other key element of the game is very much visual/spatial as the players aim to place the various rooms they acquire according to a set of building rules. 

Points are earned for things like the variety of rooms, having rooms of certain sizes and hoe the rooms are built in relation to one another. 

It is a very good design that probably doesn't get enough love but it was good to see the game get a reprint.

A really great gateway game to auctions and tile-laying. This game has my favorite style of auctions, where you can rebid once someone has outbid you on an item. After a number of plays, however, the game does feel like it plays on autopilot a bit. The events help mix things up a bit, but the game mostly plays out the same way. You may not get a casino the first round, but you probably will in the next couple of rounds. Not as tense as I would like it to be.

Prefer Princes of Florence in comparison.

Ouf!... Ennuyant, laid, matériel de piètre qualité, design de la boite digne des années 80!... 

On attend quelques tours avec un coup de "publicité" (??!) parce qu'on n'a pas assez d'argent; Puis des événements nous empêchent de réaliser l'achat désiré. La joie!

Certains le comparent à Alhambra; je trouve que c'est une insulte! La variété des tuiles et la compétition pour acquérir tuiles et argent è Alhambra n'a rien à voir avec Vegas Showdown où il n'y a que 15 tuiles différentes et 12 d'entre elles exigent 3 prérequis, où on se demande un peu à quoi sert le plus avancé de nos marqueurs "argent" ou "population", où des cartes d'événements aléatoires altèrent beaucoup trop le jeu même si ce n'est que de façon subtile...

Je ne rejouerai pas à ce jeu. Et les gens avec qui j'ai joué ma partie ont à peu près tous été eux-aussi assez ou très déçus de ce jeu.

I was not expecting much from Vegas Showdown, despite all that I had heard.  I am not a huge fan of lighter games, and anything that is described as a gateway game usually isn't enough for me, with some notable exceptions.  Vegas Showdown is just such a game.  Like many of the games I really enjoy, I came away from my first playing believing that I had a lot to learn about this game, and that I wanted to learn more.  It is a great blend of long term planning and short term decision making.  There are many equally effective strategies, and the decisions are really interesting.  The theme really does a lot for me too, and it certainly enhances the game.

My only real complaint with the game is that, because of the way the end conditions come about, the game can end very prematurely.  When this happens, it feels like you've been cheated out of the full experience.  This isn't something that happens very often, because it requires the cards coming up in a certain way, but it does happen some times.  In addition, it really pays to know the distribution of the tiles in the A and B stacks, and this is really something that they could have added to the reference card.  But these are minor quibbles in what is a really excellent game.  And given the wide availability and incredibly low prices, there is no reason why you shouldn't pick this one up right away.

In Las Vegas, players start with an empty player mat. Each round, flip a random event card, then bid for available buildings (slots, lounges, restaurants, etc). Player score bonus points for filling sections of their player mat, have buidings in a certain configuration, have the most revenue, have the most workers, etc. It has a good theme and is fun to play.

This game has some good aspects and some poor implementation. It's undeniable that arranging the pieces on your card is fun, but there's not a whole lot of skill involved in their placement. The bidding stage is fun, but eventually becomes repetitive and lacks the luster of further depth (say, negotiating during bidding for future promises?) Lastly, the game itself is quite unbalanced and the scales can tip quickly and perniciously. 

May I say, also, that it would have been nice to see some more theme added to it? I mean, "restaurant," "table games," etc. that's as creative as it gets? And there's no real benefit present in designing a decent casino, pack the thing with twenty restaurants and one slot machine and you could be well on your way to victory.

RATING: 5
A fairly good and enjoyable theme.  In essense it is a bidding game.  Money is pretty hard to come by, but this makes the bidding element a bit more intense.  There is a tile placement strategy to the game, but really this part is quite simple and not a major factor in the game.  Doesn't require too deep of thought to play.

A nice middle-weight bidding game. I do think it needs the maximum number of players to show its true colors - with 3 or 4 I would only rate it a 6. I would have also liked better player mats - the flimsy paper boards you get are not up to par.

The reviews are more or less accurate.  There's not much new here, but the tried and true mechanisms are put together into a very solid game.  The spatial problems of building casino are a bit unique and do affect the decision making quite a bit in the late game.  Some concern that the event cards may swing things too much in certain circumstances, but I'll give it the benefit of the doubt for now.  It does what it does very well.  I can see this getting bumped up to a 7 if it shows longevity, but not higher than that.

---update---
Definitely a 7.  Plays quick, and the spice of the card draws is a fun addition for an auction game.

Classic.  The way it plays is much more fun than what the rules or the board aesthetics would suggest.  Quick and fun.

Update 1:  I think the existence of this game on my shelves is being heavily threatened by Castles of Mad King Ludwig, a game that I don't have yet, but uses the spatial positioning of acquired-via-auction pieces in a much better, cooler and rewarding thematic setting.  Who would want to build the inside of a casino vs the inside of a crazy castle?

Still a solid game, but since it is old, it was bound to be improved upon by another game at some point in time.

I really like this game. Rules are straightforward and it's painful enough to decide whether to buy/bid something now or perhaps wait for next round where it might get cheaper. Only thing that slightly bothered me is that actions cards (esp. ones that give VP's) can make quite big swings in score. Once you know the cards you of course know what to expect so the problem is milder than I first thought. There is a healthy amount of luck in there but it fits the theme well and hasn't bothered me since that very first game. A very good game that works best with either 4 or 5 players.

Another auction game for optimization freaks. The auctions are not very tense, and the game is seriously lacking fun, too. And if you get left a little behind, there's absolutely no way of catching up. 

Very cheap components and very poor graphic design.

I really want to give this a 7, but the disappointing components keep me from doing so.  Otherwise, it's a reasonably good game.  I'd say that you should purchase it if you find the theme appealing.

Well Vegsas Showdown, you have Step Auctions, Tile Placements with "road restrictions", Victory conditions, and methods to enhance income/visitors... 


On paper you could be a perfect game... and don't get me wrong... I enjoyed our play, and if we happen to run into eachother on the table, I'll be happy to play you again... it's just, how can i say this... i don't know if there was a spark between us... you're a swell game and all... but i guess what i'm trying to say is that you might not be hearing from me... unless it's hell`a late, and i have nothing better to do.... (did i just say that?)

Recomended: Kind-of... this is an "easy" gamer game

RATING: 3
This game has a nice theme, a great weight to playtime ratio, and a few neat ideas with the tableau building in front of each player. I like the event cards as they force you to build as evenly as possible to try to hit every scoring opportunity. 

But... the auctions have no tension. There are far too many things available each round. Even the highly contested slots have two bidding tracks, as if the designer was afraid of making the game too confrontational. You are always succeeding at something, where good tight auction games let players fall on their faces when they bid poorly. This is a pansy auction game for pansies. Why would I play this when Taj Mahal is about the same weight and time slot?

RATING: 7
I quite like the constrained nature of the play. The limited number of auction pieces and the set start prices ensure a normally fast resolution resulting in speedy turns. There are lots of things to compete for in order to gain VP's and this means people can follow different routes, so there are 'few' critical auctions that are must-win. This perhaps give a lack of tension that the premier auction games give, such as Princes of Florence, but this makes no apology for aiming at the lighter end of town and there's still plenty of interesting decisions to make.

Cool Auction, Tile-Laying, Economic, Casino Building Game ! Easy to learn and teach. Reminds me of a lighter Homesteaders without the trading and debt. We enjoy a 2-player variant.

The tile placement has a "tech-tree" and have orientation restrictions, which can add to AP durations. Needs a couple plays to really dig into the strategies.

Gateway game! Casual Game! Beer-N-Pretzels Game!

Splendid combination of known elements.  Especially like the gradual lowering of prices ala Queen's Necklace.  Gift to Beth M; David F; ?.

RATING: 7
What I like:
- The auctions are important, but they are "loose" in that you can usually get your second choice
- The spatial "fill your hotel efficiently" aspect is great
- Pretty simple rules, so easy to teach
- The 2p variant on BGG works really well

What I don't like:
- Flimsy player mats and cheap poker chips
- The scarcity of slots may cause early-game angst among new players
- My first 3p learning game ran a full 2 hours, and seemed to drag on about 30 minutes past when I was ready for it to end, but I forgot to remove 3 of each basic tile, which may have extended the game. My next 4p game (with 2 first-timers) took 90 minutes, which felt like a good length.

This seems like a pretty accessible "buy stuff at auction for points" game, but has a bit of engine-building as well (income early, VP late). So far, the 2.4 weight seems about right.

After two plays. It took a medium length of time to play (2hrs). Experienced players liked it even though it involves random events and random tile availability. The player viewing the board from the top edge could not see all the bid tracks. I thought the pieces were cheesy but the group thought they were fine.

A combination of Amun-Re, Princes of Florence and Alhambra - and the mix works very very well. Seems balanced and offers lots and lots of meaningful choices. The randomness of event cards seemed bad at first, but when you know what's in the deck it seems a very good mechanic.

I suspect that a lot of eurogame lovers are put off or misdirected by the Las Vegas theme and Avalon Hill label.  Your task is to build a casino/hotel complex that generates the most revenue and attract the most visitors thereby earning the most fame.  All to whom I have introduced to this game have been impressed.

RATING: N/A
first play, 5 players.  everyone approved of this cheesy looking, but well designed game.  It feels like several of my favorite eurogames, and it incorporates elements of Amun-Re (auction mechanic), Princes of Florence (tile placement on player mat) and power grid (sequence of tiles up for auction).  Overall, a very smooth and fun game to play with five.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Being a Hasbro game, this one really surprised me.  It combined Amun-Re style bidding (which I love) with a tetris-like placing tiles on your board.  Since it's difficult to move your placed tiles, you have to plan out what you want to do to get the best configuration.  Yet at the same time, you have to get the right tiles to manage your income.  This is one of the few games where I've found that there's a real trade-off between getting VPs and building up your economy, even early in the game, because points are so valuable.  The game also places a lot of emphasis on saving your money and knowing when to jump in and grab something big.  A great game, overall.

I like the game's mechanics and theme, however for implementation of the theme, I was disappointed.  Vegas is all about the gaudiness, flash, attractions, and one-up-man-ship.  While I loved the auctioning and laying out your casino, the other stuff really needed some chrome or different benefits to make your casino better and different.  I don't see why they also didn't add anything for the outside attractions similar to the Mirage volcano, Treasure Island boats, Bellagio fountains, etc.

A basic auction game with very little extra in it in my opinion. Of course there is also architecture aspect present in game - but I wouldn't bother thinking about it...
I played this game with three. Of course it was too few but I only wanted to test the mechanics. I understand that putting the game to its full glory needs probably at least four, but anyways: the auction system is too basic and uninteresting. There is a bit excitement with flipping the new buildings. A lot more different room options would have done it.

At any rate, this is one of those game you try perhaps once more after the first time to get the same opinion second time: an ok game, but there are so many better ones in world to waste my time on.

RATING: 6
Enjoyable game.  I equate it to "Puerto Rico" in that you have a gameboard of squares and you try to place the best piece (slot machine, lounge, restaurant, etc.) into each space in your casino, and some plays require another piece to have been played previously.  A big down side is that it is very cheaply produced.  The player mats are coated paper and the playing board is half the size it should be so it's very hard to read and doesn't reach closely enough to all players.  I have found the online version to be more fun than the board version.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a game I learned how to play online. It's quite challenging and I enjoy all the planning and puzzle fitting it takes to build your casino.

I still prefer the online version because it can get a tiny bit fiddly.

3/11/13 - This was fun at first but after a game with my group it seems super dry and boring. I am bumping it down from a 7 to a 6.

As you'd expect from a "Vegas" game, it's all about the bidding. You're bidding for building tiles to build up your casino and hotel -- trying to balance your services with your money while collecting victory points too.

RATING: 5
The Princes of Florence travels throught time and space, bringing Amun-Re along for the ride to experience the thrills of the casino. Yet this imaginative fusion of those two game designs fail to excite as much as the theme promises, despite the poker chips almost transporting you there. I think the reasons for no adrenaline rush is firstly all the info is out there, whereas I think to bring the theme home and provide some uncertain tension is that money should be secret. The only tense aspect is the game ending when a certain pile of premier tiles are exhausted. And it is the event deck which detracts some of tension as it undermines the thinking and until you are familiar with the deck contents expect a rocky ride favouring some and leaving some not wanting to visit Las Vegas again.

It's challenging to try to build your tiles in such a fashion that you are prepared for whatever you might purchase in the future.

A simplified Prince of Florence meets Alhambra.

Has a nice mix of mechanics.
A good auction mechanism the allows for a bidding war or some extortion. Like the decreasing initial bid for the special tiles.
Tile laying so you have to biuld a route through your rooms and the layout of rooms can affect your score. Resource manangement as you have to trade off between fame (VPs), money and visitors.

Even at the end you can enjoy your creation.

Anum-Re, but faster paced and more streamlined.

This game is *so* Euro.
* Multiple scoring tracks to pursue: fame (points), population, or cash (where your income is the lower of population or cash)

* Random event cards that apply to everyone
* Multiple ways to trigger the end game
* Individual player boards (or in other words, reduced player interaction)
* Huge variety of ways to score

I'm simply tired of these kinds of games, the auction for tiles-slash-knowing when to convert money to points kind of game.

What a great combination of mechanics and theme! I thoroughly enjoy the balance and variability of this game. This game does what other economic/building games *cough* Puerto Rico *cough* don't - provide every player with a balanced building market that they can build to their preferences and react to the changing market of other bids and what tiles and cards come up. Noone can choose Captain in this game and ship your resources out from under you. Someone building a Nightclub doesn't stop you from scoring Fame with your Fancy Lounge. 
It is much better designed than Princes of Florence or Alhambra, which it shares some mechanics with. 
This is the kind of Euro-inspired game that I've been looking for, as a longtime Ameritrash fan. 
  
*updated* I've raised this from an 8, to a 9, to a 9.2 and I think it will stay there. This game kicks ass, and is one of the most underappreciated games on the Geek. It is in the Top 125, yet little discussion compared to its empirically strong play & balance.
Everyone that likes bidding/building games should buy this game asap before this excellent game goes out of print (was as cheap as $4!).

RATING: 7
A pretty good auction and developement game. You have to balance increasing your income with population, concentrating on one becomes worthless. With several ways to earn extra points at the end, knowing how to prepare for it becomes the key thrength to the game.

Both of my games were played with 5, so I'd like to see how fewer players will affect gameplay. Having only 1 track to bet on slots will have a decent affect, I'm guessing.

RATING: 8.2
Very fun with loads of player interaction, long-term and short-term strategy, tough decisions, variety, a little luck (but NO dice or playing cards, despite the theme!) and challenge. You can tell a good game from the length of the 'what I should have done' conversation after it's over, and this one certainly meets that requirement. This game is great. About that "75 minutes" thing though - for a 5-player game, better allow 2.5 hours.

RATING: 9
A very accessible game, particularly with the rather distinct (and fun) theme. The mechanics, as has already been pointed out numerous times, are indeed not particularly innovative; however, the chaotic event cards (something not typically found in the straight-laced euro) are a welcomed "Americanization". Personally, I find this game pound-for-pound more enjoyable than some of the more lauded titles.

RATING: 5
o.k. this game isn't terrible, but it's not that great either. the main problem with the game is that it is missing any element that would set it apart from any other o.k. auction game. it just lacks that certain spark that makes a game beg for repeated play. maybe the problem lies in the fact that bidding process seems kind of artificial, since the bid increments are predetermined. The auctions never feel that exciting. people keep comparing this to princes of florence, but this feels more like alhambra with auctions.

I've only played this game once. I don't see myself playing it unless I felt like playing a bid-war game. I did enjoy the game at first but toward the end I wanted it to just end and I didn't care if I won or lost. Not the mark of a great game.

We seriously screwed up the rules on my only play of this game.  I will update my rating and comment after I the game play properly.

Here's what I like about the game after having played it incorrectly one time. I like the way the auctions work especially the way that you can purchase something without having the ability to immediately put it in your casino.  I like the way the bidding works for the premium tiles.   I love building my casino.  Vegas Showdown is satisfying in the same way that Agricola is satisfying in that when you are done, you can sit back and marvel at your paper casino.

Great auction game, works well with 3 but shines with 4 or more. Very tight gameplay. 
Auctioning + tile collection and layout (as in Alhambra). Tile placement restrictions (premium vs. regular tiles, connectivity to hotel and casino entrances, etc.), working towards endgame scoring bonuses, and balancing between victory points, population, and income makes for a very fun game.

RATING: 7.5
This game was surprisingly simple and satisfying.  We all enjoyed building the casino and trying to anticipate what other players are going to bid on.  Save your money?  Bid on the premium tile?  Publicize?  All good choices.

The components are soooo bad.  It definitely doesn't look good on the table and all the pieces feel gross and lame.  So lame.  The game is crazy fun though.  What a shame!  If they remade this game with cool components this game would be unbelievable as a package.

If you get hung up on how pretty a game is, you won't like this.  If you can get past the look and feel and just enjoy great decisions, you will like this.

Although there aren't any staggeringly original design ideas here, Vegas Showdown is a surprisingly engrossing variation on the auctioning/building game.  It doubtlessly helps to have an unusual theme for what is unmistakeably a Eurogame.  It's a neat dilemma that the points you need to win the game (Fame) are utterly useless during the game, and the points that help you along the way are of minimal use at the end.

Light, fun version of Princes of Florence.  I think the theme is well implemented--it's fun to try and build a "dragon room" into your casino, or a "5-star steakhouse"!  The theme is even better if you use good poker chips.  I enjoyed trying to save up the right amount of money at the right time, getting the right timing to my assets, the price of what I wanted, and my opponents' maneuvers.  The spatial puzzle is minor but a good fit for this weight category.  Just like Princes of Florence, it's a little solitairish for my tastes.  The diamonds annoy me--they don't fit the theme at all, but I guess I understand their purpose in giving a strategic element to the spatial puzzle.

Enjoyable light bidding and tile laying game. Many ways to try and gain the lead with money to outbid, fame to win, and building your casino to make the others try and keep up. Very enjoyable game for both gamers and non-gamers with the social aspect being the best. 
After about 5 games this has become my favorite bidding/ middle weight game. Plays good with three to five.

We have played it once and enjoyed it.  Seemed hard to make a bundle of money to invest in costly rooms without falling behind in the building of rooms.

Others love this game in my group, but I just don't do well in it, so it lacks the flavor they see in it. I'd rather play amune-re and princes of florence than this one, but it hits the table every gamenight at least twice. They would give it a 10.

RATING: 8.5
I love the way the auction is done in this game, with pre-set bidding values, and a starting bid dictated by the inherent value of the tile, but going down each turn that the tile is not bought.  Open money, so no AP or memory about how much you need to bid to beat someone - simple do you want to low-bid and hope you get it or guarantee it with a high bid?  The managing of both income and population is really good - similar to Suburbia, but perhaps less choice since in VS you simply want to raise them both at the same rate, whereas in Suburbia you usually go high income first than pull up Reputation later but other strategies are viable.  But it is quite similar to Suburbia in feel, and partly because of the better component quality of Suburbia, better playability at all player counts, and the great expansion support (Inc. mainly), I would usually always recommend buying Suburbia over Vegas Showdown.

I like this game.  It's light, quick to learn, easy to understand, and fun.  The components are horrible, though.  But looking past that, I enjoy the gameplay mix of bidding, spatial planning, and building.  The bidding mechanism is the same used in Amun-Re, and I think it may be my favorite style of auction.  


My wife didn't like this game at all; I would've kept this if she would've played it with me.  I actually miss the game now.

Is Homesteaders a meatier replacement for VS?  I want to find out.  I found out:  no.

I can see the Princes of Florence comparisons I guess, but its a pretty big jump for me. They both have auctions (though very different) and tile placement (which is again, very different) This game is a lot lighter than PF, but I really enjoyed it. Ditch the plastic poker chips and use real ones and it makes is a better experience. Good game for the 10 bucks I paid with shipping.

A játék megkapta volna a 8-ast, de egy dolog nem tetszett benne, az esemény kártyák között van egy pár ami győzelmi pontokat osztogat különböző felépített termek után. Ezekre a kártyákra minden játék előtt fel kell hívni a játékosok figyelmét, mert könnyen a győzelemre segíthetnek. Az első játéknál az egyik játékos (mindannyian elsőre játszottunk) folyamatosan kapta a nagy bónuszokat a kártyák után (szerencséje volt) és meg is nyerte óriási előnnyel. Közte és a második helyezet között volt vagy 25 pont, utána már csak 1-2 pont különbségek voltak. Gyors, pörgős játék. A licit része is jól működik, csak a játék végi pontozásnál volt furcsa, hogy olyanokért kaphattunk bónuszt, amit könnyen meg lehet csinálni. A kijáratok összekötése, a hotel és a casino területek lefedése, ezek szinte kötelezően teljesíthető feladatok. AZ utolsó három játékos között a tulajdonképpen a rombuszért kapható bónuszok döntöttek. Majdnem az összes épület felépült, lehet ha hamarabb létrejött volna a játék vége feltétel, akkor a bónusz pontok sem ilyen egyértelműek mindenkinél.

A light game that plays quite quickly.

I'd play this again, but now that everyone has a copy, I'll probably leave mine in shrinkwrap.

2/17/09: Played again, I really like this game! I wish I hadn't given my copy away since it's out of print now. I bumped my rating up to an 8.

Vegas Showdown -- Played once; four-player.  As I listened to the rules, I was concerned, but play was straight-forward.  Various paths to points.  Theme matches well.  I was surprisingly pleased.  

I must say, however, that while some game components are of high quality, others are distractingly poor.  Avalon Hill's choices in this matter puzzle me.  The color cardboard box insert should have been either a molded plastic insert customized for the components, or it should have been left out entirely.  The chips are unimpressive, and while they bring casinos to mind, they're unnecessary.  Paper money (or more preferably cards) would have worked for the investors' capital, and might have cost less, allowing Avalon Hill to improve other components (like the remarkably flimsy player mats).  Still, these are minor issues, and when the price for the game made a steep drop, I snapped up a copy.

While the name of the game implies high stakes and gambling with your luck, actual gameplay provides little of these feelings. However, Vegas Showdown is still quite good. It's fun to construct your casino and hotel and allows some planning ahead to make things fit just the way you want them too, though this isn't difficult by any stretch. I typically don't enjoy auctions in games, but Vegas Showdown's auctions are managed quite nicely. Possibly redundant in feel with Alhambra.

[1 play] Avalon Hill jumped into the euro design market with this one and in 2011 I finally got around to trying it out. Aside from some weak components, they did a nice job with the design and have produced a clever game with tension and interesting decisions throughout. I do see the comparison with Princes of Florence, and while I don't think Vegas Showdown is quite as strong of a game, it has a slight edge in accessibility to new players. I don't need this game in my collection, but I'll happily play it again many times (and do better at creating diamonds next time.)

Most recent play Cabin.con 2011 with Garrett, Michael, and Corey 1/14/11.

RATING: 6.5
A pleasant middleweight diversion. This game really is a mishmash of systems: auctions ala Amun Re, tile laying and rebuilding ala Princes of Florence and Alhambra. Players are casino builders and bid for buildings to place in their hotel and casino areas. These buildings in turn provide VPs, increased money and population. When the game ends, bonus VPs are awarded for the usual suspects: most money and population, filling up both the casino and hotel as well as connecting both sides.

The game's flaw is that it's too pleasant and generic. Auctions are hardly cutthroat as there is always usually an option for players. The package works but isn't entirely exciting. I forgot about the game 2 hours later! The components aren't that great either: hokey poker chips, thin player sheets.

Interesting auction and tile laying game.

I've received this one in a math trade and was so excited to get it to the table.  I figured a Vegas theme was enough to convince my poker group to play it, even though it's not really about gambling at all.  A set of nice poker chips to replace the cheap plastic ones made it even easier.

The game is a blast to play and moves quite quickly.  The cards make the experience different each time and can throw a wrench in even the most well thought-out machines.  As time passed and with a few plays under my belt, this crept into my Top 10.

Very good game - very enjoyable for everyone.  Good 3-5 player game.  Scores have ranged from the highs of the 90's to the lows in the 50's so there is a high variance in our games, which is a good thing.

Update - still underrated on BGG, this game features some auction mechanics, economic balancing, and a spatial element as you create your casino.  There is some luck in how the cards come out and how the buildings come out, but that makes for a different game every time.  That's a good thing for me.

Vastly superior to anything I imagined it to be.  This is a fun auction/building game.  There are some random elements that are probably going to ultimately result in one person winning the game so hardcore Euroheads that detest luck may want to shy away. For me though, I feel the game itself is strong.  I understand how some people have compared this game to Amun-Re, Princes of Florence and Alhambra, but I quite enjoy the game despite disliking the games that it is compared to.  The auction is more of a dutch auction rather than the auction in Amun-Re, the goals for others are clearer than in Princes of Florence and the Tile Laying and aquisition of tiles in much more compelling for me than in Alhambra.

Get it while it's cheap.

First few plays were highly enjoyable. I love the Amun-Re-like auction mechanism. There are loads of way to score and the theme is original.

Looking forward to play again!

Vegas Showdown was designed by a Magic: The Gathering card developer under the Avalon Hill label (primarily known for war games), which was run by Wizards of the Coast (primarily known for high-fantasy), who is owned by Hasbro (primarily known for mass-market games).  

Nothing about would lead you to believe that Vegas Showdown is a solid Euro-style strategy game, but it is.  It's got economic engine building, low individual luck, multiple paths to victory, and Euro-style game mechanics, while also layering on an American theme and a random event deck.

It works great as an intro-to-medium strategy game.

RATING: 6.2
There is enough here for its easy rules, lightness of play and enough interesting choices to make this a worthwhile game to get to the table. There is something about it, however, that makes it easily slip from memory when thinking of games to suggest to play or recommend - there doesn't seem to have that spark to make it really memorable for me.

RATING: 6.5
Now that I know how much I love auction games, I'd have to give this a second chance.  The components are ugly and the "building a casino" aspect doesn't appeal to me much, but I might move this up if it gets back on the table.

UPDATE: Finally got this back on the table, and I did like it more, although the components are still ugly, the theme is still so-so for me, and I struggle to get engaged to play it.  Nevertheless, it's not a bad game, and I'm much more willing to play it in the future.

There's nothing innovative about Vegas Showdown, but it's a good euro.  The auction mechanic will be familiar to anyone who has played Cyclades or the originator, Amun Re.  The rest of the game is a familiar mix of engine building and tile-laying on individual player boards for end-game VP bonuses.  There's no reason it has to be Vegas-themed, but it's reasonably well done aside from the production quality, which is not.

I'm probably being unfair, but I expected a more Vegas style game with a gambling aspect, so I was disappointed.  The game is a bit on the dry side, especially considering the theme.  Still, I enjoy economic/auction games enough to give it a lukewarm thumbs up.  I'm not one to complain about components usually, but I thought parts of the game board could have been better designed, such as the casino auction tracks being partially obscured by the tiles.  Also, the board you use to place your tiles was rather flimsy.  I expected better given the price tag.  Update:  I'm still horrible at this game, but I'm beginning to like it quite a bit.  My rating my go up even further.

I'm not sure if I like or not this game. It has basic mechanics, well implemented, but dull choices IMO. Auctioning and puzzling are player's only choices and, if some choices can be interesting at some point they also can be innocuous: first because players often don't have money to make valid choices and secondly and more important, there are some events that prevent too many stuff. If these kind of events could actually work to raise bids higher and eventually turning the game (auction) more interesting for some available things, it would be nice but mainly the game becomes shorter in options and with the obvious choice even more obvious.
Overall although it's not a bad game, I found it boring and long.

This game doesn't offer much you can't find else where in a better package.  There is really no tension and interaction to the gameplay.  Seems contrary to what a Vegas theme would imply (it would also imply gambling, but this game tries hard to give a Euro feel).

What a very simple, very fun little game!  There are several reasons why "Vegas Showdown" is now one of my top choices for gateway games: it is remarkably simple to learn, it incorporates a few different and fun mechanics (economy, bidding, tile placement, etc.), the auction mechanic is straight-forward and does not require a previous knowledge of the "value" of the items you are bidding on (as with other games, such as "The Princes of Florence"), and it is fun for more experienced gamers too.  The components are fairly decent (with the exception of those dreadful paper player mats), although it's more fun to substitute quality clay poker chips for those plastic ones.  One thing I particularly enjoy about this game is the fact that there are many different ways to earn points, which seems to allow the pursuit of different strategies and multiple paths to victory, and which is not what you might expect in such a simple game.  And the icing on the cake: $3.00 at a thrift shop, complete and in apparently unplayed condition!!  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 7.5/10

This is a real gem of a game.  Why it doesn't get more publicity on the geek I don't know.  Some people complain that it's nothing more than a bunch of recycled mechanics from other games.  Admitidly it does borrow mechanics from some other games, but they all come together brilliantly to create a very worthwile gaming experience.  Simply put this game is a lot of fun with the feel of a Euro with a dash of chance/luck thrown in just to spice things up.  If you tend to like Euros but are a closet AT fan as well this game is a good blend of the two.  The only downside is the production value is lacking a little, particularly with the player mats, but you won't really notice as you get absorbed into the gameplay.  A great game.

[3 plays]  Initial reaction rating.  An enjoyable auction game.  I understand the comparisons to Princes of Florence.  It does have a certain feel and look that is similar.  It is more of a pure auction game than Princes is.  I think I have say I find Princes of Florence a little bit better.  I like the two actions you get in that game and that game just feels more calculating which I like.  In it own right this is solid game I and would have no problem playing this again if given the opportunity.  I don't think at this time though I will put this on my wishlist or anything though.  Well a decent game, I didn't really feel it did something extra special compared to other auctions games out there.

RATING: 7
[AH 06 edition] {Casio, economic, building; auction, utility cards, tile-placement} Vegas showdown is a nice economic and optimizing game. It's quite fun. Similar to Goa and Prince of Florence, there is nice interaction in the bidding and competition of tiles (other than that, each player plays individually).

It's multifaceted and moderately deep. It has a balanced design: no single tile is overpowered and no single strategy guarantees a win. Money is tight because of limited cash flows (a few event cards will generate additional income). Thus, overbidding is not desirable. Without enough money, players cannot purchase good tiles for development and cannot gain fame points (at game end and with some event cards). Deciding which tile to purchase is not trivial because each tile has different use at different time and under different strategies. There are some random factors in the event cards and tile draw but players still have good control and these random factors do not bug me. Actually, I like the random factors because each game experience is different for those. It's not as unforgiving as other advanced strategy games; players have chances to correct early mistakes. However, players still have to build their casino carefully because choosing too many Renovate actions is not desirable.

The casino building part is similar to PoF, though fundamentally different. I like the depreciation mechanic, rather than inflation of money like other games. VS has no novel mechanics but every element integrates seamlessly to make VS a very solid game.

The parts are below par in AH standards. They are effective and informative.  However, the player mats really scare me. Besides, I don't understand why only 2 player aids are provided for a 3-5 player games (and they are printed in both sides?!). The bookkeeping is quite fiddly and sometimes player may knock off markers and tiles in the player mat.

In all, VS is a very meaty family game with a strong theme. If you like Euro games like Goa, PoF, etc., you will probably like it.

After several plays this is clearly the best AH offering in a decade.  The game makes sense,  flows well, plays quickly, and the best player will win.  The end game condition is too random,  but no one seems to care when we play it.

A bidding/building game similiar to Princes of Florence and Amun-Re but with a bit more luck (event cards), which adds variety to every play session.  Game components keep this from being a 9 for me (wax-paper player mat instead of stiff cardboard, plastic chip-coins not marked with denominations, nubby edges on building pieces from poor die-cuts).  Regardless, the game is balanced and rewards players for nickle-and-diming AND saving for major buys.

Players compete to build the best casino.  On each turn, there is an auction to purchase different types of casino rooms from restaurants to game rooms.  Different rooms give different benefits such as increasing your income, population and/or fame.  Increasing income an population gives you more money each turn to bid on rooms.  When the game ends, the player whose casino has the greatest amount of fame wins.

Was expecting a middle of the road bidding game, but was incredibly surprised by how fun, challenging and strategic it is.  One of the best bidding game out there.  There is a few lucky events that can piss off some players, but if you accept to few randomness here and there, this is one exciting game to play.

We pulled this game out and after the first game everyone was immediately ready to play another game.

While personally I find it to be a middlin' effort, this is a great mass market bridge to euro gaming.  There was Vegas Showdown, Rocketville and Nexus Ops from Avalon Hasbro; a nice spread of hobby architypes, I hope of those that VS does best at WalMart and pries open the door...

What a lovely little gem. Bought this cheap and got my mom and wife hooked after the 1st play. The gameplay is very 'clean' and exciting whenever cool rooms turn up for auction, and when cool events happen that benefit certain players. And after the game, you can admire the lovely casino-hotel you've built in front of you. Definately a thumbs up for this game!

Vegas Baby, Vegas!  Cut Throat is the only word for this game.  This was my game store's best boardgame of 2005.  We all scoffed at this title when we first encountered it, it has since had more play then any other game in the store.  It doesn't do anything that other games haven't done before but it combines them all with grace.  This game is ALOT of fun to play.

Addendum: Just introduced it to some new players, MAJOR hit.  Although, I'm tempted to lower the score a little for really shitty box design and flimsy components that don't survive the beating they take.

What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, but what happens in Vegas Showdown ends up affecting every other game - it's a great, fairly easy to explain, auction game, and once people are taught this, you can refer to it when teaching almost anything else.  For 'dedicated' gamers, I think this game will soon seem dry, as most of the mechanics are done better in other games.  But for casual gaming?  My original estimation was way off, and I rarely see myself declining a game.  I originally rated this game a 6.5.  However, I have since raised my rating to an 8.5.  This has become a game that almost any new gamers will dive into and have fun with, and I really enjoy that.

I was surprised and really liked this game quite a bit - I wasn't expecting anything from AH/Hasbro. Too bad it doesn't play 2 (its 3-5). My other complaint? The cheap-ass paper player mats.

A terrific auction game that, unlike a lot of buy-and-place bidding games, creates some very interesting, meaningful and difficult decisions in terms of where to put casino upgrades once you've acquired them.

Played once 4-player and twice 5-player. Very fun auction game utilizes the Amun-Re bidding mechanism while players try to build a money- and traffic-generating casino and hotel. Players bid on various rooms (slot rooms, restaurants, lounges, buffets, etc.) trying to gain fame. Very challenging with lots to think about. I can see why it won Game Magazine's game of the year for for 2006. Probably supports 3 players equally well.

Vegas Showdown earns its place as an auction crowd-pleaser. Compared to most auction titles, it's easier to teach and the valuations are simpler to calculate.  However, Vegas Showdown is slow and the 1st Edition artwork is downright dreary.  If you like pawn-based auctions, try Nefertiti for a faster experience or Amun-Re for a deeper one.

This one is a Euro-style game that incorporates the theme pretty well.  I have enjoyed it everytime I've played.

Update:
I have more fun everytime I play this.  This is just a great game for me.

I like auction games, but they can be a little inaccessible to non-gamers because it's hard to value whatever's being offered. Because the starting bid and bid increments are already established it's easier to know what to do. That's a good thing.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 1

Well-themed combination of auction and tile placement.  The prerequisite tree and door placement gives you more to think about than just the auctions, and the event cards add some surprises along the way.  The player sheets are paper-thin, and I prefer playing with heftier chips, but the components are nice otherwise.  The player mats aren't even that much of a pain because they are very large and the paper is treated so they don't get too beat up if you're careful.

First Impression:
A simple elegant medium euro with bad components.

Pros: Its simple to play yet has tough decisions. It makes excellent use of auctions and tile placement and carries its theme through. The game flows well and has enough variety to keep you interested for the duration.

Cons: Bad components really detract from the immersion. May feel the same after several plays though I can't really testify to that. Hours fly with several players though I admit the game doesn't feel long while you play it.

I really liked this game. It's in a "category" I enjoy (med.euro with a working - or good in this case - theme) and I'd love to play again at any time. The only real issue is the components as the game is visually unattractive.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Nifty auction game.  Light enough for non-gamers, with plenty of theme to suck them in, but enough of a game to satisfy a gamer.  Such a nice in between.  I think it may hover between a 7/8 but thats ok.  Its fits that niche quite well.  Second play, it is a really good game.  Not a great game, but still quite good.  It has a dash of luck , which helps get this game on the table..   The mechanics are borrowed from other games, but the feel of it is quite unique.   It feels like a more approachable Princes of Florence.  

Its an odd beast.  I find it incredibly difficult to approach a value for the tiles at the stage of the game and "go from the gut."  I'm not sure if thats saying something about me or saying something about the game, but it is unique for me playing an auction game.

The best of the newer AH games to come out in awhile.  I love this game, it's a euro style game with American flavor.  Think Princes of Florence minus a bunch of the bog down mechanics that slow that game down. This game gets better with each play! 

UPDATED: I've had this game quite awhile now. I'm still playing it and teaching it to new people. I've always enjoyed it and bring it out to game days. Does this deserve a 10 too? 

This game has several 2 player variants and I prefer the one by Isamoor where you have 2 bidding pyramids and only 1 player board. Even that is lackluster to me though.

Really like the tile placing & auction games & you can't beat the theme as well!
My son just won a 5 player game with only 1 slot in his casino area.  He did connect and fill hotel, but took publicity a lot and bought big scorers.  Each time I play, we see more depth and strategy.
Keep playing this game & I wonder when I will tire of it?
I have tired of a 3 player game, but for 4 or 5 players I'll play whenever possible.

Players compete to build the most famous hotel/casino. Room tiles representing slot machines, lounges, restaurants, and other casino-related places appear on a central board and the players hold auctions to win the rights to have those rooms in their building, garnering them income, population, or fame. Bidding wars escalate, values fluctuate, and designers renovate until finally the hotel/casinos are put to the test to determine whose garners the most fame.

Ho-hum, another run of the mill auction game. Really, nothing new to look here. take it or leave it. Even though Vegas Showdown is rated very high on the geek, I don't think this game is really all that unique as there are many other auction type games. The bidding mechanism here is similar to Amun-Re, except Amun-Re has much more to offer.

The only twist to the game is the income and population generator. I like it that the income and population has to grow side-by-side in order to maximize income. That is unique. No run-away issues here.

I had alot of fun with this game.  It is a nice blend of different mechanisms.  Some people have criticised it for being derivative, but so what?  Inovation and originality make for a more impressive design, but not necessarily a better game.

I like the auction style from Amun-Re.  The price drop on each turn adds an almost push your luck feel as you try to hold out for a better deal and try to judge when other people are going to want to bid for items.  My favorite part is also the part that will turn off some people.  The event cards make every turn a little different and keep the game from being too predicatble.  The events affect everyone, but the wrong event at the wrong time can really mess up your plans.  Still, after two games, the score has been pretty close each time.

Cute, inoffensive little american euro. The length is just right and all the parts work. I think the only real flaw is a lack of tension, in that there are 3 more things to bid on than the number of players and not much pressure to get them immediately, as they'll only be cheaper later. In parallel, the casino theme also seems a bit watered down.

The bidding mechanic can make Vegas Showdown a nice contrast to other games in your library. Events can slightly hinder a player's strategy, but in most cases, they are not significant enough to force adaptive play. 

Renovating/rearranging your casino can be tedious, but it fits with the resource management theme. The artwork and design are ho-hum.

Overall, a decent offering, but not terribly exciting.

RATING: 7
Nice mix of bidding and building.  My casual gamer friends seemed to really enjoy this, which means it will be seeing more table time.  Players must balance overbidding for rooms that are in high demand or getting a bargain room that isn't as desirable.  The game end diamond scoring is a neat concept, but getting those special rooms is not always the ticket to victory.  One of the best Avalon Hill games that I've seen in years.  Player mats are pretty flimsy, but they seem like they will hold up well over time.

My gaming group didn't really like this game, and I'm not totally sure why. 

There are really two parts to vegas showdown. The first part is an auction to buy different additions to your own personal casino. Lots of player interaction and allows you to block other players strategies or just focus on yourself. Then the second part is the lay down the additions of your casino so that they fit accordingly and give you the most points possible. The game is easy to learn and fairly quick to play. I really enjoyed it, although I just recently purchased Cyclades which seems like it has lots of shared mechanics, but with a bit of a better theme. Time will tell.

A very neat auction game. It's a casino renovation game with a tech tree! This game has been a bit of a hit with the people I've played with. It has the feel of a heavier euro but is actually quite light to play. The only unfortunate thing is the misleading title and box that makes it seem like a gambling game.

I've only played this twice, but it's a pretty good game.  I love the "dutch auction" style (where minimum bids decrease when there is less interest.  The action cards add a little too strong of a random factor, but it's still good enough for me to rate highly.

An impulse buy that turned out to be a pleasant surprise.  Younger sibling of [gameid=555].  You're constantly evaluating what you can get with your money, and if it will be worth it.  Balance the quick grabs for fame with the ability to rake in the cash.  Auction mechanic is pretty neat, and the placement of the tiles on your mat is more difficult than it may seem.  Unfortunately, the bits in this one are pretty chintzy, an unfortunate pattern that the Hasbro iteration of Avalon Hill seems to be falling into.  I don't like the plastic poker chips much, the cards feel flimsy, and the paper player mats are downright inexcusable.  Even the tiles could have used a little nicer finish.  If you are lucky enough to find this for cheap, it's worth your money.

Ugh!  Rated a "2" rather than a "1" because enough people seem to like it so there must be a game in there somewhere but danged if I can find it.  They're more than welcome to it.  Even playing a game of Monopoly would be preferable to another game of this.

This is a clever blend of mechanisms, even if it does borrow heavily from Amun-Re, Alhambra, and The Princes of Florence.  The randomness of the cards is a little aggravating, in a "Fog of War" sort of way, and it tends to throw a tad more chaos into the midst of the game than I would like.  It plays quickly, though, and has just the right amount of depth for a game of its ilk.  So far, I'm pleased with it.

Players compete to build the most famous hotel/casino. Room tiles representing slot machines, lounges, restaurants, and other casino-related places appear on a central board and the players hold auctions to win the rights to have those rooms in their building, garnering them income, population, or fame. Bidding wars escalate, values fluctuate, and designers renovate until finally the hotel/casinos are put to the test to determine whose garners the most fame.

RATING: 6
This is a solid title from Hasbro's now abandoned Avalon Hill revival. Vegas Showdown packs a decent amount of strategy into a fairly simple bidding game. The puzzle aspect of maximizing your casino when buying and laying new tiles adds just enough complexity to make things interesting. The only real complaint I have about the game is the god-awful player mats. Seriously? Folded up pieces of paper? In a $40.00 board game!?! 

Thankfully I got lucky and managed to snag mine when it was being discontinued for $15...Still, it's pretty sad when a big company like Hasbro can't spring for cardboard.

The art on Vegas Showdown made me suspicious: cheesy, vainglorious, and slick. Hmmm, it's a game about casino building. Still, it delivers a fun bidding mechanic with minor events and tile-laying decisions worked in. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This isn't what I'd expected it to be. The sheer number of options available at any given time means that there is rarely any tension in the auctions. This feels to me more like a worker placement game with an added economic element than an auction game - which, in itself, means that on some turns you'll only have a handful of choices. There are meaningful decisions to be made, but luck plays a heavy factor in the value and order of both the event cards and the premium tiles. Overall, this isn't a bad game, and I do enjoy playing it, but I can't see myself choosing to play it over the other games in my collection if it were totally up to me.

A fun bidding game where each player is trying to build their own Casino and Hotel with slots, lounges, restaurants, upscale steakhouse, etc. The bidding choices are pre-set, which makes things straightforward. Your floorplan is important, as well as not paying too much for the buildings. At first you gotta focus on cash flow while the end game switches to victory points and bonuses.

Decent, but...nothing more. Clearly one where an accountant can, over time, glean fractional advantages, but is that fun? Easy to teach and play, certainly, but that's just not enough.

The chips are truly cheesy, esp. considering the glut of cheap but nice poker chips available just about everywhere. But most shocking are the wafer-thin player mats. They don't lay flat, they look and feel bad...having the end-game charts printed on thick stock was a bad idea because of the contrast with these flimsy things. Which one should be durable, flat, and easy to handle?

Vegas Showdown is a very good auction game.  I've read that its derivative, but as I haven't played many of the games it borrows from, it felt fresh to me the first time.  After quite a few plays of this with many different groups, I place it in the top-tier of gateway/next-step games.

In the beginning of our addiction we sometimes bought games to realize you need at least three people to play it. This was one of them, so unfortunatly this doesn't reach the table very often. But when it does we have a lot of fun. Quick, easy rules and interaction. Only the look could have been more luxurious.

Got this one through the Tanga deal for cheap.  It's surprisingly a very good game from AH with nice bidding elements and as good as any Euro on the market.  I originally didn't get this game as I thought it was about Vegas Gambling and luck oriented.  Boy was I wrong.  This one is worth getting if you like Euro style games.

A very solid auction game.  My only complaint are the wimpy paper "boards" for building your casino.  It would have been much better if they were cardboard as they would hold up much better over the long run.  That said, the game itself is very well done and worthy of many plays.

Okay bidding game where the mechanics match the theme pretty well.  Probably wont play again, mostly because a guy named Knizia has made auction games that do it better.  This isn't this games fault of course, just sayin.'

Edit: okay, I lied, played it again.  It was better than my first impression, but im not changing my rating because the theme doesn't grab me, and I generally dont like bidding games very much anyway.  Overall, this is a decent game, in my opinion.

An excellent auction game, with an Amum Re bidding mechanism. Trying to buy different sizes pieces which you have to place and rearrange in similar fashion to Alhambra. If it had been produced by someone other than Hasbro then I think the quality of the pieces would have been good too. I think the game can go on too long so best to remove some of each of the tiles go ensure it plays quicker.

Much better than I expected given some of the latest entries from Avalon Hill.  A pretty nicely done bidding game with nice choices and a theme that really works.  Also, very good for new gamers.  Not too hard to explain.  Only gets the 8 rating with 5 players.  Much lower rating with less players - you need the full complement of players to make the auction process really interesting.

Build your own hotel/casino by bidding against the other players to acquire tiles that represent slot machines, lounges, restaurants, and other casino-related places. Put those tiles on your player board, which represents your own customized casino. The tiles will allow you to increase your revenue, services, and fame.

The player who builds the most famous hotel/casino wins the game.

I think this is a great gateway game. You can get a bidding fix and a tile laying fix all in one game. It has some aspects of Princes of Florence but I like the bidding aspect much better. It has a nice mechanism so people have a good idea of the true value of something (the initial cost) so they don't totally run something up and put themselves behind. (Princes of Florence is such guesswork on the real value of something, new people usually get crushed. Not so with this game)

It hits the table a lot due to it's beginner friendly play and it includes enough strategy that it keeps me interested.

Played several times (with 3 to 5 players). Discovering this game was a pleasant surprise. I like the income-building process, which you have to combine with various geographical constraints (connections, doors, diamonds), as well as checking the progress and needs of the other players. It is a pity the individual board are so cheap, while the rest of the material is decent.

Still warming on this at this point.  Very Stone Age-y, but with a positional aspect of playing the tiles.  I think this is a game that'll shift with time, though I don't know if it'll go up or down.

Currently not available in collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Nice mix of strategy (planning future hotel purchases) and tactics (looking for the best deals). The only things that stop this from being a great game are:

a) Scoring is sort of fiddly.
b) Although you have choices that affect your future options, the different choices aren't really different enough to call them "multiple paths to victory."

But despite these two issues, everything else in the game works great, making this still a good auction+economic engine game. Worth picking up if you get the chance.

Feels a bit like Suburbia with Amun-Re-style auctions.  Vegas Showdown streamlines the aspect of Suburbia I particularly dislike: the constant updating of tracks and comparing against other players. The event cards provided occasional windfalls for some players – you could prepare for these ahead of time if you know the deck well. It's a decent game I'd be happy to play again but it's no classic.

Surprisingly impressed with the variety of options, interesting integration of the event cards, bidding and planning in this game. Timely theme based on the growing popularity of poker and gambling. Decent design, but poor component quality. The player mats are very flimsy, the larger cardboard tiles seem to warp horribly and the ultra-cheap poker chips for cash were disappointing. Still, lots of scoring methods, and it looks like it pays to be flexible while still offering a variety of approaches to take. Thoroughly enjoyed the game, and I could see playing this with a wide range of people... If the production quality were better, it'd go up to about 8.5 or so... Good "entry level" bidding game, with lots of variety and replay value due to the event cards.

RATING: 6.5
A relatively decent auction title marred by a misleading name and an uninspiring box design, both of which really does not do it any favor by making it seem like a TV game show reject in the vein of Deal or No Deal and Who Wants to be a Millionaire.  Vegas Showdown does borrow a lot of mechanics with nothing unique to claim, but I think it meshes them fairly well to provide a coherent experience.  The tight money management feel is especially welcomed as it often present one with the difficult decision of bidding low in the hopes of a great deal but also letting others with the chance to overbid you, or going high for a guaranteed win that will leave you broke the following turn.  The variable end scoring opportunities are a nice touch for those that planned ahead.

A good bridge for those tired of gateway games and want to try something with more substance.  I may play it occasionally but I prefer something meatier.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's certainly not a bad game, but I was expecting more from Vegas Showdown and in the end, came up disappointed.  A little bit of Amun-Re, a little bit of Princes of Florence with some other stuff thrown in does not necessarily an excellent game make.  I would've been really upset if I bought this game and paid half of the MSRP or higher, I can tell you that much.

RATING: 6
Light and simple, it's good as a gateway game and with the right mood (no deep thinking, just easy going tile placement) can be a pleasant filler once in a while. Quite simply, it never really caught my heart, wearing down quickly. The luck factor can be a problem, further exalted by a high number of players, but most of all its limited depth simply doesn't appeal my inner meeple, I suppose. And, of course, my overall feeling about this game is not even remotely biased by the fact that, the last time I played, a pretty lady heavily kicked my rear end twice in a row. 

RGG edition w/ River included. Tiles are sturdy and with a simple yet nice artwork, same goes for the scoreboard (large but going only to 50, not enough for a typical Carcassone game but also not a big problem, anyway). And then there are the meeples! Cute, highly symbolic for modern eurogaming, absolutely needed (and great) to keep yourself occupied during downtime.

Muy entretenido, facil de explicar, facil de comprender, barato, con muchas expansiones ya no tan baratas, rapido, rejugable.
Al principio quizas no guste, conforme más se juega más engancha, sobre todo si juegas con gente que sepa jugar y cortas las estrategias de otros jugadores.
Creo que es obligado para sobre todo familias.

Our beloved gateway game that sucked us into geekdom a few years ago. The quintessential Euro game and, IMHO, infinitely preferable to Settlers!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fairly light tile-laying game.  Random factor due to single tile playing.  But optimal play each turn is quite difficult to determine.  Farmers seem to be the key to winning, unless you get into a "Farmer war", then the city builder will win.

Just played this with 6 players and the Princess & Dragon and The Tower expansions.  They turned a nice game into something very nasty.  It was also highly random due to the 6 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Visually appealing and a very good entry level game if you can get people to understand the farmer scoring. All the expansions add some more bells and whistles but the game really is good enough on its own

One of my favorite games.  We had a Carcassonne themed wedding cake and my ring includes the scroll pattern from the back of the tiles.

RATING: 8
An easy to start game when you are new to boardgame. With the simple game mechanics, the play is mostly depended on the lucky draw tiles, strategic tile placement, and resources (meeple) management. While the game is fun when having more than 3 players, the game itself is very predictable on 2 players (given you can memorized all tiles)

Good to play with 3 or more players.

RATING: 4
I fundamentally love Carcassonne; it's as placid or as cut-throat as you want it to be, one of the few games I've known which fits that bill. As an added bonus, it's a tile laying game (which I love for some irrational reason, maybe the building aspect, dunno). Best played with around 2, maybe 3 expansions at a time and that's it. (Almost always I&C, T&B, and one other that gets changed out periodically). One requirement is having a hand though, if I can have a hand of 3 or 5 tiles to choose from and draw at the end of my turn, it's great. As the rules are, the order of draw and place saps the game for me too much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Carcasssonne is our go-to for bringing new people into the gaming fold. Simple enough to teach quickly. Good replayability. We almost always play with at least a couple of expansions, though.

RATING: 8
This is the game that got me into gaming in 2008. It has the right balance of luck and strategy and is infinitely replayable. My kids enjoy it immensely though my wife finds that there is too much strategy for her. The expansions (especially Inns and Catherdrals & Traders & Builders) add a lot to the game as well. If you purchase the game, make sure it includes the River expansion. If it does not then you MUST buy it. It makes the game start so much better.

I also recommend King and Scout as well as the Princess and Dragon expansions. They add new challenges to the game that are fun. With all of these expansions though you are talking about at least a two hour game so make sure you set aside the time. I love it!

I can never seem to draw the tiles I need to complete my city (or to stop another player from claiming it), but that never deters me from playing it. I find it just as much fun no matter how many players (well, 2-4, I've never played with 5) and it's a nice balance between simplicity and strategy.

Carcassonne. Tile laying is not particularly appealing meachanic to me. However, as we've got better we've discovered  that you can be far more confrontational (a good thing) and so it's growing on me. But there are better games to get to the table so it's growing slowly

2-5 players, the expansion Inns&Cathedrals brings in the 6th player. Suitable for a wide age range and can be played casually or tactically. You can ally to finish roads and/or towns together, or can try to outnumber the opponent and take all the points. The expansions Inns&Cathedrals and Traders&Builders are recommended and they add more scoring elements and more tiles.

RATING: 7
Carcassonne is a tile-laying classic that is one of our favorite games to introduce to new players, as well as a cut-throat two player slugfest between my wife and me. In Carcassonne, you are drawing tiles and laying them on the board in such a way that they connect smoothly with what's already been placed. 

You score points by building roads, cities, and monasteries out of the tiles you place. It's a simple concept, it's easy to explain, but there's a surprising amount of strategy and competition in this small game. 

My wife has proven to be incredible at this, always trashing me when we play with farmers, and often swooping in to steal my large cities when they're half-finished. I rarely win, though I often make it at least competitive. 

There are a few beefs with the game: most notably, without a hand of tiles to pick from, you really are reduced to luck of the draw. Additionally, monasteries can be a bit over-powered in the base game, and in a 2-player game the result will often tilt to whoever can draw the most monasteries. 

Carcassonne doesn't do all that much, but what it does, it does well. This is a great introductory game that has players competing to grab good spaces on the modular board. Carcassonne is a classic that I can't besmirch: it's well worth the little money it costs!

Carcassonne is perfect if you are looking for a strategy game that you can explain to friends in less than 5 minutes.  Very simple to understand, but still a lot of strategy involved.  

The big trade-offs in Carcassonne involve investing for the short-term vs the long-term.  Thieves have an easy short-term payoff.  Cities can involve short-term, mid-term, or long-term planning, depending on your preferences.  Farmers are the the definite long-term strategy, and if played well, players can rack up significant points with them. 

In most cases, it's unwise to play all short-term or all long-term; it's a game where you have to find a balance.  If you go all long-turn, you'll miss huge opportunities that come along.  If you go all short-term, you can get burned at the end. 

And yet in spite of all that strategy, it's fairly simple to explain and understand.  One of my favorites.

Fun tile-laying game, best with 2, and I suspect it wouldn't be worthwhile with more than 4 players. The Inns and Cathedrals expansion and the Mini expansion are both worthwhile additions. Traders and builders is also good but not essential. However if you add too many expansions the game can drag a bit...

Edit: have rediscovered the base game and have decided that it is complete as is.

A pretty but annoying game. Multi-player with newbies can be particularly frustrating as they get terribly excited about completing a tiny city worth 2 points without expanding it to earn the higher points....and do this consistently in front of you in the turn order. If it wasn't for the fact that the gameplay is simple and easy to explain (and that this therefore makes Carcassonne an excellent game to introduce to non-game players), I'd rate this lower.

A really fun game that has plenty of strategy and keeps you enthralled.  This game is not for the "elitists" who can't stand a game with any form of luck involved no matter how small.  I do however prefer Hunters & Gatherers as I think the scoring is a little more balanced in that one.

Carcassonne is a great gateway game, but can really drag when played with a lot of players or using a lot of expansions.

Abbey and Mayor is perhaps the best one to use.

I'll play this game, but otherwise, I'm not too wild about it.  Sure as hell won't own my own copy when practically all my game groups already have this.  I can have a casual, laid back game, but sometimes, it feels like there's too much pressure and emphasis to memorize tile distributions and card count, which would REALLY allow one to shine in this game.  I will acknowledge it's high ranking here and everywhere else.  The theme and game mechanics are splendid

(From Big Box 2009.)

2010-04-14 (rating 8):

The game is great! The rules are simple (not counting some bizarre expansions interactions) and yet the game is challenging and fun.

It can be played aggressively or calmly so should fit many needs. Due to large number of expansions a lot of options is available and the game scales well with used time (just a base game is short, all the expansions are long - it is easy to choose a combination which fits needs and available time very well).

However playing just the base game especially in more than 3 players may become somewhat boring and a bit too random after some time. But again the expansions are there so no problem!


Currently I prefer to use [gameid=45748] as the base game. Also I am testing a variant where one draws 3 tiles selects one and discards the rest back to the pool. This way the game is less random.

The more I play Carcassonne, the more I realize that it is a pretty good 3+ player game, but a *great* 2-player game.  It gets an "8" for 2-player and a "7" for 3 or more players.

Using The River (I) is good, and using Inns & Cathedrals really makes this a better game, especially if you have 3 or more players.

I'm still surprised by this one. I got it based on BGG ratings and praise. And I'm not at all disappointed. All non-gamers enjoy it. And gamers love it too. Simple - but just a touch of strategy. And MEEPLES! A few of the expansions are really nice and more tiles in general it a good thing (even though it extends the play time considerably). This games does not play well with more than 4 players. Really bad with 6 (so don't bother with that expansion).

Lovely game that can be fun and enjoyable or more challenging as you block your opponent's moves. Mostly play it 2p as it gives more freedom to do as you please. The river is a fun mini-expansion as is the Abbot/Monastery. I haven't gotten as into the Farmers but am looking forward to furthering my strategy by learning how to utilize it.

This was my introduction to boardgaming along with Illuminati. Still enjoying it.

2016-02-08
In many ways I regard Carcassonne one of the most versatile games of all time that fits almost any situation or group. It can be played with novices, kids and hardcore gamers alike. It takes only about 45-60 minutes, which you usually have at your disposal. There is a significant amount of skill involved but the luck of draw makes every game different and gives the less experienced players a chance. The game scales to all player numbers, although the more players the more chaotic and luck driven it becomes.

For its graphical design, Carcassone is great with all the necessary information clearly visible. The rules are fairly simple, except for the scoring of fields, and this is my biggest criticism towards the game. It is just a pain in the ass to figure out who has the majority for each city and it is even more difficult to explain this to new player, especially since most of the people who are new to Carcassonne are rather green with boardgames in general. The solution they came up with in Carcassonne Hunters and Gatherers is much more elegant and intuitive.

Another minor thing with C is that once two players share a city or a road, neither of them has an incentive close it, especially in two player games. This has also been fixed in Carcassonne H&G by introducing the gold nuggets and bonus tiles into the game.

Carcassonne can also be expanded with a myriad of expansions. Personally I deem the base game the best with maybe the one or two of the first expansions thrown in at max. You still want to have a rather compact experience and using too many expansions will just make to whole game too convoluted and away from all the fun.

I'll be happy to play Carcassonne any time but my personal choice is the H&C version of the game, since the problems have been fixed in it and H&G needs no expansions.

one of the best gateway games in existence. Highly recommended to get some more gamers on board :) After the first few months of boardgaming one will rarely go back to play Carcassonne. Loads of expansions for everybody. Generally not very long, but towards the end the downtime tends to go up rapidy. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Whilst this is a good game, it's far from being the best of the Carcassonne series.  It's historical importance to gaming is large and I will normally be up for a game of it, since it's a lot of fun (esp if you play with everyone always having a tile in hand to speed it up). Hunters and Gatherers is a better game because the forests are less fiddly than the cities, the rivers allow for better scoring than the roads, and (most importantly), the meadows are not likely to be as sprawling as the farms.

But, let's be clear here - this is the first of a series of superb gateway games.  I'd rank the best of the series right up there with Ticket to Ride - and much better than Settlers (but then again, I don't like Settlers at all, so I'm biased there). Art is good and to play it at its best you need to throw in at least a couple of expansions - esp with 4/5 players.  TBH though, this is better with 2-4 players.

I will state though that even on the first play, I did see a problem with the  the endgame in particular. Despite not having any Cloister tiles in a four player game (and thus lagging behind as those tiles are a real boon to pick up), I still won because at the end, I drew a tile I needed to connect an extra meeple to a HUGE farm that I was equalling the control of. This enabled me to win the game, scoring a decisive 40 points.

It seems to me that at the end, you can either draw such a lucky tile, or you can draw rubbish.  Similarly, if you draw no Cloisters and then also draw badly at the end, you will have no chance of winning.

So, I enjoy the game, BUT H and G IS more balanced and better at the end and The Castle is more cerebral (although it's only 2 player).  Haven't tried The City, but that may well be wonderful...

Wow... just wow.  I played this for the first time today.  Honestly, just from hearing what the game would be about, I wasn't too keen on it.  Building cities? Connecting roads?  Gah, boring!  But now that I've played it, I don't even remember what I thought of it before... it has been erased with the awesome that is the game.

Sure, I didn't win, it was only my first time playing, but it is exactly the type of quick game I like to play - the laying of the map tiles is very much like a puzzle, and I was able to screw-up my husband, not once, but twice with a single river placement.  That alone made the game for me.  Well, that and messing up another one of his cities later in the game...

I really like games that have a visual matching aspect - probably because that is my strong suit.  Anyway, long story short, I now need this game, so that I may thwart others in the building of their cities and cloisters!

So, my husband and I had a rematch.  He was well prepared!  I was winning for most of the game, but at the very end he surpassed me with with farms!  Gah!  Now we will have to play again...

Carcassonne's rules (farmers etc) are more complicated than those of many other games. however, it's a game more appealing for the family (including kinds) than for groups of gamer friends.

I'd give it an 9, but I got spoiled with the easy scoring online (www.asobrain.com).  An added plus for this game: my wife loves it :)

I've bumped up my score due to my son's absolute love of the game.  It's the first game he's started to regularly ask if he can play with both me and my wife. Curious if he'll do okay once we add in fields (he's six, so we figured that was a bit much to add in off the bat).

Great tactical euro game that looks deceptively simple. The only real weaknesses are the lack of theme and variety once the main mechanics and tactics have been learnt. Also, to play the game well you need to learn the tile distribution somewhat.  The expansions are hit and miss, and some players will get frustrated by the tile draw.  Put a bidding mechanic in for tiles, e.g. suburbia, and it's a much better game.

Do you remember your friends from kindergarten? Remember how you couldn't wait to leave the house in the morning because you were still working on that airplane to fly to the moon, or to see that invisible squirrel again, or to finally convince Ms. Miller that beans actually can grow out of children's ears? Do you remember how you were entirely convinced that life will always stay that way and you will always be friends, solving the worlds mysteries together?

And do you still see your friends from kindergarten? Well, to be honest, I don't. My kindergarten friends were great, while I was at kindergarten age. Life was simple. Planes that were made of cardboard were able to fly you to the moon (and back). But by now, life is more complicated, and suddenly cardboard airplanes are ... well ... basically just the cardboard wrapping that came with new fridge. 
It is the same with Carcassonne (and Settlers of Catan, really, I don't see a difference). It was great starting with those games, they defined a whole new world while that world was new. But by now, so many other great games are out there, and Carcassonne and Settlers are ... just cardboard. Nice, lovely cardboard full of good old memories, but basically just cardboard.

Oh, screw it. I admit I do miss that squirrel.

It's a great little game with virtually no set up or clean up time that can be enjoyed in a small or large amount of time depending on how many tiles you use.

A great zen masterpiece. Essentially a puzzle you play and score, Carcassonne is an easy to learn, simple game great for newbies or anyone looking for a light and enjoyable quick-playing title. The River addition provides a nice starting point and "trunk" for the map to build off of. I have yet to meet anyone who didn't grok and enjoy Carcassonne within 5 minutes (it probably takes less than that to explain the rules in full). It isn't Pandemic or Twilight Struggle, but there IS still strategy, and an experienced player will squash new players most of the time.

6/2015 - This one is a continuous hit at VP gatherings.  Had a play with dad, Steve, and Kelly at Christmas and dad, Steve, and Wesley at the VP open.  The variant where you pick up your tile at the end of your turn really sped up gameplay.

Pick a tile, place the tile and decide whether to place a meeple or not - only at the tile just placed. Also, a meeple can only be placed on an area without any other meeple connected to it. Choose the meeple's role - either a thief, knight, monk or a farmer. Score points by completing certain requirements and also taking back the meeple - each player only has 7 meeples.

Think strategically before placing the meeple. Or else, player may end up with no meeple. Also, high chances to sabotage another player by either not letting them take back their meeple, sharing the scoring with another player or totally snatch the player's score away.

Smart and unique game.

this is a very fun game that changes with every time you play. any age can play (with in reason ppl, don't let your infant play of course). very light but still chalk full of decisions that can cost you points or give you the critical lead late.  one of my must have games.

It's a Euro: pasted on lamebrain theme with a mechanic that resembles a puzzle and is kind of fun a few times.  It's not something I look forward to playing all week.  It's more like, "Hey, you want to play Carcassonne?"  "Sure, why not?"
At least that's how I look at Euros.  If Euros are your thing, then you will probably dig this.
It's not bad, but there are a lot better choices if you have the time.
I traded it because I got Carcassonne: Discovery, and it was a lot better game at doing the Carcassonne thing.

moving this to an 8. This game is not complicated but its beautiful. I can pull this out with gamers and non gamers and have a great game. When I finally talk the boyfriend into playing a game this is probably what he will be ok with. its short and light with a fun strategy. there is a reason its still being recommended 10 years after release. I suggest getting inns & cathedrals at least!

Although if you play with your partner it can be a deal breaker depending on the relationship :D Lucky for me we are as ruthless as each other. Not sure if that's healthy or not ;)

RATING: 6
It's gone down a little in my estimation, but it's been a long time since I played more than two players.  It's gotten boring because I play far more aggressively than my regular gaming partners.  It's a good game, just not a good game for us.  I won't turn down the offer to play it, but I don't expect anyone to suggest playing it any time soon.  

It also just doesn't compete well against alternative choices. Taluva and Carc: The City shunt this to the side of my game collection.

Not sure why I like this one so much. I actually own the "Big Box" which includes several of the expansions. Other people who like the same sorts of games I do usually don't like Carcassonne, as it can be a bit random. But it's quick and strategy is somewhat important, and my whole family enjoys it.

I haven't played it 2-player yet, which should be even better, at least given what I've read here on BGG.

Good game, but I am not sure why.  The strategy seems haphazard and win or lose I can&#039;t seem to figure out why I win or lose.  However, my family loves it and even my kids can win at this one.

Muller Exklusiv Edition

Carcassonne is a light game. It doesn't offer a great strategical depht but surely some cool tactical choises. The luck-factor is clearly there, but the skills of the player are still predominant in my opinion. Yet... what I enjoy the most about Carcassonne is watching the landscape take form as the game progresses. I like seeing "what we built" at the end of the game, before putting the tiles back in the box. 

Overall a nice little gateway game that I enjoy. After a 20+ plays I still like it, but it seems that I'm less and less interested in playing it...

Rating without the expansions: 6

One of the old time favourites. It is the father of tile placement games, with easy to grasp rules. You simply pick a tile and place it. The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etc. Then you may place on of your meeple and score or hoping that you will score later on. No wonder it is one of the biggest seller boardgames.

I appreciate the elegance of Carcassonne, but I never have very much fun playing it.  There's plenty of strategy and decisions to be made, but the random tile drawing means your strategy usually has to be reactive instead of planned out to any real degree, and the decisions are more often meaningless than pivotal.  It's fun to watch the map take shape for your first few games, at least.

RATING: 7
Even though the theme is the quintessential quaint, the clean colours and emerging pastoral setting is a joy to behold. Each tile feels like an opportunity and the shared act of creation always makes me feel warm at the end of each game!

Mechanically, there's much more going on here than most people see. Quick scoring seems best, but this is a game of investment and particularly a game that shines when players 'speculate' by trying to share features. Farming can be a little hard to understand at first, but it provides a necessary strategic element and high-level risk appraisal in permanently placing workers. 

Dynamically, this game is an investment game. It might mitigate a lot of the risk with seven workers, but that's exactly what I want to be able to play with friends and family. So many other games with this dynamic are all-or-nothing or involve intense diplomacy; Carcassonne is a game where you can just plod along making a pretty landscape or play hard and share or block other player's development proposals. 

Overall, this is a deserving legend of boardgaming. It was probably my gateway game (at least, it was the first game I played when interested in board gaming as a hobby as an adult). I think most people have played it, but it's still a winner with most people who haven't been exposed to modern board game designs.

HOW I LIKE TO PLAY: I prefer 2er, where we only play with [thing=2993][/thing]. I'll extend to three players with [thing=2591][/thing] for a less provocative game, if we're new to gaming ;). Beyond three players, it's a bit too tactical for mine, but for an easy evening with casual gamers, this is an absolute go-to game.

[With River, River II, Inns & Cathedrals, Traders & Builders, Count, King & Scout, the Phantom]

It's a fine game, we sure have played plenty.  Hunters and Gatherers may be a bit more elegant, though.

So, the base game + Traders & Builders or Inns & Cathedrals is LONG, too long for what it is.  The base alone has too few city tiles, making luck of the draw too important, even for this.

BUT, for two players, base + King (from King & Scout) gives a light, fun game -- less thinky and deep than Hunters & Gatherers, but more relaxing, perhaps.  Thanks to sister-in-law for leading us to figure that out.

Hrm, update:  K&S is too luckish once you both are playing well (yeah, took me a while).  So, what to do?  Carc is good, but maybe not so good as we thought, once you are used to it.

Interesting tile placing game to build a map of cities, roads, churches and farms.  Have only played the basic game but I think that the core idea of the game is unique.

By placing different tiles, your 'worker' can become 4 different characters in the game: namely farmer, knights, monks or bandits.  With different coniditons met, points are scored and your 'workers' will go back to your pool and ready to be dispatched again.

Good points: Innovative gameplay, balanced between strategising on where to place the tiles and luck to get the tiles you need to score.

Bad points: Can be irritating if you cannot get the tiles you need.  A bit too little 'workers' in the game to be placed on the tiles.

If you're thinking of checking out the "Eurogame" style, this is probably the best place to start in my opinion. The game is one where you lay out tiles on a table which have pictures on them of fields, roads, cities etc and claim those features with your "meeples" (little wooden men, from "my people" - yes I am a geek) you score points depending on the size of each road, city etc and get your man back when it is scored, so you are having to balance high points scoring areas with having less men to place. It is true genius.

I recently purchased the "Big Box 2" edition (2009) that contains: original Carcassonne game, Inns & Cathedrals, Traders & Builders, The Princess & the Dragon, Abbey & Mayor, The River II, and Count, King, and Cult. (The River is not included in this version!) However, grooven does recall that we found the original River to be broken, so maybe it's not great loss that it's not included in this collection. I got this because each expansion is marked with special symbols to make them easy to distinguish for separation after a game. And I'm enamoured by the prospect of separating and storing all the game bits neatly in one box! Based on BGG comments, I don't think that I'd care for Princess & Dragon and The Tower. 

UPDATE 1: Extremely happy about getting the Big Box, since I have fond memories attached to the base game plus Inns and Cathedrals that involve my bf, chilled beer, summer breeze, my parent's dining room table, and our introduction to BGG and board games. 

UPDATE 2: My excuse for getting the Big Box was to introduce it to my parents. We played the base game without the farmers because my dad was impatient with listening to the rules and keeping saying "let's play! let's play! let's get started. let's go!" in that childish way of his... hey wait... grooven... My dad ended up winning with 69 points, my mom with 50, and the two gamers in the house with less than 50 points. Bah! 

2015 UPDATE: I might be regretting getting the Big Box as I haven't played any of the expansions in it. I think I will consider getting an updated version of Carcassonne and scrapping the Big Box as it takes up a big amount of shelf space!

Expansions are likely, since this seems to be one of our go-to's. I'd like it to be a tad longer so one expansion should do.

I know why this gets a lot of love from the gaming community.  I get it.  But I just don't like tile laying games.  The thought of laying tiles down in front of me to build my tableau makes me a little bit sick to my stomach.  I mean, I'll play if people are playing, but I'd rather be playing anything else.  

I do like Isle of Skye, but for the bidding.

Bought this game while waiting out a very slow process of having our third child.  After buying the game, My wife and I wandered around around town, tried to find some spicey food, but finally settled down in a mall food court and played a couple of rounds of Carcassonne.  We didn't end up having the baby that day, but we did have a lovely day.

Carcassonne was a blind buy after Settlers of Catan was becoming the staple game at my house. I wanted something new and refreshing that had the replay value of Settlers. I had not heard about Board Game Geek at the time of this purchase and my confidence in this title came from reading customer reviews of Settlers on Amazon.com and other vendor sites.

Carcassonne has since become my favorite "gateway game". Much like Alhambra, I love this game with four or less. Two is obviously this best, three is good. Four is manageable and anymore than that is purely when I am playing with non-gamers. Carcassonne has won over so many people into acknowledging that boardgames are a great way to pass the time.

Add to that the game has numerous GREAT expansions which make it completely customizable and you have the makings of a top 10 game for me. I love this game.

Easy and fast with some good cut throat tactics.  We play with I&C and T&B rules (except for the goods) and include tiles from most expansions plus some that I have made.  We stack up all the tiles and grab the number of stacks we want to play and usually have 3-4 Games of varying lengths lined up.  If playing head to head with my bother we have been  known to play 8 games in an evening.

Carcassonne is a tile-placement game in which the players draw and place a tile with a piece of southern French landscape on it. The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of his meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Farms are absolutely essential in the base game and it can get annoying how hyper-focused the game gets on farms (which are not even an interesting feature on the map!). The game is basically won or lost via farms most of the time with city heavy strategies only being competitive out of sheer, dumb luck.

Roads and monasteries are purely pick-up points on the side mechanics. You play on roads when you have nothing better to do. You play on monasteries when you're lucky enough to randomly draw one. Monasteries have a mite of strategy to doing well. But road and monastery tiles are MOSTLY relevant depending upon how much they might impact your farms!

Carc is fine, but it feels pretty same-y pretty fast.

Carcassonne was my gateway game, followed quickly by Puerto Rico. It's a good gateway game, because it introduces players to a modular board, and of course has fun little meeples.  And what would BGG be like without meeples!  Playing with more than 3 throws too much chaos into the mix for my taste, and makes the game drag out too long (I know, there's the same number of tiles you're playing through).  Playing with the 3 tiles in hand, play, draw variant is a good way to cut down on the randomness.

My rating should probably be higher on this one, but my group isn't a huge fan of it.  It's a fun, simple game that can be either light and pleasant or mid-weight and cutthroat depending on the table - which is unusual.  Surprisingly deep for how simple the rules are, and plays pretty quick.  It does take a lot of table space, has a gajillion expansions (most of which aren't great), and has a woefully inadequate score track.

I don't own this game as a few of my friends do so I usually get to play it on a fairly regular basis at their houses. I enjoy the game quite a bit but have yet to really delve into the expansions which seem to add an extra degree of complexity to the main game. 

I've played one which I forget now (I think it was the builder) as well as the River expansion and they were quite good. Playing with "The Tower" on the other hand was a miserable experience. Carcassonne with too many expansions is a bloated mess in my opinion. The simpler the better!

My only gripe is that I always seem to pick the wrong tile I need - but I'm sure 99.9% of other people are in the same situation!

Good game!

But don't play with too many players, as you can't plan ahead, so the downtime between turns is a problem.

Players take it in turns to place tiles to create an ever expanding land, players also place meeples to lay claim to castles, roads and fields. Points are gained when a city or road gets completed and at the end of the game when the fields get counted up.

Carcassonne is the modern [gameid=2394]!

Enjoyed playing this a lot when I first got it, but now I wait for someone else to suggest it. Still fun though, with plenty of challenge-- to me, really needs the tiles from I&C and T&B expansions to feel complete, although the additional meeples can be optional according to mood.

Finally got to play this game, simple, fun, and can really test your patience, however, enjoyed and well done.

UPDATE:  After playing this game a few more times I realized, I now do not get the hype.  It is fun, simple and to the point, but is it seriously that good that people would spend hundreds on expansions, I think not.  This is another game like Catan that if you love it, you like simple things, if you hate it, it is because you like heavier games.

The only reason I keep this game in my collection is to play with my younger daughter (5). I have played with my daughters, my husband, my dad, and every time I just don't enjoy it that much. 
Perhaps if i played it more often and developed a deeper strategy it would be fun, but there are so many other games I would rather play in my limited leisure time.
However, playing it with my 5 year old is great and she always seems to enjoy building the cities and roads.

A Carcassonne-tól váltam félig-meddig társasjáték-megszállottá. Végtelenül egyszerű, de mégis fantasztikus mechanizmusa, működése, szabályai miatt kapja tőlem a majdnem maximumot.

:arrowE: [u]Synopsis[/u]:
This game popularized the now-ubiquitous meeple and remains a great time even after I've played lots of heavier fare. Pick up a tile and lay it down, slowing creating lovely bits of the countryside, like roads, cities, farms, and monasteries.  Committing meeples to incomplete projects ties them up until the project is finished, meaning that enterprising enemies can block you in, cutting your chances of completing and abandoning your meeples on the board. Points are awarded for completed projects, and expansions add additional elements like big meeples, shepherds, bonuses for scoring roads and cities, and lots of very cooky (but fun!) stuff.

:arrowE: [u]What I like most[/u]:
There is something just utterly satisfying and cathartic about building the eventual sprawl of the French countryside which I can't find in any other game. Tile laying is enjoyable just for being tile laying, but the simple set of rules built around it, such as committing meeples and attempting to snipe projects started by other players, makes it especially interesting.

This is still my preferred gateway game.

:arrowE: [u]What I like least[/u]:
The obsession to play nasty. This game can be really rough if your intention is to shut down your opponents. I honestly like it the most when it's played more passively. I'm not going to give my opponents the tiles they need at no benefit to myself, but I'm not out to get them.

This is the start of my Eurogame experience and it still stands the test of time.  We've actually combined many expansions together and we play a huge map with just the basic rules.  I find this game scales so well, it works exceedingly well with two players, and still handles five players easily, albeit chaotically.  Excellent first choice as a gateway game for newbies.

RATING: 8
Very good game. Takes only a five minutes to explain the rules and one or two play throughs to adopt the them. With maximum number of six players and with one or two add ons this game still takes only about one and half hour. About 30-45 minutes with two to three players.

The game board is made up placing square tiles one at a time by each player so the game board will always different. I liked the art work very much, it's simple, beautiful and functional. Basic rules are simple and each add on adds an extra set of rules, which will all fit together with the basic game or with any other add on. Although, playing for example with six add ons youd better move the game from table onto the floor to make sure there is enough space and playing with six sets of rules can make a game a bit complicated.

I have to say that I find the "can't join an occupied feature, but it's OK to start a new one with the blatant object of joining them together" rule/mechanic/strategy irritatingly artificial.

Very good game and easy enough to teach to novice players. The base game alone is very good, with a good amount of replayability. Only sticking point in the original game is how powerful a single farmer can become due to the design of the river tiles.

Carcassonne is actually a good game, but I would consider it more of a family game.  At base, it's not overly strategic or exciting.
Gets better with I&C and T&B, which add enough elements to spice things up well.

I like it as an easy-to-teach game, and one I will probably play with (should I ever have them) my children.  However I do not think it is a catch-all-kinds fun game.

Apparently I've never logged a game of this until tonight.  Which was a partial game played at a conference in where they set up some random games during the welcome reception and I thought a couple of guys how to play.  I've certainly played this a few times since I started logging plays, and probably at least a dozen before that - I guess it was never noteworthy enough to remember to log.  Honestly surprised at how high this continues to be rated, because it's SOOOO dry.  I like it anyway, because I like dry games just fine, but surprised that enough other people do, and just outside the top 100 after 17 years is impressive.

Carcassonne is THE tile laying game. It's still one of the best because of its simplicity and strategy. Granted we miss a lot of that strategy because we don't use the farmers when we play. yes. Yes. I hear you. "Then you're not playing it right." Our game, our rules. But even without the farmers it is a good game. A classic and still one of the best.

This is a favourite in our family, though I think we may have overplayed it by now. Too many expansions to keep track of, and almost all of them make the game worse (except for adding some regular pieces which are missing from the original). Visually very pleasing.

Still the best tile placement game as its success is in its simplicity. It's pure tile placement with no background noise to muddle it. Pick a tile place a tile and/or place a meeple on that tile. 

There are far too many expansions. If you add in too many expansions can make it too convoluted and the play time too long and thus take away from what makes Carcassonne great.

A couple of expansions at a time is best.

Carcassone is THE classic tile laying game.
And it still is a lot of fun to play.
Easy to teach and to play and to look to result.
Got a real revival for me when played with the familie in 2014.
Also not too bad as a solitaire puzzle.
The Android version is also good (I don't know if as good as the IOS version, but for me it is ok).
Played it also very often on the PC.
___________________
\_______GER_______/
Habe Carcassonne früher auch häufig als PC-Spiel gespielt. Und jetzt ab und zu als Androidversion zum Solospielen.
Mit echten Mitspielern ist es doch immer noch interessanter.
Nach Ankauf der [thing=5405] 2ten Erweiterung Händler und Baumeister[/thing] sind die Karten in den blauen Stoffbeutel gekommen. Ich finde das Ziehen aus dem Beutel am praktischsten. Umgedreht auf dem Tisch braucht man sehr viel Platz, den man eigentlich zum Auslegen benötigt. Den Turm aus der 4ten Erweiterung [thing=21385]Der Turm[/thing] finde ich dagegen nicht wirklich praktisch (der Turm als Kartenhalter sieht halt nur interessant aus). 
Am meisten Spaß macht mir das Spiel zu zweit (maximal zu viert) Mit mehr als 4 Spielern wird es schon sehr unplanbar und man muss auch zu lange warten bis man selber wieder dran ist. 
Eine interessante Hausregel ist das Ziehen von insgesamt 3 Handkarten pro Zug. Dadurch kann man im Prinzip etwas besser planen und ist somit nicht ganz vom Ziehglück abhängig.

Die folgenden Erweiterungen habe ich standard in das Grundspiel integriert: 
[thing=2591]Der Fluss[/thing] diese kleine Mini-Erweiterung gab es als Beigabe zum PC-Spiel. Die Flusskarten sehen schön aus, ändern das Grundspiel aber nicht dramatisch. Da diese Karten eine andere Rückseite haben sind sie leicht heraus zu sortieren.

Die [thing=2993]1te Erweiterung Wirtshäuser und Kathedralen[/thing] (7.5) bringt keine dramatischen neuen Regeln, hauptsächlich mehr Karten. Die Wirtshäuser sind ganz nett als Zusatzpunkte bei geringem Risiko. Die beiden Kathedralen können zwar eine Menge Extrapunkte geben haben aber auch ein grössere Risiko wenn man die Stadt nicht abschließen kann (dann gibt es gar kein Punkte).  Der große Meeple pro Spieler ist ein zusätzliches taktisches Element das gut ist.

Die [thing=5405] 2te Erweiterung Händler und Baumeister[/thing] (7.5) wird in vielen Reviews als die beste bzw. sinnvollste Erweiterung für das Grundspiel beschrieben. Der große Stoffbeutel ist eine nette und sinnvolle Beigabe, es passen alle Karten vom Grundspiel und alle von mir verwendeten meine standard Erweiterungen rein.

I think it's really enjoyable, but playing it on iOS lets the computer do the math...which means, I'm not as on top of the actual scoring mechanics. I'd LOVE to play this on a real table with real tiles, but my husband is not interested in doing the math live.

There's a reason this game is considered a "Euro classic". Simple rules, quick to play, a little luck on the tile draw, but a good helping of strategy as well.

And it's relatively easy to bring to the table. Many people like to play it.

My very first gateway game. I love it and always will, but I would never consider playing it without at least one or two expansions. My favourite expansions are Traders & Builders and Inns & Cathedrals along with Rivers I & II. This is the whole perfect lot of Carcassonne for a fun and disputed game between or among experienced or newbie players (it plays well with two or more players, but it changes quite a bit, ... with a higher number of players it gets more strategical because each player has fewer tiles to deploy thus less chances to score).

Carcassonne quickly became my go-to game almost immediately after I bought it.  I play with lots of people who are unfamiliar with the gaming hobby, and this is the perfect introductory game.  The rules are very simple to explain and there is almost no set up.  You can literally be playing this game five minutes after a "non-gamer" sees the box and tries to pronounce "Carcassonne".  Despite it's simplicity, there is plenty of strategy to keep the game interesting.  

My initial rating after a few plays was a 6.5, but I have bumped it up substantially the more I have played it.

My wife and I play this a lot. It doesn't take long to go from beginner to beating the most experienced player at the table. It's really cool to see the board come together as you play and the finished result usually ends up pretty interesting and sometimes comical. I also play this game solo from time to time, more for practice than anything else, it's kind of a free form puzzle.

  The game hands you a tile and you have to figure out what to do with it.  I found myself wanting very specific tiles, but never getting them.  Doesn't feel like it has much potential for strategy, because the tiles you draw might not line up with your current goals.

This game is a much, much better 2 player game than 3-5 player game. 3-5 player games are almost entirely decided by luck. 2 player games are much less luck--skill is rewarded at a much higher rate, and strategy is very important. I'd give this game an 8.5 as a two player game, a 6.5 as a three player game, a 5 as a 4 player game, and 3 as a five player game.

Rating based on one game. Looks to be a game with some depth and placement strategy. Probably more interactive than most of this type as you can foil the other players strategy.

Picked up a cheap copy in Melb 11/09.

Purchased a travel edition in Barcelona to play with the folks while in Provence...they seem to be enjoying it so far.

Gifted Xmas 2012 to the Father in Law, along with a new Inns & Cathedrals expansion...he loves it and plays it constantly.

Good family, gateway game.  Another nice thing about it is that it scales very well.  Can be explained in 10 minutes.  When I've played with kids 8 and older they've enjoyed the game and grasped the concepts.  The real key seems to be in learn how to optimize farmer placement.

Relies too heavily on luck for my taste and teaching new players is quite a bother, esp with expansions. Playing with a hand of 3 tiles per player makes it more strategical and less luck based, I prefer that. It makes it possible to plan up to 3 turns ahead and really gives the game some much needed depth.

Decent diversion, but strategic choices seem severely hindered by the "Draw one tile, use it NOW" gameplay.  Variants that allow for two-tile hands could remedy this.  It's by no means a bad game, and it's cheap, but it doesn't get much play around here.

Great game, fun to play while still accessible to non-gamers. The only drawback is the limited tile selection in the base set, particularly the lack of city-field-single road combinations. The "Wheel of Fortune" edition has better tile variety, but seems only available in the '14 Big Box.

Amazing game.  My wife and I have played it together more times than I can count.  Any game that your wife requests to play is amazing in my book.  I think it plays best with 2-3 and is very cutthroat with the smaller group size.  I would have rated this higher except it really needs Inn & Cathedrals and Traders & Builders (mostly Builder from this expansion) to really shine.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Got this as a less-cutthroat game for Co and I to play together. Pretty fun - strategy seems pretty deep. Want to try it with more than two people, but it seems to play pretty well with 2. 

Will probably be picking up the expansions eventually.

The beauty in this game lies in it's simplicity. There are only a few basic rules you need to know, and yet the expanding map has an aesthetic appeal that makes the game pleasing to play.

I'm wondering why this hasn't hit the table at our gaming days with the group yet. I'm thinking that it will be a great way to let people cool down in between games of BSG and other cuththroat games (thereby making the wives more likely to want to play.)

Fantastic game. Simple enough to play when having a tipple (or three... why is the rum always gone?!) We've played this more than any other game over the last year or so. Randomly drawing tiles and building up a map before deciding to commit your limited scoring pieces. Lots of room for sneaky placement of your meeples (scoring pieces) to surprise your opposition as the game and board develops.

RATING: 8
I have friends who would give this a 9 - always want to play it. I tend to favor variety. Lots of people seem to enjoy just playing with the meeples and tiles. Strongly weighted toward tactical decisions and no hidden information, so it works well with a young or new player as everyone can help them. That also means one person can play four or five colors solitaire and not give up the feel of the multi-player game.

Feels like rummy/go-fish by standard rules.  Try holding a hand of three face-up tiles to choose from (after the initial river) with drawing of each new tile at the end of your turn.  To be fair, a builder bonus tile is drawn and played immediately (not from your hand).

I've only played this on BSW. Too dependant on luck, and it suffers from some people's approach to it (too ofensive people can be unnerving; and with too pasive people it feels like some kind of multiplayer jigsaw puzzle).

RATING: 7.2
This game is very simple. Draw a tile, place one of your pieces (a follower) on that tile, then score for points. That's just it.

+ very simple, few rules
+ has expansions
+ not a lot of downtime
+ 2 to 6 players (and really works with 2)
+ looks good on the table

- very luck based (you don't have any control over what you draw)
- when you draw a bad tile you can't do anything
- no reward for finishing someone else's road or castle.
- not much player interaction. 

thankfully some (-) were corrected with some of the expansions.

Elismerem, hogy szép és precízen megalkotott játék, amit bemelegítő játéknak el tudok képzelni. Ha jól tudom, ez egy műfajteremtő darab, ez volt az első ilyenfajta lapka-lepakolgatós játék, ezt is díjazom. Ennek ellenére nem tartom egy nagy durranásnak, és nem tudom elképzelni, hogy ezzel mondjuk évi 1-nél többször játsszak. Amikor kaptam (2005), még elég kevés játékot ismertem ahhoz, hogy tetsszen a Carcassone, ma viszont már olyan sok jobb játékot ismerek, hogy ez számomra elveszik a szürke középmezőnyben. Viszont van két kiegészítőm is, amiket még nem próbáltam, azokra kíváncsi vagyok!
---
Kipróbáltam a kiegekkel is, így jobb!
---
Kipróbáltam egyszerre 8 kieggel. Tetszett, hogy a sok szabály révén kicsit összetettebb volt, mint az alapjáték, de azért a hossza miatt kicsit sok volt ez így nekem. Lehet, hogy egy életre kipipáltam ezzel a Carcassone-t, elég volt belőle:)

Combined base game, Big Box and expansion to make huge game.

+ Great gateway game. A good way to introduce new gamers, and slowly up the depth and difficulty with expansions.
+ Fun with 2
+ Expansions offer a lot of variability and difficulty settings

o The farmers, although seemingly simple, offer a lot of depth. (even more when adding Barns) Which is great for experienced players (I'd rather not play without) but might be difficult for beginners, or those who have trouble 'seeing' how they can expand their farmland.

- We hardly play this anymore, because with the amount of tiles we have, it takes hours to complete. We'd rather spend our time on a heavy euro. Whenever we want to have a quick 1:1 Carcassonne experience, we turn to Carcassone: Star Wars, which add a bit of direct conflict.

Haven't played a serious game with only adults. But the kids liked it. Took a little too long for the younger ones though.

update: Juzzo and I love this 2 player.
4 player was more awkward, but still fun if everyone knew what they were doing.

It's fun to see the map develop - only playing with children and family means I haven't experienced this as the competitive game that others talk about - would be interested to try it out that way - nice moment when my 5 year old made a good play with a farmer! Proud Dad! Improved by Inns & Cathedrals and the Builders expansions.
EDIT: playing this on ios, especially with both the first two expansions, really shows how the game can be played competitively! My appreciation of it as a game has increased significantly.

THE GATEWAY GAME.  A true classic, ideal for beginners.  It looks nice, it is fun, not too complex (actually easy, and can be made even easier if we get rid of the farms)...  Together with Ticket to Ride, I think it is the perfect introductory game for newbies.
And a good one even if you are an experienced gamer.

Initial Impression: I'm not sure why I don't like this game. It's rules are very simple. I guess I just don't feel as if there are too many choices in your turn. The scoring system didn't thrill me either. I think the most attractive part of the game is when its over and you can look at the wonderful city you've all created.

RATING: 9
It becomes a classic : we play it always with two cards instead of one. To me it is still the one and only best version of carcassonne : the farmers are the best idea of the game, mostly they decide the game : frustrating good. remarkable : In the French City of Carcassonne I didn't find one copy of the game (summer 2001)!

I've tried this as a gateway game to mixed reviews. Perhaps I should leave out farming when we play as a gateway.

It feels boring and bland compared to newer tile laying games. The theme provides typical euro-style blandness. However, unlike other blandly themed euro-games, the decisions during a game of (base) Carcassonne are not very interesting and, in fact, feel arbitrary. Even as far as a "gateway" game goes, this game feels, at best, lackluster.

I've played Carcassonne a few times and while I haven't won at all, I just watched the TableTop episode and I do like how some late game planning and early game scoring make up this game. Edit: A big part of winning is knowing the game pieces and knowing how many of which kind are left. Once you know that there are no more city tiles left, then you play differently than if you didn't know. This makes those with experience with the game have a significant edge.

Carcassonne is one of my all time favorite games, but only with the right combination of expansions. The base game severely lacks options, so base Carcasonne gets a 7 from me. However, add "Traders & Builders", the big meeple from "Inns & Cathedrals" and "The Phantom", and the game gets a solid nine. Carcassonne is the go-to game for me and my girlfriend. We play it almost every week.

Edit: Sees less play with the steady expansion of our collection, but I will always have a soft spot for this game.

So much luck involved.  In an effort to reduce the randomness we started drawing two tiles and playing one.  I think that's the wrong way to go though.  Instead, just realize you have to play within the limitation (i.e., randomness) of the draw.  Easy to explain, not too long.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
An excellent game that just misses being considered a superb gateway game for me. Carcassone doesn't quite have the same caliber in game play as many of the typical gateway games. Overall, it tends to do better in raking in non-gamers, but it's not deep or complicated enough to push them over the edge into "real" gaming. The game is always fun to play, and the torrent of expansions do nothing but improve the game. I agree with most that there are way too many Carcassone expansions coming out way too frequently, but this can easily be eliminated by Not Buying All Of Them. Probably my favorite aspect of this game is that it is very playable with any age, from adult to teens, younger children down to two-year-olds. Fantastic.

Fun, versatile game... but only if 2-3 experienced players are mixing it up with various features from multiple expansions.  I wouldn't suggest this as an entry-level game for it plays best with gamers familiar with the tiles & expansion features.  However, it really isn't a gamer's game, so I play it infrequently.

Although you can get by with just the base game, Inns & Cathedrals, and Traders & Builders, the game just wouldn't be as much fun without using one of the later expansions for the sake of variety.  However, some features from the later expansions are very annoying and/or non-essential.

Top game that is easy accessible and a great intro-game, even for players that don't game too much (like my parents who otherwise only play a few card games).

It plays very well with only 2-players, but changes a lot. As a 2-player game it turns into a direct confrontation, zero-sum game which might turn some people off.
However, with more players this direct confrontation is gone and replaced with much more friendly co-building of cities and roads.

Since we own [thing=2993]Inns & Cathedrals[/thing] we always play with the expansion (although for new players we just use the tiles and ignore the additional rules)

LIKES - Great accessibility to new gamers.  

DISLIKES - Low depth of strategy.  Who ever claims the biggest farms seems to win almost all the time.  Not a challenging game.  Game play decisions are boring.

WHY A 3.5 RATING BASED ON BGG RATING DEFINITIONS? - Most likely I will not be "talked into" playing this game (4).  However it is not a "bad" game (3).

The first Eurogame to which I was introduced.  Loved it and played it to death.  Had to get the expansions and was gifted with Hunters and Gatherers due to my exuberance for the game.  This led me to explore other Eurogames and the latest American offerings, as well as my getting reacquainted with my old Avalon Hill games, starting a board game collection (many of which come from thrift stores or holiday gifts), and finding my way to boardgamegeek.com.  Is it my favorite game?  No.  But it was the beginning of expanding a hobby that had always been enjoyed.  A landmark game in my gaming history.  [Market price]

RATING: N/A
When you find something like this at a thrift store, you just can't pass it up.  This is the 2001 edition with the river expansion.  All meeples are accounted for.  Unfortunately, one each of the following tiles are missing: D (straight road with end cap wall), J (90 degree road with end cap wall) and M (triangular city piece with pennant).  You can obviously play without those three pieces, but you may want this for extra tiles to augment your own game, or even the 40 meeples that come with it.  If no one is interested, that's fine...I'll just augment my own collection with more tiles. :-)  Game box is in fine condition.  Traded away at GameStorm14.

I also have the Winter version and the Castle version.  I find Carcassonne to be a lot of fun.  There are always interesting decisions and building the map/board with the placement of tiles is very satisfying.  Mechanic wise I like the place a tile/ place a meeple and the whole meeple management although there is not as much "meat" to this as some of my all time favorites I like the accessibility and the fun factor.

Not bad at all: Carcassonne is a good idea and has a nice design. It can be played by just two players, though matches can easily go on with a maximum of five-six people. However, the more you play, the more the actions become repetitive, making the game lose in dynamicity. The cards system gives a significant weight to fate, but, in my opinion, in Carcassone you can often overcome bad luck in short time, despite the strategic side isn't too deep.

It is a classic and absolutely worth the time to play if you haven't. The game dynamic changes based on the experience of the players. It can go from a nice and gentle game of silently cooperative building to an all out passive aggressive war, where tiles are played to deny and to take over.

Carcassone is pretty solid.  I'm curious to see how it plays with the T + B expansion.

The game seems more fun when the players are more confrontational, as long as it doesn't get overly nasty.  Otherwise, it boils down to whoever can optimize their luck better, which is still sort of interesting, but not quite as exciting or fun.

[b]Spiel des Jahres 2001[/b]
[b]Deutscher Spiele Preis 2001[/b]

[i]Posted: 10/2/04, Rated: 8[/i]

[i]Carcassonne[/i] is a fun game, with easy mechanics.  My five year-old (at the time of this writing) is able to play effectively.  I do have a couple of small complaints, though. The first has to do with tile memorization: when it is my turn, how I place a certain tile should be affected by my knowledge of the remaining pieces.  I feel that my understanding of the game is limited by not memorizing all of the different tile configurations with respect to roads, cities, fields, etc.  

The other complaint that I have is how overwhelmingly strong a well-placed farmer can be. In some games, I have found myself eschewing the completion of cities or monasteries, just so I could extend the reach of a single farmer. The farming score at the end of these games was obscenely large, and resulted in what appeared to be a huge come from behind win.

[i]Carcassonne[/i] can be taught to new players very quickly, and is a good introduction for those who have never played a European game before.

[i]Updated: 8/29/10, Rated: 7[/i]

[i]Carcassonne[/i] is still a good game, but it's not a "go to" title for which I would go out of my way to find a game.  Perhaps with the right blend of expansions it can still be an "8," but not on its own.

Carcassonne is our go-to two player game. My wife and I have thoroughly enjoyed several rounds and have started exploring some of the expansions.

This game is really unlike anything else in my collection currently. It is equally good with two as it is with four. It is very rewarding to see what you and your competitors have built at the end. The first two expansions (Inns & Cathedrals, Traders & Builders) add a lot and are probably all you'll ever need. After you get comfortable playing the game, you soon learn that there are deeper levels of play. You can be much more cutthroat in the placement of your meeples. Especially when planning on taking control of castles, etc. that your opponents are working on.

[i][Rating for Carcassonne with River and Inns and Cathedrals expansions][/i]

Easy to learn, charming components, and elegant simplicity all in a casual (or more cut-throat, if you so desire) game for two to six (though I prefer to play with four players or fewer). The game can sometimes come down to a few critical tile draws, so chance can play a reasonably large role. Despite this, player decisions certainly contribute much more to final scores than chance, and the game [i]is[/i] intended to be a fairly lightweight family game, so I think the level of chance is appropriate. The River is a nice expansion, but Inns and Cathedrals is absolutely critical for the large follower and inns. Once I&C has been added, Carcassonne is a very nice game indeed.

Recommended 'variant': Each player has a 'hand' of one tile. The turn order is (i) Play tile; (ii) Draw new tile. This way players get to think about what their next placement is during other players' turns, reducing downtime during the active player's turn and giving each player something to think about while waiting.

Great game to play with gamers and non-gamers alike as it is quick and easy to learn. There is more to this little tile laying game than meets the eye.

One of my highest rated games on BGG. There's nothing to improve on here. Is simply a fantastic game and near perfection in design.

But for that reason, gets more play than most games in my collection. Never fails to put a smile on our faces.

I got this game after Settlers and Ticket to Ride.  I find that as I have moved onto other games of the three big gateway games this is the one that I like to continue playing most.

I have also been able to introduce many other people to gaming through this game as well!

RATING: 8
Nice relaxing game. I actually prefer it as a 2 player over anything else - a 2 player game allows some strategy to be worked in - it is more difficult to work any kind of strategy in higher player counts since your probability of drawing the tiles you need is drastically reduced. I prefer to play with Builders & Traders, Inns & Cathedrals, the abbot and the farmer. The other expansions add too much randomness for me.

I used to play this solitaire quite a bit in college, and I love the whimsical tile art. It (the whole Carcassonne family, indeed) is a great game to play with casual gamers.

The expansions are very, very good.  Even if you use them all together.  Maybe especially if you use them all together.  Using the River II as a starter is pretty much a necessity when you combine a lot of expansions together.
  
I keep the original game around as it is a very, very light connection-style game with an innovative scoring technique---and with wonderfully whimsical art.  Non-gamers tend to like the Carcasonne series a lot, and this was one of my first Eurogames to love.

One of those games people always seem to mention when people look to step beyond the Milton Bradley games into something more engaging. Lay tiles, building a countryside and place meeples for various scoring along the way.

Mixed feelings on this one. It is a light and pretty game, but there is not much control to it and the choices are hardly tense or deep. Not a great favourite when playing with adults, hence my pretty low rating. I would, however, give this a nine as a family title. My kids (five and seven) love it and can compete on equal terms, both with each other and with their parents. The fact that it is part of the game to have discussions about the tile placement helps a lot in this regard while the scoring is of just the right complexity to introduce the feel for Germanic titles. Also, the potential for high scoring farmers at the end of the game and the potential for some nice bits of screwage (a plus in our family!) adds a level of strategy that they can grow into as they become more familiar with it.

I came into this game thinking Very Clever Pipe Game, but was decieved. The scoring is still a puzzle I'm working out: farmers permanantly tie up a meeple, but seem to be vital in wracking up the points. This is a great game when you don't have time for a longer one (such as Settlers or Puerto Rico), but it's much more than a filler for between games. I am always willing to play this game.

I love the whole concept of the game of Carcassonne. No expansions are needed to enjoy the game, but it amazes me how much a few new tiles can change the game. I like the box size, making it easy to transport. I never mind losing in this game... the joy is in playing it and sharing it with others. It's very easy to teach to new gamers.

At my point of view, the original game rules are boring, with no excitement. 

I am using home rules: the player who has bigger castle become a feudal and all other players add their farmers scores to feudal`s total at the end of the game. Also,the feudal may take seize of the other player(s) castle (by placing number of maples that = to number of castle tiles + number of "foreign" maples on them)  if he controls the road (maple on it) to that castle.

I like that you can make the board different every time you play and the limitation of only being able to play one of your pieces on the part of the game-board you laid down... only down-side to this game is that the farmer scoring is a bit confusing for newer players.

The first modern Euro game that got me into boardgaming hobby. Played this too much in the beginning and now I don't want to play this again. This has the status of best gateway game and is easy to teach and grasp, but is by no means the best board game. I'm especially annoyed by the farmers and their endgame scoring.

Owned by friends.

We like to play this game with a hand of three tiles instead of being forced to place the tile you just drew. This will let you make plans several turns in advance and let you think about your next move while the other players are making their move. This makes for more fun and speeds up game play.

The best part (besides infinite replayabilty) of Carcassonne is how easy it is to explain to newbies.  One of the Big 4 "gateway" games to Eurogaming.

This game is so good.

It is true that it might be a gateway game, but I feel that despite its simplicity it really caters to hardcore gamers as well (well, or at least it appeals to me).

And even though it is luck dependent, I always seem to be able to do almost whatever I want (I might have been lucky up until now).
On the plus side, I like how it can be both a rather peaceful game and a cutthroat experience.

Some expansions add a lot of depth to the game.

This game has saved me so much money.  Its high ratings and popularity remind me that high ratings and popularity don't mean that I will like the game.  It is far too luck-based, and any themes it has don't really transfer to the heart.  So I don't like playing it.  Makes a pretty board when it's over, but I can do that on my own.

I like this game.  Something I can play from the 8 year old to the wife with.  They all get the strategy and all of them play well!  I only give it an 6 because I like more complexity and strategy with a little less luck of the draw.  Still, I would never turn down a play of it. Sure there is luck, but the strategy of WHERE to place that single tile and WHO to place on it is very deep.  Very good game.

I often take it easier and play a lighter game with Rikki, and then get cutthroat with players who can handle it.

The first game I bought for myself as an adult. Can be played aggressively or passively. The puzzle of where to put your piece is nice. When you look down at the board at the end, it looks like you've really built something.

I've only played this twice and each time was quite a bit apart - when playing the game the first time, it's hard to grasp the importance of farmers and the fact that it can be quite easy to get your Meeples back.  Don't be afraid of deploying them as farmers if you can score a couple cities, I think.

A lot of your moves are also quite obvious, which makes for simplistic turns.  You know where you're going to put that tile, so now you're just waiting for your turn.

I admire the concept, flexibility, and new-player-friendliness of this game a lot. Two or three player games go on just long enough for me, while four players can push it into a bit of a drag. 

I'm not a huge fan, but it definitely deserves a place in the collection.

--- after more plays ---
I'm actually liking this more, now. Even with 5 people, it's proving to be enjoyable. There are deals going on, threats, and groans as people play the tile you were hoping to get. 

We always play with the I&C expansion, and "hand of two tiles" variant. (Not sure I'd like to play so much otherwise....)

I find this to be luck based. Others disagree, but then I usually play it 2 player and that might be what is wrong. If anyone can suggest an expansion to improve the game, I would gladly give it another go. Still very enjoyable.

When I started getting into modern board gaming, I fell hard for Carc and bought up a bunch of expansions. It's got a very special place in my heart, and really fostered my obsession with BGG as well. I still love it, but I don't get it to the table much these days. I like it best as a 2 player game. With the right players it gets deliciously vicious and cutthroat. But it's also perfect for lighter, more pleasant and carefree gaming. It's solidly tactical and lightly strategic. Sometimes feels a little too luck dependent, but usually there are enough useful choices on a tile that luck can be mitigated. I always play with Inns and Cathedrals, and then I like to mix in an additional 1-3 expansions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Most of the games I play now are have twice the game weight of Carcassonne, but I still love to play this game, there is something elegant about the design, this is just a fun mechanic to play.

I own the following expansions

:Bridges, Castles, and Bazaars :Inns & Cathedrals
:King & Scout:Little Buildings :The Count of Carcassonne :The Flier :The Ferries :The Festival:The Messenges :The Mini Expansion:The Phantom :The Plague :The Princess & the Dragon :The River :The River II :The Tower :Traders & Builders

"Played it with a variant. We take random tiles and arrange them to a neat little town and place some meeples on it. then we flick other meeples at it. a bit like rampage, but much better!"

Nice game that seems to appeal to non-gamers. WARNING: severe score crunching at the end. My biggest objection to this game is that it is often advantageous to count the score and plan your move for several minutes at the last few rounds of the game. This will annoy the other players a lot, but is worth it. So the game slows down tremendously at the end making it a big annoying. The expansions are not needed, they make the scoring even more complex, without much additional fun.

UPDATE: The Ipad app is great. The board game is good, but it's better on the Ipad. One of the best Ipad apps for sure.

A hit with non-gamers and the trillion expansions out there make it worthwhile. 

Aug.2008
I haven't played for a year and then when I played again I decided I got bored with it.
However, I think this is because this last year I played far more complex games than Carc so when I played again it seemed soooo light...

From 8 down to 5...

23, July 2010
I recently played with 4 completely non players at the age 60+. They had a hard time getting into it. I didn't use the farmer rule. We played UNO for the remainder of the night :)

This is a fun and pretty-to-look-at game.  But my rating has gone down (from an 8.5), because, well, it got old--we don't pull it out anymore.  Might be time for an expansion set.

This is my all time favorite and also the game that got me back into board gaming, after nearly a decade of playing video games. I bought it in January 2004 and liked it so much that I purchased The Expansion soon after. Next expansion I believe was Traiders and Builders. Both of those made this already very good game, even better. I have continued adding expansions to the set and I currently hold around 20 expansions. I usually play with all the tiles, but not all features are used. Actually, I have never played it with all features of every expansion in the same game , mostly due to lack of interested game buddies.

Carcassonne was very influential to gaming as a whole, and is still pretty fun even in its vanilla form. That being said, I shy away from it unless it's a variant or retheme, none of which I have added to my collection so far.

Simple and intuitive, Carcassonne even happens to have a somewhat deeper layer of strategy that makes it enjoyable by everyone: depending on the players’ skills and commitment, it works as a gateway game, as a family/strategy game and even as a more challenging game for the hardcore players.

Too bad not all of its expansions keep up with the original game: they rather make it duller. [i](September 2011)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - Carcassonne is undoubtedly good, as long as it’s played once in a while. Thus, since one of the goals I set for my Fall 2015 rating revise was to keep half-point ratings to a minimum and Carcassone isn’t one of those by far, I rounded down my rating from 7,5 to 7.

Carcassonne never gets old. Great components and straight forward rules that make it easy to learn and play. Accessible to new gamers and engaging enough for more seasoned players looking for something lighter but not too light.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.75
I like games where the board is never the same and this is one of Carcassonne's biggest perks.  You create the board as you play.  I tend to like it a bit more than Catan simply because there is less luck involved (anyone who tells you Carcassonne involves mostly luck simply doesn't know how to play it well - make good plays and it's rare you'll draw a tile that is not useful to you in some manner).

In a nutshell you are building a landscape with Roads, Cities, Fields, Abbeys, etc.  You 'claim' one of those things (if someone has not already) with a game piece (a 'meeple') of which you have seven.  Once someone has claimed the start of one of the individual structures building on to it and completing it will provide you points.  When you complete one you get the 'meeple' back that was on it in order to play it on a new construction.

The base game is very simple and easy to learn, but mastering it will make you really pay attention to the board.  There are many expansions to this game, so I would suggest buying the base game and the "River II" to start with, then read up on the expansions and add in the ones that look appealing to you.  I've added a couple expansions, but I find trying to use them all gets to be too much.

Revisit (1/26/06):  It's just hard to get excited about this game when it comes out.  Can't plan too much, just have to get that tile.  It's best with only two in my opinion.

Revist (8/3/10): As a 2 player game, it's very good and it's available in so many mediums, I can always get a game in.

Too bad they messed around with the farmer scoring rules and then didn't update the English rules.  I try to use the newish rules with 3pts per farmed city in each field, but still use the simple city scoring (only 2pts for a 2 tile city).

Here's my favorite way to play: Play will all the vanilla tiles (so, no springs, lakes, cathedrals, dragons, etc.) and then add in all the different meeples. So, big meeple, builder, pig, wagon, barn and mayor. All the rules can be described at the beginning, and no overwhelming or overpowered tile abilities. No extra bits, and no way to knock out any already placed meeples, other than simple majorities. Its all about positioning, like Carc should be.

Enjoy the game.  My wife always wants to play with the river, and with just two players it threatens to become "you play your side and I play mine".  She complains a little when I put a farmer on her side, heh.  But with more players, there is no such nice play.

Carcassonne: The Discovery is a better introduction to the series.  This one has a few rough edges and is not as good with multiple players... but the rough edges make it a bit more interesting.

I absolutely love Carcassone, played it with my kids and they're big fans too.  I think we must have played it about 5 times a week for the first month we owned it!  Basically you have to build roads, castles and fields.  The fields you only count at the end and my wife always goes for these and often wins the game from having not many points earlier.

RATING: 7
Rightfully deserves its status as a classic even if I chafe under the threat of drawing road tiles umpteen times in a row.  Play a tile, play a meeple?, pass the bag.  Efficient, fun and a nice French landscape emerges from game play.  Stealing someone's high value city out from under them is a very satisfying experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Love the simplicity of the game and the union of game speed with tactics.  Can't fault a fun game that you can knock out in 20 minutes with as many players as you have at hand.  Great game to fill the gap between games or once players get eliminated.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Only the tile just drawn can have a worker placed on it. Not only does it matter where on the tile the worker is placed, but more importantly where the tile itself is placed on the "board". Different tiles give different options in both regards.

Typically, as the game progresses each tile affords fewer possibilities which means you rely on luck of the draw to a growing extent.

By itself, the original Carcassonne is not as good as some of the other games in the series (Hunters and Gatherers, New World, The Castle), but when you consider the expansions, it is clearly the king.

The ultimate girlfriend game. She just loves doing her own thing on the board and have a good time. If you don't play it too much cut-throat, then you'll have a good time together. We altered the rules to make certain options like the monasteries and roads more tempting to build. Finished monasteries are now multiplied with 3, standard roads with 2 (with a lake on it x3) and we're looking to alter the farmer rule. Endless re-playable.

The biggest reason I like this game is that my wife likes this game. It's simple and fun, with biggest strategic decisions tending to be the farmers. Probably won't get most of the expansions, but thinking about Inns and Cathedrals.

I love Carcassonne. This game is everything from a lighthearted, relaxing, puzzle built with other friends that ends with the last tile being placed to a cut-throat tile-laying game filled with tension, ruining your opponents plans, and hearing the cries from small children witnessing this carnage. It's incredible the versatility that different players will create with this game. And it plays in about an hour, what's not to love?

// Certainly a classic, and easy enough that my non-gaming
mom was able to pick it up quickly. (I think it's important
to have that type of game in a collection.) As far as tile-
laying games are concerned, Isle of Skye really replaced
this for me. They aren't ultra-similar games otherwise, but
if I look at this one on the shelf, I typically would
rather play that one instead now.

Nice & light. Can start a game night up with it, no need for build up. My oldest daughter (7yrs old) is able to play it, not grasp the overall and end game point strategy, but plays pretty well. She always wants to put a her man in to make her palace. 

Owned it for over 2 years, and it's a Great game. Playing this game is like sitting down in the morning with that cup of coffee and watching the sun come up. There's just something warm and inviting about playing this game. I don't know what it is that makes it feel that way, but it does that for me.

Carcassonne was my 'gateway' into the world of proper board games.

I guess for the same reason that not many people know about "that little Italian place outside of town that serves the most unbelievably authentic pizza", and instead frequent the more obvious and dominant restaurants, such as Dominoes, Pizza Hut, or Pizza Express*, one can never really know the true depth of scope when it comes to board games, if all you know is Toys'R'Us.

* don't get me wrong, I will happily trample over my own grandmother for a Pizza Express.

I had not scratched the surface of this world, but I was eager to claw my way into its depths. In purchasing Carcassonne, I had effectively discovered the Italian place, and tentatively ordered a margarita.

This game is great for kids (I have a 12 year old who can verify this), but just as good for a wine-fueled evening for two. Games are quick enough to not feel too hard done by if you lose, because before you know it, you're playing the next one.

As with all games, play this one enough and you'll eventually get that "played to death" feeling, but don't let that put you off. Carcassonne is a great game and I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone... especially if they're not really gamers.

A clever idea for a game, but not entirely successful in my book.  Not enough interesting decisions for the strategists, and too much sitting and watching people compare their tile to every edge of the board for a light game.  I prefer the variant giving players a three tile hand.

RATING: 8
One of my favourite euros. Very adaptable to different numbers of players which changes play dynamic without breaking the game. Only one expansion necessary - Inns and Cathedrals (and that is mainly for the extra set of meeples for a 6th player).
Also a favorite game to introduce to very young children, 7-, as you can gradually introduce the different scoring rules (cities first, then roads, ... and finally, if ever, farmers) to build up the complexity of the game.
Do not be afraid to play with less than the full compliment of tiles as more tiles => longer game. This is especially true when you start adding more + more expansions. Better to just play the base game with 1 more expansion.

Good for beginners & non-gamers, but it's simplistic (except for the farmer scoring which can be a nightmare).  I say simplistic because you have a single tile to work with.  You play that tile, then draw another single tile (and hope it's a good one) and wait for your next turn.  I'd prefer to have several tiles to choose from for more strategic play.

Carcassonne is one of those games, isn't it? Games, you've played very much, and enjoy, but as time goes by, and you keep finding new games, your love for this game just doesn't seem to fade. 

The goal we have at home, is to actually try to play it with evey single expansion we own, at one time. We're planmning to have a carc-day, in which we play basic game first, then add one expansion a game.

Enjoyable, good game to re-introduce people into playing board games. We played it out after we first bought it, but recently it's seen more play, and my rating has gone back up from a 6 to a 7. It seems to have recovered slightly from the "burnout" factor, for now.

RATING: 7
I suspect many people consider this the archetypal tiles game. Players draw, blindly, a tile from a bag, and lay it next to a previously played tile.

The goal is to connect tiles in such a way that they form cities, roads, cloisters, and fields, scoring points if that player controls the completed area.

It's a really good game. It seems completely luck dependent, but there are very few tiles that are as useless as they first seem.

I recommend this to most gamers, even those who think they detest luck-based games.

Carcassonne deserves praise for what it was in 2000, before it created a whole family of games which further developed the design. Currently, as stated on the box, it's a "clever game of tile laying." It's rules still are surprisingly simple and the strategic thought that can be produced from those rules make it a great game to have in the collection, occupying an important niche. I can get it to the table with my wife or a non-gamer and even have the television on while playing. All of this said, there really isn't any theme at all; it's a very well designed competitive puzzle. This keeps me from loving a game which I at most can only like and respect.

RATING: 7
Really enjoy this game, though not a top favorite. It can take a while to play through, and sometimes you can get incredibly unlucky with the tiles you draw and when. A great deal of the strategy is based around the long term, where things just might not play out as you'd hoped, leaving you with little recourse. Too slow to play for me, with too little to do, can trigger AP pretty badly for how simple it is, and frankly takes up a LOT of table space and gets very annoying to shift around if you start building on a constricted side. Would prefer to play something else with the same time investment.

After playing this game for the first time I was stuck. Easy to learn, and love. Yes, now I am a carcaholic: I own every expansion and every version, and many unofficial ones as well.

But this was the introduction to the Carcassonne-world so it deserves a 10.

One of my all time favorite games.  I like the simple rules and dynamic play.  I love how very expandable it has proven to be, and how those expansion make the game very modular, and thus the game play highly variable.

Optimal play is probably two players, but the three player game I think is still pretty good.  Above three can still be fun, but tends to be much more messy, and harder to strategize.  To play with more players it is probably better to use one of the expansions that opens the board up right at the start.

Fun and light, plays at a decent speed.  Combining with Inns and Cathedrals + Traders and Builders gives just enough extra strategy that the randomness factor dies down a bit.

RATING: 8
Aesthetically pleasing experience and good thinking to optimize. When playing with 2 players, we often play "nice" - one could be very mean and create impossible situations. The other option with 2 players would be to have a cut-throat game of not "i want to make good points" but "i want to make more points than the other player".

With more players, it gets less calculable, but instead ad-hoc cooperations between players can occur.

We noticed that too many of the expansions make it a bit overcomplicated, especially for introducing new players.

After playing the game only once in the first year we owned it we brought it out at Christmas.  It didn't go over well with the family and i thought we would not be seeing it again soon.  Then we found the android version, my wife and I played a bunch of games on the tablet and started to see how this game was enjoyable.  Now it is one of our favorites. Originally ranked it lower.

Typical euro - bit dull. Expansions either add or make it tedious in the extreme. Much prefer Hunter Gathers and now The City. In fact with The City I don't think I'd want to play any other version.

RATING: 6.5
This was the game that sucked me into boardgaming.  It got to the point where we were playing mega-Carcassonne, using several hundred tiles, letting the tension build throughout the game as farms get connected to each other in convoluted and unexpected ways.  In some games, we end up with 7 or 8 meeples competing for a single massive farm.  The L-shaped road piece is the greatest single tile in the game.  So much damage can be done using this unassuming tile.

Personally, I don't like the rules in the expansions that allow a player to eventually free meeples from the board.  It's fun to trap your opponent's meeples and force them to look for a specific tile, watching them squirm the longer and longer they wait for that elusive tile.  You can really get an edge over your opponent if you make them squirm and lose focus on what they need to do.

Fun tile laying game, good 'intro' or 'gateway' game. Mechanics are simple and easy to teach, the hardest part to explain is the scoring of farmers at the end.

I played it with having 2 tiles on hand all the time. Drawing 1 tile makes it too random, waiting for the tile you need or making you play a useless move. Excellent family game, also rather short without expansions.

I absolutely love this game, and there was a point when I thought it was infinitely replayable, but then I made the awful mistake of playing a game with all 17 expansions, and it was that point I discovered I was dead wrong.

Be careful which expansions you use together, and how many you use, because at first glance this seems like an infinitely expandable concept, but it's really not.

A subtle game that is like a familiar favorite tea.  There isn't much intensity, there isn't any killing.  There is a good game here, mostly strategy that is gleaned in multiple plays.

I enjoy this game because its simple and gives interesting options each turn. Played with a few people who have only ever played monopoly and it blew their minds. They adore this game and want to play it every game night. It's a great game to pull out and play with others who are unsure about board games but know they DO NOT want to play monopoly.

The theme is totally not my thing however. If there was a fantasy/sci-fi theme for this it would be almost perfect.

With more play of this game, it is soooo easy to play, and very enjoyable.   Like a more fun game of chess.   

I love that you can work on your own progression, while also working on watching what your opponent(s) are doing and prepare to block them, or just make their progression harder.

Very addicting, and I think it is because it is so easy to play.   Barely any setup/takedown, making multiple piles of tiles makes shuffling virtually unnecessary, scoring is a breeze once you know how.

Great game and reputation is deserved.

For an abstract with hidden information with the drawing of tiles this is still a great game. Great theme and has quite a bit of tricks and manuevars and strategy in tile laying. I highly recommend this one. The learning curve on this one is really small, takes one game to get the gist of it really well. Makes a great family or party game. Even someone who appears to be in dead last with people in their 50 or 100 point totals already can pull in for 2nd place or even the lead with well timed and planned strategy in tile laying and meeple placement of farmers etc. The expansions are a must. And I highly suggest getting the Towers.

I highly suggest playing with 3 or more players!

Three plays to date.  Very enjoyable.  This is our first tile laying game. Alessa and I played it twice and then Sue joined for a third game.

Have ordered a couple of expansions and look forward to trying them as well.

My wife loves this and asks to play it frequently - which makes it one of the best games in my collection.  The more I play, the more strategy I see in it.  Plus it's portable, easy to teach, and scales well. I think this will be a winner for a long time to come.

*UPDATE*
This has become one of my standard gateway games, my wife's favorite 2 player game, and a good "dinner and game night" game with other couples.  2 player games are quick and vicious, allowing for a rematch.  4 player games are more random, but offer an enjoyable game that's not too long and not too complex for non-gamers.
We almost always play it with the I&C expansion.

I went through the usual progression on Carc -- played it A LOT to start with, then got burned out after about 40 plays.  I've been thinking about the need to play it again, though.  I just store all the expansion tiles in the giant Carc tile draw bag and grab out a couple of handfuls to adjust game length.  (With new players we just use the base rules and maybe inns/cathedrals; all other icons are just decorations.)

Surprisingly we haven't always had that much luck teaching it, maybe because we have the two "classic" expansions mixed in (T&B, I&C). One of the few games we have that plays six - it does get a bit slow, but if we have six people over then it's more of a social gathering anyway.

light, fairly fast, fun - not exceedingly deep. What is probably deepest is controlling the topology. A good bit of luck in the tile drawing, which is somewhat compensated by the fact that you draw a lot of tiles. House rules we sometimes play by: you keep a hand of 3 tiles at any time.

   Carcassonne meets every criteria of mine that makes a game worthwhile.  It has a unique theme, it is easy to learn, simple to play, and strategically challenging (if you want it to be).

   I have played it on the Xbox too, and while I have tried some of the expansions, I do not own any.

A good introductory game, it plays differently depending on the number of players. I love how the the map looks at the end of a game. I prefer 2 player games because of the cutthroat factor.

Downgraded to a 6 after playing Samurai, a far superior tile laying game, imho.

RATING: 8.5
I love that this game has become so customizable, allowing you to add whatever expansions or, thanks to ebay, pieces of expansions that you want. My set is only about %50 more tiles than the stock set but it is still so useful as a gateway game that I think I may never add more for risk of adding too much complexity. The randomness can be annoying, and I think you can get screwed too easily with just the base set, but a few extra tiles really let's this game breathe. A great relaxing game. I love it with two, but with more its a great gateway. I just don't play it with my gamer friends.

A great game, very simple and very fun!  Plays quick, and looks good.  Couldn't ask for more - a solid investment, and good for getting new people into the hobby, that doesn't lose it's appeal over time like Settler's does.

Edit: with the kids old enough to play this, we re-acquired a copy. Ellie says she finds it boring but Andrew enjoys it. Hopefully this will see a good deal of play together as a family.

We usually only played this with 2 players. Problem was, people tended to wander off in their own direction and there was little conflict, leading to a boring game. The expansions are interesting (at least the first couple) but overwrought for a lightweight design. We gave the game & first 2 expansions to my sister & her family, and just play Carcassonne: the Castle now.

Best with two players, played in a reckless way. If the players don't "attack" each other or get into each others way it's a rather boring (but still okay) game. New players will often play this way, but after several plays it becomes more confrontational.

I like the first expansion, but I prefer to play without any of the other expansions. Actually, I like Hunters and Gatherers or The Castle a bit more.

Great game, especially for those new to gaming.

I especially like the basic game without the river and with only two players.  

If we ever play without Farmers (as we do on occasion, with new players, or with children) we usually play with one or two fewer Meeples.  I have a lot of expansions, but since getting a good range of other games I find the simple elegence of the 'raw' Carcassonne best for us.  If we want something more complex or with a slightly different feel then we play a diferent game.

7.8 with two players.  7.5 generally.  Less with the other expansions added in.

After Settlers, Carcassonne was my next introduction into the wide world of board gaming. As such, it still holds a very dear place in my heart. But that's not the only reason I rate it a 10. This game withstands the test of time and it is designed in such a way that the simple inclusion of 10 extra tiles and a couple of new mechanics can change the game entirely. I love the way the board fluctuates from one game to the next and I love the tension that builds up as the stack of tiles gets lower and your chances of drawing the tiles you really need become less likely. I also enjoy the subtle player interaction that can occur when two or more people are duking it out to win a certain feature.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A classic for a reason, but difficult to articulate exactly why it is one of my favourite games - and so prevalent throughout the hobby. There is certainly satisfaction to be had in watching the world develop as it is built by the players throughout the game. Mechanically, the game is incredibly smooth and intuitive but remains deeply engaging - and each tile that is flipped offers the player with unexpectedly numerous choices. 

A huge portion of my enjoyment of the game stems from how different each play feels as well; sometimes it's a real cut-throat affair as people are consistently building into one another's farms and cities and other times it's a serene affair, as I can calmly build roads and abbeys undisturbed by the players elsewhere in the world we are building. Furthermore, despite the game so often being very interactive and very "thinky" it never feels mean-spirited, slow-paced or frustrating. Highly enjoyable game.

Sort of like playing a roller coaster ride: you draw a tile, play it and then play one of your guys. You have no control over what you draw, only where you play it. I suppose this would work as an entry game to heavier Euros, but there's others that I prefer anyway.

It did give to gaming the ubiquitous meeple shape, so there's that.

This is probably one of those games that allows you to attract more people into the world of board games. A good evening entertainment for beginners and a great "warm up" for gamers. Moreover, it is possible to play it both seriously (by looking after remaining pieces) and lightly.

This is a classic.

I love puzzles and playing carcassonne is kinda like building a puzzle. It's a fun light game of placing tiles and getting points for completing certain things. A great game to play with non- board game people. The strategy is all in the farmers. Because of this limited aspect of strategy, more serious board gamers may not enjoy it as much. However, I find it enjoyable as a not so intense but yet still entertaining game.

Wonderful designed gateway game that in my opinion passed it's peak a few years and many expansions before.
Unfortunately I will not even think about playing it again ever or soon (I don't know yet which one it is for me)

It's like a good old movie you really like to watch but you turn it down everytime you have the DVD in hands because you need to see it on TV with commercial breaks to interrupt it (otherwise you would see that it is just a movie among others).
But I can't watch this special movie anymore...sadly.

RULES: ***** - The rule set is terrific. You can easily get the flow of the game in mere minutes. Of course, there are known issues with farmer scoring, but 4th edition rules are fairly intuitive and easy to grasp.
STRATEGY: ** - There is a possibility to have a vague plans of what you are going to do next, but you honestly can't plan much before the game, it's a lot more about reacting correctly to the current events.
TACTICS: **** - This game would be a perfect tactical game, but it isn't just because you have only one tile a turn to place and you can't choose which one it is, hence the choices get somewhat limited by your tile draw.
LUCK: *** - Most of the time you can find a proper place for the drawn tile to be placed, however, sometimes it gets very frustrating when you can't draw anything but roads while someone steals your city. Having a hand of three tiles would have been a lot better, and a lot more evil... But that's just thinking aloud.
PLAYER INTERACTION: ***** - Believe me when I say this game can get evil. Tension is high and fights for the biggest cities and largest farms can get mad. Furthermore, the turns are short and the pace is fast.
REPLAYABILITY: *** - Without expansions, I'd say the game is very fun, but the fun doesn't last long enough and the game does get repetitive after a while. A couple of better expansions to expand your opportunities will easily fix this though.
THEME: ** - It is an abstract. It has almost nothing to do with city or road building or farming. It could use any other theme and be just as succesful. However, I can't deny that all those cute cartoonish graphics on tiles do add some needed flavour, so the theme, however thin, does provide a nice touch.
BALANCE: **** - The cities and farms seem to be the hugest point sources in the game, leaving cloisters and roads in a supportive role. I would rather this was fixed, and I believe that certain expansions address that problem fairly succesfully. Anyway, the game is quite good without any expansions as well, it's just that you have to concentrate on cities more.
DOWNTIME: ***** - None! Grab a tile, place a tile, place a meeple, score! There is almost no place for analysis and the game flow is awesome. You will never feel bored while playing the game (not speaking of repetitiveness kind of boredom, of course).
ACCESSIBILITY: **** - Anyone can play the game. I mean it. You can teach your Grandma play it, and she is very likely to like it. It's easy, it's fast, it's fun. My biggest complaint is that the game absolutely sucks with more than three players, because it gets too chaotic. Otherwise, you can't ask for a better game to fit everyone's taste.

Perfect match for everybody - starting from 6 until 99 and on :-) I really liked the game play. The map and circumstances are always changing.

I know it doesn't look like I've played this game a lot, but this is the game that hooked me in 2010. I wandered into the Board Room Game Center -- it was in Freeland at the time -- and owner Aaron "Quiz" Quesnel pulled it off the shelf and taught it to me.

I bought the game either that day or soon after. It was the only game I had, and I got lots of expansions for it, which all currently reside in the original box in printed tuckboxes and little plastic boxes for components.

I didn't find BGG until about two years ago or so, and by then I had played the mess out of Carcassone. Today, it doesn't get played much because there is so much more awesomeness on my shelf.

But I'm never getting rid of it.

Kids' Collection.

Great play with kids and I score it in that context.  To them, patterns is almost second nature and I think that this game fits right in.  

In that light though, the expansions rules make it too confrontational and make the game less fun.  For adults they do add more strategy, but then I have better games to play if I want strategy.

For the first few games, it appeared that luck was the most important factor. Then you start to see all these devilishly clever uses for tiles and ways to undermine someone else's goals. Lots of skill is required to master.
Still, carcassonne doesn't have enough game mechanics or strategy considerations for me to love.
There just isn't alot of planning or strategy. You are really just looking for the most effective use of each tile as they randomly appear, and trying to understand how to capitalize with each map as it evolves.
Your plans are more likely to fall through as succeed, and adaptation is key.

Played this several times, base game and version with many many expansions - and every time I was bored after the first 5 minutes.

This game has neither strategy nor tactic to consider. Just draw a random tile, place it where it might potentially help you and not help or hinder the opponent, place one of your pieces if you want and you are done.

Unless you memorized all the tiles and know how many "outs" are still in the stacks this is a completely random game.

El juego de introducción con el que intento enganchar a los novatos en los juegos de mesa. Me ha funcionado siempre bastante bien. Como juego me gusta (más aún con alguna expansión como POSADAS Y CATEDRALES o CONSTRUCTORES Y COMERCIANTES) y no lo juego tanto como me gustaría. Soy muy fan de como cambia la mentalidad en una partida a 2 (Robar) vs una partida a 3-4 (Compartir). Es más escribiendo esto me estoy dando cuenta de que quiero jugar ahora. Las GRANJAS le dan el punto de estrategia justo para ser un juego de introducción. Finalmente, el aspecto visual de la mesa con las LOSETAS me encanta, es obligada una foto al terminar la partida.

  A great game for light gamers.  My wife and boys (7 and 8) 'get it' and really enjoy it.  my 8 y.o. is a genius with the farms (sometimes conceptually difficult).  It works for kids but don't write it off as a kids game.  We own the Big Box collection which comes with four expansions.  Some of the expansions add enough game play to rate higher than my eight and create some diabolical moves.  If you decide to buy I highly suggest the Big Box collection.  It will save you a lot of money in the end and provide significantly more play options to keep the game fresh and interesting.  If you add all of the expansions together you will have a long, medium wieght game for a rainy day.

What a game to be introduced to board games. The missus wasn't so sure when I first got it just by the looks of the box alone, but this is now our go to game. Whether playing at home in front of the TV or in a pub with a pint, a nice casual game that anyone who isn't into board game would enjoy.

After dozens of plays, I can safely say that this is still one of my favorite games. I own most of the expansions, each of which changes the game enough to keep things fresh and interesting every time you play. I like how the game is principally tactical but there is always an element of strategy, and though it can get competitive, the game play feels very light and casual. It's almost like Scrabble but with puzzle tiles instead of letters and without all the miserable downtime.

This is a wonderful tile laying game.  Plays easily with family and/or gamers.  The toughest part is explaining how farmers are scored.  Before you start playing, make sure everyone is on the same set of rules.  It appears that everyone has settled on 3rd edition at this point.  I personally don't care for the fact that a two tile castle scores 4 points instead of 2, but I will follow along with the 3rd edition just for the sake of  consistency.

I utterly fail to see why this game is lauded so highly on BGG. It's ok, but that's about it. I've seen many reviewers and forum posts saying things like "it gets fun when you add in expansion so-and-so." If a game only gets fun when you buy additional content for it, then that content should have been included in the original game. I refuse to sink even more money into buying content for a game that failed to impress me with its core system.

An instant classic.  Loved it from first play.  The first expansion helps - by adding the big meeple in particular - but not convinced of the need for any of the rest.  

I now prefer 'The City', which I think is the very best of the various flavours on offer.

RATING: 6
Great game for when we want something low-stress and easier on the mental RAM. Wish there was a bit more longterm strategy you could develop but it is hard not knowing what tiles you will be getting. With us it seems one person always gets a vast majority of monasteries and then goes on to win handily.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Great light-weight tile-laying gateway game that can scale from family game to a more medium-weight strategic game by adding some expansions (also using some house rules/variants to make it "friendlier" or more "cutt-throat").
++ Simple, elegant tile-laying / worker placement mechanisms.
++ Good replayability due to the random order tiles are drawn and also due to the high number of expansions you can add.
++ To reduce the luck of the draw and to make it more strategic several house rules/variants can be used easily and effectively:
* You can draw 2 or 3 tiles that you keep in your hand, and after playing one, you redraw (this also speed up the analysis time of the tiles drawn since you already have your tiles durings the other players' turn).
* You can have some tiles (between 3 to 5) facing up near the scoring board and players must choose from these tiles. Chosen tiles are replaced immediately (like cards in Ticket To Ride).
++ Easy to teach, fast to set-up and fast to play.
++ There are severeral expansions available for this game (which is useful to refresh the game when we have overplayed it).


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- The luck of the draw can be frustrating at time, but this can be made a more strategic game with some variants.
-- The area control part of this game can make this game too cutt-throat when playing against casual players or wife! (thus some house rules have been made)
-- Since I hate sorting tiles when adding or removing an expansion, we always plays with all the tiles, but not all the rules (before the game we state with which expansion we desire to play and ignore some icon on some tiles) but this make the game longer that it should (thus our variant to randomly remove a handful of tiles from the draw bag at the beginning of the game).

I'm starting to come around a bit on this game. I still am not a huge fan, but I can at least see it's appeal to the right crowd. For the serious gamer, this is still a game you won't be suggesting much, but if you have smart, non-gaming friends this can be a solid entry for doing somthing casual with them that will engage them without being threatening. For the fan of El Grande or Modern Art or Settlers of Catan, though, this doesn't have a whole lot to recommend it. If you do play, the first two expansions (the River, now included in the basic set, and The Expansion) are recommended in the strongest possible terms. Better yet, go direct to the more entertaining and visually appealing Hunters & Gatherers. Certainly later expansions should probably be avoided.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Some players are turned off by the perceived lack of strategic depth in Carcassonne, and that's why I've given it an 8.5 and not a 9.  Nevertheless, this one of the few board games that everyone should own. It's a much friendlier game than most, but it still leaves room for competition as players exercise their powers of persuasion over one another.  Player interaction is a necessity, although nothing concrete is gained or lost during these discussions.  You have to get what you can without stepping on anybody's toes, otherwise you will find your projects blocked and unfinished.  This is a great game for families and new gamers, and my copy has earned its keep amongst the collection.

Like a "modern day chess"; this game is a classic already.  The rules are simple, with the scoring being the hardest to catch on to, but once you play a game and actually do the scoring at the end things will suddenly catch on and you'll start to see the strategies more clearly.  This is a gateway game for sure and I'm currently using it for just that so that I can coerce a nongamer into starting on board games on a regular basis and he's fallen in love with this calling it "relaxing" and has stated SEVERAL times: "Man, I LOVE this game!"

RATING: 6
Draw a tile and place it to form a map of Carcassonne, placing your meeple on the tile you just played if you'd like.  Once you have a meeple on the map, you'll want to complete the feature you placed your meeple on for points.  It's as simple as that!

Fun filler game if played without expansions, appeals to a wide variety of gamers, and a fairly set amount of time to play.  Virtually an infinite number of expansions these days if you're looking to spice things up!

A classic. This and Catan started it all for me. Numerous expansions for this game.  Most of which are silly and unneeded in my opinion but some are worth while.

During my one play online (2 player), I spent much of the game waiting around for a piece that never came.

The first game was not much fun, but I'm willing to give it another shot.

I play Carcasonne with the variant of one having one extra tile open in front of you. So when draw another, you have a choice between the two. A good deal more interesting. Without that alteration, this game is probably only a 5 for me.

Hunters & Gatherers is IMO the superior version. I recommend you buy that one instead of the original. More interesting. Further, the theme works better (better fleshed out) and graphics are more compelling.

Great tile-laying gateway game.  The rules are simple (although Farming rules can be a bit complicated to non-gamers) and there is quite a bit of strategy and depth to be had.  

The game scales well although is probably the deepest and most and engaging at 2 players.  The game gets very cut-throat this way unless the players actively avoid blocking their opponent.  We love the complicated interplay and jostling for position.

The game is also well expanded with tons of options and very cheap.  Highly recommended as a baseline strategy game most people will enjoy.

One of the best family games, also when you have no time or no mood for tough braineaters it is a good position. The randomness sometimes can kill the play, but usually it is on acceptable level and you can try to control it. Good as a 2 and more-player game, also with kids.

Solid game.  Had fun helping everyone decide where to go.  Made for a fun atmosphere while playing.

Went down in my standard because it just seems so dry.  We played it with some friends and downgraded from 8 to 6. (4/3/09).  Heather has started to play a little on XBox Live and it is growing on her.  Perhaps we will play some more with the right people (ie Tommy and Doris).

Heather and I have been playing this at night and I do not enjoy it.  Controls suck and Heather seems to really know how to steal farms and cities...  The randomness also blows.  Downgrading to a 5.  (5/20/09)

The ironic thing is that the BGG recommendations for this game are all games that I own and absolutely LOVE!

The game just doesn't grab me.  If you're into pure strategy, then this may be a good game.  I tend to enjoy a bit more randomness in the games I play.  I also think the pieces and the tiles are kind of doofy-looking.  I do, however, enjoy similar wooden pieces as seen in Settlers of Catan.

This was my first designer game.

We play the basic game, but we draw a new tile at *the end* of your turn, so that you can plan your move while the other players are playing.

However, I think having a hand of 2 or 3 tiles will substantially change the game, and we don't play that way.

We realized we were playing "wrong" when I got the iOS app - the AI is a lot more mean than we were when we first started playing.

RATING: 6
Essentially you bet on what things will turn out big in the end. Nice, but in addition to the luck factor of drawing the right tiles in the right moments, which has quite some impact, a satisfying game depends more than usual on on how serious your fellow players are: A single randomly acting player or a player who never allies with a certain other player for external reasons are much harder to ignore than in, say, Puerto Rico or Caylus. Otherwise, the possibilty of intentionally harming your opponents is often underestimated in Carcassonne - and a lot of fun, although you will regret it since cooperation is key.

A game with simple rules. Draw a tile, place the tile, and maybe place a meeple on that tile.

But the options are larger. Place the tile to block an opponent? To expand one of my structures? To start a new structure? To attempt to horn in on an opponent's structure? To enhance the value of a farm I'm expecting? As for the meeple, do I place it for short term gain, or end game scoring?

The new bishop rules aren't necessary, but it is fun to accumulate points with them.

However, to make this good game into a great game, the first expansion is required.

TThe simple play and evocative, yet not overbearing, artwork make for a perfect introduction-to-nerd-gaming tool. I'm not a huge fan but I did like it a lot better after adding some expansions.

REVISIT: Actually, the base game without the River is pretty tight and cutthroat; I don't mind it a bit. With two players it is tight and fairly brutal.

RATING: 8
Somehow, I managed to make it to 2014 (that's something like 12 years of being active in the hobby) without playing Carcassonne.

I understand why this game has such a lasting appeal. It's a REALLY good weight - it's deep enough to be interesting for gamers and simple enough that I could see explaining it to a non-gamer easily, and actually having them get something out of it. I really like the curve of the game where you start out with very limited options and gradually as the game progresses you wind up with more and more to think about - feels perfect for a gateway game. The choices themselves are sufficiently juicy, and the not-insignificant amount of luck ties neatly into a fun risk-reward system and the game's profoundly interesting social landscape.

The game has this really fun semi-coop element (especially at larger player counts where you really have to rely on other players) that really promotes tabletalk and keeps people engaged. I've never seen such a simple dry Euro get people talking so much before - each tile draw sees players crowding around the active player, discussing the pros and cons of potential placements, and how they affect other players.

The only things that truly bug me is the farmer scoring and the road tiles. Farmers feel overly complicated and it's just hard to judge whose farmers are doing well at any given point. And roads just feel underpowered.

Note: Always play this where you redraw at the END of your turn so you have a full round to consider your next move. This should really just be the official rule.

This was my gateway game, but I'm finding I like it less and less.  I seem to be the only person in my family who tracks on farmers (even though I remind them at the beginning), so I've never lost.

I like this game although there are others  I would play in preference.  One of the big advantages is you can always play it with non gamers (perhaps leaving the farmers out). If playing with the farmers I prefer to play it with the river expansion which avoids the big farm syndrome. 26 Sep 2005

Ah Carcassonne... What fond memories I have of drawing your tiles and building you up to a thriving wonderful city. This is one that our group has a copy of and a couple of expansions (which personally, I think are essential after you've played a couple times) and I keep going back and forth on if we should pick up a copy or not. I think I want it, but there are so many other games that I want more. I do love Carcassonne, and it will always have a special place in my heart.

This was the very first German board game in my collection.  As the prototypical tile-laying, area control game, Carcassonne embodies some of the best aspects of family Euro games - beautiful components (including the signature, now-ubiquitous "meeples"); tactical and strategic gameplay arising from simple rules; a high degree of player interaction; no player-elimination; and a short playing time.  However, there is a significant amount of luck involved with this game, especially when the base game is played without any expansions.  Placement of farmers and competing for control of farms are key to victory and sometimes, who wins or loses depends on whether or not a player draws the tile(s) they require to connect an isolated farmer to a contested farm.  Familiarity with the tile distributions will help to improve one's play, but this game quickly becomes tiresome (unless one purchases expansions to keep things lively).  Works best with two players, but still highly enjoyable for up to four.  A must-play for anyone new to Euro games.

The best part of this game is that it's ready to play within seconds. No setup necessary. Most strategic game takes around 5 minutes to setup and is boring to do so but not this. This is because the board is built during the game. This also adds high replay value. 

So far only played with two players and it works great. It's very interactive in a very subtle way, something few games manage. 

So one could say it's very luck driven because you draw what tile to play. But I think it's one of those play with what you got games. 

The most negative part of this game is the incredible boring theme. Although very pleasant artwork the boring theme (or lack thereof) gives this game a lower score. With the mechanics in this game it could have been in space, monsters or anything really but instead it consists of villages, road, cloisters and farms.

I just don't get what's so special about this game...  The endgame is anticlimactic. When the last tile is played, the game ends... and this is followed by math to figure out who won. This ruins the game for me.

In my opinion, the perfect 1st game. Simple, quick, pretty, with real decisions. Can be played brutal or friendly. I actually liked it much less when I learned I was playing a rule wrong. We always played you could play in someone else's castle, road, whatever and majority won upon completion. It made the meeples much more scarce, the game a little more vicious, and a little more non-gamer friendly, IMO. In fact, after several more playings with the official rules, I do not like the game at all and would rate it maybe a 3. With my variant though, it remains a 7.

[u]January 10:[/u]This was a gift to my parents. Last time I went and see them in October (to get Lasik surgery ), my dad and I sat down and played it for the first time. Well I must say I was surprised to like it. At first, it seemed like something great for my parents to enjoy but I didn't expect to like it very much myself. I was wrong, the gameplay is simple and very fluid.

We played 3 times during this week and after the second and third play I was also beginning to see how to mess my father's plan by bringing majorities into "his" cities, and also how that could be dangerous (you do block 2 meeples and if the city is hard to close... well you could be missing these two meeples later on...).

I enjoy all Carcs as ideal two-player games: Relaxing pastime, accessible play, and I'm not normally bummed when I lose because watching the countryside develop is just enjoyable. And what's not good about a game you can play with your grandmother. There was a while when I was swayed into the slightly superior elegance of H&G and the other Carc expansions, but I've come to appreciate the big swings of original Carc. I really only play this as a 2-player. (It just doesn't do it for me with more)

I understand why so many gamers think there are very little decisions to actually make. But, really, I just enjoy this game as an activity to go with conversation and a good friend. I get why you think there isn't much game here, but I wouldn't feel right without the time I've spent playing this. It is a joy.

Such a great game.  This is one of the first "modern" board games that I played and fell in love immediately.

Simple mechanics and very easy to teach.  Just grab a tile and play it, then decide if you want to put a meeple on the tile to possibly score points.

I've heard people say that the scoring can be confusing, but that is where the strategy of this game is deep.  Simple gameplay and beautiful tableau at the end game will make you want to play over and over.  Trying to steal scoring areas (especially farms) is what will keep you playing this game for years and years.

Base game is amazing.  Throw in an expansion from time to time to keep things fresh.

I can't be the only person who uses this as a gateway drug, and I can't be the only one it was used as a gateway drug on. Christmas market trip to Germany organised by work, got talking in the bar to a couple on it who had gone just to buy games at non-UK prices. Carcassone came out and that was that. 

Expansions come and go, some are largely pointless (I'm looking at you, Princess and Goblin) but it's a game I always enjoy when it comes off the shelf - even if that is a bit of a rarity these days.

RATING: 8
Tile placement game that I describe to non-gamers as a combination of dominoes and chess. Easy to learn, barring the farmers can be somewhat tricky to grasp at first.  Game moves quickly and has a surprising amount of strategic depth that will be hidden to you on the first few plays.

Carcassonne is my go-to gateway game for people who enjoy pure strategy games (no conflict, no trading, no social, chess, etc).  Depending on the player I'll typically go a round without farmers, and then toss them in for round two.  AND there WILL be a round two. :)

Quickly a favorite at our house.. And since my wife loves it, Carcassonne gets more play in the house. Fantastic as a gateway game for our non-gamer friends, but usually requires a second play before they fully "get it." Carc gets the most play out of any of the games we own and is the most requested among friends, both gamers and non-gamers. It works well as a group game and exceedingly well as a very confrontational 2-player game. 

[b]We play only third edition rules.[/b] :) We play with Basic, both River sets, King & Scout, Inns & Cathedrals, Traders & Builders and Die Katharer. We are very skeptical about what The Count, Princess & Dragon and The Tower have to offer, so we haven't bothered. 

[i]House Rules[/i] - Game starts using the river (using River 1 & 2), we start with the river fork and set three river ends aside for after the other river pieces are played.. expanding the river in three directions at once. We use colored glass markers (similar to Go pieces) as scoring markers instead of sacrificing a meeple to the scoreboard. We also use these glass markers to mark who built the biggest city & road during play and to assist in counting completed cities and roads at the end of the game for King & Scout scoring. 

[i]Note[/i] that this rating I've given Carc is for playing with the above mentioned expansions and 3rd edition rules. Playing Carc with just the basic set and 1st ed rules would be a rating of 8.

Yeah, this one just doesn't do it for me.  It's fun to play, and I'll play with non-gamers to see if they like it - but why when there are so many other awesome games out there?  This one is so-so for me.  A little too light maybe.

This is a great 2 player games but gets progressively worse with more player.  Unfortuneately my other half only likes this with more players so it rarely gets played anymore.

Carcassonne was the second "gateway" game that I bought in Jan. 2009 (after Ticket to Ride). Consequently, it has been a mainstay in my collection from the beginning.

Carcassonne is an excellent gateway game for a couple of reasons--the rules are simple and straightforward, and a turn consists of simply placing a tile, and optionally sticking a meeple on it. It can be played very politely, or incredibly cutthroat. It's a great two player game, but plays well up to four as well. And finally, the result of the game is a very attractive map that everyone has worked on together--there's something rewarding about that.

If you plan on playing this with any regularity and with any desire to add some strategy, then the Inns and Cathedrals expansion is essential.

A decent game, however, the math is difficult to figure out and the scoring is odd at times.  Additionally, it is a very one sided game.  One person is going to win and they are going to win BIG.  The rivers expansion helped a litte, but unfortunately no enough to balance out play.  Worth picking up if it is on sale, but don't pay full price.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Good game as an introduction to Eurogames.
Excellent balance of duration, complexity, and originality.
Be sure though NOT to start playing with all the expansions as it will very probably be too confusing.

I prefer the prehistoric version, but it adds very few twists and overall playing experience is similar.

This is a family favorite, especially as we use it as a gateway game to introduce new people to German games.  We're not afraid to share it with people who are strictly party/Milton Bradley gamers because it's accessible.  The expansions make for great, more complex play.

Main Positives: Nice art, players can be competitive

Fun Factor: Medium to High
Complexity: Except for the farmer, everything is easy to explain and learn.
Replayability: Maybe I could play this once in a while. I tried it with the river expansion.

Main Frustrations and Caveats:
AP. Which is why I prefer to house rule it and have players draw a tile AFTER placing one. But at the same time, having pieces stuck on the board is a bummer.

It has taken me six years of gaming to comment on Carcasonne. I haven't played for several years but my nephews copy ended on my bookshelf and I tried it with my wife who was tolerant of it.

Is high as a 9 played in two with the three tiles rule and low as a 3 played in 5 with only alot of expansions and just one tile. I've averaged the evaluation between the various possibilities.

I really like the new artwork, I think the old version was too fussy and looked quite dated. Not only are these tiles brighter and clearer, making playing them easier, but they're also fun: on one tile there's a donkey in the stables, on another there's a robber hiding in the bushes, etc. I do hope they publish some matching expansions soon!

Entertaining, and it's improved by 3rd edition scoring, but I'm not very good at it, and the game doesn't inspire me to spend time getting better.

The one building game I can play with my parents! It's that simple to learn. It is the first placement game I play with my son too. And it holds up for some geekier troupes. That alone is a big plus for Carcassonne.
Its fast, beautiful (with some akward architecture) and fun. Though you need to be carefull how many expansions you want to use as this directly influences gamelenght. A game that becomes too long mostly ends with everyone tired and halfhearted.

This was one of the 2 first games I purchased when i got into the whole board game craze. I loved this game and played the heck out of it. Now 200+ games later this rarely finds the table. My GF still plays it online and asks to play so I play with her but have no strong desire to play it any other time. Not that I don't enjoy or like the game...it is just played out. As such I have rated it a 7 but I highly recommend it to anyone new to games and couples. I did rate this a strong 8 before.

Hunters and Gatherers of Carcasonne is the far better game, but doesn't expand to six players.  That keeps me coming back to basic Carcasonne.  The 2 player game is particularly good and is perhaps where the base Cacrassonne game shines both best and better than the other Carcassonne games.

The bottomless supply of expansions bring Carcassonne to the game it deserves to be: a long rasher of careful probability measurement and opportunistic mayhem.

Of all my games, Carc has probably seen the most table time.  The beauty of this simple tile laying game is the mixture of short term tactics and the long term strategy of farm building.  On top of that is the immense replay ability Carc possesses and the scalability from many players to only two.  I do believe the sweet spot is four though.  Although I'm a little burned out currently by Carc, I will always bring this one to the table with new gamers.  Should I venture, "Gateway Game."?

Christmas gift 2006. It hasn't grabbed me. I feel underwhelmed by this game, but I want to hold my judgement until I get a chance to play with some experienced players. Perhaps they could show me what I am missing that makes this game so compelling.

I like this game much more than I did at first. The Inns and Cathedrals expansion makes it better. It's a nice light game with enough variety in strategy to keep me coming back for more. Upped my rating to an 8.

Gets a little dry after you get more into games with resource management and other mechanics. But Carcassonne is still a good abstract-feeling simple area-control game. Great for introducing people to the game, and retains a leisurely pace even when played cutthroat. 

Basically, it's a little ho-hum and far too simple to the point of being more of a group activity than something investing and intriguing.

The more I play it the more I like it. I used to play with my daughter, but the game unveiled its qualities playing competitively in a group of 4-5 players. At first I did not understand the usefulness of farmers. In our recent plays the positioning of tiles and farmers has turned to be a game in the game. Similarly I've liked the struggles that can unfold for cities. And it's intriguing the relationship between city size and farmer values. Very simple game but, nonetheless, interesting.

Perfect girlfriend game. Perfect family game. Good games club game. 

You need a lot of table space and more time than you expect with this, but it is a deserved classic that brings together lots of thoughtful elements. You need to play this game about 3 times before you "get" it, but once you have, it is very easy to get on the table as a 2 or 3 player game. I feel very comfortable when thinking about this game, there are a lot of warm feelings surrounding it.

RATING: 10
What a delightful game!  This is my favorite light Euro.  It is easily accessible to newcomers yet varied and strategic enough for frequent gamers.  Each expansion also seems to add and enrich the game.

To be fair though, the base game all alone has a few shortcomings for me: the lack of a 6th player, the incomplete feel of a total package, and too short.  Inns & Cathedrals make up the first two points while Traders and Builders takes care of the last 2 points.  I rarely play the game without at least these two expansions.  Even if I don't use all the rules, I keep all the tiles in the game.

So basic vanilla Carc probably deserves a score of an 8 for me.  Hunters & Gatherers and Ark of the Covenant are the better basic games.  But with the expansions, Carcassonne is impossible to beat.

I had heard so many good things about this, but every time I looked at pictures or reviews I thought "this is so bland." How in the world could you have an enjoyable game by placing a tile, and then claiming it by deciding to put a little man on it or not? I got into modern board games to get away from chess-like abstract things like this.

Someone at work was having a moving sale, and had this up for grabs for $10 or so. I figured what the heck, for $10 I can at least say I've tried a classic. And man was I wrong.

This game IS an absolute classic and deserves all the praise its had heaped upon it over the years. It's charming in its simplicity - to me, it's the perfect "play on a lazy summer afternoon, drinking iced tea on a patio with the sound of droning lawnmowers in the background" game, but it also has a deceptively deep level of strategy that may not be apparent your first play or two. I've heard that the earlier big box expansions are pretty good, but honestly? I don't want to try them just yet. Carcassonne in its base form has a purity that I don't want to risk tarnishing with needless additions.

If there's one thing I could ding it for, its that it might be too lightweight for me to play over and over again in a short period of time, but it's a minor complaint. What a great way to have my expectations broken.

I've seen this one in action a few times and played one game, which I won overwhelmingly against an experienced opponent and another newbie. What this tells me is that the mechanics are easy to grasp, there's just enough luck involved yet you still feel rewarded by your moves and decisions. It's not super deep but one way to describe Carcassonne is that it is much more complex than it is difficult. Great game to teach and to play.

RATING: 7
Another of the great gateway games.  And it is a true gateway game.  This is one of the first real games that my niece has played (5 years old).  The spatial issues of fitting the tiles together are not taxing, but there is definitely an art to maximizing your position and possibilities, especially with farmers towards the late game.

Great game that has been 2-player almost exclusively. We always include the first two expansions in each game. This is a more relaxing experience that works when I am tired. It's more of an appetizer or light dessert game in that sense. I love the visual aspect of how the map unfolds as tiles are laid. It has an element of pattern recognition similar to putting together pieces of a puzzle.

Bought the board game.  The kids and I have played it several times and they like it enough.  We don't score or play farmers and they get frustrated with the limitations of the tiles and where they can go, but that's the game.  So far, it's on our "sure, I guess we can play that" list.

Simple to learn, simple to play. Lots of expansions for continued viability. Definitely go for Inns and Cathedrals and Traders and Builders.

This was my gateway game to modern board games. Burnt out on it after a dozen plays. Fairly random. And you have to have memorized the types and number of tiles if you want to succeed.

Tile laying at it's finest :) For my wife and me, this will probably be a timeless game that can be revisited no matter how long it's been since we last played.

I recently revisited Carcassonne.  The game is much more solid than I remembered, or have given it credit for.

I'd be willing to play this any time. I'm glad to own a copy.

Noviembre 07. Primer juego, 22€.

Uno de los clasicos para introducirse en los Eurogames. Los jugadores cogen una baldosa de la bolsa y la colocan pegada a otra de manera que continue el dibujo de la anterior. Cuando la coloque puede situar un 'meeple' y tomar control del camino, la ciudad, el monasterio o el campo dibujado en esa baldosa, siempre y cuando no continue algo que ya controle otro jugador. Segun va creciendo el tablero los objetos se hacen mas grandes o incluso se fusionan. Al terminar un camino o cerrar una ciudad, se devuelven los seguidores alli colocados y el que dominaba cobra sus puntos.

Carcassonne went through a "dark age" for me after intially being very interested in it as a two player game...it got a little old, mainly because I played it a lot.  Then the newbie flux of 2002-onward started happening and it seemed like it's all anyone wanted to play.  Some bad experiences with 4-6 player games put me off.  Lately, I've been playing the game again and I realize that it's a genuine classic- a game that will truly stand the test of time.  It's one of the best casual games and one of the rare games where accessibility and ease of play don't foreclose on fun.  It's essentially abstract, but the sense of building and "project management" makes up for that.  With all expansions (the Carcassonne Big Box), it's a 9 all the way...without expansions, it's more like a 7 so I'll split the difference and give it an 8.

RATING: 8
Nice tile-laying introduction for nongamers, and a suitable choice for gamers.  Solid all-purpose game.  Add in T&B and I&C, and Carc is great.  Without those two expansions, Carc is only a "6".

RATING: 5
It's a classic, so for that you may want to own it.  Frankly, and I know I;m in the minority, I do not like the art.  Also, it seems like this game takes a little bit too long for what it is.   I think I would enjoy it more if I had a group of committed people all playing for keeps but whenever it hits the table it seems like at least 1 or 2 people are still learning the game and make sub optimal moves which results in a predictable outcome.  There is nothing inherently exciting about drawing a tile or placing your meeple down.  Farmers are very important but are very confusing to new players.

A clever tile-laying game. The southern French city of Carcassonne is famous for its unique Roman and Medieval fortifications. The players develop the area around Carcassonne and deploy their followers on the roads, in the cities, in the cloisters, and in the fields. The skill of the players to develop the area will determine who is victorious.

Always fun to play, simple to learn, but lacks a little bit of cutting edge.  It's a tile laying game where you match the borders of each tile to ones already played and score points by investing a worker in ownership or attempted ownership over some feature of the map you're creating.  The strategy is to score as many points as you can, while making it difficult on your opponent(s) to score points on whatever they have invested or are trying to invest their small finite source of workers on. It's a high luck based game where it's difficult for anyone to be truly out of it.  Experience is important, but two people of equal experience will generally always have a competitive game due to the high amount of luck involved.  The best moments in the game are in completing massive cities, sneaking in and taking over someone else's massive city, getting massive points off of farms, and blocking off opponents from completing construction of something and thus taking away their workers from helping them to score points for them.

One of my favourite gateway games. I'm a fan of tile-laying games, and Carcassonne is one I'd play anytime. It is quite luck dependent, but that changes as the number of players go down. I'm happy for the 6th player expansion, though.

Ótimo jogo introdutório ao mundo de boardgames. Ou para quando se quer algo simples e rápido, sem necessidade de setup algum.
Estamos desbravando Carcassonne, uma província francesa, e a cada turno, ao acrescentar um pedaço ao mapa, devemos escolher se daremos uma atribuição a um dos nossos limitados Meeples, seja de Ladrão nas estradas, de Monge nos monastérios, de Cavaleiro nas cidades ou Fazendeiro nos campos. Quando o tile que completa a área que o meeple está é colocado, recebemos o meeple de volta e pontuamos. A loucura da contagem final de pontos pode gerar uma boa reviravolta, principalmente com muitos fazendeiros!

The first board game my partner and I ever bought. It was before I registered on BGG, so my official play count does not at all reflect the massive amount of plays we racked up in the beginning. Nowadays it is not my favourite game, and in fact I'll rarely play it without expansions (still furious I missed out on picking up Inns & Cathedrals before the artwork overhaul), but it will stay in my collection for being the game that pulled me into the hobby (or shoved me down into a financial pit depending on how you look at it).

Az elmúlt 2-3 évben elég sok játékkal ismerkedtem meg, elég sok játékot készítettem és szereztem be, de ez... ez viszi el a pálmát mind közül. FANTASZTIKUS játék, sohasem lehet megunni! (na jó, van amikor felkerül 1 hónapra a polcra, de szeretjük onnan levenni :) )

A kiegészítők nagyon jók, de vigyázni velük, mert nagyon megnöveli a játék idejét (nem csak a több lapka hanem a gondolkodás miatt is, főleg ha a grófos kieg. is használatban van) és ha mindet egyszerre használjuk akkor nagyon nehéz minden apró dologra figyelni és így kiválasztani a lehető legjobb döntést a lépésünk előtt.

A legjobb alapjátéknak tartom (én is ezzel a játékkal léptem be ebbe a társasjáték világba), szuper játék!

Update, 2011: gyakorlott gémerként már kevésbé tetszik és ritkábban kerül elő, de továbbra is állítom, hogy remek JÁTÉK! :) A szívem pedig nem engedi, hogy lejjebb vegyem a pontozását! :)

This is a staple classic I had to add to my collection. I have only played it once so far and we just played the bare minimum so we will be adding in the rivers the next time. I think so far it is a good gateway game or a filler game. There isn't a lot of depth to it or strategy. Sharing something someone else has started building almost seems really cheap but it gets you those points you need. 

It doesn't take up a lot of room on the table which is always nice for a gateway game. It doesn't seem as overwhelming that way. I feel like expansions or variants of this game are definitely needed for me to enjoy it but it is a simple enough game to teach and for people to understand so it will be hitting the table again soon.

A light favorite of my wife and me, for when we're too tired to play anything heavier. We play without the bothersome farmers, and play non-confrontationally (for my wife's sake) - don't take over each other's stuff, don't mess with their plans. We have several of the expansions but mostly only play Inns and Cathedrals.

Seems like I always get too many worthless tiles. It's better if you play with 2 or 3 tiles in hand, rather than just drawing a tile randomly.

This might be THE classic gateway game.  However, winning the game is highly dependent on picking up the right tiles.

I always feel relaxed and peaceful when playing this game.

Carcassonne... This game is only in my collection because my girlfriend was of the opinion we should have a small set of 'classics'. I am not particularly fond of buying multiple copies of slightly altered games unless there is good reason to. Since I started out with 'De Burcht' en 'Jagers & Verzamelaars' I really saw no need to own original Caracassonne too. But the ways of women are shrouded in mystery for mere males, of course.

The funny thing is that this game did not once come out of its box, too. We always play one of the other titles I already mentioned: they provide sufficient variation and fun. The somewhat strange rules governing the original (what's up with those hard to form churches??) have been replaced by much more fun and workable variants in the other titles. I really ought to 'lose' this title, but I'm afraid then I'll 'lose' several body parts too.

[b]Update[/b] In the end I did play the original a few more times, but everytime we agreed that the other variant Carcassonnes in our possession did a better job. So eventually the game was let go.

A great game, especially for two players (and there aren't enough of those).  There is a substantial luck component from the tile draw, and the scoring is a bit complicated (the farmer rules give us fits) but the board is very pretty and the little wooden pieces are nice.  The expansions make it bigger, but not necessarily better (they don't hurt though).

A great game - I even followed the first three expansion - then it became too much. 

One of the games, that I used to love - until I fell in the BSW*-gap: I loved the game, had too few players around playing with me - I started to play it on BSW - I got beaten there badly - I learned and got (somehow) better - I brought it on the table with friends - and I beat them so bad in the game, that nobody wanted to play it ever again with me ... :-(

Who knew laying tiles was so much fun. I love how Carcassonne plays well with just about anybody, and its possable to make the expansion tiles (at least the ones I have so far) work with just the basic rules, so I easily teach new players. Its a hit everytime we play!

I played H&G first so it is going to take a while to get use to the incomplete scoring mechanism.  I really like this game as it feels like making a puzzle.  And I can be as vicious (blocking or taking over other people's scoring) as I want.  Some days I just like putting the pieces down.  The monasteries are a little weird as there seems to be no strategy to them.  I will end up getting a couple expansions.  I have played a couple of them together in my first game and they all add nice little factors.  I don't know that I really want to make the game last much longer though.

RATING: 4
Tremendously unengaging game which only gets worse (and more random) with additional players. Sure, you could play it with non-gamers to try to lure them into gaming, but there are more interesting games for that task.

RATING: 9.5
The pinnacle of tile laying pattern making area control. My Dad likes this, and we play the app all the time. I like it too as a solid dueling challenge. Our battles are always tense, even after not playing for a while. 
Rules are easy to pick up and recall, yet there is a great depth in strategy and room for high level plays.  On top of that, there is room for more players to make it more relaxed and randomised with more varied playstates.  It's a game for almost anyone I think.

As a wise man once said: "Just play Carcassonne" - you won't regret it.

RATING: 9
This was the game that got me into the board gaming hobby, and it's one of the few that remains now that I've sold off most of my collection.  It's simply a wonderful little game; quiet and calm, yet engaging and highly addictive.  The only real negative is that it takes several plays before a new player fully "gets" it.

RATING: 7
Bought the Big Box and recommend that approach to anyone wanting to get into Carcassonne.  The Big Box has all the important expansions and provides a good way of storing the whole game.

Best combination seems to be base set, inns & cathedrals, and traders.  However, my kids like the tower and the dragon/princess combo the best.

Less is more with this game.  Meaning, don't over do it with the all the expansions at once.  It makes for a very, very long game if you do it that way.

Less players is more too.  Too much down time if you have too many players.  Three  or four is max.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A superb game with loads of subtle strategies to keep track of, but won't induce headaches.  Probably one of the finest games to actually play so quickly; light yet not.  I highly recommend this as an introduction into European gaming for those not experienced with the current generation of board/card games.  Brief suggestion, though, invest in a small, opaque bag of some kind to store the tiles; mixing them up that way and drawing blindly saves the overly long set-up time of shuffling and places the tiles face down.

I'll rarely turn down a competitive game with Inns & Cathedrals. As a fun relaxing tile-layer, I'd rather play something like spades.

That being said, I've had some pretty intense 3p games, and the kids love it, and there's some great spacial elements and foresight trickery pays off.

This is probably in my top 10. Plus, the origin of meeple!

I would seldom suggest to play Carcassonne with a group of adults (although I am happy to play if another suggests it) -- it tends to be a little simplistic for my taste considering the length (especially if you play with expansions).  That said, I do think the game has an elegant simplicity to it.  I especially like it with Traders & Builders.  Where Carcassonne really shines for me is as an "adult" game that my son (age 5) can play.  It is really nice to be able to add a child to a game without impacting the enjoyment of the adults playing.

[b]Board Game Revolution - ~2005[/b] 
One of the first games my wife and I bought when we got married.  I still enjoy the puzzle like feel of building the city of Carcassonne.  Since then we've added most of the base game's expansions to our collection.  Easy game to teach and play with the kids.

[b]Expansions owned:[/b]
- [geekurl=/boardgameexpansion/2591/carcassonne-river][i]The River[/i][/geekurl] - [b]Board Game Revolution - ~2005[/b] 
I don't know if I'd consider this an "expansion" as it came with the base game.  But the added river through the countryside visually adds to the game and helps spread out all the players so we're not quite so congested.
- [geekurl=/boardgameexpansion/18836/carcassonne-river-ii][i]The River II[/i][/geekurl] - [b]Board Game Revolution - ~2007[/b] 
Starting out with an extra long river adds to the game.  We like to mix all the river tiles together.  I like to include the lake (end) in the bag so that we never know if we'll have a long river or a short one.  This house rule adds to the replay-ability of this expansion.
-------[b]Update 1/13/15: New idea for use of the river tiles[/b]
Start with all the tiles in the bag except one spring tile and the plain lake tile.  When/if the lake tile gets drawn.  The next player adds the spring (river starting) tile where applicable and continue drawing river tiles adding to the new river. At end cap off the river with the lake tile set aside.
- [geekurl=/boardgameexpansion/12903/count-carcassonne][i]The Count of Carcassonne[/i][/geekurl] - [b]Board Game Revolution - ~2008[/b] - Just don't think it adds too much to the game.  It's nice to share points with another player, but I'd rather work on expanding my own city/road/abbey.
- [geekurl=/boardgameexpansion/5405/carcassonne-expansion-2-traders-builders][i]Traders & Builders[/i][/geekurl] - [b]Board Game Revolution - ~2011[/b] 
The builder meeple adds A LOT to the game.  Being able to draw two tiles at a time is great!  Just be sure to not trap your builder into a city/road that cannot be expanded.  It is near impossible to get him back otherwise, unless you're playing with the dragon.  BUAH HA HA!  :)
- [geekurl=/boardgameexpansion/2993/carcassonne-expansion-1-inns-cathedrals][i]Inns & Cathedrals[/i][/geekurl] - [b]Board Game Revolution - ~2006[/b] 
I think the best addition this expansion adds to the game are the Inns allowing players to double the points of their roads from 1/tile to 2/tile.  The two cathedrals are nice to get early on in the game for bookoo points; but drawn later on in the game they become more of a nuisance. Great idea to "force" players to finish their bonus building/road, otherwise all that time was wasted and you don't get any points for any of those tiles.
- [geekurl=/boardgameexpansion/31784/carcassonne-abbey-mayor][i]Abbey & Mayor[/i][/geekurl] - [b]Board Game Revolution[/b] - [b]~2013[/b]
- [geekurl=/boardgameexpansion/35666/carcassonne-cult-siege-and-creativity][i]Cult, Siege and Creativity[/i][/geekurl] - [b]Board Game Revolution - ~2007[/b] 
It's an alright expansion.  My wife doesn't like being able to take points away from another, so this doesn't get played all that often.
- [geekurl=/boardgameexpansion/7707/carcassonne-king-scout][i]King & Scout[/i][/geekurl] - [b]Board Game Revolution - ~2007[/b] 
Couple of end of game bonuses for largest city/road.
- [geekurl=/boardgameexpansion/15158/carcassonne-princess-dragon][i]The Princess & the Dragon[/i][/geekurl] - [b]Board Game Revolution - ~2012[/b] 
This is by far our family's favorite expansion to the base game.  We all try to keep the dragon away from us, but love eating the other's meeples!  My youngest son will often eat his own meeples simply because he can.  We do, however, often forget to give the bonus point for the fairy, so we usually leave that part out.
- [geekurl=/boardgameexpansion/26615/carcassonne-mini-expansion][i]The Mini Expansion[/i][/geekurl] - [b]eBay - ~2007[/b] 
Bunch of new/unique tiles added to the game found in the Games Quarterly magazine, Issue #11 (2006).  I found this item on eBay.
- [geekurl=/boardgameexpansion/21385/carcassonne-tower][i]The Tower[/i][/geekurl] - [b]Board Game Revolution - ~2012[/b] 
At first I was skeptical about this expansion, but being able to take other player's meeples prisoner is awesome!  The only downside is when you are unable to capture the other person's meeple and do a prisoner exchange.  :(  But you can always award that player 3 points to get it back.  By the way, my family tends to gang up on me...something to do with me always winning. :D
- [geekurl=/boardgameexpansion/38855/carcassonne-catapult][i]Catapult[/i][/geekurl] - [b]Board Game Revolution - Christmas 2014[/b] 
The idea of this expansion is fun.  Does it really work? My kids think so!  They ask for it every time we play Carcassonne.  Me? Well, let's just say I understand why this microbadge exists [microbadge=11942].

I play a double set nearly every day at lunch with co-workers. Haven't got sick of it yet, and every day we figure out new ways to place tiles to enfuriate each other. An absolute blast--I've never played this with anyone who didn't subsequently go out and buy it for themselves.

What can I say. This tile laying game blew my mind. The feeling of seeing this township evolve just fascinates me. I`ve printed out and made tiles of everything on
the free carcassonne website. I could fill 2 ping pong
tables with tiles. Woods/Mountains/Seas/Lakes etc....
The two player game with a chess clock at 15 minutes per player is absolutly a blast. Some of the expansions have jumped the shark ,but hey there is so much to choose from to fit your own type of game style.

Very solid tile laying euro style game.  Great replayability.  Lots of expansions now out. Because each tile lay is important, and so much is going on with each tile lay, this is a thinker's game with lots of strategy angles to contemplate each turn.  The board grows freely outward, so there is a lot to examine and decipher each turn.  Most of my games seem to have players over thinking and therefore our games take a few hours to play.

EDIT: After playing it countless times on my iTouch, my love has rekindled. I am playing much more aggressive now and like it that way.
I have since removed all expansions from the base game and play only 'vanilla' carc.
My six year old daughter has begun playing it, too. We still leave out the farmers. She does well.

Good, flexible game. Can be vicious, especially with two players. Counting up points at the end is sort of a drag. The strategy is quite opaque to new players, and it takes many plays to become skillful. It also has a lot of downtime when many people are playing.

One of the first "complicated" games that i played, a game that lead me into the world where there is more than just Risk, Monopoly, Sorry...kinda sitting on the shelf lately, collecting dust but still one of my favorites games ever. Easy, fast (or long if you have tons of expansions for it), fun. Very nice intro game.

RATING: 7
A nice filler. Best to play with 2 or 3, more players makes it too random and less involving. Also a good gateway game to lure ppl into geekdom. True geeks will ask for more, while non-geeks will still easily enjoy it.

A great 2 or 3 person game. Infinite replayability. Classic. 
I get annoyed if we play more than 3 players. 
This may be one of those games where the main game is classic and the add-ons don't really add much value. 

	• This has turned out to be a great two person game with my 7yr old. Drop the farmer rule and it’s a good game for a youngster.

Obviously a classic and very good game. I much prefer it as a 3+ player game. I'd only rate it a 6 or 7 as a two player game. I am aware many like it as a two player game, it plays quite differently with two, I just prefer it with more involved.

One of the first games that i picked up to get my girlfriend to play more boardgames with me, and i can say that it has worked much better than expected. A very simple game that you can teach anyone but still with enough tactic to make it interesting for more hardcore boardgamers. I must say that this is a little gem and because om the short playtime it comes to the table quite often. At first my girlfriend was a bit sceptical of my pretty hard gaming style, screwing up her castles and such, but with time she grew fond of that style of play and now we have a real hard showdown every time we play. I can also add that this review is seen out of a 2 player perspective altough ive also played a few 3 player and 4 player games and really liked those aswell.

As one of the first games that my wife and I played in our reintroduction to boardgaming, Carcassonne will always have a special place in our hearts. Ostensibly I should be the one who is good with games that involve spatial relationships but my wife tends to squash me like a bug every time we play.

In spite of many others' comments, scoring in the most recent edition of the game seems to present little to no problem. Either people really hate farmers or some players are quite bad at math.

Probably my default game when no one expresses a preference.  The modular board means high replay value, the scoring mechanisms mean meaningful doses of both cooperation and competition, and the expansions make a game already bursting with variety even more so.

Ideal tile mix: Vanilla   I&C   T&B   to taste.

Looking back, this might be the easiest game with which to lure non-gamers.  While I still like to play, I find myself choosing more complex games now.  Still playing the base set and haven't worn out it's welcome.

Update: After receiving Inns and Cathedrals, this has become one of my wife's favorite games. However, she strongly prefers 2-player games.

A great, fast play game with much strategy. I had much success introducing this to my wargaming group, although I am laughed at everytime I use the word "meeple."  Follow-up: Too many expansions is both a plus and a minus in that it can add much needed complexity to the game, but at times can really slow it down. Sometimes I crave for just the base game. 07/10 Update: From my experience, Carc is best played with the River, Inns & Cathedrals, and Traders and Builders. Any more added in starts to push it for me.

A fantastic game for 2-5 players. The base game can last anywhere from 30-50 minutes depending on the size of the group.  Adding more expansions can increase the time required.

Pros:
+Simple to learn
+Requires no reading making it a game for the entire family
+Many expansions to mix and match to change the game to your preference

Cons:
-Requires a large play space
-The number of expansions can get costly and might scare away potential groups

This is the game that brought me back into boardgaming, and it will always have a place in my heart. Everyone loves playing with the meeples, and the game is a nice mix of strategy and tactics, improved with expansions. I also like that it plays up to 5, as a variable number of players is important to me. It's not perfect, as luck can really go a long way in determining the winner, but in my opinion it's the best gateway game - better than Catan or TtR.

I was pleasantly surprised at how much fun Carcassonne is to play.  It's a light, quick game that's fun to play with family.

Further plays have revealed to me that you can be a bit mean and try to sabotage your opponents efforts with strategic placement of your tiles.  Perhaps not always such a family friendly game after all! ;-)

It's still a great classic that is a perfect gateway game, but also is fun and quick enough to be enjoyed by more experienced gamers who want to play a light filler.

Components: Beautiful soft-edged art style. By the end of the game, we've formed a unique map that's fun to look at just for its own sake.

Experience: Matching up the tiles is a process I find deeply satisfying. There are fun scoring opportunities, chances to horn in on someone else's hard work (or prevent someone else from doing the same), and lots of meeple-management decisions to be made, to keep a steady stream of meeples cycling through my reserve to the board and back again. Controlling a dominant field (if one exists) can be crucial to success, depending on which scoring rules are being used.

I bought my base game and initial expansions on July 12, 2003 from Reader's Book Store ($54.12 with tax) and on July 18, 2003 from Dragon's Den in Grosvenor Park Mall ($22.59 with tax).  I'm not sure which expansions I bought initially, but the expansion dates indicate likely possibilities: The Expansion (aka Inns & Cathedrals), The River, and Traders and Builders.
We have played a lot of Carcassonne.  Annie doesn't like playing with farmers, in which case it evens out the playing field a lot.

I don't see myself getting tired of this anytime soon, especially after including expansions.

The expansions add to the game and make it that much more fun and random.

My first iOS game and my first "euro game" (don't like that term) so I have to give it a 7. Also because I've just played the base game and I do feel it has potential.

Quite a good game, novel at first but gets somewhat boring. It's quite fun ruining your opponents cities though.



I haven't played with any expansions yet. I'm hoping they revitalize it for me. Fingers crossed. :)

Only played this 2 player with my wife. Tried solitaire mode and didn't like it. I've played a couple of games vs AI. It's a solid game.

My favorite two-player game with wife. This game lacks strategic tension, but is instead calm and relaxing. With wife, that is the type of game experience I am looking for. We both love to try and steal into each others cities. We also both love the final few moves when we try to gain area control with farmers. We always play with Traders and Builders. It is the only expansion to any game that I see as an absolute MUST. Long-time keeper.

This was my original Most Overhyped Game award winner... then I played Balloon Cup.  Now as you can see from the 6 rating, I don't dislike Carc but it's not nearly as good as everyone led me to believe.  I love tile laying games but straight up vanilla Carc is a "nice" game - you draw a tile and then it's usually pretty obvious where to place it (or at least you can see what the obvious options are and then it's all hoping you get the right tile to match your choice).  Having a "hand" of two tiles added a little something for me but if you really want the good stuff just play Carc: Hunters and Gatherers (a much better game).

It seems like there is some depth to playing it really well, but there are so many other games that are more appealing to me right now that it might sit on the back burner.

Classic game but it's never entered my collection as I'm just not a big fan of Euro games.  However the game has good looking tiles, looks good on the table when the game is over, and classic wood meeples.  The game really is best with 2 players but honestly when I have one other person to play with there are just too many 2 player games I'd enjoy much more.

An excellent game that was my gateway into the world of Euro gaming. It contains a good balance of length, complexity, and accessibility. On the surface it appears that the game requires a fair amount of luck, but repeated plays reveal the strategic nuances that give skilled, experienced players the upper hand. I'm looking forward to purchasing the expansions.

Update: The "Inns and Cathedrals" and "Traders and Builders" expansions really complete this game. Though it requires extra outlay, I would consider them essential and with them the game is a 9 for sure.

For those with kids, my 4 year old loves to play this! While he doesn't play farmers, he likes to build the map and put the 'dudes' on the roads and cities.

Entertaining and very accessible game, but for me to play only as a filler game and even that not too often; plays well with different number of players; expansions are not necessary, but offer at least more tiles; after having played "Inns & Cathedrals" and "Traders & Builders" however it is hard to play without them; other expansions make the game a bit more complex, while it excels in simplicity; using the expansions combined is possible.

Carcassonne is great fun. What I really like about it is building up the landscape as the game progresses. This rating is for just the base game. As a stand-alone product I think that Hunters & Gatherers is a better chocie. However, with a few expansions (but not all of them, mind you) Carcassonne takes the cake. Then you can add +1 to this rating. I especially loved the dragon expansion.

Also, the default rule of drawing one tile and playing it makes the game too random.

While very simple to play, this game can be very difficult to master.  You are essentially building a puzzle, where you can create castles, roads, churches, and farms.  Place your marker to gain points of those areas, get them back if completed.

It is so simple just about everyone I know figured it out in about 3 minutes (including a 5 year old) and enjoyed it.

Unfortunately this game suffers the same flaw as card games; card/tile counting.  To actually compete in this game you need to remember how many of each tile exists, build yourself structures that are likely to get finished, and disrupt the building of opponents structures.  It is a real bummer to "walk yourself" into a "dead end" in this game.  

The other downside of this game is that luck takes a large part in the game play.  Each player pulls cards at random to complete their structures.  It is possible that you will simply pull the right tile and never get to finish your building/road/farm.  Now over an infinite number of trials this probability drops to zero, but that doesn't mean that you will ever get to finish your castle this game. :)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
The rules are fantastically simple to pick up or explain. Laying down the tiles is an aesthetic joy as the map is created. Though the randomness is inherent to the game, skill will prevail as the 'cheat-sheet' makes it relatively easy to calculate the probabilities of drawing a particular card - weighing up the likelihood of your farmer being connected to a contested field or of your ability to successfully block an opponent's city makes for some interesting decisions.

Ultimately about balancing immediate and eventual rewards, whilst trying to connect cities or farms in your favour, this seems like the ultimate family game - simple enough to explain, enough randomness to give everyone a chance, enough skill to reward playing well and fairly universal instant appeal.

Played with Joel 4x, since we both enjoyed it so much and it seemed a quick game.

-----------------------------------
2008-04-05
Against Dave and Barry, the game dragged on a lot more. I don't know if this was because of the over-analysis or because of the 3-player nature. 

Maybe just a case of improper game/group matching?

Still, I'm now a bit more cautious about how it'll perform with the family.

-------------------------
2010-01-03

Finally played with Family. Played 3x (5p,5p,7p). First 2 times, played without famers or crests. 3rd time, introduced the farmer rule.

Afs took long enough to get a complaint from everyone else. He also (correctly) decreed that only the farm mattered. Indeed, most of the map was a single farm and I won by having 4 farmers. 

Not sure if the single-big-farm was because we didn't play with the river tiles or because of chance.

Still a great game. Works fine with 7. (We used Go stones for dad/I).

It takes a tiled to build a village: What can I say it's, 'Carcassonne'. It plays good with any number and it is simple to learn. Children will enjoy the ever expanding landscape and can easily understand the concepts of the game. An excellent game to start out with to transition them from, Candyland to real games. I have played this game with scores of individuals and the only people that didn't seem to enjoy it were beer drinking, 'the cheaper the better', pretzel chewing, every sports game watching, reliving high school days type of people. I am sure they would have enjoyed chugging a beer and playing a sports type game. Highly Recommended.

The Farmer scoring is unneccesarily complex and is a big turn off for me on this one. 
UPDATE: 6.5 Now that I have played other games like Caylus, BlueMoonCity, and Mykerinos, the scoring fiddlyness of this game and poor art kinda bothers me. 
Update: 6. Farm overconnectedness really surpresses the rest of the game. (Corrected in hunters and gatherers)

This game is simple enough for me to play with my parents but strategic enough for me to play competitive games with my gaming group.  There is almost zero setup and clean up is almost as fast.  The way the board is made as players lay their tiles is so effortless and elegant.

Never much cared for this until the iPad version came out and I found it to be a bit more interesting than I thought, with some room for nasty play. Other than that, though, the decisions of the game just don't draw me in. I'm finding this with many tile laying games, so maybe it's the style of the game that doesn't appeal to me.

While I'm not a big fan, this is a classic and I do enjoy the occasional game.

This is a very good game and always one of the first I think of when I want to play a relaxing game with one or more members of my family. Sharp kids can pick this up fairly well below the age of 8, and once they hit that age you don't have to pull any punches playing against them. Greater starter game, and one of the best when playing for the social aspect as opposed to the competitive.

First euro game we bought. And we love it very easy to pick up can be played almost anywhere as long as its flat. My daughter picked it up from age 6 maybe the farmers aspect not grasped though. Is definanatly enhanced by inns and cathedrals and builders and traders. We also have the river, which was the original game start. I think you could get carried away with the expansions though and the game then take too long. A truly great euro game, and at the price a good one to treat non gamers to.

Carcassonne is just the best game. Fun, not too hard, some luck, some choice, a growing modular tile board, can be played competitively or cooperatively... it's just almost perfect. (Add Inns & Cathedrals and it's a 10.)

My GF and I's favorite on-the-go game. We NEVER play this at home and take this game with us where ever we go. The game is super simply to learn but there is a ton of tactial moves you can play throughout and the board is never the same twice so it really lends itself to a TON of plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Just not an engaging game. It's ok if you keep a hand of 3 tiles and draw one each turn to replace the one you used but even that's not enough to mitigate the silly luck aspect and boredom factor. Quite willing to trade this game for somethin else.

Look - Carc is amazing. The tactile feel of pulling and placing tiles is ace. The game scales nicely and rules are simple and intuitive. I love how the game can be played "mean" or "nice" depending on how competitive your group is. The expansions add flavor and clever rules that keep the base game fresh. Truly a modern classic.

Missing River Tiles.

- Still has depth to it
- Cheap
- Easy to set up
- still fun to play after 15 years (though I admittedly only play it very rarely anymore)

This was one of the first games I purchased after being introduced to the world of "Euro" games (Catan being the first).  I loved this game when I first played it, and immediately bought the Inns/Cathedrals and Traders/Builders expansions.  Although I haven't tried any other expansions, I really enjoy the set I have now.  I still love playing this game, and even though other games have kept this from hitting the table as much, it always gets good reviews after pulling it off the shelf.  I also love that it works well as a 2 player game.

Only played so far with two. And it is a great game for two--elegant, leisurely without dragging, involving just the right combination of strategy and luck. We sort the tiles into several piles, mixing the river tiles in with the rest, and then let them work their way to the top. Adds another difficult decision to the game.

Date approximative du texte: 2003

Lauréat du Spiel des Jahres 2001, un prix qui couronne plutôt des jeux grand public, Carcassonne est un jeu qui a rencontré un grand succès commercial. L’auteur et l’éditeur ont donc continué à exploiter ce remarquable filon en sortant des extensions pas toujours indispensables. D’autres jeux ont été commercialisés sous la bannière de Carcassonne et aujourd’hui le logo du jeu est quasiment une marque en soi.

Le jeu

Il se compose d’un jeu de 72 tuiles paysage. Ce sont des carrés où peuvent figurer des portions de ville, de route, de champs ou des abbayes.
Chaque joueur reçoit 8 pions d’une couleur.
Une tuile de départ (dos grisé) est posé au centre de la table.
A son tour un joueur doit piocher une tuile à l’aveuglette et la placer de façon à agrandir la cité. Il est nécessaire d’observer une cohérence dans la pose et de respecter les continuités des routes, des villes etc.…
Le joueur peut également s’il le désire poser un de ses partisans sur la tuile qu’il vient de poser. Le pion peut être posé soit sur la route, c’est alors un brigand, sur la ville, c’est alors un chevalier, sur une abbaye, c’est un moine et sur un champs c’est un paysan. Il est interdit de placer un pion sur une unité géographique qui en contient déjà un. Il est par contre tout à fait possible de réunir deux éléments distincts avec chacun un pion et d’obtenir un élément avec plus d’un pion ( par ex. réunir deux routes avec chacune un brigand par une autre tuile route).

En cours de partie il peut y avoir des attributions de point :
Dans tous les cas les points sont donnés au joueur qui a une majorité de pion sur l’élément géographique décompté. En cas d’égalité tous les joueurs majoritaires gagnent des points.
Si une ville est terminée (elle doit être complètement ceinturée de remparts) :2 points pour chaque tuile de la ville plus 2 points par blason. Une exception : une ville de deux tuiles ne rapporte que 2 points.
Si une route est terminée (elle est délimitée de chaque coté par un carrefour, ou une construction) :1 point pour chaque tuile de la route.
Lorsqu’une abbaye est complétée (quand la 8eme tuile qui l’entoure est posée), le joueur qui a posé un moine dessus gagne 9 points.
Quand une unité est achevée en cours de partie et qu’elle décomptée les joueurs récupèrent dans leur main les pions qu’ils y avaient placés.

Fin du jeu : quand la dernière tuile est posée.
Les paysans dans les champs : pour le ou les joueurs majoritaires, chaque ville terminée qui borde ou qui se trouve à l’intérieur du champs rapporte 3 points (et pas 4 comme indiqué dans la première version des règles). Un champs est délimité par le vide autour des tuiles, les routes, les villes.
Pour un abbaye : 9- le nombre de tuiles manquantes pour l’entourer complètement.
Route inachevée : 1 point/ tuile ( autant qu’une route achevée, ça sent le bug !)
Ville inachevée : 1 point/tuile

Variantes
La règle n’est pas vraiment jouable en l’état, heureusement elle se prête bien aux variantes, en voici quelques unes les plus indispensables en tête :

- Le jeu compte en réalité 71 tuiles, car il y a une tuile de départ. Pour que chaque joueur placent le même nombre de tuile, il faut retirer face visible 1 tuile à 2 joueurs, 2 tuiles à 3 joueurs, 3 tuiles à 4 joueurs, 4 tuiles à 5 joueurs.
- Les routes, les villes inachevées et les abbayes incomplètement entourées ne rapportent aucun point en fin de partie. Cela encourage les joueurs à entreprendre des constructions de taille réaliste.
- Le premier joueur ne tire pas une tuile mais deux, il en choisit une pour la placer et passe celle qui reste au prochain joueur qui en tirera une nouvelle. Ainsi chaque joueur à le choix entre deux tuiles.
- Interdiction de créer des zones vides entourées de tuiles.
- En début de partie chaque joueur reçoit une abbaye, puis toutes les tuiles sont distribuées de façon à ce que les joueurs aient connaissance de tout leur jeu.
- En début de partie chaque joueur reçoit une abbaye qui si elle est inachevée rapportera des points négatifs.

Mon opinion

Carcassonne est l’exemple même du jeu convivial, à la fois plaisant et intéressant. Les joueurs prennent des décisions sans sombrer dans la reflexionite aiguë qui plombe l’ambiance. Carcassonne à eu un succès mérité, le problème est de savoir si tout le monde joue bien au même jeu. Avec toutes les variantes qui circulent, je me suis aperçu que chacun se fait une opinion du jeu en se basant sur des règles différentes. C’est un peu ennuyeux d’expliquer les règles à chaque fois qu’il y a un nouveau joueur. Je regrette que l’éditeur n’ait pas proposé une aide de jeu reprenant la distribution numérique des différents types de tuile. Qui d’entre vous serai intéressé à jouer aux dominos sans les connaître ? L’évaluation des probabilités de sortie me semble indispensable pour avoir un peu de contrôle sur la partie.
Le jeu se positionne bien, avec une durée inférieure à une heure et il est courrant d’enchaîner deux ou trois parties à la suite. Il y a plein de moyens pour arriver à la victoire et il est possible de jouer aussi bien en père de famille (des petits scores en continu), en constructeur mégalo ou en saboteur sournois.
Le jeu du pion est une facette du jeu il autorise des tas de coups pendables si on anticipe une probable connections avec une construction lucrative jouée par vos adversaires. Il faut penser à toujours avoir un deux pions disponibles en main pour les bons coups mais ce n’est pas toujours facile de ménager sa main. Les paysans par exemple restent définitivement en jeu.
Carcassonne n’est donc pas un simple puzzle, c’est un jeu plein de surprises qui peut se jouer de nombreuses fois et ce avec tous les publics. Un bon choix dans la catégorie des poids moyens.

What I liked
* The game has few rules and is reasonably easy to teach
* The game plays fast and is easy to score
* While it plays slightly different it is still fun with any number of players.
* Game plays different each time
* Can play to be cruel or kind to the other players.

What I didn't like
* Fields seem a bit overpowered point wise compared to the roads and cities. Doesn't detract a great deal from the game though.
* Graphics are nice but I feel they could have been better.

It's hard to find a game as simple as Carcassonne that scales well at any player count, gives interesting choices, and never feels stressful or too luck based. That said, I can see why not everyone is exactly thrilled when it hits the table.

RATING: 7
If you own a Rio Grande edition, you should try the scoring for farms that the rest of the world uses (and to which most of the expansions are pegged) at: www.boardgamegeek.com/file/info/22897. That scoring makes more sense to me, although it does not really address the only issue I have with the game, namely, the dominance of the farm. It would take later versions, such as Hunters & Gatherers and the Castle, to deal with that.

[April 2017 - 8.5]
I'm still enamored by this game. 

[June 2016 - 8.2]
Another bump up in the ranking thanks to the expansions (Inns & Cathedrals and Traders & Builders), which add a little more interaction and thought about placement.

[October 2015 - 7.8]
Continues to be a winner when I introduce it to people. I really enjoy it with four people. 

[January 2015 - 7.6] 
I've been playing a little more and it gets a nudge up in the ratings. People really enjoy it, its wonderful to look at and it's fun. I reiterate though, that this needs to be the first or second game of the night, it can't come after a boisterous game, or else it falls flat. 

[August 2014 - 7.5]
Classic game and I enjoy playing it, but sometimes it's actually a tough one to bring out to the table with new players. The "fields" rule (which many times determines the winner) can take a full game to understand and sometimes the game can bog down. Tip: Flip your next tile over immediately after playing to contemplate your next move when your turn comes around. It's a game, I've come to discover, good to play as the first one of the evening, then ramp things up with something a bit more interactive and boisterous. If you do the reverse (eg. play The Resistance before Carcassonne), then it feels a bit dull. I still give it 7.5 though, because it's a GOOD game on its own and given the right time, I want to play it.

This game is pretty great and very addictive at first.  We have played it an untold number of times now and it is all anyone wants to play.  If you don't own it...get a copy, trust me.  However, I did lower my rating after a couple of years...just too much repetition I guess.

This game is fairly simple to play, which makes it great for the whole family.  We usually play it with 5 players, and it usually lasts 2 to 2.5 hours.  We play it with all the expansions that we own, and are adding more expansions every time one comes out.  I didn't rate this game higher because I tend to like more strategy driven games.  This game is definitely more relaxed.

I do still like an occasional 2 player game of Carcassonne. But since I don't have the desire to play i felt the need to lower my rating one point. Don't get me wrong, I still like Carcassonne but I just don't want to play it as often as I used to.

[First comment]
My favorite game on BSW. Can be played very competitive which is something I like. And I don´t agree with the people saying that there is too much luck involved in it as long as you play it with only two, max. three players.

RATING: 7
One of my first 'modern' games. I remember hunting around for a copy with the SO for several months trying to find a copy at a retail store (this was before we knew of the plethora of online shops).

Carcassone is a wonderfully simple tile-laying game. It can be as leisurely or as cutthroat as your group wants it to be. The rules are easy to teach and it's fun to watch the countryside unfold before you. The plethora of expansions available also kept the game fresh for a long time.

My only gripe with the game is that your decisions can sometimes feel a bit pre-destined since you only draw one tile. If that tile doesn't help any of your ongoing projects, it feels a bit like a wasted turn. Luckily, playing with a hand of 3 (or more) tiles fixes this problem for us and creates a larger decision space.

Carcasonne doesn't see a lot of table time anymore as we've moved on to more complex games (and we've played it to death), but it still holds a special place in my heart and it's one of the first things I'll pull out if anyone ever says "Boardgames? You mean like Monopoly?".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.75
Burned out on it years ago, but the enthusiasm it can stir among non-gamer friends isn't to be denied.  Just needs a clock or something; with this many tiles to lay, analysis paralysis on every move can really undermine the basic 'lightness' of the game.  Inns & Cathedrals is a must.

My number one played game of all time! I love that when you're first learning it, it's a peaceful "hey, look at this thing I built" kind of game. Then you start to play more aggressively and try to steal what others have built. Then you realize how much fun it is to place tiles in order to screw with other people. Great with 2, still pretty good with 3. I always play it with the first two expansions and have no desire to add any others.

A game i'm growing to like more and more.  The wife, who seems to really enjoy the game, and I play it quite often as a 2-player without expansions of any kind.  Will probably get some of them eventually to keep the interest level up.  Tried a variant where you maintain two visible tiles in front of you for each hand and select the one you want to play.  Makes for a more agonizing game as you can see what your opponent might be planning.

Just purchased this game (based on strength of word of mouth and the cool looking bits) looking for something to play with my inlaws and that could be packed up easily and taken on vacation.  I would call it a huge success in both areas.  I really enjoyed this game.  There's just something about a simple game that has a depth of strategy.  I've already begun considering picking up the expansion and we've played it only three times.

This is what I call simple, great game design and mechanics.

Not a game we bring out often, but always enjoyeable when people put themselves to it and play eithere with :

- Builders and Traders (I find it is a must now) and king expansions.
- No more than 5 people, even better with less

To reduce the amount of luck and significantly improve the strategy aspect of the game:

- Either with 3 tiles in hand or 4 open tiles (to all players)


I am always tempted to take a picture at the end of each game a build a playing library (but fnally found more useful things to do!)

Enjoyable light strategy game. Should be played aggressively.

I would suggest that when playing with expansions, of which there are many, that you limit things to the base game, 'The River', plus any one other expansion. More than that and the game drags on longer than it justifies and what was a nice lite strategy game becomes too bloated for it's structure.

I have actually played a lot of Carcassonne and used to enjoy it quite a bit, but the game was ruined for me one fateful day when one of my brothers asked me to play a "short" game with him.  He loves all things Carcassonne, and probably has about 5 copies of everything.  Everything.  Apparently a "short" game involves removing 1 or 2 copies.  The game lasted forever, yet he still complains about how long that one Zombies!!! game lasted.  You will have a difficult time convincing me to play.  I have been scarred.

This tile laying game seems fun at first, but gets tired very quickly.  While it's neat seeing the final product, building the castles and fields is pretty random and requires very little thought.  I'll admit to playing this alot when I first got it, but got rid of it a few months later.

A good game with surprising depth.  I consider this the best "gateway game," hands down.  Sadly, advanced play becomes a chess-like game of blocking and playing for scoring majorities that becomes tiresome and repetitive for my tastes.

This is another early game that I taught my girlfriend and one that remains as one of her favorites to this day. 

I went through a period where I was cool to this game. It seemed a little too random to be really interesting, and I was busy with investigating other games. Since then, my opinion of the game has improved quite a bit. 

At its core Carcassonne is an investment game. It isn't about investing in stocks, or countries, or railroads but about investing in particular landscape developments. Now, these investments may not pay off. You may end up failing to get the tiles you need to get the really high dividends. You must also manage your resources (actions and meepless both) in order to take true advantage of your existing investments without ignoring emergent possibilities. You have to watch out for hostile take-overs from other individuals who have decided they liked what you have built up and want to take it over.

So now I am quite fond of it, particularly with the various expansions both big (Traders & Builder plus Inns & Cathedral) and small (The River II; King & Scout; Cults, Creativity, Siege). It will never be a Top 10 game for me, but it is a game that has earned a definite place in my collection. 

Best with 2>3>Anything else

extremely simplistic. Good for a younger crowd. But strategy can make or break your success.

RATING: 8
Very clean and elegant tile laying game from Hans im Glueck. The city of Carcassonne is constructed by simply drawing a tile and positioning it on the ever increasing game "board". Players score points by playing their coloured pieces onto the played tile as a knight (in cities), farmers (on the green stuff), robbers (on roads) and clergyman (on monasteries). Points are maximised by enlarging the sphere of your piece. Timing is everything, as you only get your pieces back when you complete a sphere. Excellent game.

Variant: Put three tiles face up in the center for players to choose from on their turns, or they can take a random tile if they don't like any of those.

RATING: 8
Sure it seems like it's luck of the draw a lot of times. In fact, almost all the time. But the backstabbing antics combined with strategic placement for points somehow makes up for the very present luck factor. A good game, and now an app. Go figure.

RATING: 6.5
I have a fond spot for this game, since it was one of, if not the, first Eurogame I ever played, and helped introduce me to the world of board games, boardgamegeek, and Meeples!  I like Hunters and Gatherers a bit better, but they are very similar. There is always discussion about confusion over the farming rules, I didn't mind them myself but I did find it caused some confusion when teaching the game.

Update: I got this for my iPod, and playing it after having played Hunters and Gatherers more lately, the original just hasn't held up as well in comparison.  A friend of mine has borrowed my copy for a long time so I think I'll just let her keep it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.75
Good game. The farmer mechanic can lead to an unbalanced game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.4
A simple game with some subtle strategy but still dependent on the luck of the draw. Knowing the probability of getting the tiles you need is useful, but I don't usually worry about it. I just enjoy building the map because it looks cool. I just wish the cities with only two tiles looked a little more natural. I was surprised that my wife doesn't like this game. The gameplay just doesn't appeal to her. There is a house rule of having a hand of 2 or 3 tiles instead of just drawing and immediately playing each tile. I haven't tried this rule yet, but I think it could really up the strategy level. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.2
Good solid game, and an excellent addition to the collection. The rules are a little light and the scoring is kind of abstract until you get a couple of plays in, but this is a great filler on marathon board game nights OR a good single selection for quick games.

[b]OPINIÓN PERSONAL:[/b]
El padre de todos los juegos de colocación de losetas, estupendo para iniciar a alguien en los juegos de mesa (aunque para la primera partida recomiendo encarecidamente hacerle caso a las instrucciones y jugar SIN granjeros).

Es un juego que a primera vista parece no tener casi interacción entre jugadores, pero según vas jugando te das cuenta de que (aun sin ser su fuerte) sí que hay "puteo"... y es que no hay nada como ir ampliando una y otra vez la ciudad del rival para que nunca llegue a terminarla, o quitarle una gran urbe/camino colocando estratégicamente a tus meeples. Se podría decir que la interacción es un poco sutil, pero desde luego es un punto clave para alzarte con la victoria (un jugador que nunca fastidie a su rival no tiene nada que hacer contra un oponente más "agresivo").

En cuanto al azar, está claro que tiene un peso importante, pero los grandes jugadores pueden llegar a controlarlo (memorizando cuántas losetas hay de cada tipo y calculando cuántas quedan por salir/qué probabilidad hay de que salga una en concreto). Si no tienes una mente superdotada, siempre puedes añadir alguna regla casera para limitar un poco el azar (como la de tener una mano de dos losetas, y que en tu turno robes una y elijas cual echar de entre las tres)... aunque personalmente creo que para este juego concreto, el azar (y saber cómo adaptarte a él) es uno de sus encantos. Y eso que a mí no suele gustarme nada el azar.

No recomiendo comprar demasiadas expansiones, pues me parece que solo complican (innecesariamente) el juego con miles y miles de pequeñas reglas, pero si se hace quizás sea recomendable quitar unas cuantas losetas antes de empezar a jugar para que la partida no se alargue demasiado (cada ampliación suele añadir unas cuantas losetas, y la partida no se termina hasta que se colocan todas).

One of the games, that you can play with almost everyone, and almost everyone will enjoy the game. I especially like the aesthetics of the game, the slowly growing and meandering landscape. It's somehow hypnotizing. The level of thinking involved is also nice, not too hard, not too easy. The sweet spot. However, this game can be quite vicious, when played aggressively, and some people might get frustrated, or even run crying in their room, just to reappear after 10 min with a hand-crafted piece of exactly the missing shape to fit in their enormous giant caste and filling up the last spot on their monastery ;)

I was introduced to the world of board gaming with this game.  I fell in love with Carcassonne then and still leap at every chance to play it.  It's quick, strategic, fun, and every game is a little different. Just the look of the board as it grows tile by tile is intriguing.  Though my favorite game may now be far more "hard core", I play this one more often then any other I own.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
There's little that can be said that hasn't been said a thousand times already, but in any case: 

Carcassonne is a simple, elegant, preeminent example of a German family game. It can be played friendly, or incredibly cutthroat. The game rewards skill to a great degree; there's no need for a hand of tiles. Such a variant is for people who haven't realized the power of blocking and stealing.

The game also works surprisingly well with 2 and greater player counts. The ability to share features becomes something to watch out for and help with or hurt.

The expansions add interest, too. There's certainly enough there to interest both a new and experienced player. Carcassonne is well worth your time, if you haven't yet played it.

I'm constantly surprised bu how many people dismiss this game.  The core game itself is one of the best tile laying games out there.

Obviously, expansions just make counting more difficult. Certainly popular with the masses but underrated by hardcore gamers...shame

Don't let the "cute and cuddly" facade throw you - this is a very cutthroat game when played properly. Plus you get to make a pretty picture while you're playing! Awwww...

YES!!! Draw a tile, play a tile, play a meeple if you got one. That's it, that's all the rules (well... for the base game at least). This game is great fun to play and easy to teach to newcomers. Many expansions are available and, depending whom you play with, the games can be brutal, cutthroat, strategic games or simply a fun, city-building competition. What's a meeple you ask... get this game and find out!

While I'd never break it out with the main group, this is an easy choice if I've got anyone fresh to gaming. Turns are simple, strategy is clear, and a lot of luck on the tile draw to even out chances of victory.

New players tend to really appreciate the end result, looking at the map that has been created as a result of the competition. Pick up the Tower expansion for extra gimmicky fun (I can't help it, the tile-draw tower looks great.)

RATING: 8
The classic game that popularized tile-laying.  There are a lot of factors involved in winning the game: there is the luck of drawing the right tile you need, there is strategy of seeing the best option amongst many on the board; there is also a push-your-luck aspect when you decide if you should finish off a castle or keep going.  Very experienced players may often have an advantage as they’ve already seen all the possible tiles that exist and can even judge the probability of drawing the one they need.  However luck is still a mitigating factor to keep new players involved and usually scores are always very close amongst all players.  
The only cons I can think of is that the scoring session at the end is can be a bit involved, and scoring for the farmers in particular can be a bit of a pain.  There can also be a bit of downtime between turns when playing with five or six players (expansion for sixth player sold separately) especially with players prone to Analysis Paralysis.   The popular house-rule of drawing a tile for your next turn at the end of your current turn is recommended for faster play.   
Overall, this game holds up very well over the years and makes an excellent gateway game.

RATING: 8
A superb game at its best with two or three players (more tiles each means a more even 'distribution' of luck). With more than three it is still intense but I feel it becomes more of a lottery - ie bad luck can hurt you a lot. However, its fun with any number.

Simple and fairly luck-driven game, that is usually interesting in a puzzle-like way.  It is hard to know how much effect strategy has, or maybe it just has too much scoring at the end (farm scoring is too opaque).  The downtime between turns makes it not so good for a large number of players—-but it is usually when you have a lot of players that you want to play something this simple.

We found this to be a very enjoyable map building exercise. heh

The game moves briskly with not too much in the way of brain lock.  There are many paths to victory, and it isn't always certain that the same path will work from one game to the next.  Nice, that.

Laying the tiles is fun, running out of meeple workers is not. *grumble*  But therein lies the challenge.  Spend your meeples and plan your tile placements well (AND sprinkle in a bit of luck), you'll emerge the victor.

Easy game to run off two or so in an evening if the motivation is right.

People say this game has too much luck. After playing it many, many times online and in person, I have to disagree. It's no chess or go, but you definitely need to think and plan. Should I build alone? Should I horn in on another person's city or road? I drew a bad tile, what should I do? 

There is so much tension and so many decision that I think the best players are the ones who can be flexible.

Carcassonne is a good tile placement game. Enjoyable for the whole family. Excellent game for non-gamers.

Carcassonne is easy to learn. Any non-gamer would enjoy Carcassonne. I rarely play this game now a days though I still collect the new expansions when they come out. The expansions are not too expensive and I guess I want my copy of each expansion before they are OOP.

Build cities and road! I enjoy Carcassonne with some of its expansions.

They say some people have difficulty calculating the prairies. I don't see what is so hard to understand, seems quite forward to me.

Update: Trade a few newer expansions.

Tile placement is the greatest game mechanic ever. The rules can be explained in two minutes and is short enough to keep everyones attention. The dozens of expansions give this game a huge replay value. Use expansions with care though.

Fair.  A good light family game.  Bottoms out at high skill levels due to the need to either memorize tile distributions or play with silly cheat sheets.  A good house rule is to just remove unseen a certain number of tiles.

It grows on you like mold.  Slow, fuzzy, and not too offensive smelling.  In fact, for some reason, you keep coming back to smell it.  It actually smells pretty good.  Wait, did I say mold?  I meant moss.  Moss!

The awesome part about this game is that it lets you think with your eyes.  With most Euros I'm crunching numbers in my head and trying to figure out what the other players want to do.  With Carcassonne, I'm visualizing what shape the board can potentially take, and the position of your opponents' pieces flat out tell you what they're thinking.  There's no hidden information here, the board is easy to look at, the scoring options are very straight forward, and they're nicely tied to the layout of the board.  Looking at the board tells you everything you need to know in order to make good decisions.  

This game is really about visualizing what shape you want the board to take and working your darndest to make it happen.  The catch is that everyone else at the table has a vision for the board as well and their visions probably don't match yours.  Fantastic game!

I prefer this as a "gateway game" over Catan, which can sometimes feel unfair or frustrating when the dice don't go your way or you only draw rubbish from the resource deck. Tile-laying is also one of my favorite things to do in games, and this has one of the most elegant systems based around tiles. Not always super interactive, but I think it usually feels competitive in a way that keeps things going. There are a lot of expansions although I rarely bother with them.

Carcassonne was my gateway game, responsible for getting myself, my wife and other members of the family into boardgaming.  We were so excited when we found this game and still love to play it.  I really like that there is no real setup involved and that the landscape takes shape as you play the game, and there's nothing quite like taking over someone else's city or farm.  I've taught this game to friends, family and workmates and everyone seems to love it.

RATING: 7
An enjoyable game for two, with more there's too much downtime for the content involved. It's a lot of fun to build the land with tiles and the scoring can get pretty competitive when land types merge with opposing players involved. I believe this game is ruined by expansions - I picked up too many and lost my love of the game, sold them all away.

30-60m, 2-4 players. 10+ plays.

The farmer scoring is a little tricky and I found a couple of rules that seem to be open to interpretation, but we have a lot of fun.  It is one of those rare games that is challenging for adults without being too difficult for kids.  Don't get more than a couple of cities with your knights going at any given time or you'll end up with a bunch of unfinished cities at the end of the game.

RATING: 8
UPDATE: We rarely play this but I think it’s still a good game once you get over the “which version of the city/farmer rules are we using” issue. Get this, get Inns and Cathedrals, then stop.

I think this is still one of the best light games out there. It hits that sweet spot that there is just enough strategy that you can play it as a really light "passing the time" game or as a deeper one (but not too deep). We usually play with a hand of two tiles (play one, then draw) which allows for a more flexible game.

RATING: 10
This is one of the few games that simultaneously offers interesting strategy and ease of learning. The mechanics are fairly simple, and can be taught to anyone in about 5-10 minutes, with similarly quick setup and take down times. Game play is fairly fast, and the way the board is constructed greatly increases replay value. 

It scales well too, which comes in handy when you are bringing games for a group and don't know in advance how many people you will have. It is good as an entry game, which is useful to have if your group likes to recruit people who pass by and express interest. 

The only downside is that it does need a fairly large table, which can sometimes be hard to find if you play in stores or coffee shops.

Carcassonne is the epitome of a gateway experience.  You simply draw a tile and choose a legal location to place it.  After that you can lay a meeple on one of the tiles features for scoring possibilities.  Opponents may try to force there way into your scoring opportunities and then points are given based on majority.  The game works and is alright but I think I would rather play other gateway games like Pandemic or some easy card games with non-gamers.

Edit: This game has been replaced for me by Isle of Skye.

Digital Alert:

I've recently started playing this through iOS and played that way I would rate it an 7 as the benefit of a digital format is the enforced rules, it has a nice tutorial, and the randomization of tiles is done by the computer.  In addition the game is played much faster.  I think playing the physical copy of the game would result in a 5 rating.  So my 6 rating is an average of digital and physical.

Love this game, the wife loves it, it is loved.  Definitely play with a 2 or 3 card hand variation.  Also, instead of "draw a tile and play it" draw a new tile at the end of the turn, so you can think about your next move while everyone else is going.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A good starting place for newer games. Simple rules with enough decisions to keep at least new people interested. I like the fact that you can block other players if you want to.

Feeling however is a bit bland and the game gets a bit boring after a while and therefore I nowadays prefer Hunter&Gatherers as the one box Carcassonne-solution. The other option is to use expansions with the original.

We play this game so often that I've given up recording plays for it. It's Steve's absolute favorite. He beat me pretty badly in the first few games, but then he gave away some of his "tips" and I got better, so we're pretty evenly matched now. He said that's the last time he ever gives me advice about games. But it hasn't diminshed his enjoyment apparently... this is still the game he picks almost every time.

I loves me some tile-laying action. Carcassonne was one of my first designer game purchases and I still treasure it. However, even my completist nature can't convince me to buy the Tower and the Catapult expansions, let alone Cult/Creativity. I considered the Princess and Dragon expansion to be borderline, and I only have it mixed in with my base game for the extra tiles.

RATING: 8
The most played game in our collection in 2014. Great interesting fun as a new map emerges each time.  Challenges our logic and creativity to blend land use planning and economic value. No two maps are the same.  Ever fascinating game play. Great two player experience every time.

Fun, despite its flaws. Random tile-drawing doesn't dilute the fun of tile placement, and the vast differences from game to game. The replayability and probably-infinite scaleability (in terms of numbers of players and expansions) make this one especially good as a bridge game.

Wonderful gateway game with a decent amount of player interaction and relatively low downtime. The game also has the ability to adapt to different crowds, which has given it very long legs in my collection. It can be played nicely, with each player working on their own features, or played brutally, with players competing to steal large features. The expansions tend make the game a little too long at times, but also manage to keep it fresh.

Some people have complained about randomness in this game, but I don't care.  The game doesn't last long enough (usually less than an hour) for it to really matter.  It's fun to draw a tile, and figure out the best placement.  There's more strategy to this game than you may initially think; players tend to overlook the ability to frustrate another player's game, and automatically play a tile in the best possible position for themselves.  The game definitely improves with expansions, although each one adds to the playing time.

Elegant in its simplicity, this game is very quick and easy to grasp making it perfect for family and rainy-day parties.  Not exactly a filler game as a good round, especially with expansions added can take a while, but not a brain-burner by any means.  Tile-based, it is infinitely replayable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Solid. Grows a little more on me every time I play it. Five players is a little annoying though. 

After a lot of plays, the game just hits a plateu. It's initial virtues of being a simple, straightforward game is eventually its downfall. I have no interest in getting anymore expansions to prolong its life (only expansion I own is scout and king)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Carcassonne is a great filler game before something a little heavier. It allows players to talk while they play easily. It encourages players to help others figure out where and how to place tiles. Great Euro game that every gamer should own! Also a great gateway game! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
After lots of (mostly 2 player) sessions, though even playing with some expansions, I kind of lost interest in the game. Can't exactly say why, maybe it's the lack of theme, and the rather dull placing of the small tiles in the best spot possible just doesn't give me the kicks at the moment.

[more than 4 plays] Beautiful game, and of course I love my meeple troupe, the Flying Wallendas.  I like original Carcassonne (actually, have played with and without the River expansion, and don't really have a strong feeling about it), though the farmer scoring (which I hear has changed in later editions?) is annoying.  I would like to try more of the expansions and variants.

This is a really lovely game. First, minimal set up time. Second, the bits are of good quality and the meeples are iconic. Third, the game play is satisfying and really shines as a cut-throat two player game. Fourth, the time to play is the same for any number of players. I suggest you invest in some expansion right away, you'll probably only use the base game as an introduction for new players. After that you'll be looking for more variety and depth very soon after. 

Includes I&C, T&B, Phantom, and Mini Expansion #1

Love Carcassonne and can play 4 or 5 games in a row.  We usually always add an expansion or two since each expansion changes your strategy.  But sometimes we will play with just the base game for a quick 10 minute game.  Each expansion adds its own uniqueness to the game and causes you to alter your plan accordingly.  

*Note: I would rate just the base game with no expansions an 8, but with the ability to change the game each time it is played it is a perfect game that does not take too long to play.

I would rank the expansions as follows:
1. Inns & Cathedras
2. Traders & Builers
3. The Tower
4. Abbey & Mayor
5. Wheel of Fortune
6. Princess & Dragon
7. Castles, Bridges & Bazaars

I would rank the mini-expansions as follows:
1. Phantom
2. Plague
3. Festival
4. Tunnels
5. River II
6. Die Schule
7. Crop Circles
8. Count
9. Cult, Siege and Creativity
10. River I
11. Mini-Expansion
12. King & Scout

Juego facilito, apto para todos los públicos.
Cuenta con diversas expansiones que aunmentan las gracias del juego pero que lo pueden hacer muy largo si jugamos con todas las piezas. La expansión río es de las más importantes para que las granjas no sean tan decisivas. Pero el rollo del dragón es de lo mejorcito.
Construye cosas rápidas para poder recuperar a tus hombrecitos y al mismo tiempo intenta cerrar una gran ciudad; los monasterios son puntos seguros y las granjas.... en las granjas está la clave, pero si te sale mal puedes perder la partida por tener a los muñequitas en las granjas y sin producir en otro lado. De las cosas más divertidas es intentar robar ciudades o caminos largos a otros jugadores.

(As of [b]11+[/b] plays) The classic tile-laying game. The concept and basic rules are easy to explain, while the strategy involved can be picked up relatively quickly by new players. The [GAMEID=2993] expansion is not necessary, but rounds things out nicely. Another game that, while no longer at the front of my play queue, will always have a place in my collection.

Simply lacking in tension.  Trying to figure out the farmer scoring seems to be the only really lively part of the game.  It is a nice game for children and people who don't otherwise enjoy games but like to draw tiles.

Maybe I'll try the three-tile draw variant.  Bumped up the score because my niece and nephew were delighted by it.  Truly, games with wide appeal get there for a reason - there is something about the play and art that really excites a variety of people..

I haven't played with the expansions, only the original game. Carcassonne is rather simple, but that doesn't mean it suffers from a lack of fun. One of the best features is its ability to scale from 2-5 with no drop-off in quality. If you memorize all of the tiles it can become an exercise in odds-drawing, but it works just as well as a casual (if cutthroat) tile placement game.

Having since played it in person, it feels like a very average game. Had no desire at all to return to the app. Uninstalled.

-------------Original rating 25/03/16 Score:6
[b]Rating based on - 25+ plays, 1 player vs AI and 2 player Android app[/b]
I avoided this game for a long time because it is popular and a household name. I don't usually go for the mainstream and in fact (after now owning more than 100 games) I am only just getting to what are the major 'gateway' games. In addition, looking at how the game played 'draw one tile, place that tile' it seemed quite limited and not very strategic. How can you make a long term decision with drawing just one tile? Where is the strategy in that? Would it not be better to have 2 tiles in hand and choose one? How do you mitigate bad tile draws? Are you not then at the mercy of the game?

Many, many months ago I got this as the Amazon free app of the day and still had not played it until recently. Since tile placement is my favourite game mechanism I decided it was finally worth a try. I was pleasantly surprised. It's more fun than I thought it would be. Although, how much of that is the cute graphical interface and how much of it is 'new game haze' I'm not sure. The game is OK. Sometimes tile draws are crap. A lot of the time the other person gets what you need. I'm not looking to rush out and get a copy any time soon but it's kind of addictive. The app finds matches for you to play and playing against humans instead of the AI is a real eye opener. It's interesting to see how some people play this game. Even when they can score for themselves they are looking to screw you over :D I like the fact that it's just a faceless person you game with. I see no need for 'chat' options in games. I am not looking to make new online friends. I'm looking to play games and have fun!

Great gateway game with enough complexity and strategic options to keep us replaying this one. We play a variant (keep a tile in hand, and each turn Play, Draw) in our group to speed up the play.

This game is great even without expansions (though I have most of the main ones).

I also play this with my children and we enjoy helping each other to build the cities and roads

This is another go-to game that is light but also provides opportunity for strategy. It's great for a quick game and especially for new players or players who cant take in a lot of rules or before mentally checking out before the game even begins. Each player draws tiles and the anticipation of the draw is what makes the game fun. It's a fantastic feeling of accomplishment when you finally draw that one piece you've been waiting for the whole game and you circle the point board twice because of the massive area you just finished. Points go fast in this game and a player who is far behind may suddenly catch up and pass the player after a single tile draw that changes the game. Great time for anyone

An excellent tile-laying game, children also enjoy the game play and medieval theme immensely.  2001 SDJ winner.  Best with just two players.  House-rule of having three tiles in hand is worth considering when playing with more than two players, to make the game more strategic and less dependent on luck-of-the-draw.  At the very least, draw your tile after your turn, so that players can plan their move and avoid downtime.  

Recommended: play with [url=http://www.riograndegames.com/uploads/Game/Game_48_gameRules.pdf]third edition rules[/url], where scoring is more consistent:
- 2 tile cities are worth 4 points (i.e. all cities and pennants score 2 points per tile)
- farmers scoring works by scoring each field, not each city (i.e. calculate which farmers control a field, and then that field scores 3 points per completed city touching that field)
These 3rd Edition rules score fields just like all other features: (a) points go to the players with the most followers in the feature; (b) remove followers, score next.  
See [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/319545]here[/url] for discussion on 1st vs 3rd edition rules.

Expansions I own:
[gameid=2993] - Unlike the other Carcassonne expansions, this doesn't change the game as dramatically, and makes it work better with up to six players.  Inns: increase point scoring opportunities; Cathedrals: can make for massive point-swing cities, not sure how good they are; Large follower: having an 8th meeple is good, but one worth 2x can make the game more vicious because when you sneak in a field or city you don't just share points but can actually steal them. 
[gameid=7707] - Mini-expansion, worth trying, the seven "King" tiles are for regular Carcassonne.  King/Robber: fiddly for point scoring and too big swings when playing with expansions; Extra tiles: good.
[gameid=12903] - Small expansion which gives the game an interesting twist.
[gameid=2591] - Came as part of my Carcassonne game.  Starting with the River tiles gives a good, broad starting area with more choices, and helps break up fields. (note: the farm goes around the spring, as discussed [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/383180]here[/url]).
Have also upgraded the meeples with Spielbox stickers.

Did not enjoy the tile drawing puzzle elements at all, the scoring even less so; adding in expansions just made it worse. Not my game at all regardless of blood alcohol levels.

The only fun I had with this was deliberately trying to bump on of my friends scores with each play to completely frustrate some "Carca-whore" who started douching at the table about his genius-like knowledge of this drek. He almost started crying when he realized that everyone at the table started piling on just to guarantee we'ed never be asked to play it or him again.

A truly enjoyable game in which you expand the board with tiles, scoring points based upon how the tiles connect and how you develop them with your limited pool of citizens and structures.

Great modern classic. Everyone should own this game.  So sad it's  not in the top 100 anymore.  I would recommend anyone who hasn't played this game in a while to pull it back out.  I know the base game is seems pretty bland, but that's why the game shines after multiple plays.  I personally think it scales well from 2-5 players, and I've even had good plays with my 4 year old son (just without farmers).  So it's simple enough for younger players, but that leaves plenty of room for some serious cutthroat play for more experienced players.  I haven't tried any of the expansions yet but have been definitely interested in getting a few of them.

good game, but with all of the expansions,  it is a Very good game. UPDATE: with so many expansions now, I must qualify this. Vanilla Carc. is an excellent 2 player game. I also enjoy playing with Inns & Cathedrals, Traders & Builders, and King & Scout. The other expansions have their place, especially in multiplayer games, but I think they detract more than add to the general feel and gameplay.

This was way too much fun.  I wanted to play it every time anyone came over, but my friends were hesitant at first.  Once I got them playing they had fun, but didn't embrace it as much as I did.  There is some luck involved in the tile turning, but it doesn't hurt the game over all.  Plus, there is a lot of great opportunity for screwing your neighbor, which is always fun.

I liked it. Easy to play and learn, is a good game even for non gamers. At first you can play it "just for fun" and with little practice you can apply strategy to your play, making it even better, just like domino.

RATING: 7
Despite being simple, has some good challenges with thinking about probable map completion, chances to block other players.  Marred by having a high degree of randomness (e.g. no hand to work with, but just a draw each time).  Open discussion of each tile is a mixed blessing, keeping weaker players in the game, but sometimes equalizing the game within the margin of randomness.

A great game with some odd scoring rules that cause confusion.  It often locks new players (or 1-2 random players when playing with 5 or 6) out of participating in many of the more interesting parts of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One of the most noteworthy aspects of this game is that since there is no resources saved between the turns, there cannot be a lot of thinking of what to do next - it is all decided by what tile is drawn. This limits the amount of strategy that can be employed, but it also has a very positive effect - you can sit back and enjoy your beer while the other players take their turns!

Eh... I don't see what the fuss is about. I've mainly played two-player with my nine year old. Easy enough for him to learn. Scoring farms was a bit unclear our first time through, but we figured it out. Overall, the game is pleasant enough, but I wouldn't call it terribly compelling. A bit surprising considering how popular this game seems to be.

RATING: 9
Egyszerű szabályok (túl sok kiegészítővel már azért nem annyira), hihetetlen interaktivitás, szórakoztató játékmenet. Nagy előnye, hogy két fővel, illetve max. fővel is játszható, de ez esetben azért számítani lehet a hosszabb holtidőre. Tökéletes családi játék, illetve tökéletes játék arra, hogy a nem társasjátékozó ismerőseinknek bemutassuk ezt a világot! Az első két kiegészítőt mindenképpen érdemes beszerezni, mert nagyon sokat adnak hozzá a játékélményhez! De túlzásokba nem érdemes esni a kiegészítőket illetően, mert mind összetettség, mind játékidő szempontjából nagyon meg tudja nyújtani a játékot. Bár az utóbbi időben háttérbe szorult a sok újabb játékunk miatt, de azért elő-elő kerül időként.

I used to enjoy this game more. The multitude of expansions has diluted the fun for me (especially when I was trying to collect them too). My wife doesn't really enjoy this one so we don't play it much any more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Based on 23 plays.
+ By the end of the game, the players have created a beautiful map.
+ Easily accessible.
+ Low price.
> I'm not interested in the expansions out there. I feel that playing with more than one expansion increases the playing time significantly, while not adding much to gameplay.
- Not as balanced as I was hoping for -- it seems that playing followers on roads is inferior to playing them on cities or fields. (A quick fix might work: each road tile is worth 2 points except the ends?)

[2014 July 06; 21 plays; 7/10]
I think this game plays best with 2 players, but will typically look for a different game if there are more than that.

Most plays have been 2-player games with my girlfriend. She loves the simple strategy and how well it balances the skill gap, but she really doesn't like us to be cutthroat; this puts us both in an awkward position of trying to figure out how the other will take our more aggressive tiles.

Regardless, even playing with others where I can play freely, I've just played this game too much since I got it (February, 2014). I'm bored of it.

A mi familia le gusta bastante, aunque prefieren Catán. Quizás sea extremadamente aleatorio y esto le quita en parte componente estrategico, pero al fin y al cabo también aumenta la rejugabilidad (ya sabéis, las gallinas que entran por las que salen).

One of the best games ever played.

* Enjoyed by people that have never played board games before as well as veterans.
* Good for families with kids 6+ years old.
* Easy to teach.
* Open to house rules to make it easier or harder (like no farmers, less/more workers to use etc).
* Tons of expansions (with the first one pushing the game to 10/10 for me, the rest are up to personal preference).
* Fine art (i enjoy the reprint a lot).
* Cheap game and very cheap expansions.
* Huge replayability.

Lost one point because i think the game goes to 10/10 with some expansions : river for a better start and inns&cathedrals for some tile diversity even if you don't use the additional rules.

[b]Best w/ 2[/b], ok w/ 3, not so keen on more

With competitive players, too much of game hinges on "Will I draw the tile I need to connect me up or will you draw the one that closes me out first?".

Play almost daily on Asobrain:

Me vs. 1 bot
Inns & Cathedrals
Traders & Builders

Try to break 300 points (do it maybe 1 or 2 in 10 games).

Games played like that take me about 10 minutes, playing against even one other human player takes 40 minutes.

Can be cutthroat or just a nice relaxing game depending on how you play it. I enjoy the map that is created at the end of each game. There are interesting risks to take depending on where you place your meeples, and you need to be sure you actually complete some of them so you can reuse them for more scoring opportunities.

Worth noting, this is the first game to get my wife interested in the hobby!

I really need to do a Carcassonne review soon, since I've passed the double dime mark. I just feel like a) it's superfluous with the sheer amount of content for Carc and b) most of my plays are with 2 players, so I don't get much exposure to the multiplayer aspect of it.

This is probably Dawn's favorite game, though, and if I ask her what she wants to play, 9 times out of 10 we'll end up playing Carcassonne.

Played with 4. 
Used Rivers Expansion.

One of the easiest games to introduce new players to.  I would explain the basics of scoring but not get too long in explaining as the games end fairly quickly.  After a game or two most people will understand the scoring and city mechanics.  The game is played by laying down tiles and placing meeples on different parts of said tile to create roads, cities, monasteries and other scoring areas on the board.  

I enjoy this game a lot more than Settlers of Catan if only because you do not have the resource trading that can agitate players, nor do you have the streak of really bad rolls or unlucky pick order.  I would score it an 8 if you are playing with the "competition" rule of drawing 3 tiles initially and redrawing one after each tile played.

This is a nice game. Many argue that having only one tile to play makes the game very luck-dependant. However, there are so many possible places where to place the tile, that luck is really not an issue.

An excellent short game that is just the right blend of luck, strategy, and opportunism, Carcassonne works best when you want to kill half an hour to forty-five minutes with a friend or two.  Involves just enough planning to keep you thinking, but is simple enough that you never feel intimidated or stressed while playing; I've avoided expansions (for the time being) specifically because the simplicity is integral to the enjoyment my friends and I get out of this game.  One of my personal favorite lighter fare games.

RATING: 6
* Played 50+ times. GREAT "GATEWAY" GAME! "Non-gamers" really like this. It's simple (draw a tile, and decide whether or not to put a follower on one of the tiles). I think that Carcassonne Hunters & Gatherers (a standalone sequel) is a better game than Carcassonne by itself, but the expansions for Carcassonne are so good (Inns & Cathedrals should be standard with this game; Traders & Builders is a fun way to mix it up; Princess & Dragon adds more randomness but is a lot of fun with more players and families...) So if you only play 2-players, you might want Carassonne the City; if you will never buy any expansions, you might want Carcassonne Hunters & Gatherers or Carcassonne Discovery); but if you are willing to shell out a bit more money for one or two expansions, Carcassonne is the way to go. *** I highly recommend using the 3rd Edition scoring rules for farmers.

It's a fun game, but the end is fairly anticlimactic.  The expansions make the game more interesting to play, but the scoring gets a little bit annoying with too many complications.  Sometimes, I feel frustrated that it ends so soon, and sometimes, I get bored, an odd mix.

One of the games I played as my initiation into the "real" world of board games (I say real to distinguish my previous experience of playing chess, checkers, clue and the usual slew of common family games).

Have not played it with any expansion, but may try someday, or when someone in our gaming group decides to play.

RATING: 7
This is the first Euro my wife and I tackled, and it remains our favorite.  We prefer to play with lots of expansions (my rating to the left is for the base game with no expansions), so all of the extra tiles and rules mean we pretty much only play original Carc together or with our friends who are as obsessed as we are. Even for us, though, expansion fatigue has kicked in, and we're finally done buying them. (This was after The Catapult, around the time Z-Man acquired the game.) Out of what we own, here's my take on what you need and what you can do without:    

[u]Essential expansions:[/u] [thing=2993]Inns & Cathedrals,[/thing] [thing=5405]Traders & Builders[/thing]

[u]Strongly suggested for experienced players:[/u] [thing=31784]Abbey & Mayor,[/thing] [thing=35666]Cult, Siege & Creativity,[/thing] the King portion of the [thing=7707]King & Scout[/thing] expansion, [thing=92332]The Phantom[/thing]

[u]Nice to have, but entirely optional:[/u] [thing=2591]The River[/thing] (included in our copy of the base game), [thing=18836]The River II,[/thing] [thing=26615]The Mini-Expansion[/thing]

[u]Recommended for the hardcore only, or those wanting more direct screwage:[/u] [thing=12903]The Count,[/thing] [thing=21385]The Tower,[/thing] [thing=15158]The Princess & the Dragon[/thing]

[u]Objectively silly, but we couldn't resist:[/u] [thing=38855]The Catapult[/thing]

I would advise those looking for a complete Carc experience in a single purchase to check out [thing=4390]Hunters & Gatherers[/thing] or [thing=6779]The Ark Of the Covenant,[/thing] or even [thing=12902]The City[/thing] if you want more of a "gamer" version.

My recorded plays include all expansions except for The Count, The Tower, and The Princess & The Dragon, which are all recorded separately.

This was the German game that got me hooked so what can I say?  It will always be a favorite.  The whole idea of creating a board as you play combined with the short rules and cool bits just blew my mind.  Putting the tiles out always feels creative to me.  Whimsical, light and happy, this is a game that makes me smile.  I love the artwork. I recommend it for kids and adults. We always draw one tile ahead to keep the turns moving.  We don't use the river expansion but do use Inns and Cathedrals.

RATING: 7
Like Alhambra, this game should not be played with more than three players, otherwise it will get too chaotic. I think the reason why this game has been so successful is that it (like PR) can be played on many different levels, both laidback and very cutthroat. I quite like the vanilla version, because it makes it easier to keep track of the tile distribution and gives the players more chances to block each other. With two good players that know the tiles well this can be an almost chess-like experience. And if you are concerned about the luck of draw there are many variants out there to mitigate that as well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I think the strong points of this game are it's scalablity in players from 2-6 as well as complexity and time with the expansions.  There's few games that are so versatile.  It can be extremely easy and light, or long and somewhat complex.  I suggest anyone look at the variants who haven't.  It pretty much appeals to everyone as well.  No one can resist a meeple I guess.

One of the first games I bought when I started getting into the hobby. I have played this a lot with different groups and in different settings and it is always a hit. I will never get tired of this game.

It is so pure and simple yet every turn is exciting. What will you draw from the bag? How will you use that tile?

I always play with the Traders & Builders expansion as it makes the game even more interesting and add a lot of fun new tiles.

[Tile-laying] [2P:4, 3P:3, 4P:3] How in the world did Carcassonne win the DSP? It's so fluffy and random, makes Puerto Rico a computational monster. It's still a decent gateway game to introduce the non-gamers to German-style boardgames, but more than three players increases the downtime (and the already-limited pleasure of putting tiles down) too much. The expansions don't do anything to improve this simple, rather boring game. Carc is most suited for children and non-gamer family and friends. *** UPDATE: Revisited the game to give it another chance, and it fell flat on its face with two newbies. It also bored me three-quarters to death. I really do not understand the appeal, but I'm not playing this or any of its non-Knizia derivatives ever again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
My first Euro-style game. I really like it so far, and enjoy the mechanic. It's relaxing and fun, with enough depth to keep you interested and guessing the whole game.

Pros:

*Simple on the outside, deep on the inside. 
*Long term strategy. If you only plan a couple turns ahead, you loose. 
*City building is a great theme and makes the game as interesting as it is.
*Meeples
*Short turns, fairly quick yet very satisfying game.
*Good quality bits, and plain old fun

Cons:
*I love expansions, but man... too many. 
*Expansions needed to keep the game interesting (after a good 15 plays or so, imo), which means lots of moneys.

I'm actually enjoying it less with more plays (and with more players) and haven't felt the remotest desire to pull this out in a long, long time. I feel like I'm missing something as for some reason, I'm just not as into it as most other people are. 

It's a good 2-player option to have around and an easy to explain/play gateway game, though I have to admit, no non-gamer I've taught has really fallen in love with this game unlike Settlers, TTR or Pandemic. As games go quick, I'm always happy to play this to teach and am glad I own it even if I'd rather play other games.

While not the perfect game, I do love Carcassonne.

As with all games where you draw a single tile or card blindly, you are at the mercy of luck.  But a fair bit of this game's strategy is ensuring you don't need to rely on luck, and making the best with what you get.

Lots and lots of expansions make Carcassonne quite customizable, though some expansions are better than others.  Buying a couple of the large expansions or a Big Box is almost obligatory.

Of all the games I own, this is in my top 3.

Possibly my favorite gateway game thanks to the straightforward rules and lack of setup time.

I recommend playing without the farmer when teaching it to people new to modern board games. It's also worth noting that some people just flat out struggle to "get" farms. Some people I've played with really enjoy the game but fail to visualize the farms, making it difficult for them to keep up and compete.

Nowadays, we don't play without The River, Inns & Cathedrals and Traders & Builders.

This one comes out with the family a lot. Lot's of people think of it as a gateway game, but I have trouble teaching it. I have had success teaching the first game without farms, then adding farms the second game.

It also makes a great lunchtime game.
-----------------------------
[Update] This will probably continue to be the family's most played game for a while. It has enough elements for my wife, who likes an asthetically pleasing result, and finds that more important than a win. It has enough tactically to satisfy my son and I, who are a little more cutthroat. Actually, we have a friend who wins regularly by playing a low key, opportunistic game while the sharks are out eating each other, so there are lots of routes to success.

The basic game plays quickly, particularly if you take the next tile at the end of your turn, giving you a "hand" of one tile. That gives everyone a chance to think a little before their turn arrives. The end result is a game with strategically solid game played in roughly an hour.

Carefull with expansions.  I think it would be pretty easy to have a pretty chaotic experience if one tried to play too many expansions at once.

RATING: 8
A great modern classic with a split personality: it is accessible and friendly, making it the perfect gateway to the hobby; but also strategic and cutthroat, to keep veterans coming back. Tweak it to best suit the occasion; from a fast, laid-back, cooperative-feeling experience for beginners; to a multi-layered, competitive epic (by throwing in some of the many available expansions and house rules). You can't go wrong with this one.

Played again with 5 players, much better than 2. Farmers seem a little powerful.
Now we have played this quite a few times, we found the river expansion can balance the game more by reducing the effect of farmers (mostly but not always), best with 4-5 players. Discovered we were scoring farmers incorrectly making the game somewhat unbalanced, game is much more enjoyable now

Played first game of this today (6-28-2012) with Mr. Billington.  I lost, but we both had fun.  He wants to play it again, and so do I.  Played second game of this today (7-7-2012) with Mr. Billington.  This time I won (114-112, I think).  We're getting better at it (especially learning which scores are worth going after at which times during the game, and how to score for various parts) and enjoying it more.  Wish there were more tiles in each copy of the game.  The game seems to end so soon as is.  Maybe that's a good thing.  Regret that there wasn't more is always a plus.  Gott sei dank fur Herr Wrede!  Played two games of this today (7-8-2012) with Noelle; first game was interrupted halfway through by my mom's cat Tusk, but Noelle was winning; second game Noelle won (but had I finished my last (big) castle, I would've won, though not by a whole lot).  Another game of this today (7-13-2012) with Mr. Billington (I won; 85 or 95 to 75, I think), and we both discovered that more aggressive/back-stabbing games tend to have fewer points than non-aggressive/non-back-stabbing games.  Not sure if this is true for other players, though.  Now have 3 sets of the basic game, so that should make it even *more* fun to play (okay, and longer too).  Can't wait to play a three-set game!  Played incomplete 2-set game (plus River II expansion) today and definitely the hot weather didn't help either myself or my opponent.  But I think we liked the new setup.  At least I did.

Juegazo con el que me inicié, junto a Catán, pero que ha aguantado el paso del tiempo muchísimo mejor y aún hoy me apetece seguir jugándolo y expandiéndolo. Me parece que está infravalorado entre jugones. Sin dejar de ser un juego ligero de reglas, sí permite jugar estratégicamente y usar cada loseta y trabajador de manera muy meditada. Y lo mejor es el puteo de robar construcciones, que es la chicha que más gusta en partidas entre jugones y que genera piques revancheros.

Las ilustraciones de Doris Matthaus me parecen geniales y me hacen pensar que estoy jugando a un juego de mesa de los antiguos, añejo, de cuando era pequeño.

En cuanto a las expansiones, aconsejo jugar el base más dos expansiones grandes o el base más una expansión grande y otra pequeña. Si caemos en el error de incluir más expansiones de la cuenta, el juego se eterniza, ocupa demasiada mesa y además algunas mecánicas de expansiones quedan eclipsadas por otras que son más rentables.

Great game but the novelty does wear off with time.  The dearth of expansions (mini and major) allow one to balance the length and complexity to fit time available, number of players and ability.
Note however that the rules become unwieldy when using too many expansions simultaneously !

My girlfriend's all-time favorite. We play it only with 2 players (me and her :-)  as then it's at its most strategic (always with expasion 1 & 2). With more players i would give a much lower rating.

Pretty okay game. Decent with two players but otherwise I'll avoid it. A little boring for me. I don't find it a great gateway game as most because the scoring is a little too complicated. Needs at least one throwaway game which disqualifies it as a gateway for me.

This is a great game to play with a spouse who dislikes all of your cool wargames. Carcassonne offers strategy without direct opponent confrontation, which means that your wife will still talk to you if you win the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Easy to learn easy to play and there's something satisfying about seeing a little countryside constructed from nothing but a one tile seed.  

The game offers enough strategic variety to stay interesting over multiple plays, but the fact that you never know quite what to expect (unless you spend far more time counting tiles than I care to) leaves a bit of room for some good surprises and slightly tense bits.

Good fun all around!

My girlfriend, whom I introduced the fun of board gaming to, will not leave me alone about carcassonne! I love the game but every night shes begging to play it. She texts me during our work days talking smack or asking to play at 8pm when the kids hit the hay. We have just about every expansion for it. except for the catapult. She wants to make an extra large bag (bag included in the builders and traders exp) so we can hold all the tiles from org + expansions+ wheel of fortune all at once..good lord. So anyway its a great game. Any friends we have introduced have liked it first play. And oh we don't play with the dragon/fairy cause I tend to get neglected or vise versa for a day or more do to temper flares! (we do use the tiles that came with the set though) Get it. its easy to learn

Carcassonne is alright. It takes up a large amount of space and shuffling a giant stack of tiles isn't the best. The actual game play is pretty fun and easy to learn but has complicated strategies. I like looking at the city at the end of a game.

The first game that I bought when I got back into board gaming.

I don't play it as much as I used to - there are just so many other great games competing for play time - but, I will always keep a copy in my collection.

I prefer it with 2 or 3 players as it keeps things tight and moving along. Would stretch to 4 but would avoid anything over that as the game can drag at that point.

The game has a bit more going on than it first seems which is great for players of different experience. You can build this landscape together and pick up your points or start to engineer geographical ambushes to hijack the points from rivals farms and cities.

It's a "gateway" game with legs.

I've played Carcassonne - Hunters and Gatherers before this one and rate it a solid 9. The original Carcassonne is much less interesting with the rules saying you score unfinished roads and towns. I think there are fixes and variants everywhere on the web but I don't care for them since H&G comes packed with a good and simple rule. Also, scoring meadows is simpler and more interesting in H&G.

I like a lot about this game - competitive, probabilistic thinking, and interesting tension between short term, medium term, and long term point gains. My son started playing this when he was 4 (no farmers), and full rules by the age of 5 and he continues to like it.

However, my wife SO doesn't like the end-of-game importance of farmers (where everything you've worked towards all game can be undone by 1 or 2 skillful and/or lucky farmer placements) that it's hard to get her to play. The result is that we play this far less than comparable gateway games. That's what brings down the score for me - if it's hard to get my favorite game partner to play, then what good is it?

We tried the expansion Traders and Builders and that made it even more fun for me but less for my wife. Haven't used any of the other expansions.

Carcassonne is one of my favourite games and one of the favourites of my group of players. Why? 1) Carcassonne has easy to learn rules, but not so easy to win strategic “tricks” (you can learn its rules in one hour but you can’t say you’re a good player after you have played this game at least ten or more times. 2) Thematic is very, very good appointed for a game like this; 3) All its components are well done and pretty look designed; 4) Mechanics are so simple (in appearance), but so brilliant and well balanced after all! I simply love Carcassonne and in my opinion this one must be ranked between the first twenty games in the BGG board games ranking scale.

One of the first games I purchased when I discovered German games. I think that with all the expansions and with 2 tiles to look at rather than just one this game is better. Great to play with 2 or 3 players. Easy for nongamers to understand but deep enough for gamers to battle it out. After researching around it seems like I better purchase Carcassonne: the City too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
With a group, this game works because it offers interactivity between players and a few opportunities for creative strategy. But this game really shines with two players, where it becomes much more tactical and combative. The fact that it takes exactly 30 seconds to set-up and 45 to take down makes it even better. Great game. This could have been packaged as a two player game and I would have been happy, but the fact that it plays with 5 is great. FANTASTIC.

RATING: 6
One of the gateway classics. One of the great things about Carc is that it scales very well from 2 up to 5 (or 6 with the expansion). Even though this gets played a bit too often, I still like to break it out every now and then. Most of the expansions are pretty much unnecessary and rather take away from the game than add to it, in my opinion.

  Family favorite.  Winning does depend on skill.

  After years of play and the fact this game hits the table so often I've had to up my rating.  With over 2000 boardgames in my 'collection' I'm almost afraid to say Carc. has the most plays.  It's a gateway game that I've always had fun playing even with complete tabletop gaming newbies.  I'm also surprised at myself for admitting that all the Carcassonne expansions HAS kept it in the cult of the new.

I bought a version with new graphical design and two mini expasions (River I. + Abbot).
Thanks to new look is a Carcassonne acceptable for me at last. Mini expansion in the core box gives you huge variety in the process of setting up. But overall number of area tiles is still disturbing a little bit. I recomented to you buy an first expansion in common with base box of Carcassonne. As time will go, You will need more specific tiles to overcome specific situations. Carcassone is the one of my best games for TWO players, Which I have ever played.

Rated with first two expansions:
- Catedrals & Inns

Tile laying fun.  Simple if you play it that way.  But if your serious, it can burn your brain.  Placing farmers, linking them to existing farms and watching the tile distribution can turn it into a real strong game.

Carc is one of those games that just never gets old. For us it's almost exclusively a 2p game, but we'll play 3 on occasion. At some point in 2017 I'd like to try one of the other Carcs, especially H&G and The Discovery.

I only played this game once after getting it in a trade and then kept it on a shelf for many months.  Once I played with someone who knew the game well a lightbulb went off in my head.  I can see why this is a classic.

Carcassonne is a classic for a reason. So simple to learn and engaging to new players with that beautiful artwork. Yes there's an element of luck with tile selection and I do find higher player counts suffer from a lack of tiles, but expansions help solve these issues. A great game for any collection.

My first gateway game purchase in 2010. Played many more times than listed here. My family really likes it, but we play the "nice" way where everybody builds their own stuff with no stealing. I'm trying to convince them that the "mean" (read: normal) way is better. Since this first purchase, I've been bitten by the Acquisition Bug. We have so many more games to chose from that Carcassonne rarely makes it to the table anymore.

Played it for first time and played 3 times back to back 2 player with my wife. I sensed she was confused about the farm placement so we left it out all 3 times. I just made a point to discuss what makes up a farm and how it's scored after we finished each game. I like the game and think it's simple enough that we'll bring it to table regularly. This along with Ticket to Ride and Pandemic/Forbidden island should help get a gaming fire going nicely for 2p with wife.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Even as players place with the intent of making placement harder for each other player or of stealing features from each other, the game remains surprisingly serene.
The tile distribution is pretty good: While it is easy to focus on the tiles one isn't getting, there is very rarely nothing useful to do with a piece if one gives more thought to a it.
Unfortunately, a lot of the game is centered around stealing particularly valuable features which is basically luck based in effectiveness.

Carcassonne has quickly become a classic of board gaming. Meeples are iconic! I like this game mainly because it can be played with different levels of complexity (there are so many expansions). It's a flexible game: with 2 players it is almost chess-like, challenging, but it can also be played with children as a more "relaxing" landscape building game.

Purchased 05/17/06--version with River expansion included


After one 2p play (w/o River)--nice, fast, fun filler.  Again, I'm not sure 2p is the best config for this (many games advertise 2p as an option, and I'm starting to think that's just pure marketing rather than any sort of truth).  Not "crowded" enough for 2p.  I did notice that due to farmers I totally destroyed my brother by over 40 points (and 36 of that came from farmers...)

Won't go expansion happy with this.  Will try soon with 3 or 4.  Might look into one or two of the more highly regarded expansions.


Rating certainly might go up after more plays.


EDIT:  This one is starting to drop faster than expected...last two plays have been sort of "meh".  Getting very samey.  I have a few expansions already but they only help a little.  Down from an 8 to a 7.


HAVE THESE SMALL EXPANSIONS:

The Mini Expansion
The River
The Count of Carcassonne

RATING: 8
Carcassonne with traders and builders expansion is tremendous fun.  I also recommend Inns and Cathedrals. It is fairly strategic (in a light, fun way) when you play with 2-3 players.  You can't use as much planning ahead when you play with more players, but it's just fun no matter what!  For someone who plays with light gamers or regular gamers, this game is just ideal.  I believe with the 2 mentioned expansions, this one goes way beyond what you expect.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.274
Brilliant as a first choice Eurogame when introducing a newbie; but probably a bit too too much luck over tactics to regularly sustain playing.  When 4 or 5 players, game starts to become too chaotic to be tactical. More a game for those who enjoy the journey rather than the destination (and hence for 5 players, would -1 from rating if not with newbies).  River expansion a mild diversion if you were a regular player, and you may need to clarify which edition rules you are using at the start of play, otherwise there will be argument over scoring of farmers (13/12/08).  UPDATE: the iPhone application has resulted in my rediscovery of how wonderful this game is, especially after I introduced it at work and with friends.  It really is an enjoyable classic, and I update the rating from 7 to 9, especially as the 4-5 player game starts introduction the concept of mini-alliances which can negate some of the luck of the cards (26/12/10).  UPDATE: To clarify rating, I have given vanilla Carc a rating of 7, but Inns & Cathedrals as a 9; hard to imagine not playing this with the expansion except when introducing the game to newbies - clearly an active game and a definite classic of Eurogaming (17/9/11). UPDATE: Vanilla Carc is still a great game (8.274; May 15).

For those who complain about how simple, random, and boring it is: play with smarter people. It's simplicity is deceptive, and while tile-draws are random and memorizing the deck helps, in the end it comes down to thinking ahead and cleverly positioning yourself for the future.

The balance is wonderful-- while cloisters seem hugely important for the first couple games, you will soon realize that a well thought-out farm or stolen city can be just as effective. This mixture of easy-to-grasp concepts paired with devious strategies make this one of the best games ever.

Everyone who I've taught it to, gamers and non alike, has loved it.

fast play and simple. Tile laying is fun even without a good understanding of the rules and tactics. It's grown on me more over a few plays, but I feel it lacks a certain spark of excitement that other games of a similar weight have. won't play it without Inns and cathedrals expansion.

Having got the game on the iPhone, i've enjoyed playing it more, and this has extended into real world play. Still a classic with the farmer placement being a competitive "hidden" battle.

This score includes using the Inns and Cathedrals expansion, which I think adds a great push-your-luck aspect to the game.  Adding tiles from other expansions is recommended, but most other rulesets just add cruft in my opinion.  The only extra rules that I think are worthwhile are the trading rules from Builders and Traders (the builder's C-C-C-Combo ability is ridiculous).

As a gateway, I haven't found this goes over as well as TTR or card games, but I don't recall anyone having poor opinions of it.

Simple but exellent. So many choices and when you finish you just sigh looking at the board you created and attaching the tiles so no space between them. The game can change totally by pulling one tile or putting meeple in a good point. I gave it only 7 becuase I never play with out river exapnsion, much more fun with the expansion.

I find Carcassonne to be a wonderful game that can host a large number of people with varying difficulty.  As far as adding expansions I believe only Inns & Cathedrals, and Traders & Builders to be a must.  All others add their own little thing, but in many ways bog down this little gem.

Update:  the more I play games of Carc the more I find the things that make me truly recognize what a brilliant design this game is.  It may have the luck of the draw, but it offers a gateway experience, and light quick play that surpasses most other titles of similar ilk.  Although many new games have adopted the tile laying mechanic, I really think Wrede did it the most elegant.

I carried this with me while backpacking: it's portable and can be played on any flat surface. It's rules are simple and don't take too long to explain (and I've explained them a few dozen times now), and yet those rules create a really fun and interesting game. The motif is well-chosen for the game mechanic and adds to the ease of learning and the fun. This is the game that brought me back into board gaming, and through it I've introduced many other people to the idea that board games are (so much) more than Scrabble and Monopoly.

[BGCOLOR=#66ff99][b][COLOR=#66ff99]_[/COLOR]8[COLOR=#66ff99]_[/COLOR][/b][/BGCOLOR][b]:[/b] Very good game. Rarely disappoints me. High on my request/recommend list.

If you play against me, you'll agree that *I* am an a$$hole.

I'd actually like to play this more often.  It's easy enough for my oldest to play with I&C and no farmer scoring.  I think the sheer number of tiles and anticipated game length causes this to miss the table.

Plus I have 3 sets of camo meeples!

To me, the multiple expansions almost work against it, making it less and less elegant.

I like playing Carcassonne with my kids (8 & 6 at this time) as they are into the map-building aspect of the game and not the cut-throat aspect of sabotaging others moves and plans.

An old favorite, I like to bring it out when people want a light game.  However, the random tile-draw mechanic means that you often cannot do what you want to do (like stopping the leader), which means those tense, close decisions are few and far between.  I usually play with one or more expansions to add a little meat to the game.

Truly excellent (light) game. Together with the expansions it's even better. The game can get aggressive and very exciting with experienced players and is not dull at all (like some misguided, inexperienced players claim). 

I prefer playing a variant in which every player has 4 tiles on his hand, plays a tile and replenishes the hand at the end of his/her turn. This way it's more strategic and tactical and less random. 

I also prefer the 3rd edition rules for scoring farms.

Carcassonne is a great game.  Since I do not own any expansions, I enjoy it best with 2 players.  More than that and the game goes a little too quickly since there are only so many tiles to go around with the base set.  I also prefer to play where you have two tiles in hand to choose from instead of just blindly drawing one.  It just gives you move options and it burns a little less when you draw 3 road tiles in a row.
It is pretty simple to teach and plays quickly, so people pick it up pretty quickly, but there is a ton of strategy built into this little game.  Especially true when you play with two tiles instead of one.
All around a solid game.

This game on its own is alright. Just alright. Definite potential. But the game REALLY comes to life with the expansion 'Inns and Cathedrals'. As many say, it should have been part of the original game. After adding that expansion and 'Traders and Builders' it feels more rounded and robust in strategies.

Lots of people mention the luck factor in the game, but I think it's all about making the tiles you draw work for you. You have to be flexible and go with the flow in this game. There is limited planning ahead BECAUSE of the luck of the draw, but it doesn't dampen the strategy too much. Even so, you can make a slight rule modification that you can hold 2 or 3 tiles in your hand.

But all in all, I often wonder why this game is always in the top 15. I mean, it's not THAT good. It's an OK time passer, but not something I would consider spectacular enough to be among the top rated and most popular games. And when introducing this game to new players, it's hit or miss. Many don't seem to like it at all. So just keep that in mind.


For trade. In like new condition, also have the expansions Inns & Cathedrals, Traders & Builders, and The River II

I have never actually played Carcassonne as a board game, however I've played many times on the Xbox 360 and I find the fact that I don't have to keep track of points manually to be a significant deterrent to purchasing the board game. The entire game revolves around adding up small amounts of points and I can see how a gaming session could quickly devolve into math class with near chaos over what might have been forgotten.

I keep playing this game hoping I will enjoy it, but just doesn't appeal to me. I plan to try the game again without randomly drawing tiles, which is the part of the game that most irritates me.

Klaus-Jurgen Wrede has masterfully created a delightful game of castles and cloisters, complete with dragons and fairies.  FYI dragons can totally eat monks.  The expansion packs are nice too for extra tiles.  The game is easily customizable, as we found the dragon menacing and adjusted the rules to make him a bit less disruptive to game play.  Great go-to game for fun.

[Original comment] Great family game -- especially for folks who like a challenge, but who don't care for war games or themes of violence or mayhem. Can be played friendly or very competitive.

Update February 2006 -- We always play with three expansions: The River, Inns and Cathedrals, and Traders and Builders. The latter two add lots of scoring variables, which makes the game more challenging. Great for 5 or 6 players.

(December 2006) We've added some components, to allow for 7 players, and it works fine. This is a very popular game in our family group.

May 2009 -- This is still a favorite game for us, and we play it occasionally.

October 2011 -- We continue to play with the same expansions and thoroughly enjoy this game. It is one of my favorites.

November 2012 -- This game never grows old, and remains a family favorite. Recently, in a 3-player game, it appeared my son and I had tied (with over 300 points, each), until I noticed and told him that he had a few more points coming, with his pig in one of the fields he scored. Great game!

2013-November: Another year, and we still like this game very much.

As time has gone by, my rating of this one has slowly dropped. When it was new, it was great! Innovative! Awesome!

But over time, other games have implemented or re-implemented elements of this game in a faster-playing way. And then this got bogged down by a steady churn of expansions (the first couple are really good, but the game really went downhill after that).

It started as a nine for our group, and is now a six.  It hasn't hit the table in ... a long while, actually, and I'll be surprised if it hits the table any time soon.

It's definitely a good game to own, if for nothing else then to introduce non-gamers to modern gaming.

As everyone already knows, this is a good game of tile placing.  I like it because its easy to teach others to play and has a surprising amount of strategy involved... but it does mean that you end up thrashing any beginners which may leave you short on potential players.  But with the iphone and ipad version, I suspect some rematches in the future.

Always enjoy it in the midst of play, but rarely feel the urge to suggest it. Have yet to try some of the more chaotic expansions. Did make some homemade Die Katharer tiles and like the nastiness it brings.

Entertaining.  Don't play it with too many players, and IMHO don't play it too often.  I rarely play it and I am just fine with that.  If someone wants to play it or bring it out, I'd be glad to play.  But I don't crave to play it or delight in games of Carcassonne.  It is an excellent starter Euro if that's your bag, once you get past the (often decisive) farmer scoring.

Incidentally, the Xbox Live implementation is quite good.  I grabbed it when it was free for Live's 5th birthday.

This is another good game, designwise, that I've worn out and is slightly boring to me.

One of my favorites to play with my wife, and a great game to pull out when non-gamer family are over. I prefer Carcassonne as a two-player game because I feel that luck of the draw becomes too much of a factor with more players. The game's inability to scale well prevents me from rating higher. Good with certain expansions, but Hunters and Gatherers also offers a more robust experience out of the box.

Quite fun game. Simple rules, quick.

The game that launched a thousand other Carcassonne games.  Strong on its own, and yet with a wide variety of expansions available to choose from to mix the game up a bit.  The artwork on this is still my favorite of all the Carcassonne games, including The City.  I personally kind of like that things have to be completed in order to score.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

A classic, and an excellent introductory game. Laying tiles and building a landscape feels satisfying and enjoyable, even if the farming dynamic makes it really quite cutthroat at times. Plus as an added bonus you can make rude shapes out of your cities...

A nasty game of backstabbing, negative gameplay and stealing roads, farmlands and castles, while you are pretending you are just building something.

Then I saw it at the Thrift store for $2.00 and bought it thinking I could certainly sell it for $10 if I did not like it.  Well, as you can see from my rating, I like it.  I like it so much that I bought a few of the expansions and made a few fan designed expansions.

One of our game groups favourites. It plays well but differently for each number of players. At 2 it is a bit of a double solitaire but for 3 and 4 it allows a lot of interaction both positive and negative. At 5 it becomes a bit chaotic and difficult to build larger roads/cities. Just starting to try and get a handle on farmers now.

It's an old standby.  My wife and I love to play one on one with all the expansions loaded up and makes for a long and complex game.

We'll wear this game out eventually, I'm sure.

Very simple game (despite the intial description of rules and gameplay), may seem bland for some, scales very well, more strategy than it appears at first, but some luck in drawing the 'right' tiles.

Edit:
Of the 3 major gateways, this is probably (and unexplicably) my favorite. I believe it plays best with 2 players, and with more it does scale well but is a bit less strategic (but fun nonetheless). Additionally, I have yet to try it with any expansions, as the game seems fairly well balanced as it is and I'm afraid the expansions may change the gameplay a bit more than I would like.

I dropped this rating from an '8' when Hunters and Gatherers came out. Basic Carcassonne is still an excellent game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It's a pretty cool game, but I think it should probably be played with two players only to be able to manage the luck of the draw a little more. And maybe it would be more interesting to have a small hand of tiles to choose from at all times. My rating might go up after some repeated play with only two players. 

Update: Definitely felt like a better game with a small hand of three tiles to choose from when building.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Difficult to rate accurately, to the extent that it matters. Carc has been so often expanded that what does it even mean to rate the base game alone any more?

This was one of my first euro-style games and thus has nostalgic value, but I'm trying to eliminate that from how I think of games. It is a very good 2p in general, significantly less interesting with more people.

A light sprinkling of expansions is probably best, preferably only River, I&C, and maaaybe T&B.

No dragons, no walls, no counts, no effing catapults.

A nice looking, tile-laying family game. It plays short, there are few ways to get points and it's fun. When playing on similar levels the luck factor can decide who wins. But who cares since the game is sheer fun. It's my wife's favourite game and I also enjoy playing it. After trying home rules variant I think the original rules are good enough not to change them.

Edit: now I think the randomness is too big too really enjoy the win. Rating down.

[b]Carcassonne[/b] [i]Klaus Jurgen Wrede 2000[/i] 
An excellent game for beginners, but also playable for gamers. This game is at its best when played with its first two expansions: Inns and Cathedrals and Traders and Builders. Abbey and Major is your third call, good expansion only if you own the other two as well. By its own, Carcassonne is a friendly game that usually is a hit with non gamers, but must be played at most with four players. More people around the table make and the game evolves to a festival of chaos. I dont like some of the newer expansions do, which add chaos, randomness and unnecessary complications. Otherwise is the only gateway game I own and a very clever design.

And there are a lot of small expansions, that are all very good together...

This is my girlfriend's favorite game (I think).  More often than not, if I ask whether she wants to play a game, this is it, although Touch of Evil might replace it.  This game is insanely easy to teach/learn and is just simply fun, you can be up and running in under 5 minutes.  This is still a fun game but I'm beginning to worry that I'm getting burned out on it.  This is such a standard "go-to" that I feel like that this is the only thing that gets play.  I'm tempted at times to pick up some expansions, but I really don't know how much it will affect the game as the base set seems extremely appealing to my girlfriend and I don't want to alter it to the point where she won't want to play.

Before you read any of this: No, I don't have constructive criticism towards the game. Only irrational dislike towards it, don't know why...

I really don't like this game. At all. I'll play it if it's been something like 6 months since last and merely if their's no option, but otherwise I'll pass. 

Me and my brother have a little game we call "Who can hate Carcassonne the most?": If anyone (anyone!) mentions Carcassonne in our presence we have to come up with the most ridicilous reasons for hating the game. I think the winner is "Our parents were killed by a game of Carcassonne" followed by a knife-stabbing motion.

Jackpot. If there's one game that I wish I had invented, it might be Carcassonne. Game mechanics in its simplicity is just brilliant. In my opinion the weight of luck has overrated in this game. In the long run (shorter than commonly expected) better player always wins.

I'm a big fan of Carcassonne, like many other people I'm sure.  I find it very easy to teach, and when you pack the big box down into a Plano Box, it travels very well.

I don't love how much the beating someone by linking up fields can dictate things, but it's a minor quibble.  I know some people don't love the "big city wins" thing, so perhaps it's a matter of taste.

There isn't really an expansion I don't like.  Pretty much always play with traders and builders, and inns and cathedrals.  The rest are sort of hit and miss as to whether we play with them.

I credit Carcassonne with igniting my boardgame mania and my discovery of BGG. I love fitting the tiles together and finding optimal ways to use my meeples. 

This game is delightful for 2 players. With 6 players, the game is excruciating. I have not played it with other numbers of players.

The expansions add extra fun, but I'm always tempted to play with all of them at once, which is overwhelming to my husband and makes game too long.

Super fun game.  Actually HIGHLY recommend the Big Box 3.  Great value.  This game is a worker placement/tile layer that provides a quick set up and clean up with lots of strategy in the middle.  Becomes a 9 with Inns and Cathedrals and Traders and Builders. 

I only play the variant where you start with 3 tiles and then draw back up to three at the end of your turn.  This is as opposed to draw 1 tile at the beginning of the turn.  The variant is MUCH faster.

It astounds me that this game gets the love and adoration it does, not just on this site, but around the world. Yes, it's a pretty little puzzle you're building but it's also dull as dishwater. People talk about how tactical you can be but really it's not that difficult to choose an optimal move on any given turn. The game may as well play itself.

For a more interesting, fun but still ligthweight game, I recommend Havana.

I owned this game for over two years before playing it.  I couldn't get over the ugly tiles, and had other, more serious games to play.

My wife and I truly love this game.  It works best as a 2 player, but doesn't suffer much in a 3 player game.  More than that and it weakens a bit because each player has fewer turns.

We often use this as one of our intro games to get non-gamers interested in playing board games with us.  The mechanics are super simple.  I've been able to teach my 5 year old niece and my in-laws to play.  

Simple mechanics, easy to grasp, very enjoyable.

UPDATE: after not playing it for almost a year, we got it out on a night we didn't have the energy for a longer / heavier game.  It's still refreshingly great.  It's light enough that we can have an interesting conversation while playing and it doesn't interfere with figuring out our moves, but it's not so light that it's boring.  I removed Traders & Builders and the River II, leaving only Inns & Cathedrals and it plays smoother and more elegantly.  What a great way to spend time together.  This game probably more than any other turned my wife and I into board gamers.

Definitely worthy of its reputation and its popularity.  Carcassonne is one of those rare games that appeals to hobby gamers, families, and even non-gamers.  It has surpassed Bohnanza, Settlers of Catan, Daytona 500, Union Pacific, and Showmanager as my #1 game to pull out with non-gamers. [Edit: it has since been usurped in this capacity by Ticket to Ride.]  And among seasoned gamers, the game reveals a surprising level of depth.  By all means, use the original farmer scoring rules (4 points awarded per city to whomever has the most farmers touching the city).  It is better balanced, more intuitive, and easier to explain than the later revisions.  Carcassonne in its basic configuration rates at least an 8 with me, and judicious use of expansions knocks it to a solid 9 or even approaching 10.

Carcassonne is a fun, easy to learn game that supports a good number of players (up to 5 or 6 with expansions).

I played with slightly adjusted rules -- roads were worth 2 points if completed, just like castles. This made the game feel a little less luck based (sometimes you just don't draw any castle tiles).

There are plenty of important decisions to be made in game based only on the mechanics, but managing how you cooperate or compete with others is the real meat of the game.

This game is great in that its fast to teach and you can coach new players through their moves. It's a reasonable balance of luck and strategy. Expansions mean that you can really change the dynamics of the game to make it more competitive or cooperative. We started with the basic game which came with the river and have added the Inns & Cathedrals and Traders & Builders expansions but I would have happily bought the biggest "Big Box" they made. This game has been such a good investment. It's not amazingly fun, but it's a solid game with great replay value and versatility.

Like too many people, one of my first Euro-games (after Settlers). I could not be happier. I return to Carcassonne again and again. Have found, however, that I get bored with too many people. Luck increases significantly with higher numbers. Prefer good 2-player cut-throat games. Inns & Cathedrals a must. Traders & Builders preferred. (Rest of the expansions? Meh.)

Good gateway but have found that the farm rules are confusing for many non-gamers the first time around. Also, regular players have a significant advantage because of knowledge of the tiles.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Carcassonne was probably the game that introduced me to the hobby (and it was the first game I got as a gift) and I have introduced other players to the hobby with this game. And for that alone it has my greatest respect as a game. Later I played this game too much and my view of it has faded quite a bit. Usually I prefer to play games with players that are experienced in the game, but this is not true for this game, since I found that people that know too much about the distribution of tiles (and even tile counting). There are measures that can be made against it (by playing several expansions and remove tiles), but it is not what I usually do. With more plays, many moves seem to be automatic or random since you don’t know what will come up in the next tile draw.

There is a wide appeal for this game for mainly two reasons I think. First it looks stunning when completed. There is something satisfying building the landscape in the game and is something completely different from more traditional games. Secondly, the rules are quite simple, where you pick a tile, place it and if you want to place a follower on the tile.

Many expansions are available, but I prefer to not play with too many of them for the reason that it takes an elegant game and bloat it. I much like the simplicity of the main game.

I usually play this as a two player game with my girlfriend and it works great. You can choose to either build your own stuff or try to sabotage (something I rarely do however). It also works great with three or four players. With more players the game tends to be more chaotic and more competition and helping to completing large areas. I don’t recommend playing the game with five players, since I found it to be too chaotic.

Four or five plays, I think. Enjoyable with two, but with each added player the control drops off precipitously. Overall I much prefer Carcassonne: the Castle.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A great cross-over game to play with my wife or the less hardcore gamers in my crowd. I like it best with two, three, or four players (although the tone of the game is definitely different with more players). It has weaknesses as a pure game, but as a quasi-competitive way to build a puzzle and while away an hour or so it is without peer. Now basically playing it to death on iOS.

RATING: 8
Nice simple easy to learn and cleverly designed. Never a dull game and always fun to see who sneaked that 'cheesey' farmer in at the last minute. If you don't own this then you should. Avoid Princess and Dragon and I couldn't see any point in Hunters and Gatherers
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
There's too much randomness and not enough control in Carcassonne for me.  Playing with 2 player improves the game but I have at least 20 better 2 player game that I'd rather play than this one.

RATING: 8
A classic. This should be on everyone's shelf.
Easy to teach and a great intro to German games as well as tile-laying/placement. New edition (2014) includes the river expansion which I enjoy.

RATING: 7
Pros: A solid game, and one I have fun playing.  Great for introducing non-gamers to deeper games (worked on me, my gf, my brother, and so on).
Cons:  With all the expansions (which are included in this edition) it's a bit long, and people often fall into Analysis Paralysis.

Overall I find I need to be in the mood to play it, unlike others in my collection that I'm always eager to play.

Excelente juego, yo en un principio pensé que era sólo azar el juego, pero la colocación de las losetas es sumamente importante, al igual que ver en qué parte de la loseta uno coloca el meeple, además acá en Chile es uno de los 2 juegos que tiene campeonato nacional y el nivel es muy competitivo.
En cuanto a la cantidad de personas me entretiene más jugarlo de a 2 o 3, ya que uno coloca más losetas y el bloquear lugares del oponente se hace más importante que cuando se juega de 4 o 5, ya que uno tiene que colocar menos losetas y no siempre se puede dar ese lujo.
Recomiendo sí o sí tener este juego en cualquier colección, es fácil de jugar y no dura mucho.

Tile laying at its best. Very good in families so every one can play together. Gamers will use one or more of the many expansions. While the first is indispensable others are. But it's all up to personal taste. One of the few German game of the years where there is no discussion about if it deserved the award or not.

RATING: 10
Played 10+ Scoring is contrived and the Meeple placement is often fiddly. I enjoy this game now I am familiar with the mechanics. How well you do is more influenced by your own play than the actions of the other players. A novice or even an intermediary player can be left feeling like a spectator when playing with experts, this is not a criticism, it is a joy to watch the pros at work, locking your meeples into unfinishable cities and worming into lucrative farms. I prefer Hunters & Gatherers but hats off to the original. *UPDATE* I am playing this game a lot at the moment with my gamer friends. The clean graphics and a better knowledge of the tile set have increased my rating. Sept 05

Cute, easy to play game. There isn't much to it, which I know is part of the appeal for some people in my group, but is somewhat lacking to me.

An excellent game, easy to learn and best of all my wife loves this game and will play it anytime I pull it.  always plays great for 2 to 4 players.  

I am changing the rating of this game from 9 to 10.  

The only flaw I can see in this game is once you add the expansions to the game separating them out again is a little daunting. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very, very well constructed game. Other games may grab my attention more often, but I think this one will have a staying power matched by few. I really don't understand what others see as being so boring about it. A forgiving learning curve, elegant and deep game play, and a relatively short playtime make this an all-time classic. While I don't doubt some of the expansions are quite good, I really don't see them as being necessary. That said, the farmer scoring can be a little wonky, and Hunters and Gatherers is my preferred option, but the original is still one outstanding game.

My first Euro.  Ironically, despite the seemingly benign geographic theme, this is one of the most cutthroat games that we have.  Stealing control of farms, making cities more difficult to complete, piggybacking on opponent's cities are all great ways of saying "take that."  

Downgraded my rating from 7 because I'd much rather play some of my higher rated games.

My 21 month old daughter loves to "play" this.  She asks for "Cahcahsonne" very frequently.  Typical turn consists of me asking her whose turn it is, then that person picking up one tile ("Just one tile, ok?").  If it's me, I play it somewhere.  If it's her, I give her a suggestion.  If it's Pooh Bear (a frequent Carcassonne partner around here), see previous.  She doesn't quite understand that tiles need to match on all side.  Game is over when she loses interest and stomps on the pieces (we play on the floor).  That's another positive...pieces are durable and setup/cleanup is quick!

Fun, light, easy to play but hard to win. I own the Big Box which came with Inns and Cathedrals, Traders and Builders, and some mini expansions, as well as Princess and the Dragon and the Tower. The game plays great without any expansions, and can change significantly depending on which ones get added in. I would advise against playing Princess and the Dragon and Tower in the same game; they greatly decrease scoring chances for everyone.

Carcassonne was the first game that got me into designer games quite a few years ago. It has a classic eurogame theme and feel, which goes like this:

"Wanna play Carcassonne?"
"What's that?"
"It's a game where you build a medieval French town."
"Sound awful."

And then you play it, and then you love it. Classic

A light game with more then 2 players. A great game to introduce to non-gamers especially when they only know Monopoly, Risk, etc (you know the list), because this introduces the German system. Instead of archiving a certain goal, here you win by collecting (the most) points.
But the real beauty comes when you play this game mano-a-mano.

Play a tile, place a meeple (if you have one), take a tile.  Artful.  Farmers, plus the king and the scout if you have them, offer some strategic options while tile positioning consumes players in a tactical struggle for points.  Recommended for everyone.

I keep forgetting how much I love this game.  This game is old (by board game standards) but it still holds a great place.  Every time I have brought it out again I have not been disappointed.  One of my favorite things about it is the absurdity that it creates.  You finally look at this medieval landscape and you see roads that just lead you in circles, cities that are the most strange creations, and 5 monasteries all side by side.  It's hilarious, but it lends itself to a strangely beautiful picture and I love it.

Świetny gateway do świata gier. Gra prosta do wytłumaczenia i prosta do grania ale wymagająca odrobiny strategii. Nikogo nowego raczej od grania nie odstraszy. Gra niestety po pewnym czasie zaczyna się nudzić a jej kolejną wadą jest zbyt mała liczba płytek do gry w 4 i 5 osób. W takim przypadku aby rozgrywka nie była zbyt krótka należy zaopatrzyć się w rozszerzenia.
Dla osób które poznały już bardziej złożone gry Carcassonne będzie trochę zbyt proste co nie oznacza wcale, że się do niego nie wraca. Wręcz przeciwnie raz na jakiś czas można zagrać a mieć warto choćby po to żeby kogoż porwać w świat gier.

2 player thrashing Steve (or vice versa)every lunchtime for 1 year and a half. hundreds of games 3 or 4 or 5 player. All good. Strategic poaching of their Cathedral cities but play with two tiles not one, cos otherwise it's just too random and no strategy/skill.

Lots of fun. Easy-to-learn tile-laying with the original meeple placement. Collecting complete--I have more Carcassonne than I could ever want, so am done with expansions. Have made my own "Ultimate Carcassonne using only my favorite components/rules from other expansions. Inns & Cathedrals is the only "must have" expansion in my opinion. But I also own The River, The River II, Count of Carcassonne, Inns & Cathedrals, Abbey & Mayor, Traders & Builders, The Princess & The Dragon, and The Tower.

I can see why many people like this game, it's quite analytical. But I find it pretty boring, and surprising luck driven as I constantly wait for a tile I can use. Works better with a "hand" of tiles, but I still don't find it that exciting.

Probably the very first Euro I ever tried.  Always a pleasant experience and one of my top gateway games.

RATING: 8
Meh.  As far as gateway games go, I'd take Ticket to Ride, Pandemic, or Catan over Carc any day.  Maybe more plays and some more cutthroat opponents would help out, but I think the expansions will be the only thing that encourages me to bring this to the table with anyone except complete board game novices.

Just tried this with my fiancee's family, so 5 of us, and it was great.  I mean, it wasn't the deepest gaming experience, but it was great to introduce this to people and get such a great reaction from them.  Gateway game FTW.
---
I now see why this game is so tremendously popular.  It's a great gateway game, but plays very well as a richly competitive 2 player game as well.  The expansions just add more seasoning to the mix, if and when you want it.

A favorite tile placement game; nice and elegant system.

Very nice naive art.

Great cut-throat game for 2-3 players.  With more, it becomes more focused on cooperation and collusion, but in a good leechy way.  A clever design of risk management, probability, and manipulation wrapped in a deceivingly calming pastel package.

RATING: 10
The game that got this hobby started for me (bonus points!!). It led me to check out a nearby game group and discover many more great games. Carcassonne however, to me, is still as brilliant a game as ever...

It has simple, easy to grasp rules and scoring that are very intuitive. It has a quick set-up of really only two components: the board tiles and the meeples. Or, really, setting-up is the game.  

Note: Also taken into account are the expansions Inns & Cathedrals and Traders & Builders, brilliant additions to a brialliant game.

My ideal "gateway" game.  Carcassonne is explained in minutes, played in an hour or less (without adding a ton of tiles), and expansions can be easily added or removed for seasoning.

While this may be a good gateway game, it´s nothing that will get me to the table again. By having only 1 tile each round, this is extremely luck-based, close to be a game of chance.

Excellent light tile-laying game.  Probably a better "gateway" game than Settlers of Catan since it plays great for two players and does not require bartering/negotiation.  

Not too complex in terms of strategy or analysis.  The land/tile placement and resulting player interaction are big draws.  Balance and luck quibbles is problematic only to more hardcore gamers.  

If you want to tweak this game for more complexity then buy some other expansions.  But know that with each one it bogs down slightly, and increases the fiddliness.  

Better yet, buy the stand-alone Hunters and Gatherers version of this game, which is deeper, more balanced, and more for a seasoned "gamer."

Take two slices of suck, and spread sucknut butter and suckleberry jam.  Layer alternating slices of Processed American Suck and slowly roasted suck, add some pickles, and garnish with crisp iceberg suck.  This will yield a Suck Sandwich that sucks only half as much as Carcassone.

Pretty good game and fun for families.  The ideas are fun and the design is nice.  The only complaint I have for this one is although there is it can be a little heavy on luck.  I believe the better play will win most games as there is strategy and luck evens out, BUT the church tiles (not sure if that is the proper name but its what we call em, the ones that get points for each neighbor tiles) are disproportionately powerful.  Say in a three person game one person gets 3 one 2 and one 1.  The person with 1 surely will have a hard time to win versus the player with 3 if both are equivalent skill.

Great game. It's cheap compared to many games, but looks great and is simple to learn, plays smoothly and quickly, but has great strategy.

OK game but needs the expansions to really work- but that means that you lose the simplicity of the base game. Played it yesterday with all three major expansions (but none of the smaller ones) and my head hurt afterwards from thinking about all options all the time.

A nice light filler for us. Not enough meat on it's own to hold my attention but I'll play if someone fancies. Edit: My son showed an interest in playing this recently and it was good fun. It's rekindled the spark a little to the point I might just get the first two big expansions.

RATING: 7
Base game is simple, elegant and very easy to learn. Basically an alternative to doing a puzzle which is actually fun! Plethora of expansions out there - certainly no need to collect them all, but offers a nice variety to pick and choose based on what you find most thematically appealing.

Play this with Inns and Cathedrals, River II and a bunch of other random tiles with the wife. We've got over 150 plays and it's our go-to game if we want to play something but we're a bit tired. Also a game we can play with the TV on - many plays with Newsnight on while back in the UK.

Great game, have played many many (100 +) times and it never gets old.  Offset "chance factor" luck of the draw on cards by holding 3 tiles in your hand at a time instead of 1.  Some of the expansions are worth it and add a lot.  I like "Inns & Cathedrals", "Builder & Pigs" ones.  Don't like "the Tower" so much though i've only tried it once.

RATING: 4
A game unjustly hyped because you can get the missus to humour you and participate. 
No brain required for play, rulebook advises you to help others place their pieces then the one with the most VP's wins!! 
So def one to play with wifey, i.e. shit.

All other big box variations are basically the same game for total suckers who will happily throw away money.
I do have the poxy little river expansion however, but it was less than the price of half a 6X, so picked it up on an otherwise fruitless day in a game store, many many lifetimes ago. Improves things zero percent if i remember rightly

Fun little game that my wife and I used to play fairly frequently before we found Race for the Galaxy. Tile-laying isn't something we really like, but hey, it's a light game where you count up points, so those are always a good way to pass some time on a quiet evening.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An excellent game, at least for two players. Everyone loves the building aspects of the game and they hardly notice the genius inherent in the mechanics, which is genius in and of itself. Anyone who has played dominoes can learn how to play, but better, more experienced players always have an edge. I really like this one in two player because you don't have to worry about two other people sharing large cities or something, but even with 5 (or 6 with expansions) the strategies are very similar. Farming very often wins games, but the more you farm, the more you limit your options since you never get farmers back until the end of the game. And a single enormous completed city can net you many more points than one or even two farmers. Farming, unfortunately, is a bit too complicated and not visually intuitive, not to mention the 3 different sets of scoring rules based on the edition of the game. Lately, I have been less and less interested in playing this one though. It seems to really only shine in two-player as the more people you add, the more chaotic it gets. And there are just mechanics I like better than tile-laying.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Very enjoyable, simple game.  I get turned off by the sudden scoring swings that can occur when someone draws the perfect tile...  it makes the game *seem* more luck-based than perhaps it is.*** Updated (2008-05-28) - After playing a few hundred ranked games on XBox Live Arcade, I don't think I can fairly rate this anything lower than a 10, which is a significant jump from the 7 I had previously rated it.  There is a fair amount of strategic and tactical depth here that may not be apparent until you've played it several dozen times against some very good players.  I can't stress enough that this is my rating FOR 2 PLAYERS ONLY.  With three or more players my rating is significantly lower, starting at about a 7 and sliding downward as more players are added.

In Carcassonne Bin. We play this BIG. I have 2 base games and every expansion I could get my hands on. Even sent away to Germany for a Spielbox Magazine with the Plague expansion. WE LOVE THIS GAME!! We move furniture and play on the floor. We play all of it at the same time. ALL OF IT. We have a knapsack that we toss all the tiles into. We sprawl the map all over the place. Full games can take hours and scoring the farms at the end is a total headache but we LOVE THIS GAME!! We don't bother separating the expansions afterwards because we know we are going to play the whole thing the next time anyway.

The game that made me step out of "walk-around-a-course-games" and into the present/future with modular boards. 
Simple and great. If a game is based on how long time it takes to teach others, this is one of the best.
Of all the add-ons, I have The count and The princess and the dragon (and The river).
Princess & Dragon seems a little bit too messy if you don't play with +100 tiles. Otherwise the Dragon appears too often and slays almost every meeple.

Carcassonne was my first Euro (after Settlers), and it got played many times. Played nice, played mean. With 2, with 3, with 4, with 5 and 6 even. Always well enjoyed game by those participating. I eventually traded it away after it sitting in my collection unplayed for a a few years.

While it doesn't provide the type of depth that I usually look for in a game, the rule-to-depth ratio is generally nice (once everyone 'gets' the farming rules). It's fun, it's fast - and an aesthetically pleasant experience. Of all the Carcassonne versions that I have played so far, it has my favorite aesthetics for the tiles (with the City having my favorite overall aesthetics).

Fun game that Casey Peterson introduced me to at a board game evening several years ago. The basic set is probably by far my favorite way to play. The expansions throw in some interesting flavor.

Tile-laying at its best. This one always feels like a puzzle where you are always looking for just the right piece. The farmers add a different kind of challenge. I love the scalability of this one. No farmers, or add The River, or any one of countless expansions. This makes Carcassonne it highly replayable. Plus, it is so fast-paced, you can get multiple plays in. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Non-gamers seem to dig it. It is sort of pretty to look at, and you can hold conversations during play. In an introductory capacity it works well, but in most other cases I'd pick something else.

Knock 2 rating points off if played with the rules as written for table talk-- you must show your tile and have other players comment on it? Thanks for the input guys, but I'd just as soon burn the game as play it again that way.

This game is one of the most balanced games I've ever played. By balanced I mean that it meets a lot of the criteria for being;

A. FUN!
B. Playable in a reasonable amount of time (if anything, a bit too short)
C. Playable from 2-5 without any major penalites
D. Highly variable between games
E. Easy rules but with ample room for strategies
F. Overall good balance between strategy and the luck factor. I say this because some have knocked it because of the luck of the tile draw, however, I feel if you don't limit yourself by focusing on completing one segment, or using one type of strategy, you can offset bad tile draw.

One of, if not, my favorite game of all time.  This is the game that brought me back to board gaming and I will play this anytime I get the chance.

It is a simple game with a brilliant set of mechanics.  Anyone can pick this game up and have fun.  Some of the best games are those amongst new players (with an experienced player to guide the action).

Add in the dozens of expansions which all are compatible with the base game and this is just a masterpiece in my book.  I fully plan to play Carcassonne and it's expansions until the day I die.

Carcassonne is a simple tile placing game to learn, but has some decent strategic depth at the same time (think Chess in this regard).  While there is certainly some luck involved regarding the tile you draw, it really comes down to what you *do* with that tile and how you use your followers that makes the difference.

Now that I have many of the expansions, I could never return to play this by itself, but at the same time, I do remember initially enjoying the game when we were first playing this by itself.

Note:  My wife normally plays all games with my son and I, but she was not into this one.  In fairness to the game, she did not give it a fair shake, as she only played one game (and we were learning as we went).  Still, this was one game that was not her cup of tea.  Therefore, I have only played this as a 2-player game, and very much enjoy it as 2-player (although I would think adding another player or two would make it that much more interesting).

In any case, overall, it is a game enjoyed by my son and I, but we now have included many of the expansions.

New to gaming so this is new to me, and each time i play it i gain a new appreciation for the game. Gorgous and creative. If i have a caveat i think i prefer the game at 3 than 5 as the latter can lead to a bunch of nickel and diming as opposed to gambling you'll get the exact tile you need.

Awesome gate-way game. No doubt about it.
I'd say "THE" tile laying game that's out there.

Super simple, super easy, nice artwork. I always like area control. Not too many decisions to overwhelm you & it even has a tad of theming.

I'd recommend to play with the rule that players can look at their next tile as soon as they placed theirs. That way downtime is reduced greatly.

A great, fast, and easy game with a strategy. no set up, just play. Expansions add variety but aren't always necessary. I enjoy using Princess and the Dragon, Traders & Builders, and Inns & Cathedrals expansions. But I do separate some of the expansions out so I can decided whether I'd like to add them or not.  

After 20  plays, the game will get boring without expansions.

With all the expansion, you lose a bit of the charm of the game. The princess and the dragon changes the game the most. 

We also play the app often.

This game gets into the table quite often as a warmup or last game of the day. I like the mechanics as we are building the map and putting down some meeples on it. It can be very competitive towards the game end when we are fighting for fields. It can be played in a really aggressive manner where you are just like a parasite goes into the castles every time, that i love to do so.

Pros / Cons:
-Always different, it has huge replayability.
-Very good warm up game.
-Modified rules made the luck less important.
-It can be played around 30-45 minutes, good to play with 3-5 players.
-Price / Value is really great, it is hard to get bored with it.

-Without the modified rules the luck just kills the fun.

2 - 6 players, with I&C expansion (best with around 4 people or else it can drag)

Carcassonne rarely hits the table anymore.  Not because it is bad game, but I guess just because it is more of a gateway game and most people are more interested in playing other things.  I like playing with Inns & Cathedrals, but the other two expansions I have add too much time in my opinion.  I want to try Traders & Builders again though.

Lowered from a 7 to a 5.  This change is mostly in light of finding Drakon.  Drakon has a similar feel - laying down tiles to make a modular board and using your player (meeple) to get coins (VPs) from said tiles.  Yes, this is only a fundamental similarity but it's a very strong one in my mind.  Drakon also lacks the stupid amount of randomness that Carcassone has - draw one tile and play it makes it difficult to formulate any plan.  Drakon's hands of 4 tiles that can do a variety of different things gives you a lot of room for planning/scheming.  I also hate the strategy of 'backdoor farming'.

Basically I suppose if I were offered the choice between Carcassone and Drakon, I'd pick Drakon hands down, every single time.  Also when talking gateway-level games, Ticket to Ride and Pandemic are far superior, really giving this game no place of particular interest for me.

This could be a truly great game, but it's almost totally ruined by the stupid Farmer scoring. I started with 1st ed. scoring rules in the RGG big box, which seemed unintuitive and easy to screw up. Knowing that I must be doing something wrong, I checked out BGG. I found that the farmer scoring in the US version of this game uses a methodology long discredited on the continent. So I moved on to 3rd ed. shortly thereafter. Although different, the kludgey farmer scoring is still counter-intuitive, easy to screw up, and very difficult to explain to casual gamers.

At first I rated this a "9", but it has steadily fallen each time I find myself muttering, "frakkin' farmers!"

I didn't actually like this game the first time I played it, as I thought the field scoring was not very good.

And I do like the random, and this game does not disappoint there.

This beautiful little game ends up with a pleasing map at the end of the game.  It is a great family game for all ages, and can be simplified for younger members (by leaving out the farmer).  

It is more an activity to have with conversation than a serious game. The expansions add a little more strategy, but the game still revolves around significant luck.  While I play it a lot, it is not a game I suggest when I am with serious gamers.

I haven't acctually played this a lot, but when I have I've enjoyed it. One thing though bugs me about this one (although it's a thing that can affect other games too). That's if people are spending too much time thinking their moves. Game can start to drag because of that and I see this game as a fairly quick and simple one, so this annoys me. Maybe that's why I haven't played it so much. But if played in a good pace, this is a really good tactical game.

Some plays are with expansions that my brother owns.

“If you build it, he will come.” - Shoeless Joe Jackson

GAMEPLAY
Player take turns laying connecting city, road and abbey tiles to build the city of Carcassonne. A player turn consists of laying a tile and deciding wether to place a meeple. As the city grows, the meeples claim cities(as knights), roads(as thieves), cloisters (as friars), and farms(as farmers). Completing each will give points during the game and return the meeple to the player’s hand. Unfinished areas are scored at the end of the game. Points are totaled and a winner declared.
COMPONENTS
The whole game consists of 72 tiles, 40 meeples, and the scoring track. All of the pieces are of high quality. The tiles are thick and hard which is important because they are handled so much. The meeples are painted wood and feel good in your hand.
THEME
Carcasonne is one of the important games of modern board gaming. Meeples have become an icon of gaming. The meeples and the art style work well together but this game could be re-themed to suit many eras.
WHO IS IT FOR?
This is a great game for families and is familiar to so many that its a good way to start your gaming session. Because there is little to keep track of, its fun for younger players from 8 and up. Games last from 30 to 45 minutes.

There is a wonderfully implemented ios version of Carcassone. Play locally or online. Also there is a solos version of the game with a set stack of tiles. Scores are based on how few tiles necessary to complete cities and roads.

One of my first Euro games. Too simple for my tastes. Couldn't convince my newbie friends either. Got them hooked with Power Grid and Puerto Rico instead. Probably time to find a new home for this copy...

Update (08/17/10): Found a gamer with 8 to 10 year old kids who LOVE this game. Glad it finally found a home to future gamers, where it will be loved.

Update (01/20/12): I'm never going to play this ever again. It may be an important and significant design, but I just don't care. There are much better gateway games than this, IMHO. Dropping it to a '2' from a '5'.

RATING: 7
Carcassonne is a good addition to any board game collection because it's easy to learn, quick to play, and can be played with only two players. It fills a nice niche as something you can play on a whim when you've got some time to kill.

Unfortunately, I don't find the game itself to be that wonderful. The game is a mix of luck and strategy, but I find it's too far on the luck side. I also find that the game has balancing issues. I've played over ten times now and I still don't see any compelling reason to play robbers as a significant part of your strategy. The lack of penalty for not completing a road or cloister doesn't help the balancing issue in my opinion. 

I think the funnest part of the game for me is the cat-and-mouse game of trying to secure farm lands, but it's a strategy that more often than not does not pay off (even if you manage to secure them), so it's hard to justify engaging in it.

All in all the fact that the game fills a nice niche means that I'm rating it higher than I would just for the gameplay.

RATING: 8
[b]tl;dr[/b] — Potentially light and mild, it's a great social game when played in 30ish minutes, but sags if it goes longer.  Expansions are the seasoning and so should be used sparingly to create the game that suits your current mood.  Terribly cruel when played to win, though.

[microbadge=10153]

Neat for what it is, a kids' game that can be played for blood (farm wars, anyone?).  The vanilla version is a pleasant-enough pastime.  Where [i]Carc[/i] really shines, though, is as a game system—the mix 'n match expansions allow you to complicate or flavor the game as you will.

UPDATE:  Revising down from a 7 to a 6.  This was shockingly novel at first, being only the second Eurogame I'd ever seen, but now...  And another thing:  The 8,000,000,000 different farm-scoring schema make for bizarre parallel-dimension gaming where some people at the table have evil goatees and some don't, leading to the disastrous overlay of competing realities, some where farmers lie on their backs and gaze at duck-shaped clouds scudding by and others where you can only get promoted by stabbing your boss in the neck.*

[size=7]*So, 12 years later, it looks like this has settled down—the standard seems to be German 3rd Edition rules with "farm-centric" scoring of cities for three points each.  I like the simplification—as well as the change making the tiny two-bit mini-cities worth four points instead of two, eliminating a rules exception, always a good thing.[/size]

UP-UPDATE:  This is the game that made me realize that most expansions are crap—they just add plaque that calcifies a decent game into an immobile, spiky mess.  (Or, to go to the other extreme, bloats it out so it can't even wear pants anymore.)   Expansions, in general, are a terrible idea unless:

a) It was a part of the original game (as designed) that got peeled off to make the base game simpler/cheaper,

b) Actually adds an element that enhances repeat plays, or

c) Fixes one or more broken elements that really shoulda been caught during playtesting.

Only three expansions for [i]Carc[/i] fit any of that—[thing=2591]The River[/thing], [thing=2993]Inns & Cathedrals[/thing] and [thing=5405]Traders & Builders[/thing].  Everything else is dessicated mummy-crap.

UP-UP-UPDATE:  Resurrecting this as a mild social activity; as a [i]game[/i] game it gets a 5, when consumed as a small bowl of whipped cream it's a 6.  The deal with the expansions is to understand that every tile added into the mix is another turn—and if you've got multiple axes to consider (with several expansions at once) then those turns can become very long indeed.  The game works best when it comes in well under an hour; it [i]wants[/i] to be short.**  I can honestly only see using one expansion at a time...

[size=7]**The closer to 30 minutes the better.[/size]

I forgot what an awful little game this can be:  so much grief, so many ambitious building projects that will never be completed, so many farmers stabbing each other in the tummy with pitchforks from the backs of rage-donkeys.

I'm not sure how the rest of world plays this, but man, we are just plain [i]mean[/i] to each other.

[i]Me likey.[/i]

UP-UP-UP-UPDATE:  Back up to a 7 where I expect it to stay.  When grokked and played accordingly—as a shortish social activity with one big and maaaybe one small expansion at a time it's a pip.

[b]CODA:  GROINS IMPLY BOOTS[/b]

The sheer ruthlessness required to play the game competitively is entirely at odds with the presentation:  cutesy li'l squares of bucolic cartoons, and the meeples themselves, adorable and nonthreatening, the very symbols of "points without pain" Eurogaming.  If the package reflected the truth of it the art would be dark and violent:  fields strewn with fresh grave-mounds, dangerous roads to nowhere festering with spleen-stabbing thieves, sprawling slums with gaping holes in the walls patrolled by gangs of baby-stomping kingsmen.

This is what you must do to win:  sucker your opponents into fights that you either dominate or walk away from (leaving them overextended), place tiles to ensure their followers are trapped in projects that will never be completed, and never share points unless you are so far ahead it doesn't matter... and even then, hook yourself in for +1 at the last minute to steal the "joint effort" for yourself.

You must crush dreams, snap their bones and suck the marrow.  You must be prepared to engineer fallen crests and hopelessness.  I'll be honest:  I felt like a complete jerk at first, as playing to win in [i]Carc[/i] is really about [i]making everyone else lose[/i], and the constant pooping in the punchbowl can suck the fun right out of the party.  But if you wish to do your best then that tile [i]must[/i] be placed where it maximizes both personal gain [i]and[/i] does the most harm to your opponents.

In the end the countryside puzzle we are constructing is a façade that does nothing to conceal the suffering of the nameless, numberless peasants who are too small to see from our lofty perches of intrigue.

[i]Carcassonne[/i] is an assassin in clown paint.

This is really a great game.  It plays well with two and up to six (although it is a very different game at those two extremes).  You can play it conflict free or somewhat nastily (although you are never going to be able to wipe someone else out like some people want from a game).

It's a great game for playing with board game neophytes or with kids.

After reading all the raving reviews and praises written by other players about Carcassonne I finally decided to give the little devil a try. And heck, "the sceptic in me was shot to death". When Carcassonne was first released, I hated the way the little pawns looked. I considered it too childish for my tastes and I actually kept ignoring the whole game until now. So, what did I miss eventually? A damn fine little game. Carcassonne bounced right up to the top of my favorite games -list and I am so anxious to play it again... and again... and again.

My first real addiction and played loads early on.  Preferred to the other great gateway of Catan thanks to the greater emphasis (or at least perceived on my behalf) on skill over randomness to create the winner.  

I love that (outside of farmers) it's an easy and quick game to teach, but that the mastery of it is much more complex.

Its hard not to love Carcassonne. Great for two players, greatly expandable and very simple to pick up. It's one of the few games we play where I can't think of any major downsides, other than something needing a fairly large and flat surface on which to play.

RATING: 9.15
Carc is great with any number of players and is a great gateway game.  

We don't play the farmer rule because it's hard to explain and swings the points too much in the end giving advantage to experienced players over newbies.

We also always play with river and inns and cathedrals.

Good classic game! Don't let whoever teaches you this game add too many expansions or it'll make you HATE this game cause you won't understand it. My first game was with ALL expansions and everybody but the owner of the game were newbies. The result was that we all ended up hating the game very hard (it took and eternity and we didn't know what we were doing)and never got played again. After some years I got to play it with a different gaming group, we just played the base game and we all liked it very much. Good to play with non-gamers.

RATING: 6
Unlike a lot of people on BGG I don't hate this game. Then again, my primary exposure to it is 2-player on Xbox Live where the computer handles all of the scoring.

It seems like the game would become dramatically different if you actually knew the tile distributions (I do not) and become far more strategic. I play it more as a city-building game with some marginal attempts at scoring well, which is probably how most other casual players play it.

최근 많은 시리즈가 나오고 있는데 점점 카르카손 본연의 재미에서는
좀 멀어지고 있는 것 같아서 아쉽다. 

개인적으로 가장 좋아하는 확장판은 "공주와 용" 이며,

Carcassonne is a great game.  It is the game that got me into playing games again.  I'm so glad the store owner recommended this one.  My 12 year old son especially loves this game.  It is a fantastic gateway game.  The tile laying is so unique, interesting, and fun.  It's kind of like a puzzle.  There are also plenty of opportunities to be "mean" in this game, stealing other players' cities.  Carcassonne plays best with two people.  The expansions make the game even better.  I would give it a 10, but I have grown tired of it.  I've played at least 20 or more games (before I started logging games played).

Got it for my 2009 b-day. It's nice tile placing game, simple, easy to learn, the rules were badly translated to portuguese from the spanish rules, which in turn were already horribly translated from an older version of the rulebook.

This game is the reason I am back into board games.  While my GF (now wife) and I were traveling in Wales, we stopped by a game store to see if there was something we could play at night in the youth hostel we were staying at.  The store owner suggested Carcassonne and what a great suggestion it was.  We played it a lot for a couple of years until we started playing other games.  We don't play it very much at all any more, but I think we both would play it if asked.  I think I also killed it when for Christmas, I bought 4 different expansions all at once.  Now, when we do play, we generally only use one or two of them.

I prefer to reduce the farm scoring just because that to me is where analysis/paralysis comes into play.  It can get downright nasty and dreadful trying to work out the best way to take over the fields.  When introducing it to new players, I don't even do the farm scoring at all in the first game.

Will play this anytime. Love the mechanics. This game started out in my gaming group as a friendly social game. No one played to hinder anyone else. If one person was in a city already, we tended to stay out. Then one day we saw one of our group play some meeples in some extremly hostile ways towards other people trying to gain points. When he won, everyone's eyes were opened and the game is now one of the most cut-throat games we play. It is in my opinion that most people who dislike this game or think that it is just ok, are still playing this way to friendly. Hunters and Gatherers is much tighter though, and makes it a better game than the original.

2-5 players, 60 minutes.  It's just not my type of thing.  It looks pretty once the game is finished & I'd be interested in playing another game on the final board that involved some type of intrigue & moving between the various locations to complete some objective.

However!  As time goes on I find myself needing a game like this in my collection ... so I'll keep it.

(Also, I've decided to play 3e rules: 4pts for 'football' cities & score each farm at game end - they're worth 3pts per completed adjacent city.)

We play Carcassonne at lunch time when running our school holiday program, Kraftworks for Kids. The program is for kids aged 9 - 14. The kids really enjoy this game. We pair up the beginners with one of the Leaders while those who have played a few games are able to play without assistance. Sometimes we don't finish the game by the end of lunch but it can easily be resumed at the end of the day while waiting for parents to arrive. Sometimes we use the expansions but this tends to make the game go longer. Lots of fun -- probably our favourite game!

RATING: 8
I don't know why, but I always find this game incredibly relaxing for some reason. As with all games based on a blind draw, you're restricted to using judgement to determine the best play. It helps to be thoroughly familiar with the tiles and winning a valuable feature is all about combining nearby tiles such that your men form the majority. Be sure to use the 3rd Edition rules as these balance the farmer scoring much better. In all, a pleasant light game that's undemanding enough to appeal to just about anyone. 
Be warned though, Carcassonne has been much diminished by over-expansion. One large or a couple of the smaller expansions are all that you need, anything more and what should be a pleasantly light diversion turns into an analysis-paralysis monster.

My first contact to the tile-placing game gengre. It's nice once in a while, but I have played it a bit too much and it is a bit too overly random and long for my taste, especially with all the additions (this referring to the game length).

Okay, new review time - old one below for posterity.

Yes, this game is okay for introducing new people to games, particularly if they are older. But the Farm scoring is a real issue in my mind, and these days I think the mass expansion sprawl probably makes it too long for the strategic depth it offers.

Iconic, but just buy a box then move on.
_____

The definitive game to introduce people to modern board games; it's a pity that the scoring is a little complex. It's actually great game with the dozen or so expansions thrown in, if you can sit through the time it takes to play that long.

My main gripe is that the 2nd edition farm scoring is a lot more balanced than the 3rd, but a fair bit more complex.

I've only played this game once, but I completely understand the hype. The game is very simple -- flip a tile to create the board, place your Meeple on an incomplete road or fort, and claim your points. I usually like heavy, complex games, but this game was refreshingly simple but with enough strategy to keep the game on its toes. Will likely buy soon!

I wish I owned the expansions (I only have the base + river/abbots). This is one of my favorite gateway games. There's zero set up time and the rules are simple to teach to almost any one. It doesn't really get stale and there's a fun bit of luck involved (as there should be imo with family games to ease the tension and create hilarious circumstances). I see this game staying at the top 200 for years to come as long as the hotness doesn't bring it down.

Definitely classic: Being enough strategic with extremely simple rules, although a little bit plain.

Carcassonne has the right balance of strategy (a lot) and random luck (some, but not too much). It's a number cruncher where the points DEFINITELY matter. As the game comes to a close, it becomes a mad dash for players to score points in whatever way possible. A keeper in my collection for sure.

Can be played very strategic and competative or to relax, no matter how old your co-players are. Just look closely if you add expansions. Some are an extension of the existing mechanic (grab a randome piece and build) others add further random elements, which takes away player skill and makes it more prone to luck.

Great strategy game that is really at its best when players are moderately experienced. Very easy to learn/teach.

-------------------------------

[i]Carcassonne[/i] is a tile-laying game that plays in 45 minutes and is very easy to understand. You place a tile, and then you place a ‘follower’ on a feature on the tile, with the aim of ‘completing’ features to get points. The game plays 2-5 people, and is probably better with fewer players; achieving the best results at the minimum of 2. As you add more players, the ratio of decisions to time decreases dramatically, and can become quite boring, as this a game that can be prone to analysis paralysis.

I wouldn’t call this game for everyone, as it can wear out rather quickly I find. Even though the large amount of tiles and combinations seem exhaustive at first, the games seem to repeat themselves rather often, and by that I mean that they seem the same, even though they are not. This is due to the lack of interesting decisions in the game it around the 10-20 plays mark. Even the limited player conflict cannot prevent this from occurring. The one exception to this is the two player game, which I find to be rather tense under the circumstances; however it also feels rather repetitive.

The actual gameplay itself is dictated by luck, but sufficient contingency planning should be able to eliminate this, but it is still not uncommon for an experienced player to lose to a newer one on luck alone. For the first couple of plays, it may seem like there is little interaction, but many people discover the method of interfering with other people’s plans fairly soon. Towards the end of the game, the completion of your features and the placing of your farms gives the game a nice tense atmosphere, but as noted above, this does not remain for too many plays.

To conclude, [i]Carcassonne[/i] is a fun game for the first few times you play it, and is good for introducing new people to the world of gaming, but I would not dwell on it too long, at least, not without the expansions. Also, try to stay away from games with more than four players, as they can get boring very quickly unless someone is marching the game through at breakneck pace.

[b]Pros[/b]
- Simple to teach and learn
- Good gateway game
- Equal opportunity to win
- Plenty of expandability

[b]Cons[/b]
- Lacking in continued playability
- Analysis paralysis prone 
- Decisions lose interest after a while
- Games feel the same quite often
- Lack of accommodation for large numbers of players

We always play this game with Traders and builders and Inn's and cathedrals. We always play it as mean as possible. Our gateway game.

Update 2011: we still play it with inns and catherals but no other expansions anymore. Our favorite game for two gets played a lot more this way.

Really enjoy this game.  First game that hooked me into boardgames again (damn you, Tyler).  Consequently, I've used it to hook many others into a regular game and have probably helped put Klaus-Jürgen Wrede grandchildren through University as other friends have bought Carcassone, too.

Nice Light Game.  Plays quickly if you have a group of experienced players.  This game is easily learned by new players.  There is a lot of luck (random draw of tile) but stragegy plays a part in where you play the tile.  The expansions add more rules and more tiles.

As a stand alone base game, I think Carcassone is very solid.  However, once you throw in a few expansions, the game goes to a whole new level and easily becomes a '10' in my book.  The best part is you can add certain combos to flavor the experience to whatever fits your mood (confrontational, big group, two-player).  I love my toolkit games and it's hard to hide.

I struggle to rate this higher since it has such a niche place in my collection. I've almost exclusively played it two player, and almost every play has been with my wife. I truly enjoy our games together as much as almost any other game experience I have, but I don't know how much of that is the game.

Carcassonne is beautiful, and it's a delightful experience to see the board slowly come together over the course of a match. The expansions are a lot of fun, and add some interesting wrinkles to the base game strategy.

Carcassonne can be annoyingly cutthroat. Optimal play can seem pretty brutal at times, and someone stealing a castle you worked on for many turns can feel pretty crappy. There is also a potential for large blowouts in cases of dissimilar skill. Thankfully not an issue I have much anymore, since my wife has learned the game well enough to routinely thump me.

All in all, I really enjoy Carcassonne, but I have such a narrow use for it that I'm not sure it deserves a higher grade. In the specific situation of two player games, with my wife, it's an 8 or a 9, but outside of that, I can't see it reaching that high.

No sleeves required.

I made my own tiles for this game, and people really enjoy the custom version despite the weight.  My friends have all sworn off of buying the thing (despite their rabid desire to play, and frequently!) and are each waiting semi-patiently for their hand-painted copy.  I'm sorry photos don't seem to be up yet, and that I'm neither a competent photographer nor much of a painter--but it didn't stop us from loving the homemade version of this game!  (Which, if you didn't know, is one of the best board games I know, ceramic or cardboard!)

Love the game.  A cornerstone piece of the game collection.

Inns & Cathedrals, Traders & Builders, and the River (or River II) are our preferred expansions.  I'm also quite partial to the Die Katharer expansion as well.

The Count expansion was OK, but added some confusion.  The "city" tiles from the Count expansion do make for a nice alternate starting set-up.  The King/Robber expansion scoring rules seemed superfluous, although we often use the tiles without the added rules.

Added note:  As much as I like this game, when you play with a full boat of people (i.e., 5 or 6 people) who all know how to play, it's more of an activity than a competitive endeavor.

RATING: 7
This game was one of my first purchases when I started collecting modern board games. I initially got it because my spouse has an interest in patterns and puzzles so this was an easy favorite for her. It's also been a game that I'm proud to show off. It's been my go to "gateway" game and I've even encouraged friends to get it. That being said, I find this game fun but it does not have enough confrontation nor player interaction for me. There is a passive aggressive side of the game where one player can block another player's feature or extend it without hope of finishing to score but I think games play better when everyone works on their own little corners. Also, with expansions come new features or rules which is nice, but it causes a lot of bloat to the game and increases play time. A good game but definitely not great.

This is a classic game.  It seems to work best with 2-3 players.  It's not always the easiest to explain to new people, which does hurt it's gateway status.  Maybe lacks a bit in extreme re-playability, but that's what the expansions are for.

This is the ideal game--if you only have two people, it&#039;s great, but it&#039;s probably best with three, and can play up to 5.  There&#039;s VERY LITTLE setup time involved, small amount of take-down, and requires a good amount of strategy with some luck.  It&#039;s fairly easy to learn, but a little bit tougher to learn the best strategy.  It&#039;s also quite affordable--I picked it up at a local game store for about $20.  I HIGHLY recommend this title.

I've upgraded my score in the past 6 months. I very much enjoy playing this now both in person and on BSW. I think there are quite a few ways to conflict with your opponents and I really like the expansion. The so-called luck element somehow doesn't seem to bother me.

Hard to really rate this game as a stand-alone since I will always play it with T&B and I&C. Without those it feels incomplete.

*UPDATED* - I've really gotten tired of this and my interest in it has waned quite a bit.

I give this game such high marks because it appeals to both me and my wife. That really says something, given our differences in gaming tastes.

I don't love eurogames, but some of them can give you good times. This game has little replay value, but it's just so much fun to fight for the farmers while making rivals castles big enough so they can't finish them, that it deserves a good rating. I played it with Inns & Cathedrals, Traders & Builders, The River I and The Princess & the Dragon, the last one without the rules, just for the tiles, and I rate the whole thing altogether. Inns & Cathedrals doesn't just add a rule and traders &.. two. The new tiles are more worth than the rules itself.

This is the only game I've seen which focuses only on topology. It has simple rules, big amount of randomness, but still very little luck involved. Beginner will almost certainly loose to experienced player, especially in 2-players game, which is my favorite setup. Mastering of strategy takes time and it is not simple game at all. Actually, it is very hard game with very simple rules. From my point of view, this is the best game ever, and everybody should give it a shot. I am not expert in pedagogy, but I would guess that Carcassonne will boost kid's logical and spatial skills.

I really like Carcassonne! It's a cool little game, plays well im all player counts, it's simple to learn, requires strategic thinking and can be taken easily during travel. Both me and my wife like it a lot, we played it also with one expansions. Hopefully we can try other expansions soon as well. Recommend to take it to the table for any occasion, especially for the non-gamers.

This is an easy game to play with all of the kids, but we don't play it as much as we use to. I guess its replay value is not too high after so many years. The smaller children, who may not earn the points to win, have fun putting the pieces on the board. It definitively feels like the luck of the tile is more important then any tactics. Overall, I'd rather play something else. Infact- I have tossed out all of the expansion tiles and only have the base game and 2 of the expansions now. A Nice game to take to GMA's house for the evening without worring about a child breaking it.

This is one of the very first Eurogames I got on my own after Settlers. I liked the idea of creating the game from tiles and having to connect those tiles together. Reminded me of a game I played as kid called Roads, Rivers, and Railroads but this game actually seemed to have a purpose.

Highly recommended game and very fun. It's what got me going down the road of board gaming even further.

Surprisingly interesting for such a simple game and very suitable for teaching to non-gamers. I very much prefer it with fewer players (ideally with only two) as this brings tactical play more to the fore and allows scope for sly tile placement. With a larger number of players, the outcome of the game depends too much on the luck of the tile draw (with 5 or 6 players I'd rate it a 6).

Very nice game, I enjoy playing it with family and friends from all ages (10 up, of course).
Easy to explain to new players if you don't add in too many extensions (although I always add the Inns & Cathedrals + Traders & Builders).  The tougher rule to explain might be the farmers, as I find quite some people who would rather skip that rule, I think the different crossings, bridges, small gaps, etc. Make it difficult for new players to really get it the first few times.

If you feel like a long game, have many extensions, and don't want to explain too much you can always skip any 'non standard' rules that are added by the extensions (I.E. Ignore the tower bases, vulkans, etc). That way you might cover your whole table with carcassonne tiles! :D

Tired of this and I was never that enamored with it. Funnily enough it was more fun when me and my friends played it with misunderstood rules.

It feels wearying and slightly mean in an opportunistic way without giving a good feeling about it.

I love this game.  It's fast moving, simple in its concept yet very strategic, and doesn't take too long.

I bought it when my daughters were 5 and 7.  They both understood the basics of the game, so I was able to play with them but they didn't understand the strategy (understandably).  My 5 year old (now 7) didn't like it after the novelty wore off.  My 7 year old (now 9) still likes it. My wife doesn't like this game because of the "screwage" factor, but enjoys it if I promise to play nicely.

Some notes:
~ The water expansion that came with my version is pretty good
~ The Farms element of the game is something I haven't introduced to my kids...it's a bit too advanced for them I think.  The game plays fine without playing Farms.
~ The quality of the tiles is fantastic, have held up 100% after about 20 plays
~ I like it best with 2 players.

Carcassonne (Old edition).

Note: I own a second copy of 'Carcassonne: The Phantom' with 'Meeple Stickers' by which the phantoms can serve as abbots as in the new edition of Carcassonne. The faire tiles of 'Carcassonne: The Catapult' can additionally serve as garden tiles (as in the new edition), even though there are three more faire tiles than garden tiles.

For other information on playing Carcassone with and without expansions, I have made a short overview (in Dutch) by which the party has to decide what rules apply, and I have saved two pages of 'Carcassonne - Complete Annotated Rules (Version 4.0):

Excellent with 2 players; the base game is a little imbalanced due to the poor value of roads, which are the most common piece. Inns & Cathedrals fixes this major flaw without adding too many new rules or mechanics. Much prefer using this as a gateway game rather than Catan due to more varied strategy, lack of dice, and interactivity in creating a board together / disrupting other people's strategies.

This is one of my favorite games. I love the tile laying, I love the Meeples, and I love the simplicity of the scoring. Okay, scoring of the farms can be a bit annoying if you're playing with the wrong person, but most of the time it's no problem and is a lot of fun. I also love that it's a quick game that I can get just about anyone to play. It's absolutely a must have game that will see consistent table time.

Excellent for beginners, but not only.  I really enjoy it although I usually prefer heavier games.

This is one of the newer most hyped games I have tried that fell completely flat. No strategy due to one tile at a time and very little tactical choices and did not find it fun at all. 

Very dry and boring, strictly tile-laying. Still would get played over some other low-level games but it won't be suggested. Reminds me of "waterworks" from what I remember only I think I enjoyed that more, at least you could throw a wrench in the guy's plumbing...

To be fair I'm sure this is somewhat better with the expansions and maybe a house rule letting you hold 2 or 3 tiles and maybe even picking from an open pool like El Cab but El Cab is far better (although EC is NOT a gateway game so they are pretty different in that respect).

I'm waiting to try "The City" or "The Castle" which looks better and more involved as straight tile-laying doesn't excite me a whole bunch (at least in this form where as in T&E it is masterfully beautiful). 

I can see why people like it for its simplicity and as a Gateway, for me a little too simple but with some tweaks it would be another good gateway tool.

The tile laying mechanic is ingenious.  The jigsaw puzzle-like board is assembled as the game is played (it's different every time).  Watching the medieval city unfold--in sometimes very strange ways--is fun and a distinctive part of the experience.  But there is a good game here, too.  Despite the placid theme, play can get quite chippy: you are frequently better off trying to foil or rob an opponent than enhancing your own holdings.  The luck factor is on the high side and increases with the number of players.  Except for the farms (which often cause problems for newbies) the rules and scoring are straightforward.

A great game that even non-gamers can enjoy despite the initially confusing farmer rules. I don't mind playing this over and over because despite playing this quite often, I still haven't tired of it much. It involves a good of luck with tile draws, but good players can often overcome this. I've heard this referred to as a mostly solo experience but it couldn't be further from the truth. When you can latch onto my buildings, roads, and farms, stealing points form other players...that's interactive!

Original. Very clean and elegant tile laying game from Hans im Glueck. The city of Carcassone is constructed by simply drawing a tile and positioning it on the ever increasing game "board". Players score points by playing their coloured pieces onto the played tile as a knight (in cities), farmers (on the green stuff), robbers (on roads) and clergyman (on monasteries). Points are maximised by enlarging the sphere of your piece. Timing is everything, as you only get your pieces back when you complete a sphere. Excellent game.

Update: Bought the Big Box version - which included all 5 expansions.  It was $35 at essex.

I'm a sucker for Carcassonne, but I usualy need at least the Inns & Cathedrals and/or Traders & Builders (preferably both) expansions in order to make the original game interesting enough to play these days. And the third edition German scoring rules are necessary to balance things out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
In Carcassone, you take turns drawing tiles that you then place on the board to build up a map with roads and cities and so forth.  After you place a tile, you can decide whether to place one of your limited supply of men on it to score some points.  It's a challenging game that requires little advance planning and is pretty quick.  It makes for a nice filler game.  I don't seek it out but I enjoy it when I play it.

RATING: 7
Most games start with high ratings from me, and decrease a point or so over time.  (Naturally - I'm always willing to play my newer games, and will usually suggest them, etc.)  This one, however, has creeped up slowly over time.  My first couple plays I was wholly unimpressed.  But the more I played it, the more I enjoyed the simple, clear-cut strategic decisions.  It might not be a brain-burner, but if I'm in the mood for something light that can be played in 15 minutes, this is probably what's going to hit the table (or floor, as the case may be.)

Update: back down to a 7.  Just not hitting the table much anymore . . .
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Carcassonne is a good gateway game, but it only continues to claim a spot in my collection because it is a really good two-player game. The more players, the more that the game slows down and the luck of the tile draw takes away from the tactics.

A regular for us, because it's minimal set up and easy clean up, and fun for two players.  The randomness of the tile draw negates a lot of strategy as most of the time you are just waiting for that right piece, which keeps it out of the 9-10 range.

Play this (mostly) on BSW... I like it a lot (with all expansions).

I now am playing it multiple times per week and it just grows on me more and more.  I'm bumping this to a 9 from my previous 8.

BSW convinced me to buy it and I now have it with all the expansions except for one.  It's a little more tedious to count up some of the end score, but it's still a lot of fun.

1/2011- I haven't kept up with all the expansions, but still a top notch game. 100 or so games played on BSW when I wasn't logging as well as 20ish IRL.

Carcassone is a good game, but it always seems a little slow and random to me. I think the core game is good, but to often the expansions make the game longer than it should be. If the game were always in the 30-40 minute range it would be better, but it always seems to take more like 60-75 minutes for us to play.

I'm getting tired of explaining the basic adjacency rule for meeple placement... and farmer scoring always seems to cause people headaches.

This is the game that I hate most of all games I ever played. The tiles and town or lawn building is cool, but it cannot mitigate the main flaw.
In all games, the grasslands were at the end all connected and all the profit went to someone that put a large stone on some other grassland and connected them. If the profit would be divided evenly, it eould be fair, but no. Everything to the winner.

Not unlike Dominion, the plays recorded here in no way represent the number of times I've played this game. This was the one game my boyfriend liked before I bought Dominion (he's starting to like more and more as he follows me down the rabbit hole). 

We took the base game (tiles and two sets of meeples in a Ziploc bag) to Paris when we went for a 2 week holiday. Now I rarely play it without Traders and Builders and after finally acquiring The River 2, it's coming back to the table more frequently.

A really easy game to learn. Strategy is obvious in the base game and I prefer higher strategy games. Hence I bought a number of the expansions. 

If you like strategy I would advise to buy at least the biggest expansions - Inns and Cathedrals as well as Traders and Builders.

The flip side is that if you have friends that do not like strategy games this is a good intro game to see if you can hook them in....

Initial Rating: 5.0 (July 2010)

It is a simple game, easy to teach and very good to attract non gamers to our beloved hobby, HOWEVER I don’t know why but I feel a deep hate for the game, I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT. There is no chemistry between us.

I know I´m being irrational but I have no desire to play this whatsoever. It is the only game I have vetoed in our game sessions and thus far I have not met other people who doesn’t like the game, guess I´m kind of alone on this one.

I feel the game is so boring (no theme at all) and it has annoyingly high luck. I KNOW there are a lot of variants and expansions that fix this but I will offer my utmost resistance against playing this again.

Current Rating: 2.5

I have at least 5 plays before 2010 thus I have not logged them.

The non-gamer game IMHO.  You can play while in a coma and still do okay.  Only competitive as a 2-player game.  Never play with more than 3 if you want any sense of control.

I have trouble caring enough to play this game seriously, but as a competitive puzzle it's not bad.  It was worth a good 10-15 plays before I finally lost interest.

As a game Carcassonne has a lot of the area-majority scoring mechanisms that I can't stand.  I prefer to just put the puzzle together and punt on the meeple decisions.  If that's the game's only function for me, might as well just play with a real puzzle.

Another game that I can get my wife to play so it automatically earns an extra point. In some ways it's hard to play the board game when the Xbox Live version scores so easily and automatically. If the iOS version had all the expansions, I'd probably never bring this to the table. I used to play with all the expansions but that's gotten to be almost impossible now that I have so many.

Best played offensively. Another early exposure to Euros for me. Thought it was boring at first, but after one 2-player game where both players were fighting over one large (50+ points) city made it 'click' for me. This game is evil. Really evil.

We always play with T&B amd I&C...makes the game so fun and addictive.  Gets to the table more than once a week because we always want a re-match.  Competitive, but relaxing after a long day at work.  Tried once with just the base game, and it felt flat.  Love with 2 players, maybe with 3...no more than that.

Always play with Traders & Builders and Inns & Cathedrals.  Also mix in the Phantom, King, Robber Baron.

Also own Scout, The River I and II, The Cult,  and Princess & Dragon, Abbey and Mayor, and Hills & Sheep.  Not sure how I feel about those yet.

My first few games of this, I didn't get it. I understood the game rules..I just didn't really see the fun. However, after a few more plays (my wife loved it immediately) I started to understand some more of the overall strategy and see some opportunities for mischief. It has since become a great favorite amongst even my rough and tumble collection of football pals. They love stealing properties from each other or what they call "backdooring". 

There's not a great deal of strategy to be had but for whatever reason we always have a good time and there is always a lot of laughter at the table when this comes out.

After many plays, this game is now officially out of the regular rotation.  I will only play with 2 or 3 players, as any more makes the game too lucky, and believe it or not, results in too much down-time between turns.

It's a very solid game. It goes well with just about anyone but again just like with Ticket to Ride or Catan series, theme might be much too dry to play - might lead to boredom. As such, you need to play this with the correct mindset or right people. 

I played this couple of times in the past, and want to own a copy for myself as well. Just a really good game for families.

Although the fun of Carcassonne depends a lot on the expansions that are used, this game is a true classic, it's good, it's fun, it's easily explained but has a lot of options on short and long term. Choose the expansions and their combinations wisely and it's ridiculously good.

Classic tile-laying game.  Get The River (comes in the box now, I believe).  Get Inns & Cathedrals.  Get Traders & Builders.

This one is the way to go.  Great game.

Fun game with easy rules.  Seemingly endless expansions keep Carcassonne fresh.

Update: So, I have pretty much all the expansions I'll get.  Carcassonne, while a good game in its own right, can bog down when expansions add tedium.  Carcassonne's strength was it's accessibility-newcomers could join and do pretty well.  But if you add Cult, Seige, Creativity, the King and Scout, the Count, the River I, the River II, Traders and Builders and Inns and Cathedrals . . . well, it gets to be too much.

That criticism aside; I still like Carcassonne.  I don't play it as much as I should.

Carcassonne was the first light strategy / euro game I played.  I haven't played many other tile-laying games to compare it to but it's fun and strategic.  Yet you can only work so much with a certain tile to benefit you or give you an edge in the game.  But a balanced combination of luck and strategy is what appeals to so many people, myself included.

The game that got us into modern boardgaming. Classic, easy, fairly quick, but with tons of depth and replay-ability. The rules are clear and easy to understand (with the exception of farmers, those can be hard for people to grasp the complexities of), and the turns go quick so the play is fast and engaging. I grab it if an inexperience gamer is coming, if we want something to play while watching a movie or cooking dinner, or if we just want to play the old standby that everyone knows. 

My copy is super worn out, and I will definitely buy another copy when necessary.

Carcassonne is the quintessential tile-laying game. It offers an array of choices with each tile and meeple placement. While some avenues seem more advantageous, there are many viable strategies and paths to victory. Very accessible for children and less experienced gamers. The base game feels a bit samey after several rounds, so expansions help considerably. A welcome title at my table anytime.

Um clássico. A versão base é algo limitada. Há uma regra implementada por muitos que melhora o jogo: invés de tirar um tile, ter sempre três na mão e poder assim optar. Deste modo já fica muito bom. No entanto, há algumas expansões (nem todas) que dão uma maior dimensão ao jogo. Chega a alcançar o que de melhor se pdoe encontrar a nível de jogos de tabuleiro. Com as expansões certas é de facto uma experiência formidável. Nesta versão base, já tem uma boa mecânica, rodando a ação à volta de encaixar peças umas nas outras e ir marcando pontos.

28.10.2009: I have tired a bit of this, but I still play it if others want to. The farmers are a dilemma though, many of the people I play with don't want to use them and the different rules version don't help. It's still a great introductory game, although the farmers are hard to explain before you've played a complete game. I've stopped buying expansions for this, the first three + a few of the small ones are enough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Excellent game.  Works much better with expansion tiles due to increasing length.  Will play lots with anybody.

It's a good game, but... it just never feels as fun as it should, if that makes sense.  Most of the tiles I draw are either impossible to place where they'd benefit me, or have a spot that's so obviously right for them that there's no decision to make.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The grandaddy of all tile placing games, it's survived for a reason: it's easy to learn, no two games are the same, and you can teach it easily to people of all ages. Simply draw a tile, place it where available, and choose whether to try and get points from it using your limited supply of meeples. Fun for the whole family!

BIG PLUS: relatively inexpensive for the amount of fun you get out of the box
BIGGER PLUS: big box editions contain mixtures of the expansions, many of which are worth playing
MINUS: eventually your gaming group will get bored with this game and move on.

SUPER PLUS: the iOS version of this game is well worth it as well. :D

My most played game if you count iOS plays. Love this game (with at least the first expansion and even better with the second as well. Even though the games get longer, they also seems to get more tactical than luck based as you expand)I rate the unexpanded base game a lot lower.

RATING: 6
Original game concept, I think this game deserves the attention that it gets.  There is a large luck component, but there is enough skill to keep it interesting.  Good strategic advice in this game cannot be easily communicated, it has more to do with 'feel'.  Two things I don't like about this game are the game length (especially when you add expansions), and the amount of table space required.  I suppose that Arkham Horror, which I rated an 8, suffers from these problems a lot more (even though it has no similarities to Carc.), but unlike AH, Carcassonne doesn't have enough character to make up for its deficiencies.  Still a good game, and great for beginners.

RATING: 6
I have the Big Box edition.

This score is based on the unadulterated base Carcassonne, which probably wouldn't hold my interest for more than a few games. The expansions add quite a lot to this game and the Big Box set allows for a lot of variety in a smaller package than owning the expansions individually. The Big Box as a whole I would give an 8 or 9. It's greater than the sum of it's parts.

Easily explained within 10 minutes. Non gamers like the tile laying aspect. There is a lot of luck involved, but there are also some strategic options involved. In contrast to many others, I don't see the one big field as a problem. Everybody knows its importance, so the battle for it is a fair one. (12 jan 08 after 21 plays)

This game has lots of fans out there, but I am not one of them.  The inherent luck factor in the tile draw is a key factor, as it most of the time, it seems you have very limited options as to what to do.  There are some variants (draw two tiles instead of one) and there's the light blue box version with only five meeples and you can place or pick up one of them, not both.  But, generally speaking, I am not a Carcassone fan.

RATING: 7
This is a classic gateway game that has stayed fresh with some good expansions. Though there are many expansions and not all are worth incorporating into the game. Game play can be fairly casual or more cutthroat. We play a blend, block each other and extend cities to be unfinishable without getting worked up about anything. We started playing the variant of having two tiles to choose from and play with one blank tile that can fit anywhere, but has to be played in a completely surrounded hole - a get out of jail free tile. I've never had anyone struggle with the farmer scoring (anymore than anything else), so have never left it out.

This was my first euro/modern boardgame purchase ever... Fall 2004, I remember well the moment.  I dig the strategy involved, and also the "art" that emerges during gameplay.  I love the process of laying the tiles.  The French medieval theme is perfect for me!  I really like how Carc is so flexible based on who you're playing, and what mood you're in - it works equally well in a cut-throat, strategic battle between two buddy gamers as it does a peaceful meditative session with family or less aggressive friends. It's thanks to this game that I discovered BGG and the wonderful universe of modern boardgames.

An easy game to appreciate. Not engaging enough with more casual gamers (who, of course, are drawn to it) and not a favorite with gamers (who make for a more enjoyable experience but usually select something else). My rating of this may go down to a seven with further play. 

Rating downgraded to a seven because I haven't played it in a year and I've no real desire to. Maybe it's time to check out "Inns and Cathedrals." There's nothing about Carc that's heavier or less random (with 3+ anyway) than Ticket to Ride, but for the moment I find TtR Nordic Countries and Switzerland to be my lighter games of choice. I may try to give this one a second look down the line; we'll see.

An excellent light game.  It has a positive feel (since you are constructing the board as you go).  A good gate-way game for non-gamers.  It becomes more involved as you add extensions.

RATING: 7
Prefer The City (Stadt) variant, but otherwise this is a great gateway game, which I would recommend over Settlers.  Player interaction is both competitive and cooperative, a dynamic which very few games can generate.  First-time players area little disadvantaged by not knowing the possible tile draws, but this is overcome in a few plays.  The thinking required is not highly intuitive at first (i.e. you need to master the concept of "getting in on" a feature by playing a meeple to an unconnected tile with the hope to connect later), but most players get there in time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Simple and nice to show it for beginners, but well... Though I like simple and easy games, this one just don't give me much fun and bores me. I find it nothing to e.g. Settlers of Catan. Carcassonne is overrated in my opinion.

I LOVE THIS GAME!!!  It has a very appealing factor in it's tile format--building the board as you go & placing meeps (my gaming group calls them "dudes") here & there for points.

Carcassonnne is a fantastic game and a true classic, but there are many ways to get a bad impression:

- Playing with too few expansions. You need Inns & Cathedrals and Traders & Builders to increase strategic options, balance scoring elements, and reduce luck.

- Playing with too many expansions. The River is the biggest offender as it comes with the game and encourages boring, non-interactive play. It also increases random luck and unduly increases playing time, which is the problem with several other expansions.

- Playing with too many people. It's best with 2 and not very good with 4 or more.

- Playing non-competitively. It's not a jigsaw puzzle. If you're not trying to trap enemy meeples, you won't win against someone who is.

RATING: 9.7
The very first game I bought after discovering the new generation of games.  Have since bought all of the expansions.  an absolutely wonderful game.  Not hard to learn.  Very strategic.  The first game I play with my friends to introduce them to board games.

Edit 12/5/08 - I've upgraded my rating of this game to a 10 after playing it quite a few times in the past couple weeks.  It's been gathering dust in the corner for a while now since I've been eagerly building up the collection and it's been ignored in favour of all the new games.  However, now that I've rediscovered it, I have to say it's a perfect game.  Especially when combined with one or all of the expansions.  We always play with "Inns & Cathedrals" and I would even recommend that "Traders & Builders" be used always as well.  I can't say enough good things about Carc's.  There's ZERO setup, quick game play.  Lots of tension and strategy.  Very easy to teach to new people.  And the more you play, the more cut throat it becomes.  
    The greatest game for so many reasons.  Better than Catan - too much luck, better than RRTycoon - too long to play and too long to setup.  A beauty.  It should be higher ranked on the geek.

Our other go-to gateway game. Rarely gets played when it's a group of 'gamers', as there always seem to be other games which are more attractive at the time. But when put in a social situation with people who haven't played many games beyond Monopoly, it still manages to please. Simple but still strategic in gameplay, scoring somehow manages to bewilder those new to the game; to the point that we essentially ignore the farmers unless we're playing with those who have played the game before.

Despite the fact that we rarely bring it out on its own, the plethora of expansions keep extending Carcassonne's life - breathing fresh air each time. As of this writing, we've only scratched the surface with one expansion. But it's nice to know that as time goes by, we can quickly and easily (and cheaply) keep the Carcassonne love going for a while to come.

El juego que me trajo a BGG. Tiene mecánicas novedosas (en su día) como el tile-placement y la puntuación mediante meeples. Me sigue apeteciendo jugar de vez en cuando.

Del orden de 50 partidas sin loguear.

UPDATE: Nuestra combinación de expansiones favoritas es el rio, el rio II, la mini expansion, posadas y catedrales, constructores y comerciantes, y el dragón y la princesa.

Excellent game! Nice placing of tiles. It can be played nicely o very nasty. Of course, luck plays a part because you pick the tiles from a bag.
Therefore, for 3-5 players is only a 7 but with two players is much better.

Neat game, don't like how important farms are but the game would definitely be lacking without them.  Have played traders and builders a couple times and really like what that adds.

RATING: 5
Carcassone is really just Dominoes with pretty scenic tiles instead of numbers, but Carc deceptively has more complicated scoring.

I like Dominoes because it makes no bones about the fact that it is a math game. And I like it because the math is simpler.

I will confess that I just don't like Carc, and might just be looking for reasons to not like it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I used to enjoy this game a lot, but newer tile-placement games like Tikal and Arkadia have made me play this one a lot less often. As a standalone game, its not that impressive, but it really starts to shine once you've added a few expansions. For a standalone Carc, I prefer Hunters and Gatherers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I love Carc...its my current obsession.  The different strategies to build my things and block my opponents.  The different ways to score points and even the luck element, as frustrating as it can be, appeals to me in this.  My favorite expansions are Inns and Cathedrals and Traders and Builders.

I bought it because so many people say it should be in any board gamer collection. After a few month totally disagree, there are other gateways and fillers far better out there (splendor, star realms, welcome to the dungeon,etc).

Carcassonne is one of the first real euro-games that I got everyone else playing, and we all love it. Its a great gateway game, and with the first couple of expansions plays really well with up to 6. After that, more expansions make it more and more complicated, hence me not having any of them ;)

A fun, colorful, thought-provoking-but-not-too-daunting game. It's popular with a few of my workmates, too, which helps.

My interest in Carc has declined somewhat as other games have taken the fore, hence my initial 9 has slid to an 8. Nonetheless, Carc is among my most-played games of "all time" and retains a good deal of its appeal for me. The best way to play, I think, is with both I&C and T&B, although together they extend the game perhaps just a little, time wise, beyond its welcome.

There are 3 games I avoid like the plague - Catan, Puerto Rico and Carcassonne. The pieces are crap, the gameplay stunted and the game objective a joke. I mean, what&#039;s the significance of a place like Carcassonne in human history that they gotta make a game about it? A real waste of time, and completely pointless to boot. Even when you&#039;ve emerged victorious, you don&#039;t feel like you actually did anything to deserve victory. I know the Germans are trying hard to stay away from violent themes in boardgaming, but this is absolutely ridiculous. Watching paint dry might be more fun by comparson.

One of the three big gateway games.  We weren't enamored with it the first time we played it, but eventually realized how much fun it is.  It is easy to teach.  It is quick to play.  We got the Big Box, which was way to much box for what you get.  But having the expansions makes the game deeper and more strategic.

Update: After playing way too much of this at work, my wife is burned out on it. It will probably only come out with family when we need an easier game to play with them.

It is worth noting that whilst this account is under my name and I'll be the primary user, I'm also cataloguing the games the belong to the rest of the people in my home. They adore this game and are generally up for a game of Carcassonne, however it does nothing at all for me. I'll play if everyone else wants to, but I won't seek it out on my own. 

We do have a few expansions, but I'm unsure which ones.

Carcassonne is one of those games that I'm not quite sure why I love it so much. It's easy to teach, and almost everyone I've played it with loves it. It seems to scratch an OCD itch that I didn't think I had. I've never been into puzzles, but I love laying the tiles, lining them up, and completing features, and a lot of people seem to love that about Carcassonne, as well. I love that you're doing one thing per turn, and there is little down time - these two things are a big reason why this is such a great gaateway game. I actually play it with the most basic rules - we don't even use farmers or abbots most of the time - because I like this game as a relaxing break from more intense, strategy games.

Such a smooth and excellent gateway game it gets an 8 from me even though I generally won't want to play it. I like something with more depth and mechanisms. 

Yes, this game has expansions and with a couple I personally enjoy it more. If you are a more experienced board-gamer, expect to splash for at least 2 almost immediately after playing the base game. And I'm not referencing the river/abbot.

RATING: N/A
It's simple to learn, can be played quickly, and there's quite a bit of strategy involved.  

The downside is that there's a bit too much luck involved when playing with 5 people.  I've played the basic version and the River expansion, with I&C and T&B in the mail right now.
From what I've read, those make it more playable for larger groups.

My favorite gateway game to teach to those that are uninitiated to modern strategy games. Carcassonne is extremely easy to teach, has very intuitive rules, and can accommodate a large number of players.

It does not have the strategic depth of heavier games, and skilled players will acknowledge that there are only ever two or three "obvious" moves to make on any given turn. However, this works in favor of the game in terms of keeping play fast-paced, and prevents new players from getting overwhelmed. Often, the best of these choices is not itself obvious, anyways.

This was my second journey into Euro-gaming and I played with my two female cousins, neither of whom play any other boardgames that I'm aware of, but one of whom owned it.  It was very fun to play while on a family vacation with nothing else to do.  I'm sure it would hold up where in other circumstances, but I'm a bit biased against Euro games since I prefer games with a deeper theme.

I have a love hate relationship with this game. I first purchased it in 2004 and tried to get everyone to play. It wasn't until 5 years later did I expand my board game collection. I blame the crappy user interface of BGG and the bland themes of eurogames that confused me.

Got off to a bad start with this one, playing it with only two players, neither of us knowing how to really play.  That initial experience soured me a bit on the game.  But playing with more players has improved its standing and I can definitely appreciate its gateway status.  Downtime, and the whole farmer situation have been minor problems.

Edit: After time has passed, I now reverse my stance.  I enjoy a fast-moving game, and playing with 2 players is probably ideal for me.

[b]Simple and addictive game [/b]which focuses on fort and road stealing. Very irritating if playing with an experienced player. They know how to screw you up so bad and it feels like you can't do anything about it. It's fun if you can teach your new player the strategy because the game mechanics are simple enough to pick up fast. Hardest concept is the farmers, which makes the game very tricky.

Its a light, fun game which is very replayable. And it can be taught very quickly to new players. Players build cities by placing cleverly designed tiles and attempt to score points for them.

Actually we gave this game as a gift to my brother and after playing several games we forgot about it, because we thought that there is too much randomness involved. However, after a long brake, I played it again and saw that although there is a lot of luck, but it is possible to control it a little bit. Now I really enjoy playing this game, although there are some games which I like more

Iš tiesų, šį žaidimą kažkada seniai dovanojome Karoliui ir po kelių partijų jį numetėme, nes mums jame buvo per daug atsitiktinumo. Kaip ten bebūtų, po ilgos pertraukos sužaidžiau jį dar kartą ir pamačiau, kad sėkmės nors ir daug, bet galima ją kažkiek kontroliuoti. Dabar šis žaidimas man visai patinka, nors yra žaidimų, kuriuos mėgstu labiau.

Rating have dropped, I'm not sure why.  Perhaps because of the multiple farmer rules (never know which to teach), or the too many expansions (can't figure out which tile to take out to play the "original," or the just draw one tile (at the beginning of the turn) which make the game overly long.  Figuring out which variant to play has become a chore.

Carcassonne is one of the biggest tile laying games out there. It's very popular and not a bad game in any way. The expansions bring even more to the table (literally) and I like that game quite a lot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun, plays fast, looks good and the huge load of expansions reduces the possibility of this game getting boring. The basic game, however, lacks some options and choices are maybe a little too often quite obvious. For more substance, go for Alhambra.

Tile-laying [i]par excellence[/i]. A classic. Love it. I'm definitely in the camp that believes that it is best with two players. And with two, I'm pretty much prepared to play anytime.

There is a view that, somehow, since this is a gateway game, it doesn't deserve a high rating. Nonsense. This is far-and-away the best of the gateway games and is well-deserving of its high rating.

I've gave this a low rating after one play a while back.  I think it would go up with more plays.  I didn't like how people got stuck in fields for the whole game and constantly trying to figure out if placement of your meeple was legal or not.  I'll probably give it a shot again some day.

Carcassone is another in the category of games with simple rules and a great deal of potential for growth in skill. As far as tile-laying games go, it offers a lot to like. I have no experience with expansions other than the River, but my understanding is that they offer plenty of novelty should the main game ever grow tiresome.

Simple, pleasant, and enjoyable.

[b]Update 11.26.07 :[/b] I raised this game from an 8 to a 9. I still haven't played it with any expansions except River 1 and the Mini-Expansion from one of my gaming mags (which introduced the much needed new river start tile). I have now played it quite a few times with 2, 3 and 4 players. For me I prefer it with 2 or 3 players, although with 4 it still ranks around an 8. Normally I'm not a big fan of luck, but this game shares similar traits with [gameid=24508] which I also enjoy quite a bit too. [b]Original:[/b] I found this game to be pretty fun. You randomly draw a tile (luck) and place it to where it helps you the most (luck again). The luck in the game though is balanced by the strategic placement of your meeples which you can only place on the tile you just placed. Do you hold off or do you place a knight, thief, or bishop to help score some points so you can reuse them later, or invest a few farmers that are stuck in the fields the entire game but might bring home the bacon (and the win) at the end of the game? Easy to learn and teach, the few rules offer quite a bit of depth in terms of game play.

Great, elegant, massively replayable. Games of 150+ points are regularly decided by just a handful of points, so there is tension throughout. Works well with two players. If you end up with "one big farm" syndrome, try The River.

One of the most interesting game I have ever played. Best in a 1v1 setting. A decent amount of luck but it doesn't affect the game much if a player understand the tile compositions.

A game must be rated following the original ruling and Carcassonne is a game ruled by pure luck. If you add the unofficial rule that allow the players to keep 3 tiles and the first expansion it deserve a better rating.

Decent tile/area control game. I think "The City" is the best version. Edit: Oct 21/16 Still a 6 after a decade of playing. Mainly, I have it in the house for a more well rounded collection as a good host. It's still just decent - if someone suggested it I would play it, but it's not one i would reach for unless it was a person(s) being newly introduced to the hobby.

Great, fun game.  Light for sure, but still some decisions to be made.  Tile drawing kills those who hate luck based games, but if you take it for what its worth, its a great game.

Carcassonne hangs around even in this "cult of the new" era of games we are living in, and with good reason.

Carcasonne it a funny one. It's fun but the more the players involved, the more luck and random-related frustration. The best carcasonne games invlove fewer people. 2 player is very engrossing and tactical, but obvs not as sociable....  

Oh yeah, and there's "THE CLOISTER" problem: the thorn in the side of the developper for this game. Not the only one, either unfortunately.

2014-02-13 - Don't put too many expansions to it at one time - it's a good game but not worth 2 hour play.

2018-02-20 - 6->5 - I played a couple of times since my last rating. I'm not a fan of regular Carcassonne. I could play it if you ask me, but I prefer South Seas much more and would prefer to try other standalone games from the series.

A perpetual favorite at our house, and our game of choice when it comes to introducing non-gamers to "real games."  We tend to play in a very non-confrontational manner...some might say this becomes multi-player solitaire, and maybe that's true.  But we prefer that to getting irritated with each other over a game (which, yes, we've been known to do).

The game that my wife is most likely to agree to play. Top game design and even my daughter will play on occasion. 

Update - My wife is now my main gaming partner after the split up of my group. She plays a much much wider variety of games. This remains her favourite but she does like to chop and change between plays of many different games so this doesn't see the table quite as often.

This game is so great. This was the second modern board game I ever played and it still hasn't gotten old (mind you, I started playing them in March 2017). Tile laying games were a whole new world to me and I love that I make my own "board" essentially. After playing for a few months, I enjoy being able to maneuver a piece so it ruins my opponent's castle or road!

Carcassonne is an excellent gateway game. It's easy to learn and plays at a decent pace. Gets more strategic with just 2 players. There is a bit of waiting when it's not your turn, however, and the game isn't very deep, so serious gamers will eventually want something meatier.

Competitive and fun with the right group + expansions, but otherwise it devolves into a puzzle.

Just don't like it that much. Visuals are "okay", gameplay seems to be too slow; and even though I believe that there is tactic and logic etc., I can't be bothered to try and find it.

Fantastic game.  The rules seem quite intimidating/complicated to new users, taking a solid 5 minutes of explaining.  Once they begin to play they're happy to find that the game isn't as complicated as they thought.  Fun for light strategy and thinking.  A big hit with my family (all over 25).  Plays well with all recommended players (2-6), with different experiences for different amounts ie. more heavy thinking with 2-3, a bit more chaos with 4-6.  We're hooked.

RATING: 8
easy rules, neat extensions, fun to play with few as well as with up to 6 players. this is a great game! it is definitely more interesting with some of the expansions. having more tiles changes the dynamics a lot. that said, the basic game on its own is one of the best games that can be played with only 2 people! at least in my experience.

I bought this game because it's often recommended around every board game forum, it's a classic and it's easy enough to learn. I've now played 6 games of it with a range of 2-5 players and I find that the more of it I play the more I want to play. I'm having a blast with it. I took the advice in the rules to not play with farmers, abbott, or rivers to start and we've just introduced the farmer and I feel like this is a great way to do it because it's making the game more strategic as we play more.

I'm looking forward to playing this more and I really wish that I had someone in my house who wanted to play with me steadily instead of waiting for friends! I paid $35 at a local board game shop, but I've seen it for $25 at Target (I think it was Target). It's well worth the money though.

Edit: I am changing my score from 8 to a 9. I really really enjoy this game and the more that I play it the more I want to play it.

It's hard to rate this individually. This rating assumes a set of expansions appropriate to the group/circumstances. With too many/too few/the wrong ones it can go down by at least a point or two, possibly more in extreme cases.

At times, just the base game is the correct answer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Favorite of one of my partners, but we play without farmers because she thinks they are too complicated (it does simplify scoring at the end, but it removes the battles for control of the big farms). I really prefer the old graphics, the new ones are overflowing with little blue towers that add nothing and make reading the tiles confusing. If you're going to get lots of expansions (I would not play without at least Inns & Cathedrals) then get yourself the Broken Token organizer, it rocks.

Man I loath this game.  It is _so_ boring.  It almost seems like an afterthought.  I have seen gamers playing this and doing other stuff at the same time!  I acknowledge its ability to bring new people into the hobby but really, what is everyone raving about.  Yeah I know, I have read the posts too.  And then all the expansions.  Are we being raped by Carcassone.  Are there not better games to buy!!!!

Not sure all the fuss...pretty boring.  My mom quit halfway through her first game because she said "there's no point."  A little better with experienced players, but still not very fun.  Plays okay with two, but better with three.  Just too much luck involved in drawing.  Enjoy the variant of having a "hand" of tiles much better.

One of the grand daddy of tile laying games.
One of my earlier games that i bought to play with my gf at the time - now she is my wife, dont think because of Carcassone though, but you never know).
It filled the role perfectly. We wanted an easy game, that wasnt overly aggressive or long - Carcassone is all of these (can be longer if you play with more sets) and we both enjoyed the building aspect. Our favourite is, when we have the time, is to play with 2-3 base sets and then when all the tiles are gone, to have a look at the map that we have created. Very cool!
As for the tons of expansions, i only have one of them, and i quite enjoyed how it added a little spice to the game. Having said that, i also tried with another expansion and would consider adding maybe one more expansion to our games - however, i would not want to be playing with more than three expansion at once, as it just convolutes the game and reduces the streamlined, "easy" feeling.

This one fell flat with most of my friends and myself. While I see that there is a strategy component behind tile placement. I just don't really enjoy the limited decision making process that seems to take place in this game.

Others may disagree with me, but I feel settlers has more interesting decisions in terms of negotiation, trading, decision to purchase or wait, where to move as well as initial set up (dependent on examining where other players are)

Carcassonne just feels too simple to me. Another factor is probably that there wasn't much verbal interaction based on the game.

Már nagyon régóta vártam, hogy végre játszhassak ezzel a játékkal. Látva, hogy több, mint 10 éve töretlen a sikere, és hogy folyamatosan jelennek meg hozzá a kiegészítők, nagyok voltak az elvárásaim. Valószínűleg kicsit túl nagyok. Az alapjáték valójában nagyon könnyed, gyors játékmenetű. A szabályok pár perc alatt elsajátíthatók. Először szándékosan mindenféle kiegészítő nélkül játszottuk, és bevallom, nekem kicsit kevésnek tűnt. Hiányoltam a bonyolultabb, fejtörőbb szituációkat. Ez persze betudható annak is, hogy csak ketten játszottuk. Hátha több játékos esetén néhány kiegészítőt is használva összetettebbé válik a játék.

Frissítés: igen, fantasztikus lett a különböző kiegészítőkkel, de az alapjátékot továbbra is kevésnek érzem. Mindenesetre most már szívesen játszom vele. :)

Nice game. Tile drawing offers the thrill of discovery on every turn.  Inexpensive too, though it feels a little short by itself if your used to playing with the expansions.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.1
Original Carcassonne is easy to play, fun, and features gentle competition.  As you add expansions, the game loses this gentle charm, and players are charged with knowing more and more rules.

As you add expansions you also add time to the game.  This removes Carcassonne from the light family game that plays in 45 minutes and transforms it into a more involved game that takes longer.

I once had a bunch of expansions for this game.  I have trimmed down to the first two major expansions, and the Cathars.  I also kept the tile rack from the Tower, but ditched the rest of that expansion and all others.

Well, the other variants (Hunters & Gatherers, Ark of the Covenant, Neues Land et al) are all much, much better from a standalone game point of view than the basic game.

The blue Carcassonne starts to shine a little brighter with the first expansion, though, and with more expansions piled on it becomes even more of a decent game. Unfortunately each expansion also pushes the game length into the borderzone of tedium.

So, I prefer Hunters & Gatherers as my everyday poison, but basic Carc' is alright every once in a while.

We don't always have the time or the energy to play big box Anglo games. Also the old memory isn't as good as it used to be for remembering complex rule systems. A nice simple euro game where complexity comes from simple game mechanics can be a life saver.

And to me, this is one of the best. Even my mum will play this.

Great game, Alex loved this, we've not used Farmers yet for points but he's grasped the concept of cities, roads and monestaries for scoring and really enjoyed the design and jigsaw style component, very "Wooly Bully" in style which he liked.

Acquired around 2000 pre-River expansion. Only played 19 times in 2006 but was averaging 30-40 games per year before that. Total number of plays > 200. I will never turn down a game in the 2-4 player range. It's superb with two-players. I almost always include Inns & Cathedrals. Only small drawback is the farmer scoring confuses new players.

Pretty much the perfect game for introducing people to the hobby. It's so simple to play even my Nana can play it. My Mum's favourite game.

The game also continues to be entertaining against board game enthusiasts and gameplay takes on a whole new level. Everyone is so busy fighting over a huge field and the large cities within that the cities never finish and the farmers score very little. Haha!

I've never met anybody who doesn't enjoy Carcassonne. Not a game I want to play every gaming session, but I can't see it being a game I would ever sell.

This is a lovely game which combines simple rules, fun tile-laying mechanism and surprisingly deep strategy, especially how you can use your placement to help or hinder other players, and take long-term bets on the development of the map.

There is luck in the draw of the tiles, obviously, which can help balance the game between experts and novices. That said, it doesn't take a long time to play and victory is rarely down to a single lucky tile.

Well... what to say about this? Carcassone is a bit like Settlers from Catan: It was (and maybe still is) a bestseller in games which has more expansion than it is good for it. 
But the game is actually really good and the first two or three expansions are also fun. Didn't played any of the other expansions...

UPDATE: The game is Funnest with the three tiles variant and Builders and Traders expansion!

Three tiles variant: Always have three tiles on hand during and between turns (Gives it a more strategic feel)

Builders and Traders: BEST expansion to the game, gives incentive to finish other peoples castles!!!! 

(Original Edition) Bought the original loved it so much bought "The Big Box". I leave the original at work. Great game and quick enough to play during lunch break. My family and my wife love how simple the game is and yet very unique in its own way. Never played a game like it

(The "Big Box" Edition), Played all editions recently, really made the game very long and extremely complicated. The scoring for the end game was to tedious to even care. The game is still amazing, Just wouldn’t recommend to play Every single rule in Carcassonne. Next time I play I won’t play Barns, Wagons, Inns and Cathedrals, Simply cause of the points can be overlooked and become to tedious. I loved the entire Big Box just would not mix up all of the expansions together.

Doesn't do much for me at all.  It's nice to look at, has a cooperative element (in building the common map), and is easy to pick up (except for farmer scoring), but it's just not that much fun.  Obviously, a lot of people love it, but to me it's rather boring and repetitive.

A good gateway game, but not enough variety to hold my interest, and the expansions didn't help. It's a "one trick pony" tile-laying game, and towards the end it becomes a real bean-counter, as well. On the positive side, the game is simple enough for kids. My daughter could play it well, even at seven years old.

In my view it is an essential game, a bit of board game history. That said I had difficulty to decide whether I would rate it 7 or 8. It is a good introductory game, rules can be modified to add more strategy, good two player sabotage game, can be a heavier party game and so forth.

I guess you don't really need many expansions, but the one I believe changed the game play and strategies a lot is "Traders and Builders".

A very elegant game and easy to play, even the first time. Appears at first to be too much based on luck but at a high level of play, it's more like an investment game and luck doesn't affect the outcome much.

I would give this classic beauty a 10, however drawing a single tile a turn means some games, especially with more players, just too random.

There is a luck factor in this game with drawing tiles, but there are still strategies to be played with the tiles you draw.  Not particularly good at this game, but enjoy it when played.

RATING: 8
Was for a while my favorite game (with the expansions). I understand the criticisms, but the randomness is not an issue with me. And I know from beatings I endured on BSW that there is skill to this game, and tile draws will not mitigate against a difference in skill levels. Tis game has been a hit with every family member and friend we have taught it, and it is one my wife and I can play again and again. I prefer it for only 2-3 players. When it is just my wife and I, we play non-aggressively (limited blocking of each other in, etc.), and as a comfort game, it works just as well as when played in a more confrontational style. There are eople whose opinion I value who really, really don't like this game, but the objections they raise don't seem to bother me.

I've heard it is a good family game and an appealing game even for non-gamers if played nice but I'm not very good at that. For me this game is a tense confrontation that's all about resource management, risk management, optimization, protecting your investments, and stealing from your enemies as much as possible to maximize your score. 

With the Inns & Cathedrals expansion this game ranks among my favorites for 2 & 3 players. With more players it is still a fun game but the influence of luck and chaos upon the outcome increases with each player added.

One of the first Euro games that I played before realizing just how far the rabbit hole went. I enjoyed this one from the start of placing people and scoring points. I have never played this game in its physical form, only having enjoyed it on XBox Live Arcade when it was released years ago, and more recently on the iPad. Not sure how scoring is done in person, but that seems like it could be tedious and subtract from the overall fun. Either way a great introduction game for anyone who is looking to get into gaming.

Classic intro game that can be played with family and gamers alike. Have most expansions but don't play this as much anymore. Familiarity of tiles can be an advantage for offense and defense, overall this is a fun easy to learn (except farmer scoring) game that most will enjoy. To help minimize some of the randomness of tile selection, the hold two/play one variant seems to work well.

This was the third "true" game I played and instantly fell in love with it. More important, my wife also loves it, though hates using farmers. This is a great example of very strategic tile-laying, obviously with some luck, but not that much. It has a perfect length, a few good expansions that really add a lot to it. And it's simple, but not simplistic.

Right now it's a notch below  Race for the Galaxy, but still a strong 10.

Power to the Meeples.
This is where the Meeples come from.  The game is a great gateway game there are a lot of good strategies to it but the game just never appealed to me.  Maybe some of the expansions would entertain me more since more would be going on.

RATING: 10
Excellent cutthroat tactical game for two or three players. Doesn't work with four or more, though: the luck factor just breaks it.

Good gateway tile placement game. Best played with the variant to choose from three tiles (1 open & 2 hidden) instead of picking a tile and placing it. This allows a bit more tactical gaming. How the farmers are counted is likely to be a point of discussion as it differs in editions/translations. Settle this in advance!

Very friendly game for non-gamers. It is almost interaction free and gives the players opportunity to build own kingdom and gain VP's without any disturbance. It's nice to play with someone who you like to play with but who doesn't like games like Caylus.

Carcassonne is very good game for 2-3 people. With 5 or 6 players uptime and randomization are very high and gaming becomes pointless.

[size=12][b]Why I dislike Carcassonne:[/b][/size]
- The game lacks meaningful decisions because you are just randomly drawing and placing a tile. There are other filler games that are shorter and more enjoyable to play. 
- I am not a fan of collectible games and Carcassonne qualifies for this status with the number of expansions the game has. I consider this a sign that the game is flawed.

Those damn farmers destroy otherwise light no-brains game. Oh, it's okay as long as all people who are playing have played only with the same expansions or without any, but when there's more than one way to count points for fields, it gets my thumbs-down. I still sometimes play this (when drunk enough) and with people who like the plain-vanilla version without any expansions, or just King&Scout and River.

RATING: 9
it's great to introduce non-gamers like at christmas meetings, as anyone can jump right in and play. It is language independent, and scoring is easy to explain. I played it about 20 times and while it feels like you can plan the end score is an equal percentage. So if you play 10 times with 4 opponents you will win 2 times, and each player also wins 2 other times.
-1 because the 6 player variant with the he-men is mandatory.

Simplistic at first glance but there is so much strategy to think about in this game. I enjoy how you can play this game as a peaceful game, but can also be played to be very aggressive. Also scales very well as a two player game. Update: I am not getting tired of this game and I really cant see that ever changing. I think everyone should have this in their collection.

A game I am not 100% sure about but I think it is very good. The expansions change things a lot and seem to add a fair amount of 'depth' to this fun little package...

It still seems very random though and at time I do wonder how mjuch influence I am actually having over the result.

RATING: 6
Simple and elegant. Easy and appropriate for many age groups. My prime complaint with the mechanics is that many players seem to find the farm rules somewhat difficult - solved by the publisher's fix on their website. I've found it less interesting with subsequent plays, due mostly to the rather dull theme.

Light game to wrap up an evening after a long day. No brain-busting decisions, just a pleasant time.

UPDATE JULY 2015: The more games I get, the more rulebooks I read, the more I crave the simplicity of Carcassonne. I have dubbed it my "Beer with Buddies" game, meaning you can sit down at a table with your friends, have a beer and chat about things while also laying down a tile here, a meeple there. I'm bumping it up from a 7 to an 8 because of that.

Played obsessively on xbox-live.
Still love it now that I usually play face-to-face.
I'm a cutthroat mofo at this game.
2-player is best, but any game i'm involved in is guaranteed to devolve into a castle and field stealin' battle to the death.
Now that my g/f has discovered xbox-live, all she ever wants to do is play Carc on there together, even though we're sat side by side. She says the scoring is so much easier (must agree). Anyway, I expect my play count will shoot up tremendously as a result.

Still highly recommended but I would choose a lot of other games before proposing this.

Fast ,funny tile placement game it's more an eye-brain game,you have to see the best place where to put your tile and your worker on it.It's not so simple and some players have far bettere "wideyes" than others...So strategies are possible in the basic game to stop or to rovine plans to other players but the best way to play this game is with it's expansion the Tower which allow some direct and brutal interaction between players...

Good for introducing non-gamers to European board games. The point system is what gives it purpose but the point system is also what doesn't really appeal to me. This Catch22 in my psyche is why I don't play it more. The expansions help brighten it up but also muddle up the purpose. So far all the expansions have proven a hit in our family except for the tower which was promptly ignored from day one.

Extremely easy to learn, and relatively short to play. However, any good-laid strategy can easily be disrupted by a series of bad draws. While strategy is important, the luck factor is a bit too big to ignore. And two-player games just feel like a tug of war.

It's light and easy to teach. It can be played in relaxing way (try it with some Renn Fair music). But it can also be played in a cut throat style - vying for farm land. Plays well as a 2-4 player game very well. It plays well as a 5 player game too, though the down time can get high.

RATING: 7
played several times, and actually the first 'boardgame' I extensively played together with star realms. I'm liking the game, but it kinda depends who I'm playing it with (competitive or not, or wether it takes other people too long to decide). And I would have liked it if the tiles were a bit more alive. *Recently discovered there are stickers you can add to your tiles ^^ 
Also, I need to try out the houserule that says you can take a tile in advance and play that one on your turn to save downtime. It's mainly the downtime that's bothering me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
One of my favorite games. It's like a competitive tile matching puzzle game. It has very pleasant to look at art, and the tiles are nice and thick. The building a landscape theme makes this a nice pick for younger crowds since it's nonviolent. There are many expansions of various sizes for Carcassonne, so there's tons of customization. My recommendation is to not use TOO many expansions at once or else you'll get a long and confusing game.

I've been playing this for over a year now and it hasn't lost its shine. It continues to hook my friends with its unmistakeable charm. Plus, it gains a few pounds (bad weight joke) when playing with more experienced Carcers. My appreciation of the design has certainly grown over time. [b]8->9[/b]

RATING: 4
This is a pretty easy game to explain to prospective players, though the importance of farmers is often underestimated at first.  We prefer to play with a small hand of tiles to increase strategic planning.  Occasionally, the game can get pretty intense with meeples getting trapped in escalating farm wars.

With a small hand and exactly two players, I might give the game another point or two.

Well-known tile-laying game which is still good, even I have (finally) growth out of it - just played it too much (~50). If you haven't ever played Carcassonne then you should, because it's definitely one of the most played boardgame ever. However, the basic set of Carcassonne needs the first expansion set, otherwise game is imbalanced: you get too much points of cities compared to roads.

RATING: 8
In this fairly light tile-laying offering, players pull a tile from the pool and then place it against one of the previously played tiles. If you create a new object (like a city, road or a monastery), then you can place one of your control markers on the tile to denote your control. Alternately, you can place your marker in the pasture on the tile as a farmer. Markers (called Followers by the publisher and called Meeples by us) cannot directly compete when placed, so to achieve some gains you must place your marker, then use later tiles to connect up to it.

The original, the almost-perfect, the simple-but-great gateway game. It's just amazingly capable of converting non-gamers to gamers and I rate its capacity a 9. 

Update (2009) : Unfortunately after I became converted a gamer and learned hundreds of games it's just not so fun anymore (well, not without some expansions).

Update (2013) : I don't know why, but it's starting to grow on me again. Especially with the many expansion modules wisely used (never all of them, and always only the tiles belonging to given expansions) it provides a Kindom Builder-like experience.

[2007.Apr.12] The tile laying mechanic is simplicity in itself. The additional expansions add all manner of fun new tiles, as well as new scoring methodologies. As you add more tiles however, the time required to play the game (naturally) increases. This is an easy game to play with spouses, significant others, or other games who aren't into "heavy" games. Carcassonne is must have in any gamer's collection.

This was one of my first games, and it's probably a relatively good gateway game. But the fun lasted just for two or three games and after that it became a bit boring.

Carcassonne is a tile-placement game in which the players draw and place a tile with a piece of southern French landscape on it. The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of his meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.

This is so very simple and the player has very limited actual control over how it's going to end.  This control seem to diminish as the # of player goes up.  Plus, even tho the mechanics are simple, the scoring can be a real hassle.  The best version I've seen of this is on XBox Live Arcade (a video game adaptation) where everything is automated and the only part left is the actual fun to be had (tile placement).  It's not a bad game, I just don't like it.

Sweet game. Extremely easy to play, but deep enough for the time it takes. It is very strange to find a game that can be played for both hardcore gamers and no gamers at all, and Carcassonne brilliantly hits this spot.

Carcassonne is a fun light game, that looks great!  My first Euro game! It has some annoying luck in the tiles, but it's not supposed to be a strategic brain burner. The expansions help to keep it different and interesting and give it a little more strategy.

RATING: 7.5
Base (vanilla) rating is probably a 7.  An excellent game to introduce non-gamers, newbies or casual gamers but I prefer Carcassonne Hunters & Gatherers best.  For a Carc-on-training-wheels version, just skip or eliminate the farming rules if you think that the inexperienced players/kids could not handle it yet.  With the plethora of expansions, you should a la carte which ones to add.  Four or less should keep the game from being excessively long.  It's pretty cool-looking to watch the whole landscape of Carcassonne build out.  I always think of this when Le Tour de France stage hits this town in France.  [The extra half-point to 7.5 is b/c I never play just the base game so I added it for when expansions are thrown in.]

Solid tile laying, family friendly game that should be played aggressively and thus may not be all that family friendly after all...;-)  Field scoring is fairly straight forward but can be difficult to see where fields extend.

RATING: 7
Egy játék alapján (amiben az alapjátékot és a kereskedő kiegészítőt használtuk (az építész és a disznók nélkül)) alapvetően tetszett. Szerettem azon gondolkozni, hogy hova is lenne a legjobb letenni az adott lapot, ugyanakkor kicsit olyan érzésem támadt, hogy nincs igazi választási lehetőségem: ha odaillik valahova, ahova nekem jó, akkor oda kell letenni, ha meg nem, akkor pedig nagyjából mindegy. Szóval nem éreztem eléggé, hogy a saját döntéseim alakítanák a játékot, túl nagy volt annak az aránya, hogy a játék önmagát játszotta a két játékost bábként felhasználva.
Kevésnek éreztem a játékosok közti interakciót. Nehéz elérni, és nem is igazán törekszik rá az ember, hogy az adott mezőn/várban/úton többségbe kerüljön, ha más is odavetődik; mi inkább csak magunknak játszottunk, szinte passziánszoztunk. Ezen lehet majd javítani a gróf és a sárkány kiegészítőkkel, kíváncsi vagyok mennyit javul velük a véleményem.
Szóval így elsőre nekem túl egyszerű ez a játék, amiben lehetne ugyan sokat gondolkozni minden egyes lépésen, de ez valószínűleg nem sokkal növelné a játékélményt. Nem igazán lehet a másik játékára hatni, csak nagyon közvetett módon, ami vagy összejön, vagy nem. Direkt kölcsönhatás a játékosok között gyakorlatilag nincs, ennek a hiányát erősen éreztem.

A társasjátékokkal többször játszva mindig javulni szokott róluk a véleményem, hisz jobban megismerve őket jobban meglátom az értékeiket, a szépségüket, és valószínűleg ennél is ez fog történni. Első játék után kb. 7 pont, aztán majd meglátjuk!

Update: Játszottam 3 személlyel is, teljesen jól működik így a játék. Játszottam a netes verzióban egy rakás kiegészítővel (sárkányos, építész és kereskedő, kocsmás, király és vándor), azok is teljesen jól működnek, pluszt adnak a játékhoz. 7 -> 7.5 pont.

Update2: Rá kellett jönnöm, hogy ez egy férfiaknak való játék. A barátnőmmel játszottunk, és az volt a gond, hogy míg ő békésen építkezve játszott volna, addig én agresszív voltam: több félkész városát is elfoglaltam, majd végül a nagy mezőjét is. Rosszul esett neki, úgy érezte, én nem építek, hanem csak rombolok. Én viszont nem vagyok képes másképp játszani, mint győzelemre törekedve a játékszabályok maradéktalan betartásával és kihasználásával, ráadásul szerintem épp a városokért/utakért/mezőkért folyó kis csatározások adják meg a játék ízét, nélkülük ez a játék unalmas és interakció nélküli. Számomra csodás érzés küzdeni a többség kialakításáért vagy megtartásáért egy-egy nagyobb városban vagy mezőn. Az egyszerűsége mellett pont ez az, amivel együtt szerintem megérdemli az év játéka díjat, és amitől annyi rajongója van.
Női aggyal játszva (konfrontációt kerülve simán csak építkezve) semmilyen potenciált nem látok a játékban, nem érzem, mi lehet benne úgy a jó. Így aztán vegyes nemű társaságnak vagy nőknek nem javaslom, fiútestvéreknek vagy férfi baráti társaságnak viszont annál inkább, lehetőleg kiegészítőkkel együtt.

Update3: Jó játék ez: 7.5 -> 7.7 pont.

Update4: Újrapontozom a játékokat aszerint, hogy melyikkel mennyire szívesen játszanék mondjuk ma este. Ez alapján: 7

Impressive on the first play.  This was my introduction to EuroGames.  My main beef is that subsequent games seemed like reruns of the first, and that the luck of the draw and limited tile placement inhibits strategic play.

It's very easy to teach people, and because it's tricky to estimate exactly how well you're doing, I find the "sore losers" in my game group tend not to get too grumpy playing it.

I like to play the version, where all players receive 3 tiles instead of one. Give more possibilities and reduces the chance of "All-I-have-is-a-straight-road" situations. 

My brothers comment when he opened the box the very first time:
"hey this suxxx, there is not even dice in here"

Then he changed his mind.

A fun euro-ish game to play when you feel too tired for a heavier euro. I feel like an outcome strongly depends on the tile draw, but that's not really a problem for the game.

Ein Klassiker!
Wer an der Reihe ist nimmt ein Plättchen, legt es passend an und darf dann einen Meeple draufstellen. Wenn eine Burg, eine Strasse oder ein Kloster fertig wird erhält der Spieler seinen Meeple zurück und Punkte auf der Leiste.
Am Spielende erhält man noch ein paar Trostpunkte für Unfertiges und für die Wiese.
Mir macht Carcassonne wirklich viel Spaß. Am Besten gefällt es mir mit der ersten und zweiten Erweiterung. Mehr braucht man da tatsächlich nicht.

I'd love to say it's a good "gateway" game, but I know experienced gamers who can't "farm" for the life of them!  As my husband would say, though, farming makes this an actual game.  I hold a special place in my heart for Carcassonne, but as I move on to many other games I am further an further away from ever playing it again.

This is a nice chill game. There's strategy in it but I almost never want to play it seriously because it will ruin the game for me. The appeal in it for me is the ability to do something for 20-30 minutes when there's nothing else that is suggested to be played, and it does its job with that. There are definitely better games than this, and there are most certainly worse. But very few can do what this game does better.

A board game without dice!! Yes I now know this is not a novel concept, but this was the first game I played of this type.

Pretty simple game to introduce to people except for the farm mechanic. I love this game. It's very straightforward and it's neat to see the maps unfold as they are built. I have yet to play this with more than 2 people (3-14-2017), but I love the non-agressive back-and-forth and surprisingly hard decisions of where to put your meeple.

RATING: 9.5
Actually the 10-yr edition is what I have (gameplay wise, this just adds a few additional special tiles).  Easy to learn puzzle/strategy game that works with 2 people or more.  Lots of variation is possible in how the game plays out.  Approachable for non-gamers but allows gamers to partake in more in-depth strategy (especially with expansions) if they like.

I actually didn't like vanilla Carc as much as I've liked The Castle and the City. I need to try Hunters and Gatherers or Ark of the Covenant, as I wouldn't mind having a multiplayer version. UPDATE: I've played a lot of this on the iPad and am kind of burned out on it.

This game is easy to learn for a beginner, but in the terms of tactics it can offer so much more than the basics. It takes some experience to see all the "perfect spots" for placing the tiles, but that doesn't prevent the fun for a beginner, nor does it destroy the game even if you've played it a lot.

This is a great family game. Younger players can play without really knowing what they're doing without messing up the game for anyone. Some strategy, good deal of luck but most important: high fun factor. Farmers should be scored with 3 points/city.

A total classic. A fun game that anyone can play. You can make it as complicated as you want, basically, with all the various expansions. My first 'grownup' game. :-) I have strong feelings for this game, but I have to say that it shouldn't be played too often, because you can get a little tired of it. But it's a masterpiece, it really is.

A little too light for my taste, and therefore I have hard time making other players want to play it.

It can be fun, but i'm not too keen on getting out.

RATING: 8.1
One of the first wave of great Euro-strategy games, this is a game that has a very simple gameplay and easy setup and execution, but which also has endless replay value.  There's a huge number of expansions and versions available, but the original set alone is enough to keep you occupied forever.  It can be taught in just a few minutes, but with the degree of variation, it never gets stale.  You can play offensively or defensively, the strategy can get quite deep, and it's not too random.

As perhaps the very definition of a tile-laying game, it works great -- the pieces are solid with attractive artwork, and the theme is simple enough to lend itself to a lot of variations.  It takes up a decent amount of space, but there's not too many pieces or too much complexity.  This game is a classic for a reason, combining simplicity and elegance for tons of play value.

I love Carcassonne. I purchased the big box 2010 edition and it was the best $75 I had ever used to purchase a game. Carcassonne is so simple, and yet the strategy is amazingly complex with just the right amount of complexity to make it a hit. The reason it got a 9 was because my very first play I just wanted more out of it, more tiles, different tiles, more ways to score, more ways to screw someone. BAM! expansions. This game is perfect with two players, tried it with three and it went well, but it's hard to explain with more people but it's easy to pick up and play. Grade: A+

Awesome! One of my cousins, my brother and I were planning on playing something for the Friday night, I suggested "that new game that just arrived". We played one time normally and two with the River expansion (included). After that, they trusted my judgment on "wierd games" and we played Settlers once. This week I'm gonna introduce them into C&K!

Edit: I've played it with more people, not gamer people, they've enjoyed the puzzle feeling, it became aggresive, all trying to make a big city (none of them ever completed it) but it was great...

Edit: The enjoyment is almost gone. Everytime people requests to play this game I quickly try to change to another one. It just doesn't make it anymore for me. I'm thinking of adding expansions, but that might make it even more long and painful...

This was our gateway game.  The tile placement mechanism is very conceptual and understandable---you just have to match up the edges.  Using meeples for controlling different areas elevates the strategy above simple tile matching.  

We were also able to still have fun playing with only two players.  For the first couple of months, we would play several times each night.  We would play over and over again.  The best part of the game, and something that I think is underrated, is that the gameplay scales very well with your experience level.  In the beginning, we would play nicely and it became more of a "race" game to finish features.  But as we played it more, we began to get a lot more aggressive and cut-throat as we'd hone in and try to steal each other's cities, roads, and farms.  You can fine tune the amount of interactivity in the game to the comfort of each player.  

Even after several years, we still have [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/39484/item/862918#item862918]tense, nerve-wracking games[/url].  I have to give it a well-deserved  10 rating.

Just recently got a copy of this after playing our friend's (who has all the expansions) many times, was surprised at how quick and low-scoring the game is when you don't have all those extra goodies. Regarding gameplay - since you aren't allowed to directly move in on someone's claimed feature it may seem very good-natured and less competitive... but just give it a few games and the cuttthroat maneuvers develop.

The base game of Carcassone. Easy and fun to play. This is a must have for every boardgame lover and perfect as a family game ... especially when there are grown children that join in.

There is little anyone can add to the hundreds of positive comments made already.  Yes it is lite but you can still go to bed thinking of what you did wrong and what you would do differently next time.  However, in my experience it is mostly thinking what i did wrong.  The best recommendation I can give the game is that it was brought for a family get-together (a boardgame to them is trivial pursuit/monopoly etc) to encourage everyone to have fun and spend some quality time together and in this it succeeded entirely.  I should give it a 9 but as I am still yet to win there must be something wrong with the game ... it can&#039;t be me can it?

Excellent tile-layer. Quite a few rules, but the basic gist of the game can be explained in a few minutes (leave the scoring in the hands of a pro for the first few plays). A must for any serious eurogamer, and a toehold into the genre for newbies. Not beer-proof. Of the two "entry-level" eurogames, my gaming group generally prefers Catan, but Carcassonne hits the table often enough.

This is definitely game that I'm always willing to play - it's a game you can have over a glass of red wine with the fire going in the background.

RATING: 6
Yes, I know that there is skill involved in this game (I happen to suck at it enough to see it quite clearly), but it's the randomness combined with the need to know the tile distribution that bugs me.  Just not my kind of game.

UPDATE: Bumped my rating to a 5, simply because it didn't seem right to rate this lower than Settlers and equal to Monopoly.  A casual gamer friend of mine bought a copy recently (without any prompting from me), so I will actually be playing this quite happily for the next while to encourage her gaming tendencies.

UPDATE: playing this face-to-face has increased my appreciation for the game significantly.  For some reason, while I still play to win, Carc dampens my usual competitive drive to the point where i can just sit back, relax, and enjoy being with friends.  That said, I suspect I really do need to play it with friends.  Note, this rating is for the base game with the standard start tile and no expansions.  I rate the River a 7.

This game is so simple, but can be so tense at the same time. You only ever place one tile at a time, making teaching it a breeze. The risk-reward of finishing vs. not-finishing things seems about right, though I tend to prefer a more cut-throat version like The Castle. I pretty much only play this game 2 player, though I'd play 3 if required, 4+ is rubbish (too much downtime, though the fact the board gets more clogged up with other people's stuff is interesting).

Specifically, the Carcassonne Big Box - but that isn't an option in the list.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Works well as a gateway game and definitely requires quite a bit of spatial analysis, but it's just so bland, regardless if you're playing draw 1 tile or hand of 3. It's just different ways to score points and is really abstract. Now I like Patchwork which is also a very Euro-ey, spatial aspect required, abstract game, but I like the economic button aspect of Patchwork too, along with the theme, the artwork, and that it doesn't feel as point-salady, whereas Carcassonne's multiple, somewhat arbitrary scoring methods doesn't integrate well thematically to me.

Lite and airy, fast and fun. Very, very easy and simple game. Unless you have an issue with situational positional spacial awareness, in which case you're screwed out of the gate.

Quick and fun decisions need to be made each turn, with occasional agonizing guesses and tradeoffs.

RATING: 7
A light game that was my introduction to tile laying.  I have not played the expansions outside of the River expansion and they may improve it.  Most of my deduction is given to the fact that most games I have played have come down to farm wars.  Also the rules on how farmers worked were comfusing for our group and I believe only recently have we gotten them right.  My only other complaint is that the scoring track is much shorter than it should be, really a score track that ran to ~200 would have been much more usefull if a bit bigger perhaps.

Carcassonne is one of the few serious games that I played and enjoyed as a kid. Amongst the many Monopoly variants and Cranium games, Carcassonne was a game that my parents picked up for me and my sister somewhere that I loved playing. And while it rarely hits the table anymore, it's one of my favorite games to play on my iPad. I know that there are complaints about this game, but I still think it's solid.

Took this to the neighbor's house last night.  It was a hit!  It was the first time playing for three of us, and our son had played on Xbox Live so had some experience.  Fast game, lots of fun had by all.  Played three games back to back and would have played another but the boy exceeded his waking hour limit for the day.

Players seemed to enjoy ease of rule explanation and the tactile nature of tile laying.  Some played nice (my wife and son) and some played mean (neighbor and myself).  Truly a game that can support both styles of play - not to say that the nice players appreciate the actions of the cutthroat players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Carcassonne is what personally pulled me into board games as a whole. This game has an excellent random factor of pulling tiles. This makes the game map new every time and makes it exciting every time. The random element is great because, no matter what tile you pull, you can always score some points off of it. 

Repeat plays lead to more experience as you learn the game tiles and tricks and tips of how to play certain tiles but all of this experience can be gained very quickly (1 or 2 games).

I both love and hate this game. I love it because its fun, easy, and full of strategy even though pretty much all you do is lay down tiles.

I think that is why I still like it.

One of my absolute favorite games. More depth than there appears the first ten times you play it, the player interaction is flirtatious and hilariously passive aggressive ("oh don't mind me, if you just happened to complete my road while working on your abbey, that would be fine", or "pay no attention to my dude in your castle!"). It is the perfect game that gives generously of fun for both gamers and non-gamers, that you can play as cooperatively or as aggressively as you want.

I don't know what you call this, but Carcassonne also has the highest "possible outcome" to "ease of decision making" of any game out there.

RATING: 7.5
Great game.  A lot of fun for two players - then you are playing not only to better your position but to block your opponents position.  Even better with the expansions (rating of 7 or 8 without).  I think the better expansion is the inns and cathedrals.

Much like Settlers, this one is a great friendly, non-aggressive game that's easy to learn and fun to play.  Mediated by luck (tile draws), but has enough strategic depth to keep my interest.  'Inns' & 'Builders' are great additions (esp. for the extra players and tile bag), but I think the 'Count' and 'Dragon' add too much complexity and not enough fun.

Carcassonne is a great tile laying game where you select a tile and place it on the board and may place one of you meeples in a city, road, field or cloister.  You are trying to complete these and score points.

NO game beats the simplicity and fun of this game. With added tactical approaches from (not all) expansions, you can just keep playing and playing and playing. This game got me back into board games as an adult and I play it pretty much all year round. It's an easy game to introduce to wary friends who are pretty much won over immediately, even if 'fields' still confuse them.

an ingenious game and brilliant mechanic in itself, but really needs at least 1 expansion to make it feel like a fully fleshed out game. of course by now, it has TOO MANY expansions to choose from, not all equal. but the base game is a good starting place.

A great party game. Girls always want to play this out!! If you want more strategical games, try to keep three tiles as a &quot;hand&quot;: it also reduced downtime as you think about your move while others play theirs.

Carcassonne is of course a classic and visually arresting game to play, but doesn't really get my blood pumping. It's not short enough to use as filler, not heavy enough to really engross me, and tile placement just doesn't get me where I live. I respect the game as at least being a good gateway game and having a fair amount of tension in the farmer aspect, but it doesn't stand out personally.

This game was my introduction to "serious" board gaming. I bought the copy years ago, and I required the game both "newb-friendly", nicely designed and well-worth the money invested (since at the time I wasn't able to afford buying board games).

Since then, I play(ed) it mostly with my gf. We probably finished between 60-70 matches of it, counting in the first two expansions. 

I do cherish Carc as my gateway game, but rarely do feel in mood to play it nowadays. I think it's time I introduce it to my 6-year old nephew... :)

RATING: 4
I don't know what it is exactly, but I just do not enjoy playing this game. It seems that the times I have played have been very tile dependent. I could be completely screwed if I try to build a city and don't get the tiles I need to complete it. Not a fan of this game... but I like other games that are draw a card/tile and make something happen (i.e. Kingdom Builder). So not sure what it is... maybe I just feel helpless when I draw the tile that doesn't help me at all when in Kingdom Builder there are some special action tokens I can get that will help mitigate a bad card draw or if I place my settlements better then I don't have to worry about a bad card draw. Any who... I am not a Carcassonne fan.

Easy enough to learn quickly and play with anyone.  A little more depth than you'd think after playing your first game. Opportunity to play at a higher level of strategy, especially if you play aggressively against your opponent.  

Only downside is the luck of the draw for the tiles, but for this medium-light game I think it works OK.  I think the more skilled player will win most of the time.  

Very easy to transport; if you want the tiles and followers could be in a ziplock bag for a trip.

Very good gateway game, easy to learn, appealing to non-gamers, and very different from anything the average person has ever played before. I like it but prefer more strategic games.

RATING: 6.5
Nice and fast, but the "you're screwed if you don't draw the right tile" factor is just *too* high for my tastes. Sometimes you simply do not get what you need, while your opponent draws the exact right tile he needed to complete his town or to screw your meeple, and there's a big fat pile of nothing you can do about it. And the more the players, the worse it gets. Too random.

This is a great game, that doesn't deserve criticisms for its randomness. The choices in this game are largely tactical, and the random tile draw forces you to choose between committing a meeple now, or pushing your luck and waiting for a different tile. The fact that you develop a map as the game progresses is enticing.

[2-5] The best tile placement game. I like it without the expansions most, but if I have to chose one of them, it's definetly 'Traders & Builders'. The expansions bring a nice change to an already excellent game if you use just one or two at a time. With too many of them the game lasts too long and is too confusing. So what if luck has some role here, it only matters when players are equally skilled and that makes it even more fun. [ex-online carcassonne addict]

Many plays behind us, and we continue to enjoy this game. It's great how the "board" develops as the game proceeds.

I like it well enough but the scoring system is a bit odd. And there should be some completely blank (grassy) tiles with the set.

I recently bought this game, and after several games, I am very happy with my purchase. I rank this right alongside The Settlers of Catan, however I often choose this for new players now. It is a little easier to understand and enjoy the first game. 

I find the farm scoring difficult for new players to understand, and often they will lose because of this. So beginners may want to enjoy their first game or two without this aspect of the game. 

Excellent gateway game.

This is one of my favorite games of all time.  I love the back and forth between all players.  The only house rule that we believe should be an official rule is to select a tile after you've placed on so you have time to think about where you can put it during other player's turns.

One of my entry games into the hobby/habbit/addiction.  A great example of some of the different game designs available in games now.  Still love playing but often get dizzied by the multiple expansion options.  Would love to try more expansions but don't know if anything justify how often it hits the table now.  Great game for a gateway to non-gamers though.

great fun for family gaming, and also great for heavy tactical duels
flexible rules, decreasing the luck factor is possible

its only flaw that with 4+  players there is not much control in the players hand, it gets rather haphazard

it's a 6 with the original card drawing rules but 8 without hidden card draw (see my variant in the appropriate section)

This game opened my eyes to how clever games can be. I also proposed by hiding the ring in the stack of tiles. Great memories.

Nice tile placement game.  Great for playing with none gaming friends over a few drinks, although, with all of the expansions (well, most anyway) it's quite a time investment.  I also have the travel edition, mainly so that I've got an unexpanded copy for when we want a quick game.

No Zombies.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.7
I think this game is BEST played at 2 players.  At that number, it is chess-like and challenging.  With more, it becomes more about king-making (your score being dependent on another, often disinterested or only focusing on themselves, player).  

I think the standard expansions that must be used is Traders and Builders and Inns and Cathedrals.  Beyond that I have enjoyed the worker removal factor of the Princess and the Dragon as well as the random element that Wheel of Fortune adds.  

Stay away from the Catapult as well as the Bridges.

FOR THE KIDS: Not a bad game at all, but a simplistic for all but young children. It becomes entertaining enough for adults with the addition of a few expansions, namely: Inns & Cathedrals, Traders & Builders, Mini, and Siege. That's it. Don't waste your money on anything else. Seriously. Just leave them alone. You'll regret it if you don't. We still have a few of the other expansions laying around, but we rarely use them. This game is still an excellent and light gateway game and even though we've had it forever, it's still charming.

RATING: 8
Fun game, doesn't require too much thinking/strategy but I like it. Depends on the company you may just be gathering points, or you may be stealing them. After a while it is refreshing to have an extension or two, so that it doesn't get boring. Ours came with the bishops (?) and the river, and later we bought some more.

Very fun, I play it a lot on my phone these days, and simple enough that it is one of those gateway games that can be used to try to get non-gamers to the point of being willing to try more complicated ones. Somehow I lost all my meeple in a move, which bewilders me.

Been playing it for years.  This was the game I used to prove to my friends that they were wrong all their life thinking they wouldn't like board games.  After a year of playing it fairly constantly with just me and my wife it started getting boring, was easily solved with expansions.  Price tag is lower than other games I'd judge at the same level like dominion.

One of my favorite games. Played well by most teens. Expansions are plentiful and inexpensive. Most expansions provide variability in the game, but some are a mere distraction (last five years of expansions) and some simply take the strategy out of the game (river). The original series of expansions are by far the best and allow for meaningful diversity and number of tiles. Too many expansions should be avoided as it takes far too long to explain the game to newcomers and players tire quickly from this game.

I really enjoy this one.  If you're wanting to have a decent collection of gateway games, this should be in there.  The expansions are pretty fun, and I like the fact that you can simply leave the expansion tiles in the mix for a longer game but not necessarily play by the expansion rules. (does not apply to all expansions.)

If it's a bit too light for you, just add an expansion or two.  Also lots of non-official variants can make it interesting as well (like having a hand of tiles to choose from.)

2.0 £7.99 iOS only. I bought this game because the reviews looked good, but it sat in its box for ages as it doesnt look that exciting from the outside. I do have the app on my iphone, but I didn't like the iphone instructions, didnt get how to play, so it got left.

However, when I finally got it out and played it with people, its a really nice little game. After a few games, it started to become clearer the different tactics that emerged, particularly in 2 player games where two people can build themselves into a city and both score points. The more I play, the more vicious it gets!

From a slow start this is probably one of my favourite board games ever.

Area control/Area influence, Tile Placement

Deceptively deep strategy, yet plainly simple tile laying game. This game is a favorite with the kids (aged 5 and 9) and adapts well to varying group sizes, though 2 player contests is not where this game shines.

This is a good, light game for gamers and non-gamers alike. I can almost always get my wife to play this and my mother-in-law loves ths game. 

If does have some luck elements in it but I fell a good player can adapt to a bad tile draw. I think 2 or 3 players is best and am looking forward to adding in some of the additions. 

the more i play it the more it sits on the shelf.... never again with more than 3 and 2 i think is the best for this one.  

I understand that this game is cute and non-gamers love it but it really has issues with a lot of players. There is no control in the game and it can drag on if you add in too many expansions. Its now a 4 for me and I avoid it more often than not.

When I was first introduced to this game a year or two back, I put the following brief review on my website:

"If you%u2019re into tabletop games, you could do far worse than give Carcassonne a look. Having played it (till my head hurt) quite a bit over recent weeks, I%u2019m blown away by how perfect a game it is. The rules are staggeringly simple, the strategy simple enough for a beginner to pick up (yet subtle enough to reward experience), and the games themselves last less than an hour. In my book, that ticks all of the boxes perfectly. Highly recommended."

I still stand by it. Carcassonne is, in my eyes, the perfect board game and ideal for opening your friends' eyes to the joys of gaming. Granted, many of the expansion packs can detract from the game, but the plain vanilla original is bang on the money.

I have just started playing this with my 7-year old daughter this week, and we are now playing 2-3 games a day.  She loves it.  My 5-year old daughter is also playing it, although she does not completely grasp the rules or strategy.  My wife has started playing with us too, so that is a very good sign as she is not much of a game lover.  After 4 days of playing, we just went out to purchase three of the smaller expansions.  I think that this is a great entry level family game that is complex enough to be challenging and to encourage replaying.  I recommend this one highly!!

I loved this when I was first introduced to it, but after several plays it got irritating--it's hard to plan ahead, the board changes too radically too often (one tile can suddenly put several other players' meeples in your field). And it's very hard to estimate your score, as fields are only scored at the end, by which point they'll be totally different. Scoring that happens as you play is also difficult, because the board gets so cluttered and confused. The expansions only add more clutter and chaos, nothing of value.  I can play a game of vanilla Carc and still pretty much enjoy it, but I'd rather play something else.

I cannot fault a game that acted as my gateway to more complex boardgames. It was fun and gameplay goes quickly.. if not at times annoying due to the territory wars with farmer placement.

Flip a tile, place it, move on. Simple.

Very playable with my fiance's family.

RATING: 4
This was one of the first euros I got and played tons of it initially. I liked placing the tiles and getting a cool looking map at the end. It is very strategic, but no matter how hard you play you can have all your work undone by farmer scoring at the end. Eventually gave it up because explaining the scoring mechanic to the other players (even veteran gamers) became tedious.

7.0 - Jun 2014 - 5 Plays:  A good game system, although the base game does leave a little bit to be desired.  The many expansions do help make the game a bit better.  The iOS app that I have used does a good job of distilling the most fun out of the game.

6.0 - Aug 2015 - 7 Plays:  A fine game, just one that I don't really see myself suggesting.  I prefer to play it with 2 players and play it aggressively.  I'd rarely say no to a game, but I might say yes to something else first.

RATING: 7
Is it the deepest game you will ever play? No.
Is it best game you will ever play? No.

But for what the game brings to the table, you will be very happy with your play time. Light strategy & planning, some luck with the tile draws, and plenty of fun. The best part is it is the ideal gateway game. You can teach it to non-gamers in about 5 minutes, and there is no set up. Plus there is just something fun about making a puzzle together and the meeples are cute.

A perfect way to spend 30-45 minutes with friends.

Components are of high quality.

I've played this game by far the most, mostly 2 player. It is easy to learn, even for my kids (6 and 5). I like the diffuse nature of play, that a winning strategy is built up gradually from lots of seemingly weak tiles. You don't have to concentrate or remember anything (unless you want to memorise the tile mix!). I like that opening/mid game/end game tactical changes are required too. I use a custom tile set made up of 72 tiles from the base game and I&C plus 15 trade tiles from T&B, to keep it short and snappy.

In my opinion, the only drawback of Carcassonne is that the game relentlessly encourages experienced players to be really nasty to each other during the whole course of a game (as stated in my comment of Ticket to Ride). There's no mechanism to counter it.
That said, it's one of the greatest game I know, with a replayability that earns it one of my highest scores. It was the growing hit that converted some of my closest friends to be as open to boardgaming as I am, so I can only praise it.

[b]A classic. I like tile-laying, and this one is easily explained to non-gamers (at least if you leave out farmers) while it can also be quite cut-throat if played with gamers that use every possible trick to build themselves into others' cities or to gain a majority on a meadow. I'm a bit burnt out on playing it, but don't think it's permanent.[/b]

My first "serious" game. It´s a very solid design and I really like this game. The fact that my wife never turns down a game of Carcassonne makes me like it even more. 

I like the multiple paths to points, the puzzle aspect, the simple rules, the short-medium time to play, the high replayability and the meaningful decisions. 

One thing that I specially like is the end scoring. Even if you score a lot of points during the game, you have to wait until the end scoring to confirm the victory. This keeps the tension until the very end.

I think it´s an excellent game for 2 players and a very good game for 3 players. With 4, 5 and 6 players, each player looses control and the game is just OK.

Despite being my first modern game, Carcassonne still reaches the table when we are in the right mood.

Unfortunetly, I had no success introducing this game to my non-gamer friends, I don´t know why!

Bastante simple...cada jugador pone una plaquita en la mesa para ir formando castillos, caminos, campos y poner una ficha propia sobre alguno de esos lugares, para ganar puntos teniendo castillos más grandes, caminos más largos y campos que abastezcan más castillos.
Tiene algo de rompecabezas o puzzle; algo de planificaciòn anticipada.
Tal vez jugando entre dos personas es cuando más estratégico se vuelve, porque con muchas personas se torna difícil  controlar el desarrollo del mismo y de las construcciones.
Con Inns and Cathedral se puede mejorar la estrategia, ya que hay más elementos que considerar.
En fin: un juego familiar, para empezar a interesarse en los eurogames. Los más fanáticos querrán luego algo más complejo.

Carcassonne is one of my favorite games. I played 24 games with "Carcassonne: 10 Year Special Edition" that I bought.

I consider this to be a classic and a must have for any collection. Carcassonne is such an easy game to teach and it is a great way to ease people into the hobby. This is how I was seduced, well this and Betrayal at House on the Hill. Carcassonne though was the first instance I had a real A-Ha moment. Placing a farmer at the perfect time upped my chances to net a win. Great game, quick, calm, I really enjoy his one.

You really can't go wrong with this at all. Cheap, fun, interesting to everyone who hasn't seen it, pretty simply rules (ok, the farms can be esoteric) good for non-gamers.

It suffers, IMHO, if people get too deeply into strategizing and out of the social element. It ain't life or death and it sure ain't Diplomacy.. just play a tile so I can have my turn... :D

One of the best light family games of the 2000's. Though it can be played with children in a constructive way it can also be played competitively against grown ups, and the game play is tense and will usually require counting VP to determine the winner.

Its iOS app is great.

RATING: 7
Resources constraints (in the form of limited meeples) and just the right amount of chance can make for some agonizing decisions. That plus accessibility and a variety of ways to win makes for a pretty good game.

The problem is that nearly every game I played back when I bought Carc came down to farmers in a sort of fixed and predictable way. Once I noticed that, I pretty much lost interest in Carc. After six years with no plays or interest in playing, I sold it.

...and then bought the winter edition because I'm a sucker for winter themes and realized what seemed like a fixed path through the game was likely due in large part to my group at the time's metagame. I like it more again now.

I enjoyed this game quite a bit the first few plays, but I feel there's not enough depth to warrant tons of play. Also some significant imbalance in pieces (iirc, churches were too powerful). Definitely worth a few plays though. Good gateway game for those new to modern board games.

RATING: 7
Being a construction worker myself, once upon a time, I love this game. I feel like the alliance/coalition building aspect of this is overlooked in most games. The best players (in my opinion) are those who treat this game NOT as a way to one-up each other and pull in-your-face! type of moves. 

Rather, the top-level performers are those who work TOGETHER to build huge castles, long roads, profitable fields, etc. Share a big couple of projects, one with each different player on the board, and they all now have an incentive to help YOU win BIG. :)

Expansions I own: 
8/10 - The Tower
7/10 - Princess and the Dragon
6/10 - The River (a slightly better way to start the game)

The simplicity of Carcassonne makes it great for gateway gamers, but the layers of strategy keep me coming back for more. This game is more than just a gateway game. Its endless replayability, colorful artwork, and cute meeples, make this game a timeless classic. And after 50 plays, it's still my favorite game of all time. :)

Carcassonne is an amusing little tile-laying game you can play quickly without too much thinking or contention.  Along with Ticket to Ride, my wife and I play it while catching up on each others' news for the day.

Copy for trade not because I don't like it, but because I have two.

RATING: 6
4 / 5 - Good

Carcassonne is an odd game. With two it's a definate strategy game at which I'm very bad, and with more it becomes more of an excercise in group art than a game. But I continue to own and play it because it's a brilliant utility game: it's easy to learn, quick to play and caters for a wide number of players and tastes. Virtually anyone can spend a fun 45 minutes playing Carcassone. So, in spite of my somewhat "meh" attitude to the game itself, this is a definite keeper.

Carcassonne has been Keith Law's number 1 game for years.  In my opinion, it is a good game, but not a great game.  I like the mechanics, the artwork is great, the play time is short and it does a good job balancing luck and skill.  When the game is over though, I don't really feel anything. It sort of just happened.  That is a personal feeling though and I wouldn't fault anyone (like Keith Law) for saying this is a great game. It just isn't for me.

RATING: 7.5
Another standard gateway game that I play with non-gamers or if people want a shorter game.

What I like:
- Pretty easy to teach.  Probably not as simple as Ticket to Ride, but still pretty simple.
- Game length is fairly short (45-60 minutes), and not much downtime between turns (if people don't try to think too hard)
- Plenty of tension in trying to get in on people's features or preventing their features from completing.
- Also plenty of cooperation (and maybe some backstabbing) when working together to complete features.
- Game complexity can be increased by introducing the expansions

What I don't like:
- Lack of control over what tile you draw (I haven't tried the hand variant).

Fun tile laying game. Few games like it. I recommend this game above nearly any other gateway boardgame because it is incredibly simple, but really gets the brain going, especially once people have had a few games behind them. It's easier to explain than Ticket to Ride or Catan, and it's a better game than both of them as well.

Carcassonne is a tile laying, and worker placement game.  On your turn you place a tile down into the play area.  The tiles depict various terrain such as cities, roads, fields, and cloisters.  To properly place the tile one of the four edges must touch, and match terrain with a tile already played.  Then you may place a worker on the tile you just placed to claim it.  Once cities, roads, and cloisters are completed, they score.   Farmer's fields score at the end.  The players with the most points at the end wins.

Carcassonne, is light.  It's usually referred to as a gateway game.  Meaning it works well introducing people to the board game hobby.  As such, I really liked it a lot when I began playing designer games.  After awhile though I found it very repetitive.  It's possible that this could be mitigated by the large number of expansions, but I never got into them.

I would recommend Carcassonne to new gamers for sure.  I'd still play it from time to time, but for the most part I've moved on to games with either more interesting mechanics, themes, or both.

Definitely a classic after all these years. I've gone through phases of disliking it, and I'm generally pretty burned out. It's just so old, it has introduced different generations soon, and we've seen so many tile-layers since. I don't dislike it though, I can play, preferably with Traders & Builders expansion as it makes the game more fun. (don't use with new players). Mega-Carcassonne (many expansions) can be fun too. 

2-Player Comment:
* Carcassonne is classic 2p game. For strategic play it's actually best player count. With more players it's bit more relaxed however. Carcassonne scales very well.

Expansions:
+Inns & Cathedrals
+Traders & Builders
+Phantom & Spielbox promo

Beautiful game, unusual in that it's a lot of fun for anywhere from 2 to 6 players. Great for all ages 4+ (though scoring needs to be done for the littlies). The brilliance is the lovely board, a unique version of which you create in the course of playing... so set-up time is very short. More strategy than you might think; my mother-in-law LOVES this game but has never beaten me, despite many dozens of plays (we play Carcassonne rather than talk!). In fairness, she does suck really badly at it - my (then) 5 year old daughter was a good match for her. Interestingly, the style of game changes dramatically as the skill of the players increases, and also with the number of players.
Has an excellent iOS app with strong AI that play very aggressively - "evil" is quite beatable, but it will require some thought.

GAMEPLAY: A tile-placement and area-control eurogame. Players take turns drawing and placing a tile. The player who placed a tile decides whether to place one of her limited supply of meeples on one of the features on the tile, hoping to score victory points later on when the feature is completed by the placement of other tile(s) or at the end of the game. The game ends after the last tile is placed. The game is improved by some of the expansions. I recommend Traders & Builders and Inns & Cathedrals in particular. I prefer to play with no more than two expansions at a time.

WEIGHT: Medium-light. The rules are not complex.

PLAYER INTERACTION/CONFLICT: High. If there are not struggles for control of large features in your game, you aren’t playing it right.

PLAYER COUNT: Scales fine from two to five players but luck increases with higher player counts. A good high-conflict two-player game.

LUCK: Moderate. Lucky tile draws can certainly determine the outcome of games. As the player count increases and each individual player necessarily draws fewer tiles throughout the game, the luck factor also increases and more games will be won by whomever happened to draw the right tile at just the right moment.

Easy enough to play and learn, but with some very subtle strategy for those willing to think ahead a few turns.  Nice balance of luck and skill.

My only complaint is that it is a game that could be expanded to death.  With so many expansions avaliable, the simplicity of the original gets lost and, even worse, it's hard when playing with people who don't always play together to decide what the rules really are, because people have their favorite expansions.

I really like Carcassonne.  Its a good game to introduce people to and can have some good strategy.  Adding in all the expansions makes the game way too long; however, as the expansions are modular you can select what you want to add for a very enjoyable experience with a subset of the total tiles released.

This game is great. The components are great, and the play is fun.  Sometimes I remove farmer scoring when teaching new players, which upsets the elegance of the game.  I prefer playing just the base game which allows for a "card counting" style play, increasing the strategic/tactical element.

Expansions add random tiles and, in my opinion, unnecessary complexity to a beautiful design.  However, I do like playing with and without the River Expansion. Helps keep the variety in the game.

A pretty game of realm building and resource competition via worker placement. Not tactically deep but can get tense.

Great fun sabotaging people trying to build cities, cutting off farmers. This is a malicious game that works great if you've a group who like to screw each other over. Only thing is that I don't feel the expansions really add anything, I've stuck with the base game.

This game was the best gateway game for my family of "Boardgame Haters", it has since converted most of them. Also, this is my Dad's favorite game by far, and has become a frequent request of his. That is a big deal. 

Also, we RARELY, RARELY, RARELY play with the 'Farmer" ability, since no one wants to be in charge of the scoring of it at the end of the game. I know it is lazy, but we enjoy the game much more without the farming meeples.

Carcassonne was one of the early games that got me back into board games, especially Euros and strategy games. This Big Box was a natural purchase after we had exhausted the basic game. Actually thought, only Traders and Builders has really stood up for us. The Dragon one is no fun (we don't like the slower, lower scoring game) and the others seem too fiddly. Still a great one to have on the shelf though.

Quick (30-60 min.), fun, and great for 2-5 players. No 2 games are the same and strategy (what little there is) changes constantly. Very random game with heavy emphasis on speculation (i.e. will this move pay off later?) Good light-game for families or casual gamers. Light enough that my wife loves this one, and usually beats me (which enhances its appeal to her). We play with the Traders & Builders and Inns & Cathedrals expansions which enhance player interaction, competitiveness, and strategy... and time (each expansion adds 30 minutes).

This is a really good game. Really easy to learn and kind of hard to master. 
Played many times, up to a point that i know the number of some tiles. This makes the game even more hardcore when playing against a player that also knows how many tiles of a specific design exist.

The bishop expansion is absolutely garbage ! No idea how the creators of this game could name as "extra content" the bishops ...

A fantastic tile laying game! Carcassonne was one of my "initiation" games and subsequently I've fostered a love of tile laying mechanics ever since. A quick 30-45 minute game with frequent combat with light strategy and tactics that plays well at all levels. However, if I had anything negative to say about the game is that for the same price point the quality of the board is not comparable to those of other companies/games.

Played it with 4-players, together with 3 expansions. My wife and our mutual friends really like this game. I love playing this game with them, but I find the game itself not really meaningful (for me it's draw a tile, place a tile and a token, yeah, score, etc.). I know that this last comment can be said about any game. But I don't have any control on what tiles I get. The only thing you can decide is where to place a tile and whether or not you place a token on it to score. The mechanic just doesn't do it for me.

I do like the expansions, so this game (with expansions) wins it from Hunters and Gatherers: I adjusted the rating. And I love the art, especially that of a finished game.

Our gateway game, and one we still still gladly play from time to time. Anna and I play in a very cutthroat manner, usually including the 1st expansion. We like the 2nd expansion a little less, since we rather compete for cities and roads than for resources, although we see the appeal of having the other player compromising and finishing your city. Lately, "Carc: The Castle" has replaced vanilla Carc for us somewhat, but we'll see how that one holds up after repeated plays.

Edit 01-15: After nine months of gaming, this is already a bit on the "too light" side for us. Doesn't see much play anymore, except when we introduce it to newbies.

Caracassonne and 5 expansions. This is a really cool set. The problem we have with the game is that you are supposed to stack the tiles in x piles, but you can pick from any pile on any turn. Well, the tiles are slippery, it would work better to just have all the tiles in a bag and you draw from the bag. But the game itself is great (I do have a tendency to lose meeples by trying to build cities that get out of control).

It has been said before but this truly is a great gateway game.  The rules are relatively straight forward, even though some people find the farmers a bit confusing.  Almost anyone can play but there is enough subtletities to keep me interested.  I really prefer base Carcassonne without expansions.  I guess I burned out on expansions back in my Talisman/CE days.

Also, one of my fav ways to play are two player with a chess clock.  Just add four or five minutes per side.  Awesome.

01/17/02 Bought the 2000 edition. Love it. A great gateway game. You can either "play nice" with newbies, showing them where they can help themselves the most. Or the screwage factor can be very high if you want to try to hinder as many of your experienced opponent's structures as possible, or glom on when the opportunity arises. 
As of 12/20/17 I've played 116 games, the majority with an expansion (or two).

08/15/17 Played using the new edition, and its Abbot expansion. The abbot was a nice edition.  Though I have no idea what fields have to do with being an abbot.  I did find a lot of the incidental artwork on the new edition tiles distracting as it was 2-3 times the size of the old version's minor artwork (pig pens, sheep corrals, and the most annoying, buildings around road intersections). Also, a few of the roads were yellow. Huh?

A favourite as everyone likes this - even people who say they don't like games...

Saying that, it's come in for a bit of a pasting on BGG recently. I don't care, I still think it's great. And what do the people on BGG know anyway?

I mean, I'm here and I don't know much...

... but I do know what I like. We've played this a lot.

I have yet to play this one with expansions, but people often say that expansions make it way better. It is already a very good game, so that would be amazing!
I like the theme, the artwork (simple as it is), the tile laying gameplay. You can be ambitions and go for massive, risky structures or play it safe and score many small amounts of points. If you're clever with peasant placement you can steal points that other player's would have gotten at the end of the game without them noticing before it is too late! This is quintessential Euro-gaming to me: Elegant, decently strategic, replayable and lightly themed. No bloat in the design. There is exactly the amount of components to it that there needs to be; no more, no less.
I rate it less than perfect because: (1) Maybe it is true that expansion will make it better so I need to try that for myself. (2) I'm still new enough to board games that I prefer to leave some head room for future favourites, score wise.

Carcassonne is in my opinion played best with only two players and without any expansions. It gets very competitive and interesting in this setting. Players have to constantly consider which tiles are left in the piles and place their tiles accordingly. Blocking your opponent with your tiles becomes a very good strategy. The game is also fun with more players and expansions but it becomes much more casual.

Original one. In 2002 I got my copy of this game and it's the game that was my gateway to boardgaming. I've played it over and over again - it's still good, but nowadays there are so many better games out there - with todays standards it could be something like 7, but you gotta give some credit for the time it lasted.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Random, but fun game. Good choice for a fast game with 3+ players. The random draw of cards can be somewhat factored out by providing the players with a list of the available tiles, to figure out how much chance you have to complete your road, city or church territories.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The learned types who study the tiles, watch what has come out & therefore know what is still in the bag will always do better than the plonker who just plays his tiles as they come.

Remove 20% of the tiles randomly before the game would take away the memory retention aspects of the game & thus for the average plonker, this would improve the game immensely.

However, with all that said, it's probably one of the best gateway games about, certainly one of the most successful at any rate.

Just drawing a tile is a bit too random for my taste. I prefer the variant where there is a row of five tiles available, which cost 0,1,2,3,4 points to take.

Grandfather of entry-level tile placement titles, but one that remains still fun to play ten years later. Mechanics bordering on genius in its simplicity. Some expansions a must, but caveat emptor, some others detract from the game! Highly recommended for bringing new victims into the hobby (and much superior to Settlers of Cataan!), recommended as a light filler otherwise, but beware for potentially too long play times for a game of the level of shallowness.

A family favorite.  Love to play it.  Good for aggressive and passive play.   My favorite game to introduce new people to my collection of games they have never heard of.  My wife prefers it over many games with different end conditions because you always know when the game will end - when the tiles are gone.  After playing it for a couple of years, I had to bump it up to a 10 - I don't see it losing its luster at all.

Why does everybody seem to like this game so much?

To me this game seems to play itself. Even when I win I don't enjoy playing it. Maybe I should try this with more than 2 players? But then the downtime just increases...

Update: my rating seems to drop a point for every play... 

NL: populair legspel waar ik geen klap aan vind. Ook niet als ik win, wat ik meestal doe. Extreem saai als je tegenstander lang loopt te twijfelen waar hij/zij het volgende stukje zal neerleggen en jij je dus ondertussen verveelt. Veel mensen vinden 'm blijkbaar leuk, terwijl er -tig betere spellen zijn.

Definitely a good gateway game.  Easy to understand with reasonable amounts of strategy for advanced gamers.  Can suffer from virtual player elimination if someone is heavily invested in a large city that doesn't get completed.  Not a game that we usually play unless there are new people around, but it definitely works well as an introduction game.

The game that started it all for me.  Found an online implementation of it, enjoyed it, so brought the Big Box home.  It was Meg's favorite game until Dominion took over.  We played it a LOT when we first got it, and I got a little tired of it.  I enjoy it a lot more now that we only play it every few months.  We always play with at least the I&C and T&B expansions, and then we'll throw in another one sometimes.  I like that there's just enough thinking to keep it interesting without it being too deep.  I like that it can play friendly or nasty.  Easy to teach to others.  Great gateway game!

For some reason my interest in this has waned a bit. Probably due to more games being available to be played now. I'm sure this will be back on the table soon. 

Oddly it has been quite a while now w/o much play. Perhaps just better titles to spend the time with?

Finally got this back on the table and it will probably come back out a few more times soon. A lot of nice tactical and strategical thinking while trying to cope with the luck of the draw. Much fun.

RATING: 8.2
OK this game is definitely different and plays very lightly so I can see the general appeal. However, I just don't find it that engaging or addictive. It's not exciting and there seems to be a major lack of competition until near the end if the game is especially close. Also, the last few turns take forever as players search for the absolute best spot. Pretty much the person who takes the longest and explores the most options is probably going to win.

Some of my girl gaming friends seem to really like this game, and it's usually the most requested.

It's a good little game, but really leaves me wanting more strategy.

2012 UPDATE: Still a great family game that still gets played and requested. We usually play without farms to keep it simple. We play with Bridges, and with all of the tiles from expansions, whether we use the additional rules or not (depends who we're playing with)

RATING: 6
As cut-throat and tense as the group wants to play it. Sure, you can be screwed by the draw and your opponents can have everything fall in their laps, but that's true for most games I play - and on the whole, you have more influence on the outcome than not.

I'm eager to try the expansions Inns & Cathedrals, and Traders & Builders, as they seem to add some interesting dynamics to the game while not pushing the complexity too far from the original.

Easy game to play with anyone, but it still has enough to consider for people who enjoy more complex games. Works great with the whole range of players as well (though preferably not more than 4 I'd say) - so that's also a plus. 

A great game!

UPDATE: Played with Inns & Cathedrals, Traders & Builders and the River. Unsure about the River but otherwise these two take the game up a couple of notches, absolutely recommended!

keeper basic vanilla version only:Harsh Marking here, I quite like it but no one else ever has.
must be owned but not played much...see expansions for score
carc the city is our carc winner, puts me off ever expanding this game...though i do liek the sounds of some of the expanzions i think all the extra tiles and rule might be to much to handle nto played much any how

Ive custom sourted my tiles, no cathedrals, replaced normal road tiles with roads with inns on tiles, and normal monestrues for the new monestaires, so the tile count is the same as orginal but a few funkcy new tiles, and 1 new rule for road scoring and the new big meeple. 

Didnt like the other expansions, but then only pla 2 player realy.

RATING: 6

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Game in a Nutshell: Build cities, roads, and farms by laying one tile at a time. Then place a marker (meeple) to claim it as your own so long as it doesn't belong to someone else. Finish your claims and score points or mess with other people trying to finish theirs. Most points win.

Played as: 2,3,4,5 player (xbox live: 2,4,5)

Played with: Plain; Inns & Cathedrals; Traders & Builders; Inns & Cathedrals + Princess & the Dragon; Inns & Cathedrals + The River II; Inns & Cathedrals + Princess & the Dragon + The River II.

Pros: Big love to a light quicker game that plays well with a smaller group (2-3). My favorite part of the game is how any tile can be used for your gain or an opponents demise. And it's up to you to weigh out so many options in a wide open environment. Few games feel like art in motion, this is one of them as you watch the board grow with every tile. It's like the swiss army knife of games: use it as a fill-in while waiting for a larger crowd to gather for a meatier game; play back-to-back with a friend, you name it and this game will work for the occasion.

Cons: Like most tile-laying games (abstract by nature), it didn't have that instant click that makes a person excited to try it again. This, I think, somewhat diminishes its gateway appeal as compared to SoC or TTR. 

Other: The least luck-based of all the euro gateways. With it's less appealing abstract nature strongly countered by a less luck driven, more intimate (better with less players) feel, this is really a gateway game of a different less social breed. The game's interest will die off if played casually while longer life can be achieved with aggressive play.

Best Use: Works for almost any occasion-- warm-up, filler, 2-3 player gateway, single session time killer, etc.

This games a little bit too light for me. I feel this game is more of a "beer and pretzel" type game and it doesn't really keep players to focused. You can develop some nice strategies with tile and meeple placement, however it's hard to keep my non-gamer friends interested because it's hard for them to see an overall goal in tile and meeple placement. I do enjoy this game time to time though when in the right mood. Need to try it with more expansions because I feel they would make this game more tense and exciting.

I used to think this game was too simple and (mostly) luck-based. Then I played a few game on Carcassonne iPad app. Boy, was I wrong... 
This game is a strategic masterpiece hidden behind a cute, relaxing theme. It's also much more evil than most people can imagine, at least when played optimally. There is LOTS of skill in basic (no expansions) 2-player game, obviously with more players the luck factor increases.
Have you ever tried to get into the someone's big city, or even a road? Have you ever placed your tile(s) in such a way so as to minimize opponent's chances of filling in a big city or road? Do you know how and when to place your farmers? (bad farmer placement can easily lose you the game) Do you know the distribution of the tiles and take it into consideration when deciding on your move?
Guess what - strong players CONSISTENTLY do all of the above and are able to post very impressive win rates. Even if you know some (or all) of these concepts you'll still get trashed (in the long run) by someone who employs them better than you.

Well, it's okay for what it is. The rules are pretty easy to get into, although the scoring (especially the end-game scoring) probably requires more than one play to really get a handle on. Like most Euros, it really doesn't make a lot of sense as far as what you're doing--what, are cities and roads falling out of the sky or something? I'd play this occasionally. Better yet, rarely.

It's a more than adequate poster child for the "meh" that is the Eurogame. This is really the game that convinced me that most of the "classic" Euros are essentially children's games with elaborate scoring systems.

This game is severely underrated. I realize that BGG members are generally hardcore boardgamers, and they tend to look down on "gateway games." This game is fantastic: elegant and easy in style and mechanics, yet the gameplay is different every time thanks to the random tile draw. I love playing it with hardcore and casual gamers alike. I love that my four-year-old was able to pick up the game mechanics and strategy (no reading) and play better every time. Great game.

Rating based mostly on 2 players with the expansions Inns & Cathedrals.

Fast and easy to teach, more strategic with 2 players. Nice tiles but the theme is poor and I would probably play abstract strategic games (like chess) instead if there is a chance.  

Sold because not enough interesting as 2 players game and we prefer party games with more players.

Wonderful tile laying and worker placement game. Absolutely recommended for family game night although may be beyond the reach of kids under 12. Great for adults, too! The instructions are simple and concise, but the game has many layers of depth to it. 

The random draw for the tiles and then the matching aspect of the tile laying combined with the meeple placement make for a new and different game each time. 

Scoring can be a bit tricky and may require a reference to the instructions during the first few games, but once played through, the mechanics really make for a fun experience.

With dozens of simple, yet deep expansions available for the base game (~$35USD) the themes and variety seem to be endless. 

Well worth the purchase and will stay on my game shelves for years to come.

A nice game: my wife's favorite and the most-often-played for two years running.  We have several expansions, which we use from time to time.  Plays pretty fast, but the more expansions you add, the more random the final scoring turns out to be.

A nice light family game that has enough depth in it to still be interesting on repeated plays.  It's not difficult to play it in a "nice" way when teaching others.  But it's still possible to play it more cut-throat if playing with experienced people.  A classic gateway game.

If I'd started logging plays 5 years earlier, this would probably have another 20 plays against it.  The expansions would as well, but to a lesser degree.

While not as popular with my group as some of the other Euros ... this game is always challenging and enjoyable.  It is clever, sufficiently complex for serious players and has a plane of "simplicity" available for the not-too-serious players.  Length and depth is good for a starter or mid-weight finisher for a games night.  Also good when there's only two of you.  I'll never say no to an offer of a game of Carcassone!

People don't seem to believe me when I tell them I don't like Carcassonne.  I can't really put my finger on why, it just doesn't click with me.  I think it's the gambling involved in the farmers that makes me annoyed - the fact that suddenly one player leaps so far ahead after the game is finished, when everyone was competitive until then.

(Mind you, I can at least be badgered into it.  I do not think that is true about most Eurogames.)

Everyone who has come up to a session of this always wants to know what it is, how to play it and once they learn, how much it costs.  The rules are eo elegant and simple and yet the strategy can be so complex.  Every family that enjoys games should have a copy.  Every gamer should as well.  I'll be playing this when I'm 80.  Though I wish the 50/100-point tiles and the bag in the expansions came with the base game.

[u]08-Jan-2013[/u]: This is the game that introduced me to this hobby, and perhaps because of that, it is (and likely will always be) my favorite game.  This hits basically all of my gaming wants: tiles, modular board, good components, puzzle-like, easily played solitaire (either solo multiplayer or with the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/41710/soloplay_carcassonne_wexpansions_v1-pdf]SoloPlay variant[/url], which I love), aesthetically pleasing, variety.  To me, it's all in there.

This is another game Mrs Mo actually enjoys (in it's "vanilla" form) but our girls don't as much.  I really wish my wife would play 2P games with me, because this one would be our go to.  It's fairly simple (the farmer scoring seems to mess a little with the people I play with).  It looks good on the table as you build the landscape with various cities and roads.  It's got meeples!  It has strategy but in that light (vanilla Carc) to light-mid (with I&C added) range.

If you want to go crazy, there are numerous expansions that add all kinds of things.  I am content with Inns & Cathedrals as it adds just that little extra strategy and gameriness (how's that for a made up word) to make it that much more fun and challenging.

Highly recommended all around.

[u]24-Jan-2014[/u]: Still my favorite game despite not really having anyone to play against.  I play a lot using the iOS app vs various AIs so that kind of gives me my fix.  Otherwise, I play mostly with various solo variants.  Just really enjoy this game.

[u]The Solo Variants[/u]:
[listitem=1129534]SoloPlay Variant[/listitem]
This is my favorite way to play solo.  The SoloPlay variants aren't for everyone as some of them have some funky setups and additional rules for gameplay and scoring, but I really enjoy them.  This one can be used with just the base game, or with one or both of the first two expansions (I&C and T&B), or with or without the River.  So lots of options.  It alters all the scoring and adds new ways to score, so it takes a few plays to get it.  But I really like it.

[thread=361708]Carc Island[/thread]
This is a more straightforward variant.  Basically just build within a specified grid and score as usual.  It's much quicker than the SoloPlay variant.  But I found if you add in expansions, it becomes more luck of the draw as there are too many for the grid size.

[listitem=2310292]Byron's Solo Variant[/listitem]
And this is a fun one for something a little different.  It rewards you for building larger cities and roads rather than a bunch of smaller ones.  Pretty neat variant.  I've only played it a few times, but I like that the focus is a different here.

So, I've been thinking - I really ought to play this more. In the time between turns, I could finish my thesis. And with all the expansions, a game could take several weeks.

Most viable for two because of this, and  while I recognize that there is a backgammon-like element of trying to make sure that you have a good move no matter what the next tile is, in general I don't have a lot of patience for the passivity of the draw-one-tile-then-play-it games. Of course, the Carcasonnes are prettier than backgammon, which helps a little.

Vanilla Carc though is just well, vanilla. Almost no tension, and I tire of it. I don't play games just to kill time. Hunters and Gatherers is a significant improvement, but even that I don't want to play with more than two.

A good game and something I will always go to first when playing with people that don't game often. However, the farming game irritates the hell out of me. New players can never grasp it their first couple games, which ensures they never win, and it just feels like more of a chore every time I play. Having it be so absolutely vital to winning yet the only move that limits your options means the more your group grasps the importance, the more time they'll spend focused on it, and the less fun the game will be overall.

I love the fact that every game is different and that you may need to change strategy at some point during the game depending on the map lay-out.

Very fun and easy intro game. Quality of the tiles are very good. The expansion I have added (1-3) add a lot a depth and make the game more competitive. The game can last a bit too long and there is not much for other players to do when it is not their turn, so downtime is high. I mostly play this game in its app form now.

Easy to play and easy to teach casual players. I like this game - especially when you play the tactical version (three tiles in hand).
Using the expansion is a necessity when playing Carcassone. The rating of 7 is if using Carcassonne as a standalone game.

RATING: 9
This game is very simple, both to teach and to play. Players take turns and draw a tile and connect it to the existing map then may place a “meeple” to try and determine control of certain key positions for points. The player with the most points after the last tile is played is the winner! Slight complications arise with scoring rules but it’s nothing terribly complex. That said there could be very deep strategies involved playing this game and choices where to place tiles and Meeples become crucial. There’s not a lot of player interaction and it’s usually light in confrontation but can be played more aggressively as players vie for control over certain types of structures and areas on the map. A great, flexible game that can be taken as seriously as you wish. 

Some of the expansions add some interesting wrenches into the mix and spice things up! Always a good “go to” game and I have had very successful sessions of using Carcassonne as a “gate way” game to other, more complex offerings. Very highly recommended! Truly, a must have!

After Settlers of Catan and Ticket to Ride, this was our third real "gamers" game.  I love this game and some of the expansions are very good, but we kind of got burned out by overplaying this game with multiple expansions at the same time, which made for a lot to keep track of.  We recently played this again with just the river and inns/cathedrals and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Excellent physical-space game.

Place map tiles and meeples to complete map features for most points.

Plays: More than a dozen?
Type: VP race = a game where you race to collect victory points (fastest/most).
Complexity: Family game = A game that is easy to teach and play.
# of players: 2-5.
Playing time: 30 mins.
Player interaction: Can be played without interaction. Competitive play will involve competition for scarce resources and opportunity prevention. These become more pronounced with 2 players, making the game less family and more strategy.
Randomness: Medium - tile draw.

Replayability: Not so high, usually this serves as a starter or a filler.
Fun: A bit of fun to complete your map features.
Memorability: Not really.

Thematic integration: Workable, with broad appeal.
Components: Iconic. The original Meeple.

Who will like this: Everyone. A must have in every game collection.

One of my best friends ALWAYS wants to play Carc- has all the expansions. Most of my other friends never want to SEE Carc again.

I think this is the first game to use meeples. So that's something!

Simple strategy and competition, though get ready to do some zany addition at the end.

The draw-one-play-one format eliminates some strategic elements, replacing them with chance. Try it when plays have 3 tiles each, getting to choose one to play.

Good for what it is- light fun. Playing very competitively can be frustrating for players as its usually just- who will draw the key piece. Definitely benefits from a couple expansions.

"the emperor has no clothes!" - this is not a particularly clever game, and certainly doesn't work with multiple people ("how can I place a tile that helps NOBODY but myself" and "now I have to wait until my turn to help myself more").  Certainly shows its age in light of new additions (like RK's "the castle") but if you are going to throw tiles, why not play ENTDECKER that adds a little more substance and mood?

This is my current favorite, but only when played with a few of the expansions.  It is a good, solid game that is relatively easy to teach newer players and has enough complexity to keep us thinking.  I like that more tiles can be added to make the game longer.  Major objections: the luck is hard for some people to handle and "sharing" features can unbalance a game.

Very nice tile placement game that is great for non-to-serious gamers.  My parents love playing it while still being entertaining for me.

EDIT: After many, many more plays I've come to appreciate this game more and more. The game's dynamic can be friendly and light all the way to darn cut-throat depending on the group of people playing.  A go-to for me with new gamers.  A game that can really stand the test of time and repeated plays.  Still not something I would want to play if I was looking for a "serious" game night, but rather something I will gladly play if I want to sit down and relax with friends or family. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Gets newcomers amused by the pretty little bits. Decent filler.  Fun to talk about the map you're building.  Less strategic with a larger group, but if you're playing with fewer, there are just so many games with a comparable playtime that outshine this.

3/3/2014: I've recently played with some righteous Carcassonne-defenders, who insist it's a much more nuanced beast once you've memorized the frequencies of different tile elements, and know the odds of your plays/blocks working out.  Fine.  True of many games.  I still don't see reason enough to spend the time it takes to reach that point on this one.

Carcassonne is just ok for me. I like it pretty well and I play it pretty well it's just not something I would normally choose to play.

Carcrashone is pretty fun. Everytime I play Cascarone the experience is different. Even when you play with the same people, Carcassarole can show you new ways to play. With strategies being picked up and dropped on the fly, Cascarane can swing wildly but it's never a shocker. You could be behind significantly and still manage to pull ahead with some clever capitalization in this, the game of Casablancaonne.

I understand but don't quite buy into this game's wide appeal; playing with more than three is deadly dull. Nevertheless, I've played my share of games, mostly two player, and have no intention of ever trading it away. The Inns and Cathedrals expansion is a must add-on, and Knizia's [i]Carcassonne: the Castle[/i] (7) is a very good variation on the Carc theme.  Nice the way the expansions and Castle can all fit in the original Carcassonne box. Oh, and one more thing: I think that green color burned my retinae. [27  plays]

Update: Recently bought the River II expansion, which simply but effectively improves the beginning of the game.

RATING: 7
The more I've played this the more I like it... so subtle and beautiful and really unlike anything else I own. Those that complain it is too simple, too abstract, or too uninteresting are themselves too simple and too uninteresting. With the right ruthless opponent (like my wife) this game becomes an excruciating competition of area control, and essentially gambling as you weigh the benefits of placing a meeple for scoring much later against the possibility you will not draw the tile you need, or have your opponent place a tile in a position to prevent you from completing your plans. Best with 2 only, since it becomes pure competition. Also, it doesn't really become a pure game until both players are familiar enough with all the pieces (the way one becomes familiar with the 52 cards in a standard playing card deck) that each decision of placement (tile and meeple) becomes educated based on knowledge of future potential. Not worth playing without the Inns & Cathedrals expansion.

People complain about how the farmers determine the game, which is probably true. I'd like to try the newer versions of this game which likely help balance it some more.  A good "advanced" game still accessible to novice players, I think.

This is one of the best game designs of the last twenty years. It takes a basic tile placing mechanism, adds color and personality, and links it to a fine scoring system. Indeed, the scoring system is so good that it has spawned several dozen interesting variants. I'm not sure this is the "best" of the Caracassonnes and I play other versions much more frequently, but it is the first one, the groundbreaker, and it deserves a 10 for blazing the path!

I'd bought this game about 3-4 years ago, and we'd played it once in that intervening time (I got stomped, and I wasn't so thrilled about bringing it back out to play).

In 10/2006, I dragged the game out and we (a friend, my wife and I) decided to give it a try again.  I learned two things:  this game is really rather good, and don't annoy my wife.

The game is the classic tile laying game, so it really needs no introduction.  If everyone knows how to play it (and can get past the rules, which constantly change the name of the figures you have and so make it hard at first to understand), the game is rather fun.  Unfortunately, we were a little hazy on the farm part, and so when my friend put down a farmer, my wife got really annoyed that she'd now pretty much lost the game before it started.  In spite of me trying to point out that there were plenty of opportunities to get back in the game, my wife remained annoyed at me until we played a game of Settlers (in which she stomped all over us).

What I've been tempted to do with the rules is to cross out the terms "thief", "farmer", "knight", and "abbot/monk" and replace them with "meeple" to make for easier reading.

Since that day in October 2006, my wife and I have played many times, and now that we have some strategy down, the game is really rather fun.

(EDIT: Aug 22, 2007): We don't get this game out to play that much these days, and when we do, it's usually a fallback filler type of game.  I'm bumping the number down to 6 accordingly.

Thought it was almost trivial at first, but over nearly two years it keeps improving.  Great for the little ones and the old ones; good with serious gamers as well as noobs.

I love the aggression this game can bring out, as players repeatedly hijack big cities and fields.  I don't often use it as a gateway game, though.

One of the older games in our collection but still a classic one that shouldbe missed in anyone's cupboard! And it is the only game my mother really likes to play over and over and over again. Very low profile but still enjoyable and with enough tactical decisions to be made. And after you've played the game, the organically grown map of cities always looks so nice that you want to make a picture of it! We recently bought the big box 4 to make it a little bit more challenging and gave the base game to my mother as this is the only game she keeps on playing again and again.

Over time I had accidentally allowed the glut of expansions and their subsequent substantial increase in game length to cause me to forget what a great game Carcassonne is.

If you've forgotten, too, use one of the online tile references to strip your collection of all the add-on extra tiles, and enjoy a heated 30 minute 2-player game with the opponent of your choice.

It was like hearing back from an old friend.

I love this game. Its only real flaw is farmer scoring, which is too complicated (at least until you've played enough games for it to make sense). That takes it down several notches. A pretty good gateway game, but with enough complexity to get people to see there is more to board gaming than monopoly.

When I meet non-gamers at work & discuss hobby games, they invariably say: "I've played Carcasonne & I don't think strategy games are for me." I'm surprised to see how many people have been turned off of gaming because of Carcasonne!  It is a good tile-placement game, but for me, I'd rather add in an auction and play Vikings.

+1 light. easy setup, short teaching time. 
+1 Initially strategy seems extremely shallow, but a little more meta strategy reveals itself with a few of plays. 

-1 Huge amount of random chance. 
-1 lots of my turns involve no meaningful choices or actions ('oh boy, another straight road piece...spare merson? yup... goes here then...')
-.5 what deeper strategy there is only comes with meta knowledge (how many of this tile is there, etc) or random chance
-1 Scoreboard is often meaningless, as final tally can feel almost random ('oh, I  won?') or meaningless if folks are paying attention. 

Takes too long to be a filler-game, but fills time with atable of very new/attention-scarce players. Bores me to tears if played more than once in a blue moon. 

I suspect a few expansions, or min-maxing with some very competitive players might make this a little more enjoyable.

I bought this game since it was recommended as a simple gateway game. I figured it would be east to introduce, especially to people who are new to board games. I didn't expect to like this game as much as I did.

There is a lot of tactical and strategic depth to this game. Thinking about the best place to put a tile, evaluating the chances of being able to finish the mega-city for lots of points, rationing your meeples, cutting off your opponent, maneuvering your position in order to contest features. It's a very fun game - I enjoy it most with 2-3 players but it plays very nicely with more. 

The game is satisfying to play, and offers a lot more fun and depth than I gave it credit for. Now if only Inns and Cathedrals would be restocked...

Carcassonne was one of those games that sparked my enthusiasm for board gaming. Tile laying, placing meeples and collecting points from finished constructions is easy and rewarding. If you concentrate only in finishing your own castles, roads and monasteries, it can be very kind and non confrontational game. It is possible to play this game also more aggressively so that you try actively outplay your opponent, sabotgae their constructions or steal their victory points with meeple offensive. 
I think it never gets so old that I don`t want to play it at all.

Szuper játéknak tartom, és az egyik legtutibb belépőnek a társasok világába.

Nem nehéz játék, az egyesével történő lapka húzás miatt némi szerencsével, de az alkotás mindig örömmel tölti el az embert.

Carcasonne ist ein zeitloser Klassiker, mit einem Spielprinzip, dass sehr oft versucht wurde zu adaptieren oder zumindest in einem größeren Gesamtkonstrukt zu verwenden. Die Rede ist natürlich davon, Geländeplättchen passend aneinander zu legen, damit so eine stimmige und hübscheLandschaft entsteht, denn das macht man in Carcassonne. Man zieht ein Geländeplättchen, legt es passend an und stellt ggf noch einen seiner Meeple auf das eben gelegte Plättchen - das war´s! siegpunkte gibt esdann für fertig gestellte Städte, Straßen, Klöster und Wiesen. Ein eifnaches, aber tollen Spiel, was bis heute nichts von seinem Charme verloren hat.

Along with TTR, Carcassonne introduced me to the world of modern board games.  It's a simple, tile-laying game.  I enjoy playing it from time to time but it can often leave players a little frustrated as you are at the complete mercy of the tile draw.  This leaves next to no room for long term planning.  I would still recommend it, providing you take it for what it is, a high luck, family game.  Good but not great.

Love this game. It's not stressful at all. The only randomness comes from drawing tiles, however the only strategy comes from where you decide to place them. It's a casual game that can involve a lot of forethought and strategy, but won't cause everyone to hate each other like Catan can.

Good gateway game to real boardgames. I like the overall gameplay, it is fluid. The game gets quite heavy with more than 3 players and my favorite amount of players is 2-3.

RATING: 6
Putting on the trade block.  Any trade would need to include all the Carcasone Expansions.

This game has been primarily identified for family gameplay, and has worked with ages 5 to 70+.  We're ready to integrate expansions, but recently, the preference has always been for something else at game time.

***update 1/30/2014
Dropping rating to a 6.  I have tons of games I'd rather play.  I need to look Carcassonne in the eye and say "It's not you, it's me".

A great gateway game, and it grows in strategy with each expansion included. Learn it in 5 minutes, play it for life.

RATING: 6
Pleasantly undemanding, and easy to teach. And in any given crowd probably a lot of people have played it anyway so you don't have to worry about teaching it. And that's about it. Also, I like any game that involves building something--that has a creative/constructive element.

I can't fathom why you'd invest in expansions, but whatever. I like shorter games.

I like that this game is easy to teach and seems to be a good game to introduce players to board gaming.  There wasn't enough going on to keep me interested.  Maybe some of the expansions address that problem.

I'll play it but I didn't really enjoy it or look forward to playing it again.  My wife loved it of course which means I'll probably wind up owning it.

I'm liking this more and more as the years go by.  It's sort of a standard work horse in terms of pub games.  Just throw it in the bike bag along with the darts and you're good to go.

Too long for a simple filler and too light and random to be interesting. It has just enough difficult choices to make it a good gateway for casual gamers who would otherwise inflict Monopoly on their friends. Its also light enough to make it a good social/family game. A bit dull with two players, better with 3-4.

I got this game after hearing about its reputation but unfortunately my group is kind of split on this one.  Alot of them aren't too fond of it and the rest think its alright.

RATING: 8
Base game is OK.  Rating is for game + expanisons.  Really comes to life with Traders and Builders expansion.  And Inns & Cathedrals makes roads more interesting, along with giving you some more interesting tiles.  I just played with these expansions along with the River and Heretic expansions (not critical), and can honestly say it was the first game of Carcassonne that I found to be fun & enjoyable.  I'm actually looking forward to my next game instead of approaching it with skepticism.

This is probably one of my all time favorite games. You really have to think about where you're placing what so that you can get the appropriate amount of points. In addition Carcassonne can get kind of competitive, but very fun. The meeples, I think, make Carcassonne what it is. Without the meeples it would not truly be Carcassonne.

Revised score as I just have too many games I prefer to play.

Carcassonne is a very nice looking game that is easy to teach and has across-the-board appeal to almost every generation and style of gamer.Carc can be played light and fluffy or cutthroat and nasty stealing points and blocking cities at every chance.

主題:1
我第二款購入的桌遊，套用中古世紀的城堡--卡卡頌，藉由卡卡頌伯爵建設家園的主題來包裝的拼圖遊戲，拼圖遊戲我們都有玩過，但能在拼圖中加入計分規則與遊戲主題帶入感，卡卡頌真的做到了。此外，除了在拼圖外，還融入工人放置的機制，讓整個主題更加完美!(伯爵的手下)，不管是當農夫、當路霸收錢、當傳教士、還是城堡內的騎士，配合地圖的開展，還真有開疆拓土的味道!

美術:0.9
這款美術與農家樂一樣!簡單的線條外加淺色調的彩繪，美術看起來十分有童趣，說真的這一類有強烈主題的歐式遊戲，若改搭美式漫畫風格或寫實風格就真的就格格不入了，我喜歡這一款的美術!至於米寶工人，我不知道起源在那一款遊戲!但我接觸到的桌遊!好像卡卡頌的米寶最具知名度，令人印象深刻!

規則:0.9
抽圖板、擺放圖板(拼圖)、放置工人、換對手，就是這麼簡單的流程，除了要將最後的農夫計分講解清楚外!其他工人的計分方式都十分直覺，教學上也十分容易，除了擴充有一大堆不同規則要消化外，基本上款這遊戲的規則讓遊戲流程十分順暢!

設置:1
這是一款設置容易的遊戲!我喜歡攻城塔的擴充配件，把圖板全部放置攻城塔上，圖板抽完遊戲結束，十分實用的小配件!(尤其是一大堆擴充圖板不知要如何取捨時)

路線:0.4
基本上就是看你抽到板塊的運氣，來選擇要用那種工人取分，得分路線不多(擴充增加部分得分路線，但相對的也給遊戲增加複雜度，造成遊戲規則太多特例影響遊戲流暢度)，有時抽牌運氣不是很好的時候，你會發現你會被卡很久!

互動:0.8
基本上我覺得卡卡頌是兩人遊戲，雖然遊戲可以2-6人(加擴充)但人越多玩家閒置發呆的情形就更明顯，尤其要在一大片拼圖中，找出可以放置手上這片板塊的位置，有時真的要找好久!加上多人遊戲中，大家互相卡來卡去，越多人就越卡，真的變成卡卡不爽的遊戲了!所以我推薦本款兩人玩最佳人數!不過三人局也可以試試，玩起來會更有合眾連橫的政治角力感覺!

個人:0.8
我是很推薦這款遊戲，想等小朋友長大點就教他玩這款遊戲，可以訓練觀察力、也好過單人玩需要大量時間又無代入感的拼圖遊戲!(這句話得罪很多拼圖愛好者)

朋友:0.8
我跟我老婆玩兩人場，老婆說十分有趣，跟同事玩五人場，大家只想草草結束，我想這款還是兩人專用就好!雖然同事並無惡評，但我想大家會更想玩別的。(挑人數開很重要)最近跟5歲的女兒玩兩人局，小朋友愛的反應出乎我意料之外，女兒常說要開卡卡頌，而且要玩不同的擴充。學校桌遊社教學，大部分的小朋友也很喜歡。

想玩:0.8
玩了很多重度策略類型的遊戲，偶爾會想試試這款輕度桌遊，享受你卡我我卡你的樂趣!

收藏:1
擴充很多，每款都替這遊戲帶來不同的變化，說實在的這款遊戲不容易玩膩，我會想好好收藏!

總分:8.4
講評:兩人互卡、三人眾橫、四人等等、五人等等等、六人等等等等等!好遊戲?我會說是經典遊戲!

I find this one deceptively deep, and underappreciated. I find that with the right group of players, this one can be a real brain-burner. Lately, have been getting it to the table and loving it vanilla with the 'Play a hand of three tiles' variant.(When played this way, 9.5 for this one) It adds some simplicity and control to an otherwise lucky Euro.

Carcassonne is easily one of the best games I have ever played! My gaming group took to it immediately! I look forward to adding expansions to my base game in the future.

A fun family and light gaming group-type game. I've played both the board game and iOS version several times, and they are good, especially with kids, but I don't think I'd go out of my way to play it. I'm sure I'll end up with a copy at some point, but I'm not in a rush.

RATING: 8
The game which brought me to boardgaming.  Pick a tile, place a tile, place a follower on the tile.  The quintessential gateway game which can be explained in two minutes, and a board game without a board, the first I had ever seen.

For me this is the gateway par excellence.  Pared down to two in its basic version it is quick and confrontational.  Throw in a couple of expansions and it becomes epic.  It can be whatever you want it to be.

I really enjoy this game from time to time. It's fast paced, surprisingly deep for the simplicity of it, and the final scores can be really close despite the amount of points and strategies employed. Still, I can't say this game is one that makes me want to play again and again. I'm sure purchasing an expansion or two would help with that, but for the time being, Carcassonne isn't a game that really wows me.

Classic.  Great game, from a game design perspective.  I'm not a big Euro game fan but can appreciate this.  I like my two player games to be tilted balance wise to not being too luck dependent (which I feel this game is), and the best course of action not being obvious (which it often is in this game).

I don't like the degree of luck involved in tile draws.  I've tried an alternate where you draw 3 tiles and choose 1 to place, putting the others back in the box, but that seems to result in cities being placed, then roads.  I do like farmer strategy, and meeple management balancing between an aggressive stance collecting points, early/late farmer placement, and keeping reserve meeples for the cloisters, etc.  I enjoy the game, but infrequently want to play it, and when I'm done with a game I never want to play it again.

A nice game.It has that puzzle touch that makes the difference.You must think how you'll use your people to gain more points but at the same time not to run out of them.After a number of plays it loses it's interest but it still remains a good filler game,because it's quick and easy going.At the end the final look of it on the table it's like a beautifull mosaic.

The game that made me enter into the world of board games: despite the very simple mechanics, the matches are always very satisfactory and, depending on the nature of the player, the type of game changes considerably with more or less interactions (and more or less fun). After so many games there is a need for expansions, personally playing with the first and second ones especially to "tap" the tile holes. And don't forget the pig!!

RATING: 8
This is a really nice tile-laying game. It can be played from 2 to 5 players and is very simple to teach. It also provides a satisfying visual element because you are building the game board together with the opponents.

It can get very chaotic with a higher number of players. I think 3 players is the ideal number for this game, just like in Samurai. Then it's not too chaotic, and not too calculated.

Also, it's worth mentioning there is much luck involved in the tile draws. If you don't get the tile you need it can cost you the game. But since it's a casual fun game I can forgive this.

RATING: 7
Another modern classic found in most decent board game collections. Simple tile laying game with minimum set-up. It seems a bit simple at first, but there's actually a good bit of strategy to be had in Carcasonne once it 'clicks'. It's all about the Where and When of where you place your Meeple (Farmers... or something). You're working collaboratively with the other players to build roads, cities, abbeys and farms. But you need to be the one to claim them at the right time. Too early and you might not finish them alone. Too late and another player could shut you out by claiming it first. I think the main negative for Klaus Wrede's Carcassone is the artwork. I read it once described as 'Dusty', and for some reason that word sticks. It's quite uninspiring. Where are the rolling plains? The sprawling metropolises? The awe-inspiring cathedrals? Nope. None of that. It's a long brown line leading up to a town that looks like the digestive that dropped in the bottom of your mug of tea. Sort it out, Klaus.

Playable game with 2 players but starts to shine when player count increases.  Good social game for all players, as tile placement allows for lots of kibitzing and hustling.  Some possibility of player vs. player, but frustration level tends to be low.

The classic tile-placement game.  Fantastic fun, and can get VERY strategic when playing against seasoned players who know tile distribution (which I like).  With all the expansions, gives this such a lot of re-playability, but even with just the base game, it's great.  Another example of a game where optimising what luck gives you (random tile draw) with experience (how to plan ahead to score big with farms, cities, etc) brings great gameplay.

This was my first euro (a gift from my girlfriend while we were vacationing in Portugal) and, although not my favorite game, it is the one we play when we have a chance.

I own the following expansions:
Inns & Cathedrals
Traders & Builders
Abbey & Mayor
The Princess & the Dragon

RATING: 7
Probably the game that really got me into the board gaming hobby. Carcassonne's turn structure is refreshingly simple - pick up a tile, place it, put a follower on it (if you want to), score any completed elements. I love the way that the landscape grows as the game progresses, and in a way this is what brings the game down for me. If I am to play the game to win, and strategize against my opponents, then the beautiful landscape will be tarnished by the unfillable holes that I create to hinder my opponents scoring. The expansions add a lot, and it’s great that you can pick and choose your rules, but unfortunately the game can run a bit long as you add more and more tiles.

Carcassonne is an excellent game to introduce to new players becuase it is primarily a visual game and has only a few rules.  It also has some interesting tactical decisions, and it looks great when spread out on the table.  It can handle a large number of people, and plays fairly quickly, which are also good.

Ultimately, though, I find the game uninspiring.  The strategy is offset in many cases by the other players affecting your plays.  Now I realize that this is an important part of the game, but at some point you have so little control that you cannot do any sort of planning.  Carcassonne is a good gateway game, but I wouldn't want to play it with any serious gamers.  There are many better games to play.

Average. At first I didn't like this game at all. My first play experience was so boring because it seemed to me so luck dependant. I decided to give this game a second chance. Now I consider it an good game because this "luck" factor only contributes to take you to a different game each time you play it. Also, it's an excellent family or two player game.

Overall comment: simple tile placing game with subtle strategic tactics, domino players may like this game, older players relate well to the play mechanic

Ratings:
Initial: 8 (nice thick pieces with simple but effective graphics)
Family: 7 (wife doesn't mind it, rest have little interest in it)
Game group: 6 (too simple with not enough tough decisions - not requested)
AP: 9 (little down time helps the pace of this game)
Solo play: 8 (#4 SoloPlay currently - plays quick and offers a different kind of challenge than the regular play)

When purchased: 2006
Expansions recommended: yes (need to cautiously review those available - traders/builders adds a different element which varies the game a bit)
Age range: 8+

Reason purchased: Geek analysis (wanted a gateway game for my wife)

Pros: plays quick and interesting to look act.  More fun if played light-heartedly
Cons: not much going on here and newer players have trouble understanding the farmers

Recommendations: Older players grasp the concept of this game quickly and enjoy the low strategy factors.  As far as a bridge game for my wife, it did not happen.  Others also struggled with the fun factor.
Replay rating: Below average
Game value (plays/cost): Marginal (solo play has helped a bit but it is rarely requested.

The basic activity of constructing the worlds easiest and least interesting freeform jigsaw puzzle is fundamentally fun. The game itself, winning points by plonking meeple, is disconnected and unengaging unless played with the kind of focussed competitivity that would discourage most members of the family groups you can imagine gathering around to play. There's a pleasure deficiency involved in this game that no amount of reskinning or expansion can cure.

Carcassonne could be called a modern classic.  It's relatively simple, quick to set up, very fun, easy to teach, and easy to play.  It's a game you might come back to over and over for years.  I don't think I'll ever really get sick of it.  It lacks some of the complexity and flair of something like Agricola or Castles of Burgundy, but this is a special game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I don't like giving Carcassonne just a Five. Building the board as you play, and placing your peeps on it feels cool. It is simple, easy to play, and really fun to watch the board expand into a beautifully confusing medieval landscape as you progress. I really do appreciate this game. BUT for me, its just not that exciting to play. I'm a competitive person and when I play, I find myself just placing tiles in a spot where they look the prettiest, not really focusing on winning. It's just not invigorating enough. Once you've placed one of your people on the board, you're kind of just waiting till you get the right pieces so that you can take them off and score points. The only part that can get exciting is the end of game farm warfare. Trying to steal your opponents farms can get pretty intense. It also feels good to magically find the perfect piece you've been waiting for all game. I wonder if the expansions add much spice to this game? Oh and I HATE the river tiles, they always ends up messing with the aesthetics of the board because it will leave holes where you couldn't find a piece with a river, road, and city in it. But the river tiles are a great tool for screwing over your opponent(s). I would be interested to see what rating this game would get if it were released today. All in all, I get a little bored playing this game, but it's still solid and I love that it exists.

(After 13 Plays) 10/12/16: Carcassonne is one of my favorite games. It has essentially no setup or teardown time at all, the game is very easy to understand, and there is enough strategy there to keep me entertained. Strangely, I cant get my friends into this one. I don't know if its the theme or what but they just don't seem to like it. To me, it is the perfect game to relax and play. Its not a brain burner or anything and its a game that allows table talk without interfering with the gameplay.

Got this game with high expectations to play with my entering-6th grade daughter.  I'd heard great things, and was hoping for an experience like "Lost Cities" with the possibility of more than two players.  But strangely it doesn't really do much for me, and it didn't do much for my daughter, either.  I guess if I'm going to be laying tiles, I either want it connected to an exploration theme or a puzzle theme, and Carcassonne doesn't scratch those itches for me.  Wouldn't hesitate to bring it out as a game for a non-gamer group, though "Ticket to Ride" would be my first choice.

Fairly innovative tile laying game where one reveals a tile, plays it on the table to connect to other tiles, then place a token on a road, farm, castle, or cloister to score points.

I like it because it's easy to get non-gamers to play and enjoy it.  The expansions tend to make the game longer, and if you add more than 2 or 3 of them, the game tends to get a bit insane and long.

Easy to teach to anyone. Vanilla (just roads and cities ) is great for the family, and those times when you don't want to stress too much. The difficulty ramps up with expansions and field rules etc. for players that want a little more. Always up for a game of Carc.

RATING: 6.5
Modern classic that is easy to teach/learn and offers a nice level of strategy for a gateway type game. Scales well with more players as the time is about the same. Rule variant where you play then draw (so you have tile during other players turns) further reduces game time.

[b]Carcassonne[/b] - base game

A bit light for my taste, more of a family game, but haven't tried any of its numerous expansions and perhaps haven't played with the bloodthirsty crowd that I prefer. Basic version is a good introductory to board games for kids.

I've forgotten - I've actually played this one online at Brettspielwelt.de  WITH  some of the expansions (Traders&Builders, Cathedrals, Princess&Dragon) and it was much much better than the basic game. Quite good for 2, 3, even 4 players. Keep in mind that with each additional player the game will slow down a bit.

Earns a higher rating provided you play with one of the above expansions.

Updated Sep 20, 2014:
Has been fantastically successful with kids age 4&up, despite their love for video games. They love Carcassonne's tile building aspect, and the dragon from the Princess&Dragon expansion is a very exciting addition. You can water down the rules for them and introduce the more difficult nuances later on.

This is a game that's easy to just sit down and start playing.  People who've never played any sort of game before will be able to lay tiles so they match, and pretty soon everyone will work out what's going on and start having fun.  Each expansion seems small enough to learn on the fly, adding just enough complexity to keep the game fresh.

This is a neat little game that is easy to learn. However, I found the continuous process of drawing a random tile and placing it down quite boring.

RATING: 5.5
Scoring can be a bit difficult for beginners and its random nature of tile drawing puts me off a bit. That said, I would play this if someone asked, but I do wish the theme was cooler and maybe if gameplay gave you more control. Then again, most good gateway games need healthy doses of luck to equalize the playing field a bit, so I don't mind too much...its just not a game I would crave to replay much.

The famous game that I really never cared for. I played only 2-3 times with some expansions (river expansions and something else that I don't remember). I thought I would play if I buy the game. So I bought it. I never opened it. I found Die Burg and I liked Die Burg. I only played Die burg. I sold the game unopened. Now I love Die Burg and think about this original Carcassonne. Do I want to play? Not really. 

It is so interesting to find out that these two games (Carcassone and Carcassone - Die Burg) are a lot more different than I thought.

Carcassonne - flip a tile. Find where it is playable. Later flip a tile and hope it is the one that matches the other tile that benefit you.

Die Burg - flip a tile. Now it can be played almost anywhere. Wow. So many decisions. Decisions Decisions....

Genial para iniciarse en los juegos de mesa. Muy bueno con 2-3 jugadores. Recomiendo probar la variante no oficial en la que cada jugador empieza con 3 losetas ocultas al resto de jugadores. En tu turno sacas una cuarta y escoges la que colocas entre las que cuatro que tienes, manteniendo boca abajo las otras tres. No recomiendo jugarlo a 6, demasiado caótico.

RATING: 7
Like Settlers of Catan, Carcassonne is a good "gateway" game that has very broad appeal, and unlike Settlers, the price is right ;-)  It's good to have a copy of this in your collection to play with non-gamers, but it's no longer one that I pull off the shelf for my own enjoyment (and I feel the same way about SoC).  For absolute beginners, "Metro" is a better tile-laying game than Carcassonne due to its simple and elegant ruleset.

RATING: 7
Note: I play with 3rd ed/HiG rules, not the 1st ed/RGG rules that came with the Big Box. 

Carsossonne is a tile-laying game, allowing you to build roads, cities, or fields, all interconnected. You only scores points by claiming a tile when you play it, using a limited supply of "meeples."

In my experience, Carcassonne is very dependent on who you are playing with. Playing a tile that makes a city or road difficult for your opponents to complete is one thing but this game can turn aggressive with some players. There is aggressive yet still fun, and then aggressive and ugly. 

However, it is by nature a variable game, different each time. And with the right crowd, is lots of fun. 

This game also travels well. Throw the tiles and figures in a couple Zip-lock bags and (with paper/pen to keep score) you are good to go.

Uno de los euro-juegos más clásicos y el primero que tuve en mi colección.
Su simplicidad es francamente genial, se trata de una especie de una especie de híbrido entre un rompecabezas y un dominó moderno: se amontonan al principio del juego, y al azar, todas las piezas con las que se juega, cuadrados de cartón que contienen dibujos de pequeños trozos de un paisaje compuesto de dos o más de los cuatro elementos que conforman el juego (segmentos de ciudades, segmentos de caminos, segmentos de campos o conventos). 
Se coloca una pieza inicial en la mesa y luego, turno tras turno, cada jugador roba una pieza adicional, al azar, del montón y la coloca en la mesa de tal manera que empalme perfectamente con todas las piezas con las que colinde (segmentos de ciudad deben empalmar con segmentos de ciudad, segmentos de camino con segmentos de camino y segmentos de campo con segmento de campo) hasta que las piezas del montón se terminen.
Cuando un jugador coloca una pieza, tiene la posibilidad de colocar a uno de sus seguidores (fichas de madera, cada jugador empieza con 7) sobre alguno de los elementos presentes en ella (camino, ciudad, campo o convento), bajo ciertas reglas, y así reclamar el elemento como propio.
Las reglas definen los mecanismos para definir como se finaliza la construcción de cada elemento y como se obtienen puntos cuando eso suceda y lo más interesante, como lograr que los jugadores invadan territorios de sus oponentes y tomen posesión de ellos.
Es un juego muy divertido, dinámico y fácil de aprender, ideal para jugar con personas no habituadas a euro-juegos o para personas que quieran empezar en este mundo.

I have only played this game with 4 or more players that tend to suffer from AP so I think my experience with this game has been less then its potential

The other issue I have is there really isn't a way to do any long term planning as the board can change so much between turns and you have no idea what tile you are going to draw next.

I love how the board looks at the end of the game but I don't feel super challenged while building it.

Good game, especially with use of some of the expansions (Inns & Cath. the best, I think).  I find that it drags a bit with more than about three players.

When I first saw this game, I instantly knew I was going to like it. Haven't met anyone that doesnt like it yet. Sceptics, yes. But they where quickly turned over.
Very simple game, draw a tile and add it to the ever growing "puzzle" of cities, roads, cloisters, and farms. When one of above mentioned features that is controlled by your followers are completed, you score points.

House rule: Each player starts with two tiles and draws a new one each turn, adding some tactic to the game.

I have a huge set containing 2 Carcassones, Inns & Cathedrals, 2 Traders & Builders, King & Scout, River I & II and the Mini Expansion. Can't actually fit it on a table any more :)
I still feel sad when I realize that a game is about to run out of tiles... :(

Fun little tile-laying game. Some of the variants add a little strategy to the mix, and this is a great game for introducing new players to designer board games. While I think it is an essential, I would have liked to have seen a bit more strategy to balance the huge luck determinant to the game.

I like that Carcassonne can be explained to a new player in about 10 minutes.  Even for folks who aren't into tabletop games you can talk them through the mechanics of play and how to score points very quickly.  This makes finding players a breeze, and Carcassonne is now on the short list of games I will bring to family get togethers for dessert and coffee gaming.

Dominoes with a point salad scoring system. If you're new to board games, take your time. But if you think any version of Carcassonne is better than Isle, you've just been left behind.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Player interaction is so limited that Carcassonne feels almost like a solitaire game. The interaction that does exist is almost entirely with the intention of screwing your opponents over and yet the game remains very relaxing: Draw a tile, play that tile, and maybe put a meeple on it somewhere. A deep, off-topic conversation would disrupt the flow of most other games, Carcassonne is the exact opposite: You can have a deep conversation, forgetting you are playing the game, and when your turn arrives it won't even interrupt your train of thought.

The appeal of the game is actually in watching the layout of the Carcassonne countryside gradually unfold. 

In both gameplay and atmosphere, Carcassonne is this generation's Dominoes.

A tile-laying game where everyone is building a large landscape.  As you lay your tiles there becomes opportunities to place your meeples to score you points.

Everyone loves this game.  I do not see the genius in it.  It is ok, but half way through the game I tend to wonder when the hell will it be over?  Forget about adding all the expansions for me as well, just makes the game soo much longer.

Carcassonne, just the base game, I rate a 7.  I've been finding it rather tedious with no expansions, but with Inns/Cathedrals/Traders/Builders, the game has leaps to a 9.  It just adds so many more opportunities, so much more to think about it, that I can see myself playing this for years to come.

I love the tile placing mechanic, however this game doesn't excite me very much. I really do enjoy it as a light game with friends, but it never really grabs me. If someone offers, I will play more than half the time but I prefer most of my other games more. Considering trying an expansion to see if that would make for a more interesting experience. 

Edit: Think I like it a little more than I did when I wrote this. Maybe underplayed, but I find it drier than most games I own and I like a little theme so that my imagination can get going. Still considering expansions...

Let's face it: Carc is a LOT more cutthroat than most people would like to admit.  Possibly with a passive-aggressive edge to it, but still, the daggers come out.

My willingness to play this has faded over the years but it doesn't take away the fact that this is a good game. After all Carcassonne was the spark that got me heavy into gaming. A staple in my collection.

Figuring out how to play your tiles and meeples can be a good study in logic. You need to be able to sneak into opponents areas and grab control.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Reference tile laying game every other similar game will compare to.

One of the gateway games of choice, thanks to its simplicity and elegance.

I don't rate it higher because of its lack of depth. You draw one piece and you have to place it, and whether you'll accompany it with a meeple or not. That's the only decisions you'll take (the first one usually is quite evident, the second one not so much).

I increase my 2012-09 7.0 rating to 7.5 -> Not a lot of games are still that compelling after that long.

RATING: 9
Another classic gateway game.  I will play this with anyone, anytime.  Some people complain that the endgame scoring is confusing, but I've never had a problem.  Maybe I'm doing it wrong?  Whatever, It's a brilliant game and a must-own in every gamer's collection.

8 rating is with the INNS AND CATHEDRALS expansion and the TRADERS AND BUILDERS EXPANSION.  Good gateway game.  Farmer scoring is a bit weird, but makes sense to me.  Recommend, but realize that it will slowly fall off in enjoyment, the more plays that it gets.

With each play of this game my love of it has decreased. The random element has something to do with it. But mostly I am not a fan of the game play: I feel like I am in a straightjacket, with so many actions and once they are spoken for, well I can twiddle my thumbs or throw myself against the padded walls. To me this is one of the most over-rated, over-hyped games that I have come across. It just feels like there is no "there" there.

Relatively lightweight but still midly satisfying game. It's got much of what it takes for its popularity - very easy to learn, smooth, appealing to the eye, rather short and thus good for several plays in a row -, but the style of play is pretty obvious since the first couple of turns, and with every move affected by the luck of the draw there's not much room for long-term strategy. As a result the game is fun but it leaves only a faint aftertaste.

Bellissimo x la sua semplicità... Da giocare e rigiocare... le prime 2 espansioni completano il gioco, le altre non sono del tutto necessarie. Il gioco apprezzato soprattutto da chi predilige giochi semplici e non troppo lunghi anche se, con le varie espansioni se non si escludono un po' di pezzi, rischia di essere lunghissimo. All'interno della versione base c'è l'espansione 'The River' che considero inutile se non addirittura fastidiosa. Ormai comincio le partite escludendola.

Still a classic. Best played in a pub with a crowd of bemused but intrigued onlookers or on a pool table by merging a couple of dozen boxes together. Lacks depth after a while, but an expansion or two will perk that up, no problem. We prefer this with three - the heads-up waiting game for downing one's farmers palls very quickly, and a third player adds just a little screwage to the to-ing and fro-ing of the two-player game.

Farms make it a bit of work to know who's winning until the game is over, so it doesn't feel very competitive (especially to the young). Scoring fully for incomplete roads and cloisters seems wrong to me.

It's a good game; definitely good for its pick-up-and-play nature, and I have stumbled home from pubs and clubs and played this game with people have never played it before and they pick it up within 10mins. 

It's enjoyable and satisfying, but I feel lacking in long-term strategical depth. In terms of excitement it doesn't get you really engaged and 'battling' your opponents, or on the edge of your seat to see what card you are dealt next like some games do.

Having said all of that, it's a really good game and concept. I haven't played the expansions but I imagine they add to it.

If majority of players like a game at first play this means this game is a quality game. I see top 100 list is full of games which cannot effect new players but Carcassone is different. It deserves every decimal of its score. This game is underrated here. It deserves 8. Not 7. This game is a sample of quality design. Short time game, fun to play with 2-3-4 even 5 players. Easy to learn a bit hard to master. Lots of options at board, a good ai and application. However app is a bit expensive. Anyway this game deserves 8.

Elegant ruleset. Two-player Carcassonne is a vicious test of tactics and strategy, while multiplayer Carcassonne is a slightly more chaotic but still cutthroat social experience.

Wonderful game. Rules are clear, easy and appealing. The game is simple but with a lot of strategy and tension for the big-central-field control.
I dislike the rules changes for the small cities and the farmers' scoring :-(
I also dislike the abuse of expansions to this neat game.

Easy to learn and play. Not too deep as far as strategy but very enjoyable light game.
Update 4/5/2012. Well when you add the other expansions like traders and builder and abby...it does get more challenging but adds more time. But after you get enough of the original it's well worth the expansion to add them even though it's longer.

A couple of years ago, my comment on Carcassonne was as follows:

"Bores me quickly. It's a little bit too easy, and quite often it's lacking tension; but overall it's fine and good to play with children. I think I may need to play it with some of the expansions, otherwise there's plenty of other games I'd prefer instead."

In late 2017, Carcassonne is a game I love to play as a filler with 3-6 players (not with just 2 players, still.) Also, it's one of the games that works really well for the whole family. Even my dad may join on occasions.

[i]Great game I originally bought to play with my wife.
She loved it but what surprised me was how much my kids enjoy it as well. This is a great family game, and what is most surprising is that my wife is probably the most cutthroat player closely followed by my son. This game has a very easy to learn rule set but there is a surprising amount of depth for a tile laying game. This really is the game that every family should have.

This is a game we have played with a lot of people who don't typically play or enjoy games. My in-laws played it one night at our house and they bought it the next day![/i]

This was my gateway game into Euro-style board-gaming. I have always been a gamer, and I had played RoboRally many times, but this is game that started me down the road towards searching for more and varied board game experiences. Something this game has taught me is to be frugal with adding to many expansions to a game (Race for the Galaxy excepted I guess). I have have found that while expansions can spice things up a bit, adding too many additional rules can sometime obscure the core game experience. This is especially true when one of the key appeals of the games is the accessibility.

A year ago I gave Carcassonne: Hunters and Gatherers, a mediocre rating, and was not particularly eager to play again.  This, the original game, made a much better first impression on me.  Although I am not very good at games involving acquiring territory in general, this one made more sense to me than the Hunters and Gatherers expansion.  It's not a cooperative game, but it does have some cooperative aspects to it, which I like.  The object of the game is to win, but the competition is more benign, which for me translates to a less stressful, more fun gaming experience.  The components are of very good quality and the artwork is really attractive. (4+4)

Like "Ticket to Ride," another gateway game, I found "Carcassonne" to be only mildly interesting, and too dry on the whole to continue playing. I also found the 'farmer' rule to be too fiddly and therefore detracted from my enjoyment. 

At the time I had it, my 13-year-old stepson took some interest in playing it, but not overwhelmingly so. On the whole it's okay to play and the board looks beautiful when a game's done. 

I'll also say that when I'm traveling and see people playing this, I feel happy that games like this are becoming better known and enjoyed. 

Like many others, I agree that the farmer rules are very fiddly and easy to simply ignore.

I've just over thrown my initial comment about this game. The more I play, the more it grows on me. I always have fun playing this.

Verdict:
Both strategic and tactic. Very good for 2~3 players. I can just have fun and relaxed playing peacefully or go cut-throat and nasty playing competitively; depending on the mood. 
4~5er game can only be seen as a fun & relaxed filler since luck of draw kicks in too heavily.

A good exercise to improve one's observation skill.

50+ plays. Very elegant in its simplicity. Pick up a tile, play a tile, score if you've completed an element you started earlier, place a meeple on one of the elements you've just placed to potentially score later. The key to its success is the claim now, score later feature - in most tile-laying games you score with the playing of the tile itself. Combine that with offering people different elements to claim on each tile to offer choice, and fast turns to boot, and the game has broad appeal. While it doesn't come out as often as it used to, it's still a quality game I enjoy. This base game is moving closer to filler territory now that everyone can play fast.

- Tile draws are frustratingly random

This is a classic game, and it's a reasonable gateway game with good replayability...if you enjoy it to begin with. My wife found it quite dull, but also hated "stealing" farms. I find it either dull (if you play casually), or brain-burny and cutthroat (if you play seriously).

Rating lowered from 5 to 4 after my 3rd play.

A classic! In the meantime I got about every expansion there is (except The River I), if you combine all of them it gets about the messiest game there is. The Inns and Cathedrals stayed with the basic game ever since, never take it out. Traders and builders is the best expansion in my opinion and stays as well, the only problem is if you play with both the tower and the princess & dragon expansions... WHAT A MESS!! Never play with both simultaneously. We keep all the pieces though we just ignore the special tiles from the expansion we don't wanna play with, I just can't help myself, it looks great when all the tiles are on the table...

RATING: 7
Players: 2-5 (Best with 2 or 3) I think Carcassonne is better without expansions. Normal Carcassonne is a good light and short game. Expansions increases the luck factor, game difficulty for newbies, the game is longer and there is not a huge increase on strategy. The only expansion i think is useful is "The count" went you play with a lot of people in the same game. I have played all the expansions i own more than one time but i only note the first one on every expansions (if every time i play Carcassonne i have to note all expansions...)

I particularly love this game for two players - very strategic. Particularly when preventing your opponent from scoring points is just as good as scoring points yourself, there are so many possible things you could do with each tile, and you have to decide which to prioritize.

Working with more players is just gravy.

RATING: 8.9
As Peter O’Toole said for cricket in “What’s new Pussycat”:
 "It doesn't involve anxieties or pressures. It's leisurely and lyrical. It's the song of willow on leather."

I bought it in order to play with my family and my wife as a couple.

My mother (can't manage complicated games) loved it. (actually the farm rule really messed with her mind, I am thinking of not using farmers when playing with her)
My brother (more of a gamer, but get's easily bored) doesn't care for it but will play it if I ask him. I personally love it, but it doesn't seem to go very well with everyone else. I guess it feels a bit dated to them.

I think playing with three players makes the game a lot more interesting.

I can explain the rules to anyone within five minutes.

Love to see the town forming from zero. 
Love the wooden followers. 
Eager to use all the expansions but i don't want to spoil the exhitment too early!

Conserning the gameplay maybe the farms are a bit more powerful than they should have.

I keep tidy in the main box in very classy homemade tuck boxes the following expansions:
Inns & Cathedrals
Traders & Builders
The Princess & the Dragon 
The Tower
Abbey & Mayor 
Count, King & Robber 
The Phantom 
Hills & Sheep 

(Wife's Point of View: Me and my wife spend a lot of our time indoors and I bought it mainly for playing with her. To my surprise she doesnt' like it at all. Major disappontment. I thought that Carcassonne will be a hit because it's the opposite of frustrating. I think she finds it really boring.

...I still remember the cashier when I bought the game. He asked me why I was buying it and when I told him that I want it as a 2-player for me and my wife he went. "Oh it's perfect for that". Who could have guessed)

12/17/10 - I've read plenty of reviews claiming that this game is wife compatible so I had to see if my wife would enjoy the game. I borrowed my friends copy which was the big box 2 but we only played the original game tiles. She loved the game and we had to play a second match immediately after the first game. She likes it! :)

1/19/11 - I showed my wife I could download this game directly to my Xbox. Her quote "Buy it!". After a short wait for the download we proceeded to play two quick games. She likes it on the Xbox "Because we don't have to clean up all the tiles". I for-see this game being played quite a few more times. I rated it an 8 because it gets my non-gaming wife to play.

Later Edit: Actually, the game without addons seems to involve a lot of luck. If you got the monasteries ... you almost won the game.

Although I haven’t logged many games of this on BGG I think it is actually my most played game, probably close to 100 plays. Most of these plays were with the Inns and Cathedrals expansion, which I think is essential and should have come in the base game. My sheer number of plays reflects the greatness of this game (and the short play time), and it was really interesting to see the change in play style as we it more and more. It went from the two of us almost ignoring each other and trying to score as efficiently as possible with the tiles we drew to screwing each other over at every opportunity! To the point where drawing a cathedral tile would be more useful as way to scupper your opponents plans than it would be to score extra points on your own cities. The farms also become super competitive so finding creative ways to engineer a way to sneak just one more meeple into a big juicy farm became a staple part of the game.

My overall rating of this has only dropped due to the sheer amount of plays I’ve had and that I am gravitating towards more complex games these days. I would still play this two player, if ever given the chance.

Nice, relaxing, fun game. Of course we quickly became cutthroat with it by trying to steal and ruin other people's cities.

We include the tiles for the first three expansions, but typically play base rules except for cathedrals. Reading the full rule books for those expansions gives me the impression that they add needless complexity.

2-3: Ideal

One of my favorite filler and gateway games.  Easy to teach and there are easy objectives for new players.  With experienced players the field points can get nasty, but that's not a bad thing.  I have only played this one once without the river expansion.  I would suggest always playing with it.  This game is great when you have three players.  Four works as well and since the game is limited by the number of tiles, it doesn't really increase the game length.  Five is okay, but I would suggest getting additional expansion tiles to give everyone more plays if you're going to do five.

I like the game for its simplicity. Rules are easy to master and game play wise is a heck loads of fun. Some people may find this boring but I had a good time playing and teaching this game. I like tile laying games for they allow me to build the game map from scratch and it is always interesting to me to see something different each time I play the game. The river expansion provides an interesting starting variation to the basic game. 

I'll give this a 10 as I've been playing heaps of it and with the expansions, it always seem to make the game more than it already is. Great gateway for beginners.

I love Carcassone. My first Eurogame. Sigh.  Still a great game with 2 or 3 players.  The original is very good. The expansions don't add that much for me.

I designed a variant using the base game and bits from Traders & Builders and Inns & Cathedrals.  I think its brilliant.

Update, 2014. I've been playing in the evenings with my wife (the base game alone), and remembering what a fine little game it is, if, like me, you appreciate simplicity in games.  BTW, Carcassonne can be vicious with just 2p. I'm uprating to 8.

Very fun tile-laying game. Was my first ever tile-laying game, and I still enjoy playing it whenever I can. Can get cutthroat with 2 players if you both know how to play well.

It's a great gateway game and comes as a high recommendation from me. Should be in every gamers collection.

Not really sure why this game has become iconic of eurogames, as the luck factor really dominates the game.  The tile laying is fun, but often frustrating because you can't get the tile you need.  It's impossible to plan in this game, and the farmer scoring is too unintuitive.

RATING: 8
This game is the classic medium weighter, with a good playing time (less than 1 hour) and enjoyable by a range of types. Probably my most played game, as it is very easy for new people to pick up and tactically interesting enough for most experienced gamers to enjoy as well. The gameplay mechanic is clever and simple, with players facing a wide range of choices but requiring little forward planning. While some people may see the simplicity as a drawback, I find it makes Carcassonne the perfect game for anything from a relaxed afternoon with non-gamers to an intense evening of geeky games.

Pound for pound one of my favorite games. I have played it extensively with ages 6-80. With slightly simplified rules (no farmers) I have played hours and hours with my 7-year old, have introduced it to adults who have enjoyed it as well. Bring it out when I have small groups, or non-gamer friends mostly. Have played it solitare and tried to beat my previous score (written on back of box).

Two concurrent paths to victory: brain-burning calculations toward winning the battle of farmers, while also staring at the ceiling hoping to draw a killer tile. If I'm in the mood for a brain burner, I'd prefer a different game. If I'm in the mood for a light luckfest, I'd prefer a different game.

One of the best gateway games out there. The base game is pretty simple, easy to learn rules and excellent to introduce to non-gamers, as well. However, it's not simplistic, as it offers a great depth; Carcassonne is pretty much a concealed wargame, wrapped around a eurogame box with high-quality wooden components. The numerous expansions add various flavors and let you customize your game: do you want a peaceful game, a random fun game with the catapult, or a wargame with dragon? I definitely recommend it.

A gateway game.  I find that with just the base game, the farmers can be a little overpowered but I'm sure the expansions will help with that problem.

My appreciation for this game has gone up and down, very first times to try this game did not spark the interest too much (and it was well before playing Settlers of Catan - the game that really got me hooked). After getting more into board gaming I started to play Carcassonne again and few first times were good. Then again it felt boring after 10 or so plays, especially as some of the games were with 5 players (not recommended at all). Then I discovered how competitevly this can be played and especially with 2 players. And now I think it is a very good game for 2-3 players with really great replay value - every game evolves differently. Traders & Builders Expansion also sparked new life into this game and is now the preferred way to play the game for me (base Carcassonne + T&B)

Gra ma dużo interakcji, także tej negatywnej. Dosyć szybka rozgrywka, najlepsze w 3 osoby. W 2 to za mało, w 4 za długo się czeka na swój ruch i wpływ działań innych na naszą potencjalną strategię jest zbyt duży.

This game finds the middle ground between those aimed at casual game players and the more serious gamers.

I am still impressed with Carcassonne after 50 games played. 

No dice. Quick set-up. Simple rules. The gameboard expands and gets more beautiful as you play the game. There is just enough meat to the scoring mechanisms to offer plenty of strategy that keeps me coming back to try something different.

This is a classic that adults and kids can both enjoy together.

Basic Carcassonne, who wouldn't know that one. The gama is nice, there is no closed information and opponents can give tips (or manipulation) on placing the tiles. I bet the expansions will increase tactical choices (I'm not familiar with the expansions).

My friend Scott's favorite (at least was for long enough to get to 20 plays).

I like it as a 2 player with just the base game.  Farmers play a bigger role that way (since the river breaks it up too much).  Farmers can also be placed on almost every tile in the game.  This gives a player more chances to earn the win rather than be the lucky one that drew more of the tiles he needed.

I owned Carcassonne several years ago. It was played a bit, but I never got into it. I lost the game while I was in the Army and I really did not have the desire to replace it. 

Recently I have been gaming quite a bit more though and one of the things that we have been looking for are good language independent games. We picked up the Carcassonne Big box because it just seemed like a good fit.

I have not been dissapointed. The game fits the bill for what we need. It has been enjoyable and I am looking forward to trying out some of the expansions.

Update: Added a few of the expansions in last night and suprisingly enjoyed the result. This game is getting played a lot due to the language independence and the ease of setup. I am glad I am trying this again.

It looks a little dry when sitting on the shelf next to other newer games but when I get it out, I remember how much I enjoyed it.  It stands up just fine.  Carcassonne is timeless and a great game with simplistic beauty.

The game that made me a born again board gamer. It used to be a staple of games night and for awhile no Saturday morning was complete until the roomies and I had played a game of Carc. It's lost a lot of the original lustre but I still enjoy a game from time to time.

Update:  This will always be a good game to introduce to new gamers, but I don't seem to reach for it too often otherwise.

Update:  We did finally play the uber-game with all the expansions at once, it was huge and took over 2 hours!

This was our first real 'Geek Game' that I found via BGG.  There's a very good reason that it's so highly considered.  This is just a terrific classic that is accessible yet always challenging.  There are too many permutations to get jaded with it.  We liked the base game so much, that after one week with it, we ordered the "Big Box II" so that we could have all the best expansions and we passed the base game along to my in-laws.  We've never played all the expansions at once, and yet, it's fun to try to pick ones that will work well together.  This is one we will keep coming back to time and time again.

(01/08) It is a classic for a reason. It continues to engage with people I play it with. It usually gets to be played more than once in one sitting, even without any expansions games tend to vary a lot from game to game. It can accomodate experienced players and new players.

It is as simple as pick a tile, place a tile and decide if you want to put a meeple on it to try and get points according to the tile you placed it into, yet it can generate really interesting interactions and risky moves that can almost become a meta-narrative on the game. (A player built a castle that just keep on growing, will he be able to close it before the game ends?)

Quick, fun, simple. It has influenced other games to use this mecanism as part of a bigger machine (Isle of Skye, for example)

Settlers of Catan was my first Eurogame back in 1995 and I loved it, but getting a copy of Carcassonne after visiting the place in 2002 was what really hooked me on these things....so this is all your fault, Carcassonne! 

22Jan13: I'm still very fond of Carcassonne, but recently played the vanilla version with no expansions for the first time in years, and it definitely seemed less interesting. So rating for the base game is downgraded for the first time from 8 to 7, but remains at 8 when a couple of expansions are added (especially Inns & Cathedrals and a river).

RATING: 8.2
I Love this game, and find it soooo addictive.  Within 2 days of playing it for the first time, I had ordered the expansion sets.  Now, I've even gotten the unofficial expansions, like "the plague".  It is the most fun with only 2-3 players and I still enjoy the original base game the most.

This is a great family game.  Place tiles to match other tiles like building a big puzzle and put meeples (little wooden people) on them to score points.  Always a winner if you don't spring too many expansions on new players.

As a family game, I can recommend the Inns & Cathedrals Expansion, and the Traders & Builders Expansion.  They are totally worth it.  I wouldn't bother with any of the other 10 expansions unless you're a game geek playing with game geeks - or your family really plays this game A LOT.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5

Great game. Not too complicated, easy to understand and the rules are very easy to explain to other players, even to those who are new to board games. All this makes the game perfect family game, allowing people to play it and chat the same time. 

Ideal for those who does not appreciate brain consuming games played in total or almost total silence. Wide (not to say enormous) amount of extensions gives variety of play where you can control the impact of the randomness of the game (from medium to large).
The amount of extensions and randomness makes it very re-playable for such a easy game.

Beautiful game with a very simple set of rules and still very challenging. It's original form has a few flaws and there are certainly a few pieces missing. Expansions have corrected this, but I give this game a 9 because of that.

Hours and hours of fun is guaranteed! Works really well for any number of players between 2 and 5! Number of games played is impossible to count.

A game that feels like a classic the first time you play.

Pros:
* Easy to teach and easy to learn.
* No two games are ever the same.

Cons:
* Some people want to play this game so much you get burnt out on it.
* Game should have come with a bag for tile selection.
* Default rules should be either 1 or 3 tiles in hand when starting.

***Carcassonne Big Box 3***

All Carcassonne plays (including expansions or not) are logged under base set.

Light and enjoyable game. A game that my dad can play and that says a lot.

---- Update ----
With more choices to bring to the table, I hardly feel the urge to play Carcassonne.

---- Update ----
Due to large box size and I am now scrambling for space on my shelf for my games, I am not surprised at all that this one was the first to go. Sure I could discard the box and put all the tiles and meeples in a customized container but I just don't feel the need to play this game anymore.

We play this a LOT. It's a near perfect level of strategy for winding down after work. We play it with the river expansion which greatly accelerates the initial part of the game which can be slow when you start from a single tile as in the base-set. The river expansion should just be considered an essential part of the base game as it perfectly solves the one downfall of the base set which is the slow start.

But the river is the only expansion we use. I've found some of them fun - but some, like the Tower, radically alter the nature of the game (turns it into a mean-spirited "gotcha" game) Trying to stuff too much into a beautifully crafted smooth-as-silk-playing light strategy game sort of defeats the point. Carcassone, Patchwork, Morels, Tramhahn, Splendor, these are so perfect in balance and weight and fun. I can't see trying to bulk-up Carcassone into a midweight game. It isn't - and that's part of its charm. It's a near perfect lightweight strategy 2p game.

Carcassonne is an okay game. In my mind, it works best as a gateway game, but it seems a little lacking for seasoned gamers. However, I have never played with any of then expansions.

Hated the game at first. I heard such huge things about the game. After 2 plays we realized the game is about having fun.

Uno de los más clásicos de los clásicos Eurogames. Mientras construimos un puzzle tenemos que realizar nuestra mejor gestión de nuestros....¡¡PEONES DE MADERA!! Eso sí, de diferentes y vivos colores. Hay quien detesta que se les llame peones o fichas de madera y han optado por la denominación inglesa, creo, de MEEPLES. Yo como siempre hubiera deseado que fueran Miniaturas (o Miniatures) que representaran fielmente lo que son (granjeros, ladrones, constructores, etc). Un gran juego a pesar de los tochos de madera.

RATING: 6
I'm a bit shocked this is rated so highly, and how in love with it some of my friends are.  Still...I find it a pretty enjoyable game, though I'm a bit worn on it now.  It's difficult to overcome an early, powerful farmer.  What troubles me about this one is that I know HOW to overcome such a farmer, but the difficulty is immense, and I always lose out to someone who's been lucky.  But when you CAN overcome it, victory is satisfying. I won't play this with more than 3 and I don't like the river any more.  Players can also take a little too long to place a piece.  For me, the game is too light for it to be enjoyable with more than 10 seconds of AP.

I feel like I'm one of the only people in the world who doesn't like this game. I admit, I'm not a huge fan of this style of euro - but I'd prefer Settlers of Catan to this. Some people say it plays well with two, my partner and I thought it was way to easy with two. Feels dramatically flat - no tension, excitement or huge sense of accomplishment when you win. I imagine would be better and more interesting with more players, if you like this style of euro game.

This is a fine multiplayer game that is also nice as a family game. I also like the first few add-ons. Nice thing is that this comes from time when direct competitive interaction was still used by designers. I can steal your points, not just playing on a parallel track trying to make more points you or the others. I must say the system started to be milked to much. At some point the add-on hysteria started to become ridiculous.

What else can you say about Carcassonne? One of the most simple boardgames out there. It's like a collective jigsaw puzzle activity but with the crucial addition that each player claims parts of the puzzle being constructed. 

So you get both the sense that your are building this great map with everyone else at the table while also strategically placing the tiles and meeples to get the maximum benefit for yourself and, if possible, mess with other players too.

Quick, addictive - and great!

Countless words have been said on this game, but I'll add some of my own.  First, my rating represents my desire to play, but this game is a must-play-once kind of game. I bought it, played it with my girlfriend's sister, whose husband then bought a copy, who now plays with another group guys, etc.  The reason?  Its a great game.  My only hangup revolves around the 'farmers' - too many people get confused on how they score up.


When do I play this?:
This one is for the noobs.  For fun, see how they pronounce the game. Hah!

Very fun game. Wish that the scoring mechanism wasn't so complicated :-(

RATING: 8
Played once and enjoyed it. I like the way the map develops, and interesting strategy around use of the farmer. Seems there is maybe too much reliance on the luck of the draw. Have read on this site that Hunters & Gatherers takes it to a higher level and would like to try that.

RATING: 9
Another game that is simple to learn but has untold levels of strategy and possibilities. My 10-year-old can't get enough of this game and doesn't get tired of it when a game takes two hours (which only happens with multiple expansions).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The random tile draw makes long term planning difficult.  When the game is slow, the fun drains out of it.  So playing with players who suffer from AP even on this game is harsh.  Even so, if everyone draws a new tile as soon as they play their tile and spend less than 30 seconds to play, it is a lot of fun.  It is especially good as a gateway game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very good game, but it does eventually get old, even with expansions.  Excellent for what it is and I recommend it for every collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Finally got around to getting/playing this game and I can only say that it is absolutely wonderful. Watching the countryside take shape and adjusting strategy and approach as it does is mesmerizing for me, like a fluid jigsaw puzzle where the outcome is created as you go. Only have the base game as of yet, but I can see where I'll want to add expansions quite soon. Easy to learn, but with many different approaches available for strategy, and the right sprinkling of luck of the draw, this is a keeper for me and my family. Truly deserves to be called a classic.

Update: after over 40 plays and the addition of Inns and Cathedrals, this has become one a favorite. We always play with the expansion now and it managed to make a great game better. My daughter and I play this whenever we get the opportunity now and I simply can't get enough. Great game.

Another family favorite.  The tile building concept is very different, and makes a cool looking map at the end.  All the possibilities with each tile of who to play is great fun, and using your meeples correctly can be a challenge (i.e. the farmer).  Usually more experienced players dominate due to proper use of meeples, but the whole expereience is always a joy.

RATING: 7
A little too abstract and luck driven for me, but nevertheless a very solid game that is usually fun to play. I prefer games where every turn requires a critical decision – I rarely feel tension during my turns which is probably contributed to the fact that luck of the draw limits planning.  Even with The River expansion, I still find it a problem that a successful (or unsuccessful) gamble on farms in the first few turns sometimes determines the outcome of the game.

RATING: 5
Personally, I find this game shares the same syndrome as Lost Cities in that the game play is enjoyable, but determining player status requires maths gymnastics and the climax of scoring is an overlong, dull chore.  My other experience niggles are that: A) the pace of the game tends to become inverse (from quick to slow) as the options to place a tile increases (a limiting border as in TaYu/Entdecker would help), neither does playing with more than two players or the original rule of picking a tile at the start of your turn speed up pace. B) to help in making an informed decision you have to speculate on the remaining distribution of tile types and configurations which isn't uniform and so difficult to commit to memory.But these objections contradict the popular experience of the game. What's the universal appeal? I guess it is the several mini scoring advancements and the satisfaction of completing a desired castle, road etc to get a scoring opportunity back. The other elements could be the creative expression and continually different designs the plays make. Could the greeness of the board be pleasantly calming?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I have been playing the basic set with no expansions for 
well over a year now and I'm still enjoying Carcassonne. 
There is a lot of strategy involved which operates
on a very simple level, satisfyingly nuanced without
need for a complicated rules system. 

The game is watertight, I would not make any changes to the 
core rules at all. It's a great pick up and play game that
has really nice wooden pieces that don't intimidate my non gamer friends and you can finish a game in 20 minutes, perfect.

Good 2-player although wouldn't want to play with more than 4. Expansions are almost necessary to increase the number of tiles thereby reducing the luck of the tile draws. Farmer scoring can result in huge point swings which exacerbates luck. Still, for its length it is a good game and I used to play it a lot (it was my gateway).

One of my all time favorite Euro games and what got me into the hobby. I have most of the expansions since I picked up the Big Box.

UPDATE: Carcassonne will always have a special place in my heart because it was my gateway into this world of modern board games. Unfortunately, in the midst of other awesome games that have been acquired and played, Carc's rating has been lowered and taken its due place in my board game chronicle(Village reference). It's not dead though, there's just other games that I'd rather play. It is nice to break out during a nice afternoon.

RATING: 7
Carcassonne does remarkably well to bridge the gap between people who just want to play a light game, and people who want to play some deep strategy. One person can dally along and fill in the gaps while the other can go savage on each other, raid farms and cities, and both will enjoy themselves. Unless you prevent those holes from ever being filled, then people get annoyed. But still!

[b]Comment:[/b] This is the classic game of tile laying where you create an entire landscape. This game more than any other taught me more expansions does not a better game make. In fact, this is easily expanded beyond playability. If you are an expansion-aholic like me, keep track of how many tiles the base game has, and incorporate no more expansions at one time than would double the basic game length. This game also has lots of downtime between turns. I love it as a classic, but with Carcassonne South Seas and Carcassonne The City, I wouldn't recommend this game at this point.

If you are interested in it, keep the expansions to the following and you'll do fine:

[thing=2993][/thing]

Ich verstehe, warum dieses Spiel ein Klassiker ist und schätze es dafür, dass es für Nicht-Spieler ein guter Einstieg in die Welt der Brettspiele ist. Mir hat es allerdings überhaupt keinen Spaß gemacht, es gab keine Spannungskurve, ein zu geringes Maß an Taktik und ich habe mich schlichtweg gelangweilt.

While the tile draw is totally random, there are lots of decisions on what you can do with that tile. Go for points with a city, road, or farmer? Try to block or limit points on one of your opponents? Negotiate some kind of deal to help you in the future? 

While there are better games of this type, the simplicity of the play and visual appeal make the game more accessible to more people so I get to have fun with people that won't play some of my

Lost horrible my first play. So The fun factor went down a little.

Gone from 7 to 8. I can still lose to a 7 year old and very close to a casual player, but I play it for fun and it's a "easy" game. By that I mean: you just dot down some tiles and you never know what's comming.

Very fun.

A tile laying game combining plenty of 'luck of the draw' with strategic token (meeple) placement. The scoring mechanism isn't intuitive (especially the farmers feeding the castles). If you don't know how the points are scored, you will always walk away from the game somewhat disappointed and feeling a bit cheated. Too light to warrant careful recollection of the fiddly scoring rules.

After a year or two I found myself wanting to play this again but it was a friend's copy and he had moved so I played a few games on my phone and it really reinforced some of the rules I was murky on before.  I ordered a new copy to give it a whirl, we shall see if it's better than I originally thought.

6.5 - I generally did not enjoy playing this game but it haunted my memories years and years later with questions about would I still hate it?  I decided to give it a second chance and so went out and purchased a new copy thinking that my tastes may have mellowed a bit.  When I first played this game I was barely into the board gaming hobby and I didn't like all the points and didn't like that it was just flipping tiles over.  Now that I have a better understanding of the mechanics I see a deeper strategy, blocking some areas while being a total sneak and jumping into someone else's town through clever placements.  Learning the tile pools helps a great deal as well so you aren't blindly hoping that a tile that doesn't exist comes up.  The game is definitely more fun and I occasionally feel an itch to play so I think it will be sticking around this time.

Yeah, I know, it's classic game. I know that it brought some innovative ideas to gaming world. I played it occasionaly several times, but I couldn't find it entertaining at all. I always had an impression that there must've been something missing in the rules, the game always seemed too easy. I tried to discover any in-depth, any hidden rule which would make the game more sophisticated and entertaining, but not succeeded. 

This game is THAT easy and I cannot recommend it. There are so many better games, why to waste time on that particular one?

My gateway game. A timeless classic. It will always hold a special place in my heart as the game that got me into board games. It's relatively simple and easy to play. The farm scoring and the "stealing in" mechanic takes a while to explain. After the game is over, there is an overwhelming sense of accomplishment after creating such a picturesque landscape. However, this game can be a bit too cutthroat. You can definitely hate-draft and make an opponent's structure almost impossible to complete, which is annoying and frustrating.

Carcassonne is a classic Euro game of tile laying, meeple placing (and is in fact the original source of the word, which of course is a portmanteau of "my people"). You place tiles, claim regions (in the most basic game, roads, cities, and monasteries). Closing off regions score them, roads can be shared in ties, cities are not, and cloisters score for being surrounded, and it's all very straightforward. 

I'd only played this game once before, with a copy I'd bought when I was in Germany, and that was before I really delved into Hobby gaming. I can understand why this game has a dozens of variants, expansions, mods, and other ephemera, and at the same time I can grasp why this game has a sorta odd place in the hobby games canon. It's fairly light, fairly strategic, super low conflict, and just right to bring people into the fold.

An eminently playable game. While there is a good mix of luck and strategy, as a player you are not overwhelmed with any single play. Seems to be better with fewer players (more strategy - less impact for luck). While fairly straight forward once you get use to it, it is not easy to explain to non-gamers.

One of my favorites. Easy to teach and a great intro to German games as well as tile-laying/placement. English version includes the river expansion which I enjoy (it is played before regular tiles. Even if strategy isn't your bag, most players will enjoy because of the formation of the city.

This is a good game, but NOT a good introductory game. It's a bit abstract, you have to think several turns ahead to be successful, and making early mistakes can ruin your chances.

A classic.  Who does not like Carcassonne.  It is fun building the country and trying to horn in on someones city or farm.  My one complaint is that each player should get an equal number of turns.

RATING: N/A
A lot of people started with Settlers of Catan, but I started with Carcassonne after reading about it on a friend's blog. After reading him gush about this game that had no board that he and his wife were playing together, I was intrigued. That was October of 2009, which was my entry to this whole world of modern games. 

As for the actual gameplay: I think this game scales well in a number of ways. It plays well 2p all the way to 4p, and it also plays well whether you want to play cutthroat or casually. You can modify it by having a hand of tiles, if you want, but we've played it where you draw a tile at the end of your turn so you can think about your move. 

Regardless, it's satisfying to grow a countryside, and the use of meeples is a great (and light) way to balance Now against Later. It's a very clever game, even this far after its release date. There really is something special about Carcassonne.

Sólo puedo decir que es un juego muy bonito y que es muy fácil que salga a mesa tanto como filler para jugones como juego de iniciación a no jugones.

Fácil de aprender, barato... Su único defecto es que acabas por aprenderte las fichas y puedes acabar jugando "de memoria". Para evitar esto en las partidas, recomiendo quitar al principio de la partida 2 fichas por jugador boca-abajo para reducir el "factor me sé las fichas que faltan."

Mejor si se acompaña con alguna expansión.

Two points:

This is the kind of game that you can break out for a evening with non-gamers and expect that everyone will have fun. The rules are very simple to learn, and it plays very quickly (45 minutes for a 4 player game). Be warned that there is a lot of luck involved in this game because the main play mechanic is to randomly draw tiles from a pile. However, there is also a lot of strategy involved in how to place them.

A játék, amit mindenkinek lehet ajánlani. A tökéletes bevezőjáték a társásjátékok világába. Sokkal többet játszottam vele, mint azt az itt mutatott statisztika jelez, csak még a BGG előtti időkben.

Egyszerű, lapkalerakós játék. Ahol döntési helyzetet jelent, hogy hová tesszük a bábut, milyen területrésszel akarunk magunknak pontokat szerezni.

A great and simple tile laying game that can be incredibly cutthroat with the right group, or nice and relaxed if you choose to play it in such a way. I probably have the most plays of any game in this one.

RATING: 8
Upfront: I would really hate Carcassonne if it didn't have The River expansion. Starting with a single tile in this game is really unpleasant. Starting with a few on-table improves the game significantly.

I'd like to see a variant that involves a hand of tiles, or draw-3-pick-1 or something, because the game is pretty reliant on players drawing the right tiles at the right time.

My Dad and I have been playing this for years now and he loves it, so do I. The perfect balance between easy to learn, hard to master. I have not tried any of the expansion yet and I am looking forward to it.

EDIT: Played this a lot more times than I registered plays for. Still a great game, perfectly simple and addictive. Works great with 2-3 players.

Carcassonne is another game that can really be fun to play equally for children and adults. When I was packing for the Peace Corps this was the only game I brought with me, and thank god I did - the children at my center learned it easily (despite the language disparity) and they just loved it. I'm fairly confident that Carcassonne has strong potential for both educational and therapeutic application, as well as being an excellent way to pass the time.

Is Carcassonne a bland co-op or cut throat jigsaw puzzle?  That, my friends, is up to you.

Carcassonne is simple.  A bunch of tiles show parts of cities and roads surrounded by green fields and containing the occasional abbey.  The components are quite lovely.

On their turn a player draws a tile and places it, puzzle like, next to a previously played tile.  Roads and Cities spill over onto multiple tiles and as the game progresses.  After placing a tile a player can place a meeple (the rules call them "followers") on any structure in that tile.  If that tile, however, expands a pre-existing structure, a road for example, that already has a meeple on it, then no new meeple can be played on that structure.

When a tile completes a structure, ending a road for example, any meeples on it are removed from the board and the owning players score points based on the size of the structure.  The game ends when all the tiles are drawn at which time end game points are awarded and the person with the most points wins.

Now the rules state that on a turn a player is supposed to draw a tile and discuss with the other players how best to play it.  Two words: BO RING.

Here's how you should play Carcassone: 

First draw your tile at the end of your turn so you can think about where to play when your next turn begins.  

Second, it's possible for cities, roads and fields with meeples already on them to grow together.  If they do, the player or players with the most meeples on the structure get the points.  Yes, you can steal points from other players this way!

Third, unless a structure gets completed a player can't get their meeples back.  They are stuck on the board.  Clever tile play can lock up other players meeples and reduce their scoring opportunities.

On one hand Carcassonne provides many of the fun puzzle solving elements that one can find in jigsaw puzzles.  But it can also be played in a competitive fashion.  These two elements combined make it one of the best family games out there.  It's simple to play, fast and full of interaction.

I've heard complaints on BGG about down time issues in multiplayer games.  I've never experienced such a problem, presumably because we always play such that a player draws a new tile at the end of their turn rather than at the beginning.

This was one of my first "modern" games, back when I played it in the early two thousands. A great tile laying game, with a luck factor yet plenty of strategic options and possibilities for dirtbaggery. 
I love it when a plan comes together in this game. Especially if it happens in the final turns. Still it can be rewarding to see an opponent make a great move and rake up the points.
The building your board concept also factors into the equasion for me. 

Played this mostly with two and I would like to see how it scales.

Note that I don’t particularly care for tile-laying games that involve edge matching. I really thought Dad would like this game; he doesn't care for it at all. Is it because of the farmers? Or is it because my dad doesn't have the patience to look all over the playing area to find an appropriate place to play his tile? This game is mostly all about short-term strategies; you’re building little things, accumulating points here and there. I’d rather build something larger – the farmers’ rule is close to what I mean, but the difficulty to attack those farmers that your opponents control doesn’t make this part of the game dynamic enough.

Its a franchise! The main tile-laying game around I guess. Great components easy to learn and easy to play. Pick up a tile, add to tiles already played, stick a man on the tile. What could be easier? What is superb about the game is that the simple mechanic creates a game with multiple strategy and tactical layers. Is surprisingly deep, but allows all players to enjoy at the level they are playing the game.

Played a very close 4p game last night, using the tiles only from several expansions, not the rules. It was a great game.

I know it's a simple straight forward game, but that's what I like about it. I think this game is a good marriage of strategy and luck. (Note: My rating and comments reflect play with two players. I think two players is the optimal number for this game. I've played with more than two players and the game just doesn't play as well, IMHO. Three players is o.k. Any more players and the game gets too luck driven and chaotic and my rating for it becomes a 3.)

I approached the Carc franchise backwards - Hunters & Gatherers, Castle, Arc of the C and then the base game. Found it a head spin to score all uncompleted roads and castles, to have so many odd tiles and to have the farmers so potent...they're vital. I prefer H&G, it's more tactical and there's more happening, but I'm always willing to play a base game of Carc.

Gosto da imprevisibilidade do jogo, e das disputas pelas grandes cidades, pela melhor aposta nas fazendas, etc. Certamente há muita coisa melhor para se jogar, mas esse pra mim é um dos pilares dos boards, e que estará por aí durante muitos e muitos anos.

This game isn't nearly as good as I expected from the hype.  If you or your opponent/s don't understand how to steal points away or to prevent point scoring, the game becomes just a very simple game of placing your drawn tile where it fits.  I've yet to lose a game of carcassonne simple because no one I've played has caught on to the deeper strategies involved in scoring.  Kids love it though.  The expansion does help to make it more interesting and balanced. Update:  After a year of playing other great games, this just doesn't seem to compare.  There is so much luck involved that it isn't fun.  I bought the Traders and Builders expansion to hopefully make the game less luck dependent but it makes the game much more difficult to teach.  I'll pass and play something else.

This game falls into the category of "A minute to learn, a lifetime to master."

I love this game because of it's outward simplicity, but very subtle complexity.  

What you have here is a tile and worker placement game that has a myriad of strategies and can appeal to anyone, any age, anywhere.

Great game.  One of the best for a quickie when you don't have a lot of time.  Easy to learn.  Those who say there is no strategy could not have played this much.  Tons of strategy-- some obvious, some not so.  Hardest part is back-door joining onto other's farms to steal their points.  Bets as a 3-4 player game, as the 5 player does not give you enough time to develop a board strategy.   Few people will NOT like this game, and it may be a good one to lure new friends into gaming, as it is so easy to catch on to.

Some will say that this game is too light, too pervasive, not deep enough, blah blah blah. This game is great. It's fun. Kids and adults can learn it and play it in minutes. The expansions can add some strategic depth if you desire that.

This is a quick, simple, and yet challenging game.  I found newcomers were able to pick it up quickly and it's fast enough that you can play a few times in a row to get the hang of it.  I bought it for a friend who occasionally plays board games with us and her and her boyfriend absolutely love playing it.

There are always pivotal decisions to be made over where and when to place workers and turns generally move quickly.  You always feel like you are in control of you play and you won't find yourself waiting long  for your next turn.

The random tile draw can make developing a strategy difficult, but by counting tiles, you can usually make some informed bets on whether or not a strategy will work. It can be frustrating when it doesn't work out, but the tension of finding out is half the fun of the game.

Despite this, it's a lot of fun to build up the map and there are enough big payoffs throughout to make you feel that you've played successfully.  It's a good, quick game that newbies will take to with ease.  It's great to play as a time-filler when waiting for somebody to show up or when you don't have a lot of time for a longer game.

However, there are a couple places where the game can really slow down.  Figuring out what fields are attached and who owns them can interfere with placing workers.  Also, the points often aren't clear until the end of the game, at which point it can take several minutes to add up the score while everybody else waits.  It does make for a suddenly slow ending to an otherwise fast-paced game.

I recommend this as a game for younger kids, for playing with new gamers, and for a quick game when deeper games just aren't appropriate.  If you prefer more strategy, you may find this game gets old after a while, but it's simple enough to explain and get the hang of for new comers to quickly take to it and the game offers plenty of depth to keep strategists entertained.

Over a year since getting this, several of my friends now have their own copies. I've also introduced many non-gamers to it and they absolutely loved it. This is a great gateway game!

My favorite thing about Carcassonne is that you can step back after you are done and marvel at your beautiful map with the feel that you've built something.  I hate it though, when you've got something you've been working towards for a large part of the game that gets thwarted because you didn't draw the right tile.  I know there are many people who would say that seasoned Carcassonne players never get themselves into that situation, but I am not that good and will probably never be that good.  I don't enjoy Carcassonne enough to get that good.

The lesser known fact about Carcassonne is it's actually a brutal, cutthroat two-player game.  Add more players, and things get much more random.  I own the Big Box and find playing with more than two expansions just bogs down an ordinarily more fluid game.

A light and still very enjoyable game what brought us the meeples. It was the winner of the "Spiel des Jahres" in 2001(?), and it wasn't a coincidence. Expect a lot of expansions!! Great gateway game!

With too many expansions at the same time it can be a bit loooong... and not so gateway.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Unpopular opinion incoming: Carcassonne is very overrated. Don't really like it. Kingdomino and Isle of Skye does tile laying better.

I dislike when games don't reward you for pulling of timely combos. In Carcassonne, you could begin a city on your very first turn, and it would make no difference if you complete it in the 2nd round or in the 20th round.

I read a lot of comments from people talking about how great this is 2 player, but I think it really shines 3 player.  I like the dynamic and interplay that is there with three, choosing who to screw over, banding a big castle together only benefiting two of the players, etc.  I think in the two player game it's too easy to do what you want and to cancel moves out.  The third player not only adds another force to be reckoned with, but adds another person drawing tiles into the mix, therefor diluting the number that you will draw.  It does this while not diluting it so much that the game feels out of your control, which I htink starts to happen with 4 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Not quite as fun as the hype had led me to believe, but still enjoyable. I'm hoping that with a few of the expansions, it'll get more fun. Visually, it looks a little weird which bothers me sometimes.

RATING: 7.5
I know of no other game that is as open to both casual and serious gamers as Carcassonne. It is deceptively simple. The game is amazingly open to expansion and only after about a half dozen expansions does the game start to feel too busy. Basically, you can customize Carcassonne to fit your groups play style. Turns flow smoothly. Scoring is easy. Did I mention it's fun?

Update:
After many years of Carcassonne, I still think it a great gateway game, but I have almost entirely moved on. A few of the MANY expansions were a big pass for me.

Carcassone by itself is a little too vanilla for me.  The fields are just *so* important that I think it hurts the game (roads are near useless).  If you add in Inns & Cathedrals and Traders & Builders, the game becomes *much* better in my opinion, as there are other avenues to victory.

It is also quite an attractive game when set out on a table, and is simple enough to use as a nice "gateway" game.

My favorite game when played with Inns and Cathedrals, Traders and Builders and a house rule with the Robber only: the Robber is awarded to the person who OWNS (NOT COMPLETES) the longest road, which entitles him/'her to one point for every completed road, usually 15-20.  This increases the value of the road pieces you pull, and provides perfect balance to the game.

Description: Tile laying, city building, territory building, area control, light family game with meeples and medieval French castles theme.
Weight: Light.
Number of players: 2 to 6. Best with 4.
Designer: Rudolf Ross, Klaus-Jürgen Wrede.
Publisher: Z-Man Games.

Impression: Classic tile placement family game that I am very fond of. It also popularized the meeples, which is now official Oxford dictionary word. So far I only played basic game, and few expansions not included in this Big Box, like the Tower, and I can't wait to try it out with the rest of it.

Likes: Tile placement mechanic. Easy to learn and play. Various viable strategies. Scoring tiles which gives you back your meeples. Admiring the kingdom you built together in the end.

Dislikes: Bookkeeping and exhausting scoring in the end. Unfair randomness of tile distribution (easily overcome with the house rule). Some expansions bloating the game.

Like most people, just love it.  Here's our House Rule that I recommend:  HOLD one tile in hand, so that at beginning of turn you are drawing a 2nd into your hand.   This helps diminish the Luck by just a little, and it gives you something to do during other people's turns (looking at the board to figure where your in-hand tile could be placed).  Always fun and challenging.

You start from a single tile and then develope a whole country side: the formula for a great gateway Euro game.

Carcassonne was one of the first games I ever bought. The game is easy to learn but is complex enough that you won't get tired of it. It is one of those games where you can become a real a$$ by trying to steal other's cities and all. I recommand that game for someone who is new to board gaming but also, to experienced players who wants to have a nice time with a game that isn't too long nor too complex but is still very enjoyable. When you get used to it, go and buy some extensions, they will expand the gameplay experience even more.

I used to play a lot of Yugioh at my local games store (Mind Games Albury) every Friday night. Sometimes we'd get bored of Yugioh though and so we'd play a store copy of a board game. That's how I came across Carcassonne.

I don't play the game much byitself anymore (I almost always play it with the Princess and Dragon expansion which I LOVE!), but I have fond memories of flipping over cloister after cloister, much to the annoyance of my opponents :D I also love getting the 4 sided city piece, placing it in an opponents city to make it virtually impossible to finish!

É um dos reis dos jogos de tabuleiro e com expansões a coisa fica viciante. Recomendavel a todos os que queiram passar bons momentos em sociedade.

Tile placement game. Players randomly draw tiles and must match them to the currently played tiles to recreate the region of Carcassonne. In doing so, players build roads, cities, farms and cloisters. Players can claim such constructions as theirs and score points when the road, city, or cloister is completed. Farmers score at the end of the game for each city to which they supply food. Always an enjoyable game.

It has been a terrific game for my wife and me to start getting into "real" games.  We realize it's not a particular "heavyweight" game compared to a lot of others, but coming on the heels of Ticket to Ride it's been keep the gaming momentum going.  Defintely my wife's favorite game to play (along with the Inns and Cathedrals expansion).

Update (Feb. '09): It was the second "real" game we bought.  But now (with 75 or so games) we really don't play it but once every few months.  Still fun.  Haven't been able to get many kids in my h.s. boardgaming club into it.  Thought I might.

Update (May '09): down from 9 to 8.

Update (July 2013): Over the winter, Carcassonne was a complete shocker in my first ever Top 200 Games List. It grabbed the #12 spot even though I hadn't played it in many, many months and pretty much only play it with my wife. So I moved the rating up to a 9.5. And now my wife and I are playing it a good bit over the summer.

Used to love it, but I've gotten kind of tired of it.  It is a wonderful game though.  Plays VERY differently with 2 players than it does with 5.  With 2 players, you must play very cut-throat to win.  With 5, you have to cooperate or the game becomes virtually meaningless.

An excellent tile-laying game and, with its affordable price point, it's an easy one to recommend to friends who are just being introduced to Designer Games. I have a number of the expansions and my only frustration is that each one adds to the length of the game, making it drag on a little too long. Scoring can also be a lengthy process, with farmers often being difficult to explain to newcomers.

This game has given me hours of pleasure. I really liked it until..... uuhhmmm until... yeh until what exactly? I think it just lost my interest. Some games just have that. 

Probably it is because of the game mechanics. They are great, but when you (and your opponent) successfully skilled yourself with the tactics it is simply a game of dumb luck (who gets the right tile at the right time).

I have a grudging respect for Carcassonne, and I'll agree to play it when in the right mood. For all that it has a reputation as a family game and a gateway game, in can get pretty vicious between experienced gamers (particularly the field battles - I normally lose because I miss a connection somewhere...). I'm OK to play this about 3 or 4 times a year, usually with non-gamers - but wouldn't want to play any more often. It just doesn't have any features which I particularly like.

A simple and subtle game with enough luck in to ensure that the most experienced player does not always win but enough scope to have a really good tactical game. Plays really well on www.brettspielwelt.de. I recommend anyone who likes this game and needs partners to go play on there.
One of the few games where expansion packs actually add to the game rather than just making it more complicated and longer. I am against expansion packs as a rule but these genuinely enhance the game options.

This was one of the first Euro games I ever bought. I had a hard time getting my wife interested, but my buddies and I enjoyed it quite a bit. I like the "screw your neighbor" aspect of edging in on other peoples' cities or cutting off their farmers. I haven't purchased any expansions, but I might in the future. There's a bit of luck in the tile draw, but it doesn't usually outweigh strategy. Scoring is kind of a pain and definitely contributed to some people I played with not becoming interested.

UPDATE: My 7 year old daughter loves this game! We play without farmers, but it's still fun. I'm bumping up to an 8 due to her liking it so much.

I tried to like this game, I really did.

But in the end, I was the only one who 'liked' it, and I was only pretending. 

The reality is that this game sucks, it always sucked, and everyone pretended to like it because it was popular and foreign and famous and so we were all supposed to like it.

I'll give it a 4, take it or leave it, whatever. Probably will never play it again, but we had some fun games here and there, even if they were boring, mostly.

So I sold it on ebay for 5 bucks..

RATING: 8
This was our gateway game and it still remains high on our playlist. We prefer the basic game plus the River expansion (helps make farm scoring more strategic). Other "bigger" expansions can change the game too much by adding luck/random/aggressive components. Inns & Cathedrals does the best job of maintaining the basic game while adding more strategy. Traders and builders is another that enhances the basic mechanics. Carcassonne scales pretty well 2-4 with 2 being a bit more cut-throat and 3 being the "sweet spot". 5-6 becomes slower and more random.

I like Carcassonne. It can be a little frustrating at times, with tiles not going your way, but it's a relatively simple idea for a game with a bit of strategy going along with it. 

The major issue I might have is that there's not much to do between turns. As your entire turn involved drawing the top tile from the pile, figuring out where to place it and then putting it down, then placing a meeple somewhere on that square - there's really not much to do outside of your turn. You can't really plan ahead in this one.

So while it can be fun, it's just a once in a while type game for me.

Seriously, you build castles consisted of two parts (because you have no other choice) and someone just put his farmer at medow and counts three for it?! That's really not fair.

Nice game with simple rules where you have that Euro thing that you compete by trying to be more efficient than everyone else but with a bit of "in your face" component since you can steal or join other players features (cities, farms, etc). These "steals" are not necessarily zero sum if you are playing multiplayer which adds a very interesting layer to the game.

What a beauty this game is. Although I'm rarely itching to play Carcassonne, I know I will still enjoy it 50 years from now (in the unlikely event that I am still alive despite all the smoking, drinking and fighting). Because like Elijah Wood and other fairy creatures, Carcassonne refuses to get old.

RATING: 7
For such a simple game, carcassonne has a nice balance of cooperation/competition, 
conservative/aggressive use of resources (meeples), attack and defense, utilizing different functions of each tile's features.  As a result, even though the game is about taking and putting down a single tile and a single wooden piece each turn, it's got a lot to think about.  All this would probably induce analysis paralysis if it weren't for the fact that you get to show your situation to your opponents, who then can offer 'helpful' suggestions (sometimes really helpful if they're nice, sometimes some sort of 'let's help each-other' kind of move).  This makes the game a bit social.  Not as social as a trading game like Settlers of Catan, but nice, tea-time manners, social.  I personally like rowdier games or more thought-provoking games, but still i enjoy it when i'm in the right mood--a bit sedate and polite, like with a church group or something.

This is probably the game which gets the most playtime at the moment, especially between myself and my partner.  It's also great for teaching to new players, scales extraordinarily well to the number of players and has a level of player interaction which allows a decent level of competition without feeling too vindictive (my partner is *extremely* conflict-averse).  A definite winner - I'd love to try some of the other versions.

~~lot of 3&4pl games with base set~

i was less than enamoured with carc h&g when i tried it but something just clicked for the good when i tried this one - we always play with 2 tiles in hand - which is a MUST imho ). Yeah sure the farmer's are intuitive but there's just a very nice feel to the game. plays well with NGs and gamers alike.

 have tried some of the expansions -jury's still out on these but i dont think ANY are in fact necessary inc inns and cathedrals. i do plan to get two base sets and combine them just to have more tiles tho

i never thought i'd say it but this a MUST-HAVE for any collection and a great gift idea for anyone at all really

edit - recently played with 6 players (3 game noobies) using 2 full base sets and had a blast :)

edit - played over new years with 8 ppl and 3 base sets and STILL grt fun! everyone i showed this too loved it and everyone watching wanted to play or buy it. 

this game should be THE game EVERYONE plays

NOTE - it prob is more luck than skill but is so much fun i forgive it this and besides it mean noobies have a chance of winning so it keeps them coming back for more :)

Carcassonne remains one of my favorite games. Yes, it is a fairly light game with a fair amount of luck in it, but the fun really comes from the group you play with. The players make this game SOOO much fun! Also, I have not yet run into a person who doesn't like Carcassonne, which also just adds to how great a game this is.

The expasions really add to this game. They give it more variability and replay value. Also, if you want a more strategic game for instance you can use specific expansions to do that. Or if you want a game of Carc with lots of confrontation, or maybe one without much of any confrontation. Due to all the expasions for it, Carcassonne easily beats any of the other Carc games in my opinion.

I bought the physical copy because I own the Window version.  I bought the window version first b/c I had points to burn.

You can imagine what happened...what a deep, simple yet ingenious game!

Mi primer eurogame, uno de mis juegos favoritos, muy bien implementado en la BSW. En mundoreal me gusta jugarlo con una variante casera, que consiste en que cada jugador siempre tiene dos losetas en la mano, y roba una. Aumenta la estrategia a dos o tres turnos vista y disminuye el azar del robo a ciegas. Mucho más divertido porque se juega más agresivo.

My rating is based on the following conditions:

1. Play with a hand of 3 tiles.
2. Includes several expansions, especially Inns and Cathedrals.
3. Has 2 or 3 players (no more).

We are pretty evenly matched so the game play is tense right up to the finish, and that is what we all want in a game.

It really is the best game for introducing new people to our hobby (sorry TTR and Settles) based on the 100+ people I have taught this to.

If you are thinking of buying this I would buy one of the "Big Box" versions, it saves you some money and you will want the expansions anyway.

This game has grown on me over time.  The iphone/ipad implementation is quite good.  Great for a casual game, but enough tactics to keep it interesting.  The one thing I don't like is the ability to lock an opponent's meeple onto the board.  the computer is particularly good at this since it can easily keep a list of used tiles in it's memory and determine how to make a space unplayable.  Humans are not so good at that.

My relations with Carcassonne are of love-hate type that averages on mediocre. First it was Ok, but got boring very quickly. Then after a long break I tried it again with my wife and surprisingly liked it. We played it more and it quickly flipped to other extreme.
Now I don't mind playing it and appreciate simplicity and (even today!) freshnest of game mechanics, it's cute look and zen-ness, but eventually it's too random and lacks enough interesting decisions for my taste.
Carcassonne highly customizable with expansions (and this box has ones of the best), you can always find something more to your liking, but they detract from purity of base game and don't change it's feel that much anyway.
I'm still keeping it though. If anything it still is a classic.
* * * UPDATE 30/01/17 * * *
My feelings had another turn. Throwing in all expansions I own, though totally crazy, brought game to another level. If you have a few expansions mixed in, the game is dominated by that expansion-specific mechanics. But you have a lot in the mix, their impact spreads thinner and often competes with another expansion, creating tension and harmony. You want to build bigger cities and roads to get King/Robber, but now there is threat of towers and dragon, so what do you do? The towers are diluted by other expansions and are not ever-present threat, and if you do get knocked out, you still have an option to take it back with Count's help. And so on. The game becomes epic. So does play time, setup and takedown, but so far it's my favourite way to play and elevates game to 7/10.
* * * UPDATE 2/04/17 * * *
Vanilla Carcassonne grew on me a little. It's not a good game, but it's an enjoyable experience. And at least it plays fast, Carcassonne with all expansions is way too time consuming.

Каркассон и множество дополнений – это очень круто. Но не вздумайте мешать их все в одну кучу, а потом ещё и рисковать играть в это. Умрете от усталости.
Лучше дополнить базу одним-двумя дополнениями и сыграть за минут 40. Вот это получится Каркассон. А вот игра длительностью в половину дня с картой, растянутой через всю комнату. Прибавьте сюда вечно атакующую кошку. И вы поймёте – что такое просранные впустую часы жизни.

A clever tile laying game where you take turns building the ancient town of Carcassonne in France. Different tile alignments allow you to score a little or a lot of points. How you place the tiles can really help you or really stifle your opponent. The rules are simple but they supply a surprising amount of strategy and depth to the gameplay. Very enjoyable and engaging. One of the automatics for any game collection.

Brilliant! Part puzzle, part board game, this game has intriguing and nearly endless possibilities, even without the expansion sets. My kids played it and understood it when they were 9, but it's interesting enough for board game geeks like me. And when the kids get tired of the strategy, they can just fit the tiles together to make one giant city.

Dominoes + Meeples = Yawn.  Pick a tile, lay a tile, lay a meeple (maybe).  Much better gateway alternatives out there.

RATING: 5
fast tile laying  game where you lay tile to extend roads, farms, cities or churches. The key to the game is to use your workers and tile placement to get the most points.

Pros: Short game length, appeals to wide variety of people, still  fairly strategic given the game length

Cons: can include luck aspect, can introduce alpha gamer mentality in certain groups.

RATING: 7
Great game to play with anyone who is new to gaming, including the significant other. Simple rules but I think pretty deep gameplay. You can play it lightly and have fun, or you can play it much more competitively and plan long term and have a satisfying game. Plays almost too fast with more than two players. We always play with some expansions, which are almost a necessity with more than two players. I can play this game a lot and not get tired of it as long as I play some other games to add some variety to the evening. Familiarity with the tile deck, I believe, can minimize the results of "bad" tile draws.

Like many others here, Carcassonne, along with Settlers of Catan, is primarily responsible for my headlong plunge into a full-blown gaming addiction. Unfortunately, I know far to many people with Carcassonne and Settlers "burn out." Therefore, I don't get to play this game nearly as much as I'd like. Not sure how I escaped unscathed, but the fact remains: I still love this game!

Much like vanilla Settlers, it's difficult to rate the base game by itself with knowledge of all the expansions and spin-offs, and that's without taking into account the newest edition of the rules. The revised rules were certainly for the best, especially considering the simplified farm scoring.

For such a simple set of rules, this game seems to contain a satisfying amount of depth. The experience is even better when players play aggressively. Inns and Cathedrals manages to successfully iron out a few of the wrinkles when it comes to balance, particularly the road scoring, but even without the expansion, the game is still playable and contains a lot of charm. There's nothing like glomming onto a huge city your opponent was about to finish, or connecting your wimpy farm with your opponent's massive one. I think the game plays best with 3, it's okay with 4, and I avoid it with 5. Downtime gets annoying with 4 to 5 players. It's also a perfectly adequate 2 player game.

If you've ever played Entdecker, you'll realize how much Carcassonne owes to its tile laying predecessor. Claus Jurgen-Wrede managed to pull the most enjoyable mechanic from this early Teuber effort, and turn it into a brilliant, addicting gateway experience.

RATING: 8.5
A perfect entry-level game. I've played this with a huge variety of people, and all have enjoyed it. Simple mechanics, clear rules (the farms usually get people the first game, but that makes them more eager for the second). Hard to master, and newcomers have a shot at winning their first game (if you don't go too cut-throat on them).

Two Player Value = Good.  A little more competitive with more players though.

Three Player Value = Excellent.  A little more competitive with more players though.


I am not going to go into a lot of detail explaining Carcassonne.  By now everyone knows what the game is and how to play.

I believe it is enough to say that Carcassonne is one of the grandfathers of the gaming hobby and is clearly the frontrunner of tile-laying games.

This game is easy to teach and the learn.  Even learning by reading directly from the rules is simply.  That makes it a great game for beginners.  Yet even well seasoned gamers find the game enjoyable.

That is because everything just sort of fits with Carcassonne.  

The components are very nice.  Thick cardboard was used.  The artwork is likewise.  Not flashy, but it fits well.

The theme is interesting and fits the game wonderfully.

The mechanics are completely solid and fit the theme well.

This an all-around excellent game.


Pros - 
- Fun
- Great mechanic
- Simply to learn and play
- Innovative for its time


Cons - 
- Many of the expansions are out of print and hard to get

Here I will discuss the [thing=2993][/thing] expansion as played during the Carcassonne Project.


[b]New Components[/b] - 
- 6th player pieces.
- Big meeple worth two normal meeples.
- 18 Tiles.  Most are either new city tiles or Inns on road tiles.  One Cloister. 


[b]New Mechanics[/b] - 
- The Bigger Meeple offers new strategy for control of structures.
- Inns on roads and the Cathedrals in cities offer more points for finished structures respectively.  But offer zero points for unfinished structures at end of game.


[b]Thoughts[/b] - 
- This is a great expansion.  Easy to learn and play.  No complicated rules.  And it blends into the base game easily.
- The Big Meeple is great for take-overs and you can really start playing the game on the attack.
- The bonus points on finished structures is really nice, but it makes you plan ahead a lot more.  Unfinished structures will not score at End Game any more and many times the points for unfinished structures makes the difference.


[b]------------------------------------------------------[/b]


Here I will discuss the [thing=5405][/thing] expansion as played during the Carcassonne Project.


[b]New Components[/b] - 
- 24 tiles with all but two containing city parts.  
- 20 Goods Tokens
- Pig Meeples for each color
- Builder Meeples for each color


[b]New Mechanics[/b] - 
- The new city tiles have Goods on them.  The player that finishes a city collects those Goods present in that city.  End game offers a new scoring mechanic for majority control for each of the three Goods at 10 points each.
- Pig Meeple can be added to a Farmer to increase the value of Farms at End Game.
- Builder Meeple is added to a structure a player already has a Meeple in/on.  In later turns if that player adds to that structure the Builder allows the player to take a single extra turn.


[b]Thoughts[/b] - 
- Fantastic expansion.  
- Maximizing the Builder get nasty quick.  It is wonderful and adds a layer to the game where other players want to finish your structures to limit your extra turns.  Turns the game so players often play tiles defensively.
- The Goods add a cool new scoring feature that can alter the End Game just enough to tip the scales.  Also adds to the defensive play of the Builder as players will want the Goods.


[b]------------------------------------------------------[/b]


Here I will discuss the [thing=2591][/thing] expansion as played during the Carcassonne Project.


[b]New Components[/b] - 
- 12 tiles with sections of River on them, include a Spring to start the River and a Lake to end it.  Some tiles also have structures on them.


[b]New Mechanics[/b] - 
- This is a new way to begin the game.  Players first build the River and can place Meeples on the River tile structures.  This sort of seeds the game.  Then the game is played as normal.

[b]Thoughts[/b] - 
- This is a great new way to begin the game.  Much better than the single start tile.


[b]------------------------------------------------------[/b]


Here I will discuss the [thing=7707][/thing] expansion as played during the Carcassonne Project.


[b]New Components[/b] - 
- 7 new tiles.  5 Structure tiles with one King tile and one Scout tile.


[b]New Mechanics[/b] - 
- This expansion offers a new scoring mechanic.  The King and the Scout each score bonus end game points.  The King is awarded to the player that built the largest city and grants 1 point per completed city at game end.  The Scout is the same but with Roads.


[b]Thoughts[/b] - 
- A simple expansion that offers a fun new scoring mechanic.


[b]------------------------------------------------------[/b]



Here I will discuss the [thing=12903][/thing] expansion as played during the Carcassonne Project.


[b]New Components[/b] - 
- 12 new tiles that make up the City of Carcassonne and a new Count of Carcassonne meeple.


[b]New Mechanics[/b] - 
- The City of Carcassonne is a new way to begin the game.  The game starts with the City of Carcassonne already in play.  The city is comprised of four sections; Cathedral for Cloisters, Blacksmith for roads, Castle for Cities, and Market for farms.
- Each time a player finishes a structure for another player and scores no points for themselves, that player can add one of their meeples to the City of Carcassonne into one of the sections of the city.  That player may also move the Count of Carcassonne to another city section.
- On later turns when a structure is scored a player may remove his meeple from the corresponding part of the city to score that same amount of points or add to his majority/minority control of that structure.
- The section of city the Count of Carcassonne occupies is closed and may not be used.


[b]Thoughts[/b] - 
- This can be a rather nasty addition to the game and can make for brutal games as everyone fights for control and points of structures.  But it is fun addition to the game as well.
- This expansion takes more long term strategic planning.  Players need to account for meeples leaving the city and stealing points and plan to do so themselves.  Furthermore you must be more careful with your meeples.  You will find yourself very short on available meeples if they are all in the city.


[b]------------------------------------------------------[/b]


Here I will discuss the [thing=15158][/thing] expansion.


[b]New Components[/b] - 
- 30 tiles all containing either a Volcano, a Dragon, a Magic Portal or Princess symbol
- Dragon meeple
- Fairy meeple


[b]New Mechanics[/b] - 
- The Volcano brings the Dragon into play and the Dragon flies to each Volcano as it enters play.
- The Dragon moves whenever a tile with the Dragon symbol enters play.  Each player moves the Dragon one tile orthogonally until it moves 6 total spaces.  The Dragon eats any player meeples on a tiles it is on.  The Dragon will not enter a tile with the Fairy meeple.
- The Magic Portal allows the player to place a meeple on any previously played tile obeying all normal tile laying rules.
- The Princess when played to a city containing any player meeple must remove a meeple from the city.
- The Fairy scores the controlling player 1 point at the beginning of his turn.  If a structure is scored and it contains the Fairy that structure scores an additional 3 points.  The Fairy protects against the Dragon.  When a player lays a tile, but does not play one of his own meeples, he may instead take control of the Fairy placing it on any tiles containing one of his meeples.


[b]Thoughts[/b] - 
- This expansion offers many new changes to the rules including new scoring mechanics and new attack mechanics.  Keeping all the new rules straight is difficult the first few plays.
- The Dragon can get really nasty and clear the board if the Volcano tiles are place well.
- The Magic Portal is meant to allow players to claim structures the Dragon or Princess has cleared of meeples.  But many times it is useless as there are no valid, nor any good, previously played but yet unscored and unclaimed tiles remaining.
- The Fairy often gets forgotten to score each turn given its nature of constantly moving around.
- The Princess can get nasty.  Don't accidentally place her in a city with only one of your meeples present because the Princess must remove a meeple.
- Overall I am not impressed with this expansion.  It is primarily about attacking the other players.  The attacks will either be vicious or completely useless.  The additional scoring mechanics are not really powerful enough to make a difference.


[b]------------------------------------------------------[/b]


Here I will discuss the [thing=18836][/thing] expansion.


[b]New Components[/b] - 
- 12 tiles with sections of River on them, include a Spring to start the River, a River fork and two Lakes to end it.  Some tiles also have structures on them.
- Some tiles contain additional components from prior expansions like an Inn or a Pig Farmer.


[b]New Mechanics[/b] - 
- This is a new way to begin the game.  Players first build the River and can place Meeples on the River tile structures.  This sort of seeds the game.  Then the game is played as normal.

[b]Thoughts[/b] - 
- This is a great new way to begin the game.  Much better than the single start tile.


[b]------------------------------------------------------[/b]


Here I will discuss the [thing=21385][/thing] expansion.


[b]New Components[/b] - 
- 18 Tiles each holding a Tower building place
- 30 Tower pieces
- 1 Tower that holds the tiles


[b]New Mechanics[/b] - 
- A large Tower now holds all the tiles.
- After a player lays a tile he may place a Tower piece instead of a follower.  It must go on an open Tower building place or on top of an existing Tower to further heighten that Tower.
- A meeples may be placed on top of a Tower to cap the Tower so it may not be further built and extended.
- Each Tower has an orthogonal area of influence equal to its height in Tower pieces.  Any opposing meeple within that area of influence may be taken Prisoner after adding a Tower piece.  The player takes that Prisoner meeple off the board and puts it with his meeple supply.  It is no longer in play and no longer adds its influence toward control.
- Prisoner meeples are given back to their controlling player once two players have taken each others meeples as Prisoners.  Or a player can pay 3 points to have a Prisoner meeple returned.


[b]Thoughts[/b] - 
- The Tower is silly.  I did fine without it holding the tiles.
- The Tower rule for taking Prisoners is extremely powerful.  Over powered in my opinion.  With 18 Tower tiles finding them is not difficult.  And with smart placing, you can easily put a Tower in a place to remove many meeples.  The overall effect is that is makes the game center around attacking your opponents.  
- Overall, I do not like this expansion much so it won't get played much.


[b]------------------------------------------------------[/b]


Here I will discuss the [thing=26615][/thing] expansion.


[b]New Components[/b] - 
- 12 Tiles.  Two of the new tiles are used with the two River expansions and are a new Spring and new Lake.  The remaining 10 tiles are new structure tiles.  1 tile has a pig farmer to boost Farmer scoring.


[b]New Mechanics[/b] - 
- No new mechanics.  This expansion uses the rules from the base game and a few other expansions.


[b]Thoughts[/b] - 
- This is a fun little expansion.  A few of the new structure tiles are interesting and not previously seen. 
- Always a good addition to any game.

This is a great  'Random' tile game.  There are many possibilities with each tile, and the randomness forces you to think carefully on each turn.  This one can turn into a route every no and then.

Update: After hearing some podcasters talk about thier carc-crazy group and hearing that the players have memorized the tile count, I can easily say I never want to play with those players.  This is far from a perfect information game and to play it as such is not only obsessive, it's kind of lame.

Aw man, this game is just good times. Good for at least one "Yes!" moment per game when you get just the right tile.

One time we were strapped for table space where we were playing, so we decided to play Carcassonne on an extremely long, narrow table (about fifteen inches wide and six feet long) and a variant was accidentally born: Carcassonne Valley.

This is my favorite choice when there is new players (especially girls). The game mechanics are tile and worker placement, very short learning curve (especially with the farmer-free variant), yet involing a lot of strategies. It is a good family game on Friday night, and could become an immense strategy game especially for 2-player. Almighty, huh? The basic game (with or without the expansion) is slightly biased on early farmer placers and cathedral drawers, but I feel I maybe wrong.

Not too complicated, but has some interesting twists.  Plenty of expansions if you want to see things get more intense.  A nice introduction to new-style games for your friends who only play Monopoly.  

This isn't my personal favorite game, but it's hard to miss just what a gem this one is for any experience level.  If someone plays this game once, they want to own a copy.

Getting Carcassonne marked the beginnings of the boardgame hobby for me. This was before I was even aware of the plethora of categories of games and before I knew of Euro or AT mast to pin my colors on. I can't remember what attracted me in Carc, or whether it came recommended by someone, but I can remember that initially I really enjoyed the game. I introduced it to just about anyone we had over, and it seemed to fit any group, any time and every mood. We played this with all counts, but most games, around half I'd wager, have been just the wife and I, and we played really cuththroat. No matter how I've changed and how what I value in games has shifted, one thing has clearly remained: I play for fun. In our 2P Carc, winning mattered, but having fun mattered more. And what was fun was contesting castles, nevermind how effective it was pointswise, and imagining what was happening, teasing each other and, sometimes, outsmarting the other and being outsmarted. Sadly, we've come to a point where I can't approach Carc with that same, open let's-have-fun-with-this -attitude I used to.  For better and for worse, I acquired a taste, and am unable to enjoy anything and everything. It's not with a heavy heart that I gave up Carc, or with teary nostalgia or anything soft like that, but it does remind me of a simpler time.

It didn't seem sensible to me to judge my blue carcassonne family separately, since we usually play with the fully expanded set, so this rating refers to my blue family as a whole.

Bought this as a New Year's present for my family (and myself). They love it! 
    The tiles are beautifully illustrated and games often create a nice looking landscape on the table while playing. The rules are truly "easy to learn, hard to master", it's one of those games where you don't have to beg non-gamers to play it. Once everyone's familiar with the rules, this can be played in a fairly short amount of time, including setup and break-down.
    With more players, this game becomes more dependent on good 'luck' in drawing the right tiles, as you'll be drawing less tiles.

Compared to the other big lightning-bolt games that broke into the mainstream, Carcassonne has always struck me as second-tier. It lacks the immediacy of both Catan and Ticket To Ride, and has probably been expanded and revamped a big too much for its own good.

That said, it's still a very good game. Its intuitive domino-like gameplay has the potential to be either cutthroat or gentle, sometimes in the same session. If you play with the Rio Grande version, be sure you use the Hans im Gluck scoring rules for farmers. It's also better with the first couple of expansions thrown in.

Carcassonne is pretty much the game that got me (and everybody else in the world, it seems) really into the hobby. This big box version was really the first hobby game I purchased. I can't describe the level of excitement I felt upon opening it. The added expansions this comes with really makes it the perfect way to experience Carcassonne. If you're going to get one Carcassonne iteration, make it this one.

A fun, light game. I wish people wouldn't overthink it as much as they do, as that leads to obnoxious downtime. I bought the deluxe edition and thus own various expansions. At first, I thought they detracted from the game.

Laid back, simple and clean tile placement game that is great fun if sometimes a bit strategically out of your hands. That's not a big deal, however, as the blind tile draw keeps the game moving and forces you to hedge your bets and take care when pressing your luck, because you may never close off that city, or you opponent may manage to take it over...

Valentine's Day 2012 gift from my wife :)

It's a great game for us, at this time in our lives. It was easy to learn, plays very quickly, and has a balanced, well implemented two player version. We can set our toddler down to play and finish a game within 10-15 minutes before he starts to fuss, or needs our attention.

Update: after having played this for several weeks, I wouldn't call it my favorite game. But it's still a good choice of game if you have 15-20 minutes on hand, and a fussy toddler that needs 30% of your attention.

Repeated plays, with and without the river tiles, have decreased my fondness for Carcassonne. Once players understand that farms are the key to victory, the game becomes less light. The resulting deliberation over tile placement can make the game drag.

RATING: 5
Everyone loves this game for some reason, but the lustre has dimmed for me lately. Now when I play, I almost always use some variant to bring down the time of the expanded game (leaving one third of the tiles in the box seems to work well, or you can use Richard Garfield's variant of adding the 50/100 tiles to the tile bag and stopping when three have been drawn).

Carc is the most successful gateway game in my collection, but it has a big problem in that it scales poorly. It's best with 2 players, good with 3 and okay with 4, but with 5 or 6 (as you often see in a gateway gaming situation), it's too random and too long. I've been playing a lot of 4, 5 and 6 player games lately, so I'm a bit burned out on it. Definitely best with 2P, but still too lucky to have staying power as anything other than a gateway / family game.

I would recommend keeping the expansions to a minimum: Inns & Cathedrals plus the tiles (but not the rules) from King & Scout. If you add too many expansions the game becomes fiddly and way too long, and you have to shorten it using one of the above variants. We usually play that after a tile has been placed, the player can draw a fresh tile to study during downtime. This is helpful also.

If you're uncertain whether to get a copy, I say go for it. It's relatively cheap and as a gateway game it's amazing. And meeples come in handy for other games: as player markers in Traders of Genoa, role selection markers in San Juan, etc.

Update: Hating this more. It has well and truly outstayed its welcome.

Update: The iPhone version is much better -- not so much downtime.

This is a tile laying game where players have a common pool of tiles to draw from, at random, and then play the drawn tile to add to the existing map.  Players score by assigning one of a limited set of wooden token to the tile they just played.  They get the token back once the road, building, cloister is complete, which is not always obvious when.  Players must decide where to place their tiles, and if they should commit a token to scoring off that tile.

This is how I got into german games in the first place! We play with the expansions, of course. Now that we have other games, this one isn't played nightly (as it was when it was our only game) but we still love it every time we bring it out.

One of the most beautiful aspects of this game is that the luck of tile drawing is ofset by the fact that you can always do something with the drawn tile in order to win points. Maybe not enough points, but at least the luck factor doesn't steam roll anyone.

ONGOING opinion:  This has evolved into my favorite (I have updated it's rating several times).  To me it has a very high replayability since each game is so different.  I just love to play.

EARLY Opinion: Among my favorites when we have 30 minutes and want to play a quick game.  Much better game when playing with the river expansion (came included) and while I originally thought it was much more luck than strategy I am starting to see how strategy can impact the game.  Luck is still a big component and you can't overcome bad tiles.  But you can finesse mediocre tiles into a pretty good score if you work it.

Als eines der viel gescholtenen "Gatewayspiele" ist Carcassonne immer noch einer meiner Lieblinge. Kapiert jeder, geht relativ flott und die organisch entstehende Landschaft ist nett anzuschauen.

I've read people describe it as mediative and relaxing - well I love to meditate, but if I want to meditate I'd rather do it alone and instead play something more engaging  with the people I'm with.

I've come to appreciate this game over time, but it's been a long road. These days I prefer it with four players and I think the odd lucky tile is outweighed by clever play and the fun of taking the odd risk. The basic game is fine.

I bought the very first German edition - where the rules for farmers were rather obtuse. Since then various rules about points scoring have been modified, so now I don't know what I'm playing until we run through the rules before a game and agree on them - usually depending upon what edition game we're playing. I'd suggest to the publishers that they start printing rules titles like "Big Box Carcassonne using fifth edition rules" on the cover, so we gamers could just start referring to the ruleset by edition numbers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
One of my most-played games. With 2 players, I would rate this higher than 8. With more, I don't think it's as good. The monasteries make it a bit random, but that's also part of why it's fun - it's always possible for weaker players to win,

One of my favourite gaming moments happened in Carcassonne when my father laid an early farmer and was surrounded by four of those L-shaped road tiles in the smallest field possible! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very analytical game that everybody likes at the first time.  Players place different kind of tiles to score points depending on where they leave their markers.  At the beginning it is fun, but later it becomes a really mind burner.  A nice game, but not to play it every day.

A unique mechanic of players draw random tiles to build a countryside with scattered cities for points.  A good games to introduce players to as it is more about building well that "crushing the other guy" in order to win.  A near perfect design: some randomness in drawing tiles to keep a high replay value, but enough "here or there?" decision making to give it plenty of strategic value.

RATING: 7
If I get this right, it's one of the origionators of the euro invasion? Well, I may not be too high up on the BGG history, but I see now why it's so popular. Simple gameplay-- it passed the girlfriend/brother test. I figured it to be a little boring... just laying tiles? Then I saw the glory of euro games ;)

I get the draw to this game, as laying the tiles down and building a town at random is really neat!  At two players however, I've never really felt too much tension in the gameplay.  Still, it's quick and fun, and the decisions that are there are fine for what it is.

This is a great alternative to Catan. I like that the tile drawing changes the board eveytime you play and that you're never really out of the race. Placement is huge so there is definitely some strategy involved too. It's a pretty laidback game but you still get the sense that their is something to be won!

My first German game. I realize now that this game is merely okay, but when I first played it I was blown away. I still think it's a good game for the family, or to get nongamers to dip their feet into the pool. Other than that, it generally collects dust on the shelf.

Great 2-3 player game. Simple and fun, and playable in about 30 minutes if everyone knows that they're doing.  I'm a big fan, and I doubt this game will ever leave my collection.

Note: Always play that as soon as you lay down a tile, you pick the next one up. That way you can think of your move as the other people are placing theirs. Speeds up the game. Two knowledgeable players can knock out a game in 20 minutes.

Oh, another great thing about this game: amazing quick set-up and cleanup time.  You normally only get this kind of speed with a card game. (Although, drawing tiles from a stack and cards from a deck are kinda similar...)

RATING: 7
To me, Carcassonne is the definition of a 7: a good, solid game, thank you very much.  Little to criticize, little to brag about.  The game plays well with any number, and isn't even bad as solitaire.  Still, there can be a somewhat mechanical feel to it, as there's usually an optimal place for each drawn tile.

Carcassonne is *THE GAME* that did it for me -- the one that got me permanently hooked on the world of European board games that I had never known existed before. The game that opened my eyes to the whole world of fun out there that I was missing out on. I think anyone who has played this game would immediately place it at the very top of their all-time favorite list, but it's relatively low ranking on BoardGameGeek (it's currently #46) has probably more to due with its age than anything else, since it's a 7-year old game as of this writing. In any case, this game is an all-out classic, and is considered a "gateway game" for anyone looking to dip their toes into the "alternative" world of gaming. EXCELLENT & OUTSTANDING.

Solid game, and I can see why it's one of the bigger hits. The tile laying aspect means that you'll end up with a different board every time, and the rules allow you to play pretty much separately with newbies, but to get more cutthroat with more experienced players. There is an element of luck with what tiles you'll get, and I've seen people draw 4 roads in a row with a lot of frustration. Still, the game is quite fun, especially with some expansions.

A classic. My girlfriend and I played many, many, many games of this early in our relationship when I was just introducing her to the hobby. I think scoring can be unwieldly at times (stupid farms!) but I will always agree to play this when it is suggested.

It's rare to find a game that you can play casually/socially and seriously competitively without either version feeling compromised in some way.  This is one of the very few.

Really love this game with 2 players. I don't think I've played with 3, and with 4-5 it seems a bit too random to me, at least without expansions (since there are only ~80 tiles, you get to place 40 in a 2 player game and only 15-20 in a 4-5 player game, which definitely detracts from the strategy a bit). Very tactical two player game though.

Update: now we have the Inns & Cathedrals and Traders & Builders expansions, and it does add a lot to the game. With 2 players I'm fine playing without those two expansions, but I think with more players they add a lot more depth to the game (and mitigate the randomness)

Everything good about this game is true. Both good and bad. A great gateway game, but gets stale after awhile and is terribly random with more than 3 or 4 players. Probably should be in everyone's collection.

This game is not terrible, but it doesn't live up to the hype. Mostly my complaint is with the Farmer scoring. A secondary problem I have with it is the down time, and the 'everyone telling you where to put your piece', which some people seem to actually like. As a variant I'd probably try a 'draw as soon as you've played' rule so you can look at most of your options before it gets to your turn. It might be nice to have more than 1 tile to play as well, maybe a hand of 3 or something for more strategy (though that's not really what the game is lacking).

First time I played Carcassonne, I really didn't like it. Then I started playing some of the variants of it and warmed up to it. The base game, however, is still just too plain, though. The only way to even the playing field is through subterfuge. And then when everyone's using subterfuge, it all boils down to luck.

I'm much happier with The Castle or The City, because of all the distractions. They give the game some much-needed flexibility.

One of the first games I bought after becoming enamored with eurogames.  Like many other folks, I find the random tile draw to be somewhat annoying, though it's not usually a problem.

2-5 player tile-laying family game, but any game above 3 players isn't much fun. The game is cute and probably innovative for its time, but doesn't seem very fun to me. The epitome of "manufacturing victory points", this game just feels like work and no fun.  

Annoying thing about the game is people can "game" you by memorizing the tiles, and I'm never sure how well I'm doing in the game - the scores fluctuate a lot from game to game.

This was a staple for a long time.
With all the tiles in the mix, the game gets very long, especially with more than 2 players.  
We have played 'timed' games and tile limited games to shorten the time it takes to play.  
It is often a misunderstood game.  There is never a 'perfect' or 'optimal' place to put a tile.  Usually you can play the tile defensively or offensively.  Too much offense and your opponent becomes offensive forcing you to become more defensive.  Politics and attitude go a long way in this game.

2012 early Christmas for Zack from Julia

This along with Stone Age is my wife's favorite multiplayer family strategy game to play together that takes 45-60 minutes to play.  She eagerly awaits to play future expansions after she was impressed with the challenge brought about by Inns and Cathedrals added with Traders and Builders (which are must-buy expansions in our opinion if one wants an optimal Carcassonne experience).  The components are classic in their wooden colorful "meeple" aesthetic that has defined what Euro games look and feel like compared to mass-market American games.  I think we actually enjoy this game more than we had enjoyed Settlers of Catan (the game that brought us into the tabletop gaming hobby).  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This is a game I appreciate much more than I enjoy. It would see more playtime if I owned less games, but isn't a favorite of anyone's in our group and rarely comes out because of it.

Very fun game that I will always remember fondly as getting me into the hobby. Easy rules, beautiful pieces, AND meeples! Friends have a variant where you have a hand of 3 tiles to give you a little more control which helps, but the game still often comes down to who drew the most cloisters. The farmer scoring could have been implemented in an easier fashion, possibly.

RATING: 6.5
A game that I have seen in shops a lot of times, but never really read anything about. I always thought it looked boring, but that just proves how wrong you can be.

I really enjoy this game. I enjoy the randomness mixed with some light strategy/tactics and I enjoy the mood that gets going when I have played this game in different groups. 

A pretty short and sweet light-hearted strategy game that I think will hit the table quite a lot the coming months!

I've played this one a lot more than is logged on here.  Another gateway game that has a lot of appeal and a fun strategic element that incorporates blocking and resource (in this case meeples) management.  Do you want to take a chance that this town might not get completed?  Should I fight the other player for control of this farm?  Fun game that's quick and easy to teach.

Engenhoso e bem feito. Facil de aprender e ensinar. Envolve estratégias e táticas variadas. A contagem é fácil. O jogo é bastante equilibrado. Todas as partidas acabaram com uma mínima diferença de pontos entre os jogadores. Bom tanto em dois quanto em três jogadores. Tambem funcionou em cinco, mas fica dificil sustentar as estratégias. -1 por conta da sorte que ainda acaba determinando a vitória.

This game fits as a metaphor for life. You get the pieces chance offers you and try to fit them in the right way. You have the workers representing your attention and investment labor, decisions based on prudence, prevision and consideration capacity.
Would like to see a metaphor for life not so based on Ego though...
Maybe a co-op spin-off objecting the building of a better or more beautiful common board.

Carcassonne is one of those rare games that has plenty in it to keep the adults entertained and yet the mechanics are simple enough that even young ones can have a go.

RATING: 7
A light fun gateway game.  We don't end up playing this one very often, because its too light and my wife always ends up getting lucky and getting all of the pieces she needs to win.  However, with all of the expansions we have it does make for a nice light game to mix-in every once in awhile.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A simple game with a tame theme. But don't let this fool you. This is a very, very nasty game with some folks. Blocking and denying are frequent, and the random element just make it more hilarious, wild, and fun.

2-games-in-1. When played with 2 becomes a ferocious, brain burning cutthroat action. When played with more, becomes a hilarious party/family game.

I'm lucky enough to procure one with The River expansion these days!

I bought the "Big box" to give as a gift but could not think of anyone deserving so I kept it. Carcassonne just is a light game that has been tweaked nicely by the expansions. My only misgiving is that I have "Hunters and Gatheres" and that just seems to more concisely do what Carcassonne and a couple of expansions attempts to do. Nevertheless the ability to mix and match expansions opens a variance in the gameplay that can only make Carcassonne more challenging and worthy of bringing to the table more often.

Potentially nasty family friendly euro that can easily be taught to players of tradition card games. No real theme, but looks cute enough, has a charm of seeing the board getting built. Easily taught, just use the farmer rules from latest edition - I had no problems with them (complicated? jeeze...).
Scales interestingly = more players make more chaos, less players make the game more thinky. Use the house rule to draw tiles at the end of your turn, not beginning - makes game flow smoother.

This is a go to game in our family. My almost 8 yr old wants to play it all the time. I also play on my phone as I unwind at the end of the evening.  Most other people seems to enjoy the game as well, except for my wife.  She prefers games with one or more endgame goals that she can set a strategy to work towards the goals on each turn.  This game has no such endgame goal; it is light on strategy and heavy on tactics which is why I think she does not enjoy it as much. My son has more difficulty executing long term strategy so this game lets him rack up points from a series of good short term decisions. I enjoy both types of games so I enjoy Carcassonne for what it is, a great tactical game.

A real classic, and it's portable too! I must've played hundreds of games against the AI using the Inns & Cathedrals and Traders & Builders expansions.

What I find interesting about Carcassonne is how the nature of the game changes depending on the player count. With 2P it is more calculative, especially when playing with those who have memorised the tile compositions (not something I'd plan to do again any time soon, but it is an enlightening experience). With more players added, it becomes more like a party game, since players are prone to negotiate the sharing of certain features.

I've had a lot of success using Carcassonne as non-gamer's game because it's simple and the gameplay is as gentle as the players want it to be.

Laying tiles to build the cities and roads is suprisingly theraputic.  Maybe this appeals to my hidden inner urban planner or something.  The base game is a bit simplistic, but with the Inns & Cathedrals and Traders & Builders expansions this becomes a great game.

 Children can play it readily at a young age and soon become apt at knowing what tiles are to come!

This is such a versatile game,easy to learn,a lot of interaction (the rules encourage this) and also rich in strategy. 

People consider it a light tile laying game and play it once and move along to other games without enjoying the simplicity of the Classic that is Carcassonne.

30+ plays. A pleasant and fun game system that 5 years ago, was one of the best gateway games for new gamers. (Ticket to Ride is now a better choice for that role.) Still, this is a fine mix between a "German" game and a casual time doing a jigsaw puzzle with family and friends. If you are buying your first game of this type, then I'd recommend Carc: Hunters and Gatherers over this original version as a better version with more intuitive rules and scoring.

Pretty much a perfect two player game for us (and has been very fun the couple of times that we have expanded the player count). It has the perfect mix of randomness and skill to make you feel like you did things right when you won but also not really feel like you get screwed too hard when you lose. It's pretty much the only "cutthroat" game that we own and there is a perfect amount of indignation and anger when someone swoops in to steal a city or road you have been working on for the last half of the game.

Seemingly simple tile laying game, scoring areas of the map that's being built by placing "meeples".  After several games and thinking I had the basics mastered, I played several games on BSW and was trounced soundly and completely.  Certainly deeper strategy than first apparent and plenty of expansions to ensure a great deal of replayability.

Great version available on Xbox Live Arcade.  Great interface and AI opponents (or play vs. others in the same room or via Live).  Expansions supposedly coming.

Great version on iPhone.  Great interface, solitaire variant.  Expansions supposedly coming.

A great introductory game, but wonderful in its own right.  It is deceptively simple yet surprisingly deep.  However, only a few of the expansions (I&C, T&B) are really worthwhile.

A classic tile laying game, one of the best gateway games to hook your non-gamer friends into the hobby. The first expansion (inns + cathedrals) is necessary, it's an incomplete game without it. The second expansion adds a lot of depth and strategy but only bring it out if people are comfortable with the game. What I mean is, don't play without the expansion!

RATING: 8.2
I've played Carcassonne close to 20 times.  It plays very quickly, and I don't think there is quite as much luck as some think there is.  It's more about managing your farmers than hoping to draw that perfect piece which will complete an over-sized city.  There are many shrewd tactical choices to be made.  When you draw a tile which doesn't directly benefit you, think about using that piece to hinder your nearest competitor to the greatest effect.  Doing so will make the game seem far less luck-driven.  

I've never lost at Carcassonne.  I've tied for first twice.  Generally my play group with it has been the same two people.  They beat me their fair share in other games.  So, either I'm extremely lucky, or this game is indeed deep in its strategy and tactics, and the luck is minimal.  I believe the latter is true.

The expansions seem to over-complicate what is a nice, simple and fun tile placing game, accessible to a lot of people.  Still a favorite and some of those expansions add some nice touches.  Playing with 2 or 3, it is fast and tactical.  With a larger group there is the fun of negociating the placement of the tile.  With the right crowd in a noisy mood, this is very fun, even when you lose! It can be frustrating at times though - the luck of the draw factor.  As long as you enjoy the ride, that is OK.

Good tile-laying game. Very elegant but also - to me - slightly boring because of the theme and because of the possible analysis paralysis problem.

RATING: 7
Carcassone is a light, relaxing game. In Carc, players take turns placing a single tile which might depict a farm and a road, a city, or a cloister - or a combination of these. Then you have the option of placing a meeple on your tile (as a knight, bandit, monk, or farmer - depending upon whether you put him on a city, road, cloister, or farm); and then there's some scoring business. There is something very pleasurable about slowly building the French countryside with others, and the scoring mechanism is ingenious. Learning when to deploy farmers takes a bit of strategizing. Now don't get me wrong, there is real strategy at work here - Carc just "feels" kind of light to me. This makes it an ideal game for social play. Skill matters (some anyway), but you don't feel that you have to watch the play like a hawk to perform well. My rating for this game includes a slight variant we use: we add the river tiles in with the rest (as opposed to playing them all at the beginning or leaving them out) and then use them to "screw your neighbor." Try it! It adds a little bit of ruthlessness to the bucolic setting.

There was a time when I rated Carc higher, and I do think it is a great game. But I've now played it sooooo many times, it's become a little stale. For a strategic game, I find myself desiring something a lot meatier, with greater control.

The base game is pretty bland. You're really just placing tiles, and trying to sneak some meeples into other player's cities. The game is VERY luck based and is usually decided by a few lucky draws. Other expansions add more options and also "fun", but really makes counting points and checking who controls what very complex. BSW could do that for you, but of course player interaction is equal to 0 there. (As if Carcassonne had any to begin with...)

I really like this game.

CONS: not very confrontational with 2 players. The scoring track sucks - it only goes up to 50 by which time you flip your meeple on its back to signify 50+ and keep going around. Probably not a big deal with more than 2 players- thus less scoring but we find ourselves loosing track if we score big as then you gotta flip your meeple a different way...sigh.

PROS: well the pros far out weigh the cons.  EASY! game play, fun tile laying, opportunity to steal points (I like this :) Fast for those need to fill between games moments.  Good all rounder! Great for first timers!

UPDATE: if you find Carcassonne a bit unchallenging or a tad bit boring you HAVE TO get Traders and Builders extension- best buy ever. It turned my Carcassonne game hating partner into a believer (or is it follower?) :)

RATING: N/A
The first few games of Carcassonne that I played were with more than 2 players, and left me underwhelmed. I thought it's nowhere near as good as the remaining two of the popular trio: [thing=13]Settlers of Catan[/thing] and [thing=9209]Ticket to Ride[/thing].

It's when I started playing 2-player Carcassonne that I saw the real beauty of this game. Fast, engaging and potentially cutthroat - this is another excellent gateway to the hobby.

(The variant with 3 tiles in hand seems to be popular, but I've never felt the need for it. The game is strategic enough as it is for a 2-player game - keep it simple.)

This is a great game. Some of the expansions are better played with three or more. Some of the expansions can be played without the additional rules. I almost always play with at least one River expansion and often the GQ expansion as well. When trying a new expansion for the first time I tend to not add any other expansions. Currently my favorite game.

Quick and easy, but very fun!  Tile-drawing mechanic works nicely to limit too many options and AP, while still rewarding skilled and clever players with the worker-placement mechanic.  Creating unique "boards" throughout the games is always enjoyable.  Expansions: too many, too unevenly distributed, and often too irrelevant.  Only Inns & Cathedrals seems necessary, a couple of the others (notably Traders & Builders) are good additions.  Classic game; still holds up and is perfect for its weight.

9/17/14 7.5 - a good game, but i like it better with a full table, 5 or 6 players, but can only get about 1 or 2 others reliably.  i didn't realize how much of a screwage game this was until i played the phone app, and that really makes it fun - turns this library game into warfare!

3/20/16 - lowered rating to 6.  i enjoy the cutthroat aspect of the game and trying to do farmer wars.  but overall find it a little less exciting and not something i would ever ask to play.  i do like it as a gateway game.

Carcassonne is a classic at this point and deservedly so. For me, it's a very relaxing experience. It's one of those games that you can talk about your day while playing. We play it almost cooperatively, with everyone helping to find the best spot for a tile. It's like doing a puzzle, but with points. If I had a negative about the game, it's the farmer scoring. Points are usually pretty close, but it always seems that whoever lucks out with the better farmer placements wins. It's a small issue and doesn't deter me from bringing this game out when we just want to sit back and relax.

With "Inns & Cathedrals", "Abbey & Mayor" and "Builders & Traders" added, Carcassonne is pretty  much the perfect game. Easy to teach, hard to master. The expansions add length, but they also add satisfying depth. For a quick game, I keep a separate set of just the base game tiles.

Wow, this game really is not fun.  For some reason I kept getting suckered into playing this.  It looks cool and seems like it should be up my alley, but it reminds me of Trivial Pursuit.  You always want what the other people get and you get screwed when it comes to you.  Too random.  I will not play this again, ever!  Warning: Not broken on its own, needs the Morgan expansion to destroy all game playability.

I don't know what all the fuss about. Personally I find Carcassonne quite boring and a waste of good board game time. Simple to play with minimal strategy besides guessing remainder tiles and therefore best placement. Unless you have played this game many times and memorised each tile quantity - its really just random.

My brother bought this game in late 2003, and I can credit this for my renewed interest in all boardgames.  Prior to Carcassonne, I was occasionally playing Risk 2210 with friends, and some Magic: the Gathering online.  After Carcassonne, I came to BGG looking for strategy and I was hooked.

I'm now not as big of a fan of Carcassonne as I was when I first played it, and I prefer Hunters and Gatherers over the original, but it is still a remarkably good game, and a worthwhile addition to most players' game closets.

Certainly a great game. There's some variety of strategies to use -- our 7-year old plays without peasants, while my wife and me always end up in the peasant war, and sometimes we almost tie up, the three of us. I also found out though that the peasant wars are only important on big games -- we have some three or four extensions, and it only makes sense to fight for land and towns on a field with 200  tiles. We never could figure out the princess, but the dragon brings a lot of tension to the game that otherwise might have just ended up in the first third of the bag of tiles.

This is a good game.  I give it a lower rating because of the end-game mechanics with respect to fields.  It seems contrarian to the entire initial purpose of building cities that, at the end, fields in fact are what matter most.  I confess I might have been taught the game wrongly.

All that being said, it is a generally entertaining game.

The standard edition of Carcassone with the expansions is falling out of favor with my gaming group. The City is more advanced and contained, making for a neater game. I think that the manufacturers over-extended themselves on the brand and tried for the easy $ while the market was hot. Still a fun game and definitely worth the price. But would recommend H&G over this at the $20 price point. If you want to spend a little bit more, for $50 you can get the City which is superbly constructed and more strategic IMO.

Fun little tile laying game that is more like meditation to me than an engrossing game. If one could produce the perfect word about the experience of playing Carcassonne, I would say "pleasant." Thats not bad, mind you, and I do love to spring this one on non-gamers, who seem to enjoy it much. Fact is, I believe there is a little known chemical in the brain called Carcassonnine that gets released only when one begins to place these cute little tiles one after the other down on the table. The Carcasonnine induces a state of hypnotic euphoria, feelings of fuzy warmness, and above all, pleasantness.

Easy to play.  Tons of replay value.  Each time you play it is something different.  Adding the Dragon and Fairy expansion is a MUST.  Definitely a game changer.  Consider buying multiple Base Sets (72 tiles) to make the game last longer.  Paint the extra Meeples different colors and increase the number of players.  I have over 700 base tiles and play with 3 different colored Dragons -- adds a lot to the game.  But then again, playing with the original 72 tiles and no Dragons is still fun.  smb

The game that got me back into boardgaming! I played this so many times and I enjoyed every single one of them. I no longer play it as often as I used to, as my gaming tastes moved on to heavier games, but this is still a lot of fun when I do. I love seeing the board grow differently every time. I love how you can play this more or less agressive.
Nowadays I'd rather play with just the base game and the Inns & Cathedrals expansion. Over time I collected quite a number of expansions, but it quickly gets bloated to a point where t's no longer a quick, lighter type game.

Owned expansions: Inns & Cathedrals / Traders & Builders / King & Scout / The River 1 & II / The Cult / The Tower

Really great gateway game and a nice way to draw in all sorts of new gamers, whether they be kids or adults. The nice thing is that with some good expansions, this can become a strategic and deep game. In my opinion, playing with the King, Inns and Cathedrals, and Traders and Builders expansions together makes for a killer, deep game, and one that with some investment, even novice gamers can become familiar with the additional pieces. My rating, therefore, is based on having some expansions, and the Big Box is highly recommended as a purchase.

An elegant and uncomplicated tile-laying game that I find is both intellectually stimulating and a pleasure to play.  While I initially thought it was quite good, I've found that it has grown on me over time (have increased my rating from 6.5 to 7.75).  Some genuine strategy involved, although random tile drawing can reduce the success of this.  I prefer a smaller number of players than some, as I then find it quite relaxing as well as thoughtful.  Recommended.

With Carcassonne now on the iPad/iPhone, I've renewed my love of the classic title. The base game with two players is exceptionally good and more challenging than I had previously thought. The beauty of Carcassonne, of course, lies with the mixing and matching of expansions in order to upscale the game and keep it fresh.

Clever tile placement game, very good fun and good for introducing people to board games. Suffers from fields being too strong and not enough variance in the base game (Making me lean towards voluspa in tile-laying love)

Carcassonne is a good game, and one that I enjoy.  I bought Hunters & Gatherers instead, as I feel it's better as a standalone game, but with expansions it's a much more difficult choice.  If I were willing to spend more money on Carcassonne, I might have gone the other way.

Good classic game.  I don't think there is anything wrong with it, but somehow I am less interested in Carcassone any more.  I love playing it, but would not think of suggesting it actually.  Maybe too classic now?  I don't know, I probably just played it too often. :)

A pretty famous game and it's fairly clear why. Incredibly simple rules, visually appealing game area with infinite replayability and of course expansions if you're into that sort of thing. Great to sit down and play a quick game but I wouldn't choose it as the centrepiece of a heavy strategic gaming evening. For me, it sits nicely into a slot of time when you haven't got a couple of hours for a longer game.

Many call this a gateway game, but I feel it's too complex for someone's first modern board game, especially with the confusing farmer scoring.  Once someone has played a few modern games, they will be OK with this.  I like it, and I find you can be quite clever with meeple placement.  I do prefer to play where everyone draws at the end of their turn so they can plan.

Fun tile-laying game -- the one that made the genre popular! But it's been around a while, and rating has fallen slightly - prefer the variants to the original, now. 

Tiles show some combination of land/city/road +/- cloister. Place starting tile in center. In turn order, draw then play a tile adjacent to one already on the board, until last tile placed. When placing, features on edges must match adjacent tile. MAY place a meeple on a feature of the tile you placed, but only if no other meeple is already present on that type of feature on another tile, where the features are contiguous. If your tile placement completes the feature, score it immediately (city: 2 per tile; shields count as extra tile; road: 1 per tile; cloister: 9 when completely surrounded). At end of game, each farm (contiguous cluster of land) scores 3VP/city to the player with meeple majority in the farm. Most VP wins.

Like it, don't love it -- when I play it, it's more to pass the time and have something to chat over than to actually play a game.  Having said that, as light games go Carcassonne is one of the best.  I'd rather go with something slightly weightier, like Alhambra, but if Carcassonne gets suggested I'm typically happy to play.  Still, Carcassonne is my game of choice for getting reluctant non-gamers into gaming.  Works every time!

RATING: 3
I keep wanting to like this one, but I seem to enjoy it less every time I play.  It is a well-designed game that can be enjoyed by children and adults, but I don&#039;t usually like these type of free-form tile-laying games, especially where you&#039;re drawing one random card that you have to play.  I can see why most people like it.  Just my own personal quirks coming into play here for the most part.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I just don't get it.  I've only played the base game without any expansions but it's just boring to me.  The drawing of tiles is completely random and I get that there is strategy involved in shaping your roads and cities and meeple placement against this but that's not enough to keep me interested.

After playing this game several more times in an attempt to give it a fair shake I think I like it even less.  I really don't get the love for this game!

2 players is the maximum you can play this with any semblance of strategy and still sometimes you will never see the tiles you need while your opponent gets the perfect one every turn.  With more than 2 it is just nonsense.  The chances of you getting usable tiles that fit your strategy is diluted even further with every additional player and the number of tiles placed that screw with your whole plan is increased.  Every tile you place you have no idea if it is going to help you or just end up being a waste of a turn.  I'm ultimately convinced this is not a very good game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I'm giving this game a second chance.  Never did much for me but now that my girls are older this suddenly became more interesting.  I think the base game is a solid game but not great.  I'd like to try the traders and builders expansion to get more out of this.

Just great. Carcassonne is one of these games that I just can't say no to play. Sometimes you don't feel in the mood of thinking too much, to play Puerto Rico, Euphrat, or one of these a bit more complicated games... but Carcassonne is so easy that I'm always willing to play. As well, so far I've all the expansions for it and it gains a lot of gameplay and variations. I'll say that the basic game itself is maybe too simple, so if you can, play it at least with the river expansion.
Completely recommended to everyone, no matter the age.

Probably my favorite game, it still doesn't feel old to me. The mix of puzzle playing, planing, luck, messing with the opponent and strategy is just extremely appealing to me.
The thing is, no other game has held its attraction with me like Carcassonne, with others my liking usually goes up and down a bit but this one I can always play.
It holds up very well with any number of players, it plays different with 2 than with 5 but is good fun in any variant.

Very easy to learn and fun to play. The scoring for farmers is overly complicated, however. I actually prefer other versions of Carc such as Ark of the Covenant.

Update: this game is getting played more thanks to the XBLA version. No set up / clean up, and the game enforces the rules for you!

Game that got me into all this (thanks methsdrinker!) - great stuff - easy to learn, and easy to get others involved, inc. non-gamers. 

With slightly modded rules, have even played with my 3-year old, and not a single meeple casualty (so far).

Often use "The River II" (for an uber-river - by the way, Meeples can't swim...though they do float) & 12 central tiles from "The Count of Carc" (but not the count himself) to add starting set-up variety - Inns & Cathedrals are pretty much always in there too, except when playing with the wee one - too long otherwise!

Interesting solo variant described on the geek too.

EDIT: Comments from Jan 2010 above; now 3 years later I'm still enjoying this, particularly on the ipod and with Emma, including Inns and Cathedrals, but not counting fields, and she's good!

"I shall never, ever have a profile on Boardgamegeek. That is for husbands to have, and for husbands alone", says she.

"Put the games on your profile", says my loving wife.

Ironically I didn't really enjoy playing this game on a board, however when it came out on the Xbox Arcade on Marketplace I LOVED it.

Played a few times, and I really enjoy playing it. My only gripe is that it's relatively low tension as your opponents' strategies are simultaneously clear and yet also entirely unknown as it depends on which tile they play next.

RATING: 8
Easy to teach and popular with non-gamers and gamers alike. I enjoy puzzling out the best place for a tile. With gamers, you can play dirty, blocking each other's castles off, or sneaking in to share or steal the points. I prefer with 2-3 players only, but will occasionally play up to 6 with non-gamers.

When teaching new players, I'll add to the basic rules the big guy, inn on the lake, & cathedrals only. I leave the traders and builder to another day.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice game that we always play with the expansions Inns & Cathedrals and Traders & Builders. We played it a lot as it was one of our first games, but now we have much better games and it only gets played when we have people visiting that want to play a light, easy to explain game. My father-in-law doesn't really like games, but likes Carcassone.
EDIT May 2015: We played it for the first time with our daughter without the farmer rule.
EDIT April 2016: First game with full rules with our daughter with the 2 expansions.

For a gateway game, it has some confusing rules. I played this more than a 100 times in the first two years after its release, but only a dozen times after that. Is suffers severely from expansionitis and clearly jumped the shark with the Dragon expansion. The second expansion is actually pretty good, I wouldn't want to play without it. But still, I prefer Hunters & Gatherers and The Castle over this.

Great game. Clean and clear gameplay, interesting choices, with a just a little player interaction to be great fun. Played well with 2 player and scaled great into 5 player. 

Best selling point: Add more expansions to increase depth or add an additional base game to increase play time. Great selling point for me, makes it great to scout for in used stores/garage sales.

RATING: 7
Classic, simple, fun.  I only have the base game + the river and bishops, but it's just such a pleasure to get this game to the table.  Whether I'm in the mood for a tight 2-player game or a 5-player free-for-all, this game is never too long and never too dull.  I never want it more than twice an evening, though, so it's good for a quick appetizer but not a main course.

RATING: 7
The first time I played this, I didn't get it. Maybe because I didn't understand the rules. Maybe because I was expecting more from it, after having played Settlers of Catan non-stop for a while. I gave it another go and lo and behold, we've got ourselves a pretty nifty game. I really like this game but it simply doesn't see the table as often as many others, maybe because I've outgrown it... Still, it's historically relevant in boardgaming history and a classic. After Catan it's considered a sales reference and an unequivocal gateway game. So I can see myself playing this to introduce people to board gaming, or occasionally, simply to remind myself that it's a fun game to play.

Meh.  I play mostly 2 player games with my boyfriend, and we played this when we were relatively new to gaming.  This game shows up on all of the lists recommending games for newbie players/couples to start out with, but I'm really glad this wasn't the first game we got because I don't know if we would have continued.  It was "fine" but decidedly underwhelming.  We got the Inns & Cathedrals expansion and also tried some house rules (drawing more tiles for example) -- that helped, but the game just had no tension.  Maybe if we knew the tiles better and could predict which tiles would come up and then try to plan out our moves... but if we were going to do that, I'd rather play a heavier game with more to it.  I can say that I enjoy the iPad version much more -- moves way quicker and it's helpful to see where you can/can't move.  Also, we didn't find the scoring that complicated as some people did, so that didn't scare us off.  I get that the board is nice looking, but there's no sense of having accomplished anything at the end -- you have no idea looking at the board at the end which of the cities/roads are yours, and which are your opponents.  Really just quite boring.  We traded it away.

Tile laying, area control game that is low to medium strategy, but experienced players have a significant advantage in knowing where to score the most points.  Part of the challenge is that the drawing of tiles is random, so it is difficult to plan ahead for optimal advantage.  I have yet to try the game with a tile auction (like Tikal) but would be interested to see if this changes things.

Poor Carc!  This was the first eurogame I bought, back in 2003.  I made the mistake of opening the box and reading the rules to my wife and her family, watching eyes glaze over at the farmer rules.  The first game went abysmally, and poor Carc was shunned for several years, finally experiencing a 2p resurgence in the form of the iOS app.  Will have to see if this new experience improves the rating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good tile laying game. A little bit thin of gameplay, so not my personal favorite, however, it works very well in certain situations. For instance, it works very well with my father who has memory problems. He only has to make one decision at a time--"where do I put this tile?"
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Easy to learn, quick to play.  Just as fun for 2 as for 5.  Excellent "bridge" game to teach non-gamers.

After being in our collection for years now, I would never suggest this game.  However, I also wouldn't turn it down as it's quick and easy.  For introduction games we now prefer Ticket to Ride.

Carcassonne is the first of the collection and it brings the whole new experience of modern board games to me. I like that the situation of the game can be changed all the time while playing. It keeps me thinking the best way to manage tiles and turns and teaches me to plan ahead before everything forms into shape. The game also slightly reveals true personality of each player which is the true fun of the game and is the reason why I got hooked to it. Highly recommended to both beginners and regulars.

+ easy to learn and to teach 
+ great tile laying gameplay that never plays the same twice
+ accessible to new players, but still engaging to more advanced players
+ cutthroat 2 player game

:thumbsdown: DISLIKE
- some luck tied to the tile drawing but you can play with the 3 tiles in hand variant to alleviate that
- farmer scoring is a bit opaque to new gamer

:star: VERDICT
Fast, fun and simple.  It's a classic.  My rating is for the cutthroat 2 player game (3+ being a little too chaotic).  
If you get bored with it, there is tons of expansions (most of them not too good though) to renew the game.

Ah, Carc!  You were one of The Originals that started my wife and I gaming together.  It's hard to remember any more what the original game without the expansions was like, although it was certainly a fine little game in its own right.  I have carefully chosen which expansions I have purchased [edit: I have thrown caution to the wind and now own most of the expansions, which has pretty much destroyed the game by drastically increasing the amount of time required to play] and every one of those expansions has added an interesting element to the game.  When playing with all the expansions I own (The River, The River II, Inns and Cathedrals, Traders and Builders, King and Scout, The Princess and The Dragon), and with about half the tiles in the bag to decrease the play time, I would rank this game 7.5/10.  With my wife as my most frequent gaming partner, this has been one of the most played games we own (although it was one of the first games we owned!).  [Edit: Well, we finally killed poor Carc - http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/27391 - so we traded it away and purchased "Carcassonne: The City".  Game design: 3/5  Personal enjoyment: 2/5  Total: 5/10

Simple to understand. Simple to play. Pleasant "little" game, but somehow I never want to play. There is really not that much to think about (except some probabilities), and unnatural moves. The game as such is not very logical and nothing feels natural about it.

When it is not your turn there is practically nothing to think about.

Formally I like it, but I just don't want to play it... :)


Also a good family game.

I have been having this game for years. I still like to play it occasionally. The game itself is awesome — true work of a genius, a design that happens once in century. Due to numerous expansions, and endless tweaks of the rules the game is a bit rough in some aspects and with too many expansions tend to drag, so the more the tiles, the lower the rating. But I'm adjusting rating for basic game and raising it, because core set is excellent. I think I'd like to see only some rules from expansion sets, pawns and tiles in a single Designer’s Cut Set… ;)

The game has a nice art and well-intentioned game play ideas.

For my own taste there is too much randomness / luck regarding the tiles you draw in a sequence. You may end up pulling only = [i]always[/i] stuff you wouldn't need.
Secondly I find the downtime in this game to be horrible.... Way too much watching at people, who are watching at tiles.

[many plays] I have played the Hunters and Gatherers version before this original version.  Really I like them both about the same.  I guess I have a slight preference for the theme in Hunters and Gatherers plus I like the gold nugget bonus card mechanic.  The advantage this has over Hunters and Gatherers though is the expansions.  Really this series is a fun series.  It if fun for hardcore gamers and it is fun for non-gamers, it kind of hits that sweet spot right in the middle.

[RGG Carcassonne Big box 2006 edition] {City building, gateway; tile-laying; optimal 3-4p} Carcassonne is a very good family game. It's easy to learn and interactive. Scoring happens all the time, which allows player to visual scores more easily, although it slightly disrupts the game flow. In addition, it's fun to play Carcassonne. Highly recommended as a gateway game in any collection.

It's more forgiving than Hunters & Gatherers, where incomplete roads and cities can still score.  It has good player interaction with mild confrontation. In addition, it is dynamic because tiles can be merged together and there are bonus tiles so that the situation may change abruptly.  

The Big Box edition is real good. It saves space and has a good insert for all tiles. In addition, it has a reference sheet for the distribution of tiles in the basic game and all expansions.

[Rulebook] The annotated rulebook in BGG shall be used with RGG Big Box edition. This rulebook provides the latest rules and FAQs, which makes the rules it much clearer.  I prefer the scoring rule of 3rd edition.

Good game to play with non-gamers, but I'd rather play something meatier if given the choice.

Last played: May 2008

RATING: 7
I will probably rank it higher, when I find the right combination of expansions.

My main gripe with this game is that it can be very mean for a family game. When I introduce it to new (usually boardgame novices) I have to hold my punches and refrain from taking over their roads and castles. And I don't like holding punches.

Carcassonne recently shot up to become one of my favorite games after a bunch of one-on-one plays with my partner.  This is a simply fantastic game; simple and fairly easy to teach, friendly-looking and colorful, but rewarding of a lot of thought and downright cut-throat when it comes down to it.  My partner even introduced it to my parents-in-law, and now they have their own copy that they play regularly, too!  A beautiful and elegant game.  I enjoy it most two-player, since it tends to take a bit longer with more players (only because people think harder about their turns and aren't able to plan ahead as much), but fun no matter what.  I honestly don't see getting too many expansions, I think they'd ruin the nice simple-but-difficult feel the game currently has.

Non è solo il nome di una città della Francia meridionale. È diventato il simbolo della lotta all'eresia condotta dalla chiesa medievale. La cittadella fortificata, unica nel suo genere, è circondata da un paesaggio molto bello e intricato. I giocatori piazzano le tessere che contengono gli elementi del paesaggio (città, monasteri, strade e campi) ampliandolo ad ogni turno. Con i propri seguaci (cavalieri, monaci, ladri e contadini) i giocatori cercano di estendere definitivamente la propria influenza sulle singole aree e in questo modo ottengono punti vittoria. Bravo il giocatore che riesce a conservare i propri seguaci per le fasi più calde della partita... 
CARCASSONNE - Un gioco di strategia semplice e duraturo, assicura sfide nuove ad ogni partita.

Contenuti:
72 Tessere Paesaggio
40 Seguaci in legno

Relaxing and thought-provoking. The board game equivalent of a walk on the beach. 

UPDATE: The more I play this, the more I love it. It is so simple but so deep. Im really starting to see the different strategies the game offers. Moves up to a 9. Quickly becoming my 2nd favorite (after Railways of the World).

UPDATE 2: After playing this a bunch over the Holidays and adding I&C, I must say, it has surpassed TtR as my 2nd favorite game.

Carcassonne is a joy to play, easy to learn and teach, and fun enough to hold my 6-year old's flighty attention. It also allows for strategy and every game is different, adding to the replayability. Creating a different board every game is nice too! It's been around for quite sometime and highly regarded as one of the best modern board games. You can't go wrong with choosing Carcassonne.

Really well designed game which can make for a tense competition between 2, 3 or 4 equally matched players. More tends to get too chaotic. Note, an experienced player will usually have a massive advantage over a newbie due to knowledge of the tile set, which doesn't make this an ideal gateway game as unmatched games tend to be a very one-sided affair.

I like this game for all the reasons everyone else seems to. Its quick to learn and teach and there is no set up time. I have taken this to the school I teach in and it is great for a lunch time - you can start them off and within 5 minutes they are underway with only a few pointers or reminders. My own kids who are 7 and 10 like the fun of building the landscape itself, irespective of how it helps them win the game. I like the depth to the various strategies, the way people try to convince each other of where they should lay their tiles; mini alliences often break out between players and the fact that the winner can often be a suprise.

As a gateway game, this game takes the cake over Settlers of Catan anyday.  I enjoy the amount of strategy you can put into this game in relation to the amount of rules.  My group commonly plays this game to fill the time while we wait for other arrivals, so it's good even past the gateway point.

I own Inns & Cathedrals.

On Inns & Cathedrals: Adds good additions to the game, but not enough to really make the gameplay radically different, which is good and bad.  I do always play with this expanison.

One of my wife's favorite games.  I am not a big fan of it (unless my 5 year old daughter picks it because I would rather play Carcassonne than Candy Land again) so my wife mostly plays with her friends at a meet up while my son and I try to introduce some quality Ameritrash games to our primarily Euro Style meet up group.

It is a great game for anyone new to the hobby though.

Update:  Been playing this a lot lately with my 5 year old.  The game is growing on me and I like watching her thinking evolve.  We included this game in the 10X10 challenge and we finished this game in March or April.

The fun easy-learn standard by which other tile-laying games are either improved upon, or denied a worthy BGG ranking.

A tile laying game. Very fun, light, and easy. A mix of worker placement and area control. It gains extra depth after a few plays, and can be a tight exercise in risk management if played with an experienced group.

[u]Key Words:[/u] Tile Placement - Area Control - Gateway - 2-5 Players - 45mins

[u]Summarized Opinion:[/u] Good, simple game. The lukewarm rating is primarily because it's lost its interest for me and nowadays I only play if I'm not up to something heavier (which happens only rarely). As a gateway, this game is easily a 9.

[u]My Rating Explained:[/u] Ok game, will play sporadically if in the right mood.

[u]Verbose Assessment:[/u]

This light tile placement game is great for beginning or casual gamers. It offers manageable options each turn and is easy to explain, while still interesting enough even for more experienced gamers. The game takes under an hour to play and down-time is minimal.

Expansions can be added to add a little more options to the game if so desired. Just be careful which you choose, they're not all good.

Fantastic as a gateway. Only ok if you're into heavier fare.

As of 10/06/07, this is still my favorite game and the only one I rate a 10.  Its just perfect, IMHO.

EDIT - As of February 13, 2008, I have another 10.  But this is still my all-time favorite.

EDIT - As of March 8, 2008, Carc has been replaced as my favorite game by Scripts and Scribes.  Its been a great run, but S&S just offers deeper gameplay with less luck.

EDIT - On July 14, 2010, the unthinkable happened.  I dropped Carc down to a 9.  I still thinks it's brilliant, but I really have no desire to play it anymore.

Can't remember which was my first Euro - this or Settlers. Just know I spent a lot of time playing these two and not much else for some reason. Very elegant little game, but obviously has a lot more competition now, so hasn't been played in a while. Needs at least the Inns & Cathedrals expansion, and I think the Traders & Builders is a good addition too. Everything after that is just overcomplicating a game that shouldn't be complicated.

At first it seems like a moderately entertaining, albeit hugely luck-driven game. Sadly, it doesn't take many plays to realise that this is nothing but an exercise in bullying, whining, whatever it take to manipulate the other players into helping you..there are far better diplomatic games available than this stinker. Avoid.

yet another game from the "you must own this game" series. i'm so impressionable. i'll rate it after i play it a few times.
Played it several times now. I really like this game, not because it has great mechanics and causes me to agonize over decisions, although I like that in a game. The reason I like this game is because it's fun and easy. I can play it with anyone I know and everyone enjoys it. It scales excellent from two players up, though a two player game is a little different than three or more it's just as fun and challenging. IF we have trouble deciding which game we should play out of the few I own, Carcassonne will usually be played first. See the PC version at www.carcassonne-online.com

It's a classic. One of the best games ever constructed. It should be in everyones collection. You can teach your mum and dad the rules, as well as your six year old child. You can play it in an hour or so. And it's fun. Not much else to say, really. (Somewhere we picked up "The River" expansion. Either it was included in this version of the base game, or it came together with one of the first expansions. I don't remember. It is nice to use when there are four or more players)

A classic.  Lots of fun, short game time and easy to learn.  Probably gets to the table more than any other game I have as a result.

two plays so far (yeah, I'm way behind the gaming curve on this one, but it's new to us). We're really enjoying the modular board - different mechanic that I had never tried before this game.

Update: finally added in two expansions on our third game (first recorded play), and very much enjoyed them both. Will not play without them in the future.

Update 2012: has not held up for me. Okay to play if in the right mood with non-gamers, but otherwise has become a dull experience with too few interesting decisions that is also too long for what it is.

After Catan - this was my next 'Euro'.  So simple to teach and play.  Only have the base game at the moment, but mostly play with other people's copies with the I&C and T&B expansions.  I also enjoy the variant where each player has a hand of 5 tiles to choose from - in my view this speeds up the game and allows for some longer term strategy, lowering the luck factor slightly.

EDIT Sep-2011:  Nowadays I have the I&C, T&B and BC&C expansions.  Keen to get the other two main ones as well, P&D and A&M.

I've always played this as a friendly little tile placer, building a pretty landscape together and scoring some points along the way. From what I can tell, tho, that's not how you win. You win by kicking people out of the cities and fields they started by cleverly preparing and then merging tiles with your meeples on them into others territories. I never even tried that. Might be more fun?

A simple, enjoyable game with solid mechanics. A single game can be irresistible, but further rounds provide diminishing returns. Random element hurts the appeal for those looking for pure strategy as sometimes players can get terrible tile draws. Rule variants help to fix this issue and I imagine expansions will solidify Carcassonne's timelessness even more.

Very popular with some of our friends, but we actually prefer this when there's just the two of us as some people seem to dislike varying the rules from game to game.  

Over the years we've picked up most of the expansions and played it such a lot that we went off it a bit and started to keep it to play when other's insisted on it or to play with non-gamers.  However, we recently picked up the Winter edition to play over Christmas and have re-discovered the simplicity associated in the base game played with just two.

Simple, elegant, pretty easy to teach. You can play this aggressively (stealing cities and roads, battling for farms), or non-aggressively, depending on who you're playing with to tailor the experience accordingly and this is a game I expect to still be playing years from now.

I've not yet played any expansions and don't feel that they're needed. Maybe one day I'll burn out and feel the need to change it up a little (note: I have the River 1 expansion but rarely use it).

My wife and I love playing this game, and this is the game we played most to date!:) I like the interactivity that goes on during game play, and how it doesn't drag on for too long (though the expansion packs are now making the game considerably longer). It is a game which my wife is able to beat me, and therefore it continues to sustain her interest. ;)

*Three years down the road and after playing many more games, this game is hardly put on the table anymore. The thought of laying tiles seem tedious now as the novelty wears off...Nonetheless, it is a fascinating game for anyone new to boardgaming.*

A nice family game somewher between puzzle, ressource management (your meeples), chance calculation, luck-pushing, and "take that!" moments.
After having played with most of the expansions for ages, going back to just the base game was quite an experience. The base game on its own is much more cut-throat, as there are less tiles to fill "this certain gap" in your city... and as some combinations are not available at all, it's easier to block other players (and be blocked).

Rating for the Abbey expansion

You could instead of play a meeple, get back your abbey an score for a not completed monastery or garden tile (works like a monastery, but you could play only an abbey on a garden). So you have a decision.

I've played it a lot with my daughters (aged 5 and 6). Simple game mechanism, nice pictures on the tiles, moderated play length. Although you have little contorol over the final result, it is a nice light game.

It proved to be worth buying.

Great game, took a while before i invested in this and actually gave my first copy away, but only because I needed an excuse to buy the Big Box set.

Not a 10 as I will sometimes turn down a game as I've occasionally felt carced out and need a break.

I normally play with one large expansion mixed in but rarely with more than that. Quite often there is one or two smaller expansions with the river being a favourite

A classic, of course, and the ideal game to pull out of the cupboard when you tell someone you play board games and they say "What, like Monopoly?" Colourful, simple, with nice solid meeple bits. Gameplay is light, but nonetheless engaging enough. A game of long-term efficency, wherin the small decisions add up to a long-term victory or loss. Expansions add greater depth and gameplay considerations.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I have this rated at a 5 because while I don't mind playing it, it's just not for me.  The game is highly praised, very accessible to new players, and contains enough strategic depth to interest veteran gamers for at least a few play throughs.  In short, you and other players score points for creating a landscape of cities, roads, monasteries, and farmland by placing tiles side by side like dominoes.  This game is fairly light and easy to play while chatting and talking.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good and easy to adapt theme and game play, although I have better choices if I want to play a game, but when I introduced to non-gamer friends, it's surprisingly well-received and willing to play it again and again, especially 1 of my friend is a good troll and he made the group laugh.

However, I find the farm rule is very confusing for non-gamer since it's hard to define the border with some tiles (I.E: river), I did struggled with it when I first played the game before I was a serious gamer.

There's just nothing in this game for me. I don't hate it, but I don't like playing it either. I find it boring and I couldn't care less how it goes, even though I'm generally very competitive in all games I play. I only play this if others really want to, but I would NEVER suggest to play Carcassonne myself. Never. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.1
Carcassonne is one of those intro games that keeps surfacing. I'll admit I didn't really appreciate on the first playthrough. The second time around I had a slightly better idea of what to expect, so it wasn't so bad. Still, a player's performance does seem unusally impacted by tile draw. That's probably because I don't quite understand what patterns I should be constructing to best leverage the probability space.

It's simple and fast, and I feel like I could learn more about it, but it does get edged out by more intricate games that I'm more familiar with.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Quite fun, although its simplicity and reliance on memorizing the possible tile draws are two strikes against it. Of course, that means more money for Rio Grande when I buy the expansions to solve these problem. Devious!

Still a seven. For the last couple of years didn't play much, but in the last few months several more plays after purchasing the 10 year anniversary version. Nice, easy game. Gotta love the 10 second setup. (30 Nov 2011).

RATING: 5.5
Generally the people I have introduced to Carcassonne have enjoyed it, but after I introduce them to other games, it tends to fall by the wayside.  One problem I have is that I can never remember what the 'right way' to score cities is, there's so many various 'official' ways of doing so that I get them all jumbled.  I highly recommend playing where each player draws their next tile immediately upon placing their current one - this tends to cut down on analysis paralysis as people can decide where to place it while everyone else is playing their turns, and get stuck only if another player's placement changes the strategy on the board.

Revised January 2010 from 6.5 to 5.5 - I haven't played this in almost two years, and even the people I've introduced it to that liked it never even think of it.  It's like one of those games from days gone by that was once a shining star and is now pedestrian.

The kids have taught us we can play nice and still have a good time.

I was always intimidated by the box of Carcassonne and would never pick it. Then a friend plops a baggy of meeples and tiles in front of me, doesn't tell me what it is, explains the rules and I have a jolly ol' time. "Say, M, what's this game called anyway?", I ask. "Carcassonne." And of course, I proceed to consider my life choices that have kept me from playing this cute strategic game. Played two rounds, lost both, but still had a marvelous time. Would wholeheartedly recommend.

As the main game studier, buyer, player, etc. in my group of family and friends, I like games that other people like.  They just make it so much easier for me to get to play games.  I have found that most of my non-gamer friends and family take to Carcassonne easily, so I like Carcassonne.  There's more to it than that, however.  Even though it is a fairly light game, there is enough depth to keep me interested and having fun as well.  There are a lot of defensive moves that are not obvious at first glance, ever-shifting alliences are key, and blending a farmer into an important field always gets a bit of adrenaline flowing.  After having said all that crap about being the main game studier, let it be known that my wife almost always wins at Carcassonne.

Fun tile game, balance between tough decisions and luck. Good for people who are not familiar with games more complex than monopoly.

Carcassonne quarantees many hours of fun with adequate (yet not deep) strategic decisions. The first expansion (Inns and Cathendrals) corrects some missing tiles and completes the game.

Weaseling. 

That is the term we use for sneaking into another player's castle/road/farm. Just like the different groups of people on The Walking Dead, I am sure we all have our own name for those disgusting people. Walkers, Dead, Biters, Idiots... (Never zombies, huh?)

Very fun game to play with any age group. Very Replayable.

Expansions add to the combination. The only expansion that I have added that I did not like was The Tower. Make the game too...Weaselly!

Carcassonne is the granddaddy of all tile placement games. It may not have been the first, but it is the Icon.

My first game session with this game went well, especially when the farmer scoring is included. And I didn't even care about not winning. The tiles are fun to place and of high quality. A very clever and fun game. The only concern is the large footprint, so get a large enough table or play on the floor. Playing on the train or in the bus is impossible. It might not even fit a dinner table for two.

"The mother of all tile-laying games", this one definitely deserves all it's popularity; it's simple and fast, works with any number of players, yet has almost unending scope for tactics, and you get to make a meaningful decision on every round. Highly recommended!

RATING: 7
A classic. Still good after a lot of plays, though I recommend using the "3 tiles" variant. It slows down the game a little bit, but is definitely worth it. I play with two expansions : the first one (Inns & Cathedrals) and Traders and Builders, this makes the games enjoyable and still one of the best in its genre (tile-laying), though I rarely suggest it.

I am charmed with putting tiles! ;)

The river expansion is rather lame.  Scoring the farms at the end of the game is sometimes tedious.  

We play using the rule where everyone starts with 3 tiles, then change the play order to "play a tile, draw a tile".  It works out pretty well and speeds up the game for 5/6 players since people can plan their moves out while waiting for others to play their tiles.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Hm, this is a tough game to judge. While I think it's inherently likeable--there's nothing offensive here, and the tile-laying mechanic is soothing and fun--it simply doesn't capture my interest very well. It seems overly simplistic at times and there just doesn't seem to be much strategy in it--or rather, the strategy seems obvious. Still, it's very well made and pretty; a lot of people enjoy it for its simple and elegant rules. At the time I bought it, I was just venturing out into the hobby so it was the right level of complexity and depth for me. At this point, I like it mainly for new gamers and nostalgia's sake.

Quite a simple tile laying game but can be very strategic for the more experienced players. The idea is to lay tiles to form the board. Each time you lay a tile you have the option to put one of your pieces (Meeples) on that tile to try and get points later in the game. They can be on roads, cities, cloisters or farms. Even though you may have more points early in the game the main part of the scoring happens right at the end when some big scores can start happening.

I would recommend this for kids with autism as I see it a structured game. I would 1st teach it using only the tiles without the meeples to just get the idea of correct tile placement. I would then add just one type of meeple at a time in subsequent games (no farmers) until this concept was understood.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A great game to pull out for the non-gamers. Even if they don't care about scoring points, building cities and roads with the pretty pretty tiles will keep them happy. Just expect some confused looks when you try to explain the farmer scoring. The play adjusts well from two players to more, so it is a great game to pull out for any number of players. My neighbor just brought it home from Germany. Since my wife loves it, I expect I will be playing it a lot!

This comes out several times a week, it's a great 2 player game that my wife loves.  Until I can get her into Memoir this will be the 2 player game of choice.  (TtR also hits the table as a 2 player but not nearly as much as Carc.)

RATING: 7
On the first few plays my wife and I loved this game, but as we racked up more and more games we became increasingly frustrated by the high luck factor involved.

Getting the right tile at the right time is crucial and you can easily get bogged down in waiting for that one piece to complete your personal jigsaw - and sometimes it never comes.

I still rate it highly, but we tend to play other games over this one at the moment.

I know people exist who dislike this game -- I just haven't met them.  Probably the first game to appeal to my wife and me in equally great measure.  Used to be played often -- these days it tends to get overlooked in favor of things with a bit more strategic depth.  Still a winner in our book, though.

Simple enough for a great family game but, at the same time, deep enough (when you add some of the expansions) for the hardcore gamer. Great gateway game. It has now officially "Catapulted the Meeple" ...
2-5 players (Up to 6 with the Inns & Cathedrals expansion)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good gateway game, usually a success with non-gamers. With 4+ players is just a friendly filler without player elimination and quite relaxing. People tend to like the puzzle nature of the map.

Gets a lot more cutthroat if played 1 versus 1. The luck factor is reduced drastically, as you get to draw 50% of the tiles. Big cities lead to interesting fights to get control of them and the farms are key at the end of the game

RATING: 9
I have found that games with up to 4P are quite enjoyable, while 5P games tend to be a bit crowded and hectic, which can be mildly frustrating. I've found that 2P games are a blast and enable you to carry out much more of a cohesive overall strategy than is possible in games with higher player counts. Because it scales so well for two AND offers a 30-45 minute play time, I find that it makes a perfect game for after dinner with the wife. 

Carc is an excellent gateway game, yet still manages to offer plenty of strategic depth. The concept of farmer scoring can be a bit difficult for those new to the game to understand, but it is usually quickly absorbed after the first game or two. Replayability is of course quite high due to the ever-changing nature of the "board", much less the myriad expansions available. This is a well-rounded game which possesses very high appeal, and it is one of my favorites, all things considered.

This game has been compared to Go; I find this comparison to be extremely apt.  Carcassonne's simple game mechanics hide a complex territory control feature that exists simultaneously between 4 board elements.  The addition of expansions adds even more depth and interaction to a game that has tons already.

I've grown a bit bored of Carc, but it's not really the game's fault. The people I play Carc with play it like they're putting a jigsaw puzzle together - "Ooh, why don't you put that city tile there! It'd make a very interesting shape, almost like Australia. And you'll get twelve points for it!"

I really enjoy playing this game semi-cooperatively - I get more satisfaction from placing a nicely fitting piece in the center of a crowded board than I do from scoring points. Unfortunately, this mode of play works less well with 2 players, which is what most of it has been lately.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun with multiple players and super easy to teach. People like learning and playing this game in general. So I'd call it an excellent game for "converting" non-gamers.

So as a multi-player game, it's nice. But as a two-player game, it's suddenly great. It becomes tense and decisions are more important when going head-to-head.

My first Euro and the game that got me back into boardgaming after a long hiatus from wargaming. It's amazing how games have progressed since the mid 1990s. An extremely elegant game (no, I don't believe scoring farmers is difficult) that I'm nearly always willing to play. Probably played 15-20 games before recording plays on BGG.

50 plays: still going strong. The basic game is an excellent game for 2 players (stays at 8).
60 plays: I hadn't played this for many months, but playing again has made me realise what a good game this is. Rating increased to 9.

Not a favorite of mine. My complaints being farm scoring was always fiddly and obnoxious (a bit downfall in a gateway game) placing and scoring small cities and roads in the same turn is lame. For me it just doesn't have either the cool engine building of deeper more solitaire euro experiences or the tighter, more direct interactions of more combat / negotiation oriented euros. It's just a weird blend of building a shared city with extremely limited interaction.

I purchased this game because I had a really good memory of it and it's one of the classics. However, once I replayed it, I have to nuance my rating to a 7 or even 6 because I found it too simple and straightforward for my liking. I guess in the meantime I got used to more complex games.

This rating is with the Inns & Cathedrals expansion.  Without the expansion I give the game a 9.

Very nice game.  I find it relaxing and fun, but still interesting and it really is fun building the cities and countryside.

My rating has gone up after about 20 plays.  

Everybody likes this game.  It is fun, pretty and there is actually a good medium-weight game there.

It is definitely best with 2, but it plays well with three and can handle up to 6 (w/I & C).  The more people you add the less  you can actually plan ahead, so the game because more about tactics and luck.

If I could have only 1 boardgame in my collection it would be this, even without I&C.  Mostly because it has been so universally popular with the people I've introduced it to.

Update:  My rating stays the same. This is the most played game in my collection because my wife loves it. I still think it is a great game, but Daytona 500 takes over as the game I would keep if I could only have one game. The rating will not likely go up, but could edge down as I approach 100 plays. 

Update: Carcassonne is now the one I'd keep. 




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 3
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 3
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 1
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 3

Perhaps my least favorite board game ever, or perhaps my least favorite extremely popular board game.

Boring. That's as eloquent as I can put it. Large gaps between frontrunners and the rest result in de facto player elimination, making it not only boring for those poor saps, but an exercise in futility. This type of game should be no longer than an hour, but it's never taken less than THREE.

Poorly defined scoring. Uneventful turn-by-turn playing (i.e. nothing ever happens).

And for a game that relies so much on artwork...it's hideous. Like, really. An eyesore, to put it mildly.

Look, I admit I don't get the popularity. Guess I'm the wrong one. But really...I hate it.

I must confess I bought this game to convince some people I usually play to stop asking for Settlers of Catan every time. I do believe it will happen.

No wonder it's a classic.

I can't say enough good things about this game.  I love games with a good balance of strategy and randomness and Carcassonne has that, with tile and meeple placement and tile drawing respectively.  I love creating the game board ourselves, tile by tile, and keeping track of which tiles have been drawn; like counting cards!  This is a game we will always play.

Wife and I play this quite a bit and enjoy it everytime. Simple, straight forward, tile laying game. Lay tiles, place meeples and collect points. Personally, I feel this game is best the more players that are in it. With 2 players, it gets stale quickly. Again, it's an enjoyable game, but the strategy aspect doesn't really shine for me. Imagine Kingdomino with meeples....so if you really enjoy tile laying games or love a no stress, layed back, low strategy game, it'll be a great game to add to your collection. In all fairness, it IS a classic game for a reason!

Fun little game, although with the tendency to splurge all over the table! The rules on farmers aren't clear, however local agreements usually apply. I'd give it a higher rating but for the fact that it has too many obvious dead ends when trying to build. If you were born lucky, you'll do well. If, like me, you have the knack of turning over useless cards/tiles, then grit your teeth and hope the gods are smiling.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I like the base game, but not the luck aspect in games using expansions that remove meeple.  In those games, good spots empty up, waiting for someone to draw the right tile and claim the points.

I wouldn't mind playing this some more with family or with cutthroat gamers - both styles could be fun.

My girlfriend absolutely loves this game.  She also loves the expansions, and thus we ALWAYS play with the expansions we own (Inns & Cathedrals / Traders & Builders).  I think that might be the reason I don't give this game a higher score--those expansions just make the entire game DRAG for me.  The base game I do enjoy quite a bit, and the fact that my girlfriend does like it means it will always have a positive opinion from me.

I grew tired of this game after it became a mainstay for "gateway" game groups. When my daughter turned 5 we introduced her to Carcassonne and this renewed our interest in the game. Buying the Big Box helped add some options. Setup and tear down do take a little time, and the game takes up a huge amount of play area, but overall this game has some serious replayability and is extremely versatile. It's well balanced and accessible to most who are willing to play a board game of any type. Few games get anywhere near the gameplay by my family as Carcassonne.

The "modern classic" tile laying game. I love that this game is quickly accessible to teach new gamers and still has enough thoughtful strategy to keep me playing.

An excellent light game.  Enough depth and choices to keep things interesting and replayable.  It also has plenty of luck to keep things fairly even for new and experienced players.

I rarely play this because I'm  more excited about the other more complicated games I own, but it's great to have around for a 2-player with someone less serious about board games.  Easy to teach. Quick games. Would love to try an expansion.

It... need... expansions...

fortunatly, it have! a lot! wonderfull!

this version of the game, without towers, without princess and a lot of new stuff, is a good game, but everytime is the same thing...

so i think it deserve a 7/10 'cause it is a good start for a great game (if you add expansions) even if it is kinda useless without them

RATING: 7
Another excellent game for getting people into gaming.  I've played this a lot.  However, I find to play at a really high level (which is ultimately what I aim to do with a game) it becomes much more tedious, especially with tile counting.  Thus, these days I'll rarely suggest it myself, but I'll always play if it's there.

RATING: 6
A beautiful gateway game that appeals to most non-gamers due to its simplicity. However it can at the same time be somewhat deep, though most strategies for victory are either cuthroat or unintuitive, and that's not good for a gateway game. 

In the end, imo, the game fails at being either a gateway or a strategy game. It's a little of both, but its' one "nature" contradicts the other.

This is my favorite game, and I play a ton of games. Setup takes literally 10 seconds if you know what is going on. Rules are relatively easy to learn and the strategy is easy to grasp but difficult to master. There is no game board, only a bunch of thick tiles with wonderful art and wooden meeple game pieces. Truly a great game to play with anyone! 

PS - if you have older family members who cannot read small print or symbols, this is the perfect game as there is no text involved. Just tiles whose art is matched with adjacent tiles.

Finally got this one myself, after first owning Hunters & Gatherers and Discovery.  I think I somewhat prefer H&G, but the margin is so narrow that I rate them the same on a 1-10 scale.  I'm skeptical about some of the expansions, but I like Inns & Cathedrals and the builder and pig (but not the trade goods) from Traders & Builders.

The best gateway Euro. The decisions are all fairly straightforward, but still allow for serval different strategies. A player making simple, low risk, high value moves can stay in the game. Unfortunately, the game is very fiddly. It takes a while to find all of The available moves on the board and scoring farms is not easy.

Amazing tile laying game. It's also my mom's favorite game, so that's a good thing I guess.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Its good.  It is not fantastic though.  I don't really care for the two player game as much as multiplayer.  That pretty much holds true for every game for me though.  Quick time play, and interesting decisions makes this a quick fun play for 3.  The map looking different and cool to look at is a plus.

This is a nasty 2-player game.  Vicious and cut throat.  Hosage rules high, unless of course both sides play nice, then its a nice light romp.

With 2 players I'll take the base vanilla carcassonne and get 2 rematches in for the light game fix.  I like busting out the City for games with more players.   Staying away from the expansions, because increasing the playing time does not strike me as a bonus.  I'd rather set up the rematch.

RATING: 9
One of my favorite games of all times.  Scales WONDERFULLY from 2 to 6 players it's the same fun.  People who say they don't like this game make me wonder if they are playing passively becuase the game is not a passive game.  Even without expansions like Princess & Dragon and Tower it's a very aggressive game if played correctly.  Don't believe me, give it a go on BSW.

After a lot of agonizing over this I am going to move Carc. up to the coveted 10 rating.  After all this time of playing this simple little tile laying game I still get juiced up playing it. Any game that can do that deserves a 10.

UPDATE: Yes definitely made the right choice moving this to a 10. Fits all the criteria and after literal years of playing I'm still loving Carcassonne.

Great but light. Play two player with my wife. Great game to bring non-gamers into the fold. Really no complaints except to say that it's a bit too much of a souffle for my tastes. Like the variant where everyone holds an extra tile and decides which to play. Increases the skill element.

RATING: 8.5
I just love this game and I bought every single expansion for it. It looks amazing, it plays fast and all players have about the same chance of winning no matter how experienced. Best with 4 or 5 players but also nice for 2 players. I always use the first expansion and one of the others when I play this with a group of 4 or more players. Using 3 or more expansions makes the game less enjoyable. For a gamer that likes to play complex games, its kind of strange that this game is in my top 10. Maybe its because this game got me into boardgames that I have a soft spot for it. But after 50+ games, I still enjoy it every time.

I remember getting very excited about this when we first bought it (2013), and it got me back into board games. I bought a lot of the expansions too, including some of the rarer ones like the plague expansion.

However, it hasn't aged all that well, and we don't play it much now. I'd rather play a good Euro/ Ameritrash hybrid any day, I need PVP combat!

RATING: 10
After enjoying Settlers of Catan for many years, this was the second modern board game I bought, and I was surprised to find there was a game that I liked even better than Settlers.  I no longer enjoy the base game of Carcassonne on its own very much because I've become so used to playing with the Inns & Cathedrals and Traders & Builders expansions, which I consider essential at this point.  I have tried a few of the other standalone versions (e.g., Hunters & Gatherers, Castle, City), but have not been very impressed by any of them, and don't feel the need to own any of them, I even traded away the Castle despite high expectations with Knizia at the helm.  Finally, I think the naysayers of this game fail to play it as aggresively as it should be played, trying to steal opponent's cities/roads, and trap opponent's large meeple/builder.

Was looking for something to take to game night at a friends.  Bought it strictly from recommendations without having played it.  Then went back and bought the two major expansions and the King & Scout expansion.  Have given this game to at least two other people as gifts.  The basic game is good, but these expansions are what sold me.  Can't say I feel the same about the Count, Princess/Dragon, Der Schluss expansions, though.

Have given this an initial score of 5.  I have played it a couple of times, and it was bought for the accessibility for none gamers, but it does not appeal to me now I have played it.

Contrary to what some say, the field scoring in Carcassonne is superior to simple point counting spinoffs as it gives a nice tension to completing cities in fields you own.  However, there are too many dead end roads here that makes the end game usually devolve into who gets the resulting super-field.  Still good tile laying fun even if the hand size of one makes it feel like a game of Magic in top-deck mode.

RATING: 8.6
Simple to teach, which makes it great for newbies, but it has enough strategy to keep it interesting for experienced board gamers.  The games aren't overly long, and there's plenty of opportunities to screw over your opponents.  Works very well as a two-player game, but scales really well too.  It's also a small box, which makes it a great option as a portable game to bring along on trips.  

Good quality durable components, and neat to look at as you gradually build the towns and roads.

It's somewhat luck based and not overly strategic, but there's enough features to keep it interesting, competing for farming space means you can get back into the game even if you fell behind, and the short game time keeps it light and non-frustrating.

This game has too much luck for me.  I place my pieces intelligently, IMHO, but my husband (who makes me play this often enough) always draws EXACTLY what he needs, EXACTLY when he needs it.  I don't think I've ever won, which isn't the game's fault, but it sure doesn't make me interested in playing.

I am sure my grade on this one should be significantly higher, but I may be the worst Carcassonne player in the world. Perhaps I haven't played it with the right expansion but I have enough other games to play, I just don't see this getting down on the table any time soon.

I'm sorry Carcassonne, it is me, not you. You will find a new player soon and I wish you all the happiness when you do.

I didn't play this original version until after many games of The City and The Castle.  It seemed strange after those.  I do think it's a good game, but I really enjoy The City the most.  There's more to do, more meeple option, a fun play element of building the walls and the feeling of the city closing in.  This one seemed kind of lacking.

Well, it's true; the simplest games are often some of the best.  Carc is very easy to learn, but as with most great games you always seem to be learning new ways to win.  Was very impressed with the quality of the components, heavy cardstock with solid pieces.

I've coooled off on Carc a bit, not gravitating towards it as much as I did previously.  I think an expansion would probably rekindle some interest, but the base game & the river are wearing a little thin.  Still, a fun game that I'm always willing to sit in on.

Perfect gateway game into better boardgames.

This was the absolute 1st boardgame I have ever purchased.

When I first started playing I gave this game a 9.5 rating but overtime and as I played more complex games that offer more it has gone down to an 8.5 

It is still a great game but if you have played it over and over and over with the expansions there isn't much else to it.

This game has become a staple of family game night. Simple rules and gameplay make it easy to teach and quick to play.

This game is very easy to teach. Which is great for 1st time players. A few addon's is necessary to add a great level of game play to the game. The farmers portion of the scoring is best if a house rule is used to make it simpler. If you aren't careful and add too many addons you will spend quite amount of time scoring the game in the end. It can be hard to know who is leading going up into the last few turns of the game. Solid tile laying game.

This is a fun strategy game - the rules are straightforward and easy to understand, so you can get going with your first game quickly. Scoring is interesting - sometimes you end up with double the points you expect, and sometimes you feel you are doing well only to end up dead last. You can't rest on your laurels here, you have to keep looking for opportunities at every play. The artwork on the board is really pretty, and the game board and pieces are of good quality. The expansions included (river and abbot) introduce nice variety to the gameplay.

RATING: 7
Carcassonne is wonderfully simple to understand (with a minor exception for the scoring of fields), yet is beautifully open-ended. The playing time is the same no matter how many people are playing, but as more players are added, the luck factor increases due to the randomness in drawing tiles.

Play count for this game includes plays of Carcassonne with or without the River 1 and no other expansions.

Excellent tile paying game perfect for entry level. Never the same game twice, players take it in turns to lay tiles and put pieces on a board to build and complete structures. The rules are well-written and explained; it's only the farm concept that might take some time to sink in. Interaction os limited but you can try to muscle in on other people's structures and farms, although it can can require some careful and devious planning! The wealth of expansions available build on the principles and increase the length of the game. Why on earth we had to wait until the Traders and Builders expansion for a bag to draw tiles out of is beyond me though. I disagree with the price of the expansions - also, why so much packaging?!

I have a fondness for tile-laying games, and this is a good one.  Easily understood and goes down well with all the non-gamers I've tried it with, so it's easy to get a game, but with plenty of strategy.  Screwage factor adjusts nicely to the people playing.

My all time, go to game for 'modern' games.  It was one of my first modern games, and i STILL play this game a lot.  My copy is so well loved, the box is falling to pieces.

I have accumulated many xpacs along the way, but to be honest in recent years me and my group always play vanilla.

Vanilla Carc is one of the best games out there.  Love the tile laying aspect, love the simple premise of 'help yourself or screw an opponent - ideally both'  per turn.

An excellent game for noobs in 'modern' games.  The tile laying and worker placement is often so different to what they have played, that they find it really intriguing.

the ONLY (tiny tiny ) thing i dont super love is that Carc is a game where it is hard to keep pace with the scores...  in some games so much of the final result is counted up post game, that you lose that 'race/keep up/overtake' excitement.

RATING: 7
Extremely good gateway-game which uses clever tile-laying mechanism. It also has so many expansions that if like it you can literally play it with 100 different expansion mixes. I recommend that while playing players should always take a new tile automatically when they have placed the previous to the board, this makes the game a lot faster and reduces downtime enormously. The reason why I give it only 7 is because it is quite light on strategy when you have played it a lot and my group has definitely "exhausted" it with probably 50+ games (same with Dominion).

One of the classic and essential gateway euros, and probably my favorite of the bunch.  It is fun to create a cool looking board together as the game progresses, and each tile one draws creates an interesting decision.  I love that this game can be full of conflict, but it doesn't have to be.  I find that non-gamers get very upset when you get in on their cities, so be careful about that.  The first two expansions are great and really bring my rating on this one up significantly.

If you like games where you actually get to build something during this game this is an excellent choice.  I always get a bit of a buzz seeing the tiles fitting together and flowing across the table.  Sometimes it's quite helpful when playing with several of the expansions to play on a table cloth so it can be slid back towards the centre if players are playing too close to the edge.

A good gateway game for 2 players that I enjoy. 

The game is more fun with lesser players since there are more opportunity to place tiles and build up the castles or roads.

However, the base game can be improved with the addition of some of the expansions such as Traders and Builders, Abbey and Mayor.

RATING: 8
Game play is unique because it involves building the board by tile placement. Easy to learn, fun to play, but can be aggravating sometimes because of lack of control over the tile draws. Also for beginners, it can be hard to grasp the concept of the farmers and how those points are calculated. Should at least try once to form your own opinion.

RATING: 8
The perfect game to show to non-gamers. Everyone I've showed it to has understood it after just a few turns and pretty much everyone has liked it.
 Most of the expansions doesn't really improve it though, they just make it more complex for the sake of complexity, with the exception of "Inns and Cathedrals" wich I highly recomend.

I will play this game any time.  For one thing I have a degree in Geography... so I'm all about maps.  This game is building a map one square at a time.

I have found that I can get anyone, at any level to play this game, and after their first play they are up for playing it again next time around.

Great introductory game with no strategy.. yet great advanced game with significant strategy...

Found a second wind when the boy (at 5) decided he loved it - building castles is fun!  No farmers in this version, obviously.  Actually, when we play as a family, it is nearly a coop game at times - as the game nears its end (and sometimes earlier) we end up helping each other complete our structures.

This game needs no introduction.  It is yet another good, solid game that everyone needs in their game collection.  Some of the expansions are key (i.e. builders and traders).  The only downfall is that the strategic parts of the game can become deluded as one person draws all the great tiles, and you get stuck with 4 way roads.

Good game, actually the first of what I'll call the proper games that I've played. A friend brought it over and I found it very entertaining. Now-a-days it tends to break down into what can only be described as a "farmer-fest"

I don't think I'd have as much interest in gaming if it wasn't for this game, closely followed by Arkham.

I have the following expansions for this one:
Abbey and Mayor
Bridges, Castles and Bazaars
Catapult
Corn Circles 2
Count King and Robber
Count of Carcassonne
Cult, Siege and Creativity
Windmills
Inns and Cathedrals
King and Scout
Little Buildings
Mage and Witch

This was our gateway game. Played 30+ times before we discovered other Euro's. Guy brought it to work and lunches were never the same again. We loved it but started to want to try variants and also bought all the expansions. Now really only play with my son. Adult games are all about placing tiles to hurt the other players. When I play with my son, I play being totally cooperative. Really is interesting on the strategies. My wife rarely wants to cooperate and loses by a wide margin everytime. Still interested in playing, but pretty much only when children are playing. At first it was hard to rate this game this low since we did play it 30+ times, but we didn't know better. It was hard to move to another game (didn't know better) but once we did, we never came back to it. Update: still play this... got my grandmother to play... go intro game (without the farmer rule), beats Uno.

Not as good as The Castle for my wife and me.

Also, our game-playing friends have little interest, there's always something more appealing to them, because this is classic to the point of moldy in their eyes, so it never gets a play with more than 2.

I have a work colleague (yes, Jonathan, it's you) who played this with me on a regular basis. It grew into a very competitive two-player event. Played like this, it is a great game. As a family game, or even with more players, it isn't nearly as good for me.

Carcassonne is a tile-placement game in which the players draw and place a tile with a piece of southern French landscape on it. The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of his meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.

Great intro to Euro-gaming. I've played the iOS version a lot but a group game was wonderful. My wife really liked it and she said it was in her dreams that night after playing it for the first time. There is something relaxing and very satisfying about laying the tiles down and building a town together. A laid back gaming experience, not super competitive. I can see how it is considered a classic Eurogame.

First the drawback, it seems that if you're the type that may only revisit a game every couple of months than this one usually takes a prolonged "so...wait...how do we handle farms again..." before each ensuing play. Now the positives...it's like a song with a simple but catchy melody, unforced, everything just flows. Play goes on and you get to see something built out differently each game.  A good game for those who like the tension of developing an early strategy and then having to adjust as events unfold.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
This is how my wife and I discovered we despise Euro workerplacement games. This, like many similarly pedigreed games, probably plays masterfully with the right group of people. However, with groups that include players more concerned with the overall fun of the table - or especially the fun of one person in particular - it's very vulnerable to kingmaker problems that have always and consistently managed to leave a bad taste in our mouths.

Rating and comments based on 2 player play.

Pros: 
+Easy to learn and teach; good gateway game
+Easy setup
+Deeper than it seems at first glance
+Despite becoming repetitive fairly quickly, "fun" factor seems to remain due to casual nature of game

Cons:
-Once strategy understood by both players, more of a luck-based game
-Limited depth relative to other tile-laying games

Other things to consider:
:Fairly high luck component based on tiles drawn.  But on average, it works out.  :Games are short and relatively casual so increased luck may not be an issue for those avoiding a high luck factor.

It's a fun enough game, but unless you use some variant, it relies on too much on luck for my taste. I still play it in electronic form now and then, but not cardboard.

Edit: Tried a new variant with the cardboard version that I liked, but haven't had a chance to try it again. Will update this after more plays.

Played 3 times now with variant. It's a much better game for us this way, but there are still so many other games we'd rather play instead, it's probably going to have to make room for others.

Ok, I am a carc junkie!  The more you play it, the more evident the potential for strategic play becomes - there is a learning curve in this regard.  Yes, there is a luck factor, but it all tends to average out over the course of a game, especially once you have enough experience to avoid the things that cost you a game, such as putting down too many farmers, having 4 meeples in a single town, etc.

Juego que me sorprendió. Fue uno de los primeros juegos que iba a comprar pero finalmente fui comprando otros y fuí perdiendo el interés en este, además de que me parecía que se me iba a quedar muy pequeño. Pues sorpresa, me lo regalaron por mi cumpleaños y me ha gustado mucho. Eso si, hay que estar preparado para el azar que en muchas ocasiones puede jugar malas pasadas. Aún así siempre es divertido tener algún juego que no todo sea pensar y hacer un monton de cálculos mentales. Lo recomiendo y a la espera de coger alguna expansion para ampliarlo.

RATING: 7
Attractive looking family game with quite a bit of randomness, but still some nice tactical decisions. Not sure if its appeal will last up to the point where some players are able to count the number of different shapes on the table and estimate which tiles are still to come. In my opinion, it is best played as a light game in which the randomness of the tile drawing is accepted and players need to make the most of what they get. Most of its expansions make the game longer and unnecesarily complex. Just add the first expansion (Inns & Cathedrals) and you have all the variation you will need without moving too far away from the original concept.

Excellent game.  WAY TOO LONG with all of the expansions... which is a real shame.  I should look into whether there is a balanced way to reduce the amount of tiles and still use the full rule-set.  I love to play the Mega-Game, or whatever, at GenCon, although the last two times I've ended up with the worst headaches... but I don't blame the game!

Yeah!  I won again at GenCon... no headache this year at least. :)

The game is fun but with the "wrong" type of players, this game can quickly degenerate into something really brutal. Pieces of cities can be added randomly on your opponent's cities to prevent completion of cities. This has turned off many players who abhor conflict. Still, this is a classic game and I won't turn down a quick game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Carcassonne is a "10" as long as the Inns & Cathedrals is included.  This plays best as a 2 player game- more than 2 and it becomes a simple tile laying game.  This can be played friendly or cut-throat.  How much larger should I make my city?  Can I steal this road?  When do I lay down a farmer? A bunch of great decisions.  Plus you have a beautiful map when you are finished.

I will always look back fondly on my time with Carcassonne. It was my first purchase and foray into modern board games. With time though, I've proceeded into heavier territory and this stopped getting any plays. 

Great gateway game with a bit more tactical bite once you have a feel for the tile distribution. Really enjoyable with 2 and works as a light gateway game for larger groups.

Farmer scoring is mildly tricky but they iron out after the first game.

I never really liked this game. I can't put my finger on it, it might be because it seems so simple but as I have heard others mention, there is huge depth beneath the surface. For some reason women I've played this with seem to like it a lot (i.e. my gf and female housemate) and seem to beat me at this more than other games. I'm glad I started boardgaming with Twilight Struggle and not this. If this was my gateway game, I think I might have been put off.

Jogo muito bom, rápido e divertido, com possibilidades interessantes de estratégia. Existem jogos modernos onde o tabuleiro muda a cada jogo, mas normalmente é fixo. Achei muito interessante esse conceito de um jogo de tabuleiro que é criado dinamicamente, ao longo da partida (lembrando um pouco Hive). Apesar da contagem ser um pouco confusa de início, rapidamente acostuma-se com as regras.

Carcassone is really simple but that is also its strength.  My 6 year old nephew can play with us treating it like a puzzle while everyone else can focus on scoring opportunities.  My main concern with the game is that the farm mechanic seems like it impacts the final score too highly (which almost feels out of place given the low complexity of everything else in the game).  A well-placed farmer early in the game (even just being on the initial tile) has greater scoring potential than any meeple placed afterward.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Although good, light fun, a lot of the people I play with enjoy this more than I do. It's a little too simple for my taste, and it really doesn't feel like you can do anything to get ahead. I don't mind some luck, but the strategy here seems minimized.

Can play this game anywhere. Great way to pass time. Over the last couple of years I have grown a bit tired of the game. A bit too simple, not enough choices for me. Now I usually only play it with kids or non-gamers.

I realize Carcassonne is popular.  I try to grade games on what they bring to the table, not what they aren't.  No doubt Carcassonne has brought a lot of people into the hobby.  

That said, I just think there are far too many tile games that are more interesting.  I would recommend Alhambra over this game times ten.  I'm certain that the Alhambra Big Box would be more played and more enjoyed by most average people than Carcassone and its best expansions.  

Carcassonne almost drove me away from all tile laying games.  I tried several times to like it, but it just never felt that interesting.  I only reluctantly tried games like Alhambra and Fjords . . . and realized I didn't have a problem with tile games, I had a problem with just Carcassonne!

Carcassonne, like Catan, deserves its place in history. But just like Settlers, better games have come along.

when i first played this game with my family, i thought it is an easy, luck dependent game you can play with your children without thinking too much. when i later on played the same game with some adult playfellows i lost all the games and i started asking why. a friend recommended me the computer game version of carcassonne and i really bought and tried it and learned a lot about the depth of this game. so nowadays the game reminds me of backgammon: both first look like beeing games of luck, but really aren't if you play a lot of matches. but, and this is really remarkable, i still can have fun playing it with my children, too (and certainly, i let them win most of the time ;-)

Actually, it DID play better with 4.  It seemed like a lot more fun to see what others would do,  and the end result was much more satisfying.

Carcassonne is fantastic casual gaming between 2-4 players. It's sometimes more like doing a puzzle than playing a game.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Carcassonne accomplishes exactly what it sets out to accomplish - it is, like it says on the back of the box, a "simple tactical game". I think this is what people who complain about the randomness of the draw involved miss entirely - it's not intended to be Ora et Labora. I rate it so highly because it accomplishes this very, very well. 

The beauty of it is how the level of competitiveness scales to your playgroup. It can be played in a laid-back way with casual gamers and relatives, a sort of semi-collaborative puzzle where much of the enjoyment is derived from observing the gradual growth of your bucolic French countryside. It can also be a cutthroat battle to the death for 30 point cities and farms. It doesn't force either of these split-personalities on you - it is what you make of it. 

It is simple, elegant, and can be played with practically anyone.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A classic for good reason. Simple, elegant gameplay that provides a nice sense of accomplishment throughout the game for all players with a dash of 'gotcha' for players that want to play aggressively.

Great tile-laying gateway game-- I prefer TtR just slightly over it, but I find this game easier to explain and less stressful for others to play.

Quite nice game, but I have played it simply too many times (before I started logging my games) to get a thrill out of it. Bought it around 2004, very soon after I had discovered I liked Catan, but wanted a game playable by two.
With Carcassonne my weekly Monday-evening sessions started with Herman. Now, three years later, we are with a 4-6p gaming group (-:

RATING: 8
Gameplay changes dramatically with both the number of players and the preferred playing style of the players.  It can be a friendly, I'll-do-my-thing-you-do-yours race for points, or it could degenerate into a I'm-going-to-horn-in-on-everything-you-try-to-do nasty fest.  Both kinds of games can be fun but if everyone isn't on the same page, somebody's going to have a bad time.

Not terribly deep, in terms of strategy, but there is infinite variety. Random tiles force adaptive play and clever human resource management.

Lovely game. Not too taxing on the brain. Just the right amount of strategy, guesswork and a bit of luck to make an excellent 'light' game for gamers, and a very good 'gateway game for otherwise non-gamers. I'm always happy to play this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Can be played cut throat or friendly.  There is some deeper strategy to access in this otherwise simple looking game.  You can use "dud" draws to block off other people's features making them hard to complete.  You can score huge swaths of points by cooperating with other players.  You can backstab people by stealing their giant castles.  You can craftily connect fields to scoop up all of the farmer points.

It would be higher if there was a little less luck of the draw.  1 or 2 bad draws in a row are OK because you can use them to sabotage other players.  But drawing a road for the 5th time in a row is rather annoying.

Carc is a classic. Especially as a two-player game

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Pros: gateway strategy game, tile placement, easy to learn, quick playtime, more player interaction than many eurogames albeit indirect

Cons: high level of luck, high randomness at higher player counts means it does not scale up well

We have the Big Box w/ Inns & Cathedrals, Traders & Builders, Abbey & Mayor, etc. Those are the three expansions we typically play with. Games between my wife and I typically last around an hour and are intense. Doesn't get to the table enough though, because I get sick of losing to her all the time!

Plays listed include any and/or all expansions.

That's right, I don't like Carcassonne. It's a cleverly designed game that holds together well but the theme is contradicted by the gameplay and the randomness of it coupled with the need to destroy one's opponents' work make it one of my least favorite games.

RATING: 8.5
Build the Carcassonne country side by laying tiles and place "Meeples" to score the highest total. One of the quintessential "Gateway Trilogy" (along with TtR and original Settlers). Quick to set-up, good quality components (sturdy tiles with functional graphics, cute meeples), and well designed. With all the expansions out there, I still like the original best and don't mind adding those that don't change the flavor of the original too much: the river I & II and Inns & Cathedrals. I play with 3rd edition rules but score "football" cities as 2pts.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Seems a bit random - most games, there seems to be a very big city or field right from the beginning that if you don't get into you can't win.  I'm not a big fan of this - you just don't have enough control over what's happening.

RATING: 4
This will just never be my favorite game.  I am good at it and will give it a 4/10 when playing strategic variant (3 tiles in hand) but especially in its normal rule set I would only give it a 2/10 because it just doesn't feel fun to build when that construction will never be destroyed, tested against another player, or given certain guidelines and constraints it must meet.  I want to engineer every move to a perfect goal.  When that goal is just the acquisition of points through meeple placement it doesn't have the same luster to me.

Turns out we've been doing the final scoring wrong all these years.  We weren't scoring incomplete roads and cities.  Wasn't that much of a big deal and we even miss being able to keep making an enemy city larger and larger just so it won't complete.

The games are turning vicious and foul words are starting to appear....

Now that we've had a chance to play with 3, 4, 5, and 6, we're pleased that the game handles all the player counts well.  It plays differently, but is still good.

We're also impressed that some non-gamers have taken a liking to it.  I've considered giving it a 9 but going by the text it's not quite an "always want to play."

Carcassonne is one of the ground-breaking new games that hit the market in the 90's and was one of the best games out there at the time, along with Settlers of Catan. However, a decade or two later, there are many other games I prefer. It's a decent game, but I've grown tired of it.

Pretty dull with just the base set, but all the expansions really transform this game into a rich and multi-faceted experience.  I love the fact that the base rules are so simple you can play it with anyone (I've taught 7 year olds the game who have loved it).  By adding on expansions, you can then increase the complexity and help young or new euro-gamers ease into higher complexity playing.  

Also, the game can be incredibly interactive with the expansions in a screw-your-neighbor kind of way, but its such a pleasant, fast-moving game it never gets personal (in my experience, anyway).  Just a blast to play and worthy of it's popularity.

Zzzzz.

Oh, hi. I was just taking a nap after a relaxing game of Carcassonne. Draw a tile, put that tie down on the grid, and decide if you want to put a meeple down. Extremely simple, yet with some strategy going on as well. This is a very relaxing game that isn't very tense at all. Artwork is pretty bland and components are just standard what you'd expect, but the game is just so streamlined and simple and fun. However, it just doesn't really draw me in and get me excited. Just something I'd play while talking about something else with a group of friends.

I personally like this game, though others in my gameing group always want to play something else more.  After 3 or 4 playings, it seems largely luck dependent, but htose who want to take the time to count tiles will certainly have an edge.  Could be very much a beer and pretzels game.  Part of my rating is based on the lack of interest of others in my group.

The game that got me into the hobby.  The base game alone is one of the most accessible and fun gateway games out there.  The end result being a very neat looking landscape.

Maybe I'm still stuck in my board-gaming infancy, but I love this game.  It's probably the most enjoyable game my fiance and I play together, I love it for 2 people as it's much easier to set up your strategies and block the other player.  With the addition of the big meeple from an expansion, you really have some strategic choices to strong-arm the other player and try to steal their buildings.

I really enjoy the fast-pace, quick-turns, and satisfaction of looking at the unique board you created each game.

The reason it stays highly rated with me is that it's just so easy to jump into and play.  Want to play? Okay, grab the bag and pull out a tile.

Have to admit, it's starting to slowly drift down in rating though, as I get more games that I'm more anxious to play.

This might be our favorite 2-player game although sometimes you can be quite spiteful with your city stealing.  I really like how you can include as many or as few expansion as you want and the game works smoothly.  That is probably why I have bought so many of the expansions.  Silly me.

Carcassonne is fun but I find it pretty hard to play without making mistakes with respect to the farms.  Farms can be really large and stretch over much of the board and one has to be careful not to place farmers in a farm already owned.  Otherwise, it's a fun game.

This game gets an extra point for being so spouse-friendly.  Keep it simple, as all the expansions can clog the game's easy flow (especially if used in combination!).

There are more exciting things to do, but who would want to get up and learn all those new rules?

RATING: 4
I picked this up after I read so many good things about it.  I was very disappointed.  This isn't a gateway game, it's just a children's tile-laying game.  The strategy is overly simple, and eventually comes down to memorizing the tile distribution -- Blech!  I've tried using it as a light gateway, but have had very limited success.  Most people I know just kinda look at me funny at the end and say "That's it?"  And god help you if you decide to play with more than three players, as the game drags on with no end in sight.  The rules are minimal and pretty easy to grasp, and the feel is familiar, which is the only explanation I can find for its popularity.  As someone who is entrenched pretty firmly in the hobby, though, it doesn't get me.  Pass.

A good, light game, with many expansions.  The gameplay is fun and tactical but sometimes frustrating.  Still, excellent gateway game.  I have lowered the rating because I feel, now that i have a bunch of expansions, it takes too long for what it is.

Fell in love with this game the first time I played it. Traders and Builders, up's the score by a decimal point.
After playing my games more and buying others I'm going to mark Carc' down from a 9.1 to a 9.0 (or an 8.9 without T&B's)
Lowering the score to an 8.9 to balance out score in context of other games.

Prefer to play with a hand size of 3 tiles, but also enjoy draw one, play one method too.

I thoroughly enjoy the ability to collaborate on building cities and roads in this game (of course, my wife ends up usually scoring the most points with cities, but that's a different story). On the other hand, the game isn't as deep as some of the other games of a similar weight in our collection, so this doesn't make it to the table too often. I can still see us playing it from time to time, but I don't see us making it a priority.

RATING: 7
Rated after 19 confirmed games. The game is not at all bad, but it is getting a little bit boring and it seems that there is always something nicer to play. But if this would be the only game around, I would have no problems playing this. There is something in that simplicity, it might be called genius or something... But in the end, may be a little bit too simple.

Updated almost four year and couple of games later: Not a bad game, once I have survived the small "cult of the new" phase, I have realized that there is place and time for good old games. There will be good games made in the future, but also lots of bad games. The mechanics are same, no new ones are coming every year and so on. Game is a classic, easy to teach and play, enjoyable also with non-gamers and a two player game can be finished in half an hour. I need to play this more in the future.

5 duels during Christmas, a simple and quick game which offers tactic choices. When played in about 30 minutes it is quite a nice filler.

22 duels recently, some with expansion, some with just the base game. Good game.

Great game! While mostly tactical, farmers and Majority Rule for scoring points means that is strategic play as well despite the naysayers. Have not played with House rules, don't plan to. 

Often use Traders and Builders, I like The Dragon but I don't like the Fairy; Dragon appeals to my dragon/Ameritrash heart, and the fairy upkeep/fiddeness annoys my Ameritrash heart. 

Inns and Cathedrals good to. 

Need to try other expansions.

[b]Summary:[/b]
Fantastic tile-placement game for families and couples. If I only had one family board game to play, I'd choose Carcassonne, Agricola, or Bohnanza. If I only had one tile-laying game for two players, I'd choose Akrotiri instead. Carcassonne is fun and can be long or short. It's easy to learn and works with different kinds of players.

+ Straightforward. Good for families. Good for couples. High quality. Good longevity.
- Can be too long and AP-prone with larger adult groups. (Use a timer if needed.) No one is forced to use spite/aggression, so one player might be frustrated when another player chooses to.


[b]Rules:[/b]
The rules are very simple and easy to learn. The rulebook is clear.

[b]Components:[/b]
Components are straightforward but of good quality with clear, slightly interesting art. Ours have lasted without any damage whatsoever through MANY plays.

[b]Theme:[/b]
Generally works. It's about laying out a countryside with little villages, cities, roads, etc. (and more depending on expansion use.)

[b]Luck:[/b]
There is a constant luck of the draw, since this is a tile-laying game in which tiles are drawn from a stack rather than purchased from an auction. You may place them nearly anywhere, however, which greatly mitigates this luck. Decisions are more important than the draw.

[b]Interaction:[/b]
There can be a fair amount of interaction if players decide to focus on laying tiles in such a way that other players cannot complete their plans. For friendlier players, the game feels like solitaire building or even coop building. There will usually be ONE player in a group of 4 or more who thinks more interactively than the others, but this has always been fun in my experience rather than upsetting anyone.

[b]Strategy:[/b]
Long-term planning is essential for most players in most games, mostly due to the luck of the draw. If you start a big city, you may not be able to complete it for quite a while. If you decided to farm, you need to make sure cities are built around it.

[b]Tactics:[/b]
Tactics may seem minor in Carcassonne, but they come into play often. Placing city tiles near someone else's city might allow you to take over, or at least prevent them from completing a city. This choice often trumps the possibility of expanding your own city and getting points for doing so.

[b]Analysis Paralysis:[/b]
Everyone seems to experience some AP in this game until they're used to it. Even then, a few turns will have AP due to too many options for a tile or due to the noticed options not having clear advantages over each other.

[b]Difficulty:[/b]
Very easy to learn and play. It's not that hard to master, but somehow manages to be fun after many plays.

[b]Length:[/b]
Depends on the number of players. It is often long but really doesn't need to be. I recommend playing with a timer to make it a little more exciting and speedy. This isn't necessary though, unless you're playing with a very AP-prone player.

[b]Replayability:[/b]
I eventually grew a little tired of Carcassonne after many plays. I needed a break. Now that I've had the break, I'm ready for more. Expect this to have more longevity than most games in your collection if you have the right players in your group. It's excellent for parents to play with their children, for example. I'd primarily recommend it for that and for couples. Buy the Big Box for more variety and complexity.

I give Carcassonne credit where credit is due: brilliant concept of building the board like a puzzle as the game progresses; also, a pretty solid "gateway" Euro game.  It also introduced the "meeple," which has become the icon of the board gaming community.  But Carcassonne is far from perfect.  The scoring is jacked.  Certain elements (like farmers) are way too OP.  This game also gets way too cumbersome with the gagillion expansions.  I keep it around because it's a staple game, a cornerstone of modern tabletop gaming.  But it almost never hits the table anymore.

I personally don't care for it a ton. I'll play rarely and I'm willing to give expansions a try to attempt to spice it up, but if I never play Carcassonne ever again, I'll be fine with that. 

One of my biggest complaints is the spiky cities that develop, and the way farms are scored/formed. Neither of those things are truly terrible, but they bug me enough to lower my enjoyment of the game overall. I've also had personal issues understanding some cases where spike edges of cities touch or come close to each other, and whether it forms a connected farm. Again, not a gamebreaker but it did affect my enjoyment. 

For a new/novice gamer, I think there are better light games out there like Ticket to Ride or King of Tokyo. For an experienced gamer, there are way better and prettier tile laying games that have come out.

UPDATE: For trade/sale with expansions. The unintuitive farmers' rule makes the original Carcassonne awkward with non-gamers (or anyone who's playing against a mathematically-strong opponent). Additional expansions make the game fiddly and outstay it's welcome. I prefer Hunters & Gatherers.

A classic. Simple to learn, but hard to master. Small and easy to store with attractive tiles.

Hate it or love it, Carcassonne is one of the cornerstone games of the Euro game hobby, and its spot is one that can't really be taken by any other game. This is because there are so many things that are original and innovative about it.

It's my parents favorite game, and once I introduced them to it they went out and bought their own copy and four of the expansions right away.  And thus I enjoy playing it because I get to play with them.

RATING: 6
Yes, it has the luck of the draw, and yes, the farmer scoring rules are nebulous and confusing.  So what?  This is a game with a lot of staying power, thanks to the expansions and the appeal to all kinds of gamers.  Players familiar enough with the game to know when all sorts of a certain tile are out will have an advantage, but if you can memorize all of the tile types, then you deserve a bit of an edge.  This rating is with the River expansion only, as it's the only way I've ever played the base game.  I can't say how well it plays without.

2 plays: 4 players

Grande jogo. Vale muito a fama que tem. É extremamente simples, qualquer um consegue jogar. Ao mesmo tempo, há possibilidades de fazer estratégias para atrapalhar os adversários, e tentar se dar bem.

Esse é um jogão, recomendado pra qualquer um.

Vamos ver agora com a expansão como que fica.

I liked it but i don't think that it deserves to be so high in the rank (at least not for my tastes) because of it's replayability. As soon as you understand what you have to do in order to win, you can do the same over and over again and if you get the right tiles, you are going to win.

First couple of times i played Carcassonne, i thought 'meh, ...ok, just ok'.  Later on, the more i played it, the more i loved it.  It grows and grows, longer roads, more cities, bigger cities, happy feelings when you draw the right tile to complete your masterpiece :).  This i find, is a relaxing game, is it the soft-colourd artwork?  the step-by-step growing process?  I can't tell but i like it a lot, thumbs up for this game!!

I love tile map games and this one is a great one. I enjoy the creativity of placing meeples to score in various ways; roads, castles, abbeys, and farms. My kids (ages 11 and 12) had a hard time grasping the farm concept so sometimes we do without those. Very enjoyable and replayable.

Carcassonne is a tile-placement game in which the players draw and place a tile with a piece of southern French landscape on it. The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of his meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.

Ett trevligt spel där man bygger upp landskap med vägar, städer mm och "inmutar" olika saker och får poäng. Finns flertalet bra och sämre expansioner och vi fick också tipset att man kan skippa regeln med "bönder" som inmutar stora fält och på så sätt minska komplexiteten och spela med sina barn - det ska vi testa!

RATING: 7
A bit luck-heavy for me these days, but one of the first modern board games I got to play, as it is for so many other people.

I enjoy the leisurely pacing, the theme and the fact that new players can still win thanks to luck of the draw.

I don't enjoy that knowing what tiles are possible makes such a difference to strategy. It's no fun either to have or not to have an advantage in that respect. And counting the tiles on the map and comparing them to the counts on the back of the box is not the done thing, so it's hard for somebody not to have an advantage.

A light game. Me and my wife had no fun playing this. We found it fairly boring.

Also the farmers make the scoring confusing for casual and new players. This lowers its effectiveness as a gateway game considerably also. We prefer battle line, san juan or LOTR:C instead. 

**Update: Finally sold it away. I have found better gateway games now.

I own the Big Box edition. I really dug this game the first few times. After a while, it started getting a bit old. The problem is that the turn consists of one very simple action. Pick a tile and place it in a legal spot. Sure, there are choices but most of the time, I find that there are one or two obvious options. Furthermore, in larger group games, the map becomes too chaotic.

Perhaps, I'm not playing this the "right" way. Anyway, I still like it and I'll play it if it is on the table but I probably won't suggest it.

The vanilla game fell as flat as a polished mirror surface. Draw-a-card-now-lay-it-down is just too random for us.

I am a sucker for tile-laying, though, and we have not tried any expansions yet, so there is still hope.

A clever tile-laying game. The southern French city of Carcassonne is famous for its unique Roman and Medieval fortifications. The players develop the area around Carcassonne and deploy their followers on the roads, in the cities, in the cloisters and in the fields. The skill of the players to best develop the area will determine who is victorious.

Played this with five, and I was a bit worried about how confrontational it would be.  It wasn't bad, but then again, no one was targeting me.  Fun to try focusing on getting points in different ways and to look for ways to get into the high scoring areas.

RATING: 6
The beauty of Carcassonne is in its plug and play expandability. There are piles of interesting expansions for this game, almost all of which can be added or removed without negatively impacting gameplay. In fact, using different combinations of expansions drastically alters gameplay strategies (and almost always in a good way). The game has never really gotten old, mainly because we are always trying new things with it. Every time Carcassonne hits the table, it is with a different combination of expansions. As such, every play is a whole new experience.

I also enjoy the fact that the game can be played as a relaxing social experience or a brutal gamer showdown. There is a surprising amount of screwage that can be passed around the table for such an unassuming little game, yet you can just as easily play nice and make pretty pictures. For me (and my group, for the most part), this is one of those rare games that has gotten better after every play. I remember being lost my first play and confused my second, then loathing even sitting down for my third game. After the scoring mechanisms had finally sunk in, I found myself compulsively wanting another play. It's a hit with my wife, my kids, and most of my gamer buds, What more could you ask for?

Recommended Variants: Always play with a starting hand of two or three tiles instead of simply drawing and playing off the top of the stack. This adds even more strategy and planning to what is already a deceptively deep game.

Rating dropped to an 8 after playing Carc: The Discovery, which is a better game and also highlights some of the problems with this one.

This was my gateway game, and it's still one of my favorites (and one of the only games my wife and I both enjoy). I find the base game to be very relaxing and a nice balance of skill and luck. Another huge plus is that it can be played very cutthroat or nearly cooperatively depending on the preferences of the players, which gives it a lot of flexibility. About the only downside is that I've found one player drawing more than about 75% of the monasteries virtually guarantees victory, but that doesn't happen often. This may be the only game that I think all gamers should own, because it's such a wonderful introduction to the hobby; out of literally dozens of people I've introduced the game to, only 2 did not like it (and they both have admitted to disliking any game where it takes more than one sentence to explain the rules, so I don't think anything would've been a hit with them).

okay I might get some flak for this review but I can honestly say..I don't see what most people see in this game. Ill start with the positives I suppose and I can say that I do like the artwork in here. Other then that I find this game really boring.  Place tile, add meeple  score points....theres not too much of a competitive feel to this and in most cases theres isn tmuch strategy in places meeple...most just put their meeples on every new road, farm or town.....rhis is a game that will probably gtet pulled out once in a blue while when someone asks about it, but that's about it. A really big disappointment
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The base game is a bit too simple, in my opinion, but throw in a few expansions and Carcassonne is good fun.  My wife and I played this quite a bit as a two-player game, and we both definitely prefer it that way after trying it with larger groups.

My game came with the River and King & Scout expansions.

RATING: 7.5
Carcassonne took the hobby in a whole new direction; gamers and non-gamers can compete on a more or less equal footing, with the luck of the tile draw a factor.
Not enough interaction for my taste - I suspect I'll say the same of most Euros.

:gg:Estupendísimo juego medieval de colocación de losetas, para varios jugadores, rapidito, estratégico, divertido, super sencillo, con su pequeña dosis de "quemacocos", sin agobios y funciona genial con todo el mundo, sobre todo con iniciados. Es muy rejugable y cómodo (no requiere mucha mesa) y además tiene mucha adicción. La temática medieval le da un regustillo muy agradable. Prefiero jugarlo a 2 jugadores, donde la partida se vuelve muy táctica, que con más jugadores, donde se vuelve más caótica. Con las expansiones de Posadas y Catedrales, Constructores y Comerciantes, La Princesa y el Dragón, La Torre, El Conde, El Río I y El Río II.

One of the first games I bought. I used to like this more, but with discovering and playing other games, this games has dropped as I moved on. My main complain about this game is counting the points for the farmer, which is not intuitive. It's certainly a good entry for non-gamers and probably children. I like the expansion and the river tiles, but the other expansions don't do anything for me. UPDATE: Sold it (games should be played, not collecting dust on the shelves).

RATING: 6
A simple tile-laying game that looks good and plays quickly. Good for non-gamer family members to introduce them to more euro-style games. Some interesting decisions to be made around how to maximize your score. The base game by itself has sort of eclipsed for me but I think additional expansions would breathe extra life into it.

This is a good game for everyone but young children (it requires some patience). This game is beautifully made. Even my son commented on how nice the pieces are. The art is wonderful to look at while you're playing. It's a very simple game but can play either casually or strategically. It's a great introduction to longer strategy games. Still..if I were to purchase again..I'd definitely choose Settlers of Catan over this.

Don't like this game. How can you like a game where at your turn you get a tile at random and everyone knows what's the best place to place your tile? Sucks completely in 2-player, poor game ir 3-player, and only in 4-player starts to give some fun.
Update: I did not try this (already sold the game), but I think game would be much better by letting player to always have 2 tiles in hand, and then during his turn take third and decide which one of the three tiles he wants to place. Idea taken from Beowulf the Movie Game. Should bring more strategy and less pure luck. Should work especially well with Traders&Builders expansion - where you could plan ahead where to place your builder based on what tiles you have in hand.

I don't enjoy this game because I find that I have no good options so I just do something, to get to the end as fast as possible. 
I even played the variant where you draw two pieces and chooses one and the other one is out of the game. I still don't like it. I feel it create problems in the end when a lot of good pieces has gone out of the game and my options is just getting more and more limited all the way through.
I want more options, not just a draw and place pieces.

The base game of Carcassonne holds no fun for me. It's rather ugly, luck based and unexciting. It was novel when I first played it but I lost interest quickly. Played this some time ago again, and I was reminded why I hadn't played it for so long in the first place.

RATING: 7
This was our first game, back in Australia. I think of it more these days as a competitive puzzle game, and don't enjoy it if I'm playing with hardcore gamers. It becomes really nasty with all the point denying activities that get used. My spouse and I enjoyed it more when we just stick to our own side of the river. Hunters & Gatherers is preferred to this, perhaps due to the fact that it is a more complete stand-alone game. We normally play the base with Inns and Traders expansions. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Can be a bit boring to play. I suppose it works as a gateway game but for some reason the scoring of the fields seem to be difficult for people to grasp. The game offers a limited amount of options and decisions which leads to the aforementioned boringness.

Another game that I've sacrificed in favour of the iPad version. I love Carcassonne and I enjoy the strategy once a few expansions have been thrown in there. I don't know if it's because of it's friendly appearance, but I often find a game of Carcassonne losing it's competitive edge because player will opt to help each other out to make the towns and roads fit together regardless of who it benefits. But maybe that's just my cut-throat nature coming out!

Everyone seems to love this game, and I don't get it.  The appeal is that it's light, easy to understand, and good for new gamers who aren't that serious about getting into games.  But I am a serious gamer, and this game just has way too much luck involved.  It takes skill and strategy too, but because tiles are drawn randomly from the box each round, and that not every tile is of equal value, chance has a lot to do with who comes out on top.  And with the score board keeping track of who's in what place, it can be very very frustrating for the person in last place who keeps drawing "roads" while another player keeps drawing the one very specific tile she needs to complete her huge castle.  I don't have fun playing this game, I just find myself getting angry.

I think it's the first eurogame I've played, and probably the first game I've played in my adulthood. It's a very good introduction to modern board games, but it does feel a little too simple after a while.
There are many expansions and they do change the gameplay, but with more than 2 of them, the scoring becomes more and more complicated.

There's a reason this game is one of the most popular game after Settlers. Personally found it a little light, but will play it when requested. My wife is the Carcassone queen and she beats me almost everytime. Expansions are a must for a different experience.

RATING: N/A
A light tile-laying game where players pull a tile from the pool and place it against one of the previously played tiles. If you start a city, road, farm or monastery, you can place one of your control markers on the tile, which is then scored when that feature is complete. However, farmers are not returned and will score points at the game end.

Good tile laying game that will forever have a place in board game history as without it we wouldn't have the term meeple. Unfortunately this game can be AP prone, despite being so light, which can make it much less enjoyable for me if you get people who can't just pick a spot to put their tile in a reasonable amount of time.

RATING: 7.825
Classic and simple tile-placement game.  Place a tile so that it matches all other sides (like a jigsaw puzzle) and then claim a feature on that tile (a road, an abbey, part of a castle or a field), then the next person places a tile and claims a piece.  Simple but entertaining and a good choice of game if introducing someone new to boardgaming - minimal learning curve, quick and easy set-up, and not too long (if you don't include any expansions...)

1/21/2009: Last of my 1st shipment of BGG-favored games to be played. Included "free river expansion" but did not play with it the first time. Similar to Ticket To Ride, it was easy to learn and fun in the first session! In fact, it went quicker than TTR (though our first play was 2 players instead of 4 with TTR). This game definitely has a future in my home.

2/10/2014: And the above has certainly turned out to be true. Very recently introduced it to my 4 year old and played a coached play without using Farmers. He seems to like it.

RATING: 7
I like this game but for how light it is I feel the scoring rules are rather odd. Don't get me wrong I actually prefer games where no one knows who is winning until the end but there are a lot of "if this then this" type rules for scoring in an otherwise extremely light game

Great game for friends and family that don't play as much, really like the expansions too. :) One thing I love/hate is the field scoring and competing for the fields by placing your guys sneakily into the bigger field. It feels really 'gamey' in a bad way at times which hurts the game a bit.

Het inmiddels al klassieke tegellegspelletje.

Carcassonne is nou echt zo'n spel dat je nooit zal voorstellen, maar als je het eenmaal zit te spelen, dan vind je het toch wel leuk.

Spelers bouwen stuk voor stuk aan de stad carcassonne en zijn omgeving. Maar dit doen ze niet voor niks. Door hun horigen te plaatsen op wegen, weilanden, steden en kloosters kunnen ze hun invloed vergroten. Maar kijk uit dat je niet al je horigen inzet voordat ze terugkomen van hun werk.

RATING: 5
The game that got me interessted in boardgames again after several years of inactivity.  Now it has grown a bit stale though, perhaps some of the alternative rules here on BGG can breathe new life into it.  

Nice quick game to play while waiting for late players anyway.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I have more plays of this than any other game. There is some luck, in the form of the tiles that you draw from the bag. This game reminds me a bit of putting together a puzzle. I may often get as much joy from just piecing together the city of Carcassonne as I do from winning.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
We have had Carcassonne for about a decade now.  We don't play with any of the expansions other than sometimes the river expansion.  It is a great tile laying game.  To me this game is about the right time frame (30-40 mins) as well as the right level of complexity (on the lighter side) for what I like.  It is quick to teach in a few minutes with the farmers as the only complex concept that people struggle with the first game or two.  It really only takes a game for people to be close enough in skill level to have a reasonable game.

What I Liked:
-Low learning curve.
-Minimal setup
-Enjoyed the light theme and game play

What I didn't like:
-Toward the end of the game, the game can become really basic, with the most efficient placement being obvious.  It can become a matter of who gets the best tiles.

Final Thoughts:  Great gate-way game with simple rules and minimal setup time.  Fun and interesting gameplay, most of the time.

The gameplay is easy enough.  The mechanic rules are about as simple as you can get.  But the scoring, particularly the farmers, can be tough to work out.  Of the 6 pages in the rulebook and supplementary example sheet, about 5 are dedicated to an explanation of the scoring.  There are plenty of FAQs for this game, and one of them explains the farmers simply:  if the farmer can walk to the city without crossing a road or leaving the tile borders, it counts.

Its simplicity is its elegance.  No two games are the same.  It plays great with two, and better with three.  Best of all, it's never too long.

I find Carcassonne 2 player to be very dull. 3 player is fine though, nice as a light not-too-competitive game. I also don't like carcassonne played super-competitively, because there is too much luck in getting the right tile to steal the big farm or city.

Plays very well with children. Ever a 3 year old can play with this game, using this just as a jigsaw puzzle. Then as they get older, you can add more & more rules.

Don't understand the evergreen effect of this one. It's a kids game, and even at that there are better alternatives nowadays. The first time I played it I was quite pleasantly surprised. Also, I do respect it for introducing the tile laying mechanics. However, I feel rather disgusted when thinking about it right now. Overall, I played 3 times and am bored to death with it. The game is also extremely heavily luck depended. The graphics are also not my style and put me off.

A good solid game. Easy to teach with some deeper strategy to learn with multiple plays. Need to distinguish between full-out competitive (dirty) play and more (family) 'friendly' game play. Can become a bit repetitive over time.

My foray away from my roots and into more Euro games has finally led me here.  And I have to say... I like it.  Quite a lot actually.  It can be played in so many different ways and is open to different strategies, yet its simple tile drawing/laying mechanic allows even non-gamers to quickly grasps the concepts involved.  I have read a lot of comments about how confusing the farmers are but that has not been the case for my group.  I have also read that this game can be very cutthroat... ahem... that HAS proven to be true with my group.  And thats what I love about it.

Update - Still a staple and no sign of fading.  We now play without the river and with a hand of three tiles.  This combined with the abbey opens the door for a lot of combinations and pre-planned plays.

I play this with several different groups at different levels. My girls, age 8, like it. I just dropped farmer scoring off for them. My wife and older sons like it and I play it with others frequently.

UPDATE:

Now my girls age 10 are playing with farmer rules. They are still very excited about this.

I still enjoy this. It had seen a dropping off because I find it not very deep but I have had more people ask to play this and it has come into rotation again. Overall a pleasing game and I have started adding the better expansions in which give it a little more strategy.

2014-12-22:  It is a mediocre game that non-gamers seem to enjoy.  Some of the expansions make it more strategic and add some more interesting decisions.

Get the Carcassonne big box instead of just the base game of Carcassonne by itself as it is seriously lacking the fun so we sold off our basic set.

My friends have taught me to play with the expansions (eg. Cathedrals and Inns, Traders and builder,etc) on BSW and I like it very much.....More cut-throat too. 

Hubby agreed the Carcassonne big box is so so so much better!

Definitely a staple game for people to check out when new to the boardgame hobby or to use as gateway game. I love to look back at how the game ended and how the world was shaped by the players.

Over the years it has lost its shine for me. I still like playing the game, but I don't readily offer this game to the gaming table any more, due to other 'shinyer' games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
In combination with the Inns & Cathedrals expansion, Carcassonne is one of my absolute favourite games. It was the one that really got me interested in "geeky" games, and led me to BGG.

But to me, "vanilla" Carcassonne is good, but lacks something. Roads, especially, score too poorly, so that if you draw a lot of road tiles you'll probably lose the game. It only really achieves its potential once Inns & Cathedrals is added -- and compared to the cost of the base game, that's relatively expensive (though the combined cost is still a lot less than many games).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.2
Base game is enjoyable, and quick.

Rating goes down exponentially if more than 4 players are involved. I think it's optimal with 2, and still very good with 3. I would opt out with 4 although I can see it being [i]decent[/i] with that many as long as turns go quickly.

I used to always play with I&C and T&B mixed in, but lately have picked only one major expansion to play with since tactics, tiles, and game length all seem to stay more fresh. Although we do include the K&S (excluding bonus mechanic) and Mini Expansion tiles in every game.

I prefer the base game with the Mini Expansion only or with I&C included. T&B is a good expansion but in a way over-complicates things for me. I like this is a quick, light game with subtle conflict; my personal opinion.

I've played a ton of the iOS version, typically 2 or 3 player games against strong or evil opponents only. The app is incredible.

My go-to gateway game.  This is a great game to bring to family gatherings as it's super easy to teach. New players tend to have trouble with farms, but remove those and anyone can play.

Best game playing with your close friends, all of my friends love it so much.
I really suggest to play it in groups, which means 2 or three people work together and all their scores add up together, that reduces the chance of getting frastrated by keeping getting bad chips, and can also reduce your friends' feeling of "you are so mean!" when you play against him, because you are representing a group and playing againt another.

Modern classic. Everyone should own this game. I use the house rule of drawing your new tile at the end of the turn, instead of the beginning. This really speeds up turns as players have a chance to look at the board while waiting on their turn and usually know where to put their tile by the time it is their turn again. I just played this recently and it STILL holds up.

Great brainless game.  If you have a lul in your game night and you just feel like playing a quick game this is the one.  All you have to do is build a little world out of neat little pieces and place your little people on the board and make points.  The only part about this game that can be a bit complicated is counting up the points at the end, you just have to pay attention.  Overall a fun game and it is pretty quick, maybe an hour or so.

COMMENTS REV 2 (11-10-8):

I've since discovered an ideal place for this game with children 4 to 10. They love it. It's structured block building.

COMMENTS REV 1 (Early 2011):

Me to 15yo dd: "I think I actually don't like Carcassone."

15yo dd: "I know.  I don't either.  It's totally boring. It's like the same game every single time, and if you're not playing with some one who's paying attention it's even worse."

Me: "Yes.  And nothing actually ever happens---just the plodding of your meeple around the point track, and then a settlement at the end.  It's like Scrabble without all the laughs."

15yo dd: "Totally."

I think it's the endemic problem of puzzle games.

My adult-like peers have tried to convince me that it's more cunning and subtle than that, but I'm not buying.  Carcassone is a flash in the pan.  Or we'll have to figure out how to add combat.

COMMENTS REV 0 (early 2010):

I get an Endorphin rush just thinking about playing.

There's no luck in this.  Randomness, yes.  But not such that will deter skill.  Use a handicap curve.

An excellent gateway game.  My top pick for best gateway game right beside Ticket to ride.  This game is the king of tile laying games in my opinion due to it's simplicity.  Strategies are simple and if you play nice, you'll most likely lose, but still have fun doing so.  The expansions add so much to the game that I feel like they are an essential purchase.  Especially Inns and Cathedrals, as well as, Traders and Builders.  I enjoy Isle of Sky more because its a bit more of a gamer's game, but this one is a classic design that is timeless.

One of the best "easy to play" games ever. I expect from board games that they will give me much satisfaction in short time.

In conclusion - this game brings you as much fun as it can give in such a short time it is need to play. Rules are easy, you can play in 2 persons. Nothing more is needed.

It's not about luck, it's about using your piece well. One of my favorite games when get a game against good player. IMO this is best as 2p game because it turns more luck and co-operative game when more players (all attacking against winning player).

Simply one of the best games ever made. Quick, simple rules, lots of strategy, agonizing decisions, and beautiful components. A must for anyone's collection. Opinion has downgraded from a perfect 10 with the inclusion of the expansions, which lengthen the game, and the introduction of Hunters & Gatherers, which is far more streamlined.

Un juego perfecto para iniciar a nuevos jugadores. Es un juego de colocación de losetas, de 2 a 5 jugadores (resulta perfecto con cualquier número de jugadores) donde lo más importante será poner correctamente a tus peones. La estrategia pasa obligatoriamente por conseguir que tus peones granjeros estén bien colocados.

RATING: 8
Good game to pass the time. a bit boring, to be honest. There isn't much going on the board.

!!UPDATE!!

The more I play this game, the more I enjoy it and 3 years later and my opinion totally changed. I used to rate it at 6, but now I give it an 8. Why?

a) It's extremely simple to setup and teach.
b) It has an element of puzzle solving with endless variation. Every game is never the same. Different player offer different challenge.
c) It has good interactivity among players to guarantee any session will always be lively and lighthearted.
d) It has the perfect length. It's not too fast that you feel you haven't done anything, but not too long that the game overstay its welcome.

I'm one of those guy who rotates his collection a lot. Of all the light/medium game that I bought, Carcassonne is the only one I keep and will never be sold.

Carcassonne probably hit the table more than any other game of mine for a full year of time. EASILY moddable, easy to teach, easy to play, and amazingly cut throat, I've taught the game to veterans and grandmothers alike. While it's been relegated to only occasional play these days, sometimes no other game can scratch the itch... Just beware of too many expansions.

RATING: 7
Very easy to pick up and play, rules are simple enough to explain even to my family and relatives who don't speak English.  The game is good with any number of players.  While the gameplay itself is fairly straight forward, with your ability to score largely depending on the tiles you draw, I think the most strategic element of the game is the farmer, which often give an amazing amount of points at the end of the game, without the player's realization.  Carcassonne is also great because of the amount of socializing it illicits, everyone gets to participate during anyone's turn.

Update #1: Game seems to take longer and longer after each successive plays, rather than the other way around (even with only one additional expansion).  Too much metagaming during other people turn for my taste, I try very hard to just keep my mouth shut and let them do what they want, but sometimes it is maddeningly frustrating when they take forever.  Especially annoying when someone goes I'll help you out if you do this for me.  This isn't a negotiation game!

This was one of the first games I purchased. I really like it from the start: you could play it cut throat, but you could play it casual also. There are a ton of expansions here, I have a handful of them and I have to say... not all of them makes sense to me. It's a bit long if you include too much expansions (like more than 2) at the same time, and doesn't handle well a lot of people. With 2 or 3 it's quite a good game. With 4 it's sort of ok, but with more it becomes too random and chaotic.
We stopped playing this game lately which is a bit of a pitty. It's the favourite game of my sister.
Play count definitely not accurate, since I have played this before I discovered bgg.

Costed about 2400 HUF if I remember well.

Excellent game of placing tiles and meeples in a developing world. Every single action is to be well thought or it could be dangeorus for your next moves. The interaction is very high and the right use of tiles and meeples is a blend between building your own streets and cities, aggression of others' properties and defense of your domain. Not all the expansions seem to be well deployed, so try to follow the BGG rating, it's a good compass.

Part of Carcassonne: Big Box

I played Hunters and Gatherers before this, but I am glad my wife and I decided to invest in the Big Box with all the expansions.  We have already played each expansion separately and are looking forward to a mega-game with all of them!

Edit: The mega-game takes quite awhile and I find that we forget to utilize one or more of the features from the expansions (eg the fairy).  Still, it is fun for the fact that you get to see so many tiles down on the table.  I wouldn't play like that too often, but it is worth it once in awhile.

Edit: I am a little annoyed that the Abbey and Mayor expansion is coming out...

Easy to teach and fun to play. My gf loves it as it involves building up stuff amd has just about enough confrontation. Personally I like it more with less players: it makes for a more strategic and cutthroat experience.

Update (Aug 2012): after few dozens of plays with the base set I can safely support who says this is a classic. Games play smoothly one after another, and no game feels repetitive or boring. To me it's an experience like a good ole trustworthy card game (like Spades perhaps), but more fun thanks to the bits and flavor of the game. I'm starting to include expansions right now, so my current 8.5 could potentially grow.

Update (Dec 2012): still a good game, but a combination of factors has made me decrease substantially my desire to play it. I can still appreciate the elegance and smoothness of gameplay, although some gamble-aggressive players can make the game annoying with more than 2 people.

RATING: 5
The majority of my Carcasonne play has been two person, vs. my wife.  Granted, this is not where I think the games shines best... but I don't know if I KNOW where the game shines best.  There's a certain sense of accomplishment in finding a really intelligent play, or in finishing a large feature (city, road, etc.)... but this sense of accomplishment is too, too rare in a game where you're mostly just methodically enlarging this and that, turn by turn.

I think there's a lot more to this game than I've seen or realized and I believe there are good reasons for its popularity but I just don't think I'll ever get over the fact that it's so bland and ugly. Sorry Carcassonne!

It is rare to find a game in the hobby gaming realm that I can even get my grandparents to play. I picked Carcassonne up because I had heard it brought up numerous times. I am glad I did and I fully recommend it to anyone. This is a game that you will pick up quickly and enjoy with your friends and family.

One of the best gateway games out there. A good amount of strategy and a little amount of luck make an excellent combination for this game. This game is easy enough to understand that gamers and non-gamers alike will be able to play it right away. The game offers great strategic choices but people can sometimes suffer AP by the end-game.

RATING: 9
After 20+ Plays: Shines best as a 2-player.  I love the tension of when to place farmers.  Too early and you'll lose lots of small scoring opportunities.  To late and your opponent could monopolize a huge field, making all your work pointless.  Best with the first two expansions.

After 50+ Plays: I continue to suggest it and continue to enjoy it - in fact this is one of those classics that I feel I don't get to play enough.

RATING: 5
I avoided this game for a while because I was worried it would bore me. On the contrary, it is quite an entertaining light game. There's enough strategy possible that I would play it several times without losing interest. At the same time it still feels light and is easy to engage new gamers with. Definitely an excellent gateway game.

Place-tiles-place-markers-the-guy-with-majority-on-the-valuable-tiles-at-the-end-wins type of game. It's a very good game, but although I recently re-found it, I still have an issue with the farmers. So much depends on who gets majority in the fields, which causes a hell as the guys there are stuck.

A thinking game that's very easy to teach and changes very much in style between the 2-, 3- 4  etc versions. Very easy to set up as well as keep. I got the Big Box Edition, which is in the end maybe a bit of a waste - I only play with the "Builders and Traders" and "Inns and Cathedrals", the rest seem very lightweight.

RATING: 7.5
I think it's the better true gateway game over Catan. Experienced players are less able to strong-arm new players with bad trades, and it's easier to see the multiple strategies for victory. Showing new players the value of building cities, getting quick points with roads, stacking monasteries to minimize tile investment gets players up to speed with a lot of the mechanics than Catan which only offers negotiation and resource management. Plus, Carcassone offers some more overt 'take-that' by encroaching on opponent cities and sneaking farmers into other players lands. A+ gateway, B+ game.

Easy to learn and fast gameplay. Fairly luck based since you are dependent on the tiles you draw (instance somebody drew pretty much all roads and lost). I would say that replay value is high since the map wont look the same twice, and the added river tiles are nice. Recommended for a fun, fast game.

A classic tile-laying and area control game. Players draw tiles adorned with different features such as cities and roads, then place them onto the ever-expanding board. Features can be claimed using a limited supply of "meeples" and are scored once completed. Easy to learn but with a surprising amount of depth and nuance, it is best played as a two player game.

I don't have any of the multiple expansions (except I&C) that exist for this game (only 2 were out at the time I purchased the base game).

I suspect they might make the game more fun, but haven't had the opportunity yet to try them.

Might change my rating accordingly but as it currently stands, playing the base game is not that much fun for me.

Great Design, Great ideas, but the game takes forever to be played to conclusion.
On the other hand playing time is smoot and fun.

Very nice looking but did not provide a very good feel for the campaign. The SNAFU concept was overly complex and time consuming.  The OCS surprise rule more elegantly provides the same effect, despite the mockery in the designers notes.

This simulation appeals to me.  I particularly like the decision making freedoms given to the operational commanders within the realities of logistics, weather, terrain, time/space and relative strengths/weaknesses of equipment and personnel training factors.  All of these are certainly debatable ad infinitum as well as the luck or "things just go wrong at times" factors that disjoint your perfect plans.  The situation is precariously balanced.  Both Sides will be forced into attack and defense in turn as events on the ground unfold.  The rules are not simple, nor are they overly complex.  There is also a Study Book that gives the Game Designer's thoughts in the whys of the game system.  It is not that the game is perfect, but the framework is all there for one of the best.

Had borrowed this game from a friend to give it a spin, but it was simply far too much work to slog through the rulebook. Even worse, at the end of the day the game didn't quite make sense. No repeating of history with the fast slashing attacks by the German Panzer Corps here, because if you move, you can't attack! And the SNAFU tables add too much randomness for a grand operational game. MMP's A Victory Lost has made this game obsolete.

Very underrated and underappreciated game. A lot of really great ideas in this game, though it is hampered slightly by the rulebook, which can be difficult to navigate.  The system provides players with the freedom to structure his turn to suit his needs, as opposed to a typical 'bombardment phase', 'movement phase', 'combat phase.'  Has a great set of designer's notes.

Can't hold my breath when I took this game.  Manstein plus Kharkov...a perfect wargaming topic and situation in WW2.  Manstein's operational brilliance and the extensive use of tanks in this campaign, a must buy item!!  The rules and the system are somewhat intricate and titanic in execution.  But it's where the fun is in!

Nice system.  Combat is reminiscent of, and only a bit more complex than, that in MMP’s Operational Combat Series.  Supply is simpler, with just rail stations and linked HQs for on-map supply sources.  There are no supply points to track.  The combined arms approach is fairly thorough, but not overly complex.  The Ops Phase (i.e. impulse) systems let’s you choose movement, combat or rally on a unit-by-unit basis that is much more realistic than the traditional move-fight or fight-move sequences.  At this stage in the war (spring 43) it’s probably reasonable that both sides have this flexibility.  Ditto the defender reaction capability.  The third player is of course Field Marshall Mud.  Given some bad rolls he can win, particularly in the short training scenario.  Map and pieces are clear and elegant, typical of the best of GMT's artwork.

I’d say the system is at least as workable and fun as GMT’s  Eastern Front Series.  I’d like to see more games in this presently moribund series.

RATING: 8
An under appreciated Eastern Front game with a unique system that offers good replay value.  Once you wrap your head around movement and combat you're able to see the operational challenges for both sides.  My view is that it is ideal for solitaire play, but teaching someone else might be difficult as they will need to "unlearn" what is common in other game systems.

I play wargames because they are fun. Its enjoyable. This game was not fun. The rules left me with a confused feeling, always thinking "well, what do I do next?" I felt the game ended up playing me more than I played it. Really dissatisfying.

Despite having one of the finest designer's notes ever, I could never get into Lost Victory.  I was only playing solo back then and this game gave me a bad case of gamers ("what do I do now?") block. It felt unfocused - as if it were trying too much into the design.

A bit of old-school wargaming goodness here. The bidding for initiative mechanic dates back to Jack Radey's venerable "Black Sea-Black Death" game and the alternating operations date back to Joe Balkowski's games in the 80's. That said, it is not a rehash of old wargame ideas but is a unique game in its own right.

The Backhand Blow was a masterpiece both in audacity and in obtaining the element of surprise on an operational scale. Sadly, it is very difficult to simulate audacity and surprise in a board wargame which is why there are no good titles (IMHO) on this campaign. Lost Victory does come close but the SNAFU titles (while well intentioned) are overpowered and too random. 

The game also has the misfortune of coming out around the same time as the Gamers' wildly popular OCS series came out and suffered from the constant comparisons to that system. I'm not a fan of OCS, so I will simply say that they both have their strengths and they both have their weaknesses. 

Overall, I think this is a solid (albeit dated) effort and one that deserves to be played at least a couple of times. Of all the Backhand Blow games I have played, this one is probably the best of the bunch.

Rules were a bit quirky and a pain to reference, but everything was hidden in there somewhere.  Player turns had lots of leeway and choices on how to move and fight with a bit of randomness involved in the fights outcome.  Designer notes were great and gave some nice insight to the game and its mechanics.

The winter of 1943 on the Eastern Front was in a delicate balance.  Soviet forces had been pushing the Germans back since Stalingrad and were slowly outrunning their supply lines.  On the other hand German forces were falling back on their supply sources and were looking to form a defensive line to halt the onslaught.  The fighting swirled around the city of Kharkov where Manstein would pull off his famous ‘backhand blow’ and take the advancing Soviets by surprise and force them back.

Lost Victory designed by David James Ritchie and published by GMT gives you control of the forces involved in these battles and lets you see if you can pull of something similar to what Manstein was able to achieve.  The game itself has the usual GMT quality to its components, a nice map and clear counters which pack a lot of information onto them.  The rules aren’t overly complex, there is some chrome especially around combat but apart from this it’s a fairly standard wargame.

Looking at the rules, players bid for the initiative by committing to a number of attacks and overruns they will perform in each of their Ops phases, this goes back and forth until one player refuses to bid.  If a player fails to make the number of attacks they said they would in one of their Ops phases then their opponent becomes the initiative player immediately with no obligation to make any attacks.   With potentially 3 Ops phases in a turn you could find yourself conducting a large number of attacks and wearing your troops down.

Units have combat bonuses like gun bonuses, engineer bonuses, ski bonuses and assault bonuses which provide column shifts to the final combat results.  Also each side must roll on their opponents SNAFU table to see if anything beyond their control  happens in the upcoming combat.  This is the designers’ way of trying to model some of the unknowns that can disrupt the best plans.  Players who dislike randomness may find this difficult to deal with.

The game also contains Ersatz units that are placed on the map as replacements,  and can be absorbed into reduced strength units to bring them up to full strength.  An important part of the game is moving these Ersatz units around to keep your front line troops at full strength.

There are also rules for supply, partisans, penal battalions, revolts, air-strikes and bombardments but overall the game is not very complex.  I enjoyed playing this game, sure random things can go wrong thanks to the SNAFU table but no battlefield commander has perfect control over events or their troops.

A final mention must be made of the 12 pages of designer notes.  These are well worth reading just for the insight into the design process and the ideas the designer was trying to capture.  You may not always agree with his findings, but it certainly helps to make the concepts clearer.

Very different system that might not be worth the trouble. In addition to learning something completely new (not necessarily a bad thing) there are a number of random/table elements that, although they add replay value, may unbalance the game to an extent that the players may have little to do with the outcome [Weather, Bombardment, C3I, SNAFU, Airstrikes, Overruns/Combat].

It might take several playing just to get handle on the bidding which may be more than the average player is willing to invest before everything else comes together.

The Introductory Scenario starts on Turn 3. Do the Turn 1 set-up conditions for Weather, Supply, and Replacements apply? If not, the German are doomed from the outset (out of supply due to Partisans). Such things should have been made very clear.

Yup, too much trouble.

An excellent game!I changed vote, from 9 to 9.5 because more i play it more i like it. I especially love the SNAFU system, it was a great idea as a comander, like in reality, never have the full control of the situation, but i also like column shift concept for artillery complements and dice add bonus for panzer and antitank. Even supply rules are good and i found the game was balanced that few times i played it solo. Now i'm playing Festung Kharkov scenary with a friend, i'm the German, high mobility e powerfull units but only few units available against a lot of Russians units, weakers but so many! The important for the German is the quickly elimination of partisan units from rear lines, sending powerful and motorizated units to avoid partisan to cut supply lines or, in that case, you'll play entire second turn out of supply (with so many limitation on powerfull, mobility and actions you can do). For Russian player, who is in attack,the difficult is coordinate a big attack as with many units of different formation it's very difficult keep comand,controll and coordination. Because of this it is easy planned attack to fail aganst bad SNAFU table (the good for the game is your opponent, not you,choose the units that gets disruption or demage and this makes a big difference!).To say, in first turn with German i planned a big counterattack with many minor formations and LAH panzergranadieren as main and powerfull unit to close a gap in my defense line and to push Russians back out of Donets river but i get out of controll, i can't comand the attack and the result was, due to SNAFU table, one unit crucial no show: my opponent, cleary, choosed my powerfull unit to get disruption, other that can't partecipate at the attack.The result was i can't delete the attack, it had to be started anyway and all other units were eliminated! I also like the reaction system, a chanche for the defense to make a mobile defense at the price of disrupted units.

It's always interesting when a game system fails to ignite.  My reading of the rules would suggest that there is a lot of good design going on here (and the designer's notes are a delightfully vindictive take down of OCS).  It does err on the complex side, and I've reached a point where my hex and counter games need to be streamlined affairs.

Very different from most WWII wargames of this scale.  A lot more freedom for the player to play his turn in a way that's best suited for his specific needs (instead of a more rigid sequence of fixed phases).  Browsing the rulebook was a bit of a problem for my game group though, and in the first few games, there are quite some 'What are we supposed to do now' questions popping up, but that of course, becomes the center of all the fun in later games.

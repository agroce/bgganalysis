A brilliant Mark Herman design that I discovered 25 years too late.

It is chalked full of clever Mark Herman innovations.  Designating units on the offensive and defensive and the hits/ECM charts are excellent.  The operational and strategic maps are another very cool idea.

[b]The game is not impossible.  Do not fear it.  I think this is the best, most clearest rulebook that Great One ever wrote.  It fits together quite cleanly.  You need to play the introduction scenario once, and you'll have your nose in the rulebook a lot, but once you see it in action, it is easy to grasp.[/b]

So why was it 25 years too late?  Because I could have totally played the heck out of this game back in high school.  The intro scenario is pretty short, but the other scenarios could take a lot longer to play, and I had time to burn back then.  Now, family life and work eats up a lot of game time and no matter how much I beg and plead, I can't seem to get people to want to play it with me on Vassal.

I got to play the intro scenario at BGG con.  We bumbled through it, messed up a few rules that we discovered after re-reading the rulebook, but I had a blast exploring the game.  It's not a game that is going to reveal all of its secrets in a play or two.  It deserves to be played over and over and I just can't get that, no matter how much I want to.

The sheer joy I got out of playing what little I did will put this rating at a '9'.  If I ever could get in a game or two and use the operational maps, I really believe this would be a '10.'

Come on, folks.  This is a Mark Herman game.  You know it oozes with awesomeness and it's a miracle that he could cram so much epicness into a box that size.  Give it a chance.  Play it with me...pleeeeaaaaassseee??

This is the type of game in which you plan to play over the course of weeks.  Let me explain.  You need to set this game in a place where it can't be disturbed, get at least two or more players and play for a few hours every Saturday until it's conclusion.  It is immense and lots of fun.  Don't try to run through the whole game on a Saturday afternoon for a few hours.  Take the time to set it up and play. Don't rush yourself.  Interestingly enough,the inventor of the game, Mark Herman is an Executive Vice President of the defense industry consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton.

I bought this game because I'm very interested in Middle East history. I also grew up watching the Iran-Iraq war unfold on my TV, particularly during the period of US intervention in the tanker war. I had always wanted to play out some future conflict in the Middle East using Gulf Strike. The level of detail in the system is incredible. Alas, there's no way anyone will sit down with me to try it out on this unbelievably complex monster. You get tired just setting up the game!

RATING: 6
One of the most compelling "contemporary hypothetical" conflict simulations made.  Covered air, land, and sea warfare and a particularly innovative way; the situation was quite tense given how U.S. forces dribbled their way into theater (via the Time-Phased Force Deployment List/Schedule).  The system has aged quite well and could be used in a number of other situations.  A great accomplishment for the designer.

Way too monstrous for me - but the designer is awesome. He used this game at the Pentegon to help the generals develop the strategy they used in the Gulf War (trus story)! In 1988 Mark added skud missiles to the game - and had a scenario in the game that mirrored the situation when Saddam invaded Kuwait!

A really well researched game.  With the first edition, before Gulf War 1, I actually could trace the units being moved to the gulf on the reinforcement chart.  The air and sea combat is fantastic.  The ground combat is merely okay.  It is the only thing that stops it from being a 10.

Overall, not a bad simulation of 1980s/early 90s warfare in the Gulf Region.  I do not think, however, that it accurately simulated the Kuwait War, as even the Desert Shield expansion did not come with all of the forces the US deployed to the area.  (In particular the units earmarked for the FRG.)  Also, for the life of me, I can't understand with the US counters were RED, while the Soviet counters were YELLOW.  Oddest color scheme I've ever seen....

Love the seamless naval and air combat.  The ground war gets gnarly, but the only game I know that has different states of posture of ground units, which effect movement, combat, and supply.  Love the supply system; best game I know at showing how limited your options are by supply.  Every action has a negative consequence. One problem I have is lack of smaller, yet competitive scenarios.  Basically, to get the full flavor of the game you have to play the longer, more complex scenarios.  An underrated game.

Even after so many years it remains one of the best games (if not the BEST game) on triphibious warfare. Detailed, but incredibly simple on ce you mastered the rules (well written to be honest). The scenario range from actual war operations (Iran-iraq, tanker war, Desert Shield and Storm) to some hypotetical but well grounded ones (Iran attempt to seize the gulf and the cold war fear of a soviet drive to the warm water.

A game that was well marketed to relate with the sign of the times back in the 1980's & early 1990's. Nice packaging, with superb maps & graphics. But really this by no means is a fun game to play, rather it is really so frustrating. But still this game is worth keeping in my collection. This game is far too complicated & far too much time consuming.  Perhaps i can recommend this game for all those who are Persian Gulf/Middle East War enthusiasts. For me playing one game once per year on this is just good enough & bang it goes off to my shelf. I would not recommend this for that many players. By no means is this game entertaining.

If I was to judge this by the rulebook, it would have been a 2, maybe even a 1. This has the most confusing rules organization I've ever seen, and since this is such a difficult game, it's a BIG drawback. If you can learn the system, you end up having a great, very complete and well made system that actually lacks balanced scenarios and a more actual political context. One of the best pre-computer operational games however.

I have the first edition. One of the better wargames on the cold war period. I really like the combined air-sea-land system, and I don't find the system *that* complicated for a wargame. There are a lot of factors but everything is quite intuitive. The last scenario (URSS invades Iran) is a fascinating monster.

On the downside, the scenarios are dated. Also, the game is often decided by the result of the Backfire strike on the US carriers: that's the problem with all 1980-era naval games I suppose. In this respect, the new CAP rules in Aegean Strike completely change the balance of the game.

A combined arms game of the Iran-Iraq War and various scenarios involving the USA and USSR in the Persian Gulf (rather prophetic as it turned out). I played it a few times, but as I converted the hex mapsheet to represent the British Isles for a ECW game I was designing in the late 80s I cannot have thought too much of it.

Now has some rules. Still possibly too big, but at least I can play it now. My impression will undoubtedly change once I rope in another player and give it a whirl.

The underachiever within the history of the hobby, actually fine-grained, complex, and beautiful! Indeed, possibly the best (formerly-) contemporary war title (save the majestic The Next War)

The mechanics of this one struck a chord back in the day and I've long been trying to find a good copy. A couple of solo sessions on the easy scenario show that it hasn't lost its appeal. See my session report here on BGG.
I've yet to try a "big" scenario and PBEM would surely be difficult with this turn sequence. But I certainly do think this one is playable solo with some small adjustments.

Fun game loved it playing with 3 players.. Hated how the game was updated for all sides but Russians.. (Never better than a Mig-23 and how about Su-25's)Used some of 'Aegean Strike's counters...

Still a Blast

Great for air/naval/land interactions if sticking to hypothetic Cold War (the small Horn of Africa scenario). Not as accurate for actual wars fought in the area. 
EDIT: Raised 1p for nostalgia value, as it was my first wargame at all, and I could digest it too! and years later still able to debate and suggest strategies.

I really wanted to like this game, but I found it too complex. There are so many different systems and mechanics, and I found it difficult to understand how they all fit together.  Opponents are really scarce too.

Complexity and detail that VG was known for. Like Aegean Strike, there's a lot going on - all the elements of modern warfare. My copy included the Desert Shield expansion, and got a lot of play from my group. Units range from battalions to divisions, individual ships, and various aircraft formations. The counters are above average looking and pretty busy, so pay attention. The maps are also good and cover the entire area - you won't just be re-fighting the Gulf Wars. Some of the scenarios are a little dated but are still enjoyable (start small). This game will let you get down to the minutiae of modern Air/Land/Sea combat.

I love this system although it is very involved. The general magazine came out with a special Desert Storm scenario for it later on during or after that real life war.

Well-designed system. Playable and realistic to the extent that the campaign game's results usually mirrored those of real life (both Iraqis and Iranians being unable to achieve much due to logistical limitations). Scenarios involving US and USSR forces were interesting, too.

A big overview of this area and a complex system for a global view of the operations. It's a complex but a rewarding game. Today (2010) OB are dated and situation have changed but it's a perfect game to study the possibilities in this area in the 80's-90's.

Got it from a friend at Fort Knox, singed first style box after it survived a house fire.  Kept it up to date with expansion and update from the magazine, and actually used the mapsheet taped to my office wall while stationed in Germany to keep track of where things were going on and trying to sort out what was going to happen next.  Never really played it, but always wanted to.  An operational level game with lots of stuff to work with.

Complex game with naval rule that are a little baffling, but maybe that's just me.  Like U.S. Central Command used this to play out the First Gulf War as the U.S. build up began.

THE game for simulating operational level warfare in the Persian Gulf. The airpower rules are the best I've ever seen. Only drawback is at times the game approaches unplayability in larger (Desert Storm size) scenarios.

Ok, I'm giving this game a '10'.  The best simulation on the topic.  If you have even a passing interest in the subject matter, then you should do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of this wargame.  The situation simulated is dated (the US joining with Iran against the USSR???), but the update(s) bring it up to date as far as the 1991 Gulf War.  It is a rich, detailed study of military strategy and weapon platforms.  Don't pass this one up.  The information you will gain from this simulation is worth the effort.

Man, did Victory Games deliberately work on overcomplicating their games? You'd need a chip build into your head to track the formation changes and changing Zones of Controls. I'm tempted to try to play it, but games like these have been supplanted by computer wargames, in my opinion.

I have the third edition of this game. I always thought the map and counters could have looked a lot better. Despite this the game played OK. 
It's not a game that gets a lot of play time though.

RATING: 9
A fun dice game with a crazy, fun theme and some interesting choices to make. Every game is unpredictable so that I always seem to pick a character whose power is great for the previous game and suboptimal for the current one. It's always fun though!

King of Tokyo without any actual fighting, despite the theme.

Prosta, ale przyjemna, toczy się dosyć szybko i nie jest tak łatwo rozplanować, co się przyda, a na co starczy "gotówki". Rzuty kością mogą nie podejść, jak we wszystkich kościankach, ale niejako wynagradza to opcja kumulacji wyrzuconych na kości wartości, by mieć przewagę w kolejnej rundzie. Grafiki są naprawdę ładne i klimatyczne. Ciekawa jestem, co nowego wprowadzi dodatek.

Great with 2 players, and I think it will be best with that many. Have yet to play with more than 2, and I definitely will, but I predict that 4-5 will have too much downtime as there is little player interaction. There is a lot of replay potential here though! 10 different characters to try (in the Deluxe Edition), and each has 2 ways of playing. Plus you don't play with the entire deck each game, so you get different Spells/Challenges. I look forward to trying a longer game sometime by playing with ALL the Acolytes instead of just 7. I love that there is no hand to manage too!

Sidenote: this was a very smooth Kickstarter process, and the game looks great.

For all the glitz of this Kickstarter, it was very disappointing.  It plays close to solitaire.

11-01-2016 - I thought this game looked adorable for Priscilla, she loves animals.  Played a 4p game at DTC and it was a little flat.  Not bad, but a little flat.  I'm hoping 2p games with P (if we ever get to it) will raise my rating. 5.

Wizards of the Wild is a light dice-rolling, card acquisition game with a few nice twists. Acquiring Spells and completing Challenges is the main aim but a few extra goals such as bribing the Acolytes (referees) and not acquiring the most skulls each round is also important. 

The game blends all of these elements as well as asking the players how far they are prepared to 'pres their luck' as extra rolls brings the risk of extra skulls. 

This the Deluxe Version offers up 4 extra Wizards and a slew of additional Spell and Challenge Cards as well as allowing for a 5th player. 

A nice game and the artwork is perfect for the family market, which is where this title is pitched.

Like the non-deluxe version, but with a few more playable characters.  Really, they should have all been included in the base game.  These are stretch goals gone bad that result in a game that feels incomplete without them.

But I do like the game.

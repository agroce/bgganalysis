A kind of diplomacy game with leaders and army counters. Best works with 7 players but some nations are definitly hard to play (i.e. Austria encircled by all the other European powers). Some nations are underpowered due to their poor rating leaders.

RATING: 8.5
This is the sole remaining heavy wargame in my collection. What makes this game is the diplomacy. Hands down there is no game ever made that makes you feel like a statesman with the full arsenal of tools and weapons at your disposal, all wedded to a massive wargame setting of enduring scope in time and scale. This is truly the struggle of the Napoleonic era (if you have 40+ hours to play a full campaign, and the people to do so because it works only best when you have the full political assembly of nation states duking it out..try and get your hands on the Swedish expansion and look up better naval and foraging rules).

My true rating of this is pending, as I'm currently involved in one game, and looking to begin another.

The game I'm involved in online has included some of the most intense negotiation I've ever had in a game, and we've only just gotten through the setup phase. 

This looks to be the "complete" wargaming experience.

Empires in Arms looks marvelous, simply marvelous. I think I might even be able to understand and play it. The rulebook is intimidation to the nth degree, but if you first read only those sections for individual scenarios, you begin to see how it fits together. Some company–not Decision Games, oh for the love of all things wise and wonderful, don’t let these people get their hands on another classic!–needs to buy the rights and do this think up right (and no, I will not be bothered with “computer” versions, I like to feel cardboard in my tactile hands, than you very much–computer “versions” of classics come from lazy people who want to make money by taking ours and giving us what? ) starting with the map, counters, rules, charts, box—did I miss anything? Probably. A great system with cheap components, and please, oh please!, stop praising the map. It’s only slightly better than those SPI maps of the early-mid-late–did I miss anything?–‘70's. It is a functional map, but nothing to sneeze at, unless you want to blow those counters to kingdom come, and that will be a lot of counters, boy howdy don’t you know. I want to take counters from other games, like Soldier Emperor and La Guerre and use them here. This is a great game waiting for a great company to rescue it from the ashbins of Napoleonic gaming history. Any takers? 

Let me talk--"rant"--a bit more about the incredible weakness in how combat is resolved in the GMT game, The Napoleonic Wars, by looking at what is done in Empires in Arms. In EiA, the attacker and the defender secretly select a combat tactic. The defender has a choice of six tactics, the attacker five. The chit choices are then compared on the Operational Possibilities Chart and cross referenced to the Combat Resolution Chart. The die roll is modified by terrain or commander ratings. When the roll is made, the CRC shows the casualty and morale effects. The casualty results are determined by the number of factors in the opposing side. A battle can last until one side withdrawls, is wiped-out, or has its morale broken. 

The Napoleonic Wars does not come anywhere close to simulating combat in the Napoleonic Age. EiA makes a superior effort by comparison, and it is not the only strategic-level campaign game to better TNW in this area. Why play a strategic Napoleonic game if you cannot simulate combat in an historical manner faithful to Napoleon and his times? As has been said before, "If you want to play Diplomacy, play Diplomacy." 

In EiA, you have your country's army Corps counters on the board, but the strength of each Corps remains "hidden."  On your country's play sheet, you can use generic strength point counters from 1 to 25 (it depends on the strength limitations of your Corps) to keep track of each individual Corps's strength.  This is a bit of a housekeeping pain, but I am not sure how it could be improved.  In an OSG game, your unit would have a box with numbers from say 1 to whatever, and you use just one counter (moving it up or down and your strength increases or decreases)to keep track of your Corps' SP's.  I might have to make my own version of such a play-aid.

The game is an ambitious project and has some aspects that are worth of note and great. The military campaign are extremely interesting, as the battle resolution system. What is completely out of target is the non military part.
Diplomacy can turn the game in a joke: historically was France versus everybody. Here usually is not.
Another problem is that is nearly impossible to simulate in a multiplayer game the long stalled period some nations had. For example, Prussian did almost nothing in the period 1807-1812. Austria had some years of stasis. Now I have still to see a player that think it would be better for him to stay out of the fight for 60 turns while the other fight on.
I played three campaigns and I think just the very napoleonic die hards could endure so long playing time and the problem this system has. The vote reflect my desire to play it again.

One of the last "Mosters" in my collection.  If only you could find people dedicated to playing this.  It takes a LONG LONG LONG time but it's well worth it.

Repurchased a copy for $3.00 in a little thrift store in the mountains.

RATING: 8
This is a wide scoped look at the Napoleonic wars and a refeshingly brilliant game. Even though its become middle aged (20 plus years old..) and its rule book looks like a slice of minutia there is a serious "wow- factor" to playing this complex and this well done celebration of the powers that be behind the Napoleonic Wars.

The rule book will be off-putting to many many geeks, however an experienced player that knows it well, can take a novice through a scenario in a leisurely paced afternoon.  (I would suggest a scenario vs. trying to play the campaign game)  I would suggest scenarios where each player could tackle a couple of different countries before remotely taking on a campaign game.

Scenarios are many and give a player the essence of combat choices and moving forces around.  This comfort in developing supply and movement and in developing good habits in chit selection...orplanning good spots to choose battles can not be underestimated.  Scenarios also move players through various parts of the map of educating them about various hot points at various points in the wars.  


Any wargamer would most likely love this game and maybe even history buffs however I don't beleive that many would ever have the luxury of playing it.  Many gamers might have trouble in trying to have seven friends be willing to help each other learn it, play it, and then how many are actually willing to take the time away from their families and other interests to play a game of this magnitude.

There are some rules that are essential and it is crucial to define what the designers goal or intent was.  If those rules create balance or are there to work in a certain way my opinion is that there needs to be a delegate judge which will have the final say on weather or not the rule is being implements in the psirit of what that rules is truly intended to bring to the games outcome.  Especially in the areas of balance it is important. 

I believe to truly experience this game at its best it is extremely important to look at what a rules intent was for the game.  There are some crucial rules to use in order to balance the game more effectively.  Playing the first time I really believe that a good teacher would review what had happened over the last year and go through the various mistakes that each country made and how the game is more ideally played. This is especially important in diplomacy and hugely important preparing to consolidate forces so that precious time is not squandered. 




When you are spending (sacrificing) so very many hours in order to learn a game it is absolutely crucial to make the learning of it not something that can only happen over several plays.  That is a luxury that working individulars simply can not afford.  The true scholar is going to need many reviews of the rules...a great teacher then is going to point out weak ideas in moves...weak positions...weak responses to various threats...goals that would affect various countries VP engines.



In summary, this is a totally cool game.  This is another game worth playing partially vs playing other games in total.  


Regardless of stacks combat can totally hinge on dice rolls (sorry...) and leadership to corps ratio.  

Thanks to Perfalbion for teaching me the basics.




I do not intend to play this game again until I am traveling to Europe or at least achieving other goals that I have had since I was in my early teens.

I sold mine on ebay, but I'll help you play with yours (I'd even be Turkey!)  :)  Too difficult to find 6 opponents who want to give up one night a week for the rest of their lives to play and then teach them how to play.  The scenarios are awful fiddly and annoying.  War & Peace by Avalon Hill is a little more user friendly - lends itself better to two players - and a scenario can be played easily in an hour or so.

RATING: 4
What can I say? Fascinating game, but much too hard to play in reality, even if the length obstacles can be overcome. A single player who makes a significant mistake can throw the whole thing into total chaos (and in this case, that&#039;s not good). If everyone doesn&#039;t play the game the &quot;way it&#039;s supposed to be played&quot;, things get badly degenerate. Also, horrendous downtime problems as the game screeches to a halt for uninvolved parties once a war starts, and players playing lesser powers can have literally nothing to do for entire sessions at a time. The free-form 1792 scenario is no improvement; if you want to play diplomacy, play diplomacy - you have no need of the detailed battle and economic system in Empires in Arms, which become almost superflous in the 1792 version. A game that should perhaps have achieved greatness, and maybe in some academic sense has, but the truth is that the reality is not there. I&#039;ve played campaign games twice and neither was quite satisfactory. Oh, and you also have to find some sucker to play Turkey.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Immersive seven-player campaign of alliances and treachery and a (in it's day) unique, chit-based battle system.

It manages something extraordinary, a game in which a player can work from their political objective, with an economic element, to determine a military objective to inform a tactical choice. Having those layers, and that freedom, can produce things which look very different from the Napoleonic Wars, but the decision space - the interplay of political necessity and military reality - was unequalled for a long time. Maybe something like Here I Stand now comes close. Maybe.

We played a 7-player face to face game every Sunday through one summer where every player was required to wear the appropriate hat for their country. A majestic game and a ground-breaking experience.

I have now played this game four times - each playing is about 160 hours. It really needs seven players to work at its best as the political elements of the game are the most interesting.

It is the finest game that I have ever played and the playing was the finest gaming experience I have ever encountered.

We played each Saturday for 6 months, starting at 1:00 pm and going through to about 8:00 pm. During the week we would tend to spend about 3 hours on the phone negotiating.

Possibly one of the greatest multiplayer monstergames- EVER.  Not for the timid.  Don't believe the 100 hour playing time- you will need MONTHS to bring this monster to conclusion.  While elements of it can be gamey, when played with people who truly get into their roles the diplomacy takes over your life. My personal advice for the modern age is to not allow Diplomacy to occur on actual game nights.  Do it by email (Better, do it by LETTER!!) and spend the time playing, playing.

One of the ONLY monstergames where if I could find at least 4 other people to play, I would make room in  my life (and my apartment) to play.

If its not fighting a war every year, its wasting serfs. :-)

I don't get to play this very often. It really requires multi-player play to make it interesting and the daunting rulebook, the size of the map(s), and the complexity of the economics and diplomacy all work together to make it difficult to recruit a critical mass of players. 

But when one DOES get a commitment and when a group DOES struggle through the (usually) several game days of playing time, one really has a sense of what was happening in that era. History is laid out before one and it is easy to get caught up in it.

Read the rules of Empires in Arms. Played a few turns. Very interesting war game, but diplomacy isn't my strong suit which has a lot in this game.

Not something I plan to play any time soon. A whole game could take a whole year to play.

In theory is the best wargame multiplayer ever. Played on the board shows its flaws. If played not "roleplaying" the commander in chief of your nation, and having in mind only to gain Political Points and avoid their losses to maximize the chances to win,  the game invariably turns toward the grotesque. It is better for example maneuver to lose a war as soon as possible, and possibly against against all opponents at once, than try to continue it longer.

Long have I purged this game from memory. Had potential in the 1980s for me when time was not an issue but now is simply impractical to play. Suffers from all the problems of most Napoleonic games which were not even marginally dealt with by the game, such as uneven powers and uneven downtime.

Need to rewrite this, because every session I play, I like it more.  This is really a fantastic game, with only one significant drawback - the rules are just terrifying.  There are so many little things to know, and the book doesn't help you learn them or even look them up.  Supply, in particular, is monstrous.  If you have one player who can cite all the rules from memory, your game will be so much smoother.

To like is simply everything else.  This game is spoiling other games for me, because the scope and pace are sublime.  Sure, it's long - but that makes it more rewarding and thematic.  What it has really taught me is that a good negotiation game needs to have a structural basis for negotiation.  Too many games just throw themselves out there and say, 'now go negotiate'.  This game has tons of things which can be bought and sold, but the separate peace rules and fixed surrender term options are the real solid gold nugget.  This game allows you to plot against your allies and work with your enemies.  It's devious without being gratuitously stabby, and works as a wargame or a strategy game, however you like to play.

If we ever finish our current game, I'll flesh out the rest.  It may be that any game with seven committed players with 1000 hours to devote would have to be interesting.  Fortunately, EiA has constant difficult decisions, unscripted opportunism, emergent alliances of various lengths, unintended consequences, and the chance to employ multiple personality management techniques.  Too long?  Bah.  It's going faster than I want it to.  Besides, if anything is 'too long for what it is', it's war.  It is hard to get people together and complete a game yes, but I see no reason to blame the game for that.

That the game provides enough creative breadth that it can become ahistorical - thank god!  A strength, not a weakness - not missing tyrannical CDG mechanics at all.

This one's for my retirement: long and complicated.  But with the right people, it is the near perfect game for the genre.  Excellent combat system.  Uncontrolled major powers don't work so well and do make an effort of sticking to history just a bit; silly alliances don't seem to fit in with the game.
Come to think of it, by the time I actually go through all the rules and have played a few games to make a better informed judgement, I may reach retirement...

   Needs serious supply rules reworking.  The Supply mechanics can be 'gamed' by experienced players for strange effects.  The diplomacy rules also need revision to avoid the 'one enemy at a time' easy France win situation.  Be prepared to require a large table and the room to keep the game in place over a number of days.

RATING: 7
This is an entertaining monster.  If you can convince at least five people to sit down for enough sessions to play a campaign, the constant negotiation and bluster can be a real gas.  Each major power's strengths and weaknesses, and access to territorial conquest, is modeled with enough differentiation to make the choice of which to play a serious one.  The land combat system, with its tactic chit pull, is gamey as all get out, but an entertaining exercise in guessing what your opponent is likely to do.  One of my fonder gaming memories is playing as the Turks and turning back combined Russian and Austrian forces by pulling off the correct chit time after time.  My opponent's red face was a particularly great reward.
     All that said, however, there are some major weaknesses to this game.  First off, the naval combat system is not very detailed and offers very little opportunity to pull off the kind of upset you can on land.  Unless the British player turns everyone against him / her, the French are pretty well bottled up for the duration.  Secondly, with fewer than five players the campaigns start to lose their interest - either too many players control blocks of major powers, freezing the political side of things, or there are uncontrolled major powers that only function half-cocked.  Finally, even with everybody at the table, it can be awfully hard to convince Russia, Prussia, and / or Turkey that their long term interest is NOT to instantly disassemble the Austrians.
     Overall, however, if you have a dedicated gaming group that enjoys the role-playing element of EiA politics, you could do a lot worse.

Incredible game.  This fixes the things I disliked about diplomacy by adding enough structure to avoid the random backstabbing and bizarre situations.  The game has some poorly drafted rules and some historical problems, but this is truly a uniquely fun gaming experience everyone should try at least once.  The rules are a lot more simple than they look and the combination of economics/wargame/diplomacy is pretty incredible.  I'll probably do a review of some sort in the future.  

A reprint is rumored, but occasionally you can get a copy cheap on ebay.  I payed under $35 with a paypal coupon.

A fine tuned Diplomaic-Wargame. 7 major power (actually only got 5) dance from 1805 to 1815 you have the freedom to choice partner and enemies.

Each player collect tax from the provinces they control during seasonal turn and spend the money on building army or fleet. The most interesting system of the game is the battle system, when armies from 2 major power that is at war come within a place, battle happened, both player selected a combat chit as their army formation, then both reveal their chit at same time. different combo of chits got different favor, of course some chit need used by a good leader. On the time of resovling battles, the excitment really make people crazy.

Personally, My once and the only time be the France major power won the game with total 38 field battles fought, the result is 1 lose(lead by Massena), 7 draw, 30 win. I remember 1 big battle  my Out-Flank vs Defend chit, 2nd Round out-flank force arrived, commited 2level guards break the allied army with Murat roll a "6" on pursuit die roll........

The bidding system seems be good, however I don't have a game with a Russian need under 7 pts for each seasonal turn to win.(They always bidded around at 7.5 pts, it doesn't make sense!!) Another issue, whenever a major power in no hope of win the game, and at that moment can't be sure who will win the game. The loser will be in very odd mud.

Anyway this is 9 rating game, as long as enough players for a game, I will be one of them.

One of the best wargames ever made: top 3. With the right group of 7 committed and strong wargamers (not Dip players!), a fantastic gaming way of life experience. EPIC. Nothing like it in the hobby. Played over a decade in Don Peterson's fabulous EiA group (cries of "2 corps Chau" still echo) in the Twin Cities; many great games and memories. Hadn't played in almost 15 years, but recently got a new group going (EiA Sawatdee - see our numerous sessions reports & blog here on BGG). EiA is still as good as I remember it two decades ago.

Mr.Rowland's modeling of battles produces more gut wrenching decisions than any wargame I know of. Add to that the way campaigning/operational system works (supply, political considerations, etc) and you have a game unequalled in the hobby. Yes, it is outdated you go I go and you can't muck with me old school, but, it models the dance of armies well.

Still state of the art poly, econ, mil integration after being published 30 years ago.

As a wargamer, you need to play this at least once or you will likely be denied entry to the big wargaming club in sky :-)

It's a huge Napoleonic Strategy game that is playable given enough players at least for a few years of 'game time'.

And the VP / surrender options lead to some very gamey DoWs and short wars.

Oh how I love this game!  One of the things I love about the Napoleonic period is the fluidity of diplomatic relations (especially compared to WW2), and EiA does it well.  You can kick the tar out of someone on the battlefield in March, go to peace with them in May, sign an alliance with them in June... then in July, when your other (real) friend comes around to kick the tar out of the first guy, you just sit back and watch.

It's a shame this doesn't get played anymore.  The guy who taught my group played France and abused his experience and rules knowledge to crush everyone.  I'm the only other one of that group who hasn't cursed the game.

Yawn. In principle I like wargames about the Napoleonic Wars in Europe, but this game is just too long, too fiddly and too complex, not to mention too random. Did I say &quot;too long&quot;? Sure, if you are Prussia and you&#039;ve just been defeated by France you might not be out of the game, but by golly, you would wish you were! That is, unless you actually like sitting around for the next 20 hours twiddling your thumbs, waiting for a time where you will be able to do something again. Not recommended if you or any of the other players have a life. ;)

Best blend of tactical and strategic I've seen in a wargame. Individual battles can easily turn the tide of a war and affect strategic decisions. Downside: it is best with 6 or 7 players, and it takes a long time to play. Plus the map is big, but still not big enough to adequately hold all the counters. (I've played on a larger map, mounted on styrofoam, and hung on a wall. We used pins to hold the counters. Much easier to play that way.)

Interesting mix of strategic and operational scale (it explicitly models supply, with depots which are placed on the map). Interesting land combat system.

A flawed masterpiece. So many elements of this game are so wonderful from the movement and battle systems to the production elements to the diplomatic maneuvering.  However, after several playings I came to realize that there were certain fundamental problems in the political mechanisms that led to ahistorical results and greatly diminished my enjoyment of the game.  The chief amongst these was the fact when played amongst rationale, experienced players wars hardly ever lasted more than a single turn since the least powerful player would immediately surrender rather than having his army destroyed prior to having to surrender. I always wished that ADG would have continued to improve EIA as they did with World in Flames, perhaps coming out with a set of political rules and victory conditions which would more accurately depict the internal political pressures which dictated the actions of the European powers.  Of course, even if someone did come up with such rules, I'm not sure whether I could now find the time or the players to give EIA another go.

Awesome with all 7 players, maybe a wee bit long playing. My best memory is playing the Ottomans and allying with France. In a war I was helping the French with in Russia I sensed the French were using me as a distraction only to gain surrender terms to their advantage (I guess one should expect that!) I secretly negotiated a surrender deal with the Russians where they would surrender to my Ottomans before the French giving me the needed push to major power status! The French player was in shock :-)

In complete contrast there was the time I lost the Old Guard on a ship in the English Channel...  :-(

I played this game 4 to 5 times. 
I had an experience want to share. I was Rus and I was the supreme commander of Ailled where we had a very good chance to break the Armee on the field. I selected Cordon and then went to piss (could not wait...), when I was back, I saw one teammate had his cigarette outside of the room. "What's up?" I said. He replied "Fra opens his chit, it's Outflank. So I go outside and need to cold down." It's great, I thought and went back to my seat within a second, then asked the Fra why he needed to split force. "You have a chit of Defend, I'm sorry." the Fra player smiled. "Yes, we change the chit" Aus player confirmed with tears dropped. I wanted to cry as well.

Fascinating how one can convolute a rulebook to make it more complicated than the rules in it.   A horror.  Game seems to be OK if you manage to avoid stupid players which in a 7-man group is difficult.  As a result seems to run off course easily.

The more I think of it, the more I like this game. Suddenly reminded me of belonging to the Austrian delegation at the European Union summit, discussing a European Treaty on transports through the Alps. 

Folks, do not do this at home!!! You start at 07:00 in the morning. You are fresh. So is your enemy, the others! They have the same ability as you have to drink coffee. They will last long. After 01:00 the next night you will suddenly have an opportunity to strike down the enemy - do it!

Great game. 1000s of hours of fun, treachery and military consequences.Very good rules. The multiplayer diplomacy nature will always challenge even experienced players. You will in time discover problems with the original game (armies tend to grow huge, without a good mechanism in the game to limit them). So you'll probably need some of the several good house rules on the net. With these fixes... it's a 10!

Sorry but this game is outdated and way too long for what it is. I get that people love this game, but really? 2 years to play the campaign if you meet about once a month? WTF
I hear poeple telling me how open ended it is, but then they go ahead and give me the rundown on what usually happens in a game, so not so open ended after all.
Just play HiS or VQ to get the same feeling in 1/1000000 of the time.
And the battle chit resolution/die roll/table look up is ridiculously long and tedious. There isn't even a restriction on whihc chits you can play based on terrain or flanking or anything, so it's completely random and yet poeple are staring at the chits and the charts for minutes, then there's a die roll that can completely affect your choice. I'm sorry but I don't have time for that crap.

The game is well done, the system works rather well and the diplomatic part is interesting. Managing a country during the Napoleonic Wars is a fascinating exercise.

The drawback is the length of the game (but a shorter game would probably take away some of the richness of the diplomatic game, which is partly a consequence of the long term perspective you have to take). There is a lot of downtime, especially for the smaller powers, and especially if you're playing by the VP chart (see below). Sometimes you're so desperate to do something that you start a war for the sake of it. And in the time needed for a whole game of EiA, you could probably play 20 shorter multiplayer games.

A deeper problem is the victory conditions. In my view, the game breaks down on the game theory point of view. If you want to win you must play by the VP chart, but if you do, the game will be boring. The game can be modelized as a game of "Snakes and Ladders" played on the VP chart, but the Snakes and the Ladders are the geopolitical events taking place on the map (battles, sieges, alliances, etc). A naive player analyzes the geopolitical situation on the map, a gamer analyzes the mathematical situation on the VP chart. The discrepancy between a naive, "geopolitical" strategy and "VP-chart" strategy leads to all sorts of problems which it would be too long to discuss here (for example, it rarely makes sense to fight because it's extremely risky, due to the randomness of the combat system - if you're attacked by France you should surrender immediately - etc..). But if the players are naive enough, or have a very low risk-aversion, it can work. To mitigate this problem somewhat I recommend playing without economic manipulation (the less players look at the VP chart the better)

This is a very involved game and lots of bookkeeping... and it requires a lot of players!  Since this is usually hard to do, this game sits.

How many games do you remember after 10, 15, 20 years? That's individual games..? EiA is the most engrossing multi-player game I have ever experienced. WiF comes close, but I fondly remember every game of Empires I have played, winning or losing.
When Avalon Hill went out of business there was ONE game I went and bought a "spare" copy of. Guess which one? It's still in shrink, and "No, it's not for sale or trade!".
People criticise this game's length: its length is the whole point! It is criticised for the downtime- but there's always something fascinating happening! It is imbalanced: yes! The chits wear out: ok, make new ones. The map's enormous: yes, laminate it like I did and you can draw the boundaries for Poland with a whiteboard marker...

Great "grand Napoleonic" game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
A strong theme, a dense rule set, and a loooong time to play.  However, this is hands down my favorite marathon game to play.  EiA captures much of the flavor of the Napoleonic period well, and provides for a very interesting set of mechanics to bring the period to life.  The scenarios work well for a limited number of players, but to me the only way to go is find seven dedicated individuals and go with the Grand Campaign.  Get the right people and it's going to be a very good time (over many, many gaming sessions).

That's not to say there aren't flaws.  AH's editing problems are pretty rampant in some rules, so it's important to get a group together that isn't going to lawyer the game to death.  You also need to accept that the starting positions and game structures flat out aren't balanced and that very few powers in the game really have significant control over their own destiny.  Finally, if you don't do diplomacy well, this isn't going to be your game.  You're unlikely to win without knifing someone in the back at least once, and that means you need to have skin thick enough to cope with it when it happens to you (which it probably will).

But if you've got seven interested, reasonable, and invested players looking for a monster to take on, this is the game for you.

Played this game for a few campaigns while an university student. The diplomacy here has the power to warp your daily life, and affect your relationships.. these campaigns are long and involved.

Sadly, the base system is actually unbalanced, and would need house rules to fix it, but you can only see that and take advantage of it after a few hundred hours of play over a couple years, so it might not matter.

RATING: 9
This is a '9' for me, but I am fairly certain that it will not be a '9' for you. It's more than a game, it's a way of life! I think about this game more than almost any other game and it's the one I have looked forward to playing the most. That qualifies it for a 9, even if it's not a 'perfect game'. Not only is it not a perfect game, I would go so far as to say it is awkward and flawed (which is why it doesn't qualify as a '10'), but the story underneath all of those layers of rules and logic and ambiguity is genius. There was a time that I gave this game a '10', but it's been a year since our multi-year campaign has ended and in that time reflecting back on the experience, it doesn't hold up with that number, so it's now a '9'.

If you feel that games played in one sitting are lacking depth, if you want the perfect mix of war gaming and diplomacy, if you want to live the game that you are playing, always hungry for more, then this is THE game, the one.

At first, the rules are daunting (ok, that's an understatement, it felt like I was studying for a test), but observing a few sessions and a complete read through a few times is eye-opening. I now have a binder for Empire in Arms, full of rules, reference sheets, maps, strategy article, and all my notes.

BGG lists Empires in Arms as 100 hours long. I don't think you can finish an Empires in Arms games that quickly. Perhaps 300-400 hours? The game we played took five years. Yes, FIVE years. We played one Sunday a month.

We played the campaigns with 7 players in max 50h. So while the game is long, I think you really have to play slow to get 6000 mins. The game is brilliant in some parts.

Well, I think world needs a game like this, so I hope something similar could be done with modern design.

Not sure what to make of this game.  The diplomacy aspect is the most appealing part of it (it is much more structured than in Diplomacy), but the combat system seems just a bit... tedious and boring.  I'm also a bit puzzled by the "minor country free for all" that happens early in most games, since I don't think things happened quite this way in real history.  Of course, IIRC, there are rules in the game to keep things more historical, but then all you're left with are the drudgerous game mechanics.  To be fair, it is rather interesting to see entire military campaigns unfold before your eyes (well, OK, I find it interesting, maybe not everyone), so the awkward combat resolution may be a price worth paying.

Some of the best memories of multi-player wargaming are with this semester erasing game, where my Prussians could not be erased from competition. The French would have walked all over Europe if it were not for the stalwart Prussian Troops. 

Several 1805 start campaigns under my belt as Full Player games. I have always looked on these commitments as amongst the best of my gaming career.

A very heavy strategy game, just up my alley. But I need to get my friends on the wagon and it takes just a bit too long to play to get them interested.

Great balance and dynamics, with changing alliances and wars. Very good for players that like a good war simulation.

¿200 horas por partida? ¿7 jugadores? ¿Reglas numantinas? ¿Diplomacia despiadada de puñaladas? ¿Anodino mapa de papel de 1m2 y fichitas antiestéticas? ¿Reglamento típicamente rebasado de los años 80? ¿Estamos locos?

Only once did I gather four others for a game, and they had only stamina for a couple of turns - which speaks volumes about the weakness of this game. It is a true multi-player game, solitaire just won't do - but the lenght of the game makes it very difficult to find players.

So, anyhow, I have solitaired a few games where I picked a country and thought - let's change history. Economy-wise and politically, the game is excellent, but I don't really like the combat system - the picking of a chit is too random. (Yes, I know,you choose a chit unbeknownst to the opponent). But Napoleon picking a chit unfavorble to him, and he looses the battle - because he has no way of knowing what chit the other plaeruses. Realistic, perhaps, but the impact of the rando element in the tactial chit system is simply too great - I would prefer a tactical "play the battle out" option, although I could just then merge it with another wargame... Hm.

Impossible to rate it since I have not really, in the game's own sense, played it, only toyed with a multitude of situations.

At Consimworld, they have a folder for "Valiant Failures"--games that you really wish worked and that you really like in some ways, but that don't work.

Empires in Arms is a valiant failure.  Very interesting game, undone by a completely unworkable political system which encourages immediate surrender as the least-bad option for a weak nation which is attacked.  In the two campaigns I played, the game quickly veered from an interesting wargame into "Diplomacy with accounting", which even so overstates the interest level because at least in Diplomacy you have tactical considerations.

If someone did a total overhaul of the political/VP system and I had a few months of my life to play the game, I'd love to try it again.

I love this grand scale Napoleonics game from ADG, developed further and produced by Avalon Hill.  This will literally take you likely a year of your time to finish via a weekly schedule, and the farthest I've gotten is 1810, from a start time of 1805, despite around 5+ games under my belt.  (We always ended for one reason or another).  What makes this game extremely enjoyable for me, besides the subject matter, is the highly engaging diplomacy and the very enjoyable combat mechanics.  Outguessing what your opponent did on the combat matrix is very satisfying, and most times rewarding!  Being outguessed, as expected, reveals the exact opposite values - namely frustration and punishment!  Its a very social game and it shows, if you can get a group of people to commit to it on a weekly or bi-weekly schedule for a huge chunk of their time.

Outdated classic. It's more a mathematical exercise than a historical simulation.

Rating based on a seven players game where Fog of War rules were not used. I guess the game doesn't work at all without FoW (it becomes a mathematical exercise instead of the strategic/operational bluffing game it was meant to be).

A magnificent game, the full campaign is stupendous. Great mechanisms keep the game balanced.

il migliore gioco napoleonico in commercio! anche se la componentistica é a dir poco obsoleta e "fatiscente", le meccaniche di gioco sono SPETTACOLARI....

impareggiabile...

One of my favorites.  I laminated the map, mounted it on a cork board, and use a putty-like substance to hold the counters on the map.  Allows for long-term storage, improved vision of and access to the map, and easier play once you get used to using the putty.  House rules are a necessity for the ambiguous areas of the rules.

RATING: 7
I've played a year and a half of the campaign game of this, before our group lost interest after around around 40 hours of gameplay and three quarters of year in monthly sessions.  Although there were some glimmers of hope early on that this may be worth the time, I'm not likely to make the effort unless I have a group that knows the game inside and out.  The game is certainly unique, but the rules weight slowed our sessions down with consistent lookups.  My game tastes run to long games, but this is just too long.  Still, I got 40 hours of gameplay out of it, which is much more time than I've spent playing most of my other games.

A very nice wargame/grand strategy game. This game depicts in a very accurate way Napoleonic warfare and has many aspects of war/economy/diplomacy covered.  Unfortunately, due to the immense complexity of the rules I can't find anyone to play it with. I've played it 3 or 4 times and my gaming group quickly got fed up with it. Although I adore it, I still look at it in my collection with wishful thinking. Also another minus for me is the quality of the production. The map now is 10 years old and showing it. The chips are starting to get worn in the sides despite my not using them very often. All in all, an excellent wargame for those who are interested in detailed and complicated games.

The definitive treatment of nations at war during the Napoleonic era.  Probably the best "Monster Game" on the subject.  The 2-player scenario can be played in a few hours.  The 7 player diplomacy game will take over 100.  Hard to find and expensive if you do, but worth it.  I have the ADG version which I personally like the map better than the AH version.

EiA is the most addictive game I have ever played. After getting my butt kicked when I played France, and getting stomped by France at the beginning of a game in which I was playing Britain, I then moved away from the gaming groups in the Los Angeles area about 12 game months into that second game.  I experienced heavy withdrawal symptoms for the next 18 years or so!

This game has some flaws in terms of history and some aspects of game design, especially with respect to Turkey and North Africa.  However, as a role playing game of long duration, this game rocks!  Different player personalities are better for different countries in this game, especially depending on how aggressive one wants to be.  But if seven players get together with the necessary dedication for a long role playing game with military and diplomatic strategy at the fore, then there is nothing to compare with this game experience.

Have been playing another face to face game since about March of 2010. Finally bumped my rating back up to 10. That is not because this is a perfect game. It certainly has problems with play balance, fun balance, lack of historical objectives, wierdness in Turkey and North Africa, etc. But I crave playing this game. I have absolutely no hesitation giving this game priority over playing other games, and over many other activities. It's just a blast to play, especially with 7 other competitive and tricky players.

Why not a 10?  Finding time and players is the problem.

A classic. Someone must dig this one out of the cellar. 

We played this May 2010. Some thought it had a lot of bookkeeping involved.My thoughts are that the battle system is great (but takes some time), but the diplomatic system less so. It should have benefited from an easier battle system for smaller engagements. A distinct negative is the sitting out factor which of course is both historical and prevalent in Napoleonic campaign games. But sitting out 18 months in this game (due to an enforced peace) is hardly entertaining.

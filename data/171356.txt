All of us liked the game right off.  This one will be a keeper in the collection, as it is a wonderful portrayal of the story of the Argonauts.  So far we've only tried it on Hard and we've lost all three times.  Perhaps Normal next time.  =)

Initially backed on Kickstarter, but decided with my gaming group, it would never really get played more than once. Art looked pretty, but game play does not seem enticing. May pick it up at retail.

love the movie, love the legend, love the game, will use the mechanics to use figures and terrain as well as a demo game. The game play in itself is quite detailed in terms of strategies, you can drill down to the basic mechanic, don't starve, don't sink but the theme allows the game to grow. Have incorporated some house rules, which by personal choice makes the game flow better and gives it a better "edge".

This game is marred by a bad rulebook but overall it is a nice game once you get the hang of it. The hero rotation is nice and novel and i do not recall something similar in any games that i have played. I like the quick setup time and the length of the game. Nice artwork and good price. The game is very true to the Argonauts myth. It might have issues with replayability a few games later.

This game is incredibly random, almost but just on the edge of it being a problem. The amount of different cards in the Argo Events deck, that you can defeat Encounters two different ways and the random distribution of the heroes in squads give the game enormous variation. It's fun to see what happens next, and whether your heroes can deal with it.

Purchased largely based on the art, which is fantastic. The gameplay works and offers a diverting time, but doesn't really offer anything new among a shelf of similar games. The fixed nature of the encounters means you can get better by memorization, as opposed to tactical choices during play.

This is a beautiful game. Kickstarted and received in 2015, the components are top notch. A lovely mounted board and cards with fantastic art. This game looks wonderful on the table. Gameplay takes the Argo and its crew on a point-to-point journey to retrieve the fleece and return it to Iolkis, with the Argonauts having encounters and making landfall at different places along the way, and having the Legendary Encounters with foes that are well-known if you have seen the famous film.  This game is a fitting homage to the myth of Jason and the golden fleece.

Absolutely stunning looking game, yet to play it properly but initial rules read through and some play tests are promising.

Love the theme and production of it (a KS game!)

RATING: 6
High standard production, and some nice mechanics in there (like for instance the exhausting & resting), but why making these encounters & effects so random (a D12 roll) ? The different actions to take in towns could also have been a bit more diverse. All in all, halfway the game it began to feel too repetitive for me. So I question the replayabilty a bit.

looks pretty, but....  can be seduced?  what's with that?  and there are curses?  also looks like some of the female charac's may be on the inappropriate side - wait to see final art (hopefully they fixed that).  Finally, the prototype video - looks like the capitalized gods - not sure why they'd do that - hope that was corrected in final version, too.  wait and see

LOVE the theme in this one. Really neat co-op with an engaging story (at least for me). It looks like it might be a one-off if the game play is too easy. After looking over the rules, it looks like it's gonna be a nice challenge.

Super ultra beautiful with terrific production quality, but lacking instructions sink this clever game. Turn order is explained, but the ramifications of different card types and how to resolve them are unclear and strewn throughout the book. Unfortunately, it seems the issue actually extends to some of the encounter cards missing information or being unclear.

This game is lovely enough that I'll try one internet rules fix before giving up entirely, but I'm skeptical.

Art is beautiful. This one doesn't work for me as a solo game as it requires me to play all 4 hands, which I don't enjoy. Most likely going to end up trading this one.

A co-op game in which Jason and the Argonauts sail the Mediterranean looking for loot, trying to best mythical creatures, and dying (or maybe that was just me). Each player controls heroes that participated in the Argonaut campaign (Hercules included), each with their own set of skills and special abilities.

I've enjoyed this more each time I've played it.  There is an interesting "economy" to managing your squad.  And I have a little extra love for well done Kickstarters that actually deliver a good product.

Got this from Kickstarter, as one of the designers is a friend. The game’s story and feeling is actually super close to the original myth, which is both a boon and a flaw. As I’ve read the story many times as a kid, I was happy to see familiar places, foes and allies, feeling that I’m part of the adventure. At the same time, the game is very railroaded to succeed in being accurate, meaning the choices you make are limited. It is salvaged by its cooperative mechanics and the replayability of having different crew cards available in each game. It’s best with 4, though.

First of all, I love the artwork of this game. It's absolutely great! Apart from that, the gameplay is also very intriguing and the drafting of the heroes makes you think always what is the best choice based on the facts that you have about the game. I have played it 3 times so far, only as solo and I liked it very much, especially since the difficulty is not low in order to win (2 losses, 1 win for me). I think that it depends a lot on the heroes that you are going to get if you will be able to win or not as well as the formation of the 4 squads. If there is a certain variation on the skills in each squad, you have a good chance. The only disadvantages for me are that some heroes are very powerful whereas some others are almost useless and that I would like more Argo event cards, exploration cards and Legendary encounters in order to choose from. That's why the initial 7.5, but I think that if I complete the 10 plays and still wish to play it again, it will raise even more. Great work from Alcyon!

Edit: After 14 plays, the game I have a better opinion. The game is great and for me is at least 8. Simply a great solo game!

I love the concept of the game, and the game play seems worth a shot... The art however is a dealbreaker for me. I'd have to overhaul most of the graphics, so the game would have to be very impressive to warrant that level of commitment.

Seems overly simple on the straightforward board but the real game is with the card play knowing which heroes to hold back for the upcoming round as well as surviving the current round. The dice rolls never seem too severe but those rations drop really quickly! Have only played solo so far.

beautiful artwork, great components and graphic design, good game play, but, it is a little linear... the random character draws during setup plus the order of the event cards and the player decisions are all that change from game to game... it's cool, but it would be fantastic if the game included more maps and cards for other mythological stories to play through...

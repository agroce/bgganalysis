немного асимметричные несложные дедуктивные шашки в хорошем сеттинге. 
задача следователя - каждый ход разбивать подозреваемых пополам, так чтобы у половины было алиби, а другой половины - не было, и т.о. при любых действиях фантома с половины персонажей отводить подозрения.
фантому же, наоборот, нужно чтобы все были в одинаковых условиях, и нельзя было на кого-то указать пальцем. 
у персонажей разные свойства, каждый ход есть над чем подумать. проявиться фантому чуть сложнее, за это полагается доп. бонус.

RATING: 8
Different enough from Mr. Jack that I'd say its worth trying even for players that did not care for Mr. Jack.

What I really like (and some may hate) is that even if the inspector can correctly guess who the phantom is, they need to prove it, and unlike Mr. Jack, the phantom can only win by not getting caught for long enough (vs escaping the city).

Not fans of deduction games but we got this after watching ... you guessed it... Richard Ham doing a Rahdo Run Through. We enjoyed our first play but after that we have had no desire to get it out onto the table. Guess we still just aren't deduction fans. Odd since I am a huge Sherlock Holmes fan.

Fun deduction game, it's pretty much the same as Mr. Jack Pocket only the different suspects have powers you can use to keep them moving around the game board. Nice art, nice theme, fairly simple game, I think I may like this more than its counterpart though I haven't played original Mr. Jack with expansion material yet.

Ok, but I don't think there's deduction involved here so much as a process of elimination of suspects. I wouldn't turn down an offer to play but I've got limited shelf space and it made way for a different two-player game that really shines for me, Patchwork.

Mostly the same as Mr. Jack, with the one part of that game that was to me unconvincing (movement around the board) improved. Clean and elegant. (Yes, elegant is the right word here.)

It seems weird that it's technically no longer a deduction game. Through gameplay, you're eliminating suspects until there's only one remaining, then you win -- you never have to make a mental leap and educated guess as to who the other player secretly is. I can see why some people may like that aspect less.

Still, I'd play this over Mr. Jack any time. Excellent design!

This is my (so far) only attempt at the Mr. Jack system, but it certainly is fascinating. I got it mostly because I'm a long time Phantom fan (book, film and musical) and it has enough theme to make it that much more fun. I like all you have to think about but also don't like it as you can run circles around yourself trying to logic your moves

I can't help but compare this game to Mr. Jack, seeing as it's built on the same rules base.

By changing the Jack can escape clause to the Phantom acts up and scares La Carlotta, we lose the bizarre move the investigator has to take every one in two games to avoid a loss every one in sixteen games.

By simplifying movement, it makes it so that players need to learn fewer rules in order to play, which is important, because the game is already really difficult for a newer player to beat an experienced player.

However, this game also has handicapping rules to help with that, fantastic.

No end game guessing where the investigator pulls out a victory due to sheer luck! YAH!

The theme of The Phantom of the Opera is much more inviting than that of a serial killer who murdered five women.

On the downside, the phantom player doesn't really need to bluff, as the investigator needs to flip over pawns, not figure anything out. So you aren't so much playing against the other player as both of you are playing against the board, with each turn being its own little Mark Rosewater puzzle you need to solve in order maximise the split in your favour.

The game is slightly too simplistic, it loses a certain amount of its soul by giving players fewer variables to work with. It makes it faster and easier to learn, but it also makes it feel shallower.

There is still a problem with certain people being more powerful than others, such that you can predict that, for instance, the pink person is almost always the fourth person moved.

For the Phantom player to have a chance at winning, it seems essential that the first turn involve a six-two split, otherwise too few spaces are moved along the track and there is no tension in the game whatsoever. And that six-two split seems to be dependent on the intersection between the initial pawn placement and the first four cards revealed. Sometimes a four four split is easy for the inspector to arrange, sometimes the inspector can't avoid a six two split (we even had one where the phantom could force an eight zero split).

The tension feels wrong. All the tension is at the beginning when La Carlota is moving rapidly towards the lose the game spot, but in the middle and end game, when she moves very slowly, it feels less dangerous, like there is less on the line from turn to turn. Games, in my head, should have the tension rise towards the end of the game, not fall.

In the end, it is both an improvement on Mr. Jack, and a step back. Sadly, for the Fantôme, Mr. Jack in New York appears to be solely an improvement on the game, meaning I will probably just stick with that one.

Mr jack look a like. Zelfde principe, maar nieuw bord, nieuwe personages en nieuw thema. Zou even leuk spelen als mr.Jack. 2

The phantom of the opera is een nieuw epos in de Mr. Jack-reeks en dat mag u héél erg letterlijk nemen. Zowel qua uitzicht, artwork, materiaal als spelverloop vertoont dit spel erg veel overeenkomsten met één van mijn favoriete 2-spelersspellen. Ook de auteurs zijn in deze niet veranderd, dus als u fan bent van Bruno Cathala, Ludovic Maublanc of het spelconcept dat u hier op de blog al enkele keren tegenkwam, dan is dit een erg fijne aanvulling voor uw spellencollectie. 


Om u een zicht te geven op het spelverloop raad ik u aan om de recensie van Mr. Jack hier op de blog te lezen. U vindt deze hier: http://www.bloggen.be/speleninlille/archief.php?ID=817135


Naast het thema zijn er toch nog enkele kleine verschillen. Enerzijds loopt het spel op een andere manier op z'n eind en zijn de overwinningscondities ietwat aangepast, je kan bovendien ook een soort van handicap instellen voor diegene die met het fantoom speelt. En de eigenschappen van de karakters zijn ook ietwat anders, hoewel ze erg veel gelijkenissen vertonen met de basisversie van Mr. Jack.


Doel van het spel : ofwel speelt u de inspecteur die tracht het fantoom te vinden vooraleer de diva krankzinnig wordt van dat spook dat constant op haar hielen zit ofwel neemt u de rol aan van het fantoom en tracht u diezelfde rondborstige dame dus de stuipen op het lijf te jagen. 
Moeilijkheidsgraad handicap : de speler die met het fantoom speelt kan het zichzelf moeilijker of makkelijker maken. Geen acht vaste ronden meer maar een spoor dat toont hoe gek het fantoom de diva aan het maken is. Indien je het jezelf graag moeilijker maakt begint het fantoom verder op het spoor, indien je het makkelijker wil maken, ga je al enkele stapjes dichter bij het einde van het spoor staan bij aanvang van het spel. 
De actiefase : deze blijft identiek aan het vertrouwde Mr. Jack-systeem, in de ene beurt speelt de inspecteur één actie, dan twee keer het fantoom en dan terug de inspecteur, in de volgende beurt is het net omgekeerd. Ook nu weer zijn er acht personages in het spel die alternerend aan de beurt zullen komen om ze te verzetten en hun speciale actie te laten uitvoeren.
Licht en donker : op het einde van een ronde moet het fantoom ook weer aangeven of hij zichtbaar is of niet (in dit spel noemt het "zich openbaren"). Als hij alleen staat in een kamer of in een kamer die niet verlicht is, openbaart hij zich en wordt de diva een aantal stappen voorwaarts gezet op het spoor. Als er na een beurt nog meer dan twee verdachten overblijven verschuift ze een aantal stappen op het spoor gelijk aan het aantal overblijvende verdachten. Bovendien doet ze één stapje extra als het fantoom zich heeft geopenbaard. 
Verplaatsen : geen drie stapjes hier, gewoon naar aangrenzende kamers (indien deze niet op slot is), je mag het aantal stappen zetten gelijk aan het aantal personen aanwezig in de kamer van waaruit je vertrekt.


Als de diva het einde van het spoor bereikt, is het spel afgelopen want loopt ze in een razende vaart uit de opera en wordt de voorstelling geannuleerd. Indien er slechts één verdachte overblijft tijdens het spel, dan wint de inspecteur, is het fantoom ontmaskerd en gaat de diva met een gerust gemoed haar keel open zetten.


De karakters : 
- Raoul De Chagny : verplaatsing EN trekt een kaart van de alibistapel (indien fantoomkaart, diva verplaatst één plaats afhankelijk of de rol gekozen worden door het fantoom of door de inspecteur)
- Meg Giry : kan tijdens het verplaatsen gebruik maken van geheime gangen
- Madame Giry : doet een deur op slot van haar kamer na haar beweging
- Joseph Buquet : verplaatst en legt een verduisteringsfiche in z'n kamer
- Christine Daaé : verplaatst en mag daarna alle personen in aangrenzende kamers naar haar lokken
- M. Moncharmin : verplaatst en laat alle personen in z'n kamer naar aangrenzende kamers vluchten
- M. Richard : kan gewoon verplaatsen of volledig met een andere persoon wisselen
- De perziër : mag één persoon vanuit z'n beginkamer meenemen tijdens z'n verplaatsing, hij kan deze onderweg achterlaten of meenemen tot in zijn kamer

I really really liked this game.  But then, I really really like Mr. Jack, and all of the off-shoots of that I have tried.  I like that there's a handicapping system here.  I like that multiple people can be in the same rooms.  I like the addition of the phantom cards to the alibi deck.  I like the new powers.  I'll have to play a lot more to see how it holds up.  For now, I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt based on one great play and its lineage.

A solid entry into the Mr. Jack line of games which is perhaps a little simpler to grok than the other two.   The presentation is, once again, very good.   Because there isn't a hex grid, the game sets up and plays quicker overall.   The adjustable handicap is a nice idea and we use that often.   I would say that the victory conditions here are a little anti-climactic compared to the other Mr Jack games.   There isn't hidden information here from clues, and there isn't the thrill of the hunt or the threat of sudden escape.   So the tension is lower, and I'm knocking it a point for that.   Maybe a better game to play with kids, however.

RATING: 9
This takes the Mr Jack chassis and changes movement and positioning to a point to point system. It also makes the game end at a random time. The later I like, the former I think causes the game to lose a little bit. One thing I always liked about Mr Jack was jumping through the sewers, repositioning the grates and stuff like that. Here it boils the game down to the "Seen" "Not Seen" mechanic and it works but much like Mr Jack in New York I think went too complex this I feel went a bit too simple. Don't get me wrong though I love the series and really enjoy this game.

One good aspect of this game:  both players are fully engaged in the game.  (It's not the case that, for example, that Le Fantôme stands around waiting for the Inspector to figure it out.  As the Fantôme it's also equally important to make the right moves.)
Kind of a 2-player abstract w/a theme.

We like both this version, and Mr Jack pocket.  They feel different enough to have both.

Although we overpaid for this game (to support a LGS), I will that it is well made.  The characters are on super-thick card stock, and the board is well designed.

Pros:
- each character has a special ability, some of which are pretty fun
- it plays fast, is easy to learn and works as a family game
- it feels relatively thematic
- you can add handicap to either player, which is great for newbies vs experienced players for instance

Cons:
- the core mechanic is simple dichotomic elimination rather than deduction. 
- Very little bluff or exciting decision making.
- I personally do not like the art of this game.
- you get one bad turn (either as an inspector or the fantome) and you will be struggling to recover from it

Initial Rating: 6.0 (September 2017)

Le Fantôme de l'Opéra is a game very similar to Mr. Jack. Both games use the same engine and core mechanisms. I enjoy Mr. Jack so I enjoy Le Fantôme de l'Opéra.

The rules of the game can be explained under 3 minutes if you are familiar with Mr. Jack, if not, the whole explanation can take up to 8 minutes. Gameplay is around 30 minutes.

I like the theme, but you don’t feel it through the game.

The art and components are ok.

Le Fantôme de l'Opéra is an asymmetrical two player game. The Phantom wants to chase away La Carlotta, the investigator player wants to identify the phantom´s identity before La Carlotta leaves the game. The cool thing about the game is how the players must select one or two characters (each one with a different power) in their turns trying to accomplish their goals. I really like it and it isn't obvious.

I feel it is easier than Mr. Jack because here identifying the Phantom is enough for the investigator to win, in Mr. Jack you had to catch him with another character (I think). Besides in Mr. Jack there was the possibility for Jack to escape, and that win condition was eliminated from this game.

Bottom line, I like Le Fantôme de l'Opéra but I won’t buy it as I currently own Mr. jack and both games feel and play the same way. I will definitely play it again. It is very close to being a good game for me. It is an easier game (less tension) than Mr. Jack, thus I prefer the original game.

I loved playing this game with my wife. It was simple enough to pick up and offers an adjustable difficulty that was most appreciated. More games should provide this sort of option. I loved the theme, and I felt a lot better playing as the phantom than I did as Mr. Jack. Definitely a lot less of a creep. All in all, I hope to keep coming back to this again and again.

Having not played Mr. Jack I approached this from scratch. It's intuitive though the real puzzly aspects of the game don't become apparent until after a few plays.

Le Fantôme de l'Opéra is a relatively quick two-player game where one player takes on the role of the phantom, a mysterious person terrorizing a Parisian opera house in an attempt to cause the star singer to be scared off and move away. The other player takes on the role of local detectives, trying to deduce who the Phantom is, before the diva leaves town. The game takes place over several turns where players alternate moving tokens representing important players in the opera house (director, engineer, other singers and their lovers, etc), trying to position them in such a way to slowly deduce who the phantom is, even as he is regularly striking out and trying to scare the diva.

This game is very simple, but strategically and tactically deep, with each turn usually offering multiple choices to move characters and use special abilities, but also requires plenty of planning for future turns to hopefully force the other player into less advantageous situations.

One upside to this game is that it is complex, but does not last very long. The diva only needs to be scared off a few times before she leaves town, which pressures both players to plan their moves properly. The phantom wants to stall the game, but the detectives really need to work quickly.

One downside is if you play against someone who doesn't plan very well in advance and think ahead several turns. They can be at a marked disadvantage against a player who can plan ahead.

There is nice replayability here as well. The starting board is different every time, and the order or drawn cards for movement and ability use will always change up, even between rounds.

Similar games in my collection: This kinda stands along as an abstact, tactical 2 player competitive game that has nothing to do with playing cards.

TV is not excited about this. However, he typically doesn't like Mr. Jack.

Great artwork and pieces.

Nice non-gamer introduction to the genre:

Very enjoyable 2 player deduction game. Feels fresh and interesting each turn. There's enough randomness to make it replayable, but not too much that it feels like luck is making all the decisions. Plays nice and quick too!

RATING: 10
Love this and Letters From Whitechapel.  Enjoy this due to the shorter play length and less bluffing.  Whitechapel's double bluffing is definitely fun, but each game scratches a different itch.  Love the foresight involved in Le Fantôme, like predicting what moves will be available with the next set of four characters in the next round.

RATING: 9
Very fun cat-and-mouse-type game. I also appreciate the simple rules and nice components. It feels a bit like the end-game in chess, where one person is going for the checkmate while the other is hanging on for a stalemate -- but with powers.

The strategy didn't click for my wife, though, so it isn't for everyone.

RATING: 8
This game appears to be VERY well done....  The game play, I mean.  Seems to always come down to the very last play, to see if the theater goers or the fantome wins.....

It's pretty much chess....  Thinking 3 steps ahead.... ONLY YOU CAN'T!!!!  The game let's the player choose one character to move/play and then the fantome chooses 2 and the player gets the last card, and that's round 1.  Then reverse that for round two.

I thought at first that the players would get defeated nearly every time.... but that's not how it's played out....  The game, at least in my opinion, seems to be VERY well balanced....

I really liked this one.

RATING: 7
This is an asymmetric 2-player game where one player is trying to figure out which pawn is the Phantom (through process of elimination), and the other is trying to obscure that information for a certain amount of time.  Players draft cards representing the different pawns they can move in that turn--each pawn has a unique special ability.  I suspect being the Phantom player is a little more difficult, but I haven't played both sides yet.  Still, this is a very interesting two-player deduction game.

Really great game taking the best from Mr. Jack and Mr. Jack Pocket.
This is a mix with tile system from Mr. Jack Pocket and the characters' abilities from Mr. Jack.
A clever gameplay around character placement and grouping them to have some of them be disculpated during the game.

If you don't know the series it's time to try and this is the best one to begin with !

Mr. Jack in NY was a great re-implementation of Mr. Jack as the characters could do different stuff and Mr. Jack had a better chance of winning. Here the characters can be linked to a character from Mr. Jack or his expansion, nothing new here. The 'innovating' should come from the end goal. For the inspector everything stays the same: eliminate all but 1 suspects. Now he has to do it as fast as possible, because there more suspects there remain, the faster La Carlotta will move to the exit, which is the new goal for 'Mr. Jack'. 

But all together it doens't feel that refreshing to justify a purchase. It's even less tense as often a lot of characters are useless as they are located too far away (you now move from room to room on a very ugly board) or you already know they aren't the Phantom. This seems to be one spin-off too many.

Our first game of the "Mr. Jack" series - and probably the last. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, we had some fun with it, but... I think we just prefer meatier deduction games (like "Letters from Whitechapel"). Still, if you like shorter games (15-20 minutes) and enjoy the genre, by all means, try it - it's still a very smart design and I'm sure plenty of people will love it.

More Cathala/Maublanc Mr. Jackish goodness!  Yay!!  I can't get enough!!!  So just when you thought that Mr. Jack had been explored to the limits of its potential, like a phantom in a darkened room, out pops this amazing game that incorporates so much of what makes Mr. Jack great, yet creates a very different-feeling experience (enough so that it's well-worth owning both games - or all 3 if you have Mr. Jack in New York!).  I'd say this game is slightly more approachable than Mr. Jack, even if the experience isn't quite as deep.  It's still super-fun, though.  "Sing once again with me our strange duet. My power over you grows stronger yet. And though you turn from me to glance behind, the Phantom of the Opera is there inside your mind."  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 4.5/5  Total: 9/10

Man it's tough being the Phantom! I gave it a 6 rating. I want to play it more to see if I can pull out a win. I need to learn the abilities better. My brain is always trying to remember what if I do this or do that and what cards will work out now but the next set coming will have these cards. What do I do? I am not the best detective person. I will give it a different rating I am sure the more I play it. The art work is great. I need to watch some Sherlock Holmes movies to become smarter at this game. :)

The thematic aspect really was interesting, although the game runs a lot quicker than I had expected.  Also once you figure out the strategy, there really is no point in continuing the game as you know who the phantom is or you know there is no way the other player can catch you.

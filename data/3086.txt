GAME: The Omega Virus
RANK: 2842
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.2
A sci-fi dungeon-crawl on a space station. The electronic aspect is more than a gimmick, as it would be very hard to duplicate what it does with something else. Great fun, short and exciting, and really easy to whip out and play without needing much time. The only thing that hurts the game's replayability is the virus' annoying sarcastic "help me!" voice.

SO much fun! The virus taunting you as you race to find him is hilarious, and the components are amazing for a mass-market game. One of the weapons is the same mold as the lasers from Fortress America. And when the sections of the board start closing down, the tension builds.

Not bad as a kids game but it loses it's flash quickly.  While the box is marked that it could be played as a single player game, don't buy it.  Without at least one other player there's no challenge at all.

It looks gimmicky, but hidden behind it's kid-friendly design lies a very entertaining game that makes better use of an electronic interface than even the legendary Dark Tower. I'm kicking myself for getting rid of it.

RATING: 4
This is a pretty cute adventure game.  You search rooms for keycards and weapons, which you will use to battle the virus at the game's conclusion.  The game is timed, with the virus winning if time runs out.  Cutthroat players who attack each other often can really tip the scales in the virus' favor, but blasting a buddy with lasers is simply too much fun.  Oh, and the game taunts you, so that's pretty cool (at least the first dozen times...the last 900, not so much).

Way overproduced deduction game with a speed element. It's kind of frantic keeping track of all the room discoveries, especially for someone like me who writes slowly. But it's a fun sort of frantic, and there's a guaranteed maximum time that the game will last.

[u]January 10:[/u] Used to play this game with my cousin when we were 8-10 or so. I had some really good moments with it. Basically the computer makes all the game with its constant teasing which adds a little tension to the game. The voice is absolutely horrendous but even now I still remember some of his catchphrases (hinhinhin, qu'est-ce qu'on s'amuse!!! yeah, I had it in french). Anyway, the game is probably not that great at heart but I have some very fond memories of it and I think it will appeal to young players.

Fun more for novelty and to make fun of that obnoxious voice than as an actual game. It works alright as a game, but its not special or worth effort to track down an opportunity. I'm glad there were games like this in the 90s, but I don't need it today.

This is another game you will have to search ebay for.  Totally worth it as long as the electronic part in the center still works and old batteries haven't corroded the inside.  An amazing and fun game!

RATING: 3
Not completely atrocious gimmick based kid's game. Wouldn't play now, but did quite a bit in my youth. The nicest benefit of this is the solo play, which, as an only child, I made quite a bit of use of.

Largely a luck-based game with a very nice look to it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Completely nerded out, idiotic fun.  The constant haranguing and harassment the virus levies against the player makes it worth the price of admission alone.  The game itself?  Who cares, it's fun to play and there's actually a pretty decent deduction game in there.  It's not as great as I hoped it would be, but it's a fine piece of Ameritrash and something I'd like to break out maybe once or twice a year.  Playing the 10 minute version seems impossible!

RATING: 9
This has to be one of my all time, if not the number one, favorite games I've ever played. Even all these years later, the game's charm and fun still shine through despite it being reeking of 90's mojo.

You and up to 3 other players (Yup, you can solo the game) play commandos from various nations who have been sent to a weaponized space station. It's purpose is to destroy asteroids that may be a threat to Earth. But this isn't a simple maintenance call. It's a race against time as you attempt to locate and destroy a virus that intends to turn the very station designed to keep Earth safe against it.

A semi-cooperative game that is short, sweet and to the point. The electronic terminal keeps the game flowing and taunts players along the way. Find keycards, your robotic assistant to make exploration faster, and find the special weapons you need. All while trying to locate the virus before time is out. 

A hard find (expensive too to get complete and with working terminal) but WELL worth it if you can get it. Every player, new and seasoned, I've had play this game have loved it and wanted to play more each time.

This game falls between a toy and a board game.  A relatively innovative game for it's time, IMO.  Solo play is a plus in my books, but a multiplayer game is where it shines for one reason only: Player vs. Player combat.
I can't play this for very long, since I want to choke the sh!t out of the bloody Omega Virus voice!

A rating of 5.99? - Compared to the other's I've rated 6 or higher, they take precedence over playing this title.

This game is meant for children, but is fun for adults as well.  A computer voice runs this real time game that takes 30 minutes to play.  My biggest complaint is that 30 minutes is a long time to be "on" the whole time.

RATING: 6
This game doesn't fail to deliver what it promises. Unfortunately it doesn't promise much! Still, it performs quite well as an electronic gizmo. For example, the high-pitched electronic voice wont let you press any button until it finishes its sentence. That really helps build up the necessary tension and the players move frenetically in the last few minutes.

This is essentially the boys' edition of 'Electronic Dream Phone' - both created by Michael Gray of Shogun and Fortress America fame.  You have to find out where the virus is heading on the space station (akin to finding out what boy likes you in Dream Phone).  While it seems rather easy and random, the endgame is tense as the countdown reaches the end and the overproduced goodness and space battle theme makes this an amusing centre-piece to any board game night.

This is the most annoying, yet fun game I've ever played. The game components are really nice and well produced. Game play is hectic, as the computer never shuts up and taunts you the whole time. Making it hard to concentrate on what you're doing. Like being timed isn't enough of a frustration. Though somehow this game is a blast to play. I'm not sure how well it will hold up over many plays, but I can't wait to find out. Many thanks to the thrift gods for allowing me to pick this up at a great price.

Not to deep, but the free exploration and mocking virus counting down add up to some decent game time.

Update: After playing this a lot more, it's obvious that the computer is primarily meant to pace the game, that the difficulty just isn't that variable as long as the players take their turns as quickly as they can. Of course the computer interferes with that to ratchet up the tension, but at no point is there much risk of losing if you keep moving.

Still an interesting experience (and the young ones love it) but no depth.

Very simplified dungeon crawler with a computer. It's somehow a spiritual predecessor of Mansions of Madness: Second Edition. You walk through a space station to find keys and tools to stop a virus taking over the station. The game is based around a computer which keeps track of players' movements and interactions by typing in room numbers into a keypad. I don't like it since it's purely luck driven without any decisions. However, the components are quite good.

Used to play this game all the time as a kid. The game is an electronic clue in space. You go about exploring each room to gather equipment, then track down the virus before it brings down the space station. It was alot of fun, but now I only really bring it out when I'm feeling nostalgic.

I loved this game as a kid. I remember seeing a commercial for it just before my 14th(?) birthday. I don't remember wanting to buy something just from a commercial before or since, but the game looked cool enough that I asked for it without knowing anything more.
My friends and family would play this with me from time to time, and we all seemed to enjoy it. Looking back, I don't see much more strategy than "Clue" has, but it still holds wonderful memories.

Funny to hear the taunting computer voice, but not much game in that huge box.  I gave away the complete copy that I thrifted to my old game group organizer.  
*Edit* I found a second copy, missing a part, but a fellow BGG'er helped me complete the game.

Classic childhood fun, but complex enough to give you a real challenge even today against the menacing virus. The time catches up on you and if you're not ready in the last few turns to attack, then just say goodbye.

This is definitely an Ameritrash games to introduce to kids. It's a fun deduction game that pits you against the dreaded Omega Virus who mercilessly taunts you throughout the game. The Omega Virus even makes fun of the computer station AI that you are trying to rescue in the game. This game is something akin to Dark Tower, but with a much better theme, and definitely a better game system. Search the rooms trying to find the items you need to destory the Omega Virus, and once you have you it's a final throwdown with big OV himself. It's also nice that you can paly this one solo.

RATING: 5
This game is fun and short, a bit repetative and not something I'd want to play again and again, but the mocking virus gets laughs and the time limit makes it great to bust out for a quick game on game nights just for the hell of it.

This game from the 90s was a hoot. There’s not a lot of play to it (you’re just kind of moving around and hoping to find stuff) but it’s a lot of goofy fun, as it has an electronic talking component, which serves as the countdown, the voice of the base computer begging for help, and the voice of the Omega Virus making fun of the base computer. I and one other player cornered the Virus in a room but he beat me to defeating it. I have been wanting to play Omega Virus for ages and am glad I finally got a chance.

Great filler game.  Not a easy game to lug around as the box is huge but the game plays in under 30 minutes and setup is a breeze.  Granted there is not a bunch of strategy in the game but it is fun.  The Computer and Virus could get on your nerves after repeated plays but all in all the game is fun with very nice components and a sturdy board.  Holds up rather well for being almost 20 years old.

It's totally retro and cheesy, and the voice of the virus is funny, though it does get annoying by the end due to a lack of variety (what are you gonna do? It's from 1992), but if you crank the difficulty up high, it's actually kind of fun and almost intense. Not bad.

RATING: 6.25
Nice Sci-Fi themed game.  The Electronic "BattleSat 1" talks to you as you play through the game.  YES... it does get annoying at times, but also adds to the gameplay experience.

The instructions include a little "Comic" to help introduce the game and theme.  It's really fun to "Battle" the other player's Commando or Probe.

Because the game's length is kept track of by the computer... no game is longer than 35 minutes.  The game is best when 4 people are playing, but there is also a "Single" player mode if you just want to play by yourself.  That's always a nice option when you don't have anyone else around to compete with!!

Goofy fun. It's SUCH a huge box, my buddy Dave gave the game to me after he saw how much silly fun I had. A couple years (and no plays) later, I similarly gave it away to someone else. I wouldn't mind playing it every 5 years or so, but I'm glad it's not taking up disproportionate space on my shelves any longer!

Oh man you got to be kidding me. Usually the electronic device in these types of games makes the game interesting (in a retro 'hey wow' type of way), and that usually somewhat makes up for the obligatory brainless mechanics. But the brainless mechanics in this game are a god-send compared to the annoying electro-virus voices that they put in this turkey. Avoid, or bring asprin.

I finally found this at a thrift store, in good condition and complete (with one damaged piece). I'm looking forward to playing this with my son. I was mortified to find old, corroded batteries inside, but fortunately there was no damage to the unit, and it worked perfectly.

I played solo, with my son helping me, and eked out a victory. Everyone, including my wife who was sitting nearby, was greatly amused at being called "human scum." There was quite a bit of laughter. Then my son and I played a two-player game and were entertained. I don't think this would hold up for 25+ plays. But I expect to get 10 before it gets put away for good.
We've now played a couple more times, and my opinion is unchanged. Silly, goofy, fun, but a bit predictable after a couple plays. Still fun enough, with the computer voices, to play with a young child. I figure 10-15 plays sounds about right, before it completely wears out its welcome.

Crappy luck-driven game built around a talking electronic box.  You can ruin another player's turn by talking or making noise at the right moment, and kids are the target audience.  Therefore, since kids love nothing more than to make one another's lives less pleasant, I think it's perfectly safe to assume that when this game was current, it was almost never played properly.

This is pretty fun, even when playing solo.  To make it easier for kids slightly younger, I'd say drop the battle each other player rule.  Given that, you may have to play at one level higher a bit sooner.

It would be nice if there was a slight more variation in some of the "tauntings" from the Virus.  This could deserve a reprint.

An overproduced deduction game which I found rather boring and tedious.

Pros:
* Great production value.
* Audio is entertaining.

Cons:
* I am not a fan of most deduction games.
* I am not a fan of forced time limited games with a real timer.
* Keeping track of the rooms and events is tedious and not fun.
* You can lose simply by not paying attention to the final code spoken for each room.

You must destroy the Omega Virus! I'll admit, this game seemed very intimidating at first, there is MANY pieces to this game and requires a considerable amount of set up time the first time you play it. Also, this is not a thinking man's game, you must move you piece quickly around the board, each time typing your action and room code into the command center located in the center of the board. Luckily, there are several difficulty setting, which helps with first time players. Once you fully understand the play mechanics, this game was surprisingly enjoyable and defeating the vile Omega Virus is quite satisfying.

Goofy fun...that damn virus was talking smack trying to get the other players to kill me!

I have fond memories of playing this as a child, but I'm sure my parents have nightmares about that annoying computerized voice taunting me as the time was running out.

this game doesnt hold a lot of gameplay i would look for... but the general feeling i get from playing this game takes me right back to my childhood when a game like this was so futuristic! so my high rating is probably a guilty pleasure result

I went into this, preparing to logically dissect the mission.  You can't, and the annoying voice would cause physical harm to the game if I hear it again.

RATING: 3.5
When I was a child I loved this game, but having played it fairly recently I realize how simple the game is, and how annoying that damn computer is. Ah well, it's still good for nostaligia of a time when all board games had to talk to you.

The rating's probably nostalgia kicking in, but I can still hear/quote most of the computer's lines (in a good way). As for the game... I forget. :)

What can I say? I&#039;ve always loved talking board games.  Heck I only know of 2.  This one and Dark Tower from the early 80&#039;s.  
     This game is good, but really now, the main strategy here is speed and organization.  Therefor, gameplay runs fast and smoothly (and fun with that cool &quot;big brother&#039;s watching you&quot; type of computer). Downside is that it gets old after about 3 consecutive games played in a row.

Fun sound effects, and rather fun to play once.  After one play, the narrator becomes annoying, and it becomes obvious that there isn't much strategy.

Of the various things I own, Omega Virus is one of the crown jewels!  The race against time as the virus taunts you, one by one, while the space station computer frets and pleads for assistance is such a great experience.  This enthusiasm could be childhood nostalgia talking but that alone can't account for my current fondness of the game.

Plays like a sci-fi B-movie: simple, campy fun, but only good once in a great while.  I like the way sectors get shut down, increasing the tension later in the game.  The voices can get a bit (very) grating after a few minutes.  Plays very well solo.

RATING: 6
This game would probably be a 4 if not for the cheese factor. "YOU HUMAN SCUM!!" Also nice that it has a time limit; it seems to stick around just long enough to be funny without getting overly annoying. Almost more of a conversation piece than something you'd want to play regularly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A lot of fun! Maybe not the most brilliant of ideas, and is limited in what you get to do on the space ship, but it has just enough backstabbing and the need to remember where you have been on the board to keep you interested to the end.

Command center is broken.  Will probably buy a replacement one day.

Pretty easy to learn, the command center--in hindsight--is pretty gimmicky. Haven't played it in years but I'm pretty nostalgic for it, so maybe I'll fix it up and bringing it to a game night sometime.

Everyone I've played with likes this game. It's very fast-paced and fun. I can see how it might lose some enjoyment after many rounds and I understand why people get annoyed with the computer talking all the time.. but I think it's a blast w/ the right group of people!

The voiceover coach who insisted that the computer scream "[i]help[/i] me... [i]help[/i] me" in a whiny, petulant, sarcastic voice was a frickin' genius.

The game belongs in the same category as [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5641/nightmare]Nightmare[/url] and [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3529/vampire-hunter]Vampire Hunter[/url]: a once-per-year lark that never fails to entertain.

Large format mass market game from the early 90s. The computer in the middle is a randomizer. The game works but is very simple. Definitely worth pulling out for the vintage game night.

Fun, but also very noisy, YOU HUMAN SCUM!

The figures are excellent, and despite the electronic gimmick this actually is a pretty good semi-coop game.   Solo play even works well.

Καταπληκτικο παιχνιδι για την εποχη του
αν δεν ειχε την randomia μεσα θα μου αρεσε απιστευτα.
Μπορει να του κανω και αλλο Play.Πολυ θετικο
στοιχειο οτι υπαρχει συγκεκριμενος χρονος για να ολοκληρωθει η αποστολη.
Νομιζω οτι για το 1992 ηταν αρκετα δυνατο ωστοσο η βαθμολογια επηρεαζεται 
απο τη τυχαιοτητα μεσα στο παιχνιδι που δεν του δινει replayability

The cheese factor is what makes this game fun.

Large boxed electronic game is a fun techno-treasure hunt while the computer ticks down to doom. Like most electronic games, all that clattering can get on your nerves, but it does get kind of tense as time runs out. Not as complex as it looks, you might like this one.

A really cool game from my childhood. I love the computer, although it's so annoying. The components are fantastic, and I enjoy the cleverness of the design, the way the game straddles the line between cooperative and competitive.
The rulebook also pays homage to comics, which is extra points from me.

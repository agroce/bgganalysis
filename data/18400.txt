RATING: 6
I think this game is great, but it just isn't my type of game. However, if I was going to be playing a space battle game, this is the one I would play. The game moves quickly and gets right to the point: shooting the other player's ships into oblivion! The other space battle games I have played bring too many complexities into the mix, like turn radius nonsense, different weapon types, armor levels... Frank's game eliminates most of this, but has a few neat special rules to give each player some character. I think a lot of people will enjoy this, and I hope it gets published!

RATING: 7
Gets right down to the nitty gritty. However, the ships were poorly designed.  They are difficult to manhandle and some colors are hard to tell apart.  Salvageable with some pimping, but I'm not much of a pimp.

RATING: 6
It delivers the title perfectly. This game is fast and very friendly - anyone could play it after just a few minutes of explanation. Yet it creates a wonderful smash-up in space feeling - completely with instilling the desire to make laser and explosion sounds. I'd buy it - almost. It feels just a touch over priced for what it gives back. If it becomes available for cheap, I might pick it up. It's definitely fun to play.

RATING: 7
Would rate higher, but I seem to be the only one to really like the game from my play group. Plays fast and is fairly easy to teach. The powers add a lot to the game, so it's a pity that there isn't more of them.

Might be too random for some (my play group's main gripe with the game) and as such might feel too long for those players (although my games have never gone over an hour). Be prepared to have everything you have be destroyed.

RATING: 7.4
Finding it quite hard to accurately rate this game. It's silly and quite probably unbalanced, but then, it never pretended to be otherwise. As mentioned many times by many people, the components have issues (under artificial light, the blue fighters really are hard to distinguish, and many of the ships are hard to pick up). But beyond all that, this game delivers exactly what it promises: a massive all out spaceship battle, with a lot of fun. Probably not everyone's cup of tea, but awesome in many ways all the same, and for the moment at least, I'm a fan.

RATING: 6
Pretty fun game of random shooting at stuff and wild but limited special powers, brought down by a pretty cruddy production. Blue colors very hard to tell apart, everyone gets dull gray capital ships, and the bright pink ships, together with cardboard asteroids and weird damage counters prompted me to trade it away. A decent production, and I think I might not have.

RATING: 6
A super simple game that results in a surprisingly decent play experience!

In Battle Beyond Space, you simply want to shoot the crap out of the opponents' ships, and you only have 9 turns to do so.  As a result, there's no turtling, just a game of positioning and blasting away!

The card based movement and shooting system, where you MUST do what the card you draw says, is pretty awesome.  There's no APing over what card to play for the optimal turn.  You just make the best of the card you drew, and try to set yourself up for future card draws as best as possible.

Overall, good beer and pretzel-y spaceship shooting action!

RATING: 5
I picked up BBS because I was intrigued by the idea of a 30 minute, "ameritrashy" blow-up-a-bunch-of-ships filler. And, after a first play, I was surprised at how us three players had to dig in a bit to uncover some of the various tactics.

One play isn't enough for me to fairly rate this game, as a little familiarity is needed to know how to best use those movement cards. And knowledge of everyone's big special powers helps as well. I definitely liked it enough to make sure this gets more play. 

Update: After three plays, something bugs me. I love the idea of a quick 30 minute all-out shoot-em-up space game, but the problem is that too many of the turns leave largely uninteresting choices. The first couple turns are fine for getting into position, and then there's mass destruction... and then the last three turns where you're not doing much of any interest. It's a great idea, but about 1/3 of the game's playing time leaves something to be desired.

This is a light filler space battle game. There's some luck of the draw, for sure. But it does what it sets out to do very well in my opinion.

You get a nice blend of asymmetry with the random power, enough to make each game play feel unique. And there are lots of casualties. The game plays faster as you get to the end, because most people have few (or possibly not any) ships left. 

I could see players bogging down and overthinking this one, but if played as a light 20-30 minute game it works and is a pleasure.

RATING: 8
This is potentially a great game.  Having played the prototype, I can say that it boggles my mind that no one has rushed this into production yet.  This is a fun and furious space combat game that is much better than Space Blast or any other medium-lightweight entries in this genre.  Great components, Frank!

4 player chaotic fun!  I had a good idea what this game would be like going into it and my expectations were met.  Not a lot of choices, but I think it balanced the game a bit.  You can't really gang up on one player with this kind of limited control, but you don't really need to in this game.  Lose as few ships as possible and try to score points.  Some fun.

Found alot of space battle games to be overly complex
and bound by too many rules for the sake of realism.
This game goes right for the throat and throws you into a
full scale space battle ala "Star Wars" The rules are so simple that you`ll be playing in no time. By only having
9 turns to complete your task of shooting down enemies and gaining satellites this really puts the pressure on you from the get go.Had to upgrade the components again by putting the space ships on better moving stands, but it was a small price to pay to play this fast and furious
space fight. Players might get caught up in giving orders
to their squadrons by saying things like : "Red leader
attack Dreckach capitol ship" - Roger over!

RATING: N/A
The core combat/movement mechanic is neat and fast. The game surrounding it is a bit too bare-bones for my tastes, though that does mean it plays quickly. Some sort of simultaneous-selection / simultaneous-movement variant would be awesome, though I expect it'd take a lot of reworking/house-ruling.

(Side note: the rules over who gets points in collisions are a bit odd, and if we read them right can incentivize some weird behavior. You may wish to go over them and adjust to your own taste.)

RATING: 7
Good looking game that has some heritage in Branham’s Warhamster Rally, another game in which movement is dictated by cards on a hex grid.   Play is quick and deadly, so this becomes an all-out shoot-em-up slugfest with some objectives in the center of the map.   The various special powers from game to game should help give it some replayability, but I think this is the kind of game that will end up on Tanga within a year.   Might be worth waiting to buy it then.  Unfortunately, the flat-bottomed plastic ships are a real pain, since you cannot pick them up no matter how much you keep trying.  They are too low-profile.   Some color problems too.   Still, there’s nothing else quite like it in my collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a game that I have a tough time figuring out if I like it or not. The main issue is that there's a disconnect between expectations and the reality of what the game actually is. You line up ships and expect a pew-pew space dogfight, but that isn't the case. Ships move with restrictions depending on the card you play and not always in ways you want them to. It's a game that I think ends up too gamy and doesn't deliver because even though I like it everyone else I have played with feels confused and unsure.

A game for which I have been waiting since I discovered the hobby: a simple, light, fast and furious space battle with nice tactical decisions. In the obvious absence of terrain features in space, the one-card hand is a nice way to restrict movement and to avoid over-analyzing. There is quite a bit of luck in that, and some special powers may bring some nasty surprises, but the players' choices still matter. I like that there are three unique powers for each race and just one is randomly selected for the game, so that you never know exactly what to expect.

This is the game that "Battleship Galaxies" should have been, except for the cheaper miniatures, which cause a few gameplay problems. They are difficult to pick up, two shades of blue are too close, and one design has hardly distinguishable front and back. But this is a minor complaint about what is ultimately a very fun game.

Simple, straightforward space combat.  That doesn't mean it wasn't fun though.  I really enjoyed it.  Instead of getting one ship to move and make a million actions with, here you have a fleet of 20 ships with a few quick decisions to make.  With the asteroid field terrain you felt like there was even a little bit of dogfighting and out-manuevering with your opponents as well since combat (with the fighters) is only done in straight lines ahead of your ship.  I'm hoping this eventually gets published, because I very much want to own it.

RATING: 3
Even though I like some chaos, this was too random. There is no advance planning and you wind up killing some of your own ships. That doesn't make sense to me in a 3D simulation. Then, the designers apparently wanted fancy bits, but didn't supervise well because some of the ships are hard to distinguish and all of them are difficult to pick up.

The long incubation for this game has delivered positive fruit. Your fleet is divided into three squadrons of 6 ships each and each turn you get to flip a card which says how far a squadron can move, how far it can fire and then how many 60 degree rotations it can make to face a different direction. The inspired twist is that ships within a squadron can all face different directions, so the individual ships can all head off in different ways, producing a fabulous sense of controlled chaos and the real sense of a movie battle. Killing ships equates to victory points, and you lose nothing when you lose your own (except the chance to kill more stuff) so there's absolutely no turtling in this game, and the killing mechanic is simple - if you're in line and in range, you die. As more and more ships die, the game speeds up nicely, and after 9 rounds, count up your kills, most kills wins. There's not much groan/gloat factor as there's no random resolution, and that reduces replay a bit. But it's definitely interesting how it all plays out and provides a genuine sense of epic-ness with such a simple rule-set in such a short time span, which is fun in its own way.

A really good game for the price. You should know what you're getting though before you buy. It's not a deep game, but there is a lot of strategy involved, I think. It moves quickly, but I feel like going after the other players is such a huge advantage. My only other complaint would be with some of the components, the box doesn't seem to be high quality, and taking the cheap way out on the ships was really disappointing.

Dieses Raumschlachtspiel für drei oder vier Spieler hat etwas von „Nexus Ops“: wenige, von vornherein durchsichtige Regeln, bunte Plastikminiaturen und ein sehr klares Spielziel: den Gegnern vor die Maske zu hauen und (fast) nur dadurch Siegpunkte zu ergattern. Sicher kein ‚episches‘ Spiel (sogar „Nexus Ops“ dürfte zu viert im Regelfall etwas länger dauern), ist es doch auch mehr als ein bloßer ‚Filler‘: Allein wegen der unterschiedlichen Spezialfähigkeiten (über deren Balance man unterschiedlicher Auffassung sein darf) bietet sich ein Spieleabend mit zwei bis drei Matches an. Anders als bei „Nexus Ops“ spielt hier das Glück eine nur sehr bescheidene Rolle. Insgesamt höchst erfrischend und durchaus auch für Spieler geeignet, die konfrontative Spiele nicht so sehr mögen.

The board is well set up to make for interesting early game that isn't the same every time.  The special powers aren't perfectly balanced, but they are reasonably close.

Fun shoot em up space game - feels a bit like Wings of War but with a lot more ships.  Only takes 9 turns, so in theory should be pretty quick, but in a 4p game, it did feel like there was a bit too much wait between turns (unlike Wings of War, which plays super fast). During the first few turns, I was thinking I didn't like it - too chess like - but as more ships get destroyed, and each player had fewer options, it ironically became more fun. I think I still like Wings of War/X Wing over this.

Theres a lot of chaos but theres certainly strategy in the midst, using cover, hoping your fleets make their destinations, suicide attack runs, this game covers it.  Being someone who loves but can't stand playing Twilight Imperium, this may just be the game for me, especially if it gets some massive expansion love.  They should absolutely put out some new obstacles, objectives and race in an expansion, it's so light that expansions would only add indefinitely to what is sure to be a fantastic franchise.

I was prepared to hate this game but actually I quite enjoy it.  It is simple and the card drawing gives it some randomness that doesn't allow you to overly plan.
Folks at work seem to like it more than I thought possible.

Surprisingly entertaining game! The forced movement and three different squadrons are what make it work. The theme is solid, it plays quick, and it doesn't try to add any unnecessary chrome. All in all, I really enjoyed this for what it is.

Minor quibble, the blue ships are really difficult to tell apart.

What can I say? After all the time they spent to get this game out,2 of the blue ship squadrons are virtually the same color. One guys' squadrons look like pontoon bridges, you can't hardly pick up the ships to move them, & the play is way too random. I usually like a degree of randomness, but this felt like I had no control over a bunch of Kamikazee guys every turn.

This game is what it is. It's a quick space shoot 'em up game. Doesn't take itself too serious and is a lot of fun with the right group.

Despite the appealing hyperbole in the description, the details make this sound like a thinly themed abstract that could just as well be about something other than fighting spaceships. Will be watching to see if there is more sci-fi appeal to it...

This is a great and fun game. In an hour, you will have a very exciting space battle epic with simple rules, enough strategy, and a ton of fun! It is one of its kind. Other games take hours to provide a nice and rich space battle plus pages and pages of rules. Go and get your copy!

I don't mind randomness and chaos in games, but this one goes too far with it. 

Feels like you're trapped in an alien spacecraft, in an asteroid field, with no ability to control the vessel. I think I would rather remove my scrotum with a rusty cheese grater than play this again.

I got this as a door prize. Traded it away without opening it after seeing a number of poor reviews.

It does what it does very well. What it does is not something that greatly appeals to me, so I won't play it too often. But that's not a knock on the game.

Wow I disliked this game. Felt completely out of my power and decisions made very early on effected long term game play. I can imagine someone enjoying this or doing well at it but wow I didn't like it.

Opportunity cost problem here. Just...not good enough to bother.

Action filled slug-fest in space.  Relatively easy rules to get right into the action.  Don't look for deep strategy or gamer's game material here.  Just deploy the fleet, start firing, and have fun.

I was recently accused of only liking games that are fun.  That accusation was rather telling, I thought - but more about the accuser than about me. I'll gladly admit that I like fun games, but I also like games that are intellectually stimulating and highly interactive, without being fun in the traditional "giggles and laughter" sense of the word.

To sum up: All games that are fun are good, but not all good games are fun.

As to why these comments are relevant here, please don't enter a game of [i]Battle Beyond Space[/i] with any other expectation than to be entertained for 60 minutes.  Sure, any game can be enjoyable with the right people. But when the game itself makes you laugh, that's a good sign.  But also be aware that your ships will crash, your feelings will get hurt, and someone else will win the game because their special power is insane or because they draw the right movement card at the right time.

Suck it up, Francis.  We're [i]beyond[/i] space, where the normal rules of physics, statistics, and emotional health do not apply.  What else did you expect?

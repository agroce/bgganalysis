Great update to an AH classic.
Not cheap (UK), but there is a *lot* of game in that box. Incredible amount of detail that can be added a component at a time. Rules include a scenario designer to further increase replayability. Fantastic game for 'track-heads'!

Panzer's shortcomings are even more evident here. MBTs slug it out at what is actually a pistol shot distance for them so initiative (bascially who shoot first) becomes even more crucial.

Getting into the system slowly. The rulebooks could use an edit that has not played one of the previous titles before. It very much shows that this sone mans life long passion project. The system is great, but the information is just bolted on in a grotesque abomination.

Rating of 7 after first play of basic scenario. After some initial wrinkles the game flows fairly smoothly. Once both sides are in range and spotted then combat is fairly lethal.

Will try and retrofit the sequence of play to the older IDF game as this is the theatre that interests me more than hypothetical NATO/WP conflict.

In depth look at 1980's tactical warfare. As an avid micro tank gamer of the 1970's and 80's this is just up my street. Great, if a little complicated, simulation. Track heads will enjoy it, others beware it can be a bit overwhelming but if you are interested in th subject it should make sense. Trade? No way this ones a keeper!

Edit
It's a tough learn but worth it.

A much-refined--to the point of nearly being a complete redesign--of the original Avalon Hill title.  The maps are completely different and the system has evolved a good bit and has obvious similarities to the 2nd Edition of PANZER (and the maps are compatible with that series!).  Players of the GMT PANZER will have little trouble getting into this title.  If you like meaty tactical modern armor games, this one is likely for you; some prefer platoon scale over individual vehicles and squads that we find here, so be advised.  The game is often lethal, lethal, lethal given the weaponry, but the soft factors (morale, unit, formation (company) and force effectiveness, command and control, are all included.  Basic rules and even the Advanced Rules for all-armor contests move at a brisk pace; infantry, artillery, ATGMs, and aviation with all the relevant bells and whistles will admittedly slow things down a lot, but the detail/chrome may be worth it for a good number of folks.  The Advanced and Optional rules are modularized enough that you can add only what you want and not the rest.  Can't stop playing this at the moment; it's just that engaging to me!

While there are better sistem for tactical combat during WWII and Panzer (the former game in the serie) is far from being my favourite, simulating an ipotetical WWIII MBT do a very good job. What we miss from GMT now is a new edition of Next War.
Two interesting expansion are on the way, hope they include Warsaw Pact forces allied of Moscow.

Maps are not as bad as some have been saying - simple but easier for Line of Sight issues

Straight into advanced rules -plays well with a lot of flavour - looking forward to adding helo's and other units

Remake of the old AH's MBT with GMT's Panzer 2nd. Ed. game engine. The result is awesome and better than the old game.

a great sequel for the "Panzer system". Played first scenario with basic rules, command rule (advanced game) and morale rule (optional). Enjoyed a lot! In the week-end replay of scenario with advanced rules for AP combat...

MBT is a variant of the Panzer vehicle/squad rules applicable to "modern" warfare.  While the game is set in the mid-80s the vehicle selection is sufficient to make the game applicable from the late 70s to 2000.

The rules are long, mainly because they go over in detail all the material in the 30 tables on the player aid card.  After you've read the rules once, the tables serve as an adequate reminder for most game details.  The extensive table of contents and index help you find the rest if you happen to forget.  Unusual for GMT, the rules could have benefited from one final proof reading for garbled sentences and mis-formatting.  Depending on how you look at things, MBT either requires a graduate education in modern weapon systems or gives you one in the 54 pages of advanced rules.  The core of the game is actually fairly simple, but it is buried inside all those pages of reiterated table information, so the system is harder to learn than it should be.  Maybe someone will extract that core and post it to BGG.

Game play is surprisingly fast considering all the tables (e.g. over a dozen are required to shoot at a tank, but "only" half that many to shoot at an infantry squad).  Still, you can fight a 15-turn company-sized battle in an evening.

The included scenarios are fairly generic, but detailed instructions are provided for making your own using the order of battles and numerous vehicle cards provided.  There are even pointers for making sure your scenarios are balanced.  The largest scenario I've played so far came out tied to within 8 points out of 2800.  I don't think anyone is going to complain about play balance here.  Likewise, there is plenty of tactical depth as all those weapon systems and defensive measures interact.

As usual with GMT the materials are great.  The box, however, is not quite big enough to hold all the game parts if you try to impose any organization at all on the punched pieces.  Sorting out all the makers (well over a dozen types) takes a lot longer if you don't.  It looks like this problem applies to the whole Panzer family from GMT.  One of their rare development goofs.

Just received. Have skimmed the advanced rules (I am familiar with Panzer), and it looks like a fairly easy transition for players who have played the Panzer advanced game.Really looks great. My minor aesthetic criticism for both this and the Panzer games is I wish they had used the 1" hexes, but perhaps made the vehicles (which I believe are 7/8") 3/4". I love the big chunky counters, but slightly smaller vehicle counters would made the map less cramped when counters are clumped up. Second, while I actually like the maps, I wish they could have been made with one fold instead of several, but I do understand why it had to be done the way it was. Also, in this series, the maps seem very 'open', which is great for figuring LOS, but I ideally like the look and feel of the terrain in the old West End Games Tank Leader games, for example.

In any case, really looking forward to playing this.

The cover art is best in show...an homage to the original, yet feels modern.

RATING: 5
What kept me from giving MBT a higher rating is game art:

Map art and terrain rendition is quite poor:  a 10 years old kid with a map generator software could have done better.  The result is quite uninspiring and totally non-evocative of the German country landscape it should stand for. 

The main art effort has gone into vehicle cards (these are really good) and counters.  Unfortunately, vehicle counters are way too large, as they totally cover the hex they are in:  so, when you play, you get those huge tanks roaming in a much smaller scale landscape.   Map art is bad, and the contrast with the huge pics of tanks makes things worse. This could have been good for a game about giant Megamechs , not for a simulation of a realistic tank combat.  

As all infos are on vehicle cards, there was really no need of space for data beside the vehicle art,  just type and identifying number or letter; so, surely the decision to do vehicle counters so big has been taken to show off the fine counter art. They have kept the same standard and choices from the parent PANZER series, but I don't like it and find this combination a real turn-off.

The standard game isn’t nothing to write home about and  to get the best from MBT you need the whole hefty second set of rules (advanced & optional):  for those used to simpler games (like LNL's World At War series) this game may look too difficult but if you want detail, chrome and a much more accurate simulation of modern tank combat, MBT is a good tactical game, with great potential for expansion and re-playability (besides the terrible choices made on game art…)

Play-tested MBT (II).  Excellent squad-/individual-vehicle level game.  As written, you can layer on as much or as little rules density as you like. It lacks some of the chaos / chrome of ASL, but is otherwise one of the top tactical games available, IMO.

Deeply complex game, kind of scared for the time investment to learn the advanced game versus the fun factor pay off in playing it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Game is wonderfully detailed, but it lacks something in the mechanics that makes it feel quite right. The relationship between fire and movement is a bit off I think, and the initiative in the game is so important, and something you can't control, that tank engagements really just come down to who has the better tanks and the iniative most of the time. Sure, proper play and tactics matter, but proper play and tactics can totally not matter if the luck meter is slightly in the negative.

Really a great tactical modern combat games !
The Nato Varsaw Pact clash like you're in...
You're not in WWII with new toys, you're really in mobile tactical warfare, don't move, you're bypassed and fired in the rear. The Soviets toys are really impresive.

Now playtesting BAOR & FRG expansion, some more rules (leader and special terrain).
This gives you british (great Challenger tanks, but FV432 not the best) and german units (the Leo in familly, 4 of them, lots of milan ATGW)  and add some news maps, like an airport, a Fuel or chemistry stockage center, autobahn ....
10 more scn by expansion, and really different flavor when you play.

Clearly and really a most have, allways a game on the table (now i've a special wargame room, MBT have it's special table !! )

MBT is an outstanding wargame if you are looking to capture tank warfare in a relatively modern setting.  The game is very approachable with the basic rules, and you can add in advanced rules to quickly make the game as complex and realistic as you could possibly imagine.  Probably for more dedicated/'hardcore' wargamers.

RATING: 5
Game is beautiful and nicely presented. Very complex for what you get out of it, though, but it does admittedly seem to do a good job replicating actual tank data. What I dislike the most is the lack of any rate of fire for tanks. Basically a tank gets one shot at one target per turn, and so an enemy tank can waltz right up to you if you miss (or fired at another tank). Totally unrealistic.

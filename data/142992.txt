3 plays / 3,4 players

LIKE: Quick game. I like the table talk as long as no one is taking it seriously. The card play mechanism is clever and the card draft is smart since players can see what others partially have.

DISLIKE: Chaotic. Mostly luck-based decisions since ship positions vary wildly. Repeated plays might get boring, but occasional games are fun.

OVERALL: Best with 4 players, a fun filler or family game for occasional play. Sometimes the cards go your way, sometimes not.

This is a very interesting and unique game. You really have to think strategically from a number of different ways - how far forward are you alphabetically, how close are people on both sides of you, and is it likely that you'll go forwards or backwards while playing a particular card? There's a definite deduction point in play, and it can be very difficult, but always worth the fun.

RATING: 8.84
An amazingly fun abstract racing game! Probably the deepest gateway I have ever played. Definitely NOT a runaway leader problem in Gravwell, as the core rule (you are pulled by the gravity of the nearest ship) guarantees that being in first is a very transient thing!

Flaws? Card-counters will definitely have an advantage in Gravwell; and the components should have been of much higher quality.

Only played it once, but definitely wouldn't mind playing it more.  It's a silly little game that's slightly heavier than filler, with a nice bit of bluffing tied into your action-programming and drafting.  On a random note, the designer is also a pretty chill guy - he was bringing the game around at one of my FLGS recently.

This is a decent game. I like the simultaneous card selection since it creates a guessing game with your opponents. However, the game falls a little flat for me because it seems overly simple and a little dull. I would definitely play it again if asked, but I didn't like it enough to keep it in my collection.

The game is essentially one big giant catch-up-mechanic where your last cards disproportionately matter more than anything else you do throughout the game. Furthermore,the game provides little useful information to make decisions from. Your biggest asset in winning this game will come from remembering what cards were drafted in the beginning; But because half the cards are hidden information, and the game may end anytime, the vast majority of your decisions will be made on nothing more then your gut feeling.

If you boiled down games like RoboRally to their very core I think Gravwell is the game that would come out. This game has players repeatedly trying to read the opponents' minds and plan their moves based around what others are doing. I love this, especially in a 2-player game, because it creates this great "Battle of Wits" feeling that always brings me to the point of chuckling at how many steps in advance I'm planning. Perhaps one of the best ideas this game brings is the natural catch-up mechanism. It's the very nature of this game that players who have jumped out to a large lead are doomed to be pulled back, while players who have fallen behind can reach them quickly. I imagine with more players the game might get pretty chaotic, much like any programmed movement game, but I think it would still be enjoyable. I don't feel the need to own this game, though, because each turn is almost exactly the same. While I like the puzzle of "what will my opponents do next?" it could get old quickly since it is virtually the same thought process every single turn. It's a game I would gladly play if offered, but I'm not going to suggest it any time soon.

Race game with a gravity twist! Players are trying to escape from a black hole but are constantly pulled towards singularity. In addition they are also pulled to the closest object - that in most cases is other players ship. Players play cards at the same time depicting if they want to be pulled or pushed and with what value. First impression is that this game is really random but it's not the case. It's about risk management and even with bad cards but played right you can loose less then your opponents making you the winner ;). It's fun and plays fast.

RATING: 6
 It was a light, chaotic game where reading other players is important. It plays quick and is fun where the strategy is in the draft and outguessing what everyone else will do each round. I'd rate it as 7 for games I like. Then I added a 0.5 point because I think it does what it does very well and then I added another 0.5 point because it's the first game of a local designer. Not one I need to own, but I'll happily play it anytime.

The thing I love most about Gravwell is that every round is a 'Princess Bride' moment wondering what the other players are going to play.

It's a little opaque to new players and generally just feels like it goes a little long for what it offers. I'm sure that would change if I played it a few more times with people who have all played before, but that doesn't seem to be the target audience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
   With only a handful of rules, Gravwell is a relatively simple game wherein players try to exploit / mitigate the effects that all other player's movement have on their own.

   It's not a game worth playing with only 2 people, but 3 - 4 make it worthwhile.

   In terms of quality, 4 / 6 of the pedestals for my spaceships were shipped broken.  I was able to kragl two of them, but I left the derelict spaceships as is.

RATING: 4
I think a 4 is somewhat generous because this is a fairly long game that I believe in the end is almost entirely random. I really like the concept though. It feels like you are making good calculated decisions in the play of cards, but the way the game works successful decisions really don't accrue over the course of the game, as the game actively works to keep the ships together. The edge a good player has over a poor one is small, which is normally OK, but there is only one scoring of the game, after 7 rounds. You essentially play six rounds of this game that DO NOT MATTER. You would need to play this dozens of times to see the edge seep in to a meaningful degree. Nice concept poorly executed. Must be kickstarter.

*5* (Initial Plays)
Game felt very chaotic on my first play, and I won the game without really knowing how I did it. There's some interesting decision making with what others are planning, and in what sequence things will happen, but having an actual strategy to win the game seems laughable. Probably a good game for some fun if players don't mind being frustrated from the random acts of movement throughout the game.

The board is dull but the game play is cool.  You can make plans by choosing a good card for you but when it comes to your turn the board may have changed.

A highly dynamic racing game which solves the runaway leader problem.  Excellent gateway game.  The design is fun and chaotic.  This is not one of those games you play to win.  You play this game for the experience and it guarantees to offer something new.  Don't bother playing this one as a 2 player game.  It SHINES with 4 players.  I would recommend this game as a beer and pretzels game or as a more random gateway game anybody can win (hey gives those non gamers a chance to win would you!). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I'm surprised that I don't find this game more appealing - it's an elegant, lovely design. The half-public draft allows for some deduction of others' plans, but misreading others' intentions (or having incorrect timing) can throw off your own intent, and if others' plans rely on you then you get glorious RoboRally-level snafu-chaining. 

It may be because I found mentally tracking who had what a bit tricky - and without that partial-knowledge it's more random-speculative than purposeful-hopeful.

Had I only played this once, the rating might be a touch higher.  I had a ludicrous amount of fun in that first game.  I suspect the fact that we had four players and the chaos was ramped a little helped, as did our sense of discovery at figuring out what was possible.  The second play, one with only three players, was a bit more muted.  For now I'm content to split the ratings, because I think the game really wants all four players.  But it is possible the game is just never going to be as good as the first time.

Light-weight and very unpredictable racing game.  The problem here is that game reveals everything it has to offer you in the first 3 minutes of play.   That's all there is.   So, the game will have a very short shelf life.   The drafting of cards is completely useless since half of the cards are unknown anyway.    With an odd number of players, it is likely that the middle player could get sandwiched often and do nothing on there turn.  Fun?  When closest ships are tied, you'd think center of mass would dictate direction, but that's not the case.   Simplicity of rules wins out over common sense.  Definitely a "one and done" game for me.

The gameplay can be really swingy depending on what other people play, which can be quite frustrating. After 1 play I'm ok with playing it again, but I wasn't in love with it

In Gravwell: Escape from the 9th Dimension, players command spaceships that have been pulled through a black hole, transporting them into a different dimension. With each ship lacking fuel to get home, each player must collect basic elements from surrounding asteroids, using the gravity of the dimension and what little resources they have in order to reach the warp gate that will take them home. But in this dimension, moving ships will travel towards the nearest object, which is usually another ship, and when those objects are moving either forward or backward, reaching the warp gate isn't always easy. Time is running out to save your crew and your ship! As a grim reminder of the cost of failing to escape, the frozen hulks of dead spacecraft litter the escape route – but with careful cardplay, you can slingshot past these derelict craft and be the first to escape from the Gravwell!

This easy-to-learn game uses 26 alphabetized cards to determine movement order and thrust; most cards move your ship towards the nearest object, but a few move you away from it. Players will draft fuel cards in each round – picking up three pairs of two cards, with only the top card of each pile being visible – giving you some information as to which moves you can expect from the other spaceships. During a round, each player will play all of his fuel cards in the order of his choosing. During each phase of a round, each player will choose one card, then all cards are revealed and resolved in alphabetical order. When your opponents move in ways you didn't expect, you won't always be heading in the direction you thought you would! Each player holds an "Emergency Stop" card that he may tactically play only once per round to avoid such a situation.

Whoever first reaches the warp gate wins, but if no one has escaped after six rounds, then the player who is closest to the gate wins.

Ok game, seems quite chaotic to me, not much real strategy since only 1/2 of the cards are known.

Really unfortunate phallic design of the ships.  Whoops.

RATING: 5
A comparison to Category 5 is pretty much the first thing that comes to mind when playing Gravwell. Simple idea, quick-playing, simultaneous action selection.

There is a clear winner to that comparison and it is not Gravwell. One reason is that in Gravwell it is extremely important (much more so than in Category 5) to figure out what the other players are going to do, and the only way to make halfway competent guesses about that is counting cards and referring to the card distribution chart on the board. That turns a silly light race game into a memory contest, which is one of my least favourite mechanisms to begin with. The card distribution also makes it much harder for a leader to defend their lead than for a straggler to catch up. I'm not entirely sure whether that's a bad thing by itself but it does serve to extend a quick romp into something that is longer than it should be. And finally, even with your best card-counting effort predicting the state of the board when you're sure to go late in turn order is an impossible feat, and since miniscule differences in board state can lead to vastly different results of your chosen action the game is much more chaotic than Category 5. But it does have a theme.

Gravwell is Cribbage as it might be played by Harry Seldon. It's a card-drafting game mixed with a little Raj or Pico 2, all tied together with an elegant gravity-based movement rule. I love it to pieces.

RATING: 7
Quite abstract in nature, but Gravwell manages to create a theme that works for its very basic design.  Essentially a race game with cards, but the unique movement rule creates a fun, tense little game here. There is one degree too much of randomness here to consider it a strong, calculating game, but it is all balanced rather well by the need to try and read your opponent and play your cards best based on what you know they have in their hand and what order you think is best to play your cards. It plays quick so there's really no major worry about how lady luck played a little too much into it.  A fast, very interesting, simple card game with a great theme and a unique approach. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Although it isn't too in depth in theme, what theme it has is so heavily attached to the mechanics that it well makes up for it.  It plays quick, and you can explain it real easily.  Although the novelty might wear off, it's still fun and quick.  A little note though, as much as I love the box, it's three times thicker than it needs to be, so when you travel with it, consider just sticking the components in the box of another board game.

Quick filler card drafting game that has amusing mechanics as the board has 2 neutral ships placed out a ways from the start point and most of the cards have number on them and pull you towards the closest ship which will make you go backwards as play order is hard to predict so the nearest ship can end up being behind you. The object is to just escape the Gravwell.

Three solo plays in and I have won once. A lot of luck involved but a healthy dose of strategy too. I like it so far! 

Played with four. Fantastic, quick game. This could be the perfect gateway game.

After another four plays - in one hour no less! - I am solidly enjoying it.  Its ease of play and lightness only make it better.  There is certainly some luck, but the game is in knowing and guessing your opponent's moves.

As someone at the table said, "6 Nimmt, the board game" - the chaos gives the illusion of control. If someone has a higher than 33% win rate in 4p games, I'd be surprised.  The last two card plays/turns of the game seem to decide the winner.

I don't know if there's a name for the "everybody picks their action speed at the same time and that determines turn order" subgenre of doublethink games, but it turns out I like it a lot. Enough that I kinda like this game which is 90% that and 10% programmed movement disasters.

Needs more of an arc, though; even with the derelict ships, it's more like playing the same microgame 7 times in a row than playing one coherent game.

Played at STG Con.  Decent enough little simultaneous action movement game that happens in ONE dimension (talk about a misleading title).  The real game is in guessing whether someone else will move past you or near you in a way that makes you go the opposite direction of what you want.

Like a much simplified robo rally.  Except it's not.  I think the robo rally rules take up less words than the Gravwell rules do.  It's not presented very well.  The circular visual on the board, while thematic, makes the game appear much more complex than it really is.

I would just always rather play Robo Rally.  But then, that's true of most games.

Gravwell is a racing game with one of the more fun ways of getting around the board that I have experienced.

2-Player: I have now played with 2 players and the game was better than I thought it might be based on the solo play. I still suspect that it is better with 3 or 4 players and probably best a 3, but I still need to play at these player counts to be sure. Rating the game now for the 2 player experience as a 6.

Solo Play: I had (and still have) relatively high expectations for this game, but the solo game is bordering on horrible. I play a fair amount of solo games and expect them to be hard - not much point in playing something you win every time, but pure randomness is frustrating. 
Hopefully, it is better with multiple players, but I am expecting to only want to play this with 3 or 4 and expect that to be fun and perfect for the right time and group.

Very fun game where you use the gravity of other ships to slingshot yourself out of the black hole. When I first heard about the game, I thought it was interesting, but was unsure I would like it. The more I thought about it, the more I enjoyed the idea, and finally got it. I do not regret it at all! What a fun and simple game!

It's very easy to teach. It's a bit unique for game mechanics, so while easy, it may take some people a few examples to understand fully. However the uniqueness is what makes this game great.

What I love, especially, is that when you get closer to the end, it gets so much harder to get that extra distance you need.

This is a rather chaotic game.  It seemed like the first 75% of the game is superfluous and you can reduce the game to a five minute game.

In one game I got a huge headstart and was around halfway while the other players were still at the singularity.  However, you cannot really advance by yourself and 3/4 way through the game I was only a couple of spaces ahead of where I was and my opponents were past me.  Yes, this means that there is no runaway leader, but it also means that doing well early in the game is meaningless.

Opening the box, the game is happily easy to unpack.  There are not very many pieces, and it doesn’t take an hour to get set up.  In fact, the first time out of the box, it might take you ten minutes to set up the game board, read the rules, and start playing.

Complexity: Low

While there aren’t very many pieces (there’s a board, 7 pieces, and a small deck of cards), they are reasonable quality.  Not amazing, but I’ve definitely seen worse.  For example, your pieces are actually spaceships (instead of cubes or pawns), which is nice, since you actually control a spaceship.  They’re sculpted plastic and fully assembled right out of the box.

Quality: Moderate

Then we actually get to gameplay.  This game straddles an interesting line between cooperation and competition.  It’s clear that the game is competitive, BUT you can’t win without the other players (inadvertently) helping you.

How does this work, you might ask?  On each of your turns, you will be playing a card, face down.  The card will move you a number of spaces in the direction of the nearest gravitational object (i.e. other player).  So if you’re in first place, you will actually move backwards!  Each card also has a letter that shows when you will move, so if you are in first, you might want to try to move your ship after someone has passed you.  Delaying, therefore, is an important strategy of the game.

Also, since everyone plays their cards at the same time, face down, you might have a great strategy, only to have another player totally mess up your plans by activating before you and moving to a spot that causes that ship’s gravity to affect your ship.

Challenge: High

Finally, the important question.  Do you want to play it again?  For starters, the game is abstract (like chess or checkers), so it’s different every time you play.  It all depends on what cards you have, what cards your opponents have, and what cards get played when.  Some games are scenario-based, and after you beat a scenario, you don’t feel like playing that one again.  When you run out of scenarios, the game itself loses its appeal.  This game does not have that problem.

Replayability: High

Overall, I would give this game an 8 out of 10.  It’s not my favourite game ever, but based on the people I am gaming with, I would recommend that we play it, and if someone suggests it, I would happily agree.

I enjoy this game. My opponents, not so much. It takes a while to get a handle on the gravity mechanics. The game is thematically a 10 for me. You're in space, your direction relies on the nearest gravitational object (the ships of your opponents and a few derelict ships floating around). There's a little bit of strategy, a little bit of card drafting, you draft in rounds, so if you had a poor round, you can try to make up for it the next round.

Why it's a 6? Because I've found the concept to be difficult for some people, a lot of times, you don't win because you strategized better, you win because you opponents consistently played cards they didn't understand what would happen.

Have only played with 2 but think it would be even more chaotic - and better! - with more. Has a feel of Slide 5 in that it is quite chaotic and your best laid plans may go awry, but there is a bluffing/reading aspect which I enjoy.
UPDATE: Third play with 4 fell flat. Sometimes there just may be less interaction based on card draw and play.

What a fantastic racing game to escape the gravity singulation.  Cards will either push you away from the nearest ship, pull you towards the nearest ship or draw all ships closer to you.  The order of play is alphabetical, so an early card in the alphabet will have you moving before others.  Lot's excitement for this game will minimal components.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
This easy-to-learn game uses 26 alphabetized cards to determine movement order and thrust; most cards move your ship towards the nearest object, but a few move you away from it. Players will draft fuel cards in each round – picking up three pairs of two cards, with only the top card of each pile being visible – giving you some information as to which moves you can expect from the other spaceships. During a round, each player will play all of his fuel cards in the order of his choosing. During each phase of a round, each player will choose one card, then all cards are revealed and resolved in alphabetical order. When your opponents move in ways you didn't expect, you won't always be heading in the direction you thought you would! Each player holds an "Emergency Stop" card that he may tactically play only once per round to avoid such a situation.

Whoever first reaches the warp gate wins, but if no one has escaped after six rounds, then the player who is closest to the gate wins.

Replacement (slight graphic upgrade - thats it)

In Gravwell: Escape from the 9th Dimension, players command spaceships that have been pulled through a black hole, transporting them into a different dimension. With each ship lacking fuel to get home, each player must collect basic elements from surrounding asteroids, using the gravity of the dimension and what little resources they have in order to reach the warp gate that will take them home. But in this dimension, moving ships will travel towards the nearest object, which is usually another ship, and when those objects are moving either forward or backward, reaching the warp gate isn't always easy. Time is running out to save your crew and your ship! As a grim reminder of the cost of failing to escape, the frozen hulks of dead spacecraft litter the escape route – but with careful cardplay, you can slingshot past these derelict craft and be the first to escape from the Gravwell!

A "looks-fairly-simple-on-the-surface" game that causes all kinds of grief when playing. You'll have to balance what the cards do (that alone can be tricky) with the order they'll go off in and what you think others are going to do. Add in a touch of randomness and it's the kind of controlled chaos that I like in a game. Plus, it plays pretty quickly.

This is a unique racing game where you're trying to reach the end, but you move towards your center of gravity, which means that everyone is basically leapfrogging off/around each other. I played for the first time at Rathcon 2014 with Slate and DeMo, and I really enjoyed it even though Slathe kicked our asses. This is one of those games that I'll always be happy to play at a game day.

Not nearly as random as it seems.  Remember, unknown but fixed information is not randomness.  What little randomness there is in the game is mitigated by a clever draft system each round.  The actual movement system is simple mechanically and thematically appropriate.  A great race game that messes with gravity and makes winning completely unappealing until you actually win, much like Power Grid.  Also much like Power Grid, it's easy to catch up if you fall too far behind.

Racing game with a unique twist.  You draft fuel cards each round where some a face up and others are down.  You then play those cards simultaneously with other players.  Most cards pull you to the nearest object and others push you. But you never know how the order will be resolved.  

It is a fun game, and pretty light.  Play runs a little longer than I would like, but overall an acceptable game which runs a bit long for a filler.

This is a fun game where everyone is trying to escape a black hole and get back to normal space. You do that by either gliding to the closest density of mass, or repulsing your ship away from it, or by using your tractor beams to bring everything a little closer to you.
The game is fun. After you get started and pick up the idea of what your doing, the game will move quickly.
Easy for many different ages. I definitely recommend this game!

What a delightful game!  There are so few components but it is so much fun.  Less is more applies well for this game.  Though because of this there ends up being a lot of dead space in the box.  But whatever.

This is a great mind game that is easy-to-learn and it is so satisfying when you screw over your opponent.  Had many a great laugh when my friends were so close to the warpgate only to have them move backwards once the cards were played.

A simple game to play, and almost feels random. You each pick cards with letters and effects, but they resolve in alpha order, not turn order. so you plan can be thrown by a bad order. The strategy comes in with planning for each variable that could happen.

Gravwell is swingy.  Basically like one big catchup mechanic.  The further you are behind, the easier it is to make huge gains.

So, for the Euro crowd, this is a non-starter.  However, for a family game environment, or for those that enjoy watching the wildness play out (and who are OK striving to manage the chaos), this is a fun game and it's wrapped in a nice short package of setup/play time.

Played a couple of times, once with my daughter and once at a game meetup. The game is easy to get into and the basic mechanic is fine - the idea is that you and other ships are trying to climb out of a gravity well along a linear track, and cards move you towards (and possibly past) or away from the closest ship. The trick is that cards (which are named after elements) are played simultaneously and resolved in alphabetical order, so playing a card is a matter of trying to figure out when your card will be resolved and what ships are likely to be where at that point. No one can get too far in the lead, generally, without having to move backward at some point, so the game stays relatively close. But I found the mechanic a little boring after awhile - the choices feel a bit too simple and limited.

A great filler game that has you guessing and second guessing your opponets. I have enjoyed every game I have played except when I played with a kid. Know one could ever reason why he would do something. This lead all of us to sticking around the warp for two rounds before we realize "we have to play the exact opposite of what we think a normal person should do," when we did that we finally broke free of his dread gravity.

An interesting twist on a racing game. Very popular among my friends. Games play very quickly and there is a cap to the number of rounds that can be played, so even if games are dragging somewhat you know it won't go beyond half an hour or so. I enjoy trying to read my opponents and guess at what they will play. Just as entertaining when you guess wrong than when you guess correctly.

Simple but unique movement system - a great quick filler-that has you scratching your head afterward and wondering if there's any strategy involved or just pure luck.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]This was another game I really enjoyed playing that fell flat with my family (mostly my kids). I really thought the gravity mechanic worked well and there was just enough chaos in the game. I always enjoyed seeing my "brilliant" plan foiled by someone playing a card I didn't expect. I also thought the few card types that either pulled ships toward you or pushed you away from the gravitational pull worked well in mixing up the game play and adding an element of unknown to your play.[/i]
 
[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Great, light family game (my 2 older kids had no problem figuring out the game after 1 play).
- Interesting twist on racing since your movement is tied to the gravity of surrounding ships and how close you are to them.
- The drafting mechanic that begins each round when you choose one face up card and one face down card.
- Plays well with 2, 3 and 4 players.
- Quick: great week night game (plays in 20 - 30 minutes).
- The colors used on the board/ cards.
- My wife enjoys it and has a knack for playing this game well.[/i]

Simultaneous revelation provides your first big hint that this game isn't to be taken too seriously. Your aim is to work the cards so that by the time your movement starts, the closest spaceship is just in front of you, because then you'll move forward. Which means guessing what cards the other players will play (6 Nimmt style), working out whether to play a low-lettered (early) or high-lettered (late) card, and hoping things go well. Or play randomly if that's all too hard, because things often go contra-expectation and wildly out of control. But falling to the back isn't that bad anyway, because it's easy to move back up. Staying up front and moving forward is the tricky bit, relying on leapfrogs and luck and the occasional repulsor card (move away from the nearest ship rather than backwards towards it). Basically eke your way forward with the pack and hope the cards go your way when the opportunity to strike for the winning line emerges. The game's probably too random to be a staple, and comes across as too-big-box to feel like a filler, so it falls on uneven ground - interesting concept to explore but without enough substance to keep you coming back.

What makes it interesting is the cards are played in alphabetical order so a move that may have sent you forward can suddenly move you back. Fortunately everyone has an emergency stop to use once per round... but do you live with a few steps backward now in case something really bad comes up latter?

Each of six rounds of game play starts with a draft of 3 pairs of cards.  We use the option of a mix of face up and face down cards.  Your position will impact your draft choices and the cards you choose to play - but your strategy can be foiled by play order of the cards everyone selects.

Pros:
3 min to teach and 30 min to play
Lots of interaction and excitement

More chaos than control may be off putting to some
Box is larger than it needs to be
Cards may show wear w/o sleeves

To me, this game really felt like 6 Nimmt: The Board Game.  Everyone has to choose one card to play from their hand, and after revealing them simultaneously, they execute in a specific order, and their execution order determines whether you advance or back up on the track.  The addition of the derelict ships is a nice touch that adds another thing to think about when you're choosing a card.  On the whole, this is a pretty enjoyable filler, and I'd be happy to play it again.

This was a fun race game and evaluating the near gravity effects.  I liked how selecting the letter of the card (meaning turn order) was very important to predict or affect your opponents' actions.  Card drafting of selecting one at a time of piles of two (one visible) was good in this as well.

The game seemed to be a little chaotic due to the nature of when your opponents make their moves.  Fun to implement, however can be annoying.

There were games where we kept getting dragged back to the beginning and were not very far toward the warp gate by turn 5 or 6, but somehow someone made it out.  Just for kicks my wife and I house ruled a two player game with a ghost ship because we have been waiting so see a three player game (its either been me and my friend or me and my wife, we haven't been free all together yet) and were surprised.  Not only did the ghost ship (you use in single player rules) add a lot of depth to the two player game, it was actually the winner!  A really great game.

Initially I was a little worried that this would be a rather dry, abstract game. But it turns out that it uses a very dynamic and novel card draft and action selection mechanism that resulted in exciting strategy. For those who like player interaction, there is plenty, but it never devolves into a "take-that" volley that I tend to abhor. Instead, it's more about anticipating your opponents' moves and trying to bluff your way to the most strategic placement of your spaceship. So much fun!

Very clever filler game where you move your spaceship in relationship to the closest object to you. Gets more chaotic with more players, but that's honestly half the fun.  Each round players draft cards that are one faceup and one facedown, and the cards all have different movement speeds and types, so there's this nice tension in trying to deduce what sorts of movements your opponents are capable of. Predict it right and you'll get rocketed ahead of everyone else, predict it wrong and you'll be hurled backwards, which can cause a chain reaction if you suddenly become the closest object to one of your opponent's ships.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Although, it's nicely simple and interactive, I didn't enjoy it much at all. Like 6 Nimmt, you simultaneously play a number card which determines both player order and where that card/your ship goes, and other players' choices can make it go somewhere completely different to where you thought. There are three big differences between them for me: 

1. In 6 Nimmt, turn order and 'movement' are determined by the same number; in Gravwell they're two separate properties of the card. That makes it much easier for me to have a mental picture of what my opponent's capabilities are in 6 Nimmt. For example, I know if there's a stack of 5 with 76 on top of it, that playing 78 is safe as long as no one else has and plays the 77. It's harder to figure that in Gravwell unless you're really supposed to keep referring to the teeny little chart in the corners of the board. 

2. In 6 Nimmt, everyone's making their card choices from the same perspective. Player positions are symmetrical because there aren't any player pieces on the 'board'. In Gravwell, your choice depends on the position of your spaceship. So if I'm really trying to get inside my opponents' heads, I need to think about which card choice would make sense for them given each of their spaceship positions. In 6 Nimmt, part of figuring out what makes sense for me also tells me what makes sense for the other guys.

3. In 6 Nimmt, if you play a card that will put you late in the turn order, you don't have to predict everything that's going to happen before you play your card - some of the cards are unlikely to affect you at all because they'll go on other piles. In Gravwell, even one space difference in movement of another player can make the difference between you going 10 spaces forward and 10 spaces backward, which made it feel extremely chaotic. 

So, I ended up feeling like this. I can take the time to think about where each player is, what cards they might have (and apparently we're supposed to take this seriously, because you get cards in a semi-open draft not a blind deal) and how their possible choices impact my choice, but take way more time over it than feels like is in the spirit of the game. Or I can slap a card down and end up somewhere semi-random. The genius of 6 Nimmt is that I can play in the first way at the speed of the second way. Maybe that comes with repeat plays of Gravwell but I don't think I'll get there.

In this game you draft cards from a common pool, and try and push and pull from and away from gravity to get yourself to the escape. Roll and move with a twist is the best way I think to describe this? Not terrible, but lacking really the enjoyment and engagement to play again with any gusto.

Reminds me of Category 5. With the simultaneous selection and the executing the actions in order determines whether you advance on the track. It provides something of a natural catch up mechanism since the leader has a harder time getting the right card or the order to continue advancing. 

I prefer the emergency stop to be once per game rather than  a round makes it tougher to balance.

I did not much enjoy my one play of Gravwell. The game has a strong rubber banding whereby almost all players will loosely be traveling with each other, so it is very difficult if not impossible to really have a break away winner. The card draft has so much hidden information, you can not really know anything while playing. Overall, I'm fairly convinced that random choices would get you nearly as close to winning as player who are trying their best to win. That makes this game quite boring on the decision and strategy aspect in my opinion.

After one play: I found this playable, but I'm not sure why it's getting the buzz and winning the awards. It was kind of random. I understand that you're supposed to consider what your opponents are likely to do and choose your own actions accordingly, but that wasn't very effective. Too much depends on what hidden cards everybody has.

Great game. I've played a two-player and a four-player game and they are VERY different experiences. There's definitely a lot of paying attention to which cards have been played so you have an idea of whether or not you'll move when you want.

Downside: My copy came with the blue and black ships broken off their stands. We just play with them directly on the board since two pieces can't occupy the same space anyway

#87 on my Top 100 Games of All Time (2015)

Gravwell is all about trying to outthink your opponents by adjusting your play to what you think they are going to do. If that sounds intriguing to you, give Gravwell a shot! If not, you'll likely just find it random and frustrating. I'm in the former camp of people and think this one is great! I picked it up on a whim at a FLGS and was quite surprised. I love games that have simultaneous action selection because I'm super impatient and want to be constantly engaged. In this game, players are trying to be the first to reach the end point on a track with their spaceship- a warp gate to escape the Black Hole. You quickly do a card draft and then simultaneously choose cards to play. Cards look like chemical elements that display a letter and number. Once everyone reveals their card, players move the number of spaces show on the card, starting with the card highest in the alphabet. The trick is that you move those spaces in the direction of the ship closest to you! So if it's your turn to move and there is a ship directly behind you, you will move a number of spaces backwards and further away from victory! It's a really cool idea that is implemented well.

I like this game, both the way it looks and the way it plays. It can be set up super fast, taught quickly, and bookkeeping is minimal during play.  However, it's a tricky game to master since it involves out-thinking and out-maneuvering the other players.  This definitely involves some luck and quite a bit of second-guessing and double-thinking, but it makes for a fun game.  Although there is some chaos involved, the game lasts no more than 8 rounds.  Good luck!

After more plays, I'm not sure that just playing randomly isn't a viable strategy!

Component Note:  Including a game board with a valley fold was a terrible decision considering that this game uses minis on stands and so they slide into the fold and all over and the several spots that the fold crosses... That's just a bad publishing decision.

Random or unpredictable? In my book these are 2 different things. 

Random: made, done, or happening without method or conscious decision.
Unpredictable: not able to be predicted; changeable.

For me, this game is the archetypal unpredictable game. I love the way that everything can be going so smoothly, and one wrong move and you're sailing back to the start. It's highly interactive and really enjoyable, particularly with 3-4 players and I look forward with real anticipation to the expansion that will add in 2 players and increase the hilarity with 3 players heading one direction and 3 the other. Top marks to Corey, the designer.

1 play, 2er

An interesting abstract-y card driven racing game. Players start at one end of a long track (spiral, but really it's a single long line). It plays quickly, but still has a nice bit of think! The game does feel pretty chaotic, though!

Decent fun, but still felt a bit too abstract for me.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
At the start of the game, place 1 (or 2) derelict ship(s) on the indicated space(s).

There are 6 rounds. Each round, create 3n piles of 2 cards, one face up and the other face down. Players take turns choosing 3 of the piles.

Then, players simultaneously choose a card, then reveal. Resolve them in alphabetical order. Cards mostly move you in the direction of the closest other ship (ignore Starting space); others move you away, or move the other ships towards you. All moves are the number of spaces indicated on the card; if you land on an occupied space, move to the next unoccupied space. Repeat until all cards are played, then advance to the next round.

You win by reaching the end space. If no one has done so after 6 rounds, the player closest to the end wins the game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Super duper light and quick game.  The mechanics are clever but overall the game is a bit sleepy.

The board is a large spiral and each player represents a ship that is trying to get to the end, or at least as far as possible before the game ends.  Players move by drafting cards from a grid before each game round, one card is shown and the other is hidden until drafted.  Then during the game round players play these cards simultaneously.  They all have a letter (technically an element but there is one for all 26 letters of the alphabet) and an affect.  The earlier in the alphabet the letter is the earlier the affect happens and the 3 different affects are either move towards the nearest ship, away from the nearest ship, or draw all other ships toward you.

There is some strategy to the game with playing the right letter/affect and remembering what others have drafted however there is also just a lot of randomness, a lot MORE than there is strategy in my estimation that has this game feel like it is mostly just playing itself and hoping you get lucky.

It is super quick though,easy to teach, and like I said, the mechanics are clever.  I just wish more was done with them.

This is another quick-playing game that I held off on buying for years because I was worried that it wouldn't have the legs for repeat plays. When I saw the game marked down at my local game store, I finally decided to give it a try. And I'm very glad I did. It plays fast and fun. While it lacks serious depth, it makes for an exciting experience when you're in the mood for a filler.

The object is to be the first to fly your spaceship out of the grav-well. If you make it to freedom, you win. If not, your ship is trapped forever. Actually, now that I think about it, the premise is a bit grim. Ignore that. Instead focus on the unpredictable card play!

Each turn, everyone simultaneously selects a card and plays it face down. The cards are flipped over and resolved in alphabetical order according to whatever element is listed. Cards do one of three things: fly you in the direction of the closest ship, push you away from the closest ship, or drag everyone else (in either direction) closer to you. From these simple actions comes a mess of chaotic rounds. It's a bit like [thing=18]RoboRally[/thing] when all the robots are close together. You can ride the wave of chaos, but it will take some clever planning and a sense of humor. Luckily, you get one chance each round to cancel out your planned action, but not even that will save you from all your bad fortune -- and that's where the fun resides.

I prefer Gravwell with a full complement of four, but the experience is mostly maintained throughout the player count. Just the right amount of chaos balanced with some thoughtful decisions. Greatly enjoyed it!

I'm an engineer with a minor in physics and my brother has a PhD in astronomy, so the theme of this game lured me in and they really nailed it. You are bouncing around all over the place letting gravity whip you around. It kind of reminds me of the arcade game asteroid. Things are flying around all over the place and you never really feel in control. I also like how the fuel cards are all elements (and I think all but one or two are real elements).

It's a fun, chaotic, light strategy game that captures the theme well. My wife wasn't a big fan so I won't be acquiring it, but I would definitely play it again.

Gravwell is a fairly quick game that I'd probably through into the filler category.  It's got a neat mechanic where movement depends on what's around you and a simultaneous card selection determines whether you are pushing or pulling, but cards are resolved in alphabetical order.  There is some really interesting potential for chaos, especially if the ships are really close to each other.

This game plays pretty quick, and has about the right amount of depth for its length.

I like this game. Especially the first few times. But the nature of it sort of means that despite making better choices than other players, you still have to wait for them to "catch up" in order to win. The most important choices don't happen until the very very end. 

And a player not knowing what to pick and picking randomly can REALLY drag the game down a bit.

Still, it was a lot of fun. Especially as a light weight party game. Haven't played it solo.

I'd been eagerly anticipating this games wider-release since I heard about it after GenCon. The concept of this tactical card-drafting game is that your ship has emerged from the other side of a black hole. In this new dimension, you are reliant solely on the position of nearby objects to pull/push yourself off of. 

Essentially you'll either be playing cards that (a) move you TOWARD the nearest object --[Most of the cards fall into this grouping]; (b) PUSH YOU AWAY from the nearest object or (c) use a tractor beam to PULL ALL OTHER OBJECTS TOWARDS YOU.

You draft the "fuel" cards that you will use to move.. The brilliance of the movement mechanic is that for most of the "fuel" cards you need your opponents to be ahead of you to attempt to jump further ahead of them. There is also a risk/reward because the fuel cards that move you furthest are activated "last", so, you can't be certain WHERE your opponents will be or which has a huge impact on WHICH DIRECTION your Fuel card will propel you. 

It's a wonderful tactical battle where you need to wait for just the right moment to make your move to the Jumpgate to Escape the 9th Dimension (and Win). 

The rules are simple, gameplay is straightforward, but it is much more difficult to master than it might seem. This game plays in 30 min or less. Has an interesting solo variant and plays great with 1-4 players. 

The only reason I docked the Quality is the ships flight stands are fragile...and you'll probably want to sleeve the cards, because the will wear quickly, but otherwise this game is a GREAT VALUE and lots of fun! Highly Recommended

Slight damage to one of the ship figures. Played 2 or 3 times total. All pieces still present, just need minor (glue) repair.

A simple game with a clever theme and design, where you play cards that move you forward and backward, and you have to take into account what your opponents do, as each play will change the position and may make your move do the opposite of what you intend.

This was probably my favorite new game at BGG con this year. Incredibly simple and easy to pick up but a lot of fun. Can't wait for this to come out so I can pick up a copy.

Oct 2017:  -3 rating (to 5)  Not one we feel compelled to play on a regular basis, even as a filler.  It's still an okay game for non-gamers or light gamers, especially if they're into the theme.

A really fun, quick game!  We play with the standard rules, so we always have one visible card and one hidden card when drafting.  Sometimes someone shoots ahead early and we think they're about to win only to see them fall back and someone else end up the winner.  It's somewhat reminiscent of childhood games where you were counting spaces and moving around a board, but with a nice twist that requires some actual strategy.  Easy to teach, nice filler, no complaints!

Need to get more plays in, but a very neat game.  Simple in it's mechanisms, but still requires an interesting, abstract thought process.  Game seems to be a mixture of controlled chaos, laughter, and frustration, hah.  It's a fun activity, but didn't really grab me.

Delivers almost everything I want from a filler.  It's got simple rules, interesting decisions, little downtime, and it's quite fast.  The game is as much about timing as it is about raw power, and the decision of which card to play when is a really interesting one.  You never know exactly what the other players are going to do, but you have a reasonable guess.  There's a great element where getting out ahead doesn't do you much good, because most of the cards will pull you back.  I only wish this went to 5 or 6 players.

Simple to understand, but counter-intuitive to wrap your head around its strategy, Gravwell is a great opener or filler game for folks who can have fun getting tossed around by quirks of fate. Do not play with strategy gamers who take games too seriously.

I was attracted to Gravwell for its rarer themes and mechanics and they certainly paid off. Gravwell is essentially about betting on initiatives, as players guess and second-guess how the state of play will change just before they move, hoping it will be to their advantage, or attempt to beat others to the first play before that state changes.

The colour palate for the game is fantastic and it's short and seemingly chaotic enough that keen players will want to play again. That chaos is an illusion though, as the card-draft, initiatives and state of play all become more readable the more folks want to pay attention to it. I love games that offer this much fun in such short play-times.

Play and move game with abstract strategy. Our ships are out of fuel and must be propelled to the warp gate home by collecting and playing basic element cards. Unfortunately, the ships move either toward or away from the nearest gravitational object (other ships) and depending on the simultaneous turn order, there is a good chance of being propelled in the wrong direction! Play your emergency stop cards wisely. This is purely mad.  And also frustrating is when the tractor beam is played which ultimately drags all players further away from the warp gate. This is a filler/gateway. I usually do not like games that are completely out of my control but this one doesn't bother me. Not sure why?

Surprisingly fun racing game with decent theme. Physics-based movement means you need to slingshot off of the nearest ship, but this can backfire for hilarious results. Enough decisions to be interesting, but enough randomness to be amusing.

RATING: 4.5
Definitely not good as a 2-player game, and really not all that good in general.  Players draft cards each round but only know half of the 6 cards they draft.  Players then have to play cards in order to hopefully move their ship forward, which is incredibly difficult to do.  Ships move in priority order of the cards played and ships move towards the nearest other ship.  This means that you have to guess what your opponents are going to do and hope the priority order makes it so the nearest ship is in front of you instead of behind you.  Most of the time you end up moving backwards just as much as you move forward.

When I played, one player was in the lead all the way up to the final round, and then a single lucky card play allowed another player to win, making it seem as if the first 5 rounds were completely pointless.  The game is far too chaotic and luck based.

A unique, straight-shooting abstract with just enough theme to be interesting.

[i]Gravwell vs. The Great Atlanta Churro Factory[/i] was also a landmark case that set the precedent that sugared cinnamon pastries can result in felony swooning if the eater's tongue becomes overloaded with pleasure.

Which is completely unrelated to [I]Petty Officer Third Class[/I] Gravwell, the brain hemorrhage specialist who would go on to win the Navy Cross for bravery in the face of seals.  Though they were later identified as seal lions by a marine biologist with a keen eye.

Has been described as adult candy land and I feel that this still holds true.

While still fun, it's nothing to write home about. Very chancy and while you can try to track whose taking what cards and plan, it generally just turns into chaos. Will play it if it's on the table, but probably wouldn't bring it out myself.

Super chaotic racing game about flying ships in a black hole. Players hope to get lucky when drafting movement cards, outguess opponents to fly towards the escape gate, and prepare to hit the emergency brake when plans go awry. It's as cheesy as its sci fi film-like name.

I could play this game at any moment. It's so simple, and yet the strategy and the unknown is deep. I don't even know what else to say about it. You feel like you have total control over your ship, but the fact that your actions are entirely dependent on your opponents' actions means you really don't have any control at all. And somehow that's amazing.

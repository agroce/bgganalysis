2016-06-23 (rating 7):

After playing more 18xx somehow this one no longer attracts me as much as it did before.

2011-05-27 (rating 8.5):

A fine game. But it seems to me that way to much depends on the initial auction. It is not bad in itself but facing another 3 hours of play if you know that you are going to lose after the initial auction (which seems to be not so rare) isn't much fun.

A very variable game as companies are born from how the initial auction of private companies goes. Have heard a lot about the initial auction signalling the winner, having played twice now its probably true but i would like to play more; 1861 will probably survive as the better game for making majors out of minors.

RATING: 7
18EU starts with a bang: 15 minors are auctioned and each player would like to end up with a vaguely compatible set, without letting anyone end up with more than their share.  The game is exciting up through about the 4-trains, after which things tend to bod down in route fiddling for an extra 10 here or there.  This is not a dramatic 1830-style game of fighting hard to overcome liabilities -- permanent trains are somewhat plentiful and tend to be quite affordable.  The result is a game that is won or lost on the finer details.  I prefer the volatility of the 1830-branch of the series.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rating based on 1 four player game.  I love the geography of the map, and the components of the deep thought game, but we seemed to have a lot of stations which acted as blockers keeping you from nice long runs.  To me that clogged the board more than I would have liked.

RATING: 9
that people complain this is not replayable is most strange to me... I've had drastically different plays every time. meatiness/time ration is by far the highest of all games I know.

though the drawback is that the game is for the most part decided in the first auction, with 1-2 players almost always out of the game, or someone with a clear lead...

The more I play this one, the more I like it.  It emphasises the things I like about 18xx (tile playing, route optimization) while downplaying or eliminating those I don't (stock manipulation, company looting).  Currently my favorite 18xx.  I know that most die-hards prefer the "tougher" game without the optional trains; however I prefer them with as it gives the minor at least 2 additional ORs of life and softens greatly the otherwise brutal train rush from 3s to 5s (and 6s).

I rate 18EU itself a 9 as with enough plays I think I might tire of it, but as my current favorite of the 18xx system I have given it a rating of 10 to indicate my enjoyment of the 18xx series of games as a whole, which I do feel I will always want to play and don't see changing.

RATING: 7.5
Enjoyable game, but only really works for 3 or 5 players.  Initial auction can determine the outcome, but a well balanced auction leaves plenty of room for building strategy and, especially in the 5 player game, the fact that there are only 8 major corps makes a big difference in game play, with priority becoming huge just before the 5 trains come out.

Edited after quite a few plays Jan 2012: I was completely wrong about only 3 or 5 players.  4 players is now my favorite number, if all are reasonably familiar with the game.  Ending up with 3 minors and $50+ bucks is fine with me if they are good minors (won last weekend with 2 great minors and a dog.)

Pretty good, but the juicy decisions really happen around the arrival of the 4-train, instead of the 5-6 trains like in the average. So the end it kind of bogs down to just making almost irrelevant upgrades and some annoying blocking.

2013-01-15: OMG.  Admittedly it's after only one play, but this may be my new favorite 18XX. The decisions at the beginning of what minors to acquire and whether to get what you want or get several later cheap.  The decision shortly thereafter about when and what to convert into a corporation.  The decisions about big runs versus stock values.  At the end of the game, my company an for $930 with a share value of only $100.  This was an absolutely amazing game!

2013-09-18: I still think it's a great game, but it's one where most of the interesting stuff happens in the initial auction and the first few ORs.  By shortly after the mergers, the game is mostly over, despite having a couple more hours to play.  I'll happily play it, but wouldn't ask to.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A good enough 'xx design - but the flavor isn't to my liking.

More about the long term track (and token) placement than about manipulating the stocks.
May set too much importance on the trains you end up with, and, like 1835, companies are such a valuable commodity that it is seldom worthwhile to get rid of them.
The initial packet is probably the most important decision you make - and it's difficult for a new player to accurately evaluate bidding.

I like how the small company mergers accelerate the beginning of the game as well as providing a fresh setup for each game, but the openning auction can be confusing. Interesting progression and map.

RATING: 5
Off-mainline 18xx games are like Star Wars novels - they have different evaluation criterion than normal books. When viewed as a game, 18EU isn't terribly good - long, tedious in many spots, stereotyped - and is nowhere near being in the same league as 1825, 1830, 1856, or even the less-tight 2038 or 1853. On the other hand, judged solely as an 18xx game, it's not too bad - it's sufficiently different and has a unique flavor. But for anyone who isn't seriously in to 18xx, one to skip.

RATING: 8
The initial auction is extremely interesting.  I can't think of another 18xx experience that is quite like it. 

But the game seems prone to getting dull after the mid-game when all the larger corporations are created. Less room for stock manipulation / shenanigans. Maybe the bank needs to be a bit smaller to add tension to the game?

Still, I look forward to playing again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This is probably one of my lowest rank of 18XX. The game has so much promises, yet fails in delivery. All the tension was when bidding Minor, but then the rest of the games feels flat and dry. The game protects you so much, unfortunately that means protecting your opponents too, making this uneventful game.

Specialities:
- 15 Minors that can (must) merge to make Major companies
- No different zones at stock market (2D)
- Players cannot sell the shares before it operates
- Tracks are very restricted
- May split dividend

I give it twice (for maybe the 1st time is just wrong setup or something), but it didn't improve on 2nd play, so won't likely play again. The game is not too bad, but compared to lot others 18XX, so many titles to play, and so little time to play, making me probably won't play this game again.

RATING: 9
Excellent 18xx title - the best I've played.  The initial auction can make a huge difference to the lines built and the development of the game.  As a result each game is significantly different.  On the downside, the game can sometimes be over after the auction, particularly if someone isn't paying attention.  The only other issue is a tendency to stall when no player stands to gain by bringing on the train rush.

Apart of 18AL this was the 18xx version I liked best (however it was bas on only 1 play). It was fast, it was tense and not too long (about 6 hours).
After 3 games we came down to less than 5 hours. Game is tense, and different every time due to the big number of minors in the beginning.

I have now played this game over ten times and it has become one of my favorite 18xx games.  I really like how the small companies form and are utlized for long term strategies.  The only downside is that a first game of 18EU will take longer than a normal 18xx 'first game'.  I have found that explaining overarching strategy during the rules explaination helps a great deal with the potential beginning game 'analysis paralysis'.  Potential to increase runs each OR by 10 - 20 can lead to an analysis paralysis nightmare.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The opening Minor Company auction has many critical decisions, which means beginners can get into trouble right out of the gate, but it results in a game that can vary dramatically from one playing to another.  There's quite a bit of tactics in the struggle to make sure you get the most value out of your minor companies, and the question is how much that struggle will distract you from your long-term goals.  Furthermore, once you're in trouble, it's very difficult to extract yourself and become a contender again.

Another problem is that the end of the game isn't as interesting as the beginning.

However, I have now played the variant in which you draft special powers, with the stronger powers having higher numbers, and then place companies in order in any open spot (rather than having them go where the numbers are marked on the board.)  This creates more variety, both at the start and the end of the game, and also makes it easier for beginners by eliminating the initial auction.

RATING: 7.5
A very good 18xx.  Seems both more interesting and shorter than most 18xxes, though more of the game then usual is in the early game.  Edit 2007: Too much of the game is the initial auction, it seems.  The initial order draw also persists in affecting the game for far too long
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
18EU features a large initial auction with 15 minor companies. In theory, that should make games play out rather differently simply due to a different distribution of those companies. I'm not sure that really is true, however, since most of those minors have very clear "best" routes which channel the tracks in similar patterns.

The rather static stock market (including the ability for companies to sell their own shares to the market) and the tile set are both pretty forgiving, with the exception of Y cities which can be used to create choke points.

Overall, the game seems less dynamic than many other 18xx titles, and it ends sooner in the sense that little of particular interest happens in the later stages of the game.

We used to play this a lot when it first came out, but I rarely see it played these days.
The game has several good features: lots of combinations possible with the start packet of 15 minors, a flow from minors to majors, and route-building is just as important as the finacial aspects.
The game does have some flaws: a fierce train rush (and possible poison 4-train), no compensation for minors unconnected to a major, and initial seating order can determine the game. Also, the 4-player game can be problematic at the start since 15 just doesn't divide by 4.
Largely superceded by 18Ardennes.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My biggest criticism is that the game can be won or lost on the initial auction- some experience is necessary to avoid handing someone the game (or losing it) before it even really starts.  However, this is a minor criticism for a game with huge replayability.  Chrome doesn't get in the way of the game as with some Hecht designs, although it does have the usual trappings of a Hecht design (operations matter much more than any stock shenanigans).

There's nothing about an 18xx game that provides me any form of enjoyment, and so the prospect of spending another three hours(at minimum) per session at least half a dozen more times just to progress past the conscious incompetence stage is unappealing. The strategies and tactics of this genre will forever remain opaque to me.

RATING: 7.5
This game seemed the least new player friendly of the 18xx games I've so far played, since it seemed like even more of the important decisions than usual happen right at the beginning. I didn't play with the special power cards, I'm really curious to see how those mix things up, though I don't see that eliminating my front loading concern to much. Still a lot of fun.

RATING: 7
Difficult to go bankrupt but very easy to screw up hopelessly. The outcome of the initial auction likely will have eradicated some player's chances. Getting no 3 trains or having to buy more than one 4 train is another killer. Finally, lots of prepaid markers and a restricted tile mix can end hopes as well.
Even more than in other 18xx's it's only fun if you're on the right side of the stick. Here, you even don't have the hope of going bankrupt as your sucking companies can sell unsold shares to the pool to get additional money and locomotive prices aren't too high (800 for the 8 train as the largest train).
Lots of unique design choices though and when things workout I can imagine that this could be one of the more satisfying 18xx's. Best with more players and has a comparably long play time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
One of my top 5 18xx games in the number of plays, but not really in how much I appreciate the design. The minor company auction makes sure that the game doesn't get stale quickly. The game has a few problems though. 

The main one is that there's no "right" player count. In 3p, the initial random order selection basically also fixes the operating order of the major companies, so the player in the 3rd seat very often gets screwed when it comes to 3Ts. In 4p, it's incredibly hard to win as the player who ends up with only 3 minors, no matter how good. In 5p, it's basically impossible to win with just one company.

Different viewpoint on 18xx -- corporations can only be started by exchanging minor companies, with the emphasis more on optimizing your runs rather than stock manipulation or aggressive track laying.

18xx in Europe. The initial auction of the 15 minor companies is crucial; you can loose the game already at this stage (try to get two minors close or in connecting range of each other - try to get as much minor companies as you can get, while keeping the first guideline in mind - Benelux and Germany are the best starting locations; the south is poorer in cash return). As usual, try to swap money between (minor) companies to buy a 3 (or 4) train. Don't wait too long to merge your minor companies, because otherwise you'll get it really difficult to buy trains and control track. After the merge: go for one of the smaller permanent trains, but also aim for the 8 train. Timing: try to get priority deal when the last major companies come up for sale.

RATING: 3
One of my favorite 18xx games.  This game features minor companies that can lay track and operate 2 trains.  They are then used to open the major companies.  Would see more play if not quite so long.  Rating assumes there is enough time to play.

Downside can be that the game is won and lost in the initial auction.

Tentative rating after one play. Seems like a very good member of the 18XX family. A lot happens at start when there are 15 small companies, then it calms down a bit as
they merge into corporations. The mountain chain felt quite useless, as there didn't seem any incentive to build through it.

A very interesting 18xx game with quite a few wrinkles even for experienced 18xx players.  There is a dutch auction at the beginning of the game for minors.  Working this auction properly is essential because these minors establish starting positions for your entire game.  What this means is that your second game will be much better than your first! LOL.

At this time, I think that 18EU has a lot of intensity and is one of my favorite 18xx games, but it is a longer game than for example 18Mex so this won't hit the table as often.

rating based on 2 Rails plays.  Still have not gotten my printed copy to the table.  The starting auction is interesting.  The game is engaging through the midgame, but the end game seems to bog down.  Feels like it is pretty much decided by mid-game and is just playing itself out.

Not my favorite 18xx title, but one that I wouldn't turn down.

This is the game that got me to like 18xx games.  It is a very fun game but a lot depends on what goes on in the opening auction.  If you bid too much for a minor company it can hurt you the rest of the game.

Intriguing. The initial stock round means a lot and is really difficult for new players to understand, which makes 18EU a bit complicated. The balance between Paris, Berlin and south of the Alps is questionable. I will need to play this one a bit more!

I enjoyed the game after finishing this game; however, first time out, I was confused since it was my first 18xx game and I had a hard time seeing how everything work together for long term growth. Although I ended up winning in the end by concentrating all my efforts on one company (which was the strongest the whole game) and buying 40% of the shares of all the strongest rivals. I was also able to ruin the plans of all the other players with an early first rust. It was my first time out so it was a "friendly" game but if I played it again I think I would be able to play very competitively; however, the fun to time ratio was not good so I will likely try Chicago Express before I play this again.

Nice, simple 18xx. Similar to 1830 complexity, minus the privates, plus a few extra features:
*Pullman cars (double the value of one city)
*Half dividends, 
*Minor companies (they only lay yellow tiles and always pay a half dividend, no stock value, may be traded in for a share of a regular company. incremental capitalisation, simpler track tiles, 
*red to red runs, 
*Y-cities, 
*ports (just like a $10 town)
and some other minor tweaks.
The midgame does feel less dynamic/interesting than 1830.

RATING: 8
This is an good route building 18xx with a "minor companies merging into majors" theme.  Its not a stock-market game (I've never seen a company dump).  I really like train games that stand on a merger mechanic like this.  18EU seems to be on of the simplest of such games, and is focused most directly on the merger theme. Actually, it has the simplest ruleset of [i]any[/i] 18xx that I know of.

Playtime: ~3-4 hours

Comment: This one is unique. It's got some mergers, plenty of starting variability and most of the companies feel like their a good starting point. The game however is a bear to first get into. Not knowing how the game plays out until your about 1/2 way through makes this game one of the more steeper ones to first learn. I'd only bring this out with experienced players. We'll see how the train rush feels in this game. I got screwed over the first game of it, but I'm not sure how well that translates to an actual game of it.

Optimal Player Count: 4

Plays well with all counts except for 2. Typically with 18xx games you'll want 1 player less than max and 1 player more than minimum.

It's too long, the private auction can determine the winner before you even lay any track, and the game, I'm sorry, simply doesn’t work out of the box with 4p since there are only 15 minors and whoever only gets 3 is at a serious disadvantage. The minor auction is also interminably long, which is unacceptable given how long and tedious and processional the rest of the game is. 

I don't like how stocks fall one value no matter how many shares are sold, and I don't like how the game is really "About" maneuvering to get these massive E-W runs that pay out huge sums. Some people enjoy this game, but it really spotlights everything I don't really enjoy about 18xx, as I'm less interested in the operational aspects of the genre. 18xx has the reputation of being "long" and "mathy," and to me that is more evident in the operational games (i.e., the ones where you have to run good companies and make your money through dividend payouts, with little cross-investing and stock value manipulation). The problem is that operational games lack the same dynamic range that the more stock-centric games have. 

Operational games, or games that are "about" timing the mergers of minors into majors, simply have to be in the 2-3 hour range for me. There are too many 4-6 hour richer, more dynamic 18xx games that I'd choose over this one.

RATING: 7
Smorgasbord 18xx. Lots of chrome and bizarre rules that make a coherent and very playable whole!

This isn't in the same league as my favourite 18xx titles: 1841 and 1830.

By far the best parts of this game:

* The initial auction is a lot of fun! I prefer the idea of auctioning minor corporations that differ only by geographical location and turn order. I think it's much more elegant than private companies whose special rules are easily forgotten since those are generally used once per game.

* Because there are so many running corporations at the beginning of the game, the opening game is quick (as opposed to many other 18xx titles)

* The large amount of running corporations at the start of the game means that players can indulge in 18xx style money laundering right from the start (i.e. being able to transfer assets from one corporation to another). This is by far my favourite aspect of 18xx games.

I thought much of the chrome of 18EU wouldn't add much to the game, but I was pleasantly surprised this was not the case:

* The Pullman cars added an interesting decision mid-game where you would have to choose between dumping that and an old train. What's even more interesting is that Pullman cars are most useful at the beginning at the end, but the decision to dump them happens at mid-game.

* Red-to-red bonuses based on the number of your tokens along the route make track laying even more competitive.

* The "simplified" tracks aren't that simple! The upgrade paths of many of the tiles (in particular, the Y cities) make track laying quite tricky.

* Half-dividends and the ability for corporations to buy and sell their own stocks allow you to raise money quickly without having to resort to emergency money raising.

However, my favourite 18xx tiles offer a more meatier challenge than 18EU (although I'm not one to judge since I came in last place in my first game).

* Although auctioning the fifteen minor corporations is a lot of fun, operating them isn't (until you start merging them into other corporations). Minors are restricted to playing only yellow tiles. Yes, this enables the board to fill up faster with yellow tiles, but I prefer the auction for full-fledged corporations in 1841, in which you are faced with very meaty decisions right from the first operating round.

* 18EU majors are partially capitalized (before phase 5), but they cannot operate until 50% of their shares are in players' hands. I prefer the tension that 1856 creates in which corporations can operate with as little as two shares. Consequently, in 1856. corporations are constantly trying to get their shares sold. In addition, in 18EU, dividends from unsold shares go in the corporation's treasury, providing corporations a slightly bigger cushion if they are unable to get all their shares sold.

* Note that many other 18xx games such as 1830 prevent corporations from starting until they have at least 50% of their shares sold. What makes 18EU less exciting than 1830 -- but more forgiving -- is that the trains in 18EU are much cheaper. It appears easier to have all corporations at their train limit earlier in the game. This enables players to build up some capital to prepare for a new corporation starting, that new corporation buying a train, and finally the rusting of old trains to create space for new and better ones.

* In addition, the mergers in 18EU are limited to minors merging into a major only when the major starts, or at the beginning of phase 5. I much prefer the freedom of 1841 that allows mergers anytime, or in 1856, in which in debt corporations must merge into the CGR at a specific time in the game, which adds such a huge strategic and narrative force to the game.

* Track laying is far less frustrating, but less challenging, since it's much easier to build around cities. Out of all 18xx games I've played, I prefer 1856's track laying since it offers a board with a relatively high density of cities and towns and track tile shortages.

So 18EU falls in an uncomfortable middle region: it's too long to play casually. I often play games at a university cafeteria on weekends with a gaming group. It's easier to spontaneously suggest a shorter 18xx title like 1830 or 18AL (if I actually had a copy) than 18EU, which lasts about 6h. (There is no way I'll find the time to play 18EU often enough to drop this to 3h.) But if I want to plan an entire game of 18xx, I'd rather play a meatier one like 1856 or 1841.

18xx are great games. Lot's of starting companies (lots). Lots of opportunities to start your own company. Definite distinction between opening and end game (like in most/all 18xx, but here it definitely shows in stock policy). Crazy route building because of the large map. A game that is so great the headaches are included in the box.

Initial auction is the most important/interesting part of the game.  Take a look at the minor companies guide posted on the 18xx Yahoo Group.

RATING: 6.5
Decent but somewhat outdated 18xx title.  The game is mostly won/lost based on the initial auction of the minors.  There is a nice variant in the 18EU files section that improves the game a bit by adding special powers and modifying the initial auction.  The result is that players who take the stronger special powers have to take weaker starting cities which helps to balance out the board.

The information for the special powers variant is below and significantly improves the game, making it around a 7 for me instead of a 6.5

An interesting 18xx variant that works a bit differently than most - enjoyable but not as much as other games in the series.
Adding to my "to build" list. Maybe after 18AL.

This is a really crazy twist on the 18xx system.  I really love the way that the minors work and how they shape the way the board comes together.  Theoretically, this will play different every time (as people will be starting the game with different minors).  But, I fear that the map channels things too much.  There are very clear places to build track and the lines are shuttled straight through with little incentive for variation.  That said, I suspect that with more play I will discover that I may be wrong.    

The tile upgrades are crazy - with the "Y" towns requiring turns and the standard cities requiring straight tiles.  So many frustrating moments when you realize that tiles just aren't going to work the way that they should, but at the same time, it makes for a rewarding little puzzle.  

Because of the "Y" upgrades, there are a number of crazy choke points.  Often you are building around cities and making gigantic runs across the board with three trains. 

The bonus to a run from Off Board Location to Off Board Location is so huge.  Because of this, you lose the noodly nature of your standard 18xx shipping network for long straights.  The tile mix also encourages this.  Unfortunately, I think that the track building suffers a bit because of it.

Still, all in all it is very different from your regular 18xx game, and most of the changes are so entertaining that it more than makes up for what is lost.

Self made PnP. A good 18xx although ISR takes too long (at least when played in Rails). One problem is that some players (even experienced) can screw up their game already during ISR and the game itself can turn very boring. Try to get red-to-red runs as early as possible!

My first 18xx and I really like it. This game introduced a whole new way of board gaming to me as you really need to plan sessions well ahead and find people to play with, however, this is also the disadvantage: you (or better: we) cannot play it in 1-2 hours. My best pnp game ever as well.)

On the minors (an element which is typical for this 18xx title):
-themewise it's awesome
- it is fun to play, however, I am not quite sure if it's really worth the extra time before the actual game starts (Sometimes we need an hour for the minor auction!!).
Poker chips are in use!

very fluid 18xx without private co's, red to red runs and pullman cars seems interesting, there's also a fast train rush ----  my favorite 18xx so far (still have a ways to go to sample most of them)

beware the initial auction, takes a few plays to get the hang of

Played 2 times.  I like the minors and I like the auction and I like the growing up of companies.  The initial track laying with all the minors isn't very exciting and so I'm not super fond of this game.  It could grow on me.  I think I like the minors and growing in 1861 better. 2009/10/04

I don't have a ton of experience with 18xx (yet), but this struck me as a very good game.  I like the minor companies and the way they merge into the majors, although with one game under my belt I'll probably value them differently the next time I play.  There are some definite pitfalls to avoid.  The restrictive track options, expecially for the "Y" cities can be frustrating but challenging.  It definitely pays to plan carefully when it comes to track laying.

An interesting game that can sometimes be mostly decided in the opening bidding for RRs; it really needs a second, mid-game layer to be a great game.

Perhaps, 12 opening RRs and 6 mid-game RRs to merge with a la 1861 would be a better game?  Mostly, I just think 1861 does this better.

Note : PRINT AND PLAY. A simple version strongly similar to 18Ardennes. Ownership of this if you have 18Ardennes is, IMHO, not necessary; 18Ardennes fired 18EU.

My first "big" 18xx games (Played only 18AL and so-called 18xx "Baltimore & Ohio"). Very interesting bidding for private companies. Mergers are solved here in an intereting way and works great.

For now I can be convinced to play any 18xx games but what I don't like in those games is handling money - you have to give change, count percentages etc all the time. It's really tiring. And at the end of the game counting again and again how much your company earns for it's trains. I would like to play with some good software that counts money, or with good online implementation. Than those games would come to only it's core mechanisms which are really great! 

On the other hand: If I think that in the same time I can play both Through the Ages and Le Havre..... ;)

While I'm still at an early stage in my experiences with the 18xx games, 18EU has got to be the meatiest one I've tried thus far.  Although the rules for the most part are fairly similar to the others, there are some particularities pertaining to the merging of minors that warrant a thorough understanding.  I know that we got several of them wrong and had to restart the game because of it.

Generally I've always felt that the beginning plays of most 18xx are fairly scripted.  Companies with a fixed starting location never really deviate much on how their tracks are built to start their income.  Usually it isn't until the mid-game when things really get interesting.  Not so in 18EU.  Due to the fact that there are 15 minors to be auctioned off, how you play the first couple of OR really depends on what companies you end up with and whether they have synergy with each other or not.  So right off the bat this gets a big thumbs up from me.

The next big shocker comes when the first 5-train is sold, since all minors at this point are forced to merge into existing majors, they can no longer grow up by themselves.  Therefore, if you have one that isn't connected to any, it simply goes poof and disappear.  This has the potential of leaving chunks of the map with tracks built but no one to operate, basically pockets of vacuum free for the taking.  Another interesting twist I haven't seen before.

18EU takes a lot of the familiar mechanics and adds its own brand of personality into them, making the gameplay feels fresh and unique.  It's definitely a favorite for me at the moment, but it is also long, not for the faint of heart nor the short on time.

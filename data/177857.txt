Just an abomination. As a fan of the book I'm utterly confused and shocked of how bad this game is comparing to its written equivalent.
Sad, sad day for Achaia fans... :(

This is just not my style. If you like games in which at any given moment you can throw a card and make any player suffer then Achaja is probably for you. But for sure not for me.

Played on Red Imp stand Essen 2016. Neat card and dice area control. Slightly put off by the very good but at times gruesome artwork.

Too much chaos for me.  If you take the Intrigue phase out of Spartacus and made a full game out of it with some dice manipulation, you would get this.  Not a bad game, just not for me.

Just played it once. At some point the game felt like it should be ending soon and then somehow carried on far too long which was not fun.

Would give it another try.

Just WOW! This game was really something. I will not comment on mechanisms and other technical stuff but just on the gameplay and fun that it gives. We sat in a five player team and the game showed us its real potential I guess. It's one of these games where you can be out there in the woods, in the last place, and in the "final hour" turn everything upside down, just with a bunch of repeatable cards and enough wits. I've noticed that it is a bad idea to play with a big hype towards the main goal from the very beginning. The true goal of the game is to plot against others and mislead them with your false moves. So that at the very end, when everybody thinks you're going to finish last you just play a few crucial cards, diligently kept from the beginning and WHAM! Everybody just sits with their mouths and eyes wide open watching you making the route towards your victory. The most essential thing of this strategy is to find the exact moment to do so. Otherwise you can find out that haste makes waste or just start finishing too late. This is very crucial, the feeling of the moment, situation. Just perfect. This is the beauty of ACHAIA, this feature makes it really interesting and makes me want to play it again.

I've played Achaja on Pyrkon Game Con in April 2015.

My opinion on this game isn't very good. I like a theme very much, becouse I enjoy books about Achaja.

The whole idea of this game is exelent! Backstabbing and mean moves really give this game a proper feel. BUT...

The whole machanism of the game is just not working. Achaja is full of really good ideas or well copied machanisms, but all this little things just not working together towards a well design fun game. Everything is chaotic! It's hard to be preapared for your oponents moves and it's even impossible to plan something on future turn. Everything in this game is unsure and unbalance. 

I've played game of 5 players. After 2nd turn I already knew that Achaja isn't for me and since then my decisions was complitly random. At the end I was second! I've nearly won the game siting there bored and making unconsidered moves. 

In my opinion this game should get more development. Maybe final product will be better, but I seriously doubt it.

TO CHAOTIC!!!

Weird game with lots of take that.  My friend had good luck with the dice (6/7 six rolls) to deflect my carefully planned attack.  Luck shouldn't be able to derail a strategy like that.

Played prototype at Pyrkon Game Con.

The game of power and treachery, full of negative interaction between players, who are the leaders of political fractions fighting for the throne of deceased king. Seize the political control over most areas of the capital to ensure that you will rule the kingdom. It's the race with one winner, and winner takes it all!

Game is based on dice management, where dice represent your influences over certain areas of capital. The highest result controls the area. Surprisingly, rolling is very limited, instead you have a lot of possibilities (from cards and locations you control) to manipulate the results, both on your and your enemies' dice or even to reallocate dice from one area to the other.

Area majority with directed spite and high variance randomness.  So, roll high and hope nobody else decides to pick a fight with you.  With a bit less randomness, this could be a nice politics-heavy area-majority game.  Instead, the game is too random to be political, too political to be strategic, and too complex to be quick.

I was hoping for more thematic integration to the source material (novel).  The game likes the image of a naked slave girl on a throne manipulating courtly intrigue.  But the gameplay is just players playing politics, with nothing alluding to or feeling like a nobody taking an unlikely and bloody rise to power.  So, the art (which could indicate a unique and powerful theme) appears to simply be a titillating image on a bland game.

Almost every move you make is a 'take that' to another player. Uselessly vulgar art (there's a single card that just goes WAY past the line for no reason), the risque art is generally fine with that one exception, but it's very clearly fan service.  

I did enjoy the mechanisms, but there were several rounds where we literally just undid what the other was doing.  Very one step forward two steps backwards.

Wrażenia po pierwszej rozgrywce dość mieszane. Klimatu świata przedstawionego specjalnie nie poczułem. Są co prawda postacie, wydarzenia, czy ilustracje, które się weń wpasowują, ale miałem wrażenie, że tylko tyle. Grałem na 2 graczy, cała plansza była zapchana już na samym starcie. Bardzo niewielkie możliwości przemieszczania kości. Głównie możemy zmieniać ich wartości, przerzucać, kraść złoto. Dość w sumie też niewielkie możliwości kontrowania intryg przeciwnika (no i zdecydowanie za drogie imho). Daję jej co prawda jeszcze szansę, upewnię się, że nie graliśmy źle, ale na ten moment mnie nie przekonuje, choć nie wykluczam, że może się to jeszcze zmieni.

Dice placement, area majority and chaotic take-that hand management.  Might be too chaotic to be good but requires more plays to say for sure.

RATING: 7
Obscure setting - at least for Americans - as it's based on a Polish novel. This is off the charts on interactive spite. Play cards to gain control of areas, but other players can completely move you around and alter the board - as can you.  There are defensive measures, but can't always employ them. Be ready for chaos - but it is player driven.

Very abstract dice manipulation game with 'take that' element - definitely not for me. I played it once - it made me a bit impatient (too slow gameplay) and slightly bored (no interesting decisions). In the end I run out of time and left just before the last round and I won anyway... that's not a good recommendation.

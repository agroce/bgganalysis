5 plays / 2,3,4,5 players

LIKE: Interesting, different card game about having to play cards in higher values and sets.
DISLIKE: Seems heavily luck dependent on the starting hand. Best with 5 players, ok with 4.

OVERALL: Trying to get yourself Abluxxened to get new cards is not easy. Played with 5 players and the game was much much much better, because there were more options in grabbing new cards if you Abluxxen someone. Lesser player counts, it's not nearly as good, as your chances to get new cards diminishes.

RATING: 5
Short game, nice for vacation or traveling. It's really easy to teach, but has not much depth in that regard. Luck dependency is fairly high in this game, but there are some tactical choices to make. If you don't like people stealing the stuff/points you just put out, this game is not for you. Because this is the main mechanic.

In short:
• light, easy to learn game
• really luck depended
• not much depth

Fun little card game a friend of mine brought me from Germany where it won a spiel in 2014. The premise is a little different than other trick taking games in that you can lose tricks you gained in prior turns when players play the same number of higher suited cards in subsequent turns. It is called, "Abluxxing!" Which is no end of fun to shout at each other each time you do it during play. The face on the suits reminds me of a snarky starfox from the snes game back in the day, so there's that to like too.

I played this game just twice, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Linko is a fairly entertaining card game. It might not shine for its artwork, which is very minimalistic, nor for innovation but it's a fairly enjoyable experience. The mechanism that forces you to take back your cards if a player beats your set make this game actually quite interactive and offers some interesting choices.

It's nothing to write home about, but it's a good way to spend a few minutes, if what you're searching for is some simple card play.

Pretty much my perfect filler.  The rules can be explained in moments; the only tricky element is the options around snatching.  Within a simple framework are some interesting decisions, mostly relating to the timing of collecting and getting rid of cards, but thought is also required about what is needed to entice or to prevent a snatch.  A hand of Abluxxen plays quickly and leaves me cursing my bad luck/poor judgement.  Splendid.

Card quality is OK.  The artist could have done so much more with the cunning lynxes theme.  The rules are fine.

Very clever card game, love that tactile feel of 'set collection' by discarding into a pile that you stack, and the constant thinkiness of the snatching mechanic. Just a really great design from Kiesling and Kramer, simple to grasp, but there's plenty to it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
While the game feels like a trick-taking/climbing card game, it manages to break that mold in a surprisingly good way. What sets this game apart is the snatch-mechanic which allows players to take/deny VP but also introduces a bluffing element as a player may intentionally want their cards to be snatch (so they can re-snatch and/or take valuable cards from the pool). Furthermore, this game is built upon a foundation that rewards thoughtful play and gives players useful information to work with; by paying attention to what has been collected and what sets have been played, you can understand how safe various plays are and predict when the game will end. The end result is a filler that feels refreshing, has tension, and maintains to be engaging from beginning to end. 

That being said, I wouldn't recommend the official 2-player variant as (1) it makes the game more fiddly, (2) removes much of the tension/bluffing in the game, and (3) makes the game develop oddly (players are likely to take a lot of time in the beginning, to plan out their hand against the shadow player, and little towards the end). Perhaps most disappointing is that the randomness is felt more in the 2-player game; depending on how well one's hand meshes with the shadow player's hand, it isn't difficult to predict the winner... and that's before any cards have been played. Overall, it works but feels dumbed down.

It’s unusual to get blown away by a new game, but just when you thought all new card games were derivative of existing games, this new game Abluxxen comes along.  Full of original ideas for scoring points on card count, targeting opponents and replenishing your hand.  Lots of delicious choices, whether to try to 'bank' a large number of cards early, whether to sequester your opponent’s cards or let them retrieve them, when to play your joker, if you are lucky enough to get one.  Very impressive piece of work from the old master Kramer and his partner Kiesling.

Two player variant excellent also - my partner describing as Abluxxen on steroids.  

All games played represents best to 50 points - usually about 4 games.

What?!? The fabled duo K&K designed a simple card game that's even playable with two ordinary decks of cards?
I of course had to buy it.

The rules are as simple as you can imagine: play groups of same-valued cards and empty your hand. When you play the same number of cards of a previous player, you can "snatch" their cards, causing a tempo swing.

The game is clever, fast, and quite subtle: you want to be snatched sometimes to refill your hand.

A great filler!

Quick playing filler with some substance where you are trying to play sets of cards to your tableau on the table for points. The game ends when a player gets rid of all of his cards or when the deck runs out. The score is the number of cards played minus the number of cards left in your hand. The tricky part is getting more cards into your hand to play bigger sets to the table while at the same time trying to get rid of your cards. 

Quick and clever with a small dose of randomness; although it felt like the better player should win.

A very simple card game of playing sets of cards to the table, trumping other players to collect their cards to form bigger sets, while also hoping to not be trumped yourself.

Players play until someone goes out, with points being scored for cards played to the table vs. cards you got stuck with in your hand.

A good, simple, quick card game that anyone could easily play.

I feel like the gaming community used to be a little more accepting of abstract card games, but in the past couple of years they seem to have fallen out of favor. And that's a damn shame, because the good ones are really easy to get into and make for a lot of quick fun. Linko! is one of those games that's so simple and fun you wonder how nobody thought of it before.

It sort of plays like a super confrontational rummy variant. The rules are pretty straightforward, but decisions are interesting with lots of opportunities for clever play and taking risks. I have to say this is one of the more interesting hand management games to come out in quite awhile - there's fun mental hoops surrounding the best way/time to build your hand.

I like this better with more players, but I enjoy 2p as well. Not sure where I stand on the "duel" variant vs. the original rules for 2p yet - it's a little extra bookkeeping and sometimes less interaction (we've had whole games where we only steal from the dummy hand), but it does give you more options.

Hope this sees a wider release in the US - it totally deserves more love! Wish that box was smaller though.

RATING: 9
A nice little card game with interesting hand management and cardplay decisions. I've never played anything that has the central mechanic of stealing the played cards of other players - it felt very fresh to me. It is flat out fun as well. In the great card game tradition, I think it could be played casually and analytically by those in the same game, and not really ruin the enjoyment of either, which makes it a perfect family game. 

Needs to be played over multiple rounds. 

Raised to a 9. It doesn't fit into any of the established card game genres, but feels like a classic card game nonetheless. This game deserves to break out. Easy to play, with very interesting and multi-layered decisions - manipulation of your opponents is crucial to success. Just excellent.

In fact, I'm quite sure this will be a '10' for me if I can get in some regular play.

Very unique little card game. It’s a bit trick taking, a bit Rummy, a bit »hand building«. Some may not understand what is really going on in this game after the first plays, but the better it gets.

Meh. Non-sensical card game in which players rely far too much on the hand of cards they got at the beginning of the game to be fair or interesting. The ordered system which sees cards with higher numbers being strictly better than cards with lower numbers subsequently deals the coup de grâce. Played a few games under protest, hope that it stays that way. This sort of filler is not my forte. (And before you complain: yes, I am aware of little tricks such as 'inviting' others to luxx ab your cards in order to improve your hand towards larger and more resillient sets, 'protecting' weak sets with strong sets, 'memorising' the cards people are taking, etcetera. It isn't rocket science. Say hello to the initial card draw just the same.)

Back to backed this 4 times on it's first play and the people I was playing with didn't want to put it away, which is always a good sign. When I got it out, they looked at the cards and arched an eyebrow at me as if to say "you want me to play what?", but that was soon washed away when they found out how hateful the game is. Played exclusively at 3, but I can see this being incredible at 4 or 5. It's already pretty amazing at 3.

Fun card game that takes a few hands to get a handle on.

In dit spel probeer je zoveel mogelijk kaarten voor je uit te leggen. Elke kaart die voor je ligt levert aan het einde van het spel pluspunten op, elke handkaart is een minpunt.
Als je aan de beurt bent mag je een willekeurig aantal kaarten afleggen van dezelfde waarde. Wanneer je hetzelfde aantal kaarten maar met een hogere waarde aflegt dan één van je tegenstanders, dan mag je kiezen:

- Of je neemt die kaarten van je tegenstander en je tegenstander neemt hetzelfde aantal nieuwe kaarten
- Of je neemt de kaarten niet, dan moet je tegenstander zijn kaarten zelf terug op hand nemen OF deze op de aflegstapel leggen en hetzelfde aantal nieuwe kaarten nemen.
Kaarten die je op deze manier hebt verworven kan je in een volgende beurt misschien in een grotere combinatie afleggen.

Het spel eindigt als de stapel op is of als één van de spelers geen handkaarten meer heeft.

- kaarten zien er saai uit
- geen thema

I haven't made up my mind if you can be good at this game or if there's a lot of luck involved in the outcome of a round. But since I've discovered some new tricks every time I played Abluxxen and the same people seem to win over and over again, I would say that there's at least some skill involved in winning a round. 

It's definitely a game card I wouldn't mind playing more often.

A fun trick taking game that gets better with time.  Although the overall strategy remains constant, the timing of when you execute your moves depends on the board configuration and this has kept the game fresh for me after many replays.  It's a thinking strategy game more than a fixed strategy game.  Someone in the lead can be taken out at the end of the game if you play your cards right :)

A bit "wonky" at first, but after one game, you start to see the deeper strategy hidden in this simple card game.  Played with kids and grandparents, so gets the "family" approval rating.

RATING: 8
Very nice card game where players are trying to accumulate points by playing cards onto the table.  On a turn, one or more cards can be played - but they must all be the same value.  Once played, if you have played the same number of cards as another player, and your card value is higher, you snatch them away from the owner.  The player may take them, or give the owner the option of taking them back or discarding.  When someone goes out, points are scored for every card on the table, and points lost for every card still in hand.  

This one is very good - simple to teach, but quite deep with some nice tactics to think about.  It doesn't quite feel like anything I've played before.  Highly recommended.

It's pretty hard to take a generic set of cards numbered 1-13 and come up with something new.   But Kramer/Kiesling have done it.   You are melding sets of 1 or more cards into a stack, but higher valued sets of the same size "attack" other player's stacks, which allows you to steal cards from them and force them to draw.   A little unfamiliar to learn, but after one hand all is clear.

[b][FirstPlayOn22ndApril2014][/b] I can see the appeal in this game. Some people will hate and some will like it. I was a little lukewarm before I get to try it but then I was surprised at how much I like it. I know Eric Marin is obsessed with this game, and so I was hoping that I'm going to like it too. Good thing that I did.

It's a very simple game, where you are trying to get rid of the cards in your hand. Doing so will also end the game. It's set collection, with a bit of screwage thrown in. The screwage is not really mean actually.

On your turn, you play a set of identical cards (each card shows number on them), where the longer the set is, the better and harder it is for your opponent to force you to take them back. When you play a certain valued set that is higer than your opponent (which comprised of the same value and same number of cards), you get to choose to take the set or forces him/her to decide to take it back into hand, or draw from the display pile. 

You keep doing this until one player finishes all his/her card. Every card played in front of you is worth one point and then you deduct your points with the number of cards still in hand.

Simple game, and I like it for what it is. Plus, it's from Kramer&Kiesling duo, so that is something.

Innovative interaction with a quite basic set of cards: only numbers from 1 -13 (8 times) + 5 jokers. Easy to play, hard to master. Control differs a lot depending on player number and the number of "plays" (each in about 15 Minutes) you play until the final scoring.

Not another card game surely?   But wait, Abluxxen isn't just another card game.   For a start it is designed by two designers producing some of the hottest Euro games at the moment.  And further, it isn't based on trick-taking, nor is it a rummy-derivative, nor a climbing card game.  Then what is it?  What it is is an incredibly inventive, incredibly simple, yet incredibly tense and incredibly enjoyable game based on playing sets of numbers.  You play a set of a single number from your hand.  The set can be any size.  If someone else has played a set of the same size in the previous round AND if that set is of a lower number, then you have ABLUXXENED them.  And so our deep and rich language gets deeper and richer as a new adjective enters our realm.  When you Abluxxen a player you can take their set, or make them take it back.  Whatever, it is good news for you and bad news for them.  

It's fun, there is no denying that.  You will laugh playing this, make no mistake.  Laugh the way you do when playing Love Letter.  

It is what gaming should be all about.

egyszerű, de ötletes szabály:
A 13 lap az elején kézbe mindenkinek, lerakás: vagy 1 db tetszőleges vagy x darab azonos számú - eddig pl. csacsis- de: a lapot magam elé teszem, és teljesen mindegy előző körben mennyit és milyet tettem le, ráteszem, rétegezem. A lerakáskor azt kell megnézni egyesével minden ellenfélnél-és ez a klassz rész- h a legfelső -legutóbb letett- lapjai száma ugyanannyi-e mint az én épp letett lapszámom, ha azonos, akkor meg kell nézni, h kisebb-e az egyes lapok értéke. Ha kisebb: rabolás!!! :-)))
És itt még 1 csavarka: a rabolás kötelező, DE eldönthetem, h kézbe veszem-e -tényleg elrabolom- vagy az ellenfélre hagyom, h döntsön: vissza veszi a kezébe vagy eldobja a dobópakliba, ez utóbbi esetbe ugyanennyit kell húznia helyette. 1 körben, ha úgy jön ki, akár minden ellenfelem is lerabolhatom.
Játékvége: mint csacsis: ha vkinek elfogy a lap a kezéből: azonnal vége. (vagy ha elfogy a húzópakli és a kártyasor is: akkor is rögtön vége, akár játékos köre közepén is)
Pontok: a magam elé tett lapok 1-1 plusz pont kézben maradt 1-1 mínusz pont (lapérték nem számít)
Húzáshoz még: vagy húzópakli vagy van 6 db nyílt lap -a kártyasor - abból.Pontosabban és/vagy.
Nekem tetszik így a szabály alapján.
Kipróbáltam. Hű, nagyon-nagyon jó. 1 parti gyorsan lemegy, de érdemes több körösen, adott pontig, vagy inkább adott partiszámig játszani (adott partiszám: mindenki ugyanannyiszor legyen kezdő)

A játék ugye: adott számozású lapból magunk elé teszünk le 1-X db-ot. Rá az előzőleg már kijátszottra. Kijátszás után meg kell nézni, h másoknak a legfelső -legutóbb kijátszott hívása- ugyanennyi lapból áll-e, ha igen, akkor h a mienk nagyobb értékű-e, ha igen, akkor: a vagy elvesszük tőle és kezünkbe, ő meg húz helyette ugyanennyit, vagy azt mondjuk, h ő csináljon vele vmit: vagy visszaveszi kézbe, vagy húz helyette ugyanennyi lapot. Ha több embernél is jobbak vagyunk, akkor többtől is ellopjuk a lapokat. (Kötelező, nem választható a rablás!) Ha vkinek elfogy a lapja: végre a partinak. Pont: kézbe maradt minden egyes lap -1 pont, előttünk lévő minden egyes lap +1 pont.

Első partiban a csapat nehezen lendült bele, meg is nyertem, de aztán mivel 50 pontig mentünk, így erős hanyatlásnak indultam, és utolsó lettem. De nagyon jó, gyors, funny, és figyelős, és szuper. Eddig a csacsi volt a kedvenc, de ez legalább olyan jó. A játék során a már kómázók is magukhoz tértek és felpörögtek, izgis volt. 

Update: Sonderkarten kieg is: megdobja a rablásokkal a cuccot, plusz ugye pont a végén, nem kevés. Jó kieg

An ok game of numbers and suits that isn't a trick-taker or climbing game. I usually like these sorts of games. On your turn you play in front of you as many cards with the same number as you want. When you do that, you look at everyone else's most recent sets to see if they have the same number of cards. If they do, and if your set has a higher numerical value, a number of things can happen: you can steal their hand (if that happens they have to draw an equal number of cards from a combination of the display or top-deck) or decline. If you decline, the affected player must either take this set of cards back to their hand or discard the set and draw an equal number of cards. The game ends when someone sheds their hand or there are no cards left to draw. Cards in hand are a negative point each and cards in your tableau are one positive each. Most points win. As I've said, I think it's ok. The scoring seems pretty tight, which could have to do with the disparity of starting hands. There are other light games I would prefer to play.

Rather counterintuitive. Possibility of bashing one player or some players constantly targeting each other, letting an other one clear his hand without even big sets. Only played with 5 though. Which I won, but don't ask me how. Watching it been played with 3, it seems to be quicker, but still quite chaotic. Especially difficult to time when to stop collecting sets, and when to start emptying your hand. You could have started doing this too late and see your masterplan crumbling down. Not that there's much to plan ahead anyway, as you're very down to luck & what others do to you.

A quick card game with a trivially simple rule set, with more to think about than one would expect at first.

Kartenspiele der Kategorie ABLUXXEN gibt es wie Sand am Meer. Wichtiger als bei jedem anderen Spiel lebt das Kartenspiel auch von seiner atmosphärischen Gestaltung. Ganz schlimm finde ich nackte, lieblose Zahlen auf den Karten. In ABLUXXEN hat es immerhin ein Fuchskopf auf die Karte geschafft, um die Zahlen nicht ganz so nackt und karg erscheinen zu lassen. Der arme Schwäbisch Hall Bausparkassenfuchs muss einmal mehr als Schlaukopf (Karten ausspielen) und Dieb (Karten abluxxen) herhalten und für den Mechanismus symbolisch herhalten. Der Fuchs guckt aber zu draufgemalt aus der Karte um dem Zahlenwerk mehr Leben einzuhauchen als die neue Variante des Überbieten und Wegnehmen hergibt.

RATING: 8
For a light card game it is surprisingly interesting. There are some meaningful decisions when you want to snag (abluxxen) the cards of other players and when you want to trick them that they snag your cards.
Although it is difficult to find the right moments when you have to stop collecting cards and should play the cards as fast as possible before someone closes the game.
We played today 4 rounds and although I never was the one who closed the game I had the mist points in 3 of the 4 games and was the obvious winner. So closing the game can be very good - especially if you can surprise another player. But it is not nescessary to win.

This is a simple and fun card game that has a whole lot of interaction and enough tactical space to keep me engaged. The snatching mechanism (i.e., if you play a set of cards of higher value and same amount as another player, you can either take their cards or make them discard them from their point pile), makes the game. Furthermore, the unexpectedly quick ending adds a lot of tension, requires you to balance greed with tempo. Overall, Linko is at once a mean and brilliant shedding game, while still being wholly accessible due to its easy-to-teach/learn structure.

You know a game is good when you play it and think "I can't believe no one thought of this before." Such simple rules -- although most people do tend to need one play before they really grok it.

I've played with folks who think the game is really light and those who think it has hidden depths -- I side with the latter, especially if you do cumulative scoring with each player dealing once. But I haven't played yet with anyone who didn't enjoy it.

A neat fun little game that reminds me of several others but is not quite like any of them. Has Herr Kramer slipped though, where are the advanced variants? (not that it needs it, but he usually includes some, especially for something like this)

Essentially its like a more dynamic (and somewhat dirty, it's from the Master of dirt, after all...) climbing game. So like Gang of Four (or Tichu less the teams) you are trying to get rid of your hand the fastest, BUT there is a big twist here. Any time your cards played are higher in value than someone else's, you can choose to either steal their cards or give them the choice to either: pick the cards back up, or throw them away and draw new ones (from face up cards and/or face down stack). 

One more thing too, their is a push your luck element as well as whoever played the most cards in front of them will score the most points, so incentive to steal, BUT, don't get caught with the cards, all cards in hand at the end are negative! Game ends when someone runs out of cards or the draw pile runs out. 

Very little rules, fast paced, short play time, and fun addictive gameplay give this one a pretty wide appeal. 

I wonder if an interesting variant would have been to have the low cards like 1 and 2 count as 2 points instead of just 1 (maybe not as someone just eventually collects a big enough number of them and would score too many points=dominant strat?) More play and thought needed

Linko! is a solid set collection card game. It actually reminds me of the feel of a trick-taking card game where players have to decide at what points to play stronger cards.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (November 2014)

Fun light climbing game. Easy to teach and quick to play, great filler. It is a good family game but it has some depth. In your turn you have to play a set of cards and perhaps “attack” other players, it has interesting decisions (what to play, how many cards, if I attacked should I take the cards, if attacked which card should I draw) for such a short game.
 
For now, I really like Linko! I will play again soon. One of the best card games I played this semester.

My desire to play Linko! again is rather low, so I’m rating it accordingly.

I finally played Linko! again and I really enjoyed it. The game plays very fast so you can probably play several hands in a row. It is a fun light game.

It saddens me a bit that I decided to sell the game, but I’m trying to get my game collection under control.

Linko! is a great family/filler game and I would play again if requested.

This is a simple, light card game. It's not a trick taker or a ladder climber, but it feels little like one. The strategy is in figuring out how to best play your hand to prevent other players from snatching your cards and setting you back. It felt a little like Hearts or Black Spy, but it's a little but lighter and plays faster.

I grew up on card games.  Canasta, Hearts, Spades, if it used a deck of cards, I played it.  I really wish this one would've been around back then, because it's something special.  I can see this going over well with nearly any group who's at least somewhat interested in card games.  The simplicity really draws me in, and there's a little more going on here than just the regular old "play a card, draw a card".  It's really a great card game that I can see myself playing for years to come.

RATING: 7
Game with climbing-type mechanics, but not really a card climbing game. Cards played are +1 points, cards left in hand are -1 points. If you play a set of equal number of cards of a higher value than a set most recently played by other players, you can make them draw cards. Game ends when a player runs out. Solid, fun, and quick.

104 cartas, en 13 sets de 8 cartas cada uno y ya tienes juego.

Empiezas con unas cuantas cartas en tu mano y tienes que intentar jugarlas todas, individualmente o en sets de cartas del mismo número. El primero que se quede sin cartas en la mano desencadena el final de la partida. Las cartas en la mano cuentan como -1 punto cada una, las cartas en tu tablero cuentan como +1 cada una.

El tema es que el resto de jugadores pueden forzarte a meter cartas nuevas en tu mano jugando el mismo número de cartas pero de valor superior.

Parece un juego bastante simple pero tiene un montón de estrategia.

104 cards, in 13 sets of 8 cards each one and you have a game.

You get a some cards in your hand and you have to try to play all of them individually or in sets of equal numbers. The first player with no cards on his/her hands triggers the end of the game. Cards on your hand count as -1 point each one, cards on your table count as +1 point each one.

The point is that the rest of the players can force you to add more new cards to your hand by playing the same number of cards but with a higher cifer on them.

It looks as a quite simple game but there is a lot of strategy in it.

RATING: 7
The distinguishing feature is the option to steal cards from other players or at least force them to discard them or take them back to their hand. The limits on this feature are intelligently integrated. It's only possible to take sets of cards consisting of the same quantity of cards having a lower number.

Abluxxen is a clever rummy-like card game with an astonishing possibility to target players perceived to be in the lead. There are good hands and bad hands but skill is required to win. I like it but it probably will be difficult to play it more often as card games have a hard time in my game groups anyway and Abluxxen's design is far away from being appealing.

It may take a round or two before the rules click in some people's heads.  Then it may take another few rounds before they figure out how to manipulate their cards towards a win.  Once that happens the strategy becomes quite deep.

Interesting little card game. More strategy than first appears in adapting what you play to what your opponents do, even outside stealing, and in what has previously been played, both to protect you previous plays and as you see which cards will not come up the draw pile. However, limited by its randomness (it is a card game after all) and by its static number of cards throughout the player count, which cuts the game's arc short at higher player counts.

While it's true for any game, it's especially true for card games that you need to play them a few times to know how good they are. And I have played Abluxxen (yes that's the name of this game) three times and I still feel I have only seen the surface. It is an innovative card game played with two standard (52 cards +3 jokers) decks of cards. It is different from anything I know, still it feels like a great classic card game - I want to play it a lot more, I just have to find the people who want to play it with me...

FIRST IMPRESSIONS:

I found this one quite fun although I would recommend playing at least three games/rounds and summing the scores to make up for any potential luck of the draw.  This one is fairly easy to teach/learn/play with most of the decisions being about whether to take the cards you filch or whether you discard them and whether you break up your potential sets to steal opponents' cards.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Very good card game with some of the feel of The Great Dalmuti in its climbing aspects but the "snatching" of cards requires a new set of decision making that gives the game a different tactical feel.  Quite a good entry into the field of simple (but not insipid) abstract card games.

A seemingly simple card game full of tough choices. It's got a unique mechanism in which it's kind of but not really a climbing game? Hard to describe. A single play (at least with three) ends kind of abruptly, but I imagine you'd play about five hands and total your score for a complete game. Quick, fun, and tricky.

There's nothing really bad about Linko but to me there's not that much that separates it from all the other easy to learn hand management games out there either.

A brilliant and different card game.  You have a hand of cards and can play any card or matching cards.  If a player plays a set of cards of the same number as you, he or she has the chance to take your cards, or he can pass on taking the cards, you must take from a  face up tableau of 6 cards at the center of the table.  Or you if your cards were not taken, can pickup your cards again.  Once the draw deck is out or one player is out, the game ends.  For each card in front of you, you get a point, each card in your hand you lose a point, most points wins.

Simple enough to be immediately picked up by a broad audience (children, grand parents, etc.), but requires skill to play well.
It can be played with two decks of standard cards, but the colors and numbers that are used in the original box make it just look better and more important: more accessible.
Yes there is luck with the cards, but you always play more then one round and it is really important to do damage control in the rounds that you can not win.

My wife also likes it very much even though when playing together I win most of the times. One of our most played games.

RATING: 7.5
This is another pretty interesting filler game that requires some good decisions to be made...

You play sets of the same number cards from your hand and place them in front of you and at the end of the game each card in front of you it's 1 point...
The second set of cards that a player plays goes on top of the previous one making it "secure"...

The cards aren't secure because if I put a "1" in front of me if anyone plays a card higher than the "1" can take it to their hand (to make bigger sets) or if they don't want it I'll have to either take it to my hand again or discard it and pick up a card from the 6 cards on display on the card row or the one on top of the deck that's face down.

In the same example of the "1" I played if every one else plays a pair, a 3 of a kind, etc, my "1" will be safe.. we only lose the cards in front of us if another player plays the same number of cards we have currently on top and of a higher number... if it's the same number or lower nothing happens.

The game ends when a player gets rid of all the cards in their hand or the deck of cards and the "reserve" row is emptied

Each card in front of a player on the table is worth 1 point and each card in hand is worth -1

Very interesting game indeed

I know some people say that this is one of the best fillers out there, but I just don't get it. This feels a bit like Rummy, except that you're constantly having to interrupt the flow of the game so that snatching cards can happen. It just feels like a game full of hiccups, and one that is very unfriendly to new players, as getting points is difficult to do without experienced play. I don't know...this one just wasn't for me.

It's a simple set collection abstract card game that reminds a bit the mechanic of some popular Spanish card games, but they've developed it in a way that makes it so much more thrilling. Simple rules, plays fast, real decisions (not simple luck of the draw)... It's one of those games where one play is not enough.

[b]Linko[/b] was sold via auction 6/15/15.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]I ended up getting a copy thinking I would play this a lot with my son and dad. We ended up playing 3 games one night and didn't think the 3p game was nearly as good as playing with 5, especially compared to playing Parade with 3. Around the same time I got Linko I also picked up Diamonds and Stichling which have both become hits in our house. Diamonds has become a huge hit with my son and dad and my daughter really likes Stichling. That left Linko as the odd man out so I ended up trading my copy during a game purge I admit I was probably a bit hasty. 

Since I didn't give this game a fair shake I've put it back on my wishlist. My son did enjoy it and now I think my daughter may as well. I did end up getting it again and my original thoughts still stand. I think you need at least 5 players or I'd rather play other card games. Since I hardly play with that count it's leaving for good.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]This was another fun trick taker Mat introduced me to. Currently I am comparing Linko to [thing=56692][/thing] which has been getting a lot of play with my dad and son. Linko doesn't surpass Parade for me so I am not sure that I would add it to my collection [i](Especially since [thing=152162][/thing] has hit that sweet spot for me)[/i]. However I would play it anytime, I really enjoy trick taking card games and this is a good one.[/i]

Great cardgame, indeed the best cardgame I got to play in a long time. Wonderfull filler. Love this game design by Wolfgang Kramer.
A very nice cardcollection game with a rather high interactive factor which makes it special. I like it a lot. This may well be a new classic by Kramer and Kiesling! I am really looking foreward on playing this again.
Has some elements of Rummy, and some nasty cardstealing moments. Delicious fun.

RATING: 7
One of those games that end before you expect so think short term. You play cards in sets onto the table, which are each worth a point, however if someone else plays a similar set of greater value your cards are removed from your point pile and you draw more cards. Since cards in your hand are bad you want to trade cards to make stronger sets while forcing others to draw often. Surprisingly enjoyable and has a one or two game learning curve.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A sort of a mesh up of rummy mechanics and climbing mechanics with stealing, or "snatching", thrown in.  It takes a hand or two to get the flow down, but once you do you realize the game offers opportunity for measured risk taking and bluffing.  If this one reaches the audiences that it should, it could rival the popularity of games like Tichu.  Good stuff.

This is a simple card game in which players start with a hand of 13 numbered cards, and are trying to get rid of their cards while amassing cards in their score pile.  Players can play any number of cards of the same value to their score pile during their turn.  However, if another player plays cards of the same quantity but higher value than your most recent play, you lose those cards from your score pile, and you have to draw new cards to your hand.  It's a clever system, and as a light card game it works.  However, the quality of a player's starting hand (fewer different numbers is good) may be the ultimate factor in deciding the winner.

Linko seemed to be the darling card game of Essen and BGG.con 2014, so I was happy to grad an inexpensive copy when the chance presented itself. We played with the full complement of 5 players, and the game didn’t really gel for any of us. The object is to play sets of cards down in front of you. Doing so might allow a player to steal cards from in front of another player, or force him to return a set to his hand. This leads to the game mostly (I think) being about hand management and setting up to go out quickly in the last few turns. However, a player is penalized for cards remaining in her hand when the game ends, so she cannot sit on cards for too long without risking a big penalty. 

I think the game is solid for a quick, light experience. The group however, roundly hated it. I’d like to try it again with fewer players and see if that offers a bit more control.

I got to play this at my local meetup. It is a game that was on my radar for a while because some people thought it will win the SDJ of 2014 on the geek. I was glad that I gave it a try.

The rule is simple and the strategy is not apparent on the first play so it feels like a gamer's filler card game. It is both a set collection and climbing game and I think the mix is an interesting one. Too bad my fiancée doesn't like games that's too similar to traditional card games.

It plays fast and the group enjoyed it so much we had a second play right afterwards. The idea is you want to empty your hand first. You do this by playing a set of matching cards to your score pile. Other players can attack the top sets on the score piles by playing the same number of cards in a higher value set. At the end you get 1 point for each card in your score pile minus one for each remaining card in your hand. In both games, the winner was the one who managed to end the game first, regardless of how much was in his pile. Not taking negatives was huge for them. I'm very happy to have this in the warm-up game pile.

The deck is just 8 each of values 1-13 (no suits) and 5 jokers. The idea is to play sets of the same number in front of you and to get rid of cards in hand, since your final score is one minus the other. But when you play a 'better' set than the last set another player has in front of them (the same number of cards but a higher value) you can 'snatch' those cards to your hand (to form bigger sets to play later) or force them to take the cards back into hand (or alternatively discard them and replace from a face-up pool). Seems like the first half of the game is about accumulating sets in your hand so you can get lots of cards played, and then switching at the right moment to playing them out so you don't get stuck with them when someone else goes out! I was impressed that K&K managed to make a card game out of such simple elements that feels so fresh.

My copy arrived from Germany yesterday and played it three times, once with the original rules and twice with the two player duel rules.

RATING: N/A
Very simple card game that makes you think "why didn't I come up with this?" It's a little wonky to try and explain, but you make sets of cards and can play whatever you want on your turn, sometimes choosing to "snatch" the cards of someone who earlier played the same number of cards as you but of lower values. It's a really simple design where you try and work the balance of "cards in hand" with "cards on the table," because your score is the difference between the two. 

I have the German version, called Abluxxen, which is a way better name than Linko.

Abluxxen is a simple but involving card game which just fails to fit in the ideal filler spot. Players take it in turns to play sets of one or more cards. The last set they played is vulnerable and if an opponent plays a higher value set of the same size (for example 'three 7s' is vulnerable to 'three 9s') they can steal or force the player to either discard the set or return it to their hand. Cards on the table score you points, those in your hands lose you points.
Simple, but not unfortunately intuitive. Several players struggled even after a few hands, one player just could not understand at all. And almost everyone played slow, dragging the game beyond that 5-10 minute rapid fire play that really makes games like Love Letter and Non Merci. Which is a pity because I could see quite a bit of depth to the decisions that were involved.
This might be one I'll revise up or down if I get to try it with players more familiar with the game.

15-02-2015. Rated after several plays. Linko or Abbluxxen is an abstract cardgame in which you play sets of cards of  numbers 1 to 13, with several wilds. All cards are distributed equally in the game. The aim is to quickly empty your hand.

Each turn you try to play a set of cards. If that set is the same number as one of your opponents set of cards but of a higher numerical value, you can take the set into your hand and they have to draw an equal amount from the deck. If you are not interested, they have to take  return it to their hand. If they do not want the cards, they can discard them to draw from the draw pile.

The game is fun, but I think I may prefer trick taking over this game if I ever get 3+.

This is a basically a traditional card game.  Not sure why you would actually buy this game - you just need 2 playing card decks (8 cards each - 1-13, plus jokers for wilds).  And it's a pretty bad card game at that.  Play a trick-taking or ladder game - they're much better.

Clever. I appreciate it more so with repeated plays. Not always obvious which card you should play (observing what players pick up will help a bit), but light enough to be an abstract family game - my seven year old is seriously good at it.

A round is over in 5-10 minutes and the simple scoring makes players think about whether it's in their interest to go out or not. You'll be observing what your opponents are picking up and either tempting them into making you pick up your cards, or playing a set where you hope they can't. Best of all is that a player in the lead can be picked on and still end up scoring well in a round because of good play.

A lot of the game lies in the timing. You'll be wanting to tempt players to trump you when there are good cards available to pick up, and looking to trump players who have a card value you're wanting to build up. It gives the game a nice feel, with some satisfying moves, tension to see if you'll be trumped or not and there's always something of interest to keep your mind occupied. At the same time it's not too taxing not he brain and you can chat and socialise during play.

Good, quick and a bit different to other games. I'd prefer a better abstract theme - the lynx suit the name wordplay, but I find them a bit dull - it doesn't seem to bother other gamers I play with though.

RATING: 7.5
Played once with 3P. A rather charming yet vicious card game in which players play sets of cards from their hands in order to be the first to exhaust their hand. However, whenever a higher-valued set is played, players with lower-valued sets either take their set back to hand or give it to to the player who played the higher-valued set.

There is a bit more going on in this game than it initially seems. Sometimes weak sets should be played early so you can 'take a hit' and turn the set into something stronger for yourself. There is also a memory element involved as players need to remember what cards are going into their opponents' hands.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Clever, tense, sorta trick-taking game where players play single or sets of cards in similar numbers (from a pool of 8 suits of 1 to 13 plus 5 wild cards) each turn. Players who player a higher powered similar set or single can steal lower sets or make players either discard or take back their lower numbered cards.

The object is to rid yourself of all cards. Each card played successfully scores a point. With each card in hand counting as -1 point.

Very very clever use of cards. There are elements of pushing your luck, card counting, and tactical decisions. Alot of game in a small box.

I have thoughts about variants where players are also allowed to play straights in addition to sets...will that work?

Really a fun, different card game. You play some low combinations of cards in hopes that they'll get picked up and you can trade out for higher value cards. I like how near the end, there's tension with racing to see who is going out first.

RATING: 9
Nice, innovative game that does something quite fresh with a simple deck of 8 colors, 13 ranks, and 5 jokers.  There is a definite luck factor, but a skilled player can make the best out of a bad draw.  Dead simple to learn, loads of fun to play.  It's a winner.

The 2P variant is even better than the multi player, imo. 

EDIT: UGH!  They just changed the BGG name of this game from Abluxxen to Linko :-( What were the publishers thinking?  Abluxxen is a much more fun name.  Glad I own the German version.

EDIT:  I like all player counts a lot!

Quick little card game that's been getting a lot of buzz here. Fun, I suppose, but I don't see what all the fuss is about! But I wouldn't mind playing it again -- it seems like a nice filler.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
The cards (1-13 x 8, 5 jokers) are shuffled and dealt 13 cards. Place several cards face up. On your turn, play a set of cards of same number. If you beat another player's set (same number of cards), may either:
- take those; that player draws replacements from display and/or deck
OR
- not take them; that other player either returns them to hand, or discards them and draw as many from display and/or deck
Refill display. 

The game ends immediately when a player's hand is empty, or when deck runs out. Players score +1 VP per card in front of them, -1 VP per card in hand. Most VP wins!

My collection of these small, quick card games has been steadily growing.  They don't take up a lot of space, they typically play large numbers of players, and the tiered arrival of my board game group makes it necessary to have a lot of 15-20 minute filler options.

I preface my comments by saying all that because typically these smaller, lighter games aren't my thing.  I like meaty, heavy games that challenge me and give me a lasting and rich experience.  I am never going to get that from a game like this but nevertheless it was enjoyable and provided enough cerebral activity to keep me engaged.

This game is played with each player taking turns playing some number of cards of the same number in front of them (1-13).  These cards go on top of any previous plays in front of that player and any player who on top of their play area has the same number of cards with a lower value has their cards "snatched".  "Snatched" can mean taken by the active player or the active player can force that player to choose to discard or take those cards back into their hand.  This continues until a player runs out of cards in their hand and the player with the most cards in front of them (minus whatever is left in their hand) wins.

Super simple and reasonably easy to teach but with a nice tree of decisions and a lot of strategy.  These kinds of games might not be my favorite but this is certainly a good one.

[Ravensburger 2016 edition] {Animal; shedding; optimal 4-5p} Abluxxen is a very good filller.  Player interaction is good, not really luck driven.  My friends like this game too.

It is easy to teach the rules and setup.  It only needs a few turn before players can master the tactic to go out by collecting proper cards so that they can get better score.

I wish the illustration will be funnier.  I generally prefer card games with different illustration each suit or number.  Here ... we just have the same cat face on each card.  It’s dumb!   And, it’s even more dumb with a “X” as a power card!

I like my edition.  It’s smaller, but the problem is I can’t put back the cards after I have put on card sleeves...

Trivially simple to explain (put any number of equal-value cards down in front of you, game ends when a player has no cards left, score = cards in front of you - cards in hand).

Explaining the impact on other players that your card-play causes isn't too hard.

Figuring out how to win the game is something else again.

Quick card game with easy rules and good strategic depth. Due to the comparison mechanic it is quite interactive as you have to pay attention as what's already on the table. Furthermore, it requires no reading which is a huge plus to play it with kids.

Yet another colored-numbered-cards game. But some of those really work great. Like [thing=432][/thing] for instance. It's so simple, yet it's such a great game. This game, from the same designer, with his good buddy [person=42][/person] could turn out to be just as great. Just 2 plays in, it's to early to say how good this game is, but it certainly was more fun than I expected. Looking forward to playing this a lot more.

Abluxxen is a perfectly charming filler which, whilst fun, was not quite the life changing game I'd been hearing. It's a perfect family card game with a little clever hand management.

Megvolt végre az Abluxxen-élmény. 

Tényleg érdekes kis fifikás játék. Nagyon egyszerűek a szabályai, mégis nagyon oda kell figyelni, hogy mikor mit csinálsz. Nagyon kell figyelni az időzítésre: a játék elején lehet dúsítani a lapokat, a pakli fogytával viszont gyorsan kell váltani.

Tényleg meglepő, hogy milyen taktikai mélységek vannak benne. A szabály alapján nem gondolná az ember, hogy ilyen izgalmas a játék.

Györgyinek nem tetszett az absztraktság miatt, de a két személyes partinkban valahogy nem is jött ki a játék szépsége. A többszemélyes partim sokkal jobb volt.

Csak egy hibája van, mégpedig hogy két pakli francia kártyával is tükéletesen játszható. A játékot tehát tulajdonképpen felesleges megvenni, csak a szabályt kell megszerezni.

Lovely double deck card game that shows there is still room for innovation in the realm of traditional card games. Yes, you should purchase the custom deck, but you should also realize this is a clever disguise. What the game offers is something that feels like a mash-up of a rummy and a climbing game, with an interesting decision point about when and how to meld for maximum effect. Really looking forward to repeat plays.

RATING: 8
Still a little uncertain about this, but I like the idea of it so far. It has the feel of a trick-taking game because your're playing sets of cards and hoping that nobody has a higher value of the same set. You're trying to get rid of all of your cards first, while making opponents draw new cards or take cards back into their hand.

Update: One of the best games of the year! I had a rule wrong previously which greatly impacted the game. Just a great game and feels really original for a card game. My only complaint is that sometimes you can get a really bad hand of cards, but it tends to even out by playing a number of rounds equal to the number of players. Great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This game is insidious. Every time I've played it, it's gotten better and better.

It starts with just understanding the consequences of card play. Then, you begin to anticipate and bait your opponents into taking cards, all the while playing large sets and crossing your fingers that no one Abluxxes it. Then, after you understand the basic strategy of the game, you start card-counting and remembering cards that your opponents are taking.

One play is not enough. Neither is two plays. And you gotta like it enough to get that far. But, man does this game run deeper than I ever expected it to.

I wanted to get this game for a while, but couldn't find anyone on this continent that had it for sale. I was getting desperate; our annual family vacation was looming, and I really wanted to have it by then. A week before departure, I found it at TimeWellSpent, FOR ONLY $22.95! So I bit the bullet and ordered it. 
Turned out to be a good call. No game I have EVER brought here has been so popular. It got played multiple times every day. Interesting combinations of game mechanics, multiple ways to score, a fair amount of screwage (but not too much), all players constantly engaged, all the while being easily taught and played. Not sure how deep it is, or how exactly to play well (I finished last in both my games), but no matter, I've already got my money's worth.

Linko is a simple filler game. There are cards numbered 1 - 13 with 8 of each denomination. There's six cards face up in the center of the table and a blind deck, both of which you can draw from when you need to take cards.

On your turn, you play a single card or a set of the same number to your tableau. The set you play covers any existing sets you've previously played, protecting them. If your set has the same number of cards as any other player's top set, you choose whether you want to take those cards from their tableau into your hand. If yes, they draw replacements and it's done.

If not, they decide if they want to take the set back into their hand, or discard it and draw replacements. You keep playing sets until someone goes out. At that point every card in your tableau is a point and every card in hand is a point against you.

It's quick and there's some strategy. But there's nothing terribly exciting here. It's fine enough, but there are plenty of fillers I'd like to play as much or more than this.

Quite a fun little card game that is easy to play and teach to non-gamers, but has enough strategy and tension for gamers to enjoy as well.

Really clever twist on ladder-climbing, in which you can take cards into your hand (snatched from your opponent or taken from a common pool) in order to shed more powerful sets later on.

Abluxxen has retired Haggis for me. The extra level of planning and interaction is fun to try and grok, yet it's somehow easier to teach and takes a wider player count. The 2 player variant works well too. 

Avoid if you need theme. Buy if you want a tight addictive filler.

Entertaining cardgame that is easy to explain and fast to play. I like how you can set yourself up to be "attacked", so you can get to the cards lying on the table. Or how you can attack others to either delay them or to build up for a difficult to defeat set of cards. This makes for very interesting cardplay.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A really quick and fun card game filler with some depth. While there are some shades of Trick taking, this is not really a trick taking game at all. Rather, players snatch sets of cards from each other as they attempt to score points by playing card in their own personal stack while trying to end the game by exhausting the cards at hand. The depth here comes from the way set collection is managed, the timing of when cards are snatched and also paying close attention to the numerical advantage of sets played to prevent snatching from opponents.
A pleasant yet unexpected design from the dynamic duo of Kramer and Kiesling since they usually do mid-level Euros. 

092214: A bunch of plays later, the game is still good, but no longer stellar. It does get a bit stale over time and one can generally get a feel on how to play well given a hand of cards. Keeping high cards for an end game push remains important. A five player game affords less control over the cards played and what gets abluxxed, and hence, more chaos and less desirable. A change of rating from 9 to 7.

Unique twist on a set collection card game. Deck of colored fox cards with values. Play a set of a kind and it can cause another player to lose their most recent played set. This is "abluxxen".  The strategy is to try to get abluxxed (snatched from) to get compensation from the public display to build big sets. The rules even include a snatch flowchart.  Pretty basic but it is a new concept that takes a couple plays to get the hang of.

Luck of the draw affecting the initial hand seems to play a big role. The main tactic is to get rid of your small cards early, or trick others into allowing you to form a longer set of small numbers, then leave the larger numbers to last. Nice artwork though.

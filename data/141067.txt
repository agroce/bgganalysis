A fresh take on the sport of baseball that includes even umpire ratings.

RATING: 9
Another great game from plaay.com.  They really have it dialed in when it comes to creating unique ways to bring fun and realism to a sport.  The decider die is the trick here as outcomes are sometimes determined on a 50/50 basis.  It means a lot of drama while still giving you the essence of a baseball game. Some may think it's too simplistic, but it's not.

Completely fires on all cylinders for me. I've been looking for a game I can relax with like this for a long, long time. The designer is a gent and in my opinion he has made an absolutely excellent game here.

One of the best baseball games I have ever played.  Ingenious design and implementation, smooth game play, accessible right out of the box.  All the things that a great *game* has ...

RATING: 8
One of the most interesting things I have found over the years is how game designers visualize/conceptualize how a game will look and play like on the table top.  Being mostly a baseball fan the many unique ways the great American pastime has been converted to cards and dice is outstanding.  With the introduction of History Maker Baseball last year the designer looked outside the box from the normal genre of other baseball simulation games by introducing such things as personal and team moods and the influence of things like the media.  Perhaps because of this external aspect part of the game I found it hard to embrace the game as I did with other baseball game simulations.  Given time to think about that, that is perhaps why there is a lure and confidence factor of playing the various games that are marketed by Plaay.  The game's uniqueness while subscribing to the pecking order of a games events (pitcher abilities that could be trumped by certain attributes of a hitter or even a fielder involvement) is all there with each at bat that sort of one on one confrontation that is prevalent in Plaay games (I have played Second Season since its inception and I'm now hooked on Soccer Blast as well).  With History Maker Baseball your baseball field of dreams that are contained inside the handsome box the game comes with is an open book filled with a lot of twists and turns based on game events and pre-game conditions.  For sheer fun factor this game is well worth purchasing.  Highly recommended.

RATING: 7.5
This game does an excellent job of capturing the feel of baseball.  It is fun (if not a bit long, but only a bit) to play but the weakness is that the runs scored are just too high.  The pluses are certainly there.  Especially the ability to rate your own teams, etc.

The run issue is definitely detracting from it.

I have been playing sports board games since the 1970s and have played more than 30 different games. History Maker Baseball is the best sports simulation tabletop game on the market. Does an amazing job of giving you both a statically accurate simulation and the feel of a real game. The use of words instead of numbers gives the game a more at the ballpark or listening to a game on the radio feel. I find myself actually speaking out loud and announcing the game as I roll the dice. If you enjoy baseball and tabletop games, this is a no-brainer. Base set comes with 4 teams, with 2 of them being the 1975 World Series matchup between the Boston Red Sox and the Cincinnati Reds. This season and series got me hooked on baseball and it is great to be able to bring back the amazing feelings from that summer and fall.

I quite enjoyed this game. It is my first baseball sim game, and I think it has a lot of promise. There is an expansion that lets you make cards for a team from regular baseball cards, though you can easily use info from the internet to make them. I am planning on trying it, and will increase my rating if it works well.

RATING: 7
I can respect that some folks find pure stats too dry, and thus gravitate towards narrative descriptions like "Sad Sack" and "Whiffer" but for me these cutesy equivalents get in the way of enjoying the game.  I would rather just get the stats straight instead of converting them to catchy names.  Plus I've never really cottoned to the chart-checking where somehow if the batter is X, then that means the result is Y.  Like: "Champion? Bloop single to LF!"  Umm... okay.

Includes: Famous Fall Classics. Individual cards for over 400 real-life big-league baseball players based on eight different fall classic series: 1947, 1954, 1965, 1968, 1971, 1972, 1985 and 1986.

RATING: 6
Streamlined baseball sim that does a good job of losing numbers, and instead goes with traits for each player.  One neat aspect is the pre-game where you find out the mood of each team, who's hot and who's cold, etc. The only downer to me is that I sort of miss the details that were stripped out – I like to know what the ERA is for my pitcher and the batting average for my hitter, especially if it's for a historic team. Having said that, I've only just scratched the surface of this game, so time will tell!

Great solo baseball game. It's a lot of fun as a two player game but the experienced player will have the upper hand on the novice. I've played it almost exclusively solo and really enjoyed it. I play it with the "Famous Fall Classics" set of cards. I'm always the '86 Mets. Great game.

RATING: 9
Excellent simulation of baseball. There are many baseball games out there (some great ones!) which excel at reproducing stats, but HMB offers a unique take. You will feel the urge to pull a rookie in a big moment situation or the front office might not be so happy with the job you are doing in the dugout. If you love the emotional ebb and flow of a MLB season get this game. Players will perform close to real life but it's just as much about the story/journey.

Solitaire possible.

The game came with 2 sample teams (and umpires and park cards) from the 1975 championship 
• (1975 Boston Red Sox (AL) and Cincinnati Reds (NL).

Also, I got the 
•How-To Guide for creating your own player cards.  

I also purchased the following sets:
• Century League fictional card set,
• Famous Fall Classics set (1947, 1954, 1965, 1968, 1971, 1972, 1985, 1986 championship teams, umpires and ballpark cards), 
• The 125 card Hall of Fame set, and the 
• 2014 All-Star Game set that came with the Decider Die Kickstarter campaign


• I also printed out many of the free downloads from the Plaay.com website, including:
1882 American Association 
1888 National League (+ AA's St. Louis team)
1933 Negro League
1944 Women's AAGPBL
1953 Women's AAGPBL
1979 World Series teams (Pittsburgh Pirates and Baltimore Orioles)
2016 World Series teams (Chicago Cubs and Cleveland Indians)

This is the baseball game that I'd always wanted to design myself, and now I don't have to! Simplifies and abstracts many of the mechanics that bogs down more traditional tabletop baseball games, while injecting "fun" and delivering believable results.

RATING: 9.5
I was ready to dislike this game after getting it due to the weak soft box and only getting two teams, but I gave it a fair opportunity. I was pleased that I did so once I got past being  underwhelmed by being only sent 2 teams - really? But I get what they are doing. Their game vision is different - like the Euro treatment of Stalingrad that works, HMB attacks baseball from a different perspective. You're not going to compete with Strat-O-Matic, APBA, or Pursue the Pennant on their turf (I didn't include Replay's game as I haven't been able to ever contact anyone there or Payoff Pitch).  It's when you get to understand the totality of their game that it becomes obvious just how MUCH is here , disguised as someone's effort to make a baseball game, when it is anything but an effort! How much do I like it? I've rolled 81 games of the 1969 O's season, and plan on the purchase of past seasons (I'm excited with the release of 1962 upcoming!).  It's an unqualified winner in my book. Be aware though - it's a bit addictive. And FUN.

Very interesting, unique approach to a baseball board game. Players and teams can run hot or cold, players use attributes rather that stats. Very well done.

I really feel like I chose well when deciding which would be the game to use for a  replay of the the Boston Red Sox 1980 season.

It plays fast, solo's wonderfully and is so much more than just cold stats and chart referencing. It brings you into the clubhouse. Gives you a sense of the players moods, the umpire tendencies, the ballparks themselves. When I play this it's more than just dice-rolls, the players come alive and when all is said and done, that's what I wanted more than anything.

Follow along with my 1980 play-through if you'd like:

6-16 very good game that works well. Have self rated the 16 original franchise 1920-1930 all-stars and played several games. Out of the box the player cards are sort of lame but what makes this game shine is the playbook(engine). 

Rating could go up with more play and this might be the best tt bb game, but I have yet to play "Payoff Pitch" so my crowning is being held off.

The genius behind Keith Avallone's modern tabletop sports designs is that they make no bones about pulling you straight into the narrative of the sport. He has carefully crafted all the systems to encourage you to see the event in your mind's eye, and to push the raw numbers into the background, and he does this while still swearing fealty to those numbers behind the scenes (you get realistic stats).

If you care about statistical minutiae, get Strat-O-Matic. Get this game if you care about any of the following (1) playing with fictional players, (2) customer support or (3) simulating the clubhouse over the course of a season.

RATING: 8
This is another game that has an inventive platform, somewhat unique to the genre.  Instead of basing the player ratings on statistical, and observed strengths and weaknesses, individual players are rated more generically, into subsets having to do with the normal abilities of ballplayers.  In addition to this, a form of psychological rating is applied, as well as ratings for umpires, which are also interesting in that the ratings attempt to capture the tendencies of select men in blue, and how they are different from each other.
The main weakness of the game is tied into the platform, as with generic ratings, you tend to get generic profiles of each player.  Historically, that doesn't suit my tastes, but for a fictional set of players, which really is the game's strong suit, it is indeed magnificent.  It is due to this fictional option that I rate it so high.

Interesting 2 player area-control game, with a unique action-selection mechanism involving a miniature "jigsaw" like arrangement of action tiles. Good artwork and nice components make this a quality package. Plays in under an hour, and provides lots of interesting choices. Good stuff.

RATING: N/A
Easy rules, many combinations. I like the way first player each round is found - chosen by the player who got less points.

Though, winning my first 2 games (big point gap) with someone who know that game lot earlier doesnt make me feel like trying it again soon.

Got sucked in by the "programming" promise. But its really just a simple action selection mechanism. Its ok, it looks nice, but in the end there are better two-player games.

An awesome , underestimated 2 player game. I must say I really enjoy it everytime I play. It does not take long but there is plenty of options and interaction between players. "Shall I go first or shall I let him(her) do his part and ruin his plans late ... " Can't wait to play again

Area control with just two players is an odd combination but it does work out fine here. The action selection mechanism is pretty neat but it does get a little repetitive towards the end.

Great 2 player game! That's exactly how I want a small 2 player game to be. It's easy to learn, while there's a good amount of strategy and interaction in this game.

Only negative I found are the "instant" cards that come into play after the 6th round, as those are wortless most of the time. Since money = points, they cost way to much for their effects.

Feels sort of like an abstract wargame. I found the non-core turn phases (market, turn setup) disconnected, maybe because of the lack of theme. I did like the core of the game (the back and forth activations), and I feel like there's a great game lurking underneath that uses the main mechanic.

Didn't click with me at all. Feels unnecessary gimicky what with the programming phase and what not. Also didn't really feel in control too much. That might change with repeated play, but if it doesn't manage to make me want to play another time, might as well not bother. Bummer!

Great 2-Player-Game with nice twists. Its very important to check out the programming of your opponent and then decide, wether to start or let him go first. Very beautiful artwork and very well written rules, needs some more (planetary) cards though.

New to me in 2017 due to Galakta releasing some of their games in the US. A 2 player area control game that is pretty abstract and themeless. Iconography is quite irritating and I'm hoping I enjoy this game more as I play it.

RATING: 9
Advantages:
Beautiful design and artwork
Easy to learn

Disadvantages:
Only 2 players
Usualy it's about harm you opponent, not about minding your own business 
Rulebook clunky

Ganz gutes 2-Personen Spiel
Die Spieler wählen (puzzlen) gleichzeitig bis zu 4 Aktionen, die sie in der Runde durchführen. Je mächtiger die Aktion, desto höher ihr Wert und die jeweils mächtigste Aktion hat nur einen Anschlusspunkt, an die nur eine weitere Aktion gepuzzelt werden kann, somit verfallen weitere Aktionen.
Beide Spieler decken gleichzeitig ihre Wahl auf und derjenige mit dem geringeren Wert wählt, wer beginnen darf.
Es gibt die Aktionen das Raumschiff weiter zu bewegen, Bergbauroboter am Standort positionieren, Karten aus der Auslage zu kaufen, etc. zusätzlich darf man noch die Aktion des Standorts nutzen, was ebenfalls recht mächtig ist. Haben beide Spieler ihre Aktionen ausgeführt, erhalten sie Siegpunkte, je nach Mehrheiten auf den einzelnen POlaneten (Roboter).
Nach 9 Runden ist Schluss und der reichere Spieler gewinnt.
Mir hat das Spiel recht gut gefallen. Ein Spiel bei dem es wieder darum geht was denkt mein Gegner was ich denke was er denkt.... solche Spiele gefallen mir ja schon. Auch die Aktionswahl ist dadurch manchmal beeinflussend. Die Wahl, wer Startspieler sein wird fällt meisstens auf den Anderen, da es sehr mächtig ist nachzuziehen und die Mehrheit zu schaffen, ohne dass der andere reinpfuschen kann.

A really cool, tightly structured space-themed game with a compelling backstory. The pre-programming your turn aspect is a great little mechanism. I'm chagrined at how long it's taking to get it back to the table. [1 play]

Really neat 2 player game.  From Joel Eddy's collection (Drive Thru Review) with signed box lid.  As he said "Like Eve Online, but Engaging"

RATING: 7.25

 The core mechanics are abstract, but there's some theme into it. It's basically an area control programming game. It's mostly a tactic game with some random factors (the cards and the actions of your rival). The art and components are nice.

It is a very sound game that works quite well. You have meaty decisions each round with very important effects. Interaction is key in this game. You will get the best results by second-guessing your rival.

AP is a danger present in this game and the gameflow is not fast. I suspect it has a [not very steep] learning curve, especially with the cards. It can also have an important snowball effect.

Essen '13.

Missing the plastic pieces (fasteners for the scoring thingies, and stands for the spaceships). Emailed Galakta and received the missing bits a few days later - excellent service, thanks!

Played at the fair, seemed like a fun 2p game, even though we made some mistakes. 

We played again, corrected our mistakes from last time, but made some new ones. There's even more to this than I first thought, very nice, really want to get this correct ruleswise next time.

A good game, especially considering the price. It's entirely plausible that you would find a game of this kind going for twice the money. 

The game is very neatly done. Nice graphics, good components, small box that fits this all in. I would prefer to have different card backs for action modules (and themselves not being called modules, as it's even more confusing, they're not modules at all) - the color change only is not helpful. Also the player covers could take a hint from CGE games and put some useful hints/summaries/information inside. But, it's a budget game and I understand that somethings were cut down to get to desired price range. Still, these things could be improved.

I like hybrid games. This is obviously an euro-optimalization game, but what I really like is that the optimalization isn't done in a vacuum, but in response to other player's actions. There's a huge deal of interaction here and this is what makes the game interesting and vastly superior over any typical euro game of optimalizing resources in a myriad of point salads. That interactions allows for second guessing and bluffing, which adds a nice component to the game. 

There's enough stuff for player to have control over. Programs, cards, planet actions. This is, again, very nice, comparing to typical euro, where your options are most often arbitrary and given by the board/rules. Here, you have a fair amount of space for your own decisions and planning ahead. It feels like you have something to say, as opposed to the game playing you. The programming component also adds this small "puzzle" to the game, which is always a plus. That said, everything in the game is oriented around "pushing cubes" (literally!). In this regard, planet actions feel somewhat "cheap" mechanically, as they're most often variations on "remove cube, add cube".

I also like modular games. Here, the whole game is compressed to 7 small planet boards that you arrange in different setups. Each setup will influence your game plan and you cannot be prepared for everything. The game isn't *very deep*, though. I would imagine, that after 10-20 plays, some prevailing strategies will emerge, no matter what. 

It's a game that's doing many things right and don't promise an epic fight that will last ages and burn your brain. The rules are relatively easy and well written and the game is also easy to teach.

A well-done abstract area majority game for 2 players.  The space-exploration-and-mining theme is largely unnecessary, but still works quite well.  The advance programming (in secret) of your Factory Ship is a nice mechanic, and you can never do everything that you want to!  Nicely produced components, great artwork, and lots of choices, decisions and tradeoffs wrapped up in a small game with (relatively) simple gameplay mechanics.  Can take a while to play when starting out, or if one or more players have AP tendencies.  Recommended nevertheless.

Two player sci-fi space area control on a central row of seven random planets.  Arrange legal sub-program tile combos of varying difficulty behind player screens. Simplest combos play first to move and deploy extractor cubes on the planets to harvest Metallum. Some bluff and counter on when to arrange your programmed action tiles.

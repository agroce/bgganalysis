Another attempt to interest my son in physical board/card gaming, again with little effect.
We both loved the Card Wars episode of Adventure Time and so the release of this seemed a no-brainer buy. Unfortunately supply problems (at least here in Australia) inserted a waiting period which allowed levels of excitement to cool and the App version to be discovered and keep my son in the exclusive clutches of the virtual world. :-)
I'm no online/video-hating luddite but I would prefer his experiences to be more varied.

iOS & standard

This is a light card game that has an interesting twist that it is lane based. You can only attack in your lane, which is a fun take on this type of system. The game is not too creative. I bought all three (at the time) packs. I wish each deck were a little more thematic to the characters. Also, the decks in each pack compliment each other very well, but if you play characters from different decks it is unbalanced.

(I log all of my AT:CW plays under this entry as it was the original set)

AT:CW is not the most sophisticated CCG that you're ever going to play, but it is an amusing diversion that is much more enjoyable if you're a fan of the show (which I most definitely am!).

The basic gist: you have a deck of no less than 40 cards and 4 landscape tiles (there being 5 landscape types). Players orient their 4 landscape tiles opposing each other, forming 4 fighting lanes that the creatures will be placed into. On your turn you draw a card and get 2 action points to spend. You then fight, and then your turn is over. The creatures you put out go onto specific tiles and only 1 creature can be on each one. They have offence / defence stats like Magic, but unlike Magic the damage they deal is left on them in the form of chits. If a creature attacks and has no adversary it instead hits the player and the goal is to knock down the 25 life points that they start with.

In somewhat more detail, the game is similar to Magic in some regards, but very different in others. You do have to have landscapes that match the cards that you're playing, but you don't actually tap them (or "floop them" in this games parlance), you just check to see if you have enough. Some cards only require 1 of a given landscape, others 2. Landscapes can be flipped over by special effects, so you can't just get away completely scot-free for playing a deck with 2 each of 2 different landscapes, but multi-colour decks aren't penalized as severely here as they are in Magic.

Like Magic there are spells, but they can only be played on your own turn. There are also static abilities in the form of buildings that help out the creatures that are in their lane. 

In general, I would say this has some similarities to Magic, but not as many as it might appear based on the landscape tiles. Combat here is simplified by necessity by the lane-based system and the max 1 creature per lane restriction. The game is, thankfully, hastened along vis a vis Magic for newbies as creatures are required to attack if they didn't floop, and still defend even if they are flooped on your opponent's turn. This by itself makes the game much, much simpler and easier to teach to CCG newbies as combat shyness is one of the things that can slow early games of Magic down to a crawl.

The two decks in the Finn vs. Jake box, are, unfortunately, not all that well-balanced. The Jake deck is much easier to play, as it is more of a straight combat deck with bigger creatures that can hit harder and some cards that punish the Finn deck for having too many cards, but the Finn deck, despite its weaker creatures, is much more powerful as it has strong card drawing and card-reuse effects. At one point I was able to draw 3 cards a turn, every turn, and my opponent had a very hard time dealing with the sheer number of options I had access to. In general, it is just much more synergistic with multiple combos and multiple ways to put those combos together. Some tweaking of the Jake deck with a few cards from the boosters could likely make it a fair game though and is the main reason why I'm thinking of investing in the boosters.

Overall, if you're used to much more complex games like Magic this is nothing fantastic, but people who aren't as used to heavier titles are going to have a much easier time here and the game does have some amusement factor and clever decision space.

A great combat deckbuilding alternative to some of the big kids on the block.  If you thought Adventure Time was going to leave this as too young and light on strategies or depth, you're missing out on a GREAT deckbuilder.  The terrain bonuses and effects make it a truly unique game where you design your deck to work for YOUR style.  You can either play it standard out of the box versus OR you can play it like an MTG alternative where you pick and choose cards from the expansions and many decks to form your own battle deck.  Well worth investing time into this and has become a massive staple entry into my game group.

I'm still not sure on these types of game, but certainly when compared to Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh! this is a much better, cleaner game.  Also something nice about playing this game after the cartoon episode to give it better context.  Rated as 7 as I would happily play with my son (getting him to play is still a problem!) (Rating 7; July 14). UPDATED: Unfortunately, my son would rather play with the app than me, and its not the game I would want to play with adults.

One of the better sets in the series of Card Wars. Jake's corn deck is way overpowered in this set. I think I've only had Finn's blue deck win once out of the 15-20 games I've played with this set.

A card-game based on a fictional card-game in the fictional world of the popular animated television series "Adventure Time". The game is rough around the edges, has severe balancing issues, and is only playable one-on-one. While it's amusing to see the card art and descriptions, and definitely keeps in flavor with the zaniness of the show, the charm eventually wears off and the game becomes dull and frustrating.

I rate CCGs and their expandable cousins (LCGs, etc.) on this basis: "I will likely never invest in one again, but assuming that someone else hands me a deck here's what I think of the game."

This reminds me of a very light version of Magic, sort of like only being able to play creature deck vs. creature deck without too much depth. Out of the box, it's reasonably enjoyable but not a game I would every clamor to play.

I suspect more depth lives in the deck construction layer, which, thanks to it being collectible, I'm unlikely to ever engage with. It's pretty quick to learn and play, and the cards are cute; it's fun to see cards from the episode where the game was first introduced.

After years of collecting dust I finally got to try this!  The rulebook is terribly written with a lot of the rules only expressed in the examples' text, not as actual rules.  The glossary and clarifications are also not even close to comprehensive.  Once you muddle through all the text and decipher the rules it's actually a pretty good game with an interesting lane control aspect.  I'll be buying other decks and bringing this for two player game options!

RATING: 6.9
This game is actually pretty great. The lane combat idea actually flows together fairly well, and the decks are balanced enough to cause furrowed eyebrows when something magical occurs. My sole concern is that, as a boxed set of two separate decks with a distinct thread of building custom decks out of new card packs and boosters, it doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. It's not specialized enough to be thematic, but not broad enough to allow personalization. But right out the box? A good play.

The adventure time card war starter packs I think do a great job of conveying that sort of semi-ridiculous card gaming feel, and each set is a good pairing. But don't mix and match, they aren't built to handle other decks.

Played Jake v LSP and it was terrible, Jake's cornfields steamrolled LSP's finicky play.

Jake v Finn though is a beautiful balance of corn power being slowly trashed by pig power.

RATING: 6
This is so close to being perfect in flavor and feel, and I love the art, but the game play is too basic to hold my attention.  I think the game needs a Calvin Ball element, where rules shift a little more drastically OR find away to do with out the creature hit points, which make the game fiddly and over long.  Perhaps a rock paper scissors elemental thing?  Also very disappointed with Cryptozoic's handling of the marketing after the success of this game.

This game is alright. It has some interesting hand management decisions, and some tight resource management. This game is fairly basic though, and feels a bit like a "starter" CCG. The biggest strikes against this game, are that I really do not want another blind purchase game and we already have several duel games of this nature. While this game is not terrible, I would prefer to play all of those other games.

Traded away in a Math Trade, early Jan 2015.

Originally purchased to see if I could get my spouse into 1v1 deckbuilder card games.  We both loved the theme, so it was worth a shot.  As it turns out though the game wasn't engaging enough.  It felt like a overly simplified version of MtG - which is a tough sell for when we're more aligned with playing Heavy Strategy games like Twilight Struggle.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
As I write the comments I can't help but being drawn back to Magic time and time again. I liked the idea and concept behind the "lanes" of attack and being forced to attack.  However I think the two factions right out of the box don't really let the whole system or experience shine.

The game is a bit light, which isn't bad for what it is.  I agree that it is very much a "Magic Lite" type of game, but for what it is worth I think I would rather play Star Realms or Ascension as light deck builders.

The issue really becomes would I choose to play this again?  Probably not, but by the same token I don't think I would veto the game if someone really wanted to play it.  

The IP, much like in Lords of Waterdeep can draw non-gamers in but I think the latter has a much better game behind the IP.

Completely imbalanced! Corn wins all the time unless Blue gets extremely lucky.

Solid game, as a casual card game. Lots of fun, very easy to learn. Quality game players should give a try out.

You get 2 actions and 25 life. 4 lanes to summon creatures that attack each turn unless they have used a Floop (activated ability)ability. You attack until creatures in the lane opposing you are dead. Then you can attack the opponent directly if no enemy creature opposes your attack. 1 creature per lane though, but when you attack or defend you simultaneously battle and deal damage to each other. Very simple battle mechanics, with buildings (enchantments from MtG) spells and thats pretty much it.

FLOOP THE PIG!
An absolutely hilarious and fun card game especially for Adventure Time fans!
It is sort of one-sided (Finn counters Jake).

I refer to this as "babies first Magic."  It's a little unbalanced but a fine 2 player filler.

As an avid card game player (long time competitive MTG player also) I was pleasantly surprised by this game. I have now played several games with mutiple people and using both decks. 

The balance was good, with each deck being cleverly counteractive to the other. There are a few card wordings that could have been better clarified but most isuues are well addressed in the rule book with specific card rulings (similar to most of Cryptozoic's other games.) 

Has a lot of room to actually be "played" and has room for players to make skilled choices and plays too. I am, however, in doubt about customised deck building aspect although I have not tried it yet personally.

Fun to play with kids, but a bit too basic for my tastes otherwise. Captures the spirit of Adventure Time surprisingly well, and this is definitely the better of the two starter sets.

Fun game about card combos. The four preconstructed decks all play totally differently, and you can build your own deck however you want.

Unfortunately the company decided to make this into a CCG format once they realized how marketable the game is (even after stating that they would not release random boosters), so I won't be buying any more than these two base sets.

Sold.

This is really the start of it all so in reality this comment encompasses my overall thoughts about this game.

Card Wars is supposed to be something I should hate.  A blatant fan service money grab by Cartoon Network and Cryptozoic.  Cartoon Network has been releasing Adventure Time 'thematic' DVDs before releasing full season versions to double dip in collector pool.  And you would have to be a zombie (or should I say walker?) to not know what an entertainment franchise whore Cryptozoic has become.

An additional caveat.  I am only playing with unmodified, two player starters and the Heroes because then I can also assess Card Wars as a board game (more on that later).  I also abhor CCGs and refuse, ever again, to fall prey to the money gouging that format brings.

Whatever is above, I like this game.  It is simple for a straight card game.  However, the lane tiles provide a board game experience, by creating a physical area where  mandatory battles between ready opposing creatures are waged and damage is dealt.  Card Wars implements a lane or province system into a card game much better than the more complex L5R CCG.

Card Wars is a solid light filler game that would also be great as a gateway into XCGs (LCG, CCG, etc.).  But with some adventures you may get in over your head so watch out opening that gate for anyone with a potenital for obsession.

A fun little romp but Finn's deck is built specifically to beat Jake's deck, giving one player a strong advantage, while not as imbalanced as the Bubblegum/LSP starter it's still a little unfair and I would suggest getting this if your kids want to play with you.  That way you can be Jake, and they can be Finn, giving them an advantage, but not so strong of one that you'll lose every match.

I must confess that I bought this game mainly because of my fascination of the excellent animated TV-series. For a long time I have been a huge fan of the artwork and the intriguing storyline. I was with great pleasure that I discovered that game is good as well ... actually really good. I might not be M:tG but is a nifty customisable card game that offers a lot of depth and strategy (hidden behind the cartoonish artwork).

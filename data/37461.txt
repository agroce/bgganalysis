Only tried the quick version of the game. I like the artwork. Not enough decisions to make. Not enough options. Plays only with 4 players. There are some bluffing elements but my overall impression is that there is not enough game in this game. Maybe this changes in the full version, maybe not...

No játszottam egy négyszemélyest. A kimondottan vacak kategória. Gyerekeknek autóskártya jellegű, pedig több akar lenni, de a lapok miatti szerencse olyan nagy, hogy gyakorlatilag olyan mint az autóskártya. :D

RATING: 4
The board looks great (although I would have preferred a matt finish and the yellow/orange icon colour backgrounds were too similar).  Using boxes instead of screens to hide the cubes was very clever.   The cards are very nicely illustrated.  The partnership aspect works fairly well.  A little like King of Siam.  But it was quickly clear who was which colour and you had to promote that to win the 'ply off'.  As it was our team was equal throughout and I won simply because of the identity of my priority card.  Not entirely satisfactory.  The game play was very card draw dependant.  I wanted to like this game but sadly I did not find it a very satisfactory gaming experience.  No one was keen to play more than the year one.

RATING: 5
there's something undeniably INTERESTING about this game, but I'm not sure that it's really all that fun.  

Normally when a game has "lots to look at" it normally translates into tough decisions and "lots to do".  Krakow definitly seems to have tons going on, but it ends up feeling more distracting than compelling.  

The joy of having a hand of cards that need to be played one-by-one is the strategic "puzzle solving" of evaluating your hand and planning the order in which you play out of it but I've never really managed to this in Krakow.  

I do get the sense that after a few more plays a quality game might emerge but only after all 4 players have had the same amount of experience.  It seems unlikely that I'll convincing 3 other people to "fly through the flak" of multiple awkward early games in order to get the proper experience.

As a result I think this interesting game will likely remain low in my rankings

Basically trick taking and area control.  It feels like it could have been done better.

RATING: 4.5
Disappointing. The production is excellent (Z-man like I would say), and the artwork and fluff are very enjoyable. The game does try to offer something new to tricktaking games by letting the players place cubes on some goals, however the trick taking mechanic itself is quite boring, simplistic and non innovative, to the point I would say this is the worst trick taking mechanic game I've played. Feels like the game needed 6 more months of developing. Balances are ok, but the main mechanic offers very limited strategy.

Rather interesting combination of a partnership tricktaking cardgame with a area control boardgame. The partnership mechanic really makes this game shine so the three player version I played seemed a bit far fetched. The partnership part combined with the hidden identities makes for a very interesting game which I want to try again very soon. The flavour text on the cards is very very funny.

I really wanted to like this game but it was a terrible experience.

Totally luck dependent, no (zero, rounded up) hand management, no meaningful choices beyond the obvious, no meaningful interaction, total lack of any meaningful information.

We played 3 years and in the end we couldn't understand why we didn't stop after 2 or 3 seasons. All of us wanted to like the game and were just waiting and waiting for something interesting to happen in these nearly 3 hours.

Nobody had the feeling that playing well beyond doing the obvious is possible at all and that any decision beyond the obvious is reasonable.

While I wouldn't really classify Krakow as a trick-taking game, it does take that sort of element and build an entire game around it, which is neat.

Basically, each "trick" does two things.  If successful, the trick determines where the winning team gets to place some influence for area majority-type scoring at the end of the round.  This area majority scoring will benefit both you and your partner.

However, the color led in the "trick" also matters, as each player secretly is hoping that a certain color wins more often, as it will score points for him personally at the end of the game.  So, players are torn a bit.  Let's say I'm the red player, and the other team leads with a red card.  I don't really want the other team to get influence on the board, but I do want the "trick" to succeed, since a successful red "trick" is good for me personally.  Very good decisions, and without totally throwing the partnership aspect out the window.

This is the main thing Krakow does really well, taking a partnership game, but still making it where only one player wins in the end.  There are several games like this, but most fail to do it well.  In Krakow, you are definitely incentivized to work with your partner, while also trying to eek out some points selfishly through a hidden role system. Very well done!

Even though the game is well done, I still felt like the game overstayed its welcome a bit for the amount of control players have.  It still has the trick taking vibe where some rounds you just won't have a ton of control due to the hand you were dealt. In the standard game you'll play a total of 56 tricks, which doesn't sound like much, but there's some upkeep each trick and the decisions aren't as straight forward, so each trick ends up taking a little longer than a typical trick taking game.

So, good game, but a little long for what it is, costing it a point in my rating.

Fantastic Card Game. You play opposite your team member against two others. But while playing as a team you also play for your own colour and at the end you add your individual colour to the team points you have acquired through the game due to taking area majorities due to the cards played each round. Very Novel, Clever and fun. 6 Plays.

My rating assumes we played correctly. I'm not sure we did. The game felt excruciatingly devoid of any of the interest of either a trick-taking game or an area control game. And the partnership aspect didn't work at all. I have to believe it was taught wrong given my GBs comments.

This game had some very interesting game mechanics with "team" play and hidden factions. I thought it was long and too random for my tastes. Being joined to the hip with a team means your biggest ally is also the hardest person to beat (assuming your team is ahead). If your team is losing, well you'll just have to gut it out as the game has no catch up mechanisms other than luck. The cards probably need some future revising as they are not colorblind friendly. Update: Now that I played Tichu I can see where this game got some inspiration from. Sadly, its worse than Tichu. Lowered rating to a 2.

Krakow 1325 AD (from here on abbreviated as 'Krakow') is two games rolled into one. The first game is something like a trick-taking game in the style of Bridge or Klaverjassen (a very popular game in this part of the world). Although I believe Krakow shares some concepts with a 'true' trick game, there are some differences too. I'm no expert and you'd have to search a little for yourself to find out what they are. In any case, after a trick is won, the winning card is moved to a special deck which at the end of a series of tricks will be sorted out according to their 'suit', recognisable by a colour. At the end of the game, players reveal their own personal colour which they have been keeping a secret throughout the game, and calculate their end score based on the combined total of the amount they scored with their partner as well as the amount they scored with their secret colour. Important to note is that the game requires you to team up with another player who will help but ultimately also work against you. All caveats and pitfalls where two players play as a team but do not know each other's cards apply—meaning this game just makes me want to howl and run away in terror. So that is the first part. The second part is an area majority game which completely falls flat, becoming dull and muddled, if the card game is not understood or appreciated. I saw (and still see) little point in exploring its intricacies given that I'm no good for the cardgame at all. To sum it up: ss far as I can tell it is not a broken game, so it is spared the humiliation of a 1, but I'd rather not play a game at all than that I have to play this.

I feel I owe an apology to the designer: I usually try to be somewhat lenient on Dutch designs because it's not often that something interesting comes out of this small country of ours, but regrettably Krakow manages to press all my wrong buttons. Het spijt me zeer, maar ik hoop dat je het begrijpt...

The Good
> Funny art and text on the cards
> After only 1 play I can imagine lot's of different strategies and tricks
> The balance to play with your teammate - but at the same time trying to screw him is very nice
> Components are top-notch, especially if you consider this is a self-published game.

The Bad
> Can't think of what this game has to do with medieval Krakow - yep, theme's pasted on here
> More cards to influence the situation on the gameboard are welcome.

The Verdict
Nice cardgame mixed with some area-control. Playing 1 year is long enough to keep things interesting.
Would I want to play it again? Sure, but competition is heavy. Furthermore, I missed a "click" with this game. I guess future plays will probably unravel lots of dirty tricks and strategies. However, if I won't play Krakow again in the future, I could live with it.

Combines a few interesting concepts like area majority scoring, team play of cards (tricks), and some hidden scoring.   There is a lot to consider when playing your cards, from simple card value plus or minus, to the regions it affects, how to get the lead, etc.   That makes it interesting, but a little slow-paced as a result.  However, there isn't a lot of control, and after 8 rounds (2-years), the game feels just a wee bit too long.  Seems like a pretty good game is in here, but could use some sort of refinement.   Fun, though.

An area control with a trick card game. Interesting idea, gorgeous map and card illustrations but a little longer than it should be.
A game that you work for the team never losing a opportunity to play for your personal family. It's arsh if the teammates have opposite families.
Good one, give it a try.

The concept was great for this game: A partnership game where each individual has a secret role.  Throughout the game you and your teammate try to win tricks to play influence in the castle in an area control manner.  At the end of the game you find out who each player is and the tricks of their color will score them points.  Whoever get's the most point will cause their rival to lose points.  It sounded so great in theory but failed in it's execution.  Thankfully I have a few other partnership games to play.  I have to admit the artwork and flavor text is delightful however.

Overwrought game that feels like it should have gotten more development to refine the ideas, take some of the peripheral stuff out of the game, and make the hand management more interesting.  The board play needs either to be made more interesting or to be removed entirely.  As it stands, the "cubes and regions" part of the game feels half baked.  We played the one-year game.  I can't imagine how painful playing all three years would be.

Gets an extra rating point for good artwork and for naming a card "Wawel Dragon."

RATING: 7
Only one play.  It took much longer then anticipated.  I think that there is a 'illusion' that there is so much information on the cards.  But, I think it's somewhat of a trap to over analyze that information.  I think that overall the basics of the card (color, high/low, where, special/strong) is what's important.  Otherwise you get caught up in all these calculations that become moot 90% of the time, because it really mostly matters if you are leading and you may not get a lead at all.

So, while I think there is some strategical choices to be made on where (when) cubes are put on the board and what color cards you let succeed, I think the actual decision on which cards should be used, should be more tactical.

Egy parti után 6 és 7 között vacillálok.
Gondjaim vele:
- a véletlen erős szerepe: a kártyák leosztása, a játékosszínek, az évszaksorrend, az érmejelzők felrakása, blokkolás lehetősége,
- erős számértékű kártyák, amikkel ugye nagyobb a kör nyerésének esélye, több jelzőt raknak fel a kerületbe,
- spéci kártyák gyenge számértékűek, így rossz az esélyük, nem is nagyon jöttek be,
- a kvázi-kooperáció szvsz elég gyenge, azt hittem jelentősebb lesz a szerepe.
Egy partiból felületesen ennyi.

RATING: 5
After a single play. Krakow has a fun and well-developed theme, but the game itself was a disappointment. Card play is the heart of the game, but decisions are limited in scope as most of the time you are looking to play the highest value cards in your hand. The low-value cards with special abilities seem too risky to start as Intrigues, whereas the high-value cards are rarely blocked. Because of the focus on winning Intrigues, the placement of tokens in influence boxes is of secondary importance and this whole aspect of the game (including the board) is largely superfluous. The team-play is a good idea, but the Secret Identities and individual scores only come into play towards the end of the game and it seems that you can only afford to focus on promoting your Secret Identity if your team is in the lead.

All in all, the game is too dependent on the chance of the card draw and is too long for what it offers.

RATING: 6
initial rating 4 players Essen 08 - partial game only

After hearing the rule explaination I knew it was my kind of game right away, trick-taking in teams, area control and hidden identities which are always fun. Its quite and original game with a very nice theme even though it incorporates things we all know, just in a very different way. 

Once playing the game it started to take on a very Knizia type feel, on your turn you are playing one card but there is a great amount to think about and consider before you play that card. Basically you or your partner will lead a card that you will hope goes on to be successful, in other words the power of your teams cards must be higher than the opponents, powers being numbers 1 - 7 I think which are added up between the players. 

Successful cards, depending on which ones you played, will allow you to place influence on a certain area of the board. They might also win you some gold which at the end of a year players secretly allocate to places on the board ala the sneak attack Castillo effect in El Grande. There is a brilliant big twist here in this whole scheme of things, players are NOT trying to win as a team, they need to work together to get ahead of the other team yes but each player has their own secret agendas as well!

Each player has a secret identity and each character in the game has an enemy. If your enemy faction wins too many tricks, now remember you don't know who exactly the enemy is just that you don't want those TYPE of cards being succesful, it ends up being bonus points for them and negative points for you at the end of the game. Each time your playing cards you are thinking about the enemy, trying to get your faction cards to win, trying to get your team card to win and stopping the enemy. As you can see you are being pulled in several directions, love that part. Also love the accusations that buzz around the table helping to add some fun. At the end of the game, team points are scored again but then INDIVIDUAL points are also scored and there is only one winner! 

The only knocks I can give here are I think the numbers on the cards probably should have been on the same side for ease of use, I see why it was done the other way but I at least would of liked them all on one side, very minor. The other is more obvious, being a card game luck of the draw can get you, I did notice in our one year game things were very 'swingy', one team would be dominating and then soon after the other was kicking butt but remember this was our first game and you really need to play 2 years not one when you play so I'm not sure yet how big of part the luck will play. I suspect a 60 to 90 minute play time for 2 years once familiar. 

For those disappointed about the 4 player only status, don't despair! There is already a 3 player variant in the works and after talking to Peter in depth about it I see great promise! 

[u]UPDATE:[/u] 7.5 => 6.5  Oh oh. It looks like the one year play I had originally may not have been enough to see a potential flaw here(well seen some luck but this is different). I'm still not sure but after another short test run it might be there isn't enough skill involved in the card play. It seems you just throw out your big cards and hope they succeed, hands seem kind of restrictive in this way, you either have a card and play it or you don't. Card counting could help a little but there are too many out of play cards. Compared with something like Spades where trump plays a part in the skill of play that part is missing here. 

I love the game design and all the ideas that work together so I hope the card play itself will prove to be skillful because that is the core game.

Interesting mix of trick-taking, area majority and hidden identity. Lots to take into account; winning tricks for your team in order to gain majorities on the board, while also letting *your* color tricks succeed without giving away that they are in fact of your color.

Mechanically sound. A fun game - particularly if you are into trick-taking games. :-)

RATING: 7
Some nice subtle interplay and decision making going on here.At it's heart is the nice balance between open points scored for your partnership and hidden points scored for yourself. Most of the time you'll play to improve your partnership's position, but every now and then you might just choose to lose a winnable trick because it's in your personal interest.

You need to watch the board position. It may be worth burning a card you'd rather save for a later lead to support a trick because the board payoff is worthwhile, while othertimes some tempting tricks will be essentially worthless when the board payoff is in an area that's no longer contestable.

Nice graphics and good production values too.

Krakow 1325 is easy to describe yet quirky to play. Four players split into two teams vying for control of the city. You play four sets ("seasons") of seven tricks. The team that wins the trick claims territory on the board as indicated by the high card of the trick. So, just like it sounds, a trick-taking engine drives an area-control scoring system. Beyond that, each player has a secret identity that matches one of the four suits of cards in the game. At the end of the game, your score is the sum of your team performance and the performance of your suit. You'll pull ahead of your partner if you can ensure more successful tricks of your suit than theirs, which must be deduced from their play. The tension between open teams and hidden identities adds excitement to an otherwise straightforward game. If there's a missed opportunity here, it's the game's unintegrated sense of humor. The illustrations and flavor text are hilarious, but they have so little to do with the gameplay that I quickly found myself refering to cards by their suit and numerical value - "a red +6," "a green -9," etc. Quite unfortunately, the cards reminded me of Ninja Burger: funny to read aloud the first time and stale thereafter. Krakow 1325 certainly stands out from the crowd, but for now I'm filing this one as "good but not great."

Not a bad game. I liked the Area control/trick taking/team/individual mechanics in the game. The theme was okay as well.

I felt the game itself was a little long for what it is as well as there is a separation and lack of control in regards to cards - they are far too powerful and too randomized. They have a huge impact for the endgame with the individual scores but there isn't a ton you can do about the strategy. The game kinda fell flat with me because of it.

I really liked the production quality of the game as well as the bits. I look forward to see what this designer has next on his plate.

RATING: 7
This is overall a pretty good game; certainly deserves better than the 1445-spot in the rankings. There are a few pieces that bug me a little. For one, I think it could've used more cards so that you're not constantly playing with roughly the same hand. The part that really bugs me, though, is the pseudosecrecy of your treasury. Anyone who's paying attention knows how much money is in their opponents' moneybags, so why bother covering it up? It doesn't seem from the rules like players are prohibited from tracking this information on, say, a piece of scrap paper, so I don't get it. Why bother with a secret treasury? Seems unnecessarily fiddly. Easy fix - just leave it uncovered until it's time to allocate money at the end of the year.

That said, there's some taut play in here. It's really, really hard to balance playing your secret identity vs. playing to win with your partner, and I got blown out of the water because I kept ending up with Green block cards when I had the Red identity. If I hadn't taken those chances to wrest control from the other two players, though, my team would've lost VPs. While the decisionmaking was a little fun, I felt like too much of the game depended on the luck of the draw. I'd certainly play this again, and perhaps buy a copy if I saw one around for cheap, but I think it could use a little more work.

Kill me now. Ugh, what a terrible game--it's like a dressed up game of War. Yes, War, the game played with a standard deck of cards--"Oh, your card is bigger than mine. You win this one." The theme is meaningless, there's too many spaces on the board, and the team thing is boring, like everything else about this game. Fail

Krakow does have one clever idea: team play with only one winner. Other than that it is a dull game mostly devoid of control or interesting decisions and if you happen to have bad cards, there is very little if anything you can do. Rarely have I seen cards with as bad flavor texts as Krakow - why even bother giving the game a historical theme if you use the flavor texts for non-thematic attempts at humor?

Played this game at Spiel 2009, Essen (but we only played 2 seasons) and liked it, it had a game mecanism that I hadn't seen before. Next time we played 4 seasons and the game just diden't work. Now I have finally tried to play 3 years (game years, not in real life!) and the joy I initially found came back, so if you play, play more than 4 seasons! 
I really like the mecanism! You play on teams, 2 vs 2 players, but your partner can also be your sworn enemy.
I have thought of making a houserule so that scoring the city areas gives your team additional points.

RATING: 7
After one play, I found this game to be enjoyable.  Sure, there is a fair bit of luck of the draw in the game, but it is mitigated to some degree by being able to choose from 9 cards when there are only 7 tricks.  It definitely proved quite dangerous to play the strong cards in a suit as they were frequently blocked and taken out by their respective low value blocker special card giving the other team points and cubes.  Interesting interplay between area majority and card play as well as bringing in some decision making regarding how much you may or may not support your team member if the other team is winning the trick with a card belonging to your faction which will score you points in the end.  Also, some areas are much more difficult to get into on the board which also may determine what card you lead/play.

Up front admission: This is not the sort of game I would expect to like.

Opinion: I strongly disliked this when I played it at BGG.CON 2008. The combination of partnership plus a secret identity was at least interesting. However, actual play was boring. Trick taking (mostly luck) with a mostly uninteresting area majority mechanic, in a game that would take entirely too long to play to conclusion.

We gave up without even completing the first game year of play, and we were all pretty happy to do so.

RATING: 6.5
I finally got a chance to try this at bgg.con.  I really enjoyed the partnership aspect, but the individual victory conditions add a nice bit of intrigue.  I think by the second or third play, veterans will be able to complete the full game in 60-90 minutes and the game packs a lot into that time frame.   

A fluky hand or two can skew the scoring in a round, but I think this can be balanced out by playing the full three years and the individual colors determining final victory.   You must focus on earning points via the partnership while also making sure that your color does well (or ensuring that your enemy color does poorly).

RATING: 7
The starting downside is that you can only play with exactly 4 players, but other great games have the same restriction (Tichu to name one) so that's not a downside for me. I like the decision you're faced when the lead card is presented - if it's not your secret colour but your partner played it, will it give enough compensating board presence for your team in order for you to support it and win the trick; if it's your colour but the opposing team played it, do you let it go through and play small, as inconspicuously as you can, so that your individual secret score will go up despite your opponents gaining board presence in the area majority scoring at end of year. I also like the card tracking from season to season, noting how the best "winning" cards are gradually removed from the deck with each season. Plus there's some special powers. All this is a bit to keep track of which leads to the main downside, being too much downtime for a card playing game. This is exaggerated because you can play any card to any trick, meaning you're continually rifling through wondering what to keep for later and what can you afford to pay now. At least until you're more familiar with the cards and the best way to play out. There's enough for me here to explore though, hoping the game will get faster with repeat play with the same players, and that we'll then lead to cagier games about what secret colour each player is progressing.

I guess I am allowed to rate the game I designed as long as I hereby solemnly promise to be totally unbiased about it !

I will never say no to playing a game of Kraków, because even after 120+ games (and explaining a demo game 50 times) I am still fascinated by the interaction of the card game and the board. To see the board shaping up in terms of area control, while keeping a close eye on the Intrigue cards used and out of the game, is still a lot of fun.

To cheer and high-five with your partner one moment, then double-cross him/her the next trick, still gives me a guilty sense of joy!

Since I will probably still be forcing my grand-children to play this at my death bed, I am happy I like it so much!

RATING: 6
Based on one play: The concept is good, play a trick taking game with an area majority game. The game is played in teams, but there is an individual winner. Try to win tricks in teams to score cubes on the board, these give your team points, but the card used to win the trick gives the individual points. The problem is that each card also has a power and possibly a counter card, which adds memory to the game and since all cards are not in play, some randomness. At the end it was too much memory and you go with your gut, trying to just win tricks.

I absolutely love the theme and style of this game - it's really captured my imagination.
But I do have some reservations about how frustrating the game can be when you get a weak hand of cards and just end up helplessly losing round after round. Admittedly this is after only one game, and I will gladly re-evaluate after more plays.
For now, gameplay gets a 6 but the theme, the art, the quirky charm and the humour elevate it to a 7.

RATING: 6
Lots of interesting stuff... but probably too much interesting stuff. A complicated filler, that is a hand management trick-taking pseudo-partnership area majority game, with hidden information and secret goals. Everything matters, but unfortunately the information that is hidden (i.e. what cards the other players have) matters far more than the information you do have, so you're making 'guesses' more than 'decisions'. There is so much to consider when deciding which card to play, but in the end skill matters little. Pick one and hope for the best. And that is if you were lucky enough to get good cards in the first place. For a game of this length, it's very luck-based and fiddly.

Playing it is a lot of fun. The trick taking, hand management, and secret identity parts make for a good gaming experience. If that's all your after, I can recommend this game. Personally, I think it's a very clever and interesting game, but not really one I look forward to playing again. Not when I can get the same feeling from games that are shorter, more elegant, easier to grasp, and offer more meaningful decisions and control.

Krakow is a trick-taking game where the (beautiful and often funny) cards have more information on them than magic: the gathering cards. The bits and rules are complex and obtuse, but the gameplay is not. It's random and swingy, which makes for a fun time while playing, but also leaves you feeling unfulfilled when the game is over.

RATING: 3.5
Game I really wanted to like but fell flat.


Trick taking games are all about controlling how your opponent's play their cards. So you take advantage of players who still have cards (or no cards) of a particular suit, for example.

I suppose this is the case for Krakow, but you simply do not follow suit. Each card has a particular value depending on the suit of the card led. At first playing, there is no apparent pattern in these values on each card. Also, there is another set of values -- the values change depending on whether you're playing a card to support your partner or playing it against your opponents. So on each cards there are eight different values, a specific area on the board on which you may play influence tokens if you win the trick, and some other special power depending on the card.

Consequently, I'm assuming your first games will be very, very slow until you get accustomed to the cards. However, I don't have much of a desire to try this again.

First, not all the cards are dealt out per round, somewhat increasing the luck factor since you have no idea throughout the round if a card is in play or not. Because of the relatively loose card play rules, it's hard to "force" an opponent to dump certain cards. And the apparent lack of a pattern when it comes to the data printed on the cars make every round almost impossible to plan. The trick play makes the game feels more like a card driven wargame. The huge amounts of data on each card make each round drag much longer than a trick taking game.

RATING: 7
Beautifully presented artwork/game. Play in teams of two, working to win hands of cards in order to obtain gold or control in areas of the city for your team.
However, you also have a hidden identity & so you want to ensure cards of your faction win the hand as these will, later in the game, give points just to your faction!
Good fun, made better with more plays!

I enjoyed this game more when I readjusted my perspective of the depth and strategic complexity from tactical area majority to a lighter and more chaotic trick-taking game.  It really is more of a solo game masquerading as a partnership and then further obfuscated by a complicated looking board and cards packed with detail.  I want to try it again now that I have a better grasp of what it is (and what it is not).

RATING: 4
A trick-taking card game, where each successful trick allows you to place ownership markers in an area-majority contest on the board. I usually like trick-taking games, but in this one I felt that there wasn't enough information on which to base decisions. The outcome of tricks was decided too often by luck of the draw and player chaos. My only play so far lasted far longer than the advertised 45 minutes, and completely outlasted its welcome.

Last friday, the Dutch Sinterklaas brought Krakow 1523 ad to our home. On Saterday and Sunday we had a couple coming over for playing games, and so we tried it. 

The first couple likes playing games very much but doesn't do it often. We first played a 1 year game to get te know the rules. After the year was ended, everybody shouted for more, so we played a proper 2 year game. 
Since the game is a nice mix between tactics, luck, teamwork and backstabbing, all of us enjoyed it very much.

On the second night we played with our regular playing friends. We immediatly played a 2 year game. It was quit the same experience for all as it was the night before.

Of course you have to play it more often to get te know the cards better so you can play more tacticly, but you always need a little luck in the end.

The secret identity gives the game a nice twist, and helps to get in the atmosphere. So does the material.

The game was very well recieved by both the tactital players as the more luck players. 

So in our game environment it will be set on the table many many times, i think (no, i know)

RATING: 5.5
It is an OK but overly complicated and excessively random trick taking game spread on top of a tired and worn area control game.  The board play is mostly uninteresting, and relies heavily on what you draw.  Because you can only place in sections that correspond to specific cards, your team can find themselves in a serious rut where they just can't compete in certain sections.

There is quite a bit of uncorrelated information on each of these cards and I constantly found myself frustrated by having to switch my hand stance in order to read everything.  I am sure that I missed blocker cards just because of the inundation of white noise on all of these cards.  Because of this, when playing cards the simple addition becomes complicated because I'm looking all over the card trying to find what I'm supposed to be looking at.  I admit that this may be because I'm mentally deficient. 

Conceptually, you want to keep your identity a secret, but who cares?  If blue is winning, people will try to stop it no matter who it is.  This seems like it would be especially frustrating for the partner of the player that has a winning color (eg. my partner in the last game I played). They can make points for themselves or work to prevent their partner from scoring more than them, thereby leading to self sabotage and giving leads to the other team.

The only thing that I found particularly interesting was the balance of dumping bad cards at the right opportunity vs taking the lead.  This unfortunately would have been more intriguing if you would have had to play out your full hand.  Because there is flexibility with spill over cards, I feel tension is lost.

I find the memory aspect of the game a bit unfortunate.  It is really in your best interest to remember the power/blocker cards that are thrown out of the game for the winning tricks.  I get irritated when I feel that I should be memorizing something in a relaxing game.  Also, the cubes should be open.  It is all trackable information, why should I have to try and memorize it.  

My last big gripe is that the game doesn't really build from year to year.  It merely resets, so in year two I was asking myself why this was still the same game.  There was no reason not to call a winner at the end of the first year and just play it again.  It isn't particularly advanced to just repeat yourself.  My only guess for this is that luck "should" bear itself out, but because the game loses its momentum every year, better to just see who got lucky in an appropriate amount of time.  Frankly, while it is quite enjoyable when played quickly in one year, it just doesn't merit the multiple hours of dedication for the "advanced" three year game.  A shorter game will lend itself to more forgiveness for randomness.

Still, as much as this sounds like a scathing review, the game is good enough (hence the 5.5). There are far worse games out there, and if you are looking for a clever take on trick-taking games, you might want to check this out just to see what can be done.

The card art is cute.  My favorite part of the game is the hidden penis in the upper left part of the Castle section.  Hello Little Mermaid!

A weird sorta-partnership trick-taking area majority game. After one partial game, I can't tell just how much control one actually has (i.e., skillful cardplay vs. luck of the draw), but I definitely want to try this again. 

Cards are full of information: color (suit), numerical strength (in each of the four colors, and varying depending on which color and whether playing for or against the color), and reward for winning (board area in which to place x cubes, and possibly cubes for the player). Players sit across from partner, but also have secret identities -- each with an arch enemy. If you lead and win the trick, your teams markers advance in value. Winning card goes in pile, resolved after 7 hands: these advance value of the various secret identities. players team markers advance based on areas controlled on board, then reset board  At the end of three years (each with 4 hands of 7 tricks), reveal secret identities. Only team in lead is eligible to win. The individual player (of winnin team) with highest positioned marker wins.

Very interesting area majority game with semi-partnerships and hidden identities. I tend to like games where the playing of cards plays a substantial role, and Krakow 1325 AD is such a game. The cards can be utilised in different ways, so it's always an interesting choice which card to play in an intrigue. You can play a high-value card to foil an opponent's intrigue, but then you can't use it anymore to start and intrigue of your own. So what to do?

The card play is often compared to that in trick-taking cames, but I completely fail to see why. You just play cards for their value in the colour of the current intrigue, either to support or foil it. The colours of the other cards played has no meaning at all, unlike in all trick-taking games.

The game is not without its weaknesses, though. I had the impression that blocking an intrigue is powerful enough, that doesn't need to be awared with an additional victory point. Blocking is more a question of being dealt the right card than of clever play. Also, the game seems somewhat repetitive, so three years is probably a bit too long . But a regular game of two years certainly is a enjoyable experience.

I think it may be too repetitive and luck dependent, and a with all the moves on the board it is a bit too heavy for being just a good trick-taking game, but some may like it.  My first play was quite enjoyable.

Nonetheless, it has nothing to do with neither city of Kraków nor Medieval Ages. It could be placed in Discworld as well, with better results I think. Unfortunately, in place of Mr. Pratchett’s clever humor we just got a couple of crude jokes about Catholic Church. Meh.

Kind of cool mechanisms, but I found it becoming slightly repetitive after 1 year. It's beyond me why you would want to play 3 years!
The 4 players only thing is also quite limiting!

Mikor elôször láttam nagyon megtetszett. Aztán játszottam is vele és akkor már nem tetszett. A grafika sajnos nem tudja ellensúlyoznia  játék gyengeségeit.

the game components are charming and good quality, funny to read all the cards when you are bored, the stories are nicely connected...
but there's too much of randomness in the cards, can't believe that one can pay attention to all the features... playing some and watching others playing it showed that most of the time one team is the superleader and the other just can't help it... too much luck, which is ok in a card game but this is an expensive way to have..
so, it hasn't reached my expectations :(

I don't quite like the semi-partnership scoring: I'm more comfortable either being a partner or not. The winning color +2, opposite color -2 rule seems unnecessary: why make the rich richer?

The cards are a total mess. The idea seems to be to fan them normally on offense and backwards on defense, but this means you don't see what special power and opposite strength you're spending to get the immediate effect. And for even this to work, you have to fan the cards keeping edges parallel, not fan them in an arc as usual. In practice you have to look at each card individually to find the one you want to play. The flavor text makes the cards even more confusing.

All those negatives accepted, it's yet another area control game. It's pretty, but annoyingly awkward to play.

A very interesting blend of alliances + hidden roles. I need to play it more however as the card play seems a little bit too random for my taste.

Krakow 1325 AD was designed by Peter Struijf, published by Geode Games, and beautifully illustrated by Melchior van Rijn. I first heard about Krakow from the Boardgame News Preview published back in September 2008. The game sounded intriguing, but I didn't give it a second thought until I came across the designer's series of articles about his experience at the Essen game fair. I've collected those articles on my website so you can easily find all of them in one place. As I mention in my introduction there, Peter's vivid and engaging writing style is marvelous. These articles really captured my attention and got me interested in Krakow, so much so that I bought it on a whim. I'm certainly happy I did. I've played it a number of times now and it gets better and better with each play, which is a welcome change of pace from many games that wear out their welcome with repeated plays. Krakow is a team trick-taking area majority game. Let's break that down because you don't often see all of those mechanics combined into one game. Krakow is a game for specifically four players, who divide into two teams of two. Krakow is a trick-taking card game along the lines of countless predecessors (e.g., Hearts, Tichu). Krakow is an area majority game where you score points at intervals for having the majority of cubes in a region (e.g., El Grande). Most importantly, underlying all of this, is the fact that a single person is declared winner at the end of the game, not a team. Each individual's score is the sum of their team score and the score of their secret identity, which is only revealed at the conclusion. You score points for your team based on securing majorities in areas on the board and you score points for your individual secret identity based on the color of the tricks that are successful (because each person is randomly assigned a secret color at the beginning of the game). This is really the meat of the game because it becomes a balancing act of working with your partner and betraying your partner at the right moment when it is most advantageous to yourself. There is significant tension between winning tricks for your team that allow the placement of cubes on the board, and supporting tricks of your individual secret color regardless of whose team it helps. There will come times when you want to undermine a trick led by your partner because its not your color and there will come times when you decline to wholeheartedly oppose a trick led by your opponents because it is your color. However, if you focus too much on your self-interest then your team is unlikely to function very well and you'll end up getting crushed. Krakow belongs in the Top 5 because it is a quirky and inventive game that has pleased everyone to whom I've taught it (and I haven't even told you about the  gorgeous and humorous artwork).

Very, very painful. I am willing to believe that if you have memorized the deck that it is possible to make interesting decisions, but without that knowledge it's nearly random. If this were actually a trick-taking game (i.e., with some sort of rules about following suit), or if the card values had some sort of simple pattern (e.g., always adding up to the same number), then one could play intelligently.

Even if I did know all the cards, this wouldn't interest me much since the board play is rather dull and the secret identity scoring is heavily dependent on what you happen to be dealt (in my game I was yellow and got almost no decent yellow cards).

1 play, 2 years. There is so much info on the cards that it is very hard to memorize what has been played, especially your partner's choices are interesting. If you get bad cards you're in trouble, and hope your partner can make up for this. So my early conclusion is that the main player in this game is Luck...

An excellent hidden gem that might be tough to track down for some people. Area control combined with secret teams with only one winner. I don't play this one nearly enough mostly because you need exactly four people to play, and I find it difficuly to find four people who all want to play this one at one time. Highly recommended if you can find the people to play.

Man, I wanted to like this one so bad.  One play left me cold.  To be fair, the stuff that attracted me to it in the first place is well done.  The theme is unique, lighthearted, and supported by both great art and flavor text.  The components are great throughout, from the high quality box and board to the great art on the cards.  The hidden roles aspect to the play adds a nice dimension.  The gameplay is where this game suffers for me.  The first and probably biggest problem for me is that the main mechanic is trick taking.  I generally despise trick-taking as a mechanic, and although I hoped that the theme would carry this game past that obstacle, it definitely didn't.  I had further difficulty with the design of the cards, where the negatives are on the wrong side of the card when you fan your hand.  I think this might be a game that's really great if you play it constantly, but I just have no interest in getting there.  I don't think there's enough here to get it past the first couple plays to the point where it is familiar enough to all players that it will really shine.  Very disappointed, because this had so much potential.

Fantastic Art, interesting gameplay, but, just you star you game, you don`t watch art, text and etc... just looking for more support point...
Secret identity, hhm.. like it, but but there is not as much in it as writen... just getting few points after year ends... And you can get that points because some one played succesful intrigue with your colour... Maybe I need to play more times, and it will be more clear for me... But all in all I like it :)
P.S. fantastic art !

comically overwrought trick taking card game with an almost superfluous board, but somehow by the end I decided I liked it. I feel that you could remove 50% of the rules overhead and still preserve about 90% of the meat on the bone. Despite that frustration, I am looking forward to playing again sometime. I like how you want your team to do well but at the same time you want to individually score more than your team mate. The tension arises when these two goals come into conflict. If you like trick taking with a twist and the above conflicting interests dynamic sounds interesting then I'd recommend looking into this. Narrowly misses the mark of a "buy"

Una specie di partita a briscola in coppiacon in più un gioco di maggioranze, si giocano infatti carte come se si giocasse insieme con il prorprio compagno ma la vittoria poi è singola bisogna capire bene quindi dove fare e dove lasciare i punti. Ottimi materiali per una produzione amatoriale.

This is a great game for exaclty 4 players.  A perfect combination of trick taking and area control.  Be aware up front that this isn't a gamer's game.  There is the luck of the draw to contend with as in any card game.  But if you like card hand management games you'll like the depth of this one.  You have to work with your partner while at the same time look after your own self interests if you want to win the game.  Also, you won't get a good feel for the depth of the game by just playing the 1-year version.  To really appreciate the need to cooperate with your partner you need to play the 2 or 3-year version of the game.  Possibly a perfect game for introducing trick-taking card game fans into boardgaming.  I would think that Bridge players would like this one as well.  Excellent components and the first time I've seen a tuck box included for the cards.

I love trick-taking card games.  So a partnership boardgame incorporating such mechanic as well as area majority seemed like a concept I would enjoy.  Unfortunately, although Krakow had a lot of interesting ideas, they just didn't come together very well as a whole.

For example, the hidden individual colors is a neat notion, but it is also a conflicting element against having a partner, especially if they happen to hold the opposing ones.  I'm not sure why it would be fun if every trick you win has the potential of giving your opponents points as well.

Then there is the fact that a significant portion of the deck isn't used each round/season, which adds a big dose of randomness into the gameplay.  I'm also not altogether convinced that the distribution of the number and power on the cards are balanced well.

I like certain aspects of Krakow, but ultimately I felt it was bogged down by an overly complex scoring with too much information crammed into the cards; and it proved that having a personal agenda will only hurt a partnership.

I'm concerned that there may be too much luck-of-the-draw:  Each game, one person has been [b]way[/b] ahead of the others.  I suspect it works out over the course of several "years", though, so it may not be a problem.

It's an area control abstract with an astronomy theme in which you hide or show your intentions for control. It's alright - but not my cup of tea. I've never been much of an abstract gamer though I've tried several. Production values are pretty weak and abstracts are not my thing, so not much to recommend for me.

Even though it's twenty years old, the mechanics in the game are very modern.  In some ways, it's best to be second, not first.  I'd need more than one play to pick up more of the strategies, which are probably more tactics than strategy.

Intriguing blind bidding game with players placing scoring stars onto constellation mats, and resolving them when they are full.  Excellent little game that doesn't go on too long, with some quirky scoring rules (Winner of a constellation plays everyone else but second).  If anyone has a spare expansion (the 13th constellation) please remember me! :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Essentially this is another blind-bidding game with some open information, as players put bid markers face-up and face-down on constellations worth various points.  The potential problem here is that it seems like you can win by neglecting many of your lower pieces and just playing your power pieces (10, black hole, and doublers) on the 8, 9, and 10-pt constellations while ignoring everything else.   I am not too much of a fan of the "clever" scoring system that penalizes the winner in each constellation, and often makes second place more desirable.  However, the main idea of the game is unique and I like it for that.

RATING: 8
Surprisingly good placement game with a nice element of bluff. Discs are laid out showing various constellations and players lay numbered plastic stars until they are filled and scored. The majority and second holder score points, but any other players get points from the majority, so it can easily be better to be second! Your stars are returned to you and the constellation is replaced. The clever bluffing is that the constellations have large and small stars. When you place your star on a small point, it goes face-up, but when you place on a large star, it goes face-down. You also have a black hole, which cancels adjacent stars (but adjacent black holes cancel each other) and 2 double stars, which double the value of adjacent stars. Because all the stars are turned up for scoring, you get some idea of when someone's black holes or double stars are available for play. A really good combination of placement, bluff, memory, maths and double think, it's a shame this game is out of print.

RATING: 4
Played 2 time. Not sure I'd want to play this all the time, but the simplicity of the game, coupled with the graphic presentation (including beautiful constellation disks) made this one a pleasure to play. Played with3 and 5 and felt too "player chaotic" with 5 since so much happens between turns. I preferred my playing with 3 players substantially.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game had a couple of very good ideas.  The board is split up into several constellations, not all of which are out at once so the board is fractured and ever-changing.  Also, this is a land domination game, but with incomplete information.  I really like the design of the pieces, and there are several different things to consider in your strategy.  Plus, the rules are very simple, and the game is short, which automatically gives it bonus points in my book.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a strange game in that it seems the best possible position is 2nd place as 1st place has to pay all other besides 2nd place out of their winnings. Art could use a lot of improvement, even a basic outline of what the constellation is suppose to be would be nice.

RATING: 8
A relaxing influence allocation game in which players use their hands of numbered star tokens to vie for first and (even better) second place in various constellations.  There's just enough bluff, hidden information, and sabotage to make this a cracking "longer filler."  It makes a fine choice for gearing down after an intense or exhausting game.

An interesting twist on a blind bidding game, Sternenhimmel has players bid on the stars in 12 astrological constellations, with the twist that giant stars are open bids, and smaller stars closed bids.

Each player has an identical mix of star-shaped bidding tokens that double local star values, black holes that erase local star values (if not erased by neighboring black holes) and actual numeric bid tokens.

When a constellation is filled with tokens it is scored, taking into account the effects of double stars, black holes and a total value and count of tokens for each player is taken for top bidder, with count being the tie break.

This is an attractive game, with simple components that plays quickly, almost a filler, and it's a nice add if you can find a copy. (Only published by Goldsieber and currently out of print.)  I gave it a 6.5 based on one solo 3-player game.

Nothing new, nothing special, a quite dry. And a bit of blind-bidding elements included. I've seen this kind of games a lot and Sternenhimmel isn't the best one in its genre. But yes, maybe I could play it again if someone suggest it.

RATING: 9
Who says "2nd place" isn't fun?!  In this light strategy game, the optimal score for each constellation is nearly always to win "2nd place".  It's really fun and a blast to use the black hole & binary stars (both on yourself and your opponents whenever suitable) to try for 2nd place...  

At it's heart lies a simple blind-bidding & bluffing mechanic in an elegant game with some decent strategic depth.  Everyone has the same set of stars to bid with.  The fun is in trying to outwit others for the top score which is "2nd place" without ending up in 3rd - 5th place.  Each constellation is different with neat twists: some stars are placed face-down and some faced-up; some are connected to each other and some not.  Where do you play and what star(s) do you bid with and when? 

I one of the few blind-bidding games that I really, really like.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fast area majority game where being first isn't always desirable as you must pay out points to anyone who finishes 3rd, 4th or 5th for each star they have in the system.  Second place is often the sweet spot as you will often score more points than the person in first.  Some stars are put face down so no one knows while most are placed face up.  Black holes can be played which destroy stars adjacent to it unless its another black hole which then cancel each other out.  Doubling stars double the values of the stars connected to it.

RATING: 2.9
Being a fan of astronomy you'd think this would appeal to me more but it kind of fell flat with me. Placing stars on constellation spaces just doesn't seem all that interesting to me I guess. Maybe a retheme is in order but I can't see that being worth it.

An early area control game where players place onto stars.  Some of the placements are face up and some face down (thus bluffing) and one has a hand of low to high values, some blackholes and doubling tiles.  Plays quickly and there are lots of placement options and a decent amount of strategy.  One key is to be able to quickly recycle your high-scoring pieces (you don't get them back until a constellation is scored).  I believe there's one constellation on the table per each player.

Sternenhimmel is a weird blind-bidding sort of area-majority game where your bids are not only associated with your intended support for a given area, but also associated with actions that can block, kick out, or otherwise affect other players' bids in the final revelation-of-bids phase. There's a bit of hand management, as you only bid on 3 or 4 areas at once [and deploy / allocate your bid markers there 'til they're full], but there are 12 in the game and you don't get your bid markers back from areas until they close [so if you leave them on things that aren't getting played into by other players, you'll be hamstrung to pursue new opportunities]. All this sounds pretty good, but I've only played it once and it wasn't terribly exciting. Still, I'm hoping to get more plays in.

Played a bit more lately. Nice player interaction, but limited information makes for more lovely tension. In trying to jack your opponent will you be hitting the mark or just ruining yourself? Or do you play a more conservative game but risk letting your opponents get away with murder?
Beautiful components and smooth game play make for a very pleasurable (but often tense) experience.

Very pretty game that for some reason feels almost relaxing to play.  Perhaps it's because the tension level isn't ratcheted up as high, but it's still quite good.
Upgraded my rating to 8 after realising that the game is better than I first thought - I had been playing without the "big stars = face down, small stars = face up" rule.  Playing with everything face down reduces the tension a fair bit, but playing it the right way makes the game MUCH better.

You don't see this one around very much. Very clever piece of game design and actually quite a tough game to play.

underrated light abstract game; a little bluffing in a worker placement game that can be played by just about everyone. like the mechanic that you don't necessarily want to be the 'winner' of the board (2nd usually nets more pts as 1st place has to pay out pts to others). Also concentrating all your workers on one board won't get you to victory.

Yet another area-control game.  The twist here is that (vaguely similar to Cardinals & Kings / China) the spaces in each area have connecting lines, and some of each player's pieces can double or destroy adjacent pieces.  The theme of the zodiac is well-represented, if relatively meaningless.  All in all... mostly harmless.

This is really a lovely game.  Light and easy.  This is really an engaging system, I like the mix between bidding and area control in this, and while it does have blind bidding there is more a sense of bluff to it rather than randomness.  The best things about this is the sense of geography that the game has, positioning youself for the block leads to some fine combos.  This lasts just as long as it should (30 minutes) which should put this into a frequently played filler. 

I've only played this with three but already this ranks high on my three player games list.

I been itching to play this game for a long while and thankfully Morgan pulled it out of his magic bag of games. A mix of a couple different games including San Marco (area control) and Reef Encounter (multiple boards). You connect hidden and exposed star tiles from your pool of 1,3,4,5,6,7,10, two double tiles and a blackhole to try and gain a majority and score the most pts. Constellation boards are worth different values for first and second depending on size. Thoroughly enjoyable and would love to see how this scales to 5. Would definitely play again.

10/14 - played again but this time with 5. Just as enjoyable. This is a good game for what it is. Forty five minutes of area control.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Interesting area-control game, but too little control with 5 players -- probably best with 3, or maybe 4.

All players have markers numbered 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, **, **, black hole. There are several boards with constellations drawn, stars marked with big or small stars. Each has a VP reward shown (x/y). Display n random constellations. In turn order, players place one of their markers: if placed on big stars, play face down; otherwise face up. Score a constellation when all stars have been played onto: all contiguous black holes are returned to players. Single black holes remove all other adjacent markers (returned to owners). The **s double all adjacent markers. Sum each player's markers; greatest sum gets x VP, second-highest gets y VP. Any other players with markers get 1 VP per marker, taken from the winner! Ties are resolved by #markers. For unresolved ties, players each get 1VP/marker from the bank. Scored constellation immediately replaced. Play through till all constellations have been scored. Most VP wins.

Rating after one play with three players. A well-balanced mix of tactics, bluff, gambling and a pinch of memory. Easy to explain and play and with a quick setup. Game components are quite nice, and the game took approx. one hour with three first-timers.
UPDATE: Played the game again a couple of years later. The game is still easy-going and fun, but has not aged that well (nowadays I like some tougher decisions than this game offers). Also, the fun you get out of it very much depends on the other players (and how much thought they put into each move).

After 1 Play: This game strips down the area control mechanic to as simple as it can be while still remaining fun.  Fun, but not unique enough to seek out further plays.

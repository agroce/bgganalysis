Clever use of theme (Jack and the beanstalk) in what would otherwise be an inventive abstract that probably would not have not caught the deserving attention. It felt a bit like Lost Cities as it is equally tense. It is really assimetric which helps the theme immensely, a huge plus for an abstract:) , you can feel the agility of Jack and the thunderous moves of the giant. I realy enjoyed and even though I'm yet to play with my wife I think it's safe to say she will like it too.

A unique 2 player asymmetric game where one player plays as Jack and the other plays as the Giant from Jack and the Beanstalk.  Each player's turn is very different and each player has different win conditions. 

Pretty cool and quite puzzle-ly. Maybe closer to a 7 than a 6 but its a in the right mood game for me.

RATING: 8
The asymmetric card play and different win conditions really make this game shine. The card art is beautiful and helps bring out what little theme there is. This is basically an abstract game using cards as the only luck in the game is the way the cards come out to begin with. It's definitely easier to understand how to play as Jack but I love the "arc" of this game where it gets easier for the Giant to win as the game progresses. Jack's first beanstalk will be easy, his second not too hard either...but that third one is a doozy!

RATING: 6.5
This is a small portable card game with strategy. It appears that it is much easier to play the giant, but I need to work on my Jack strategy. With many more plays, I think I can get a better idea of what strategies I should be utilizing.

Having only played this game one time at this point, my initial impression is mixed.  I really liked the fact that it was fairly simple to explain, and very quick to play.  I hope to play it a few more times rather soon, but until then, I am not sure how much replay value this will hold.  I hope each game will feel different depending on how the cards are dealt on the table, but I am not sure how that will play out. . .

RATING: 5
At first glance, and perhaps for the first few plays, the Giant will appear to be the much more difficult role. Jack can use three actions per turn, and can access the back of each stack, whereas the Giant has only one action, albeit a more powerful one. Effectively using this single action is incredibly challenging, and players should expect Jack to triumph until the deeper strategies unfold. The Giant's short term goal is to simply slow Jack down, and position the Fee, Fi, Fo, Fum cards into stronger positions, with the long term hope that in the later stages, the Giant is flirting with at least one of his many victory conditions. Being able to 'hide' treasures can help the Giant gain leverage and extend play, as can the occasional card removal, but despite being the thematic doofus, the Giant must play with much more cunning that one would guess. All told, The Blood of an Englishman is a good abstract game. I don't find the roles balanced, and the full information nature of the game slows it down a bit too much, but the challenge of winning as the Giant is well worth some investment.

Original juego de cartas para 2. Asimétrico, cuesta cogerle el punto al ritmo del gigante. Y aunque da la sensación de que el setup es media partida, tiene muchas opciones y miga después. Su principal pega es que se puede quemar rápido. Aunque su curva de aprendizaje y rapidez da para muchas partidas antes de que eso suceda.

Played twice, once as Jack, once as Giant.  Jack won both times.

I don't know what to think of this one, I do like the theme, although varying reviews say it either favors Jack or favors the giant.  In both games, the giant had no chance.  One Game the giant only removed cards and lost easily.

I'll have to play this a few more times to get the strategy.

RATING: 8
While I did the art direction on this game, I hadn't really played it until later. I thought it was maybe a cool concept, but would be a bit too dry and abstract for my gaming tastes. Wow, was I wrong. While it definitely has the feel of an abstract in some ways, the game was never dry or boring. The asymmetrical sides are nicely balanced, and the tension is always high. It's nice that the game is short enough too that it makes you want to switch sides and play again immediately. Good stuff.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a solid 2P asymetrical game.  Similar to Twilight Struggle, there is a power shift throughout the arc of the game.  At the beginning, Jack has a lot of options, but over time his options start to get squeezed and the Giant starts to become a real threat.  This makes for some interesting dynamics over the course of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Blood of an Englishman is a straightforward 2-player card game that fits the niche well for that type of game that straddles the border between filler and meaty.  So simple and yet many moments of tension.  A bit of a brain-burner as it is all open information, so AP will sometimes bog down the game. But it is quick-playing enough and simple enough that too much analysis is limited by the design.  Excellent implementation of the fairy-tale theme through the excellent artwork and some mechanic links as well.  Nothing revolutionary but overall a highly decent game!

RATING: 8.1
Just a super clever game. The first time I played it, I my opponent finished building his second beanstalk and was looking pretty smug. That's when I saw one move that would win me the game by simply moving four cards over from one stack to another. He was like "WHAAATT??" I had a smile on my face a mile long. I can see how this game can get a bit chess-like with players agonizing over every turn because with 100% open information, there is always going to be an optimal move if you stare at the cards long enough. But for me, that's a great recipe. This is an excellent experience. So far, my findings are that if two inexperienced players are playing the game, the Giant stands a better chance to win. But as players gain more experience, the Giant offers a more substantial challenge.

I bought this asymmetric, 2-player, game just because of the small box, art, and out of the hope that it would be an example of a good fairy-tale-themed game, and I was not disappointed!

The 2 sides (Jack v the giant) play quite differently and very thematically, with the slower, more destructive, giant abilities (e.g. move a chunk of 1 stack of cards) seeming too much for the quick, little, abilities of Jack (moving 1 card at a time), but it seems that it's actually easier for Jack to win. This slight off-balance is thematically-appropriate and, I think, adds to the game, so long as one of the players is up for the challenge.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Solid 2 player game that feels like competitive solitaire with one player taking control of Jack trying to collect treasure and climb beanstalks and the other taking control of the Giant trying to kill/stop Jack. Jack is allowed 3 moves of the cards per turn, none of which being overly powerful. The giant is allowed one move, all of his options leaning toward power moves. Seems balanced.

2017-11-17 - This is a good, fast playing, 2 player card game. It's surprisingly thinky, and each side really does play very differently. Worth checking out if you like quirky card games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The deck consists of 50 cards - 3 treasure cards (x2), 4 Fee Fi Foe and Fum cards (x2), and the rest are beanstalk cards numbered 1-9 (x4 each). The cards are randomly laid out in 5 rows of ten cards and at the start of the game Jack is allowed to move any one card to any location - as a way to mitigate a shuffle that favors the giant too much too early.

Jack's objective is to remove cards in order to build three personal beanstalks leading to each of the three treasures. The Giant's objective is to line up his four cards - Fee Fie Fo Fum - either along the front row of each column or grouping them altogether in one column. In both cases the cards can be in any order. The giant can also win by removing enough cards that Jack can no longer meet his objective. The actions that each player can take are different. Jack can primarily take a card from the front or back of any column to add to his beanstalk or move cards from back to front or from the front of any column to the front of another, small moves that enable him to build his beanstalks, each of which must consist of 6 cards in ascending numbers topped with a different treasure. Jack gets 3 actions while the giant gets one, but his action is more powerful. He can move groups of four cards from the front of one column to any other column, move two cards at the front of columns or remove a beanstalk card from anywhere from the game entirely.

Early on, Jack can pretty much build his beanstalks unimpeded, but he cannot start a new one until the previous one is finished. As the game progresses, Jack's options get harder as the giant either eliminates the cards he needs or gets close to arranging his Fee Fi Foe Fum cards for a win. The giant can slow Jack down by burying the cards he needs in the middle of columns that Jack cannot directly access. There have been a few asymmetrical two-player games of late and this is a very good one. Not sure if I can speak to balance yet, although the giant's objectives seem to pose a bit more of a strategic challenge, I think, than Jack's does.

Interesting game. Allows for a lot of strategy since all open information. I like the asymmetric roles as well and plays into the theme with Jack making quick small moves and the giant clumsy (fewer) big moves. I also like that it's quick to play and is the size of a deck of cards (the box is deceptively large for the contents). All of your available actions are listed on "cheat sheet" cards as well, which makes it even easier to play.

I think the biggest drawback I find is that the largest element of luck is found based on initial distribution of cards. I prefer games that have their introduction of chance distributed throughout the game (with mitigation methods). There is a small mitigation in that Jack can move one of the cards at the start. In this sense, it can feel like you're behind from step 1 if the board is laid out in a certain way.

RATING: 6
Really clever 2p game. Has an interesting dynamic between the Jack player, who gets 3 minimalist actions on his turn, and the giant player, who gets 1 massive action on his turn. I think the game might be weighted towards the giant, but I need more plays to be sure. Some of the game certainly is affected by the setup, though Jack does get one free move of any one card. I really dislike fanning out cards and moving them around, but I suppose it can't be helped. 

I'm still not completely sold on this one, but I'd like to keep it around to play further. I do think that there's some underlying depth here, at least for the Jack player, that I'd like to explore. It's interesting that this game is so tense despite having perfect information. I'm starting to think Renegade is less and less of a reliable publisher though. Their games always seem to just barely miss the mark for me, and I'm afraid to say that this might have the same fate.

Very simple game that is more abstract than tug of war. Very dark and muddy artwork. You try to re arrange the cards to get up the beanstalk and find the treasures. The Giant is working to get the FEEFIFOFUM cards to a certain position. Depending on how the cards fall in the set up the game can be fairly quick. Some interesting choices but mostly a game that didn't entice me to play again, even after losing the first game.

This is one of the best strict two players games I've had the good fortune to stumble across. the rules are simple and easy to learn. the gameplay is both basic and complex. i say its basic because there aren't many actions to choose from each turn (minutes to learn), but the ever changing board (cards) provides deep and complex strategic play. 

I've played this game countless times and have enjoyed it every time. best part is that it can be carried/played almost anywhere

This is a fantastic asymmetrical game. I'm very excited to try to get more plays of this game. The strategies of Jack and the giant are so different that it gives extra replayability by switching up the role you play. I'm interested to see if my findings show that it is as balanced as the designers say it is. A lot of people claim it isn't, but then they each list the other role as being the one that's overpowered.

Hard to recall my first play experience from this but it felt like my moves (as the Giant) were mostly arbitrary. This can certainly use more plays to discover what subtleties there are to playing each side. I just have little motivation to do so.

It’s rare for a small card game to pull off its theme especially well – [thing=619][/thing] comes to mind, although The Blood of an Englishman is pretty close too. In this game of perfect information, two players take on the respective roles of Jack and the Giant, with asymmetrical abilities and objectives to match. Jack’s goal is to complete three beanstalks, while the Giant either needs to get the words “Fee Fi Fo Fum” into position, or otherwise prevent Jack from reaching his goal. 

What’s neat is how the theme is expressed in the game arc – Jack moves nimbly and has an easy time at the beginning. But as the castle stack dwindles, so do Jack’s options and the clumsy Giant’s massive swipes become increasingly potent. While I can’t comment on game balance, it feels as if Jack’s flexibility leads to his player doing the bulk of the heavy lifting. The giant’s role, on the other hand, feels a lot more reactionary. Still, this is an admirable design, although not one that I’d be anxious to play given my dismal track record in 2-player perfect information games.

2017: 8. More thoughts later, but love the asymetric gameplay, mechanics and theme are very well woven together!

An enjoyable two-player game. The working of Jack is the easiest to do, the working of the Giant... takes a few plays to grasp what you might need to do to actually win. I recommend a non-gamer play Jack and a gamer play the Giant at first, if that is who you are playing with. Plays quick, quicker than the box says.

A race to thwart the other guy.  A fun game.  I don't see the game as being unbalanced ... I lose as Jack and I lose as The Giant.  Ha.

Great two-player assymetric game.  I played Jack in my first play through, and the mechanics fit the theme very well.  The game is a little faster than what I normally like, but regardless, it's like a quick game of chess in the ways of planning out several moves ahead and planning out what cards to move where.  Brilliant game!

Playing as 'Jack', this game reminded me, not unfavorably, of Parade, and there certainly was a feeling of having to 'dash up' the beanstalk to beat the Giant's win conditions. Artwork is fantastic even if the theme is unneeded (but thankfully unique).

Theme is incorporated nicely into such a quick playing game. Very good mechanics and player-specific win conditions make this a solid pickup. Game seems unbalanced in favor of one side the first few play-throughs, but quickly evens out as experience is gained.

The card manipulation thing looks like fun. Also, since I haven't read the story this is based on, "Fee Fi Fo Fum" sounds funny to me.

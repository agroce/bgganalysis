Combines tile-laying with a very good bluffing component, resulting in silly fun.  Decent for 2, much better for 3-4 players.  A good "gateway" game, very light, and actually quite language independent, provided you print off a copy of the rules in English.

An interesting game where you make walls/roads/rivers by laying tiles. You try to destroy other people's buildings while keeping your own in tact, the twist being that everyone's building type is secret until the end of the game. The theme and back story is absolutely zany and nonsensical, but funny. :p

I can only take so many advance-the-cause-of-your-secret-identity games; with Familienbande in my collection, I don't really feel the need for another. (The shortness of the game and the fun of building the family tree in that game outweighs any concern I have about unfairness/lack-of-subtlety-in-my-play.) Still, once it started, this was playable enough.

That may be the most hyphens I've ever used in one comment.

Odd game with an odd theme.  the game plays out will many similar aspects to a connection game, but with no clear objective of where you are going.  Amusing the first time it is played, the game on its own over time is not all that gripping.  Has a definite feel of an early design when the hobby explosion of the 90s took place,

A simple, light game that you have little control over. Basically, you are trying to divert the city growth away from your establishments which wouldn't be difficult, but you have three other people trying to cover your territory up.

Everyone talks about how the Spiel des Jahres is a huge factor in the gaming industry.  They say that games which attain that title are bound for greatness (at least in sales figures.)  So I found it very strange that a game which won the SdJ in 1991 took almost 20 years to reach the American market.  But, in general, SdJ winners have gone over very well with my family, so I knew it needed to be added to my collection ASAP.  When I read the rules I had really high hopes for the game too, because of the wacky theme and one of my favorite mechanisms (hidden goals.)

Unfortunately this game just didn't light my world on fire.  It is OK, but there doesn't seem to be anything really special or unique about the game that makes me want to play it again.  Perhaps with some more plays I'll understand more of the strategies, but upon the first play it seemed really difficult to have much control over what buildings get covered.  The voting almost seems like a sideshow that doesn't really give the players enough power to change what others are doing.  I'll try the game some more, but I'm really not expecting much.  The game is just kind of meh, nothing great and nothing awful.

One of the earliest games in the German genre I remember playing. Played it a lot an dloved it as a two player game. Since then have come to see it as a nice and simple intersting game but not so wildly thrilling or challenging. A load of luck involved basically, but a very nice threme and graphic and easy to introduce people to, with a reasonable amount of tension behind the luck elemnt. In its own way this has parallels to Ticket to Ride.

RATING: 6.5
[After 1 play] Slightly dated, but still enjoable.

Interesting is that players start with random assortment of tiles, which create fun asymmetry - some will have more tiles to expand river, some will have more tiles for building walls, so they have different impact on different parts of the board. 
Unfortunately, it sometimes cause you to be at mercy of your opponents, and it seems like frequently there is nothing to be done to prevent major loss of points.

Still, there are moments when you can do some sneaky and clever moves, and secret goals of opponents are not easy to deduce.

It is impressive, given age of this game and simple rules, that designer was able to cram it with asymmetric starting conditions, bluffing, negotiations and subtle subterfuge.

Works okay as a light family game, not so well with strategy gamers.  The biggest problem is that you start with a set number of points, with no way to gain points back - so if you lose a couple of buildings early, you can be shut out from any chance of a comeback with lots of playing time left (especially if a corner of the board gets cut off so that some buildings are safe).

It took us awhile to understand this game since we weren't very familiar with tile laying games in general.  Although we struggled with the rulebook, now that we already know the rules, playing the game is really not complicated.  (You also need the bgg clarification of the voting rules.)  We usually play with two players.  With two, it's difficult not to give away which color you are and still succeed.  Also, the voting doesn't work very well.  The game is better with four players.  With four, you don't even have to guess the other players' secret colors; you can just focus on making sure your color is doing best.  We have never played with 3.

D&D is an older, slightly more obscure title by Siedler designer Klaus Teuber. Like his more well-known game, it's an accessible game with a significant amount of player interaction.

D&D is at tile-laying game where players each have a set of 5 spaces that they don't want to see covered. What tiles a player will score from are hidden information though, so the game revolves around inducing which ones belong to each player while concealing your own.

Information of that sort can be revealed in two ways. First, and most obviously, by the tile placement decisions that a player is making, in other words, which spaces they are leaving exposed to future players, or even which spaces they are directly covering. The other way is through the odd voting system. In short, a number of spaces have outhouses on them, which are apparently community property. Anytime an outhouse is covered, there's a vote about whether that move will be allowed, and players can support or object with 3 levels of seriousness.

The game is fast playing with a good light atmosphere, and the bluff/counter-bluff elements are enjoyable. It seems like a good game to play with non-gamers as well as it is simple enough to teach quickly, but has enough to chew on to satisfy more hardened gamers.

Very fun. The hidden roles become pretty clear by the end of the game, but it's fun deducing them (for those like that sort of thing, such as in games like Clans, etc). You're effectiving trying to prevent your buildings from getting wiped out while wiping out others' buildings. The voting on whether to wipe out an outhouse, as opposed to actual buildings that score, is a nice touch. Simple to teach and play. It is susceptible to group thing and table talk, which sas a tendency to slow the game down at the end.

RATING: 6.3
This SdJ winner has a nutty ruleset - the townsfolk are trying to expand various roads through town, but for some reason they refuse to mow down outhouses, while they knock down schools with reckless abandon!

Using tiles representing railroads, waterways and dirt roads, players continue routes across the small board.  Their goal is to avoid a particular building type drawn by a random card at the start of the game (like banks or saloons).  Each time an outhouse is going to be covered, players use their secret vote cards - but they don't get those cards back, so they must be used wisely.

This game doesn't seem like it should work, but it was surprisingly silly fun with 4 players.  Not a game I need to own, but I'd play it again.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Components: Good tiles with interesting artwork; they look a bit busy when all in play, but the three road types are easy to differentiate, as are the building themes. I wouldn't mind if there were some mechanism allowing me to quickly see which buildings had been covered, rather than hunt all around the board adding up what's left.

Experience: I've only played this as a two-player game, and have enjoyed it as such. There's quite a bit of bluff, and double-think, as well as budgeting my tiles and voting cards. Still, I think this would be better with more players.

Early German game where players own a set of buildings already on the map, and must build the road, river and wall network.

RATING: 6
Very old-school German-style game which still has some charm.   Four "snakes" emerge from corners of the board, and players play tiles to grow each snake.  The idea is to cover over other players buildings, where each player has a secret type of building that only scores for them.   The catch is that outhouses (which belong to nobody) must be voted upon if they are covered.   Each player has a fixed hand of voting cards.  So there is some deduction happening as you seek to figure out who cares about which building type, but it's not that hard to figure out (unless Aaron double-bluffs you).   Simple and plays quickly.  Good family game.

A remake/redesign of Drunter & Druber, a 1991 Spiel des Jahres winner.

I think we must have played incorrectly! With 3 players, left with only 1, 1-pt. building standing.  Can this be?  Seems broken.  Must have done something wrong.  

I very much appreciated the humor & theme of this game.

Interesting game bogged down by shoddy artwork which takes a lot out of the experience.  There are familiar options like tile-laying and secret objectives but nothing really shines through, or enough so to live up to its SdJ status.

I enjoyed this tile laying game. It felt a bit like Metro with a western theme.

Not bad, but my guess is that Mayfair published this as a favor to one of its favorite designers. It just doesn't add much to the list of games out there. I hoped to buy it for my kids, but there's a bit too much of "screw your neighbor" in the gameplay for it to be a good choice for my kids (who get pretty upset at that).

Another game I wouldn't buy but that I would play any time if asked.

Bem divertido. O jogo se passa em uma vila que tem várias construções de diferentes cores. Nós recebemos um objetivo que é preservar o maior número possível de construções de uma determinada cor. Nessa vila devemos construir (colocação de tiles) muralhas, ruas e rios. Para tal podemos destruir construções de qualquer cor mas, espalhados pelo mapa, tem banheiros que para serem derrubados devem, através de uma votação que possibilita blefe, ter o consentimento dos jogadores. Divertido, especialmente, quando sacanearmos os outros e facilitamos a destruição de suas construções.

Add this one to the Top Secret Spies and other Clans: another game where nobody knows your color, and you should try to keep the secret as long as you can. Now, this basic mechanic (beaten to death, some would say) works impressively well in such a simple tile-laying and movement game. DuD is quick, somewhat chaotic, but it's a little bit meatier than Top Secret Spies and less cerebral than Clans.

Drunter und Drüber is very light fare for the family, although, suprisingly for an SdJ, there is a fair amount of take that as well, which may not appeal too much to that demographic. There are a few tactical decisions to make, like what and where to build, trying to lead paths into dead-ends, and of course the secret bidding when building over the toilet stalls (yeah, really) but overall it's a pretty one-dimensional affair: Run over as many enemy buildings as possible while keeping the roads away from yours. The initial tile distribution can almost play the game for you if you're unlucky.

Woah, I really didn't like this one. It's not that I found it boring or something, but it is quite unkind. The decisions one has to make are not simple and the voting mechanism is cool. But I couldn't stand that one's goal is to take points away from the others. Usually in other games you either destroy the enemy units or they will destroy yours. Here nothing bad would happen to you if you would leave the opponents alone. They only have a few nice looking buildings and your job is to hunt them down one-by-one and to destroy them. Socially this game can definitely ruin an evening.

Interesting game of tile laying, deduction, and screwing your neighbor. Players keep their interests secret, while trying to eliminate other people's property.  I agree with the parallels between this and Tron's light cycles.  It's sort of a marriage between that, Carcassone, and Heimlich & Co. A Teuber SDJ award winner, before Settlers even was a concept.

This is quite a simple and fun little game for what it is. Would be good for families and children and the adults won't mind playing, as the game plays pretty quick.

It's a decent game of bluffing and trying to cover up your opponents buildings, befoer they do so to you, but the trick is that nobody knows who has what colors.

Players are laying tiles of road, track and water to make continuous paths, in order to work their way to covering up the other players buildings, but when someone tries to build over an outhouse, the players all vote and tally them up, to see if it's allowed or not. As the game goes on, you get a pretty good idea of who has what colors and then you hope you're right and go out to build over them.

The game is light and easy to learn/teach and plays quick. Not something I'd play all of the time, but it was fun for what it was and would be good for the family type play or something light every now and then.

RATING: 5
The avalanche of republications continues.  One of the latest is Wacky Wacky West, a reprint of the 1991 Spiel des Jahre winner Drunter und Drüber by Klaus Teuber.  This new edition by Mayfair Games changes the artwork and title -- neither an improvement -- but as far as I can remember, the rules and game play remain identical to the original.  It is the first time an English version has been made available, but I can’t help but asking "Why bother?"

The game sounds more interesting than it really is. At best, the game is average. The voting is not really as dramatic or tense as one would think. Also, it is quite possible that one player will be stuck with an abundance of one type of infrastructure, which will greatly hinder his placement options during the game.  While there are some opportunities to steer a route away from a particular building, this usually can be altered by the play of your opponents.  Plus, you are hostage to the tiles you possess.  There really isn't a whole lot of control here ... nor excitement.  I didn’t particularly care for Drunter und Drüber, and there have been no improvements or changes made with this latest edition.   Indeed, the artwork on the components is worse, particularly the roads.  It is often difficult to spot the tiny person that indicates the start edge of a tile.  

After playing the game again after the passage of a considerable amount of time, I can appreciate just how far game design has improved.  That’s not to say the game is bad; it isn’t.  However, it feels dated and bland.  It would still likely entertain families who don’t regularly play games, but the more discerning gamer will likely be disappointed.

Crazy little tile laying game where your scoring role is hidden and you vote for where some of the tiles go.  The bluffing is well done, as is the secret votes.  Occasionally there will be an interesting decision with the tiles, but usually that part of the game is fairly obvious.

Its pretty fun until late when you realize who is who, look around, and can't do anything!  

A good game but not great.  Apparently there is a variant which improves it some.

RATING: 6
Another short and fun game from Mr. Teuber that is perfectly suited for a good gateway game for occasional play.

The play is similiar to 'Clans' in that you are trying to keep your color hidden throughout the game while building over other people making it tricky to bluff and fun as well. A little strategy comes in through the tile placement and even the voting (which is when a tile gets placed on a toilet!) but it is a very light, quick and fun game where you have limited control so best played for the quick and fun aspect. Simple to learn and scales 2 - 4 great.

Haven't played it for a few years, but nicely balanced town-building game. Each player secretly tries to support a group of buildings without letting the other players know which group - because when they do, they'll try to build roads over them! It's a trade off between showing your hand early to support your buildings and playing your hand close to your chest - make your intentions clear early on and you set yourself up as a target, but there comes a point where you have to defend what's yours when it's under threat.

The game board is a grid with different buildings printed on some of the squares. Each type of building has a range of values from 1-5. Players play road/rail/river tiles to extend paths over other buildings while protecting the building type on their secret goal cards. At the end of the game, the player with the most points in uncovered buildings wins. Outhouse spaces are blockers, and players expend voting cards to determine if a tile is placed over them or not.

Simple game and nicely interactive. The length of play at about 40 minutes is just right. Very good family game, with just a skootch of conflict. Choices get extremely limited at game's end, but given the game's lightness it isn't a big issue. Mayfair may have blown a great opportunity by hanging a lousy, off-putting noose of a name around the neck of this reprint. They do WANT to sell games, don't they?

The theme is amusing, and the game is easy to learn and play.  It is a little mean, as any game where you destroy other people's stuff (kind of like Elasund, I guess - here you're also building over other people's buildings), but here it doesn't matter, because the building backers' identities are supposedly secret.  It's still pretty easy to tell, especially when you see someone desperately trying to save a building.  But I enjoy the hidden owner mechanic.  The tiles don't come together as nicely as say, Carcassonne, where you end up with a cool-looking landscape, but the game plays quickly enough that I classify it in my mind as almost a filler.

Traded away.

A fairly pleasant and brief tile-layer where misdirection is of the highest importance. And on occasion, temporary emergent alliances... or so you may think. Two notes: 1) The variant game seems much more arbitrary than the basic game: moves will be less committed and less indicative throughout, and likely the winner will be whoever holds a potential high-scorer and doesn't get hosed enough by the communal effort to rein in potential high-scorers. 2) The stupid insert won't let you take the game anywhere without mixing the components up in the box. Who designs inserts like that?

[LUP 29-Jul-2007] Melissa got this as part of her Secret Santa in 2005.  A good medium weight game, we have played it with Daughter the Elder a few times and she likes it too.

4 plays.  Twice in 2002, and twice in one night in 2015.  The second play in 2015 was with the variant rules included in the game.

While the base game is cute, the voting adds a fair bit of chaos to an already chaotic game.  The variant rules do away with the voting, and change the game to a more straightforward map making game.

I'd play either way, but see a bit more merit in the variant rules.  Both games have some end game considerations that belie the perception that is is a piece of fluff.

Each player gets a number of tiles and a secret card of a building type they have to protect. On your turn lay a tile on the board (Wall, Canal or Road) and preferably over someone elses building which destroys it. Voting takes place only when a toilet is demolished in which case a building by co-incidence may also be saved. Beware though, as soon as someone guesses your building type all players will go out of their way to destroy them all.
Play without the special cards, they are not needed to have fun with this game. never had a bad game yet - even when I have no buildings left.

A game about toilet preservation.  It's kind of fun for that reason alone.

One important rule obmission in the English translation is that of ties.  This is how my group plays and it works quite well.  

If at least one person plays a vote card (JA or NE or NEEIN) the tile is removed.

If everybody abstained from bidding with their ?? card the tile stays.

Enjoy the game.  Lots of fun and a great pick by the SdJ jury.

Klaus Teuber's game where one has secret buildings worth points on the board.  Theme is building roadways/rivers/green areas through a town (and destroying buildings), but outhouses cause a detour. Voting mechanic amongst players to determine if detours are allowed. Seems like a lack of control, since if opponents are intent on wiping out a building, they can.

First impression (4 players) : A connection/building game with secret goal for each player. You try to build over your opponent's buildings and save your own. Building is limited to pieces you're dealt in setup and there are three different things to be built (walls, road and river). Building can only be continued from the "end" of the route but every player can play any of the three types assuming they have right piece. You can freely place pieces unless you're trying to put in over outhouse in which case players will vote if the piece will go there or not.

I liked how you can plan strategically depending on pieces you have but there is still lot of luck/chaos so it's a good family game. For me personally I liked this far more than I thought I would because in general I dislike "secret goal" as a mechanic.

RATING: 7
Klaus Teuber finished his triumphant run of three Spiel des Jahres awards in four years with this humourous positional game where players have got to preserve their buildings printed on the board from being covered by tiles, i.e. demolished in order to build the city walls, a street and a river (very silly indeed). These are started from the corners of the board, and are thus extended more often than not towards the middle (where the most precious buildings have got to be demolished). You get the picture of the finished town... 

Nonetheless, it's not just about tile-laying and not losing points (as opposed to "winning them") - there are toilets as well, and they can't be destroyed without voting (ehem). This is achieved bidding secretly with cards, which can support the demolition with different degrees of enthusiasm (JA, JAA! and JAAA!! cards), reject it (NEIN, NEEIN! and NEEEIN!! cards), both (JEEIIN!! card) or none (? card). All but the last card get wasted in the process, so they need to be managed with care.

Drunter und Drüber is hilarious when played by four. Not too deep but interesting nearly all the way through (sometimes bits of the board are enclosed so that players can only wait for their buildings to fall... unless they can waste their tiles somewhere else and hope for the other players' tiles to run out early enough). Even though the game doesn't involve a wide range of points and therefore there might be a draw here and there, its relatively short duration and brisk pace enable one or even several replays.

RATING: N/A
Each player begins with a secret building objective. During the game players will be adding roads, waterways and bridges that will potentially cover up buildings along the way. The board is set up with pictures of different buildings scattered across the board. As the roadways, etc. are built they will threaten nearby buildings. Each player has voting cards, so that when a new construction would cover an outhouse, this is the chance to say yes or no to this construction. After all, you might not want the new construction because it is really close to one of your buildings. A pretty fun game that is medium light and quick to play.

I had a lot of success with this one with non-gamers back in the day, calling it a stomping game and hamming it up to get people in the mood. I mean, what can't be fun about voting to demolish toilets! No feelings can be hurt as colours aren't known, and people get to build and demolish in the same breath. It’s all over in 20-30 minutes, first timers can win; it's the perfect length for what it is. Watching the tile placement steer-aways (from a colour) and the voting patterns (whether someone votes against steering towards a certain colour) gives fuel for the talk-it-up, and licence to bluff until you *really* need to steer a trail away. So to me, it’s never felt random; I’ve usually known everyone’s colours by the end of the game. Most importantly, the “stomping” has made it fun doing so. It hasn’t come out in a long time though so it’s probably fair to say it hasn’t stood the test of time.

You have little control over how things will turn out once all 4 paths have reached impass. Lots of randomness with little strategy and tactics.
The only strategies are to try to balance your tile holdings so as to retain some of each type in order to remain flexible, and pretty much when you can, just play tiles to steer the paths away from your desired spots and hope for the best.

As with many SdJ winners, this a relatively light, relatively quick, entertaining family game.  The random hand of tiles as well as random assignment of buildings to protect keeps the game different.  While this can be played (and enjoyed) as a game with little thought, there is actually plenty of opportunity for skillful.  Because of this, there can be a tendency for over-analysis.  Another aspect is the opportunity for negative play towards others once you have figured out what their target building is.  Still, for us, it is plenty quick enough and pleasant enough to play with the girls.  Always a good thing in my book. [01/18/2009]

RATING: 6
So it's an SdJ winner. Big deal. It's an amusing light tile laying game. Players have a certain sort of building they secretly wish to preserve. They have a tile supply of varying lengths and seek to place tiles over other buildings.

The fun comes in second guessing what the other players secret buildings are. Then comes the vote cards. When a player places a tile over a toilet, players have a series of Yes, No, don't care and break the vote cards. These are used to decide whether to allow a tile to be built over a toilet.

Plays fairly fast with very slight strategic value.

A vicious little game which depends partly on the luck of the draw of the tiles, but then becomes a game of bluff, counter-bluff and pure vindictiveness as you try to destroy everybody else's buildings without giving them the chance to destroy you.

This is a very entertaining SDJ winner.  Each player has a secret color of buildings that he is trying to protect.

Klaus Teuber (Catan); A long time ago, in a village far, far away, some disturbed townsfolk decided to destroy their entire town in order to rid themselves of an evil menace (it's technically a dog-mouse, but I think it's an idiomatic thing). Anyway, so the villagers rebuilt all the buildings in the town (including their precious outhouses), but forgot to include city walls, a river, or roads. To rectify this, players lay tiles with one of these three things onto the board, and any building caught underneath them is automatically eliminated, except for outhouses. When an outhouse would be destroyed, players take a vote on whether to place that particular section. Each player is trying to retain the most of one type of building, and once all the pieces have been placed the winner is the person with the highest valued buildings still standing.

Finally I was able to test this. The age is starting to show, but actually it wasn't too bad. Who comes up with themes like in this game?

Game is good. rules for WACKY WACKY WEST are black printed on brown? Designer made poor choices, it's tough to read in anything other than perfect light. Print out rules file here on BGG for an easier read.

Gespeeld tijdens spiel 2011. Een spel gemaakt door Klaus Teuber voordat hij wereldberoemd werd met Kolonisten van Catan.

In Wacky Wacky West zijn de spelers inwoners van een dorpje die hun dorp opnieuw inrichten door er spoorlijnen, wegen en beekjes doorheen te leggen. Echter betekent dit ook dat er zo af en toe gebouwen moeten sneuvelen. Iedere speler beheert één soort gebouw en probeert deze te redden van de ondergang. Je wint als je nog de meeste waarde aan gebouwen over hebt.

Dit spel speelt makkelijk weg, maar kan voor een onfortuinlijke speler ook zomaar afgelopen zijn binnen een paar beurten als zijn meest waardevolle gebouwen meteen worden gesloopt. Hierdoor is het spel voor mij geen echte hoogvlieger, maar wel grappig.

Drunter & Druber. A decent filler which reminded me a little of Blokus meets Heimlich & Co. It's a tile-laying, route-making game with secret player colours and occasional voting on tile placement. The aim is to have your coloured spaces visible at the end of the game, while using your placements to cover up other coloured spots. I enjoyed it and think it's worth playing as a lighter filler. The art is horrible, in the cartoony old-school German style (see also Um Reifenbreite).

Great fun with a cutthroat crowd.

The best game when your looking for a combination of: quick play, easy rules, no accounting, destroying your enemy, and bluffing on your agenda -- yet very subtle.  If you don't find this intense and cutthroat then your not playing it right (Playing this game wrong is like playing poker where everyone antees and then just turns over their cards).  i.e. Look at the mind-game/bluffing/negotiating aspect when you play -- not just the rules.

I always forget about this game. Truth is, it's not bad. Tile laying, trying to keep your secret buildings from being built over. It does seem to be more frustrating than fun though.

RATING: 7
I'm starting to dig this game. Some elements of random luck, but that's excusable for a kids game. Just the right amount of strategy, although my 4 & 5 don't get it yet. Good for them to sit down for 15 min to learn playing and concentration skills.

Rating as a kid's game. Light and easy path game where you play colored cards to move your owls. The movement works like Candyland (or Cartagena for the adults) but you're cooperatively moving your family of owls to their nest and you pick a card from a hand of cards rather than playing one randomly. Great for kids in the 4-6 range. Excellent art and components.

What an undervalued kids game.  Must have.  Cooperative, uses color navigation, but as kids get older they begin to see the strategy.  Company uses high quality material and environmentally friendly.  If you have kids, get this game!  One of our favorite kids games.

Very nice cooperative game for kids which is certainly miles ahead of Candyland.  Also has overtones of Cartagena (which I love).  There's still quite a bit of luck involved - in our two games, the suns seemed to gather at the top of the deck - but overall, this is a nice twist on the above-mentioned two games.

Rated for playing with young kids.

An excellent game to start teaching more complex game mechanics to young kids. The board is colorful, the design is nice, and everything is made from recycled materials.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Attractive components, simple rules and fun theme make this a solid young kids game. It has room for growth in the appreciation of complexity and strategy. Very young kids (my daughter was 3 when I bought the game for her) can enjoy just moving the owls to the nest, while slightly older kids may pick up on some of the strategy in card/color selection. I appreciate the cooperative vs. competitive aspect as a an experiential lesson in values as well.

I'm giving this a numerical rating as a kids game. As a game for adults, of course, it's rather insipid.

Initial rating based on about 2-3 plays.  I like this game but my 4.5-year-old doesn't really seem to get into it.  We made fun little owls out of clay to replace the cardboard counters (she's not into counters but likes more tactile 3D things), which helped, but I think we need to wait until she's a little older to understand the neat strategy involved in choosing which color/piece to advance.

Rating as a young kids' game. Good for ages 3+. My favorite of the Peaceable Kingdom games we've tried. Skipping mechanism encourages planning ahead and cooperation. Nice to be able to vary the length and difficulty by selecting the number of starting owls.

My only complaint is that the sun token should be a bit bigger. It's prone to getting lost.

Cartagena makes a nice follow on; it has a similar skipping mechanism.

The three-year-old I was playing with was making such terrible decisions I had no choice but to accuse her of being the traitor.

"I'm not the traitor," she screamed, "[i]You're[/i] the traitor!"

I was most assuredly [i]not[/i], doing my utmost to get the wee baby owls back home.

Of course, due to her lackluster efforts we did not prevail and so most of them perished.  (They die, right?  The sun hits them and they explode like vampires.  That's what I told the kid, anyway.)

Had a fun time playing this with the older kids (5-year old twins)...

HOH inserts the "move to the spot of this color" mechanic into a smarter euro game for kids.  I like that the game features scaleable difficulty.  

We have enjoyed using the maximum number of owls possible (6) in each game to make the challenge as great as the game allows.

So far, we have not won.  We have had a couple nail-biter finishes, however.  For a co-op game, that is exactly what I am looking for....

RATING: N/A
5 y/o daughter likes this game; girlfriend loves it. It's a good, quick, super-lite co-op you can play with the family. Making optimal moves is pretty easy to learn, so you really need to be playing the game on "hard" difficulty for it to be much of a challenge. Has a "skip your turn" mechanic that I'm not a fan of, but the turns move by really fast, so it's not a huge deal. It seems like the bones are there for a potentially more challenging game you could create via houserules.

A very solid way to introduce kids to gaming.  So much better than the mass market games out for small kids (ie Candyland and Chutes and Ladders)!  I love the fact that it is cooperative in nature.  No need to struggle with issue of how much you should "let" you kids win.

[My rating is for kids] 
Ages 4+. Fun, light, co-operative game for kids that adults can also play. 

The basic mechanic is like Cartagena by Leo Colovini. You play cards of different colors, and move a game piece to the next space of that color on the board - it that space is occupied, then you get to move to the next space of that color. In this way you can leap far down the board. This obviously creates some strategy, and some discussion among the players. 

There is some luck involved - each time you draw a sun card, you move the sun closer to rising and ending the game. 

My 8 year old says this is her favorite among the new co-op games from the publisher Peaceable Kingdom.

RATING: 5.5
This is an extremely simple cooperative game. Which is good as we often don't have anything simple enough for kids workshops - cooperative games are a great tool for teaching social skills, but most of them are too complicated (and Escape is too expensive). 

Hoot Owl Hoot! is almost too simple, but hey, we just want to work together. And the owls look really cute. Kids I've played with got really emotionally invested in it ("damn it's the sun") but also proven that they can plan quite well. It's also a co-op I can throw before a child and a parent and leave them having fun on their own. 

[German edition of the game]

EDIT: playing it more. Dang, this is popular with kids as they actually can solve it and get a sense of achievement and smartness. Plus the owls in this edition are super cute.

A great alternative to Candyland--similar concepts (play a colored card to move a game token to the next space of that color), but moves MUCH faster and has a bit of strategy involved. After playing one game with me, my 5 year old daughter was able to explain the rules to my husband perfectly. The cooperative aspect is nice too.

This is a favorite kids game to play with our 5yr old, even our 2yr old can enjoy it (for about half a game, which is pretty remarkable to hold a 2yr old's attention that long). Unlike just about all other little kids games there actually is a decision to make: which owl to move? Being cooperative it does end with "who won?" and the kids aren't quite satisfied with "we all did". But it makes us parent types happy. :)

Rated as a young childrens' (6 and under game).  I think this is about as good as you can do for a preschool/early elementary game.  I just wish the components were a little more stout.  I think the cards and owls will wear out quickly.

Hoot Owl Hoot! is another one of my kids favorite game to play. For me it's meh, but it's great for kids. Not sure why my kids love this so much, but they do. It's very simple and requires lots of teamwork to get all the owl home before the sun rises.

This is a great kids game.  The rules are Candyland simple (choose a card and move to the next available space of that color) but the cooperative aspect of sharing all the owls and racing them to their nest before the sun rises adds a remarkable amount of fun.  I doubt I'll be finding many better games for younger kids.

Rating note: No... I really don't rank this equal to Agricola and Go... but it the best kids game I've found for pre-school aged children... and its fun for the parents they play with too!

I first played this in a 2 player game and find it unattractive and broken, plus I am new to the rules and the cards need time to get used to (the sea, year etc.) and confusing at times. So I rate it a 6 instead.

I got a chance to play the game a second time at A Gathering of Strangers (Utah con), this time with 6 players and the game shines, there is a lot of strategy to think about, like whether to help out to even the score and sweeten the pot for chance to win it the second time. This game is fun and I will play it again.

Rating increase from a 6 to an 8 after my second play with 6 players.

I didn't see the fun of this game at all, although I'm very interested in the topic. I have great difficulty to determine which cards can be played and I often mistake. You have to look at three things: year, ocean and type of combat. This is to fuzzy for me. Besides the convoys appear random and thus the cards to play. I only see very little tactics - mainly negotiation - and no strategy at all in this game.

Maybe the game would have been better if the convoys were played in a timeline; 1940 cards first and so on. This would add a lot more historicity and so you would know which cards to save and which can be discarded. The removal of the year restriction could also work well.

RATING: 4
The game is fine, one first play it just played far too long for what it is. Especially since, as there isn't a huge emphasis on hand management (though there's some of that), the turns are fairly independent of one another. To me, a game like this should be done in an hour, this took us more than 2. If I were to play again, I'd suggest no choice over convoys and keeping the earned VPs hidden to speed things up a bit.

I wish someone would reprint this game.  I love it and it is requested at my game group often, only two guys in the group have it and they are often chastised when they don't bring it.

I finally got it off of eBay...not too bad on price but heavily used.  No problem, I plan to continue the trend.

RATING: 5
Could be a moderate filler card game but has been hugely and needlessly over-complicated. Want to play that card? You can't because it is the wrong year, wrong background, has the wrong symbol, you are not standing on one leg and facing west.

There is a good game in there fighting to get out but as it stands it is just laughably awkward to play and hugely luck driven as a result (not got a 1940 Arctic card? Well you cant take part in this round).

Not a bad trick-taking game, although pretty plain-vanilla with gratuitous chrome. I liked it, kinda, but it certainly will not appeal to everyone. It's another one of these "wargamer euros", games that *could* have been euro-style games but where a gratuitously violent theme and persnickety chrome was added to appeal to the wargamer market. Must admit that I was stunned - stunned, I tell you! - to see that GMT thought that doing a new edition of this game (Pacific Typhoon) was a good idea.  UPDATE: Apparently it was *such* a good idea, MMP jumped on the bandwagon and are doing there own remake. I can only shake my head and wonder. Maybe I'll have to try the thing again after all.

I played this once at BGG.con, with 6p.  It was loads of fun. I pre-ordered Pacific Storm shortly after that, and have also enjoyed that game. 

Seems this one really needs 6 players to shine at its best. While technically playable with less, you start to lose some of the fun card interactions as well as the tug of war of the two military sides. 

I'm not sure who you play this game with, though. It appeals to wargamers thematically, but the game play is very card-gamey and too light for most wargamers. Playing it with a light-game group, and the theme seems weird. Not sure on that one. I need to find 5 other players like myself who want to play, I guess.

Avalon Hill.  Fun abstract WWII convoy combat card game.  This game places an emphasis on actual convoys in the war and various types of units that saw combat above, on or below the surface in the Atlantic and the frigid waters on the routes to Russia.  If you are looking for realism, this game is not for you as it is more like playing cards like Hearts or Spades with "tricks" to be taken.  Neat art work on the cards.

Complaints that this is a Bridge variant insult Bridge. Game hinges on if you have the *exact* card necessary to match up with a given ship/convoy, and there are a lot of cards. Three plays have left me thinking that perhaps this is a good time to sell.

Odd take on the trick-taking genre.  I think you need a number of players involved to get the numbers of cards needed to counter-act the big cards, but still a fun little game, IMHO.

A nice card trick collecting game with a good theme. A bit long for what it is, though I'm guessing that can depend on the players. Probably best played as a pickup game from time to time, not regular and repeated play.

I would always choose [i]Pacific Typhoon[/i] over this game, however, because it has greater depth without significantly increasing the playing time.

Too long for what it is, too random for how long it is, huge slices of luck, a rich-get-richer aspect and despite a great theme, the game displays thematic dissonance in the form of the players contribute to both the Axis and the Allies - who/what actually are you.

Was looking forward to playing this but very disappointed.

I'm not really into these types of card games where memorizing the deck and knowing what card defeats which other card will earn you victory. That said, this is a pretty interesting one.

My memories of this game are extraordinarily negative - combining the randomness of the cards with the negotiation element didn't work for me. (I felt the same way about the Alea game about the 7 wizards.)

There's a new version which some in my group really like - I probably ought to give it another try.

Family gamers will be turned off by the war theme; wargamers will be turned off by the lack of hexes, chits, blocks, and minis.

Can't call it a wargame, but it is chock full of history; playing it aroused my curiosity of the Atlantic war. Great for five or six players whose interaction will make it fun. And you do need to be able to talk your s**t. Toward the end of a round or trick play may slow down a little as players try to figure out the odds of success upon playing a certain card but that hasn't spoiled the game for me. My Tuesday Night Reg'lars enjoy it, I have sleeved the cards to protect them, and am quite willing to play it if I can't set up a genuine wargame.

I'm not a big trick taking game fan.  While Atlantic Storm layers on the theme and adds lots of flavor rules, it still ends up being little more than your standard trick taking game (except with new added chaos!).  The ship interaction seemed pointless to me and most of the flavor rules just limit your options for cardplay.  I'll admit most of my dislike for this game comes from the genre, but I see little here.  Boring.

Pretty decent game. Will have to play more to get a better grasp as the cards are many and have specific interactions with other cards.

One thing I disliked was that there were too many crapy cards that had no use... those should be replaced with cards that are good with just one type of attack (submarine, surface, or air) or a couple more super powerful cards (5s or 6s).

RATING: 10
Great game combining trick taking card play with a WW2 "Battle of the Atlantic" theme.  Playable with two or three but the game really begins to shine with four or more players.  New players can be confused (and even frustrated) with all the variables that must be considered when determining what card to play or discard.  This learning curve is overcome after a game or two and is well worth the effort.

Excellent game with great graphics!  Although the rules prescribe playing mixed Allied/Axis hands, our group always plays this as a 4 player game with two Allied and two German players.  After the game is done, we switch sides and add up the scores when we are done. 
I must have played this over 100 times and finally got card covers in early 2008!
As a footnote, I played it at the 2007 WBC and finished last at a table of 5 players.  Afterwards I found out that that two previous champions and a co-designer of the game were at the table.

Although technically a trick-taking game, this is unlike almost all card games of its type because of the negotiation that goes on across the table.  Further play has convinced me that this is an excellent game.

RATING: 8
If I won more often, it'd be a 9...

Seriously, my one 'gripe' with the game is the fact that it's WAY too easy to identify the leader and then, bash him - even when it carries NO benefit to the other players (i.e., leader on one side, 2 others on the other, and the 4th player goes - plays wih the other side, and gets NO spoils (only 2 to be had - convoy and leader card) - had he helped the leader, he'd have gotten at least one).

I can't explain why, but I and most in my group really enjoy this game.  I think that the combination of elements (Axis vs. Allied, air vs. surface vs. submerged, etc.) along with the table talk and the dividing up of the booty just makes it click with the group.  I can see why many don't like it, but this comes out often in my group.

A good game, and I do emphasize the word game.  It's not a conflict simulation in any meaningful sense.

I have taught this game to quite a number of gamers... not one person didn't want to play it again.  An abstract simulation of WWII Atlantic and Arctic navel warfare revolving around convoys.  Card game with historical ships, planes, subs and convoys with special cards that can add bonuses or change the game play.  Players choose to defend or attack the convoy, usually based on the cards in hand.  Certain cards are "fated" and are destroyed... Do you play the Hood and hope someone doesn't play after you and plop down the Bismark?  Lots of fun, games are usually pretty close.  Game time is usually about 1.5 hours with 5 people.

This sounds like an interesting card game.  It plays kind of long for a card game at ~1hr.

Each turn there is a cargo ship flipped over and players either support or attack the ship.  The player contributing the most decides how the spoils are distributed.

There are a couple of rules to spice it up. This game is gettable for theme, simplicity of rules but depth of play, and player interaction/negotiation.

Certainly gets much better with more players.  Choosing a 1940 convoy because you have a playable card in your hand, or leading off with an admiral, two battleships, and bonus cards, or going arctic just to get that damn card out of your hand...

RATING: 6
Based on WW II naval combat, on each turn a convoy card is flipped up. Players on thier turn play an axis or ally card to determine whether you are attacking or defending the convoy. Biggest contributor to the winning side gets to distribute spoils of victory according to certain rules. Widely varying cards inject too much luck, and the historical impacts are put in the rules, but still fun to play on occasion. Also, the distribution of the spoils of victory is usually not fair.

A fun multiplayer card game. Has been a consistent request as a fill in game for the last 12 years.

'Pacific Typhon' uses the same game system and is currently in print. Worth a look if you get a chance.

Like it better than "Naval War" at times.  Try finding it on eBay and pay about $100.00 for it!  LOL

OK two-player, should be fabulous multiplayer with team rules (from Pacific Typhoon?).  Don't like vanilla version because of the thematic oddity of playing both sides....  Traded.

An interesting card game with great thematic integration.  You are a WW2 power that wants control over a supply convoy, and which card you play determines whether you're on the Allied or Axis team for that round.  If you're on the winning team, you gain points according to the convoy and the defeated units.  However, the points are distributed by whoever had the largest unit, causing a lot of griping about who's in the lead and where the points should go, which I didn't find appealing.  Also, there's a lot of variations in the cards, so you might find yourself stuck without the right card for a given situation, depending on your luck.

This is an excellent, very fun game, and I am somewhat surprised at some of the negative comments I have seen here.  I have had a tremendous amount of fun playing this game, esp. with 5 players, and I have seen it be very popular at gaming tournaments.  The physical quality of the game is also very high.

This is a great little game, nice and quick playing, and a lot of fun.  The only drawback is the huge luck factor.  Some pretty cool historical chrome, though; I particularly like the &quot;victims of fate&quot; feature.

RATING: 7
A fast, fun game based around the Battle of the Atlantic in WWII.  Each round players either attack (as the Germans) or defend (as the Allies) the current convoy in play.  A clever, enjoyable game with plenty of opportunities for backstabbing for the devious to enjoy.

Not a wargame, but really weird trick taking cardgame with ships and planes on it.  Each player can decide on each trick...I meant convoy, to play on either the Allies or Axis side.  (What this is attempting to simulate is anyone's guess!)   After the trik-onvoy, the player who played the best card on the winning side divides the spoils (i.e. The "convoy card" plus all cards played on the losing side.)  

It degenerates into a game of petty negotiation of offering larger slices of the spoils to the players who go last ("If you help me win as the Allies, I'll give you a bigger prize.....")

YUCK!

A non-serious game about U-boat warfare. The game was a little too simple for my tastes (and thus boring), but with four players the game proved to be more fun. Less than or more than four players, the game didn't seem to hold up well.

At least it isn't Dominion.  Lots of luck - essentially if you don't get the right cards, you aren't winning.  I like luck, but this is a little to much for me.  If you're into the WWII theme, I'm sure you will appreciate this card game a lot more than I did.  It was ok, but there are MANY other games I would play before this one.

RATING: 6
A trick-taking game that's almost 'Top Trumps' like in nature. Players have a hand of cards with varying values. These are played against convoys (worth VPs). The lead player determines that type of engagement (sub, surface or air) and once all players have played a card or discarded, the highest value wins. There are bonus cards for modifiers and die rolling. Not a bad little game. Feels almost like a kid's game...(in a good way).

Trick-taking card game of naval war in the Atlantic, 1939-1944.  Players fight for convoy cards, choosing an air/sea/sub battle (or combined), and then trying to play the highest cards of the battle type.  Winner takes the convoy.

My frustration with this game was the lack of being able to refresh your hand once you had a handfull of stinkers.  One card at a time was not enough to allow me to dig out of the hole I was in, I was hesitant to just throw a card out there to give someone else more points at the end.

There are other games I would rather play.,

This is a great multiplayer trick-taking game as long as players remember to talk to each other. Beg, plead, and threaten others to take your side and it's a lot of fun. Played silently or with the wrong crowd, and it probably won't go over too well.

A nice card driven war game.  I enjoyed the historical aspect of this and the attention to detail.  I'm not a big wargamer and certainly not a history buff.  I found the details and the gameplay interesting and might play this or other games like it from time to time, but it's not generally "my kind of game"

I love this game! Easy to learn, fun to play great art and history on the cards teaches you about the battle for the Atlantic as you play.Once everyone is up to speed you can finish a game in an hour. Fairly well balanced as it is rare for someone to win by a landslide (although it happens on rare occasions). One of the best card games I have ever played. Highly recommended!

I watched a demo of this at WBC 2005.  A thought the game was Atlantic Star (aka Showmanager), not Storm...  :p  Well, it was a happy mistake because it looked pretty cool.  The game does look complicated, though.  The guy who demoed it said that he is developing a new version of this called Pacific ???.  He also described himself as the game developer, not designer.  Either way, I will definitely be interested if and when that is released.  For any Atlantic Storm fans who happen to read this, he said that this would not be soon.

Cute little card game where each player plays for themselves but has to cooperate to capture points on individual tricks when a good convoy comes along. The mechanism works well especially for multiple players (5 or more preferably) and on the whole is pretty effective. But I don't particularly find it giving a good suspension of disbelief enjoyment. Mostly it's a clever and effective social game.

Atlantic Storm is a fun trick taking card game based on the WW2 Battle of the Atlantic.  Every round you decide whether to help escort a convoy across (by playing Allied cards), or to try to sink it (playing German cards).  Aircraft, submarines, surface vessels and various technological tricks compete to sink or save the convoy.  A light, fun game at its best with 4-6 players, with plenty of diplomacy and an interesting theme.  No significant knowledge of the REAL Battle of the Atlantic necessary.

Long out of print, unfortunately - but Pacific Typhoon is a new game that plays almost exactly like Atlantic Storm.  By the same designer.

A nifty lite card-driven wargame.  I like the ability to play as either the German or the Allies depending how other people respond.  However, due to the fact that you can only declare support and lay down cards once per convoy/battle, this give the last player an enormous advantage each time.  The "fated" mechanic is a great touch, as well as the way to increase your hand size.  However, I'm not very fond of the die rolling aspect, even though it was somewhat limited, I still don't appreciate the randomness it added to the game, so much so that I had to deduct a whole point from my rating.

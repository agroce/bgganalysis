sleeved, hand colored PnP version with chessex bulk dice

Currently a 7.5, with some development could easily be an 8.5 - challenging and highly thematic, even in B&W.

Update: I had a small rule wrong. Soild 8 for me now.

:d6-1: PnP I´d really love to get hold of!

Have the dice for it - just need the rest of the game....

Files were taken down for a while but are back online again. Considering investing in table mat and cards through Artscow if I can't get someone to print it for me.

I created this game, so it's perhaps a bit unfair to add a rating for my own game :-) Still, I enjoy it and play it a fair bit, so an 8 seems fair. Up to an 9 since the component facelift :-)

Theme works great with this game. Enjoyable. Playing time for first game 90 min. Will be less for next. Dice/crew function equivalent is memorised after first few turns. Read walkthrough first then played once on easy, then read walkthrough and questions too see if I played correctly.

RATING: 7
Played once so far and it's great. Only played on Easy to get to learn the rules/cards/mechanics and it got a bit frantic on the last mission due to a big storm of bad rolls and events. Lots of fun. The theme would come through more if I had custom dice and the cards had art on them, but still very thematic.

This is an OK PnP game.  Card backs and graphics are well done.

Game uses a system very similar to Deep Space D-6, except you have 10 dice to manage.  Up to 4 dice may become "locked", until they trigger an event.

It is a "dice management" game (ie. dice/personnel are your resources).

The theme is well rendered, and every game will be different, as there are more cards in the (3) decks then you will go through in a game.

Although I do not mind rolling dice, I found the game a little too repetitive, especially when overwhelmed by "Events".  As most missing require you to draw an event each turn, and scanners may add to this if triggered, it becomes an event management game, as although you would like to advance the mission (due to time pressure), you cannot as you need to address the events else they will pile up quickly, and sap your resources.

As in any good euro type game, you will seldom be able to do everything you would like to do.

Getting "Development" cards is key, as it helps mitigate some of the randomness, as you only get to roll dice once per turn (normally).

My preference is of the Yum/Yatze/D-Day Dice/BANG! the dice game system, in which you get to roll up to 3 times, in an effort to get the results you need/want.  Locking dice is an excellent mechanic, in that there are risks involved in re-rolling, and after you have locked 4+ dice, another event will be added.  Risk Management.

Due to the repetitiveness, after 3 plays, I will probably not play this again for a while. (tried Basic and Medium levels)

This is a very interesting PNP game. It breaks the mold for dice games in that there's no rerolls. You make due with what you make due. And yet there's a surpising amount of decisions to be made.

Two negatives: (1) A few bad rolls can really just end you faster than you'd expect. (2) Some of the mission cards are unbalanced. Missions where you just take damage are just so much easier than missions that force you to draw an event card every turn.

There is so much to like.  I casually enjoy the theme, but love the mechanisms.

The fact that there is no reset in threats between missions keeps  tension always cranked; I enjoy it a whole lot!

Solo dice game. This looks like the game Deep Space D-6 tried to become but failed.

I finally played the game. Very interesting. Can become repetitive after some mission, but at least there is a lot of choice in this game, the game does not play by itself.

I would suggest adding more variety using different ship models. I found that there was a lot of development card for the amount you are going to acquire through the game. There is also a lot of missions when you only need 5, but again, I imagine it's for the variety.

Hope the game gets published.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This is a solid PnP game involving dice which dictate your actions. Feels quite thematic and there is generally a fair bit of tension whether you'll make it and/or complete your missions. One can get into a death spiral quickly if one isn't careful!

PnP that is a nice little sci-fi game of completing Missions while dealing with Events and gaining beneficial Development cards.  Roll 10 dice.  Each number represents a certain crew member who are able to handle certain duties; 6-Command; 5-Science; 4-Medical; 3-Engineer; 2-Security; 1-Scanners/Threat.

Pure solo.
Easy mode is pretty easy.
Looking forward to more.
I am in the process of putting a new face on this by reprinting the cards and the board.  I'll be using the images from the animated series (files are in the files section) and I will finally invest in the custom dice.  After all that, I shall make a gamebox.


Good about the game: The only real worker placement game I have, and the workers are dice (perfect!). I love the Trek theme.  
Not good about the game: With a couple of adjustments the game could be better.  I recommend getting the custom dice and maybe the custom cards too.

This was better than I expected.  It used the "Do Ya?" mechanic from neighborhood poker games to create a cohesive, tense boardgame.  So, press-your-luck with some constrained route building.  The latter part felt like the setup of [b]10 Days in Africa[/b].  It was a very pleasant ride.

For a route-building game (of which I'm never a fan) it's actually kinda good; but the huge amount of luck and the pasted-on theme prevent Neptun from being a great game.

Push-your-luck. 
Ameritrash people will hate it as "too Euro" and claim unfairly a pasted-on theme; Euro players may think there is too much randomness - but the game is to manage that randomness.
Skill will out.
Given how many "not quite good enough" games have come out this year's Essen I'd give it a shot at SdJ though it risks being too complex for the family category and not (apparently) complex enough for the Kennerspiel.

Primera partida de 4 jugadores sin expansiones. 
Me entretuve jugándolo, pero a mi parecer hay un poquito más de azar del que me gustaría al momento de tomar los contratos. Sin embargo como dije me entretuve y espero que con más partidas y las expansiones suba de nota ;)

Has some good design elements, but gold is too under-powered. Needs an endgame  rule on the order of "1 VP for each 2 gold." Being able to rearrange your contracts might help, too. First play with 4 took almost 2 hours.

The Mediterranean trading game might be a heavily saturated Niche of the Euro, but this one is by Dirk Henn and that alone usually generates some interest for me. It's actually a lighter design with some push your luck elements. I like how the Contracts are put together, and determining trade winds, movement, etc, as you struggle to complete those contracts, is pretty interesting. A good looking game to boot. It's no Alhambra, and I also favor Colonia over it, but Neptun is a decent play and not too much of a headache to teach as a gateway.

While an interesting "pick up and deliver game", with "push you luck" elements in the selection of different contracts, the "trading goods in the Mediterranean" theme is pasted on and the game does not scale down well to 3 players.

Neptun's gameplay consists 3 different phases: 1) acquiring contracts (port city + good type + oar speed), 2) fulfilling selected contracts, and 3) scoring.  The first player must choose between revealing hidden contracts or selecting contracts another player has already revealed.  The remaining players will have fewer and fewer of these contracts to choose from until the turn is completed.  This is repeated 4 more times, with the turn order potentially shuffling between each turn as the oar speed included in each contract selected determines your initiative for the following turn.  With 5 contracts in hand, players will use 5 of their different oar cards to move throughout the Mediterranean to deliver their contracted goods to the specified city.  Oars cards not only determine your boat's speed, but also modify the wind's strength for the following turn.  Once a contract is fulfilled, the player can decide whether to move along the track in the region's temple to the gods or to earn gold coins - Gold coins can be used to add to your boat's speed each turn.  An increasing number of points are awarded at the end of each of the 3 years to the players in 1st place on each temple track (end of all 3 years), 2nd place (end of 2nd and 3rd years), and 3rd place (end of 3rd year).  Points are also awarded to the players with more gold at the end of each year in a similar fashion.

The game is advertised to accommodate 3 to 5 players, although the only difference in setup/gamplay between  each of these player options is that there is always one more contract available during the first phase than there are players playing (4 in a 3 player game, 5 in a 4 player game, and 6 in a 5 player game).  The rulebook doesn't describe any changes to the number of point tokens awarded for first / second / third place finishes on each temple track across the three years.  This allows a 3rd place finisher on a temple track to still earn points at the end of year 3, even if they haven't moved from the starting space on the track.  Knowing this noticeably altered players' decision making towards the end of the game, foregoing movement on temple tracks (where the rank / end of the year point changes were less likely) for gold coins.  With only 3 players, there was substantially less competition for individual temples, and larger gaps between different players within those temples.  However, with 4 or 5 players, these 3rd place points are not guaranteed and must be strategically fought for at each of the 5 different temples.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
In Neptun, there are 3 rounds where all players gather 5 contracts to be delivered to different locations in south Europe and north Africa. Planning is key as the contracts must be delivered in order and there is a bonus for delivering all 5 contracts in one round. Each delivery provides gold and steps on temple tracks for different regions. Then, points are awarded for whomever has made the most steps on each temple track. It's a bunch of fairly straightforward mechanics that seem to work pretty well together and there is definitely nothing special here. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Read the rules... interesting

Each round there are 5 push-your-luck card draws where you choose where you want to deliver.  Included in this is a movement card that also affects turn order for the next push-your-luck card draw.  When you take a card you put it in one of 5 positions.

After everyone has 5 cards, everyone delivers in the order that was chosen above.  This is all multi-player solitaire.  Deliveries get you either cash or track advancements.

Then, whoever is in 1st (2nd/3rd) place on each of the tracks get VPs.  Rinse and repeat.

Myeh.  Looks fun to play but I don't see why I'd need to own it.

Neptun is a fairly cleverly designed game of making goods deliveries, and puzzling out the order in which you'll make the deliveries.

It also contains a neat drafting system for the contracts, where not only are you picking which delivery you will make, but also the manpower you have to make deliveries.  So, sometimes you see you really need more rowing power and will settle for a crappy contract to get the rowing card paired with it.  If you're lucky, maybe you'll find a great contract also with a great rowing card!

The only thing I didn't like was that it felt like the game was playing me sometimes.  There are only so many options available, and sometimes you just get what you get.  You'll luck out and get contracts that work well together some times, and other times you're screwed.  While I did well in the game, I felt like luck had more to do with it than making good decisions, even though you can surely make a terrible decision that screws you as well.

Overall, a decent, fairly simple game with some fun to be had.

Traded away as ultimately I felt that it failed to meet my expectations for a game of it's weight and length. It's too easy for an inexperienced player to keep searching for the perfect combo and give the game away to the next player in sequence, which makes it a bad match for my group as we don't tend to repeat play games very often. To add insult to injury, it's not a game that inspires repeated back to back play.

2014-10-19 : Very streamlined and clean design with good graphics and easy mechanics. Will pick this up when it becomes available in our FLGS
2017-04-15 : Well, it never appeared in our FLGS, but I finally managed to land a copy in a trade and I must say our initial impressions got confirmed. This is a very easy to teach, very fast to play game that keeps everyone engaged all the time. There's some luck involved, but it's of the push-your-luck variety which I tend to like.
Upgrading this to an 8, but only with the right group.
2017-04-23 : Brought it out again, and again everyone liked it - it's not a deep game you want to play every week, but it's easy to teach and easy to grasp for people on their first play.
2017-06-19 : Feels a bit played out - we're going to play this with one last group and then it goes onto the trade pile - score lowered to 6 as a consequence.

Agree with the DT.TV review generally. Even though the placements require educated guesses, it's still interesting to think through the options and see how the subsequent movements unfold.  (With 2 players playing two colours each - not always the first choice in playing a game - but players are afforded a bit more control over the wind speeds and hence movement points.)  Kickstarted into the Queen collection.

Man nimmt sich aus der Auslage mit kleiner Zockerei 5x3 Karten bestehend aus Zielort, Ware und Windstärke, bastelt sich damit eine Tour aus 5 Reisen und segelt über das Mittelmeer zu den Hafenstädten der Antike, wo man die Waren in Geld oder Einflusspunkte umwandelt. Ohne weiter auf die Details einzugehen: NEPTUN funktioniert, kickt aber nicht. Es wirkt in seinen repetitiven Runden staubig und altbacken. Was vor einigen Jahren und einem weniger lustlosen, muffeligen Artwork vielleicht noch als okayer Durchschnitt durchgegangen wäre, erschöpft sich Ende 2014 nach einer Partie. NEPTUN ist Old School als Museum, in der das spielende Leben als lebloses Artefakt zur distanzierten Begutachtung ausliegt.

(03/04/2015) Comment based on three plays.

An interesting new design from Dirk Henn, designer of Wallenstein and Shogun (that was nine years ago!), combining the push-your-luck aspect of contract selection and pick-up-and-deliver, all in an immersive Mediterranean Age of Homer theme.

I've enjoyed Shogun for a number of years and was interested to see where the designer's mind has been in the past nine years. With Wallenstein/Shogun, there is was the chaotic element of the cube tower. This time the chaos comes from the randomness of the contract cards, as well as the unpredictable nature of the wind power that helps move the ships around in Neptun.

A number of "contracts" are set up, where each contract consists of three cards: 1) Delivery City, 2) Good, and 3) Oar Power. There are N+1 sets of these, all face down. The first player flips up the first set and must decide if he wants this contract or not. If he passes on the first contract, he can see the second set, and so forth, but can never go back and choose an earlier contract. This is the push-your-luck aspect of the game. The following players go through a similar exercise of having to select a contract, but they have the advantage of seeing the rejected contracts.

Fifteen major cities of Antiquity that surrounded the Mediterranean are represented on the map, with predetermined shipping routes on the board. The distances between the cities is randomly determined at the beginning, so each game is different every time. As each player selects contracts, they must then decide beforehand in what order to deliver them in, based on a queue that holds five contracts. Starting from Crete, the player must deliver the contracts in order, or they will forfeit a bonus. Since they do not know what the future contracts are, this phase presents some agonizing and tense decision making.

The fifteen cities are divided into regions of three cities each, with each region having a temple. As the goods are delivered to each city, the contract will either give gold or "steps" on a respective temple track. At the end of each of three delivery phases, VP "chits" are awarded based on the relative standing in each temple track, with the relative values reminiscent of Thurn and Taxis

After contracts are acquired, the players attempt to fulfill those contacts by sailing from Crete to the various cities in the Mediterranean. As mentioned before, the distances between the cities is varied, requiring oar power and wind power. The oar power cards that the players collected with the contracts are now played in order to determine how far their ships can travel per turn. The oar cards also help determine the wind power for the next turn, which may affect their travel plans. However, each player secretly selects one oar power card to play in the current round and all reveal simultaneously. The oar and wind power are added together to see the total distance their ship can travel on the present turn. If they arrive at a city, then they fulfill a contract. The chaotic aspect of the game comes in the variability of the wind power. Each oar power also has a wind power modifier, where all the cards' wind power modifiers are added together to determine the "forecast" of wind for the next turn. One turn, it may be a strong wind propelling ships 10 nautical miles, while in the next turn, it may be dead still, preventing most ships from making it to the next city.

It is the variability of the contracts, the agonizing choices presented by setting delivery order, and the chaotic nature of the wind that makes this game entertaining to play. There are some profound strategy and tactics that become apparent with repeated plays, but on the surface it can be an entertaining family game, accessible to all ages. It is wonderful that Days of Wonder decided to include three expansions, which add some flavor and dimensions to the game, as the base game can become flat fairly quickly with veteran gamers. It is a solid "7".

Only one play, but I found myself still thinking about the strategies the day after... always the sign of a great game! Has a definite chance of going way up. Of course, if has a couple Queen Games rules issues, but once that's aside, it's a great gem! (The left side of the city cards show the goods that produce gold and the right side produce the temple points... 3, 2, or 1, top to bottom. Might seem obvious to someone, but 5 of us had no idea and thought every card paid out one gold AND points, even though the rules say OR points. It generally helps if the examples provided actually give you examples of questions you might actually encounter in a game and not just examples of what was obviously just stated in the rules that nobody was questioning in the first place...)

Programming trade routes in the Mediterranean sounded like an interesting variation on a well-worn subject. Unluckily, it's highly random if the available deliveries fit into a player's route and what they are worth. The challenge is to gain empirical values what routes can work out and hope for the best. Neptun is a bit too long and too repetitive for what is on offer.

It is fine but probably not one I will hold on to and play. I'd be curious to try a couple more plays, but likely won't seek it out. The push your luck on the city/good/sail cards was a bit interesting as well as trying to figure out your course of sail, but majorities will look quite similar to Alhambra.

RATING: 4
Push your luck when picking up contracts plus having to lock the cards in place made this pretty uninteresting. Oh, I got lucky. Oh I didn't. The rest of the game is just playing the cards to move around and deliver the contracts while having control of 1/n of the wind for next turn.

Neptun scratches a similar itch for me as Concordia. It is a decent game where you are speculating on good values and how easy it is to get them to their destination. You load your goods each turn onto your ship in a queue, and have to unload them in a specific order. Skipping over a good in your queue makes that good unavailable for the rest of the round, becoming a waste of space on your ship.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Perhaps a little underwhelming, this game, with its Alhambra-style scoring, depends completely on the method of contract selection: a push-your-luck draft with blind prioritization. I enjoyed it at a 6 level but people who don't enjoy those mechanics will be annoyed.

Played with Queenie #2 and thought it was a bit more interesting. Queenie #3 may give you something to do on "off" turns which would be welcome.

tl;dr: OK

Queen Games always has nice packaging and components, don't they? And they stopped making those thick boxes that didn't need to be that thick. But enough about the components, we're here to talk about how it plays, aren't we?
This game has a cool card row mechanism, a nice planning mechanism, some nice tracks where you score points for majorities, a sailing component, a set collecting component. And it all works together very well. It's not too complex, it moves along nicely, it doesn't take too long. Quite nice.
I was a bit annoyed by the lack in flexibility when planning your route. I know that's a major part of the game, but especially on a first game, this can be quite painful. I wish there was a way to like change the position of one card, maybe at a cost.

So, this is an OK game, but it didn't get me excited that much. It's fine to play a couple of times though I guess.

I have to admit, I like spatial sailing and pickup and deliver, for some reason. I just like the traveling aspect and Neptun seems to actually do some neat things with the weather bonuses or penalties, plus some base economics that affects movement and potentially deliveries.
It also plays up to 5 which is becoming more and more important as time goes by, so I'm going to give this one a go and report back, maybe even with my first ever review for BGG! The people must be told!!

on the other hand, it is a bit too long for what it is and the setup/teardown are a bit too lengthy. probably it isnt a very replayable game

--------------
[EDIT] after 2 plays, i would like to raise the vote because there are some interesting decisions and yes, there is also tension... but at the same time, our third turn was quite stupid because we already could see, from the cards chosen, that temples would have not changed hand. So everyone was just collecting coins to have the majority

I also need to implement an house rule that i can't see in the rulebook: if i am at 0 in a temple, i will NOT take any point from it.
Otherwise, starting with a bottom disc at the beginning is an advantage because if noone visits that temple, the player at the bottom will get more points without no effort.
--------------------


3rd play: we used the rule (unstated) that you DO NOT take any points from a temple if you have never given an offer to that temple. This is much better as it forces you to go around the map. We started seeing some more tactics/strategies and we are looking better at the situation... this game was more tense. Slightly increased the rating but still there is too much luck while picking the cities.

Great wind mechanic, good art, very light and simple game, yet at moments tense (opening new contract) and rewarding - I simply don't understand why it is so underrated and unsupported - it seems to me that the designer and Queen Games are ashamed of it - they don't answer questions regarding it, they don't sell it on their webpage... odd. 
The only fault would be player numbers range (2-player unsupported) although you could comfortably play with two colors each. 

Highly appreciated in my group so it makes it my best investment ever (according to hours played-money spent ratio, since i bought it from 365games for 12 pounds with shipping :-D

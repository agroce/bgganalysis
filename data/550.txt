I really enjoyed this. It's a great idea, although I'm not sure about the dragons and elves in the artwork - probably a sign of its age. Also the scoring system doesn't quite ring true and if I wanted to be gamerish about it I could possibly analyse the faults, but I won't 'cos basically it's a fun party game (has anyone mentioned that yet?).

I like the puzzle aspect of this sculpting/deduction  game. It's really important to tell new players that this is a riddle game, not a sculpting game. Otherwise, chosen words are too hard or too easy. The slowness of the game/guessing isn't all that appealing. Still a unique game I'll take out once in a while with the blob rules.

When I first got this game I thought "Well, this is lame, it's just another version of Cluzzle." (Yes, I know this game came out first, but I played Cluzzle first.) When we played this game, I was amazed to see that it is much better than Cluzzle. Why? Well, for one thing it gives a much better bonus for being a good guesser. This makes it so you don't need to be superb at the sculpting aspect to have a shot at winning. Another great aspect is the opportunity to get letters in the answers, so you can work on a puzzle that is stumping you. Finally, it has a benefit of each player making at least 2 sculptures, which means even if you blow it on one, you still have a shot of getting some guesses on your other sculpture. I just had a blast playing this game, and think it has some strong potential. I am slightly annoyed by the boring aspect of the dragon spaces, but I understand the reason for them to be there, because it pushes towards the end of the game faster and gives you insentive to use your jewels. Not a huge problem, though, and I look forward to getting this one to the table quite a bit in the future.

RATING: 6
Man, looking at the board just makes me wince - whenever I introduce someone to this game, I invariably have to rush and explain I haven't dragged out some kindergarten game by mistake.

Other comments have mentioned the importance of having the "right" group of people for this. Bingo, baby.

You get a few chuckles out of the game ("What in the name of all that is holy is this...thing?!?"), but it tends to overstay its welcome by about 20 minutes or so.

Suggested rules mods you see here on the Geek can make things better, so dig around.

RATING: 8
This game was a lot more fun than I expected.  I would usually shy away from a game that has an artistic element (since I have no talent in that area).  Lacking artistic talent is no handicap in this game, and can even work in your favor.  What is really neat is figuring the right questions to ask to solve other peoples' riddles.  The game also provides a decent amount of laughs.  Definitely a good buy.

I think that I found this game after playing Cranium and really enjoying the clay shape sub-game.  After buying this and playing it with the kids I enjoyed it FAR MORE than the Cranium sub-game.  The concept of "not too good" was brilliant I thought.  I bought Cluzzle because I thought it would be easier to get non-gamers to play it, but then I missed all the cool other bits of the game track, so I dumped Cluzzle and happily get out Barbarossa when I want a clay game :-)

A wonderfully entertaining puzzle building and sculpting game that you can play with gamers and non gamers alike and have a good time. Ingenious rules which encourage people to sculpt puzzles that are not too hard and not too easy, maximising ons score if the puzzle is solved mid-game some time and costing points if it&#039;s solved early or late or not at all!

Fun clay modeling game with a clever mechanism where you do no want to make your clay models too easy or too difficult to guess.
The board aspect of the game detracts a little from the clay modelling, which is the fun part.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Lots of fun with a light-hearted group just looking to have a good time.  Build some objects out of clay, and then try to guess what objects the other players made.  You do this by running around a game board to get more information about the objects until you're able to make a good guess!

The interesting aspect is that you need to make your objects both not too hard nor too easy to guess.  If it gets guessed before too many other objects do, you lose points.  Likewise if it is guessed too late.  Get guessed in the middle, however, and you score points.

I bring this one out when family/friends are over, and it always gets a good response!

This game has all the good parts of a party game...without the mindlessness that too often accompanies the genre.  There is just enough strategy to keep things interesting without stifling the table banter or slowing things down.  Best of all...you can teach the game to a casual gamer in about 4 minutes.  This game is deserving of its SdJ status (when you put it in the company of games like Settlers and Ticket to Ride), but you wouldn't mistake it for a gamer's game.

Better-than-it-ought-to-be party game...hideous board artwork, some superflous elements but fun and often hysterical, which makes up for it.  "Blob" rules are essential!  The best part is jabbing the little models with the arrows, nothing beats that.

The clay sculpture element is kind of fun, but the game built around it--the moving, the guessing, everything--is unnecessary.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The clay-sculpture, riddle-guessing game. When played with the right group of people who make the sculptures just right (not too hard, not too easy), this game is a HUGE amount of fun, and would easily rate a 9.  But if players make their sculptures too hard or too easy, the game can break down, and a lot of the fun factor can go with it.  So that drags the overall rating down a bit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
You start with a little molding clay, and try to sculpt two items - possibly borrowing from a list the game provides.  The challenge is you want your "riddles" to be a little bit tough to guess, but not so tough they stump the other players.

Then you take turns either gaining letters in a riddle to narrow down your answer, or asking simple yes/no questions to get at it.  To force you to be careful and move the game along, other spaces give you crystals (which you can trade in to do exactly what you want on a turn) or dragons which give everyone else a point.

Far more fun than it has any right to be, Barbarossa lifts 20 Questions to a whole new level.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Components: I used to think that all clays are created equal. But the clay in Barbarossa is of much higher quality than in Cluzzle. The board is very pretty, though the different caverns have non-intuitive symbols for the actions that occur there. The pawns are bright and heavy, and the arrows are functional.

Experience: I think the entire board could be dispensed with, except the score track; perhaps it forces creativity upon players, so that they cannot always ask for letters in a word. This game is fun, though; I really enjoy trying to puzzle through the different shapes, and the thrill of hoping mine will be guessed, but only during that optimal window. Also, the game lasts just long enough for a few tough sculptures to be guessed, and for some others to remain forever enigmas.

Just a touch fragile, as it depends greatly on the guessability of the sculptures created. Too easy makes for a flat game.  Too hard makes for a long, long game.  But when it's right, it's right.

RATING: 7
Hard to get some people to make the "middle-of-the-road" style clay models... Often too hard or too easy to guess and it's hard for people to understand this on their first game.  After they screw up so badly, they wind up not wanting to play again.  I'd really enjoy playing this more with an experienced crowd (that actually wanted to play it again).

One of those games which sounds interesting, but just never quite gets there.

RATING: 5
Very funny party game that does make you think a little bit. Players sculpt two &quot;puzzles&quot; from a hunk of modelling clay in their colour, and the other players must deduce what they are. Players earn points for successfully guessing sculptures. If your sculptures are guessed too early or too late in the game, you lost points. However, if your sculptures are guessed in the middle of the game, you gain points! Thus, the idea is to make your models suitably vague, but still guessable! Great game for when you&#039;ve played too much Pictionary!  You must use the &quot;anti-blob&quot; rule - at game end sculptures with no arrows are -5 points, and one arrow are -3 points.

Sculpt some clay, roll a die, try to guess what everyone else made.  A weak theme added onto a game of "what's that supposed to be?"  Not horrible.

Not bad with people who sculpt to the right level of difficulty.

Barbarossa overall is an enjoyable art game. I think the mechanics that Teuber built around essentially a guessing game work relatively okay to keep the game moving. However, Our game stretched to about 2 hours, which is way too long for a game like this. I think our problems were compounded by trying to keeping everything in memory. Maybe recording information down when asking questions would be best? But I could see why one might not want too. I think I would though, next time. I hate the board option where "opponents receive one point" because the game could be won on that, but I get why it is there: the game would not move towards completion based on the "guessing" mechanics alone. I think this game works best when all players are able to design their models to the "just right" level the rules suggest, but that is easier said than done for most. Still, I would play this one again because I like the creativity and deduction part of this game very much.

Barbarossa is a good party game or lighthearted large group game when you need something easy and fun. You have to reassure people that they don't have to be good modellers. The key to this game is getting the models just at the right degree of obscurity, and then asking the right questions. Some stock questions soon emerge (is it a living thing, is it bigger than a person etc). Would tire of it if played too often, but great fun now and again.

I find this game very amusing. You build little colored clay sculptures. The trick is to make them real enough that they can be guessed by mid-game, but not so real that they get guessed right away or never as you won't get any points that way.

This was re-implemented in what looks like a blatant rip-off by the game Cluzzle.

The worst game I've ever played.

I thought it might actually be a parody of bad games given how many awful mechanisms/features it included:

* Start with a dubious premise. It's *very* difficult to make a sculpt that's ultimately identifiable but hard to guess. Hell, even the rulebook can't do it -- have a look at the "just right" illustrations and see how many you can immediately guess.

* Severely limit the fun. In these sorts of games (charades, Pictionary, etc.), the fun part is acting/drawing/creating an item for others to guess. But in Barbarossa, you get to do it just once.

* Roll & Move -- yep, there's a mechanism that everyone loves, right?

* Timing issues, because deciding who "interrupted" first is always enjoyable.

* Gang up on one player, it doesn't even have to be the leader.

* Throw in some player obfuscation. (I once had a player answer "yes" when asked if her sculpture was a musical instrument. It turned out to be a "stick.") And by all means, don't sculpt a "car," make it an "automobile" instead.

Players build models out of clay which other players must guess.  Players move pawns around a board which gives them ability to ask clues and makes guesses about other player's creations.  Neat concept, but I'm not creative enough to be any good at it.

Many folk claim that this game drags too much at the end. Consider using the blob varient where the max number of victory points moves down the longer you play. I really like making odd shapes and having to guess at them. maybe it is just me, also like staring at clouds to find shapes and faces. Long walks in the rain, Pina Coladas....

RATING: 5
It's an interesting idea, but a very odd choice for SDJ. It's more like a party game than a family/euro. The way that you have to make things that are good but not TOO good is a nifty idea, and the scoring reflects this well. However, this game seems a bit too complicated and LONG for what it is. I could see a similar idea being executed better just with clay and guessing. The board and scoring track add very little strategy.

This is occasionally a great experience, and sometimes a total clunker.  If people are creative in just the right way, it's amazing.  If people abuse the "blob rule" or just happen to make obvious stuff, it can be pretty painful.  In general, people have a good time with this in my experience, but be prepared to pull the plug on a game if it's not clicking.

Barbarossa is one of those games that you don't really expect much from.  It's got a weird concept.  Creating riddles for Barbarossa in some cave.  I don't get it.  But what it does have is some really enjoyable gameplay.  I really like how riddles come together throughout and, should everyone sculpt correctly, the riddles aren't obvious, but also aren't completely unguessable.  I really like this as people with or without creativity can get into it and still have a good chance to win.  Fun stuff!

Barbarossa is Pictionary with clay. You come up with two single-word nouns, and sculpt somewhat abstract representations of them, in the hopes that you make them just hard enough to score the most points and win. 

2005 version is a streamlined (smaller) version. Barbarossa is a gamer themed ver of Cluzzel.

Tom suggests the Cluzzle might be a little bit more fun.

Newer version is more portable and a tad less attractive without the circular board. Tom Vasel says the following on this:
"New vs. Old: The old version of Barbarossa had a much larger board, larger and cooler tokens, and supported up to six players. In fact, after playing both, I think that I enjoy the older version a little bit better. However, the draw of the new copy is that it is smaller, more portable, and a bit simpler to explain to newcomers. I think the choice in deciding which to buy would be availability, and the expected number of people to play the game. I also miss the plastic black arrows of the old game (they were replaced by cardboard counters), but I do realize that they broke fairly easily. Either way, I love skewering a riddle.""

Seemed like it would be a good, light game...but has gotten progressively longer (translate: frustrating) with each play.

This is probably just not the game for me as I take games very seriously and this one needs too many tweaks to make it worthwhile.

What this has to do with Barbarossa, I've no idea.  JeroenD's copy from '88 had some pretty damn hard lumps that were called clay... The game was quite fun.  Winning/losing means little because of the random moving and the ability to ignore players to score them few points if desired, so all the fun is guessing the objects, and that kept us very entertained.  Nice family fare.

After all, that's what wizards do, right?  You don't have to have any artistic ability whatsoever, in fact it may work against you.  There's also a board to move around to get "elf stones", etc. (I'll remember this game the next time I hear the phrase "pasted on")

A fun game because you make little clay things and don't have to be good at sculpting. (which was the most fun part of Cranium, for me)

My one problem with the game is that I feel the endgame has issues. If you made complete blobs as your figures, you aren't actually punished unless someone actually guesses them during the endgame.  There needs to be more consequences to make your figures at least somewhat recognizable. (Possibly penalizing 2 pts for every sculpture still unguessed when that phase is reached)

Playing with silly putty for adults, everyone makes 2 things then tries to figure what others 2 things are. Simple right ?

The reason I don't like this terribly much, boils down to "it's a party game".  No strategy beyond "mold something not too difficult but not too easy" (Once I molded a "superconducting supercollider" [donut], which nobody guessed, but it was worth it for how much it amused me).  Also the plasticine makes my fingers all nasty, which is annoying because we usually game at a diner where I need to pick up french fries.  I do enjoy "twenty questions", but I see little need to infest it with a game board and pieces.  At least with Zendo, I have shiny pyramids.

I played the original version, and it was a lot more fun than the re-release that only supports 4 players.  The idea is nifty, but requires the right gaming group to be fun.  You need to make a house rule to penalize sculptures that have no arrows at all at the end of the game.

At first sight, the scoring system and rules seem way too fiddly for what this game actually tries to be. A guessing game a la 20 questions (Yes/No answers) and the clues are models made of plasticine. Way before Dixit, this game forces the players to create their models in a way that they give away enough to be guessed but not too early or too late. Some people will be annoyed by the clunky way this game goes about its business and also the roll-and-move portion of the game which can win you the game if you're lucky. I think this game is okay, but all the mechanics and tweaks don't change the fact that this game is pretty much a light 20-Questions clone and if that is something you don't enjoy, this game won't change your mind. I think there are better and more interesting party games out there, so I will probably trade this away.

Some overly complex rules and the choice of oddly specific vocabulary terms (how do I model a "commode" vs a "toilet" with modeling clay?) made this a flop for me. 

I like the concept of targeting the middle ground, but I think it could have been executed a lot better.

There could be *a lot* of downtime with players who can't ask questions quickly. I own the Mayfair version that reduces the maximum number of players from five to four, which I think is an improvement.

The Mayfair version has a modular board. We only play with the question space and the guess-a-letter space; all the other spaces are not that much fun.

With the right crowd it can be very entertaining. But the fun heavily depends on the quality of the riddles. If they are too easy it's no fun because everybody will imediately recognize the item displayed without asking any questions. But if there are just one or two not so obvious riddles it wont work too. So the optimum should be all riddles with the same difficutly to recognize which is hard to achieve.

Simples de mais, tão simples que parece um daqueles jogos que jogávamos na escola durante as aulas, apenas com uma caneta e um papel… Klaus Teuber aplicou-lhe uns recortes, adicionou a acção pelo dado (que hoje seria precocemente condenada) e inventou um mecanismo para o controlar. Resultado? Pois, jogo do ano, numa altura onde a oferta era pouca e a exigência também! O jogo não é mau, mas fica muito atrás de Wacky Wacky West e, em especial, de Catan, os maiores sucessos do mesmo autor.

It's a good thing I suck at sculpting.  Where my friends make their puzzles quite easy to guess just upon a cursory inspection, mine require many questions and sometimes never even get a single arrow during play.

As for the rest of the game, the theme is for fourth graders and the "lightning bolt" mechanism is quite unfair in our group, but it is still enjoyable on occasion.

Clever puzzle and sculpting game. Brings out some creativity.

House rules:
-5 points if your sculpture isn't guessed at the end, -3 if it is only guessed once. (This is a real rule in other versions, and seems pretty essential!)
You get to guess after asking for a letter.
You cannot "interrupt" another player's turn with a black cube.

Played 2+ times. First Impressions,  I've been waiting a long time to play this.  It was quite fun.  I like how the question phase is broken up into two parts separated by "Nos".  Definitely dependent on peoples ability to sculpt a bit abstractly and to make mental leaps.  A fun party game.  **UPDATE** I really enjoyed this the second time, with all the rules worked out.  Yes the action you get on your turn is a bit random, but the riddle guessing was SO much fun.  I don't know how great a game it is but I love the riddle part.  Coming up with questions that will help you and not the other people and having the ability to get letters.  It's also fun to choose something just difficult enough that the first letter won't give it away immediately and sculpting it abstractly.  Rating has room to move but I'm happy for now. **UPDATE**  I really enjoy the sculpting and the riddle guessing, but at the end of the day I don't like the scoring system.  I like the changing rewards and the first vs. second guess, but you can game the score system by waiting to guess someone's riddles until they will get negative points and by making your riddles so hard that no one even attempts them (the last couple don't get guessed before the game end).  I think this needs to be played with a party game mentality.  2008/11/20

This is a great game, but there's a large learning curve for how "vague" to make your sculptures.

Another semi-party game.Although the maximum number of players for the classic version is somewhat limited at 4. I would categorize this game as more of a party game along the lines of cranium. However, there is no trivia involved in this process. The game tries to balance good and bad sculptors by making those who are mediocre stand out as winners in this game. That way, people who are poor at sculpting still stand a pretty good chance in the game. Decent design though I do not like the movement wheel and also the dice rolling mechanism. The usage of jewels somewhat balances out the use of the dice though the dice, in the latter stages of the game, seem quite useless as people were hurling out curses and also moving around the gem using the jewels. Still, this game has a space in my collection due to its uniqueness. I do not have any game that requires making 3D models or sculptures.

This is the worst game I have ever played. I would rate it a zero if I could.  It had potential but ambiguously created clay objects create a severe game play problem that cannot be fixed.  Play something else instead, such as Heimlich & Company, if you want a good bluffing/outwitting game.

very cool game.  I have an image in my head of my friend pointing to my sculpture and saying, "Does that thing have pants on?"  

The jist is you have to make a sculpture that is not too detailed and not too abstract. The mechanics have been created to allow strategy, depth and some clever thinking.  It is a party style game in a way, but with a little more class, depth and strategy than most.

The game starts with players using modeling clay to make objects that can be guessed by the other players. Players then take turns to move around the board either by rolling a die or spending gems to choose their move. The spaces landed on determine actions. Either the other players receive victory points, or you can ask a letter of an object or you can ask general questions or make a single guess until you get a NO answer. Players also have three curse stones that they can throw down twice in the game and make a guess.

The roll-and-move aspect is weak, but since you can mitigate that by spending crystals to move where you want to go, it's not so bad.  Deducing people's sculptures is fun, however.  This feels mostly like a sculpting board game of the parlor game Botticelli.  I like the scoring setup, as well.  ...and who doesn't enjoy sticking arrows into clay sculptures?

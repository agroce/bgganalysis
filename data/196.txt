Just about my favorite game of all time. It has randomness but your job is to control this as much as is possible. Theme is just terrific. The cards are great looking and humorous. It never plays the same twice.

RATING: 5
A massive full-on bluff-a-thon. You have to commit all your influence [i]before the game starts[/i]! The rest of the time, and that time is substantial, is spent in a cagey attempt to keep the other players from guessing where your influence is while you exploit it for your benefit.

Cast iron guts, blood like ice, and eagle-eyed strategic vision are necessary for the basic game. I suspect many people can't handle it so a bunch of special power cards can optionally be used to allow for more casual chaotic, but longer, games.

One of those few games where I've literally had tears of laughter rolling down my cheeks when the party leader has croaked on a disastrous roll. Great stuff.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
1 play / 6 players (3h)

LIKE: Head scratching, role guessing, push-your luck timing when revealing influence. Was fun trying to guess who chose who, and even more fun to provoke different people into revealing who they were.

DISLIKE: Very random. More players add more chaos. Tough with the pencil and paper to keep track of influence and to react quickly. Small chits are annoying but functional. Game can be a little slow.

OVERALL: I enjoyed this game, the tension of when to reveal a high influence on your party member is fun, similar to a real-time auction.

RATING: 3
A game that needs being played at least twice to get a hang of it. If you have no idea what to do, you can get easily eliminated from the game with a slight wish of making a come back. Hence, you just linger around the table for another 2-3 hours to see whether you get one more turn. 

The problem just is that I'm not likely to play this again any time soon. Or at least within the next 5-10 years.

Got some rules played wrongly, eventually got it corrected.

A very good interactive game for 6 players. Though with 6, the game lasted abit longer. 3 hours.

Love the purging and the Siberian holidays. Getting a wave is not easy. Even if it goes down to the wire with no one winning with 3 waves, there is still a chance the other players might still snatch a victory on turn 10.

Overall, a great game. But the way the new Jolly Roger rules booklet is written, needs quiet some clarification.

Rating 8 for the game, 5 for the rules.

i wish i had rated this right after playing so i could properly recall my specific complaints.  i still had a lot of them, though.  clunky and random come to mind, but the influence predestination and tiebreaker system was the doozy.  i found myself unable to make many actual choices once the basic game began.  little to no interest in playing this game again, but i'm glad at the presumed influence that it had on "king me" and "in the shadow of the emperor" for different respective reasons.

RATING: 9
Nasty nasty fun with purging party members and sending folks to Siberia.  High fun factor, where targeting the leader is expected and required.  Should be played while speaking in heavy Russian accents.  Can your politician succesfully become party chief without dying off by aging due to the stress?

This game can last anywhere from 20 minutes to 2.5 hours when playing with a lot of people and if it goes 10 turns.  There is a lot of randomness if the people you chose to influence are chosen by others who put more influence on them, but that also creates a lot of tension.

My favorite game accessory for this game is a six pack of "Red Menace" Big Amber Ale by Hales's Ales.  A picture of a statue of Lenin on the front with the slogan, "Join the Party".  How can you go wrong with that?  I need to upload an image.

I'm giving this edition with Gorbachev on the cover a slight notch up for the chutzpah.  Apparently the first edition used Gorvachev's image without permission, and being the good socialist he sued forcing the removal of his image from the cover.

RATING: 6
One of those games that should be played more for the experience than the game itself; lots of fun can be had with all the paranoia inherent in the politburo dealings and purges, particularly if the players get into the spirit of things. 

However, I found it was relatively easy to get pretty much locked out of the game through no fault of your own. And then once that happened your involvement with the game is greatly diminished (unlike the case in Republic of Rome, due to its semi-cooperative nature). Or maybe it's just my poor playing of these political games that made it so...

Still, managing to use your KGB head to purge a party secretary that would shortly hand the victory to someone else must rank as one of those great moments in gaming. And it's the kind of thing which makes the game worth playing every now and again.

Having not touched this for 20-odd years I've just replayed it. What a joy. OK, we always needed the rules to hand to check we were playing correctly (especially during the Politburo promotion/demotion phases) but the heart of this game beats with a beautifully cynical thump. We laughed a lot - including me and I didn't come close to winning. Must remember next time not to back too many younger politicians who'll never get automatic promotion by age. 
One of those games that left me keen for more.

Hilarious fluff text in a chaotic political mayhem game. This game features many serious mechanics for its age, or for today, even. However long term planning from AP players should be discouraged here. I dare say I could only play this as a fun party game, although it is clear it's not one. This combination of political medium-heavy rules and chaotic-party game results was not well accepted.

This game is all about theme and laughs. Or laughs and theme.
If you take it seriously, it fails miserably: if you bid all your influence on the wrong people, you have no chance at all; if you roll miserably, you have no chance.
The key part to understand is that this game is all about the experience, not the win: with the right group it can be a blast! Who doesn't desire to send some opponent to Siberia?!?

Our house rules are: 1) You have to refer to everyone as "Comrade" 2) When the Party Chief dies (by natural or unnatural causes) all people are obligated to sing "Kiss Him Goodbye" by Steam (at least the "Na na na na, na na na na, hey hey, goodbye" part) 3) When the Party Chief successfully waves, we play the Russian anthem (the waver has 13 variations to choose from).

Ahh, Kremlin. I think Kremlin is a super fun, yet deep, backstabbing game that I literally think about and want to play every day. Unfortunately for me, my group HATED it! Could it be that I won the 2 games in year 6 and 7? Maybe. If there's anyone in Palm Beach or Martin County Fl that wants to play, let me know!! Well, I lost my third game but I still love it. Best set up, Revolution characters without the special cards but with the replacement rules (flip historical figures over when they die). Still looking to trade for something really good, make me an offer!

One play, with 3 players and basic rules.  I cannot recommend playing this game in this way - it seems trials are useless and purges control the game, and controlling the Party Chief and KGB Head is a near-unbreakable hammerlock, excepting unfortunate luck.  And oh, yes, there is a surfeit of luck.  Possibly fun in the right frame of mind, right group, and/or with more players.

Sure, Kremlin shows its age: not only because of its light humor and theme but, from the modern gamer’s point of view, also because it plays in a clumsy way, as poor rolls are the only solution to most situations.

Yet there are reasons to get it to the table now and then beside dusting the box: it’s funny and a huge leap back to a time when games and gamers didn’t take themselves too seriously.

By the third round is when I really started to see how the game worked and how to work the game.  I'm hoping to get to play this one again to help decide if it's a 6 or 7.  I found the aging and the hidden influence fun and appropriate for a game like this.  

Update: Okay, I made it a 7.  It took awhile but I didn't realize all that much as it was fun.  We had lots of nasty tricks, surprises.  Again, because it had been awhile, it took me a little to get back in the swing.  So, I bumped it to a 7.  Like to get back to this again within a couple of months.  The bits in this one are rough because of being fiddly.  Some home brewed bits would be nice (less fiddly) but not sure what.

All right.... Kontrol the Kremlin!  Exert all of the seedy intrigue and corruption to have your favorite Russian politician wave at the annual parade.  Thats right, manage to wave at the parade 3 times and guess what... you win!!

That is correct.  Have your chain smoking drunken crook stumble onto stage by whatever means you can. Try to exert influence on votes maybe, or land someone else in Siberia perhaps, or maybe have them put on trial for corruption, or the favorite of favorites...send a fellow member of the Politburo off to....the sanitarium!!!


This is a crazy game.  It is hilarious to play with the right people and a great game to spring on an unsuspecting wargamer that can't handle tricky rules and anything other than linear rules systems.

This game takes about 90 minutes to play and is well done enough to be considered neat looking for its time but by no means lovely.  This game is FUN!

One of my all time favorites.  Game lasts 2 hours max!  Good with 3, 4, 5, or 6 players.  Truly vicious and fast paced - one we keep coming back to!    Great if all players are of the same experience level or varying as long as you have at least two experienced players. Don't bother with the basic game, the advanced game just adds strong and weak positions and the intrigue cards.  The cards allow for lots of nasty surprises and are a must (to the extent we didn't even try the basic game!)!!  Use the assasin card to kill of one of your own guys (perhaps) but use him to frame someone else since you only need to roll a 12 to succeed - even if you blame the party chief!

Clunky game, with way too much luck involved for turns you're supposed to think about.  I'd rather play King Me! or something similiar.  I like the theme and wanted to like the game.. but the randomness and the tiebreaker rules just annoyed me.

Holy crap was this game bad!  As soon as you thought a decision was resolved, someone could interrupt by placing more influence, slowing the whole game down to a crawl.  Add to that the enormous amount of downtime where you have absolutely nothing to do and you have a game that I'd never want to play again.  For such a random game, there's just too much downtime and it's too long.  I think I'd have died if there wasn't a TV to watch during the game.

Wonderful game! We were rolling all over the carpet and had a terrific time. (Once played to date.) Can't wait to have another go.

Some might count it as a fault of the game that a player walking away from the board and only coming back when victory is determined can win (albeit pretty unlikely). Doesn't diminish my appreciation of the game however. This game rocks! 

The component and graphics quality isn't what we're used to, but the caricatures are fun.

Have to look out for more such hierarchical political games. I love the concept. Definitely must get Junta played some day in our group as I sadly haven't had a chance to have a go at that one.

I don't care how fiddly this is---it's a fantastic, fantastic game. I do NOT enjoy teaching this game at all (and therefore it hardly ever sees the table), but with a group that knows the game well it is a romp of manipulation and back-stabbing. I wish someone would re-issue it with tighter mechanics. 

05/2010: Just brought out after years of gathering dust. WHAT A BLAST! Ok, it took really long (3+ hours) and we were all tired---but what a riot. CURSE YOU SERGI EATSTOOMUCH, my evil zombie nemesis that I could never get rid of no matter how many times I tried and seemed to succeed. Fortunately, I'm much better at teaching games now so this wasn't nearly as hard as it had been in the past with new players. Unfortunately for me, I gave too much basic strategy away in preparing everyone for the blood bath and I ended up losing every IP tie, but I had a great time. A few complained there was too much luck, but it's just the right amount to keep hope alive for the players without any power. Otherwise, the game would stagnate and bog down and the have-nots would never see a glimmer of hope in all the chaos.

Satiro pri la eks-Soveta Politburoo. 

Simpla ludo-sistemo : la ludantoj metas sekretan influon sur individuaj politikuloj, kiuj per balotoj povas ricevi promocion aŭ male perdi sian rangon. 

Strategie la ludo aspektas Diplomation, sed ekzistas distra elemento de hazardo : ĉiu politikulo instigas (sed ankaŭ riskas) areston, ideologian enketon, ekzilo al Siberio,...

Sed la plej interesa elemento de la ludo ests "streso", ĉar ĉiu politika manovro kostas unu-du jarojn da plusa aĝo. Ekzemple, dum ideologia enketo  fare de la KGB - Komitato pri Ŝtata Sekureco – ne nur la viktimo sed ankaŭ la KGB-estro maljuniĝas unu-du jarojn. Relativa aĝo estas do ĉefa elemento, ĉar ĉiun jaron la Politburoanoj devas sperti "sankontrolon", kiun la plej ŝarĝitaj ofte ne travivas.

What a fantastic game! I've only played the basic rules, but I'm looking forward to more plays. 

The theme is a bit dated, these days, and the components could use a nice update...but the core of the game itself is pure genious. The hidden influence and interacting roles makes for a fun and cagey battle of bluff and counter-bluff. 

Also nice is the play time, if all the players are familiar with the game. 

In the Shadow of the Emperor has some similarities to Kremlin, but without the hidden information. If you want to play a similarly themed game, but with more room for surprises and clever play (and less king-making), try Kremlin.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
I like everything about this game except for the central mechanism that drives the action.

Kremlin is a heavily themed political / influence game designed by Urs Hostettler, who is perhaps best known on BGG for his card games (Tichu, Cosmic Eidex). Kremlin is an older school Euro style game that was published by Avalon Hill and a number of other companies.

The idea is this: there are a number of politicians who you can gain influence in. The higher-ups have powers which generally involve sending people off to Siberia. All of them age and otherwise get sick. The idea is to have the most influence in the leader at the end of the round, and to successfully get them to wave in a parade, which is automatic if they aren't sick, but which requires a roll if they aren't.

There are other things here, but that is the heart of the game. The central mechanism that I referred to is the way one gets influence in a politician: most of it is decided before the game and secretly jotted down on a sheet. During the game, players can freely reveal some or all of their influence in a politician to try to take control of them and use them to do things like demote/promote, pack bags for them to Siberia, or to otherwise cause mischief. 

This is THE core mechanic of the game. On the good side, it creates really entertaining slow reveal sequences where players each jostle back and forth, slowly revealing their influence in the character. It also creates uncertainty, and clever obfuscation can easily win the game. On the down side, it's a real crap shoot. It is easy to put your numbers in all of the wrong spots, and end up with no influence on anyone of import, and if that happens, there isn't much you can do in the game, at all. In theory, there are ways to bleed influence out of a guy (i.e.: get people to reveal, send him packing, bring him back, promote him) but it requires some serious hoop jumping AND influence in someone else of moderate importance. Personally, I don't mind high stakes battles, but when they are mostly decided before the game, with no real way of knowing what the other people are up to, then it irks me.

I like the theme and the powers that are present here, but that influence picking thing is maddening, and it is what pulls this game's rating down for me.

I've only played it once as a playtest of a friend's variant (which replaces the influence sheet with influence cards). While the game shows its age and heritage in some of the mechanisms used (notably the lookup charts) it was still for the most part an enjoyable game. I enjoyed the humour employed in the game and it would be interesting to see what a modern publisher would do with the graphic design nowadays. It was fun to put on the bad russian accents and get into some Soviet era political wrangling. I was fortunate enough to win the game in four rounds as I'm not sure how I would have felt had it gone the full 10 rounds. The luck factor is also seems pretty significant in the game. Still enjoyable for what it is and I'd love to see a modern adaptation.

An all time classic from back in the good old Avalon Hill days. It is essentially a hidden influence game with a strong element of backstabbing and negotiations. Yes, there is a lot of randomness, but comparisons to a shit heap game like Munchkin makes me laugh. If you can't handle a little chaos go slink back to your Puerto Rico and Caylus game for your "perfect information" fill. It will leave more room at the table for the fun players.

We played the hell out of this in college and recently started playing again. I forgot what a joy this game is. This is total backstabbing good times!

Avalon Hill.  Really neat, original game for power politics inside Moscow during the cold war.  This game plays great with 4 players.  The game plays with zero down time and is a fun, intense exercise in working the system to get to the top and "wave" at Red Square each turn.  Personally, this is a great game and one that predates most euro based games - although it is not quite a euro style game.  Kremlin plays in around 3-4 hours.

Aging Politburo members stabbing each other in the back and vying for control while dying at an alarming rate.  The theme of Kremlin is fun and you can get some fairly involved strategies going, but the mechanics sometimes leads to situations where the majority of players just simply can't do anything.  When this happens on their first game, they usually don't want to play it again because it was not much fun.  But when the game actually doesn't break, it's a hoot.  I have never tried the intrigue cards, so perhaps I'll try those out before I render a final judgement.

An oft-overlooked classic, Kremlin is one of the first "Euro" games seen in the U.S. (albeit published by AH).  A diabolically clever game of hidden interest in various members of the Kremlin, where exercising one's power comes at the cost of revealing your interests, thus making them more vulnerable.

A great game with a morbid sense of humor. Sometimes, you can find yourself in a very difficult possition early on if you put your influence in bad places (as I always do), but I find the game fun, even when I know I won't win. The names of the politicians are great. They have an expansion with real russian names, but I'll take the fake names any day.

The event cards didn't seem as though they added enough to the game; either in terms of playability or fun but I belive the event cards were introduced in the expansion.  Maybe ten rounds is a bit much but whe you play more often this probably works out fine.  We played with 5 players which was ok but we thought 4 players would probably be the sweet spot. I am rating this a 6 but it was a lot of fun so it isn't far off a 7.

Intrigue, politics.

Each player secretly nominates 10 persons and gives them influence from 1 to 10.

Catches theme well, slowish, somewhat much little mechanics that need handling but easy to learn

I really enjoy this game for the pure amusement value.  Should be played quickly; as a 'heavy' play of the game detracts from the minimal strategy really there.

Does the Kremlin Chief have a change of heart?  Once, twice? roll..."

A game of political intrigue that has a strong theme and a good sense of humour.

A blast from the past, this one. It's got a lot of interesting elements in it and was probably ahead of its time in its day, but feels awfully dated now. I have a friend who likes to pull out these old Avalon Hill titles, and they usually suck because they're so out of date (Age of Renaissance, Rail Baron, Air Baron). This one was kind of fun, but with all the great options in our hobby, I don't see the point of devoting a couple of hours to this heavily luck-based title for as long as it is.

Besides, I should probably never play again anyway after the success of my first play. I had a huge case of beginner's luck and had the perfect Kremlin game.  My guys came out perfectly when and where I needed them, my die rolls hit, it was perfect, and I won easily. Never get that alignment of the stars again!

RATING: 8
Disappointing.  I was expecting a light-hearted Republic of Rome with ridiculous accents.  But in Soviet Russia, game plays you!

Sorry.  But the game takes waaaaay too long for what it is.  The theme is undeniably fun, but the game feels long in the tooth.  I felt like half the game time was spent rolling to see who dies.  It's dramatic, but I feel like a RoR-style chit draw has just as much drama, and takes a whole lot less time. 

The heavy bookkeeping and tedious activity may function as oblique commentary on the game's subject matter, but mechanically, it could really use an update.  I'd rate it much lower if it weren't so goddamned entertaining anyway.

I bought and sold this never having been able to get it to the table. I would so loved to have, though! What a great concept, what a stellar production (in the latest edition, it must have been). Yes it's surely long and fiddly like older games, but I'd still love to play it. And yes, I'd also like to try Nothing Personal, given that it seems like a more modern version of Kremlin. But as much as the mafia theme is surely fun, I love the original political theme.

RATING: 7
Jugada una partida al juego básico. Me ha parecido un juego que aguanta perfectamente sus muchos años de edad. Muy divertido y caotico, pero con un componente sencillo de estrategía y planificación para ganar la partida.

Es muy importante que los jugadores asuman sus roles, y pongan voz y gestos de viejos miembros de la "nomenclatura"...

Complemento ideal después de un buen Twilight Struggle.

Pd.- Vuelto a jugar con las reglas avanzadas, el juego no varia en sus premisas fundamentales. Las cartas le dan un pequeño toque de incertidumbre, limitada por las pocas que se manejan en una partida normal. Los puntos fuertes y débiles de los políticos tampoco parecen tener una importancia decisiva, así como la posibilidad de poner mayor influencia. En definitiva, es preferible jugar a la versión avanzada directamente, pues no aumenta la dificultad prácticamente, y si dota de unas leves posibilidades a mayores para intentar seguir una estrategía.

Pd.- Vuelto a jugar con 6 jugadores, reglas avanzadas y cartas compatibles de la expansión Revolution, el juego gana mucho en diversión y posibilidades estratégicas, porque hay muchas más posibilidades de vuelco de situación al haber muchas más cartas en juego, y muchas más influencias ocultas, además, las nuevas cartas del revolutión son mucho más poderosas que las clásicas, y pueden dar la vuelta una situación que parezca indestructible. Además, las votaciones ganan muchos enteros y no es ya tan fácil saber quien va a ganar o perder, hay muchas sorpresas.  Le subo la nota a un 7,5 y no más por la excesiva duración (4 horas o +) que presenta el juego a 6.

The end of the Cold War made this game somewhat obsolete, but if you can get a few old timers together who remember the Wall, this is a great, fun, tongue in cheek look at the old Soviet Union.

Fiddly in the extreme, overly long with extended stretches of boredom. There just doesn't seem to be any real decisions to make and keeping quiet sometimes is the better option - except that it then gives you NO decisions to make.

The fiddly-ness just brings the whole experience to a crawl. Dice rolls and look up charts in what should be a fun, social game? No thanks. Constantly looking up who you invested influence in? Hmm.

We played the first edition Res Brandenberger version. Possibly newer versions have streamlined things and smoothed out these bumps.....but I have no inclination to find out.

There is something there but it needs to be super-streamlined into a half hour game. That could be a fun, Coup-like affair.

Kremlin is a very mixed bag. On one hand the theme is hilarious, and the twists and turns of political schemeing and backroom conspiracies do a good job to keep it fresh, on the other hand it often tends to run a bit too long, with some bad luck it's possible you simply have to sit out for quite while, and the production is pretty shoddy.

I love this game. It just doesn't get played - seems a bit out of date. But, when we have played it, we've had a blast. We've been itching to get it back to the table. The bluffing and backstabbing make for high turn angst.
And the reason it doesn't get played - just too fiddly! Way too fiddly compared to the typical German game. We played a 3 1/2 hour game and were STILL following a cheat sheet to work through every single turn. 10 phases to a turn (just too much) and lots of fiddly little rules for each phase. Despite that, it's fun. I really love it, but will be hard pressed to ever play it again. (10/21/06) 
Played it again on July 31, 2009. We again loved it, thought it took nearly 3 hours to play.

As for its originality, this games merits an 8. The theme is well implemented if not full of black humour - at least I seem to laugh a lot during the session. :)

Yet, the BGG rating system takes into account what I feel today, and only what I'd like to play more often, which is a fickle rating at best. 
I feel that due to the length of this game, and its convoluted mechanics I wouldn't want to play it very often, but only when the occasion, the people and the time are right for it to hit the table. 

Thus the rating. Sorry for that.

Update (10/01/11): This is one of those OOP AH classics. I recall the play being mildly interesting, but that failure or success centered around how well I could roll a d20. If I rolled well, some higher-ranking politburo member would die off, and I could then advance one of my cronies. I've heard it is similar to Junta, which may be a better, more modern implementation of this mechanic. I guess I could take it or leave it at this point.

Kremlin is very, very Junta-esque (not surprising given the designers) which would tank my rating if not for the omission of a few things.  The game is mercifully shorter.  It's still two hours and some change but it's fun enough to not really feel it until the end.  Like Junta there is lots of chaos, randomness, fiddliness, turn phase accounting, and a general sense of roughness.  This game, like its sibling, is the enemy of elegance.  Most of the game seems to be waiting for the right moment to strike and hanging along for the ride in the meantime.  I know people who love this, but I can think of better ways to spend my time.

My rating is mostly due to the fact that I just really didn't like this game. It's not for me at all. I hate games where you have to maneuver for power and deal with intrigue probably because I suck at games like that. That's probably the chief reason I didn't like it. So I am probably being really unfair to this game since I am judging it on whether I liked it or not. It's probably really a good game.

A classic, but it stands modern games and mechanics, and is as fun as the funnier actual game.

Then starts the chaos!

SOLD A game that has a lot of potential if it weren't so ridiculously fiddly. The current board uses alot of small print to guide the game play which isn't easy to read and colour design is a bit poor.
Overall the idea behind the game is fantastic and I enjoyed playing it but handling chits by the gazillion can get a bit tedious. I know Kickstarter reprint of this game is in the works but it sounds like they will repeat the faults of the predecessor. The design could be improved immensely with a bit of thought. Too bad ...

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
In my humble opinion, this magnificent game is a eurogame before birth the term. I love the high interactivity between players and the mystery of not knowing who really controls the politicians. Kremlin is essentially a influence game with special action cards topped off with a suprisingly rich theme. The game captures a great sense of Soviet political manuevering, intrigue, and treachery. Ship rival politicians to Siberia, conduct KGB investigations, promote your candidates, and get old or sick.

RATING: 4
Amusing and fun to imagine, but the dry play and luck drag it down. The support concept is pretty cool, but there's very little GAME here. And no, I'm not still bitter that I would have won my first (and only) round at Avaloncon had someone not rolled the 18 or better to purge my leader. ;D

The game was a "6 rating" game in my mind until we got to the very end.  It turned into an absolute kingmaker situation.  Since it was only one play, I only downgraded it one point for that.  I almost rated it a 4.  Early in the game, I was in great shape: I had a lock on a relatively young party leader and also control of the defense minister.  I made health rolls of 3 and 2, and both died in the same turn.  Surprisingly, that didn't ruin it for me as the kingmaker thing at the end did.

Not the most intuitive game (you'll hate your first game or three), but good with experienced players. At game start, you secretly assign influence points against Soviet politicians, with the game play revolving around maneuvering your favoured politicians to the top of the pile while trying to relocate  opponents' politcians to the sanitarium or the gulag. A lot of it goes on underneath the surface - when do you declare your interest in a politician by advancing his cause, knowing that to do so will only encourage the others to hasten his KGB-led progression to the gulag?

The first time we played this, it didn't go very smoothly, and I could tell everyone was getting exasperated with the game. It's a LOT more fiddly than I expected it to be, even having mentally made allowances for all the updating of politicians' ages with the little chits. 

It seemed like people were confused about how exactly to go about accomplishing the goal, and influence was revealed rapidly, which is the opposite of what even the game's rules suggest. 

There is a game in here that I'm pretty sure I will like, but I guess I need to study up on the rules to get each of the game's phases down pat, and be able to explain how (and why) you do things in each phase. Control of the KGB Head and Defense Minister ought to have been much more important than we were treating it in our game.

Increadibly thematic game. Very humoristic, and for us who grew up in the 70s and 80s the old-timer theme is spot-on. The gameplay itself is very old fasioned and no so streamlined as for example Power Struggle. The worst thing about this game is that there seem to be very little straegy involved (after a first play), but I must admit that I really enjoyed the experience.

RATING: 8
Quite possibly the most intriguing game I have ever played.  The secret bid/influence mechanic is genius and creates high tension.  It’s everything King Me wanted to be and everything In the Shadow of the Emporer couldn’t be (not to say SotE is a bad game).  This game is truly a work of genius.

Players secretly note influence on 10 politicians in the Cold War era Soviet Union.  The politicians are influenced by the players to do certain actions (accusing other politicians of espionage [potentially exiling them to Siberia], pardoning them, reshuffling the politburo, etc... Actions cause the politicians to age and health rolls can sometimes make them sick or die. At the end of each turn, the reigning head of state must wave to the crowd at the October parade without collapsing (which gets harder the sicker the politician is).  A politician who succeeds in this three times makes the player who controls him/her the winner.  A fun game with few in its class.  I have the original Avalon Hill version.

A Eurogame before there were Eurogames.  It always winds up in the car when heading off to a games afternoon with friends, and always winds up getting played at least once.

What's to love about Kremlin?
* Easy to learn, few rules - players can pick up the rules (and win on their first attempt) after observing only a single turn or two.
* Great theme - who doesn't like silly accents?
* Fast playing - can play multiple games in a single sitting, or use it as the opening game of the day while awaiting others to arrive.  
* Little or no down time - your brain is going to be always on the go.
* Sure there's stabbing, but it all happens quickly, and the game theme is light-hearted, so I've never seen someone bearing a grudge.  You can always get them back later in the evening.

But...
* Like many games, Kremlin is only at its best with at least 4 players playing FTF IRL.  As with Diplomacy, part of the subtlety of the game comes from trying to interpret others' subconscious cues to deduce who their stooges are.

Awesome game of backstabbing.  You never know if you really control a politician!  This needs a reprint with new art and board, but sadly, that probably will never happens. 

*UPDATE*  Well, the reprint happened!  Sadly, after we tried it, we found the board to be a let down.  this is a fun game, so why is the board so dark and depressing...and the logo problem at the top of the board hiding some important text is really annoying. We're also not really fan of the pictures style.  As such, we use the old board, old picture and the new political action cards.  So, it got reprinted, yay!, but the art direction is a big fail.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

It wasn't a good first impression but at least I learned the rules. Our game lasted 3 rounds only as no one did enough to remove the president from office either turn. However, someone thought it important to remove my two guys and put them in Siberia even though they were lowly members of the Party. Yeah, a bit bitter. I don't know if I want to play again or not. The guess work involved in choosing your 10 guys to influence and not knowing how they might come out is not always ideal. I only had two of my guys come out early and the other two came out in the final round which made no difference whatsoever.

Very interesting game of bluffing, misdirection and political control.  This game seems to stand somewhere between most traditional hobby American games and the more streamlined Euros that would develop in the 90's.  I enjoy the way in which the various politicians in the Politburo manage to affect the other members and the decisions that one must make when placing influence and taking one's actions each turn.  The game is unfortunately a bit long but not terribly so especially in light of its age.

RATING: 8
The game is a political struggle simulation inside the Soviet Politurbo. The objective of the game is for the different political factions to have their faction delegate being the Head of the Politurbo who can "wave" three times consecutively during the yearly parade outside the Kremlin palace.  Each political figures are depicted in cards with ages going up every year.  Inside the Politurbo, there are different positions like KGB, Police Chief, Head of the Ministry of Economy and Industry, etc represented by different slots, within a triangular shape of authority. Health conditions of the politurbo members can become increasingly deteriorated as a function over time and special operations targeted by the enemy faction.  Alliances made and broken as players can make dirty deals, backstabbing or bribes among themselves with every possibilities.  The game is simple, fun and intense and, most treasured of all, it can be played in just an evening.  Great game play value.

Kickstarted... Got it! (2014-06-05) The shipping box was soaking wet, argh, but.. the game inside, *dry*!

Don't like the chits which have different numbers on each side. This is confusing to store.

...wish more time had been spent on the rules than on the bio blurbs of the politicians... still no PDF of the latest rules online, which is unfortunate for a new game which will need so much work and study up front to be playable.

So, we plan to use the Avalon Hill rules instead of the problematic rules in the box. Will figure out any extra rules in the new edition another time, like 'exiling'.

At one time this was a grail game I had decided to give up on. I'm so happy JR decided to reprint this, and despite a few production issues, the game is really great.

I've played modern games such as Power Struggle or Tribune, but nothing quite this cutthroat. The only downside I've seen is the three rules sets. Our first play was with the "original" rules. Looking at the other two sets I can definitely see why no one really plays with any of the three, much less the same set of rules as each other. I like that you can easily pick and choose what you like, play with it, and the core experience never changes; that's the sign of good design.

I look forward to many more plays.

I love this game. With most groups of people, this game becomes very engrossing and fun without degrading to a total luck-fest. To win you must play other people against each other while advancing your politicians without calling attention to yourself. But you don't even know if 'your' politician is really yours! It requires subtlety and negotiating without being too deep or long of a game.

An old AH game that shows its age much like the politburo politicians in the game.  It takes far too long to play for what it is but I do love the pyramid mechanic where politicians climb the communist party ladder to be General Secretary.  

The game can end quickly, which is good, but I can see this game taking hours.  There are more modern games that reimplement the pyramid mechanic better like Nothing Personal and Viceroy

Love the mechanic of pulling strings while no one really knows who has the upper hand in the end.  Also, who wouldn't love sending people off to Siberia? I mean, come on.  It's the Russian dream.  Or so I can only assume.  But definitely a great game for 3+; plays best with 4 or 5 though.  Gets more people involved and really doesn't slow the game down that much since all the turns are scripted by phase and the people simply assert control of figures in various phases.

I have mixed feelings about Kremlin after my 1 play.  I really like the integration of the theme, and I found myself laughing aloud at several points during the game.  My experience was degraded by a bad die roll.  I'm concerned that the individual die rolls affect play too much.  Normally die rolls will even out over the course of a game, but not sure there were enough of them in this one to even out.  I was (effectively) knocked out early, so my view might be skewed in this regard.  I expect my rating would go up or down 1/2 a point with subsequent plays.  I'd be happy to play this game again, but probably won't suggest it.

Probably gets better with more experience, but I found it dull once the initial few turns were over and I had no Politburo members in play.

What a fun game!  Only for people who lived through and remember the 80's, or watching Bresnev staggering at the podium.  German-style gamers complain it's 'fiddly', but I like 'fiddly'.

29/4/2014  Just played an awesome game of kremlin: it actually went the distance, the first time that has happened.  three players had two waves (only I failed to get even one!), we had an untimely death with a '1' roll to off the third chance of one player, and a '2' roll to off the chance of a second player.  We had a failed third wave attempt, lots of purges, wild events... this is how the game was meant to be played!

Fun retro-y take on the USSR!  Like the secret influence on the party 'heads', especially the option to only reveal partially how much you have.  Repeated plays help you develop a sneakier strategy.  The USSR theme really lends itself well, though, and in today's day is a great ironic take on everything.

Not for me, I think. Clever design but based on your initial point distribution you can be already eliminated from the start. Also, it seems to take quite a while before one person manages to wave three times, not even talking about making sure that your guy waves three times.

Very thematic game that hits a bullseye at what it wants to be. Sort of a hybrid. Mechanics of a euro but with a lot of cutthroat interaction and a strong historical theme. 

New Jolly Roger version is very true to the original Avalon Hill version but with much better components. If you ever want to do a communist themed game night this is the first game that should hit the table.

An old classic which is basically a worker-placement game with the nice twist that the owner of each 'worker' can change with the influence concept.

However the game feels outdated in design and gameflow and will likely only appeal for its nostalgic value or its pure mechanics.

RATING: 7
Not so much new as rediscovered after a 20+ year hiatus. I had always remembered this as a fun game, but in a recent play I really enjoyed it a lot more than I expected.

I had great time plotting and scheming with my Stalinists while cheering the death of the old men at the top as my pawns ascended the party's cursus honorum.

An excellent parody of the Andropov era (how many games can say that?) and a lot of fun to boot. Well worth trying if you get a chance.

Update - I backed the Kickstarter.  How could I not?

Overall fun and very original theme.  But the game is a bit too chaotic and too long for my taste, plus IMO it suffers from the fact that it is completely possible through pure bad luck to be out of the game already in turn 1.  By this I mean that if you chose the same characters to influence as other people, and that other people always have more influence than you, you'll invariable be left with an almost unwinable position.

Boardgame based on spoofing the Russian political system. Secretly assign points to politicians on the board, then try to advance them to become chief. You can attempt to make accusations, send other politicians to Sibera, etc. Politicians age according to the actions they make. Only played once, the names of the politicians were funny. Theme is good, but gameplay was not too inspiring. Preliminary rating of 6, but I haven't played enough to make a valid opinion.

RATING: 4.5
Political intrigue game that presents a comical view of the cold war Russia. Fun, negotiation, backstabbing, intrigue, interesting theme, and bluffing at its finest. The game mechanics are old, but they have survived well.

It's not a short game for new players (2+ hours), and you have to be quite veteran to be able to rreduce the playing time considerably.

Quite replayable. Each game will be different, but most likely, strateggies will be carried over.

You can start doomed if the politics you choose are outbidden by other players. A big deal of the final result is the result of the blind act of choosing politics. If this is the case, not only you will not have any chance to win, but also you will do very little.

Luck also plays a big factor, sometimes a huge factor.

The main problem is that you will only be active during part of the game. You will have to keep a low profile and not show your cards if you want to have chances at the second or third part of the game, or you can start hard and burn your ships at the beginning. You will do very little to nothing during the rest of the game. And considering that this is a long game (2'5 hours unless expert), this 

If you have bad luck (my case in my 2 first games), you will do nothing in the whole game.

There's also the winning combo: you need to control the Party Leader and the KGB Head, and you will be untouchable for sometime. You just need luck to avoid injuries and further death and if they are not very old, it will be a walk in the park. In fact, this is the only way we managed to get points in both games.

The bureocracy is also quite taxing. Too much rolling and adding numbers to reflect age changing.

So, in a few words: great idea, clever mechanics, funnny theme and funnny moments during the gameplay too, but it's way too long for a game that will be decided by luck (in a great mesure), and way too long considering the very few things you will actually do (some times, you could do nothing at all during the whole game).

I think this game has not aged well. Those defects were not that important at the time, but they are unbearable now.

I reduce my initial and hopeful 7.5 to a more realistic 6, and I don't think I will be willing to play it again in a few years.

RATING: 2
First impression: Never played but I watched a half game. Theme seems very different and quite fun.

Update after playing the game with 5 players: It was fun but that was more thanks to players than the game. In the game I managed to outplay myself totally out from the game in setup + doing 1 mistake in early game. If you manage to choose always values 1-2 lower than someone else you're royally screwed. So, I spend rest of two hours (5 rounds out of 9 and then we had to quit) just rolling the dice. One of the funniest things during game was the distribution that for the most part would've been normal on D10, not D20... That and table talk in general was fun. BUT...

Components of the 1. edition sucked badly. You constantly have to modify ages and/or add "bids" on characters and pieces for this are crappy. Moving the characters around the board is fiddly too. It is pretty chaotic and random too even though dice rolls are pretty predictable (hah!). There is plenty of downtime for some players at least. How much players "play" can vary very much (sometimes it is voluntary choice as it can be beneficial to hide your influence) and in general there seems to be quite a few meaningful choices to be made during game. Most are little choices that really don't affect that much since the outcome of the game can easily be decided on lucky roll on Autumn parade...

Oh yes, I didn't like it too much.

Got a rules intro before we all decided it wasn't the right game for that group at that time.

Very clever and humorous game about Soviet politics. The randomization of character cards into offices would add a lot of replayability. 

Unfortunately (for me), the game is about majorities, bluffing/deception, and screwage. It also seems rather complicated (perhaps higher than the 2.8 weight), and if it went the predicted "couple hours", that would be too long. I could be talked into playing a 30-45 minute filler based on this, occasionally.

It's the USSR made fun!  I love the influence mechanics, the scheming, the plotting, the sending someone who's a pain in the butt off to Siberia.

Kremlin is a thoroughly enjoyable, eminently playable game that is both heavy on strategy and interaction while feeling lighter and evoking much laughter from the players.  I'd actually been looking for a copy of this game for years and finally managed to snag one on eBay.

Can't wait to get it on the table.

Mmmmmm, 1st play of this not impressive.  6p, 3 hour length in a game I feel should be ~1 hour.

Board was initially set up with younger politicos and I made mistake of plugging too much influence there and not much at all in ones below (in people stack).  I was really out of the game after first 90 minutes & really no options for remaining 90.  

At very end of game, P had two waves, John 2 and P2 two and Kenny one, but when P was jostled out of Party leader at last minute-he played a card that killed the entire board basically (flu?) which auto promoted Dan (who had zero waves, like me) in as the winner???

I understand that was a fluke, but still, wayyyyy too random for my tastes.  Wouldn't be as bad if only ~1hour game. 

2nd play was much better

I was expecting more from this game than 3 HOURS of really bad accents. That joke got old in 10 minutes.

It's odd how a game can last 3 hours or finish just after a 1/2 hour! When played in the right mood its a nice game.

This classic Avalon Hill game is a clever game that reminds me a little of horse-betting games, except that the "horses" are Soviet politicians and the "race" is the power structure within the politburo.  Before the game, each player secretly assigns influence to each of 26 politicians, which they can reveal at any time to try to take control of that politician and whatever office he occupies.  The goal is to control the party chief for three turns--no easy feat when everyone else is trying to bring you down.  Politicians can age and die or be sent to Siberia on their way to the top.  This is a very clever game, and one of the best of its time.

The theme of the game is really great (if you're into the Soviet system at all -- I am ...), but the rule book is terrible with far too many critical rules unclear or missing, as well as very poorly organized rules (seriously, even the set up is scattered all over the manual). Also, while I appreciate the historical fidelity, whether or not the 1928 version of this will be fun and/or competitive is almost entirely based on chance (the initial investment of influence being done blindly before knowing how politicians will be distributed across the board). Because I love the theme of the game I doubt I will let this go any time soon, but, I'm having trouble imagining any scenario that would convince my friends to play it with me again.

Incredibly well implemented, immersive theme.

What sucks, though, is that there's a lot of waiting in the game if you none of your politicians are in the Politburo -- or they might be there; you're just letting someone to the work for you. Personally, I don't like games in which passing is a viable and important option; I want to do something every turm.

Yes, the game is incredibly fiddly, and the components of the Fata Morgana version, which I own, is utterly crappy, but that I can easily forgive because Kremlin is such a unique, political game.

Players secretly allocate influence to 10 politicians, then disclose this influence strategically. By disclosing that you influence a politician more than your opponents, you control him and his office, allowing you to do things like promote and demote others, accuse rivals of espionage, send them to Siberia, determine how to manage aging and illness, and eventually work your controlled characters up to party chief (doing so in three years can win the game), all while managing stress points, a currency that can eventually cause your characters to drop out of the running.

Fata Morgana Edition: Usually is a fun game that for some reason brings out the role-players in our group. Unfortunately has the potential of screwing a player seriously, effectively putting him out of the game for 2 hours+. Happened to me last game when my 10, 9 and 8 influence guys either died (Doberman at 63) or ended up in Siberia early, preventing me from getting into a position where I could actually do something for most of the game.
Will only play again if threatened with Monopoly instead.

RATING: 7
Needs a short rules "cheet sheet" to sit in front of the players. With experienced players there's a lot more bluffing going on. With the right players this game is a hoot. With others it falls flat. A case of the fun being brought to the table by the players appreciating the fun in the game.

Too much hangs on the roll of the 20 sided dice to make it a truly great game. Great system overall though.

Looking forward to the new Jolly Roger Games version. I like what I hear.

The last of the Great Three from Avalon Hill, and clearly the "best" "game" of the three, which isnt saying much I suppose.  It's so dated now - almost a period piece.  But, it's very unique and was always good for a laugh.  I wonder if I'll ever play it again?

Ah, I've missed Kremlin. I have the original Avalon Hill edition. The secret and gradually revealed bids is fantastic, where you have to balance between exerting control over a politician and hiding your true depth of influence. Add to this the different powers given to different Politburo offices, and you have a unique game experience each time. Plus the politician cards are kinda funny. But it's chaos, total chaos. If you're not speaking in accents you're not trying hard enough.

Played twice and enjoyed it very much. There did seem to be a "problem" with someone getting into the top spot and not being able to wave for some reason, but no one could get them out. Very fun and flavorful however. I didn't realize until recently that it was actually a German game brought over by AH.

RATING: 4
Game has some fun elements to it, but it's very easy to end up doing nothing for a large part of the game.  Slow moving, we played with 5 and it took us 6+ hours to finish a game.  Typical old school AH game, complicated rules, poorly written making things difficult to understand, had to go back and re-read parts numerous times.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I love nearly everything about this game except the VP system. You have to work extremely hard to become the president, and are usually old and sick by then, which makes it nearly impossible to score as the range of successful numbers you need to roll on your one chance of a single D20 roll gets smaller and smaller. With modified VP rules, this could become a favorite game for me.

RATING: 6
[1 play] Let me say right off the bat that I don't think a 6 player game is a shining introductory experience for this old game. I also think there is the beating heart of a good game here, but that, like the bodies of the aged Politburo members within, a cure is needed. Perhaps someone can remake this someday and bring it to life again.

Anyway, we have a fun group and we had a good time with the theme, but it is klunky to play, a bit too random to feel like you control your fate in any strong manner, and ultimately many of the players are wacked out of contention by the random whims of other players wild guesses. I'd like to try it again with fewer players sometime, but I won't be pushing it to the front myself most likely.

Most recent play 12-19-09 with Joel, Carter, Brian P, Michael, and Garrett.

This has a special place in my heart because I played it as a kid.  That said, it kind of, sort of, holds up (with the wee exception that it's basically unwinable and the winner is pretty random).  Still the core idea of gently nudging officials along in a bureaucracy is wonderful and I haven't seen it anywhere else.

RATING: 8
One of my favorite, dropped down to eight after years but still great game. Secret deployment of control points in Soviet politburo and struggle for power in the Party. Fun and thrill this is what this game is about. You never know if you really control the member you want control and when you finally knows he maybe be as good as dead at that time :).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is undoubtedly a classic.  This is really a fine system, there is the tough call of throwing down all of your points in hopes that your race to a tie may push you into control of a character or to hold out and see if you get beat and then send dude to siberia, now you keep your points and the other points are wipped clean.  Many fun twists and turns and one of the few games I've played where every die roll is fun (just how sick are they going to get).  Certainly one of the greatest screw your buddies games produced.

There is a time investment needed and it can be a little fiddly, especially in teaching, but it is a wonderful game in the power struggles, the questions on who has influence on whom and the unpredictability of the shifting controls make it a terrific, if (potentially) long, game to play.

1 play, original version

This is like King Me! set in the Kremlin, and complicated by a bunch of extra actions/abilities. There are 26 characters (A-Z), with funny made-up-Russian names. The board shows a hierarchy of several positions with the Party Chief at the top (like the King), 3 level 1 party members, 5 level 2 party members and 5 potential candidates; and the rest of the People. People are randomly placed at the beginning of the game. Then, players secretly assign influence points to 10 people (55 total; 1, 2, ... 10). Then play proceeds in turns (up to 10 max) with each turn having several steps. During each step, someone in the party can exercise their power to do a variety of things (e.g., shuffle offices, promote/demote people, put them under investigation, attempt to purge them = send them to siberia, etc.). Most activities are stressful --> character gets older. During the turn, characters make a health roll, with the possibility of getting sick (age faster in the future) or even dying! In order to exercise the power, however, some player must reveal some/all of their influence in that character -- only the player who has revealed the most of their influence actually gets to exercise that character's power. Players can reveal their influence at ANY time. At the end of each turn, the Party Chief attempts to "wave to the crowd" -- roll the d20 (harder to succeed if you're a bit sick, even harder if you're more ill). The player who controls the Party Chief records the wave -- first player to wave 3 times with their character(s) wins!

The game is lighthearted fun - you get to roll the d20 and celebrate/groan when you see what comes up. But there's an awful lot of die rolling, and because you can reveal your influence at any time there's a lot of negotiation with people trying to make each other do what they want without revealing too much (until later). In that way, it's like I'm the Boss. And that's probably the biggest reason I'm not such a huge fan of this game: way too much negotiation going on! At 132min, it also dragged on a bit too long; I'd rather play King Me! (although that's not so great either).

Excellent game. Lots of fun, lots of difficult choices to make. One of the most original games I've ever played. Anxious to try it again with 5 players. 

Played it again and again. The fun is present all the time. The different possible influence combinations make it a new game everytime we play it. It is an incredibly fun game.

One of the simples and best games I've played with hidden capacities. There are great gaming moments, when you realise one of your bets is perhaps controlled by another faction.
The aging engine is really clever. Politburo members can have really strong options avaliable, but they have to pay a price for them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Hilarious game of influencing politburo members as they rise through the ranks -- the KGB chief can orchestrate purges, the defense minister can cast suspicion and cause trials, etc. Every action tends to prematurely age a character, and at the start of every round, there's a chance they might die.

It has a really interesting hidden influence mechanism, but most of the charm is in the hilarious flavour, from the gruesome actions players carry out to the brilliant art and characters like "Natasha Nogoodnik" and "Boris Badenuff".

Far too much chaos to be satisfying as a strategy game, but as an "experience game" it makes for great fun and great tabletalk.

Holds up surprisingly well to repeat plays. Playing its imitators -- Chicken Caesar, the low-luck eurogame version; Nothing Personal, ameritrash "take that" -- makes me appreciate the original even more.

[AH English 1988 edition] {Russia, politics; negotiation, secret-goal, dice-rolling, voting, paper-and-pencil; optimal 6p} It is a thematic and interesting political negotiation game. Looking up the tables is a little bit clumsy. Advanced rule is more fun.

I have played Kremlin (both in the original Swiss version, which I sold later on, and in the AH version) a lot of times. It always quite fun and it didn't matter too much that you actually do not have much control over what is going on.
Friends of mine are "celebrating" a game of Kremlin once each year on New Year's eve - complete with a big Soviet flag, bear caps and hats, army coats, Soviet medal replicas and of course the Soviet national anthem on CD, which gets played after each October parade.
You wouldn't believe how much fun this is even for the onlookers not actually participating in the game.

An excellent beer and pretzels game if I ever saw one.  Parody on the Soviet system of government.  Players play factions, each with secretly noted influence on certain in game personalities (represented by cards), that move up or down within the various offices of Soviet Russia.  Don't like a certain guy?  Purge 'em off!  He looked at you funny?  Kill 'em deadsky!  Great fun that usually leads to lots of laughter.

RATING: 9
An incredibly enjoyable spoof on Cold War Russian politics.  The influence mechanism (which is clearly the forerunner to the influence points in Twilight Struggle) is brilliant, surprising, and quite possibly one of my favorite aspects of any game, as it leads to tremendous interaction and tension, as well as humor.  Game can be a bit clunky (which fits for an 80's AH game I would imagine), and a bit unrefined.  But it really does not matter, as Kremlin is a tremendously fun game to play.

2nd Play:  Find a way to play this game.  The theme is head-and-shoulders above the rest.  In fact, I would say that the game is driven by theme, more so than any other game I have ever played.  Outstanding example of a boardgame as a superbly entertaining and engrossing experience.

1 play. This game is a 9 for uniqueness/theme, but I have to -1.5 for: A single unlucky dice roll can wreck your whole game plan and take you out of the running, super fiddly with the age tiles, and overstays its welcome in length a bit. But man what a cool concept and unique mechanics.

RATING: 7
The theme/flavor of this game is superb, even if I can't do a russian accent worth shit. I like it a lot, but it has its flaws. It's very easy to get knocked out of contention for the game based on what influence you bid and where, and if someone else bids higher. But since you bid before the game starts and in secrect it's extremely tough to make a truly smart choice. Still love it, though, maybe I just need to play it more.

The cynical theme of this game is downright brilliant.  It is absolutely a classic.  And like many of the classic, playing OFTEN wouldn't be enjoyable, but playing just very occasionally is amazing.

RATING: 7
I personally really enjoy the game. It seems to be a game that people either love or hate. The biggest issue with learning the game is that until you have played through it once it is hard to figure out a strategy and your most important strategic decision comes before the first turn starts. Consequently you almost have to play the game once randomly and start developing a strategy the second time around. The game involves a lot of deception and backstabbing though and that makes it a lot of fun.

Are the mechanics the best? No. But it's still damn good and the humor, the level of parody, and just the sheer magnitude of fun playing the game more than makes up for it.

(1 play) A fairly interesting hidden influence game.  Most of us revealed too much influence early in the game, which would make another play completely different.  There are too many other games that are much better though, so I don't think this one will be seen very often.

RATING: 9
Excellent light-hearted game, best played late at night after several beers.  Similar in style to Junta but at least 86 times better.  Generates much jollity, and the enjoyment to be gained from purging and putting people under suspicious is huge.  Downsides: the large luck element in allocating initial points can be irritating, it takes too long with 6 players and a perfect grasp of the not entirely clear rules is highly advantageous.  But for all that this is a corker - I find the thought of anyone not liking it incredibly suspicious...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Ah, Kremlin.  Great game.  I call it a sneaky-style game.  Goes even better with cheesy Russian accents.  You never quite know exactly what's going on.

The only bad thing is that a player can have all of his politicians taken out and nobody else knows it.  You're stuck the rest of the game doing nothing.  I recall having to suffer this and decided to just sit there looking smug until someone else commented on it.  I think there was another round of purges shortly afterwards....

I've considered moving this down to a nine because of the reason above but the helper text for a ten really describes how I feel about the game.

This games never fails to amuse us. While the AH game art and design suggests a serious strategy game, it is really a beer & pretzels game in disguise. Should be played with a bottle of Wodka nearby. Nastrowje comrade!

RATING: 7.5
One of the hardest game play to master. It's hard to get the hang of it. Early in the game you assign 10 politicians that you want to invest your influences on. This define the whole game right before it started. So if you screw up from the start, things would likely go down the drains for you. But I like the interactions and the health rolls. Hilarious deaths are within the game.

Good game, but it its age shows. It is somewhat fiddly and slow with very basic components (at least the Fata Morgana version). A cleaned up remake could be a great game. - The Avalon Hill version has much nicer components and feels less fiddly. The new edition Jolly Roger version has nice components.

Interesting game - but I'm not too sure about the randomized death/sickness. I'd have to try it again. Seems difficult to catch a leader.

Has some great elements, but overall really shows its age. I feel that a re-design of this game that preserved the basic ideas but modernized the mechanics would really do well. For now I'll stick to playing In the Shadow of the Emperor (for the aging mechanic at least).

RATING: 8
One of the games I fondly remember from when I was younger. Blends a satirical and really funny political theme with a gameplay full of backstabbing and double-guessing. Akin to "Junta" in this respect, but more elegant and streamlined.

Extremely complicated (around 1 hour to learn the rules) but it ended up being pretty fun because it relies on interaction between players. It was fun being the KGB and purging positions (sending them to Siberia). Overall though it isn't a game I see myself owning because it takes about 4 hours to play and is too complex and long for my taste.

Try to control the party chief of Soviet politburo. Negotiation and backstabbing are needed.

I'm really looking forward to playing this one for the first time... hopefully this Christmas time.
8/1 - Fun time. Lot's going on the first time, but it was a blast. The way you move through a turn is very unique - nobody actually takes a turn. Actions occur through control of politicians in certain roles. Getting through the phases of a turn and whether or not you actually perform them doens't really matter - everyone feels involved.

Yes it has flaws, but that's not the point here. The wackyness of everything, the box, the politicians, the rules, make it so loveable.

RATING: 6
Honestly, even 6 is probably too high a rating for this game.  

Having played a lot of games of the same vintage as Kremlin, I have to say that I think it was probably a fine game when it came out.  Today, however, it is too fiddly, and too unforgiving for a game of its length.

It is possible to get completely hosed during your initial placement of influence points - something which is largely a blind selection of points.  While we had fun playing, the people who got hosed in this way had virtually no involvement in the game.  Not an acceptable possibility for a game of this length in today's environment.

Dang funny and never a dull moment...especially love it when someone wins by bringing some poor schmuck all the way back from Siberian exile. The Health phase always seemed to cause the most anguish and glee.

Given up ever getting it back from CB - Now own the Kickstarter version.

Avalon Hill version. Played a couple of times but the non-gamers struggled. So much atmosphere in this game, wished I'd played it more.

Old School Wargame with an innovative enough design to sit comfortably with modern worker-placement types.
Minor printing iidiosyncrasies flamboyantly band-aided with reprinted fixes:
Jim of Jolly Roger Games worked very hard to make sure folks were pleased with the final product.

Verdict: Success

Amazingly great if your TV is broken, your book collection is eaten by chimps, and radioactive fallout prevents you from going outside.

[i]Conspiracy[/i] (influence), [i]King Me[/i] (political leveling-up), and [i]In the Shadow of the Emperor[/i] (aging) can clearly trace their roots back to Kremlin, but all three are distinctly better games.

For those of us who lived through the Cold War, this is a fabulous satire.  But even without that, it is a very good game.  How do you best wield your political influence?  As a friend of mine said, "there aren't very many deep games that also lead you to speak in a bad Russian accent," but this is one.

The best way to win this game is to give opponents no clue about which politburo members you might control.

And the best way to do that, is...?

Write your initial bribes, seal them in an envelope.
Walk away from the game and play something else for a couple of hours. Once the game is over, your opponents can open your sealed envelope and see if you beat them.

At a games convention, whatever else you play for those 2-hours will be more fun than kremlin.

Fun game, a lot of screw your opponents in it, with some randomness as well, particularly when the purging is rolled. After not playing it for about 8 years I had forgotten how much fun it really is.

If you have not tried it yet, go for a win by purging so many politicians that the politburo cannot be filled!  Big fun!

The game&#039;s probably only an eight, but if you really get into the bad Russian accents and gallows humor, it&#039;s hard to have more fun. (And it plays much faster than Junta, about which the same could be said.)

Random, silly and plays awfully long.  The secret influence assignment on politicians to try to get your party to the top position is a nice concept, but the execution felt very cumbersome (especially how it is revealed, as well as how ties are broken) and seem lacking in any strategy.  The intrigue cards are a nice supplement, but many of them often end up unplayed and ultimately useless (since quite a few are counters for other cards).  I doubt Kremlin had aged well, seem more like a collectible than a game I would play very often.

RATING: 7
For history buffs. Essential filler for wargamers but very sensitive in player count - not too few (3) nor too many (6, 7) is good. Attracts hilarious history and geriatrics-inspired trash talk, especially during Health rolls. I'm very happy to have acquired a reprint copy by Jolly Rogers that unfortunately and undeservedly caught flack for some minor print errors. Since I followed some wonderful classes about inner-party struggles in USSR during my time in college, I am particularly fond of this one.

Made a remake of the game myself. Backstabbing and psychologic gameplay. Who influenced who? Great theme, love soviet theme. You can send your opponents to Siberia. You need to read your opponent well. Negative : It can stalemate when someone gets all the important seats of the politbureau. Random event cards are random !

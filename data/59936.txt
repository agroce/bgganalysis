My last 3 player game of this went on at least an hour too long for my taste.  Others at the table said the same.  It just became boring long before it was over.  Not a game for us I'm afraid.

Fun competitive economic game where you're selling four different types of weapons (each with two versions) to four warring races across a board, and reaping an even bigger profit if they can win seasonal battles. I don't know that I'd like the 2-player game with the 'Salesman Steve' dummy player, but 3-4 players and this rocks. Colorful, intuitive, card play adding a little randomness on the market, and well worth a look. Great.

First impressions: Good game that has an interesting engine-building element to it. One that largely balances tactical and strategic choices. And surprisingly, doesn't feel as confrontation as I thought it would. 

That being said, the components were disappointing. Don't get me wrong, minion games wasn't being cheap/stingy... but the components make the game tedious, crowded, and annoying to play.

Overall, solid game. Just more fiddly than it needs to be.

The theme is cute and the art is great, but they do little to hide the fact that this is basically a pure, medium-light economic game, in which the "battles" are really just a matter of resolving competing investments. The board is just a bunch of stock tracks, and your investments are secured by selling to the individual races. 

I'm not normally into economic games, but I did like this, partially because of the special cards you can get that shape your decisions, as well as the fact that old battles keep being renewed as you make better and better weapons over the game. It makes for an interesting experience, as you choose which battles to lose, which to win, and which to hold onto for the long haul.

RATING: 9
Loads of fun, great game engine. I would rate this a "10" except that the art isn't my style, and I suspect that the fantasy theme was chosen to avoid the backlash that would occur if this were a more obvious critique of U.S. foreign policy. 

Can't wait to play a fourth game of this. I highly recommend this game. 

I have played twice with four players and once with three players. It plays better with four players. Have not tried two, and would like to see how wacky it is with Salesman Steve. 

Most of the players I've played with don't think the art fits the theme, or simply dislike it.

Felt like it could use some development. Or spice, or something. Just felt flat overall, without ever feeling like there are interesting choices. There is one element to the game, buying and selling weapons. There's not enough periphery to add texture, and not enough depth in that one element to rest on. Running out of craft cards (both decks) felt weird.

Tried this at Dicetower Con.

The theme is boring, you're "trading" weapons to different fantasy races, but races and weapons have no difference whatsoever, they could be called "Nation 1,2,3,4" and "pistol 1,2,3,4" and nothing would change.

Your actions are extremely limited and always the same.
Forge weapon, sell weapon.
Get an additional level in one weapon.
Place weapon, get money.
Rince and repeat.

Even "winning" the battles has little impact on your endgame score (up to 15 points out of a 130 or so to win), so it becomes boring to the extreme.

The final joke are the "special" cards, which appear to be highly unbalanced, to the point that some of them are an "instant grab" (a couple give you money and then let you take one standard action, thus being strictly better than taking the action instead; another one gives you another card at anytime, thus being "free", plus another bonus, etc.).

Terrible, terrible game.

Opinion: a really good surprise for me. This is an economic game with a good them on it, everything you do makes sense during the game. You have to produce your weapons and sell them to the races at war... no matter if you deliver weapons to both races in the same battle, the thing is that you have to make money.
Lot of interaction, you have to run for the spots where to put your weapons, you have to look at the different levels of the weapons from your opponents. 
In less than 1,30 hours you have an economic game, easy to learn, fun and with many good things

A game with streamlined mechanics and an original theme. Being able to sell to both side of a conflict is fun and thematic. Has a "the rich get richer" problem. It's hard to count opponents weapon's strength from across the table.  Having weapons ladders/tracks on the board would have been better.

"Economic game with an clever theme of selling weapons to elves, orcs, etc. Has a majority/area control vibe that I don't enjoy at all. Runs long for my tastes."

What I like:
- Moves along faster than expected
- Pretty straightforward rules, but with some real depth
- Nice components and fun theme

What I don't like:
- I really dislike arms races in games, and this is literally one
- A "sell cheap weapons fast" strategy doesn't seem viable (although the designer claims it is)
- Majority scoring bonus at the end
- I suspect there is a minor advantage to going earlier in turn order

Our learning game (new to 3 of us, almost new to the 4th) only took 75 minutes, after 30 minutes of rules/setup. However, it would have gone longer if my strategy hadn't included rushing the end of the game.

RATING: 8
Battle Merchants is a money-making game in which you spend money to forge weapons, make money when you sell it to the game, and then get extra benefits if that weapon happens to win its battle.  Battles, which are always against another player's weapon, are determined by the relative strengths of the weapons, and you can spend money to upgrade the strength of your weapons as the game goes on.  There are a lot of interconnecting parts here, all of which makes for a smooth experience.  The game does rely on card drafting (both for upgrades and special power cards), so some random card draw luck does apply.  Overall though, a fun experience.

I greatly recommend this game to all euro game fans and theme game fans, because the production value of this one is top notch.

I got to learn the game from the designer.  It is a great game.  Entertaining and involved, but not too much to figure out in one game.  The trick that the winner is the one with the most money is clever since the game has battles in it and the tendency is to want to win the battles.  Well done.  I look forward to playing again.

1 play, 3er

The game has a fun theme: there are a bunch of fantasy races battling each other. Players are merchants, selling everyone weapons trying to make money off the wars! 

Each season, in order, players take an action (increase craft level, forge weapons, sell a weapon, take a Kingdom Card). 
- Craft: skill that makes your weapons better (extra bonus at level 6).
- Forge: spend money to get little weapon chits. There are several types of weapons (each with separate Craft skills).
- Sell: to board, which has random distribution of desired weapon types, arranged in a line of battles between the races. You get money (more for repeat sales to same race). 
- Kingdom Cards: either single-use or permanent aids. 

The season ends when 3 new battles are assigned weapons (both sides): resolve battles, with better weapons winning. Winning player keeps loser's weapon as a trophy. Then, players earn 2 gold per weapon still on the board.

After 3rd (or 4th?) season, the players who've defeated the most weapons get a bonus, some Kingdom Cards pay off, and most money wins. 

We played with some prototype expansion rules, too, though I'm not sure what I can say about them. Heck, I'm not sure I remember all that much anyway! But it didn't really seem to be my kind of game. Something about it was annoying me much of the time. Was it too dry (buy/sell)? Too chaotic (those cards seemed powerful)? Too frustrating (when someone else sells to your planned battle)? Or too annoying when you had to look at everyone's boards to try to figure out what their weapon strengths were? The game really should have a central board to track that stuff, instead of individual player boards! I don't know I guess I might try it one more time, if it happens to be available, but the first play wasn't all that much fun.

So this isn't a game where you're a dwarf getting ready to slay some orcs. Nope... you're a weapon maker who'll sell hammers to the dwarves and axes to the orcs. You couldn't care less which race prevails... you only care how much money you make, and that your reputation for making undefeated weapons is widely known.

The game has three main things going on. A training area where you improve your weapon making skills (sometimes at a cost, sometimes free). A bonus card area where you get special perks or scoring opportunities. And the battlefield, where both the current battles and all future battles are laid out. Why do the orcs want axes to fight the elves today, and maces tomorrow? Who knows... that's the plan that was laid down long ago and we'll follow it forevermore.

Most of the game is about the battlefield, trying to sell your weapons in places that will give you more money, and where your weapon will defeat the opponent's weapon. But which weapon will win depends first on whether it's an uber-cool vorpal weapon, and then on the skill of the weaponsmith.

Oddly, no one cares how skilled you were when you forged the weapon, all that matters is how good you are when the fight is fought. Apparently it's all about reputation in this game. What's important is if you can roll up to a fight wearing the right designer's name at your hip. It doesn't matter if he was an apprentice when the blade was made if he's what's hot right now. So if you're committed to a fight that you're losing, you can maybe level up your smithing skills to sneak out a win. The blade is no better than it was, but your reputation will intimidate the opponent into submission. I picture the two forces lining up to show off their shiny new weapons and one side slinking away in shame at being caught with last season's fashion.

Overall I like the game. There's strategy and decisions to be made here. What's missing from the game is a grand plan bringing all sorts of diverse elements together. It's about one thing... making and selling weapons. That's it. So while that was fun, it felt a little one-dimensional. I would have liked for a little bit more to be going on in the game.

Played well with 2. Interested to see how it plays with 3-4 players.

Update: Plays very well with 4. Lot more strategy. The two player tends to be "how can I most take advantage of what  Steve will do". Much harder to control the pace in a 4 player game too.

Still want to play with 3.

A bit more fiddly then I had hoped. Once we got going it was fine. We did however break the game in the first round before finding the revised rule of taking gold on your turn. The rule book is not great and left some important things out. The components and art are okay. All of my cards were warped right out of the package. The theme seems like a fun one but it really wasn't present. I wanted to like this one more then I actually did.

When you get to be cynical and a certain age, the quality of each day is measured by the degree to which life surprises you. Battle Merchants is a pleasant surprise.

Pros:

Being an arms dealer is more fun than it looks, particularly when you can supply both sides of a conflict.  Just like in real life!

No workers were placed in the production of this game.  Good ol' WP is a mechanic that I will never tolerate again. Like, ever.

Cons:

Many 'serious' gamers will be put off by the fantasy art and unknowingly dismiss the game as second-tier junk.  Those people would be wrong, but honestly I can't blame them.  I had to be coaxed into playing myself, under protest, by gamers who I respect.  Otherwise, I'd have kept my distance.  And I'm more open-minded than most.

Though shockingly well-developed for a Kickstarter game, the rules still need tightening.  My rating would be higher otherwise. There are two problems with the endgame 'defeated weapons' scoring, for example: (1) it isn't specified how to assign points to tied players (an obvious omission) and (2) only the top 2 players score, which can be blatantly unfair - particularly when the bonuses are described as 'small' in the rules, but they really aren't.

My own interpretation is that endgame bonuses are generous for tied players: All first-place players earn the full 15 points and all second-place players earn the full 7 points.  If this isn't true, the game is simply bad. 

Better yet, a rules fix: Since the 'place' system for distributing defeated weapon bonuses is unbalanced, eliminate it entirely. Instead, at game's end, players earn a fixed number of points per defeated weapons tile (e.g., 2 points per tile).  Reminder - Recruiting good playtesters and editors is important!

Omissions like these make me wonder whether the designer crunched the numbers for the game's mathematical economy (where money = VP) and priced everything appropriately.  There's no way I'm running the numbers myself to check, though.

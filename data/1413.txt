This is a tough one, as most of our group isn't interested.  Rules have to "click" in your head, as the Contact Level concept is a bit confusing at first.  Game play is fast, but without certain cards, you can go a whole game and do practically nothing while your opponent does everything.  When cards are more evenly split, makes for a fairly fun game.

RATING: 10
A fantastic game by Mr. Allen who also designed Up Front. 

Attack Sub has similar play though you can get rid of a "dead" hand fairly easy, thereby playing faster, with great tension that builds as your opponent pings you with sonar.

Interesting choices each turn that can change the game in an instant!
 
As with UF will play anytime anywhere!

Excellent light card game.  It's not a simulation, but it is loads of fun.  It is kind of like Up Front for submarines.  Although it is a far lighter game, it has the spirit.

Jugado en casa de Pavlo. Juego sencillo y muy divertido. Vale la pena tenerlo en tu estantería porque en 15 minutos te has jugado un escenario y te has sumergido en la inmensidad de tu mesa sin tener que desplegar muchas fichas. Merece una revisión gráfica y nuevos escenarios con barcos chinos, indios, australianos y similares. Muy divertido.

If I didn't like submarines so much, I'd probably rate this a 7. I haven't played Up Front, just lusted after it for years, but Attack Sub is scratching that itch for right now. Gameplay is fast, with some good decision making required to best utilize your limited resources. Recommended.

Initial Impression: Card game with a submarine theme. The game has some interesting aspects, such as the way it handles relative range and sonar visibility. However, the game play was a little too dry for my opponents, and so it was rare to find players to play with.

[7/8/2006] Attack Sub saves deliver on the promise a submarine warfare cardgame holds. Gameplay is thoroughly pedestrian, offering little control and scope for strategy. With such releases, it's no wonder the hobby's old flagship got hit and sunk.

Attack Sub is a testimony to boardgame design having made huge leaps since. Time someone does a submarine warfare cardgame which can live up to today's higher game design standards.

This game is flat out excellent and is one of the few "designed as solitaire" games I actually enjoy. You actually learn something about the capabilities of the ships in the game, without getting too bogged down in unnecessary detail and chrome. You can play multiple games in minutes instead of part of a game on an entire weekend. It does what computer games are supposed to do, but I generally don't like computer games, so this is way better. Good starter game for kids as well.

A nice short game from an era of very long ones (Up Front aside). We liked playing the old 'Hunt For the Red October' pc game & this was very similar. We actually set it up with an umpire so you didn't necessarily know how effective the other guy's searches were which made it even more tense.

Its weird playing a strategy game from 1991. 
This game would be a modern day card game, but back then they tried to make it a boardgame with player sheets, counters and all. 
The cards as random numbers has been done a number of times since, but I still like it - this method has the suspense of real combat (will it miss or not?), and keeps the rules pretty simple. The slightly confusing part is how much info they put on the cards - its done pretty well, but slow going the first time through.

A simpler variation on the Up Front engine. Players control "sides" composed of ships and subs. Card play is similar to Up Front - players either play cards on each of their units, or discard then refill their hands. The contact/closing rules are counter-intuitive, and I'm not enamored of the play board for each of the units. Might be the theme? Seemed to be much less tension than Up Front, probably because most of the game revolves around making contact and getting out of contact with the enemy, rather than simply shooting the heck out of them or maneuvering in terrain. There also seem to be a lot less options. I'm sure that the comparison with Up Front is coloring my view here, but it is what it is. Will update rating after further play, but not a priority.

Broke out my old copy of Attack Sub again, in hopes to get my wife to play a game with me.  (She likes card games more than boardgames, she perceives them as easier to learn methinks.)  In the process of getting myself familiar again with the rules.  Afterwards I will need to hide the rules from my wife and tell her this game plays like [thing=50][/thing] with more theme...

Having overdosed big time on a concurrent game of Silent War and Steel Wolves, this tense but quick bang exciting little card game is a nice change of pace.

The rules are relatively straight forward and a lot easier to teach compared to Up Front.  One of the last legacies from the great AH.

Fast paced little card based (no board) Cold War era shooter game with smooth mechanics once you wrap your head around the abstracted movement/distance/target-acquisition concepts. A simpler aquatic Up Front. There are some serious play balance issues (mostly to do with Russian sub values) which were attempted to be addressed in The Avalon Hill General Vol. 29 #6 article titled "Transient! Transient!: New Rules and New Scenarios for Attack Sub". Articles such as this in The General were deemed by Avalon Hill to be officially sanctioned sources of errata and additional rules. There was also an article detailing percentages for card usage in Vol. 27 #6 titled "Plunging the Depths: The Cards of Attack Sub".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Probably my favorite card based game.  A great way to sim submarine warfare; searching for and prosecuting contacts, and then firing when you have a target solution (or do you wait a couple of turns to try for a better shot?).  My brother and I have had many great games of this.  I bought a second copy on Ebay to have a spare set of cards.

Courtney Allen's follow up to the legendary [i]Up Front[/i], this is a neat little cardgame of Cold War submarine warfare. The cardplay creates admirably tense gameplay that is not a mere copy of [i]Up Front[/i] with the serial numbers filed off. A success in other words, and a game I want to see on the table much more often. ;)

RATING: 6
I had heard this game was based on the Up Front system before playing, which is the main thing that got me interested in it. Having played it now, I think that maybe a few elements from Up Front were borrowed, but they are very different games.

Attack Sub is a very light game. The Avalon Hill rulebooks have a way of making tic-tac-toe look complicated, but really there are only a few different cards in this game and their effects are not that varied. In Attack Sub, players have their own small fleet of subs or ships and face-off in fictional scenarios. It is a card game, with players playing a card on their turn for every ship and helicopter they have, or playing defensive cards on their opponent's turn. It is hard to score a hit, but hits are deadly, as I imagine they are in real situations. The game is fun, no doubt. The cards can really limit your options, which some would find frustrating, but taken as a card game with the features of card games taken into account, this isn't a bad one at all.

An interesting game of modern submarine warfare.  Certainly more abstract than many of the other games I've played on the SUBject :), and the card-driven mechanics actually limit some of the players' decisions, but it also adds some situations that wouldn't occur in other submarine warfare games.

This game system would make an interesting submarine solitaire game...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
simpler than up-front. However it seemed to not provide enough options. Because both players have only few ships or subs, when you loose some due to unfortunate draw (you are not able to respond to enemy fire) you are likely not going to recover and it will be quire one-sided. Although it does play quite quickly we though it should play even quicker considering amount of decisions and fun. 

So although up-front is more complex and can take longer we have enjoyed it more.

This is not a simulation of modern Naval Combat nor was it meant to be. It is not Up Front below the waves. Once a player gets past that you will find a very enjoyable card management game which also gives players some insight into modern naval ASW engagements. It's a great way to explain some simple elements of undersea warfare and will also give you a very tense gaming experience in a short period of time. I don't look at the graphics as "outdated" either, I like to think of them as old school AH and I rather enjoy them for that.

How can you NOT love this game?  It needs a couple of tweaks for realism's sake - yeah, I'm a stickler about such things - but is otherwise pretty darn good and has stood the test of time.  Try to read The General article (Vol.29, No.6) about it for some notes about the flaws that unfairly disadvantage the Soviets.  Been playing this at AvalonCon/World Boardgaming Championships for 20+ years under a few variations to the standard scenarios for greater play balance, and it is a winner.

Update 8/12/16 - I actually won the championship at WBC last year, so I doubly stand by my comments, though this year I got pretty badly smoked - didn't even make the quarters.

Played this for the first time at the WBC. It's surprisingly easy to get into. The high concept here is Up Front under the waves, as you play cards to advance your contact level with passive of active sonar, or play counter measures, or fire a tin fish (swooosh) or dump your hand in frustration. 

It certainly gives the feel of ASW, and plays in 20-30 minutes.

Submarine, Naval warfare card game that borrows some mechanics from Up Front. It's lighter but still fun.

RATING: 5
Submarine based game with some similarities to Up Front, but has some extremely dificult to master concepts.

Nice use of the Up Front system but with much less grit.  The subject of this game has something in common with air combat -- sudden death.  I like the tension.

I like Up Front so much I had to pick this up. A navy themed card game using a modified set of the Up Front rules. Unfortunitly, it just doesn't work for me.

Really one of the most fun wargames I've ever played. Some similarities to Up Front but much more easy to learn.

Not quite as good as Up Front, but has interesting and innovative solutions to the move/range abstraction.  Use of markers can be somewhat confusing.

An old-AH card game? Crazy!  Of course, being old-AH, you get many pages of rulebook to describe a relatively simple game.

Lots of randomness in cards drawn and RN draws. There are definite strategies for card play/discard choices and card play selection/sequencing. Good game.

Disappointing if you compare it to Up Front.

Update (2013):
Played this game again after about 25 years (LOL). If you don't compare it to Up Front, it is actually quite a decent and playable card game.
Obviously, back then, my expectations were too high.

My copy of this game is sealed.  I don't think I want to punch it.  I'll probably hold on to it for a few more years and let it appreciate some more.  Then I'll trade or sell it.

It was a great father and son game at the time, and ended up going to sea with my son when he became a submariner in real life.  I believe it got left behind on one boat when he transferred as I've never seen it on his game shelf since.  Need to pick up another one so we can play again now that he's a little closer to home.

This is one of my favorite card based wargames.  In my opinion, its an overlooked gem.  It uses a simplified version of the "Up Front" card system, which is hard to describe, but anyone who has played both games would know what I mean.

Easy to teach. Concise, reasonably thorough rules. Scenario play balance not usually an issue because you can simply swap sides. 

Highly recommend using the Transient! Transient! variant from the General. 

I had a review and three new scenarios published in the Canadian Wargamers Journal (#31, Spring 1992).

It's not Up Front, but a good light alternative. Needed more depth (pun not intended), perhaps some sort of campaign game. Was a bit too light otherwise

RATING: 5.5
Haven't played too many of the scenarios, but the game seems a bit flat. There isn't all that much to do, when compared to the masterpiece that is Up Front. I'll play it some more, but it's pretty darn light.

A rip-roaring hoot! Rating will probably notch up a bit after I try a scenario or two with helicopters and surface ships.

RATING: 9
The most ambitious empire-building game I've seen.

As many point out, the rules need some serious effort
to decipher. I've done this for the original (to my
own taste). Would like to put the same effort into
the EU 8/9 updated version.

All that said, the game has many many flaws beyond
just the rules. The historical basis for the original
game is not well executed in some places. It is very
unbalanced in the campaigns.

There are a lot of small 'war' scenarios, which play 
out in a fairly short time frame. These are the way
to ease into this game, which is so much more than
a wargame.

I&#039;d love to actually like and/or play this game, as the scope is awesome, but this a mammoth, cluttered, unwieldy design that doesn&#039;t get a fraction of the payoff it needs for the investment. A take-it-out-and-gawk-at-it-occasionally type of game, not one to actually play.

One of the best games on the grand history of Europe from 1492 to the French Revolution.    You really get a good feel for the major events and conflicts of the major countries.    The rules are rough, but give it a try if you ever get a chance.

I've been fortunate enough to finish the campaign game twice.

A monster of a game which feels immediately familiar, since I've played both versions of the computer game. The English translation of the rules is quite stilted in places, but still comprehensible. It's just that they're so long!

RATING: 9
Fantastic game, in fact my favourite. The scope of the game (colonisation of the new world, exotic resources, trade competition, raising armies, technology, minor country control...) make this an epic with every game being different from the last. Especially nice are the historical random events (30 Years War, League of Augsburg, Reformation...) which force players to act in a more realistic manner and ensure even friends must at some stage fight each other. The pieces, both army counters and historical generals, and maps are very impressive too. Biggest failing of the game are the English rules - which are badly written and conflicting. This has been partially resolved by players clarifying rules and events (look up "Ville Virrankoski" in Google), indeed we use our own written rules. But don't let the rules put you off, get 5 friends around and start playing the Grand Campaign - it really is worth it. Oh last thing, time. We are nearing the end of our second game and in total the GC takes around 100 hours.
PS. Nate, I think you'll find the boardgame came well before the computer game.

Grand and very complicated simulation of the world politics and economics in 1492 - 1800 from the European point of view. No rating yet, as I have played only solitaire games this far.

Cluster-Fuck Milkshake. Beastly. Fascinating subject matter, but it takes a lifetime to play. Great for those who have that kind of time. It's a shame, really, because I'm a big history fanatic. If someone came along & somehow shortened this game, then maybe... Low rating reflects the BGG rating system. I just can't EVER see devoting a lifetime to playing this monster. That being said, I have tried the computer game version, which streamlines & simplifies things a bit, but it's still lonnnnnnnnnnnnnggggg.....

RATING: 1
An area movement game covering 2 centuries of warfare and politics in Europe from the 1500s to the 1700s.

PROS:

1. Interesting mechanics on combat, movement, attrition, politics, economics etc.

2. Excellent graphics

CONS:

1. Very complicated for my tastes, especially in the campaign game.

2. Takes a very long time to play.

3. While combat is very interesting, many battles take place with only one side suffering casualties while none for the other side. According to my knowledge, most battles in this era , both sides at least suffered heavy casualties(with the loser the first to break).

4. A lot of bookeeping involved.

Conclusion: Now I know why they made this into a computer game. However I don't see anything wrong with the game.

Huge amount to keep track of. Nice sense of control as you tinker with armies and the economy. Not easy to Solo either due to the amount secret bidding against players in Competition and Diplomacy. Plus the vast amounts of admin for all players. Truely epic though. Blows EiA away in scope. Has some nice features to hold the powers to their (roughly) historic strengths and weaknesses. The game is a little too deterministic and extreamly unbalanced (England tends to win).

Ok. Now this game is great. I really like it. The subject matter, scope, counters are all awesome, warranting a 10. However, the rules, which were translated...poorly, from French, are the bane of the game and lowered the score for me. We just went through them and clarified stuff for ourselves and created a few house rules and then argued our way through the game. Overall, it's great.

Hard to rate based on a play of the 1st battle scenario only, but here goes. The basic battle mechanisms work smoothly, and while I imagine that playing the whole thing would be time-consuming it would appeal I think if you are interested in the period. Where else can you get a scenario on the Campaign of Zenta? :D

RATING: 1
Badly written, obtuse, incomplete, mundane, boring and clumsy rules. Unergonomic counters and map. Lots of unimportant bookkeeping. Your group must be prepared to spend the first campaign just deciding how to play: what the ambiguous parts of the rules actually mean and what to do about the situations not described in the rules. 

The events - which are what could have made this interesting despite its flaws - are all bland and uninspired.

But what an excellent [i]idea![/i] Too bad about the execution.

Proof that there are some situations where video games are perfectly appropriate.

The negotiation in EU is absolutely brilliant, and its rules are smooth once you get it sorted out, but the accounting is downright unmanageable, almost absurd. There's an exception for everything, and more often than not, you find yourself wishing that you were better at rolling d10s. 

Really, this was conceptualized and produced in some alternate universe where one hour in our time is a second in theirs. The scale is so slow, it's science fictiony. This is what might pass for a board game in The Prisoner. It's a pastime so dense, convoluted and absurdly drawn-out that you forget that you originally came from another universe where people have jobs and spouses and stuff to do.

RATING: 7
A really really complex game.  It is more complex than Advanced Third Reich and Advanced Squad Leader.  It could be way more than a rating of 10 on Avalon&#039;s Hill complexity scale, if there is such.  I want to love this game but everytime you just have to drop the rulebook becuase of its sheer number of pages and a poor organisation translated from a French designer.  It appears that he wants to put everything into a scale that is too large to cover.  Coloful counters and maps, you really want to have a go some other time.  It cannot be rated higher than a 7 because it is too clumsy and complex for a game.  It could have been better developed, stramlined and more accessible.  The fact that it can be turned into a PC game nicely shows that it can really be a good game with a sound and proven game mechanics.  Get a taste of the PC version first and perhaps this would revive your interest back into the boardgame.  The game gets a 7 because of the designer&#039;s ambition, load of historical information, thousands of counters, dozen of scenarios and a grand scale simulation for a fascinating period in history.

RATING: 9
A tour de force.  Basic mechanisms are actually much simpler than they look, making the unprecedented amount of chrome in the campaigns bearable.

The campaign events are full of holes, but no other game has comparable scope or ambition.  And you get oodles and oodles of faster yet colourful scenarios if you have no time for the campaign.  Don't be scared off by people talking about the length of the campaign, this game has scenarios on wars that you will never find another game on,  and they are playable in an hour to an evening!  Don't let the unparalleled potential of the monster blind you for the fascinating vignettes.

Most unpleasant wart are the "fast play" battle rules (included in the expansion). Yes, they are faster... but they also systematically alter the battle outcomes, favouring draws over victories.  Is that intentional or just extremely sloppy fixing?  Simpler errors have made games unplayable.

I like that game, but this one is meant to be played by a group and sadly I don't have anymore a group. As many people have pointed the game requires bookkeping and this IMHO is the worst aspect of it. BTW there are loads of scenarios beside the long campaings. It is a wonderful historical tool.

An incredible detailed treatment of this historical period.  Economic, military and diplomatic details bog the "game" down but can make for an exciting weekend of marathon playing.

RATING: 4
The textbook example of a "kitchen sink design". So many good ideas for a game design that are trapped in a rule book that I found impossible to penetrate. Then there is the accounting...lots and lots of accounting. Are we rulers of a country or are we bookkeepers? The only reason I rate this a four rather than a three are the scenarios which are not difficult to play and most of them are pretty good (mostly because they don't have all the bookkeeping.

I get what they were trying to do. It seems that the designers wanted to take the Empires in Arms game engine and beef it up to make it more historically accurate and in that regard, they did succeed. As I said earlier, there are good ideas here. However, the chrome overtakes the game engine and the clarity of design intention that was the hallmark of EoA is replaced with excessive chrome. A missed opportunity. I have to conclude that the two individuals that rated this game as "medium complexity" are accountants in real life.

I look at this monstrousity with awe and do wish I will one day play all of it, obviously all by myself. Unplayable opposed if one tends to hang around with relatively sane human beings.

And...I did play it, the whole grand campaign, over 8 months of real time. It was tense, much tighter than I expected and, even with its multitude of minor and major ambiguities, flaws, (under-)development glitches, vulnerability to unrealistic trickeries allowing to game the system as written, it was great, in the most literal sense of the term! Nothing I know of comes anywhere near capturing the same grand scope with comparable detail. More modern, "cleverer" games never will.

One can't help but be impressed by the scope of this game.  A few years ago I was living alone in a two-bedroom apartment, and so actually had the space available to lay this bad boy out and contemplate playing it.  I've read through the rules a couple of times (!!), and halfway through it still feels playable.  By the end, though, I can't fathom it actually working.  I've known people to play it, so it must be possible.  At one point I downloaded many pages of errata, so maybe they help.

How to rate this game?

I played it only once, for two years. We used to play a turn every 15 days. From the first six players, only 3 survived till the end, friendships got broken. But, one reason to believe this game still is awesome, is that for those 2 years I trully believed I was in comand of the destiny of a whole nation.

That deserves a ten or a zero? I can´t say.

I truly admire anyone who has ever really played this. When it takes an entire page of rules to explain a siege combat -- something that I know is going to happen more than once in 300 years of 'Enlightenment' era history -- the term "monster" is definitely appropriate. There are 109 pages of rules (including the rules part of the "Annexes"). My favorite part of the game however is trying to decipher its rules from what looks like a machine translation from the original French: "You will note that the basic rules, once acquired, are sufficiently repetitive to create mechanisms of self-assimilation that avoid reading through the rules too regularly," etc. I've owned this game since 1993 and that phrase, "mechanisms of self-assimilation," comes up at least once a month in our game-designing strategy sessions!

I briefly joined a gaming group that were just starting up a game of Europa Universails. Every turn took several hours and considering the amount of turns in this game it would probably take months to complete. I wouldn't mind trying again though, if I could ever find the right people and a gaming schedule. Without a doubt the LONGEST civ game I've ever encountered. Would get a higher grade if the time factor wasn't so extreme.

Played this game twice, takes about a month or so. Remember this: the game is created to prove that France came out of this period in history better than everyone else. Therefore, you need to fix the points system if you actually want a game where France won't win 70% of the time.

At one time my holy grail, but I guess I will never find players for a face2face session. Still an interesting experience as PBEM and the PC Versions are spiritually and mechanical the bigger, better, faster heirs.

I think this game is specifically meant to emulate Paradox's video game series Europa Universalis. If it does a good job, I want in!

What a beautiful concept and game! Too bad the rules aren't better written.

RATING: 9.5
Mind-bogglingly huge game covering ALL of European history (and a fair amount of world history) from 1492-1792. Educational, frustrating, obsession-inducing ... all words I would use to describe this game. The computer version is good, but still doesn't capture the full, overwhelming effect of the board game. You will face the problems of monarchs of the era, and discover that there are no easy solutions. Rebellion of the wretched masses against your benevolent rule is always just around the corner; all it takes is a botched war or economic turmoil for your land to explode in kingdom-wrecking chaos and civil war. Fun, fun, fun! Only downsides; it takes a LONG time to play, and the French to English translations are sometimes dodgy.

Well, IF I ever play more than 3 turns of it, I'll give it an 8, until that time...

If I had to pick one game to bring with me to a deserted island, this would be it!

The longest and most complicated game I've ever played. I doubt that I will play it ever again.

This game is not a game, is pure historic simulation. A full Consim game. A monster game too.
But it is uncomplete in the rules, events and objetives. 
Would be excellent a third edition of this game. Would be THE consim of the modern era (1500-1800).

Even when I was younger and had the time to invest in this sort of monster, I don't think I would.  Sold it.

This is the only game, for which I gladly sacrifice 10 whole days a year. Every game becomes an epic tale which lives on for years in the friends circle.
Sadly the only downside is, the endless crossings of agenda.

Can't rate 'cause I haven't played.  Not been able to scare up enough people.  Attractive components and fascinating period.

Complicated? Well, the rules are extremely long. The basic system is actually not very complicated, just extremely detailed. Unfortunately, the rules are totally incomplete. The combat rules are something like 5 pages or less and have immense holes in them. There is a lot of history embedded in this one and as an excursion into the odd bits of history it is interesting. It does play out in the usual domination of the world scenario, even if there are a huge number of special events forcing players to do things that are less than optimal. It is somewhat overexaggerating to proclaim Europa Universalis as the holy grail of complicated (war)gaming. And yes, I have played it (as well as World In Flames, Fire in the East and some other heavyweights).

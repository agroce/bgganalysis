"Snakes!" is what my boy says.  "Big snakes Mommy!"  We've had some fun with this game.  6 as a game straight up 9 as a toy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
05+ or 08+, 2-4 players, best with 3, 15 minutes. More fun with magnets. These are strong magnets though so it's important to keep them away from toddlers who may try to eat them! I'm hopeless at this game (so far) and V is so wriggly and impetuous that he scatters eggs all over the place while playing. We have a perfectly flat board but those snake eggs still roll away. Nevertheless this is a happy distraction and takes no time at all to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a really cool dexterity game! There can be some really tense moments whenever the eggs are spaced out just enough to not clash with each other, and then you are forced to put an egg down. I played this with two and we laughed a lot while playing and had a fun time with RattleSnake. 

The only thing I don't like about the game is the die that's included with it. It is just a d6 with stickers on each side. I wish it was an etched die.

Clever or gimmicky.  I'm not sure about the staying power of this.  With four older players there wasn't much tension.  Best with three.

RATING: 4
You have magnetic eggs that clash together.  The magnets are so sensitive that you have to keep your "hand" well away from the board to avoid moving them around.  Also, the crease in the center of the board tilts the playing field, so the eggs roll around a lot.  My son loves it, but mostly to fool around with the magnets (which are admittedly very neat).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I found the magnets awesome and enjoyed clacking them together outside the context of the game.  Seems like a good kid's game for kids, but with a 3P adults game P1 won in turn order.  Just to see if we could, P2 and P3 also won in turn order despite the handicap of requiring everything on the board.  Still seems worth $10 if you like the magnets or have kids, and especially so if both are true.

RATING: 6
Nice quick filler or entry game, takes virtually no knowledge to play; there's a bit of skill, but the technique can be quickly absorbed from the other players. As a dexterity game, it doesn't hold much long term interest to me, but the game has a nice amount of novelty to it. Somewhat harder on tables that aren't level, or if you don't have a lot of room to maneuver your magnets around without getting near another player.

Despair is like a cable that is buried just under the surface of the ground. You pull it up and pull it up, but that cable just keeps right on going, clear across a field, until you come to a bunch of guys who are burying the cable. Then just walk up to them and go, "Hey, have you seen Fred?" And they'll say, "Fred who?" And you say, "Fred of snakes?"

Then cover your ears, because big laughs are coming.

When it's 3 am and you want to play just one more game before you pass out, Rattlesnake is always an obvious choice. 
Can be played by anyone of any age, as long as they have fingers.
For best results, fudge with your opponent by discreetly manipulating the board from under the table with your magnets.
I love this game.

Hard to rate this.  It's quite simple and that's fine.  It's really a kids game and that's fine.  But it's obviously a change of pace game and one that I don't jump to play.  But given what it is, it's fun for five or ten minutes.  Makes it hard to rate.

For what it is, it's cute and the kids really enjoyed their first play yesterday. I doubt it'll have a lot of staying power, but it's still a fun little game that we'll probably pull out from time to time and play a few quick games. For $4 it was totally worth it.

Game of laying magnets next to each other, while trying not to have them snap together.  It's actually surprisingly difficult.

This is a niche game, but a very fun one for that niche. It is quick to play (~5 minutes) and even quicker to explain (~30 seconds) and thus you can convince people to play who might be leery of a longer, more complicated game, or of any board game at all for that matter. The magnets are fun to play with too, so everyone has a good time.

Players take turns rolling a die, which indicates what colour snake they have to place the rattlesnake egg on.  The eggs are powerful magnets, and the snakes are illustrations on the small game board.  The object is to get rid of all your eggs via careful placement, but soon enough the eggs will start crashing together via magnetic attraction.  Goofy game that is part Dancing Eggs, part Polarity, and fortunately very quick to play.  Probably best with 3 players, as it's too easy to get rid of 3 eggs in a four player game.  Different, and great for kids.

Fun and challenging.  There's luck with the die rolls, of course, but still a lot of fun.  My 8-year old has learned the best placement strategies and can win now.  Quick and fun.  Worth it if you find a good deal on it.  I found it new for 50% off at a bookstore chain right after Christmas. After seeing tons of play, my daughter kept putting the magnets all over the house and her room.  I had to throw it away as 5 magnets were missing.

RATING: 5
Played twice.  I love that this game uses magnets, and the "rattlesnake" style magnets especially.  There's not much of a game here, though.  The board is far too small, which means that the game is over before too many interesting magnetic interactions get set up.  Still, it's a children's game, and kids will have fun.  This seems to be more of an activity than a game.

Great game made better with at least 2 boards.  With one you constantly place all the magnets on the board.  I think you'll quickly burn out if you play it too much, but unlike a lot of games where that happens, I think it will become fresh again with a little time.

Jogo super simples. Um pequeno tabuleiro com cobrinha coloridas desenhadas. Doze pedras magnéticas. Aquelas vendidas no centro da cidade, em que você joga para cima e elas fazem um barulho de inseto. E um dado com cobras coloridas desenhadas nas faces. Cada jogador rola o dado e deve colocar essas pedras em cima da cobra da mesma cor que saiu no dado. A graça é conseguir colocar a pedra sem atrair as pedra já colocadas no tabuleiro e ver os adversários tentando fazer o mesmo mas não conseguindo. No fim quem ficar sem pedras vence. Divertidinho enquanto se escolhe um jogo de verdade.

Kids game.  Each player have a certain number of snake eggs (its actually very powerful magnet).  On your turn, you roll a dice and you have to place one of your egg on the snake of that color without attracking the other eggs already on the game board.

It seemed like it might get stale, like there is a certain way that an exact number of magnets can fit on the board, but the die helps alleviate this somewhat. Even so, I can't really picture myself playing this one into the wee hours of the morning. Stil, I imagine this would be great with kids. Also, minor complaint, but the box is too big.

This game was pretty fun and my five year old son beat me legitimately once or twice, but the novelty of it wore of pretty quickly and even he isn't suggesting it anymore which tells me that I didn't make a great purchase.  Of course, I don't know what I was expecting since we are talking about a five year old whose favorite game is "Tigers & Euphrates"...

So, it's a children's game. As far as children's games go it was actually pretty entertaining, and it's very quick. Definitely not a game of skill, but especially with the right audience it's a fun way to spend like 10 minutes.

Tier auf Tier meets Polarity: Players take turns placing an egg-shaped magnet on the board. Magnets that click together as a result must be taken back into the player's hand. First player to get rid of all magnets wins.

Rattlesnake is a fast and easy childrens' game. The strategy part isn't particularly deep, and the game can drag on past its welcome, but for a childrens' game it is reasonably fun and occasionally exciting.

This is a fun use of magnets that works quite well.

RATING: 6
I was mildly disappointed by my first play.  I really like the idea of the game, but with 4 players it seems like the start player has a huge advantage.  At some point it is likely that someone else will mess up their placement, giving the start player a pretty easy passage to victory.  Hopefully further play will clear this up.  But it's a great idea for a game - quick, simple and interesting. '

UPDATE: Nope - whoever messes up first will clear the board for the next player, who, barring a disastrous die roll, should be able to win.

RATING: 7
Can't help but still think there is skill to playing this game.  Certainly there comes a point where you are going to not be able to place your magnetic snake successfully but there are also enough times where the steadier slow-motion placement should be successful where a less skilled player would fail.  Over the course of the game that should result in the more skilled player winning more often than not but to be honest I've really not paid much attention to whether that has turned out to be the case or not.

In either case it's the rare children's game that is equally fun to play by the official rules as it is to play with simply as a toy.  In both cases there is also some educational value so it has and likely will remain in our collection for some time.

Our 8 year old still enjoys it and has since he was 3 or 4 years old.

This magnet game is well thought out. It states two to four players and the 12 magnets are divisible by 2,3 or 4. The magnets when becoming attracted to each other make the movement of a rattle snake.

This game has a very fast playing time 5 minutes top.  In theend it came to what player makes the first "mistake". The player who's move is after that one will win the game or if he doesn't was really careless.
There is some tactical play in it as well I feel as the board can become unstable with only 8 magnets on it depending on placement.
There is also some luck involved because the dice determines on what colour snake you have to put your magnet.

RATING: 9.5
A fast kid's game (playable for grown-ups as well) with a bit of dice luck and a lot of manual skill. The extremely powerful magnetic "snake eggs" are fascinating - even a bit intimidating: when they abruptly shoot at each other and make rattling noises. Not easy to place them safely (even half a foot away from the board an egg in your hand makes the others already lying on the board turn and quiver). Lots of fun and laughs. Playable for five or six with two games (lay the two game boards edge to edge, 4 eggs each - with 7 or 8 players (3 eggs each) it seems to be an easy win for the first player, but we'll see - the rule to alternate the order of play back and forth might help here).

Magnetism, magnetism, magnetism.

Strong magnet = kids amazement.

Strong magnet + table + Strong magnet = kids thinking dad is a magician. :-)

I love this game :-)

Now for the game : Playing it is a real challenge since I think the magnets are on the strong side for such a small board.  Nonetheless, the kids have a blast with it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Game in a Nutshell: Try to place all your magnetized pieces on a board without causing any of them to "snap" together.

Played as: 2 player

Pros: It's always fun to see a bunch of magnets in close proximity playing off one another and reacting to any new force brought into the equation. With the rounded playing magnets in this game, it's even more evident as they'll twist and turn as the forces of physics realign. Has a very easy rule set that one kid could teach another in no time.

Cons: The included board is not a good playing surface. Assuming it doesn't warp, causing the rounded pieces to roll, it still lacks the friction needed to sustain the current placement of pieces through the flap of a butterfly's wings. Literally, a board could be still for a good chunk of time and then a magnet will snap, for what seems like no apparent reason, setting off a chain reaction. In the structure of a "game", who should be penalized for that? 

Other: Honestly, I bought this game at the thrift store for the magnets. I've considered throwing everything else away but I figure why not keep it around and see if kids are more forgiving of the unforgiving surface... now I just wait for the kids.

Best Use: As a science activity / toy.

Fun dexterity game where players roll a colored die which tells them which color of snake to place their egg on.  The trick is that the eggs are highly magnetic.  If two (or more) eggs come together than you need to take them into your hand.  First to get rid of all their eggs first wins.

Rattlesnake is pretty unique. There's a shared board covered with differently-colored snakes, and they are twisting and slithering all over the place. Each player is dealt an equal number of small magnets (cylindrical, tapered on both ends) before the game starts, then when it's your turn you roll a die and place a magnet on a snake that corresponds to the color you rolled. The magnets are quite powerful, and if you place your magnet too near the magnetic field of an already-placed magnet, they crash together and you have to take them both into your hand. First to get rid of all their magnets wins. It's silly, but simple enough for my 2.5 year old to get it and play. She requests it and even sets it up herself, and that has a lot of value. Fair warning here: you can't have your unplayed magnets too close to the board, or else they interfere with the gamestate. 

Additional fair warning: the 15 minute playing time listed here is an absurd overshoot. Most of our games take 5 minutes, tops.

Rated as it impacts play with children.   I really enjoyed this little magnet game.  It's much more difficult that it appears and the components are simple, yet cool.   For play with other adults, this is only a one-time filler...  players will think its cute and move on...  However...  if you have children, this game provides quite a bit more.  The game is reasonably priced for this use, and games are short enough to keep kids from frustrating.

I play this game more often with adults than kids! I regularly bring this game along with other party games, and it does quite well as a dexterity party game for adults. You can pretty much bring it anywhere -- there are almost no pieces that can be lost, and the magnets will stick together, anyway. You'll need a flat surface to keep the magnets from rolling, but I've even played it on an uneven grass surface at a picnic. This is definitely a game that kids, families, and adults can play!

Only have played this two player with my 4 year old.  So I haven't really been challenged by the game yet.  It would not be something I played all the time, but it seems like a nice short filler game to pull out while waiting for other games.

RattleSnake -- Played three- and four-player.  If a heavier filler is a "Super-filler", what's a lighter filler?  A "Hardly-filler"?  Very light and simple fun.

Scott Nicholson recommends trying teams of two when you have four players.

[BGCOLOR=#FFFF00][COLOR=#000000]Family.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Dexterity, Kids. Cool little game. My son enjoys the magnetic action. Adults and kids can play together, and a game only lasts a few minutes so it's very bite-sized entertainment.

My only "complaint" (using the term loosely here) is that it plays better with fewer players. There are 12 eggs/magnets, so with 2/3/4 players each player has 6/4/3 eggs to get rid of. This makes it easier to win with more players as there are more magnets out of play when you get down to your last 1 or 2 magnets.

Decent little dex game.  It is like Polarity with any of the strategy striped out, but then it also doesn't have the difficult learning curve either.   Very light lucky filler.  As with most of these kinds of games turn order is either your friend or your enemy, but not as much as the die.  Cute, but nothing mindboggling.  The kind of game I'd gladly trade for, but wouldn't buy.

RATING: N/A
Played a few times. This is a bit like Tier auf Tier, but not nearly as good. The main problem is that you get to the point where it is (or at least appears to be) impossible to place another egg (magnet) without causing the eggs to collide or roll off the board.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The board is brightly colored and the magnetic "eggs" are pretty cool-looking, but I can't say that I'd want to play this again and again; I found it more frustrating than entertaining.

UPDATE: I can sometimes find some fun in it, and since it does play quickly, I'm moving this up to a 6.

RATING: 8
What a cool filler!  Players put down big magnets and watch as they wiggle and waggle.  Note - For Extra Super Bonus Fun, once someone is good at the game, take one of your magnets and put it under the table and start messing with their mind every time they are about to play.  With 4 players, it's better to play as two teams of two.

RATING: 6
RattleSnake is a neat little magnet game. There are 12 magnets; each player gets 3. The board shows snakes in different colors. You roll a die and put the magnet down touching a snake of that color. If you knock (repel) any magnets off the board, or if you attract any to your piece, you take them to your hand. The first player to place all his/her magnets wins! There's a definite first-turn advantage, but this is a cute little game!

Looking at this game with adult eyes, it's hard to appreciate fully. It's basically just a gimmick concept, where you try to place magnetic 'eggs' on an increasingly crowded board without causing any of the magnets to come together. I can tell you from experience that kids love it, though.

People with very small children will need to make certain the kids can't get at the game unattended, because the eggs could pose a choking hazard, but despite that cautionary note I give it a high recommendation (many children's games with small pieces have that problem to some degree).

I've had good luck playing it with kids as young as 2 1/2, and even my very bright kindergartener, who plays and enjoys far more sophisticted games, has yet to outgrow it. There is no reading required, and it only takes 5-10 minutes. The kids learn to roll a die and match the color rolled to colors on the board, and they soon figure out that they need to place eggs as far apart as possible. There's also a toy factor; they love to play around with the eggs. As I mentioned above, I monitor that closely, but having a few moments before and after the game to just play with the pieces never fails to delight them.

Very fun, very thrilling, light dexterity game--playable by children and adults and fun for both groups.  A scoring mechanism for adults and older kids which fixes the turn-order issue, is you score the number of eggs left in your hand after someone goes "out."  First turn rotates until each person has the opportunity to play once, and the player with the lowest score wins.

RATING: 7
[several plays] Normally I am not into these type of game.  I saw this at a convention and it was super popular to go and play between events as a filler.  In the end I had to grab a copy myself to bring home and play with my kids.  I find this game more addicting than other games in the genre (i.e. Villa Paletti, Jenga).  It is a fun filler, or light party game people of any age can enjoy.  Four player games don't work as well as 2-3 IMO because there is just not enough eggs for everyone to start with and someone might not end up having to make a "tricky" play.  I am considering getting a second copy just to get more eggs.  Overall this game is a hit, the kids and extended family love it.

RATING: 5.5
[FFG 08 edition] {Kid; dice-rolling, dexterity; optimal 2p} RattleSnake is a lightweight fun game for family.  The fiction of the board and the magnetic strength of the eggs are quite well tune. It's neither too hard nor too easy.  Players need a stable hand and some spatial logic to place an egg safely. It's a good dexterity game for children.

It is exciting in watching and playing the game, esp. when all eggs are wiggling when you are placing an egg.  Children should be very happy about this game.

The illustration is attractive.  The dragons are quite cute. I love it.  I have to complain again the box is horribly thinker than necessary.  And, I think the game will be more exciting with more eggs.

Interesting dexterity game, but the board is too small and bends too easily for it to be fun. Plexiglass is a requirement, and even then the game is too luck based and childish to be fun. Maybe if the board was larger and perfectly flat it would be more fun.

Only reason I give it the rating it has is because the magnets are very strong, weirdly shaped, and fun to play with outside of the game.

RattleSnake is a real surprise:  a dexterity game hung solely around unique components that are entertaining in and of themselves.  You could carry a few in your hands and clack them together all evening.  The game is fast and very tense; the eggs seem to have minds of their own.  But don't get them anywhere near your bank cards.

RATING: 7
I initially dismissed this as a gimmick. While the eggs (magnets) certainly are fun to play with on their own, there is more to this than I first thought. By carefully manipulating the egg (magnet) you are placing, you can cause the eggs on the board to move enough to create a safe spot for your placement. I am sure this will see many more plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I enjoy RattleSnake, even though I would relegate it to my kids/teenager pile.  With adults, it's tremendously amusing, but I don't know that I would pick it up on amusement factor alone.  With kids, it's a great game that they can be on equal footing with adults and learn something about magnetic fields while they are at it.  High quality components; fun, colorful artwork; and fast, simple game play make RattleSnake a great kid "filler" game that will produce lots of laughs and groans and keep folks entertained for fifteen minutes.

Simple and crudely effective.  Really, it's structured playing with strong magnets.  But the magnets are strong enough that they're fun nonetheless.  Sure, there's not much here, but considering the game takes all of five minutes to play, it's tough to hold it to a very high standard.  Did I mention the magnets?  They're pretty cool.

Это странно, но я не понял правила. Вроде можно в свой ход примагниттить какой-нить крайний магнит, чтоб убрать его и положить на его место свой. Тупиковая ситуация, но что делать если больше никуда ложить не рискуешь, т.к. будет еще хуже.

Cute!  The real appeal is the magnets in the game, but there's slightly more here than meets the eye.  Like Dancing Eggs makes a good adult game, so does Rattlesnake, since adults can make some of those careful, careful placements to get the egg to rest evenly on the board without causing the others to clack together.

RATING: 6
Great kids game.  Rating drops to a 5 when someone eats the magnets and a neighbor has to call 911.

An aside:

It's natural to assume that the poles of Rattlesnake magnets are located at their tips.  The poles are actually located on the magnets' bulging sides, which you can discover by putting two of the magnets side-by-side and rotating them until they strongly repel each other.  (By "rotating", I mean turning them on their axes like soup cans rolling down a hill - not spinning them like propellers.)

Once the magnets are strongly repelling, you can mark the repelling side of each magnet with a piece of tape marked "N".  Similarly, on each magnet, you can mark the side opposite the "N" side with a piece of tape marked "S" to show the opposite pole.  (You can verify your handiwork by seeing if both "S" poles also repel each other.)

Once the poles on both test magnets have been identified, you can use those magnets to test and identify all of the poles on the remaining unmarked magnets.

Admittedly, you don't actually know whether the initial "N" poles are both north poles or both south poles - but it doesn't really matter.  The important point is that you're finding which poles are the same and which poles are opposite.  If you're a stickler for correctness, you can obtain a bar magnet with labeled N/S poles to clear up the issue.

For Rattlesnake to be a maximally educative experience (e.g., in a classroom setting), the poles on the magnets really should be labeled - otherwise there's no way to tell whether two side-by-side magnets will initially attract or repel when placed on the game board.  But I suppose that's all part of the fun.

nice magnetic dexterity game.  Not alot to it, place your peice & don't mess up everything.  It's been fun with everyone I played, but not to exciting.  Once you get good at feeling the magnet pull, it comes down to how full the board gets & what the dice roll.  The incredibly cool thing is that all the different color snakes have different faces.  So it's great for color blind & color sight.

The "eggs" have very nice magnetic fields, but this dexterity game is pretty much decided by the first person to have to pick eggs up.  It's suspenseful, but challenges the players too little.  Because Polarity requires the players to lean magnets on others' magnetic fields, having played that, RattleSnake feels trivial.  On the other hand, it's very fun to just play with the magnets....

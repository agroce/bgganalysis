I bought this to play with Benny - I think he'll be able to place the pieces down, but not react to the monsters yet.  We'll see!  Should be fun, anyway!  8 as a rating reflects the fun I have with the game & player (Benny)

02-05, 2-4 players, 10 minutes. Gave this to T for Christmas 2011 and have one for H for Christmas 2012. A fun first game for a 2-4 year old but not for long-term interest. A great way to learn about taking turns, sequencing, matching etc. Perfect game for kids who love the book "Go Away Big Green Monster!".

Well, my daughter is two years and five months. We already play ‘Shopping List’ ‘Red Dog, Blue Dog’ and ‘Cranium Cariboo’ so I thought this would be a good addition. She was so excited to play but I think when I first pulled a monster out the bag I made too much of a big deal about it and I think that worried her. She was a bit apprehensive about putting her hand in the bag, so to make things a little less scary we got all the monsters out, gave them names, handled them etc. This hasn’t worked she rarely puts her hand in the bag anymore, maybe once a game if we’re lucky. I think this will take its place alongside the great three games I mentioned earlier, just when she gets over the fear of putting her hand in the bag. Maybe I should drop some sweets in there too ha.

Nope, sweets can't get her hand in the bag.

RATING: 6
Legit game for kids of a very narrow age/ability window. Suggest handicapping it by having adults play multiple boards. I like it in concept, but it's avocado-like in the, "no good, no good, no good, PLAY, no good" timeboxing. You want kids that can resolve shapes blindly, yet not be bored by doing it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I can imagine that young children might get a kick out of this.  For me, no.  I doubt I'll play it again, unless a three-year old asks me.  I suppose it could be used in an occupational therapy setting, trying to use your tactile sense to determine what you need to pull out.

UPDATE (January 2018)
My initial rating of 4 was based on my play with adults.  This is NOT a game for adults, not is it a game adults would get any enjoyment out of without a toddler present.  My two-year-old loves it, and asks to play all the time.  It's still not a great game, but boy, is it a great experience for little kids - shape recognition, turn taking, and empowerment over monsters are all in play here.

My 2 year old just loves this. True, the game is little more than a sort of bingo, but the art, the tactile element and the "co-op" nature of the game makes it perect for the youngest ones in the family.

Plus, my kid has learned valuable lessons towards his future board game geekiness, such as turn order and table talk.

UPDATE: My son still loves it. Too much, unfortunately. There's only a certain amount of continuous plays of this you can stand. Down to a 7.

UPDATE: For what it is, and its intended audience, it's a nice game. For all the rest, is as boring as Bingo. Down to a 6.

Simple game for YOUNG children.  Two plays so far with my 15 mth old son and he is getting the hang of drawing pieces out of the bag, taking turns, and possibly noticing where the pieces go on the board.  He is on his way to being a boardgamer.

A year and a half later: It didn't take very long for my son to fully get the hang of this game, maybe about 21 months or so.  Almost three now he still loves it and we all enjoy playing it together!

Another kid later:  Our first son is four now and still likes playing.  He will teach the game to anybody willing to sit down with him.  With our second son, we started this game at 11 mths which turned out to be a little young.  Now at about 20mths he plays much better although still a little learning needed about how to take turns.  This is a really good game that we can ALL play together!

Still later:  Our oldest is now 5 and he just doesn't request this one anymore.  When I asked him why, he said we could play it.  Maybe he just hasn't learned the skill of getting the game you want to the table...  Regardless, with #3 nearing gaming age, this one will still see many more years of love.

The initiation of Child #3 to games has begun.  We waited 'til about 17 months this time.  She has seen us play enough that she sat right down.  Still a little rough on taking turns the first time or two, but she is doing well now and starting to catch onto the shape-recognition.  This is still the #1 game I recommend to families with young kids/toddlers.

I got this for my two and a half year old and he really enjoys it.  He's old enough to take turns, recognize the different types of pieces, and put away the game when we're done.  When he draws a monster he very loudly shouts "Go away, monster!" but then he usually puts the monster in his bed and says very softly, "Goodnight, monster."  All in all, an excellent first game.

We just gave this to our just-turned 3 year old for Christmas and she really enjoyed it; however, that day she lost the bag for it and we have yet to find/sew a new one for her.  First plays were fun but I think this will lose steam before she is 5.  Good for now though, especially in a hard to fit niche market (i.e. 3 - 5 years old).

Great first game for kids.  It teaches turns and sharing and it gives them a game of their own that they know how to play.  Our 2 year old was able to pick this up right away, before she was able to play Candyland or Snail's Pace Race.  

UPDATE: She hasn't played much at all since she turned 3 and learned to play other games.

Gamewright.  Just picked up the updated version of it.  

I suppose I feel there isn't a need to own too many 3-to-6-year-old games.  Draw items from a bag to complete your room.  When you draw a monster yell "go away monster!".  Fun for littles, but they will phase out of it pretty quickly.  I would rate it better if the number of years of play were greater.

Destined to be a first game for the little ones of the family... when they are a little older. Played with my son and he loved it. He was able to be entertained right to the end, drawing all of the bits out of the bag. This is a great "game" - more like an activity - for kids 2-3 years old. Especially ones who like puzzles as much as my son does.

Increased my ranking 2010-10-04. Clear and definite appeal for younger kids, a great start in playing games. Nobody loses, basic gamer skills are easy to develop, and the kids get to feel empowered. I wholeaheartedly support playing this game with your kids before they even turn 2. My daughter caught how to play just by watching, and she was only right around 2 years old at the time.

I watched my husband begin to teach this game to our 22 month old daughter last night.   He started out by showing her the game pieces and the bedroom and having her match the pieces to the room.  Our girl is excellent at putting together puzzles so she really enjoyed that.  Then, they moved onto learning to take the pieces out of the game bag, one at a time.  After a few rounds of 'it's daddy's turn, now it's your turn', my husband decided to throw one of the monsters in the bag.  The daughter immediately realized this was a new piece and my husband did an excellent job of freaking out and throwing the monster out of the bedroom.  

Our kid caught on pretty quickly and did manage to throw the monster piece a few times, trying to say 'go away' just like dad.  10 minutes later though, she had pretty much forgotten what to do with the monster tile and was back to trying to find a spot for it in the bedroom.

We know she's much younger than the recommended age for this product but I can already tell this game is a hit.  It does exactly what it is supposed to do; teach kids how to follow rules in a game and take turns.  To me, the pieces and game boards did not look fantastic, but my kid absolutely loved them.  They were the right size for her hands.  I look forward to seeing her teach her sibling this game in a few more years :)

For an 24-30 month old it's a '8'; the first game both my kids played and enjoy pulling the items out of the bag. Quickly get the process of matching the pieces to the board and learn about taking turns. A well used game even if the 'game' element is very simple. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
For a just turned 2-year old, this is the #1 pick.  This is also a favorite game of my 4 yr old grandson.

I am always in a quandary how to rate a game.  Every 2-5 year old game I would probably rate a 3-4 because I play only when asked, but would never turn them down no matter how much I disliked the game.  Based on the fact my grandson always chooses this game, he would rate it a 10.

My grandson just turned 2 this month and what a hit this game is!  His favorite book is titled, "Go Away Green Monster!," by Ed Emberley, so this fits right in.  Also the game bag is nice & deep so that it is harder for him to peek to see what he is pulling out, which he wants to do.

This is the first game where we follow the rules exactly.  He also likes CooCoo, Dancing Eggs, Animal upon Animal, Go Fish!, Itsy Bitsy Spider, Snail's Pace Race, and Zimbos--but in all of these we adjust the rules or sometimes discard the rules.  

It is a lot of fun to watch a child develop concepts of taking turns, matching, advancing components, and of course, counting the pieces & putting away.

A really good introductory game for kids.

Not much to it, but this was the first boardgame that I played with my son - at 17-months old.  He gets that the monsters go back in the box and the other items go in his room (after only a couple of plays).  He is also pretty good at taking turns drawing pieces from the bag.

In my experience thus far, I'd rate this as the best "first board game" out there. Teaches a variety of important skills to young children including sharing, shape matching, waiting their turn and, of course, self confidence and courage. It is adorable enough to play with them that I really never will turn down a game of this with a little one. The fun factor also goes up if you're willing to get silly with it.

Great for kids 2.5 years old and up. Draw a tile from the bag. If it's something you don't have, put it on your board. If you already have it, give it to someone. If it's a monster, never fear! Just yell, "Go Away Monster!" and get rid of it (we just throw it back in the box). Great kids game.

Greatest children's game ever. My four year old and two year old both enjoy this game and love shouting Go Away Monster!

If your children like this game, try Go Diego Go 123 Game. 

Now that my kids are older, we no longer have this game, but for preschool age children, it is really a wonderful game.

RATING: 6.5
The parents opinion:
It's a fine game for the smallest gamers. Teaches turn order and shape recognition. 

The child's opinion:
First impressions (1y 9m old): Drawing the tiles is exciting. Placing furniture in the room is fun. Imitating monsters and saying "Go away!" is also fun. Taking turns is not fun. Down time in four player games makes me restless, but I still request to play this often.

This a great first game for children.  I picked it up for my 2 1/2 year old.  She caught on really fast, and loves throwing the monsters as far away as she can, when she finds one of them in the bag.  Rating is only applicable when playing with children - duh.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
This is a kind of a game, I suppose, if you play the competitive version. But whether or not this is a game is not really the point. It's cute to watch kids anticipate what they might draw out of the bag and yell "Go away monster!" I'd score this lower if it didn't provide these simple pleasures. I don't know about the 3+ age on it. I'd start kids on it sooner than that. I bought it for my daughter for her 3rd birthday and she tired of it after half an hour. Too repetitive. My low score is mainly influenced by her enthusiasm. She's gotten far more enjoyment and longevity out of Cheeky Monkey and I've Created a Monster...

UPDATE: Well, my daughter is now almost nine and she reports to me that she still plays this with a friend of hers. Baffles the mind, really, but I guess there's longevity for you....

Nice artwork and components but not a high level of re-play value. My two year old quickly figured out that you could feel the different shaped pieces in the bag and avoid the monsters (or intentionally pick the monsters!)  The box recommends ages 3 and up, but I don't think this game will offer much challenge to the over three age group.  Also, there are other games that are more fun for adults to play along (Hisss is a favorite of ours).

Really too simple for my 4 year old but he does enjoy feeling into the bag and almost hopes to pull out a monster.  He also likes to accidentally place a monster in his room and then go "whoops there is a monster in my room" and then picks it up and throws it into the box saying "go away monster!".  Have managed to play this with my 22 month old son as my first ever game with both kids!  He seems to have got the hang of the basics and enjoys playing it with other older kids.

My rating is based on how much I want to play this game with my 2-year-old daughter.  With adults, it would be pretty ridiculous, and I'd rate it a 2 or something.  But when my little girl picked right up on the game and was saying "Go away monster!" almost immediately, I knew that this would be a "go to" game for the two of us for a long time.  Very highly recommended for preschool children and their daddies who want to get their kids into playing games.

my 2 year old daughter got this as a Christmas present from her grandparents. it was basically our first board gaming experience together, and it was touching and special. we played twice in a row and had a blast! the component quality, from the box to the pieces are amazing quality. chunky, durable, and the art is perfect for the game. sure, mechanically it's nothing groundbreaking, but i'm giving it a 10 based on the experience it gave me with my daughter. we'll play this a lot!

As far as games that you can play with very young children go, this one is pretty darn good. Unlike Candyland, play time is pretty consistent, and quick. Unlike Candyland, the game is not totally random, so your kids are actually rewarded for playing skillfully. Unlike Candyland, the artwork is cute and appealing, not garish and ugly.

As far as options for games you can play with 3 year-olds, this is easily one of the best.

RATING: 9
Okay, I know, 9 may seem like a high rating for a game for 3 year olds (rated by a 34 year old).  Each time my son carries it to me, smiling, there is NO CHANCE I would say 'no' to playing.  

So what keeps it from being a 10?  I suspect that at some point, he will no longer be bringing me this game.  Thanks to BGG and my problems maintaining a budget, I have over 300 games for him to choose from as he gets older.

My son is approaching 2 years old.  Our games go like this:
-he brings out the box
-I open it
-he dumps out the contents
-he finds the blue monster we call "Mr. Boggersnot"
-he stick him on my nose and we both go "Doh doh doh!" in unison
-he throws the monster, and the four beds into the box
-he requests that I hold "Mr. Stink" up on the other side of the cellophane window, and bounce him around
-he clicks some of the bedroom pieces onto their places, and we both clap for him
-I put some piece in the bag, which he pulls out and throws into the playing area
-we find most of the pieces and put it away

UPDATE:  New variant!
-piece by piece, Robert puts the components into my hands
-he then jumps up and down asking to be picked up
-we run around the house yelling "Yea!" while I hold the pieces up above our heads
-his mother tells us to "calm it down"
-we put the pieces back in the box
-repeat

UPDATE:
-the middle one never got into it - he jumped to sports and Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation.
-the little one now is asking for it frequently

KIDS GAME.

Brian was able to play this game somewhere between ages 2 - 2.5.  He likes yelling "go 'way" as he throws the monster pieces back in the box.

Zelda started playing this around 18 months.  She could match the pieces to the right place (most of the time) and throw the monsters into the box (always).  She'd also always give the blue monster with the black nose to Brian, because it's his favorite.

I've probably played 30+ times with the two older kids.

After a couple of tries, Lark asked to play this game. All three of us sat down to play, and Lark took turns, politely gave us pieces she didn't need (usually), and had a great time throwing the monsters and shouting "Go away, monster!"

I'd heard this game was playable with a two-year-old, and that's true. It teaches taking turns, cooperation, and following the rules -- and it's cute to look at and fun to play, too.

We tried to play this with Lark twice, and she wasn't that into it -- but then she asked to play it unprompted, and has since done so again. Playing a board game with my daughter makes this geek dad proud!

My only complaint is the box, which is kind of an annoying format; I ripped it trying to open it the first time.

How does one rate this? The game is nothing in itself but it's a great teaching tool showing children the social etiquette of game playing. In honesty, it's fun just watching how much fun *they* have while playing it: they love the tension of wondering what's coming out of the bag next. That's if you have kids of course. If you don't, the experience will probably be so "cutesy" that you'll be sick in your mouth.

[RATING AS OF TWO YEARS + ONE MONTH:  8]

I just started playing this game, and so far I love it.  I love drawing pieces from the bag, and I love that I can pick out the beds without looking.  I've also been able to try and find the teddy bear in the bags.  I love matching the pieces to the board, and I love saying "go away monster!" when someone draws a monster.  I'm learning to take turns, and I'm learning to match the pieces to the silhouettes, and I'm also learning how to tell the pieces apart by touch.  So far, we've only played the cooperative version, but I enjoy playing this multiple times in a row.

[UPDATE:  A COUPLE WEEKS LATER:  RATING 7]

I still like playing this game, but I don't ask to play it as often as the other games that I own.

[UPDATE:  ABOUT A MONTH LATER]

I still enjoy playing this game, and still frequently ask for it.

We picked up a copy of Go Away Monster! for AUD$20 at Cancon and it has gotten a fair bit of play over the last week.

It's good in that it isn't language dependant and is a lot of fun for the littlies. The draw from the bag mechanism works well for this age and my little guy loves to shout "Go Away Monster" at the top of his lungs and then throw the piece in the box.

The only real weakness is the lack of variety of objects in the box (I just feel five or six options would have been a bit better) and the fact that the bed piece is really easy to pick out as it's much bigger than the other pieces. Other than that, no complaints and one worth looking at if you have littlies you'd like to introduce games to.

Got this for my Son who is 2 and he can't get enough of it.  Got it mostly to teach waiting your turn, and fair play.  Worked brilliantly.  I won't even track the plays.  Already at least 40.

I initially though this was an awful game with boring game play" even for a toddler.  But my 3 year-old loves it, and my 5 year-old seems to like it.  It is handy for kids who do have a fear of monsters, as they get to "take charge" of their fears by yelling the title of the game.

Basically, you pull pieces out of a bag to create a room for bedtime. If you pull a monster, you yell Go Away Monster and play continues. That's it.

Excellent game for very small kids- my daughter can play at two years, five months.  There are no decisions, but since the cards have different shapes you can influence the outcome by feeling the pieces in the bag.

This held the attention of my four-year-old when playing with her little sister, but I think she'd prefer something more advanced if given a choice.  I wouldn't buy this for older than about age 3, but for a first game, this is the best choice that I've seen.

RATING: 10
(50+ plays)  Yes, the game has achieved 10/10 for us.  I am having a blast playing this with my 1 and 3 year old... now 2 and 4 year old... now 3 and 5 year old... The 3 year old totally gets the game, and tells the monsters "GO AWAY MONSTER!" with all seriousness.  From when they mostly grasped grabbing one piece of cardboard out of the bag, and put it on her board or share (when we tell her), or throw it in the box (when we yell "GO AWAY MONSTER!").  Big smiles from both kids and both parents!  But then... big fights... big tantrums... It's a dramatic event at our house.  And that's why it gets a 10.  Super memorable - huge gaming event - kids ask for it all the time.  It's a big deal around here.
They've played it so many times now, they don't ask for it much anymore.  We probably have another year in this one before they've totally outgrown it - but it will have lasted a solid 4 years in the family by then.  I'll miss it.

Great game for little kids.  Mine are 2 1/2 and they love love LOVE this.  They ask for it every day, and they scream when we put it away.  I've picked up a couple extra copies as gifts for friends with young children, and I haven't found a kid yet that doesn't love this game.  The downside is that it's pretty boring for adults.  UPDATE: The twins turn 3 in a couple weeks and they still like this game.  They are not quite as obsessed as they were a few months ago, but they still like it.  Sadly, it is still quite boring for adults.  UPDATE:  5 year olds still want to play it occasionally, though infrequently.  It's more competitive now, as they can feel the shapes and try to pull the piece they want.  It's less cooperative than it used to be, with each kid trying to be the first to complete his room.

[BGCOLOR=#FFFF00][COLOR=#000000]Family.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Children. Great game, my almost-3-year-old loved fishing for tiles out of the bag and throwing away the monsters. Be warned: don't overdo the "Oh no, a monster" as a parent player - I think this scared him a little; he pulled out a round tile thinking it was a picture and was startled when he flipped it over and saw the monster.

RATING: 2.5
This would be a solid 2, but for the fact that I have small children, and so *must* allow myself to occasionally be convinced to play this. So, the 2.5 indicates that.

CHILDREN'S RATING: 8, assuming the child is 2-3.5 in age. It's really a superb first game for the little tykes, and really a must in your collection if you have them! They have a lot of fun yelling "Go away monster!" and chucking the monster heads. You can alter the rules to be nicey-nicey too.

A very cute little game, that I bought for my 3 year old daughter on her birthday.  She loves watching us play "big people" games and always wants to join in, so this is a great item for her.  It is very simple and she caught onto the rules right away, even taking turns properly.  She loves getting monsters and shouting "Go Away Monster!" almost as much as getting pieces for her bedroom.  The game only lasts about 5 minutes or so.  Of course, a 3 year old can play it over and over and it gets a little thin for adults after a couple of times.  She has learned, however, to play it by herself, which is nice.  Well worth 12 bucks for the budding gamers in your family!

Fascinating study of socialism combined with materialism.  The moral of the game is that everyone should get sweet stuff. The theme alone is worth a three rating.

I love how everyone starts with toys, but no one has a bed.

Great for kids to learn to share and take turns (I rate it a 10 for two and three year-olds).  Nothing here for adults.

RATING: 7
This is a fine game for very young children. 2 1/2 seems to be the age at which my grandchildren were able to play it properly. The idea is to pull pieces blindly from a bag, and the first to get the four necessary pieces for their room wins.

The bag also contains monsters, but of the silly variety that cause giggles rather than gasps. When drawn, the child says Go Away, Monster!.

The various pieces have different sizes and shapes, so this makes it easy for an adult to unobtrusively have 'bad luck' by drawing lots of monsters. This makes the kids laugh, and lets them build confidence by winning. Highly recommended as a first board game for little ones.

I would rate this a 10 for 2-3 year olds, and it only gets a lower score because the appeal isn't long-lasting. For the right audience, however, I don't think there's a better game, and it's one of the few that a 2-year-old can learn and actually play without having to be coached.

Of course, it's always more fun to pull a monster out of the bag so you can throw it into the monster pit while yelling, "Go away, Monster!" (I mean, it's always more fun for my daughter...yeah...that's what I meant....)

Today was a banner day.  Noah played, and understood, his first board game.  He said words like "Noah's turn," "Abi's bed," "good game," and "nice job!"  He is 2 years and a week old.  

This was my daughter's first game.  We still play sometimes, but I do so with dread.  It is really an excellent game for 2-4 year olds.  I give it a 10 because it is the very first real game that any child can play.  It gets old fast for adults, but hey, if you're developing a young gamer, this is the first you should buy.

RATING: 10
(Rated as a game for 2-year-olds) She requests it multiple times daily, and really enjoys it.  I think it's a great game for her current age, as she possesses all of the necessary skills to play it according to the rules.

EDIT: Approaching three years old, this game has gone down quite a bit in my daughter's eyes.  It's still my second favorite of her games.  Look forward to playing it with her little brother in another year or so.

Update: The little boy is almost a year and a half, and he very much enjoys the game.  He can't quite line up the pieces (though he's gotten much better in the last month).  He throws down the monster yelling "Go!" when he gets one.  His sister enjoys playing it more too, given she can play with him.

RATING: 8
Rated in terms of kids' games.

Why is this game so great? Because a toddler can play it. My son wasn't even 3 yet for his first play, and he understood what to do! Any game that a 3-year-old can play and understand is a huge plus in my book. Plus, it's a cooperative game, which makes it fun for all of us to team up and discard the monsters while placing the cute little objects in our rooms. And then there's the aspect of giving someone else your tile if you already have that item in your room (sharing practice). I am just so happy to have a game my toddler can play. w00t! Thanks again, Gamewright!

As a side note, the theme is kind of weird if your kid isn't scared of monsters. We don't want our kids to think monsters are scary, so we just decided to say, "It's a monster!" and put it in the room with the rest of the stuff. The last thing I want to do is make my kid scared by playing this game!

RATING: 9
the older kids (3.5 & 6) love having a game they can play with the 2 year old. they get the idea that the game is non-competitive, and instead have fun matching items for the room colors and trading around. the youngest loves having "her game" and after a couple games of pulling out all the pieces at once and getting frustrated waiting her turn is doing very well. wish I didn't wait so long to get this...seems perfect for a young kids.

rated as a kids game, obviously.  the girl loved this one.  very interactive with the shapes and bag and monsters - she has a blast with it.  at 4 years old, i think she may have grown out of it...  but in its heyday (almost 3 to 4 yrs) it was well-worn.  

plus, it brought out the cooperative play in the little beasties, which was nice.

RATING: 8
If there's a better starter game I'd like to know about it. Our family plays this one cooperatively -- Maschino's vs The Monsters. So, for us to win, all four bedrooms must be completely furnished before we draw the eight monsters. Our youngest began playing this one just before she turned two. It's very satisfying to see our four year old play Go Away Monster with her little sister. For adults getting bored with the game pretend to have one of the monsters bite your finger when reaching into the bag. That'll liven things up. :-) (Note on Rating: I rate children's games based on how fun and enriching the game is for kids -- not adults.)

This was the first game for our twins, purchased for them when they were about 22 months old. I was quite surprised at how well it worked. They *love* taking pieces from the bag and are able to match the pieces to the shapes correctly. They enjoy drawing monsters, probably because they can laugh at Daddy saying "Go Away Monster!" Turn-taking was an initial challenge for my daughter, though she learned to deal with it rather quickly. We still start more games than we finish, their attention spans being what they are, but nonetheless they ask to play it quite regularly. Overall, this is an excellent first game and, while every kid is different, probably suitable for considerably younger kids than the 3+ years indicated by the manufacturer.

Rated as a game that is only meant for young children, and is extremely good for that group.

From 2 years old, not 3! My boy is 22 months, he's been introduced to other games (eg Haba First Orchard) and this was an instant hit, and also he knew what to do instantly (I guess having played a lotto game helped). I think what he loves most about it at the moment is pulling things out of the bag. Not that excited about monsters yet. The game is over quick which is perfect at this age.
The game is even simpler than My First Orchard and boring for my 5 year old daughter, she's happy to play with her little brother though. As such I'd say this game is for 2-4 year olds.

A cooperative game about putting tiles of bedroom objects into picturs of a child's room and tossing the monsters back in the box.  Of course, Hazel likes monsters so we usually say "Hello Monster!" and start a monster party in one of the rooms :D

The basic game isn't particularly thrilling, but you can get a little edge by the ability to feel out what you want.  On the other hand, my 2½-year-olds adore it!  They keep hoping they'll have a monster to tell to go away (they're usually pretty concerned for the welfare of the monster in our basement, what with the dinosaur down there and all), but by the end, they are equally pleased that we've all completed our rooms, too.

RATING: 7
Would be rated higher as I've played this war game more than any other by this time. Vastly superior to the overrated Paths of Glory.
The major sore spot for me is a clunky Russian Revolution trigger mechanic involving a single card "Parvus to Berlin". Tolerable but because it can be played as early as turn THREE this game will never be as good or as attractive to others as it could be.

Good idea, that's all. Poor rules, worst cards, so fixed to history that you can't outdo it.

1st. If the Ottoman goes hard from the begining for Egypt, it will surely fall. O.K. up to here, but then nothing happens! The Brit can ignore it and keep invading the Eastern Med basin as if nothing had happened to him!

On the other side, the Russians can avoid revolution by simply ignoring the Secret Persian Treaty, entering Arabistan and forfeiting 1VP!

Keep the map and counters, burn the rules, discard all the cards, write your own home rules without cards and enjoy the game!

Juego muy detallado históricamente que refleja muy bien este sector de la 1ªGM.
De acuerdo con muchas críticas que dicen que tiene demasiadas reglas especiales que ralentizan y complican mucho. Recomiendo quitar lo relativo a tribus y revueltas por Jihad que aportan poco y no tienen gran virtualidad práctica.

Same system as PoG but moves the action strictly to the near east and Balkans.

Has most of the same strengths as Paths but is knocked down a point for excessive chrome and fiddly, annoying special rules. Was it really necessary to portray the Balkan front directly in this game? The game could afford to be a bit cleaner.

Seems more scripted than PoG.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.1
Certainly more complex than PoG, this is a "chrome-fest", pretty dense and involved.

However the game can end very fast when mistakes are made, details overlooked and with bad cards timing. This may be even more scripted than PoG.

It seems the game may be made or broken in Egypt early on, so beware as the AP for not doing anything across the Suez canal too early.

Very difficult not to play the Events, hence the sentiment of the script.

Very tense for sure but it seems that the cards dictate the strategy and actions so you must like the idea of losing control. When the AP lands in the Med and the Balkans open the game becomes a very chaotic affair.

Rules are complete, their organization is passable and there is a lot of details to remember.

The positives:  Son of POG, more elaborate zoom-in on a single front, exquisitely exotic middle east/central asia locations, several kitchen sinks of chrome thrown in, to guarantee steady, repeated rules look ups.

The negatives:  Son of POG, more elaborate zoom-in on a single front, exquisitely exotic middle east/central asia locations, several kitchen sinks of chrome thrown in, to guarantee steady, repeated rules look ups!

The game's strengths are very much its annoyances too, but given I won't play this sprawling, chrome-heavy Diva but once every two years or so, I gladly put up with its quirks.  It does a great job imparting the exotic and chaotic nature of the theater.  Job well done!

And, pet rock note -- Perfect harmony between subject matter and visual presentation -- one of the few war games where solid primary colors and subdued/wild pastel color schemes for counters are both needed, and these counters are done perfectly -- a 10 for the counter art.

I liked it very much. The events are appealing and the game seems balanced. My only "thing" is the units movement factor, that seem pretty high.

Hey, just me weighing in again ... I have to say I find this game so totally frustrating because it was such a complete slam-dunk concept. It should have taken very little talent and effort to turn out a game based on this idea that was at least good, even if not brilliant. But Pursuit is such a mess, so replete with the irrelevant, so clearly unplaytested, it's really a shame.
---
The more I get into this thing, the more of a mess it seems. Recent frustration: playing the Turks, I took over Egypt. And you know what? It makes no difference. This game has all this pointless micro-complexity like detailed special rules for individual company-sized units that by all rights shouldn't even be in a *corps*-level game, but it's got NOTHING to reflect that the loss of Egypt just might, perhaps, operationally hinder the British. As it is, the Brits can still supply their invasions in Turkey and (more critically) the Levant coast without any hindrance whatsoever, the loss of Suez causes no inconvenience at all, and meanwhile critical Turkish units are strung out and out-of-position, unable to SR back, ready to be cut off by flanking invasions because the Turks thought that Egypt might, perhaps, be of an important base for the British and worth taking. Apparently it isn't.

I think this is the ultimate downfall of the game. All these far-fetched options are dangled in front of the Turkish player (Egypt, India, Persia), but the Turk would have to be insane to pursue any of them. The correct strategy for the Turks seems to hunker down and await the storm, and never to take any offensive action. OK, but it makes playing the Turks pretty dull.
---
One more comment, the scale on Pursuit of Glory feels wrong to me. Paths worked well because everyone was in constant contact, especially on the Western Front where the French and Germans and British are lined up the entire game, so there is always action and the activation tradeoffs, while still highly abstract, made some sense since a lot of what you are doing is attacking and attacking in WWI was so consuming of supplies and planning that the somewhat strange and arbitrary restrictions felt OK. I'm not sure the wide open spaces of Pursuit are as interesting, and when you're doing more moving than attacking, I think the system starts to break down and make less sense. This is just a thought though, something I found interesting to think about, it'll be a bit hard to tell for sure without more play.
---
Playing through it a bit, it's kinda fun, but really it feels like PoG with a truly astounding amount of gratuitous, excess chrome. Someone needed to take a machete to this sucker.

This is one of those totally infuriating near-misses though (see also Triumph of Chaos). First off, I think there is actually a good game in the box, but the rules are such an unforgivable nightmare on so many levels, it's hard to tell. Unfortunately, even if we accept the rules are terrible and learn them anyway, there is still too much chromy stuff in here. Not by a lot - not nearly as bad as Triumph of Chaos - but enough to ensure that this will have rules problems for some time, and not just from the die-hard CSW'ers who have rules problems with everything. This sort of game, with its fairly high luck factor and being the sort of design that is at such a high risk for rules and balance problems, just isn't worth this kind of rules volume.
---
I was really looking forward to this, had it on pre-order, and expect to see it soon. I just downloaded the rules. (*&*%! 48 pages! You have to be kidding; that might even be more than the ludicrously over-chromy Triumph of Chaos. Oh well. Worth a try, but all of a sudden this dropped *way* down on my radar. I'll go back to Clash of Monarchs; that "only" has 24 pages and is already pushing the limits of what I'm willing to go with.

RATING: N/A
Intriguing play. Many choices with every action taken. Nice components: colorful without being garish. Copious historical design notes on each of the card events. 

Lots more chrome in this one than it's predecessors. Hefty rulebook with numerous exceptions and fiddly details (a Gallipoli sub-map? come on....). Good thing the map has dozens of visual cues and textual hints or we would have been lost within the exception cloud. Rather than a b&w scan of one of the two countersheets, page 47 of the rulebook should have been an index -- would have made finding specific rules easier in the midst of play.

Players of PoG or BtB should be able to jump right into this one as it uses the same base engine and most of the mechanics are identical.

Overall a nice addition to my game collection.

Wanted to try this game, but the rules weight is ridiculous.  Obviously the designer wanted to show off all the arcana he knew about this conflict and the developers did not force him to cut the crap out.  The beauty of a CDG is it can put all the weird stuff on the cards and keep it out of the rules.  That is what made PoG so great - elegant rules, and the unique/special situations are on the cards.  The designer of this game completely missed the reason why PoG is so elegant.  

The sample game is supposed to make things clear; instead it has sentences like "The unit is removed from the game (but is not permanently eliminated)."  What the hell does that mean?

50% more rules than PoG, plus it has more stuff on separate handouts and in the play book that were in the PoG rulebook, so probably more like 65% more rules than PoG - for a much less variable, less interesting situation.  I regret buying this, and seeing the absurdly high rating for this rules mess makes me feel the need to downvote it to help warn potential buyers away.  If you are looking for an elegant game like PoG, look elsewhere.  This designer does not know how to throw out extraneous detail, or how to confine it to the event cards where it belongs in a CDG. The whole rules section on "organizing" LCUs is a classic example of needless rules weight for no benefit - especially since, when killed, the LCUs reappear on the map in the usual RP-based manner anyway.  Dead weight.

Normally I would never vote on a game I had not played, but if the rules are such that they KEEP me from playing it, that fact deserves a vote in and of itself.  Another vanity press project in the age of designer hubris, where 99% of games sold are never played and people vote on the graphics while the designer treats the rules like a history article where he can show off everything he read about when researching the project. Ugh.

I looked at the game and thought that a new Triumph of Chaos was born. All the chrome was there. I don't like chrome but I can bear it.
What I didn't know was that there was also a scripted plot, and that, I don't like at all.
When I talk about scripted I mean that the cards here are must play. You never have that PoG's feeling about choices. The card here are just "must play", or not, there is no middle ground.


This game is useful as a learning toy if you had no idea of what was going on in the middle east durign WWI.
As a game ... my vote is going down after every game (4 sessions till now), and that is not a good sign at all.

I was definitely waiting for this game and it turns out as a little disappointing product.

RATING: 8
Great game.  Some people seem to have an issue with the amount of added "chrome" in Pursuit of Glory but I don't have a problem with it as long as it adds historical flavor to the game. In the case of Pursuit of Glory, the added chrome is a very nice blend of rich historical flavor without hampering game play too much. I'm looking forward to playing this game more and predict that my impression of the game will only increase with more plays under my belt.

I think the rule book is very well written and organized.  I have ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM with the length of the rules.  I much prefer a rule book that is lengthy but complete to one that has been trimmed down to the point that it is worthless for trying to find what you need while playing the game.  

Kudos to the Stocks for a great game!

Playbook running for a 1914 campaign. Second run after a few months is a lot easier after playing through Paths of Glory. I recommend anyone new to this system to try out PoG first.

Great game that is really hard to bring to the table.
Rules are complex and require ton of work, and once you know the rules, you can't finish the game in one sitting.
But it's historical, educational and lots of fun. If you have a place to store the game while playing it over several days, this is a very fun game to play.
Both sides are asymmetrical but well balanced.
You will feel like a real war general the whole time you are playing this game.
Many hard decisions, you literally have to pick your battles, you won't win all of it, it's all about the long game. You can lose many battles and still win the war.

One play in, eh, just not for me. The chrome is rather excessive, and the rulebook that shipped with the game isn't particularly good as the living rules contain a substantial amount of errata and some of the events are confusing. We regularly got stalled looking things up while we played, and there are some annoying terminology issues, e.g. are they divisions and corps, or SCU and LCU? Just cut down on the terminology please. But, worst of all, the gameplay just isn't that interesting for the Turks who will spend the vast majority of the time playing defense.

There are some rules that, beyond the chrominess, just seem misplaced. There are too many combat modifiers that are mostly going to benefit the allies, and can drain too much tension out of the combat in a system that uses a fire table. The ability to convert LCU's into SCU's and vice-versa feels largely wasted, as the Turks don't have enough divisions to convert most of them anyway. The HQ rules feel somewhat bizarre. Comments about the apparent unimportance of losing Egypt have already been harped on by plenty of my fellow BGG'ers, too.

While I think students of the period who are particularly interested in this theater might enjoy it, it's going to simply irritate just about everyone else. So, it's not a terrible game, but there are just too many other CDG's I would rather play ahead of this, especially given the complexity.

More open than Paths of Glory with a greater number of map connections and more opportunity for sweeping maneuvers to cut supply.

But it looks and plays wonderfully once you master the rule details.

This is an awesome game that clearly was a labour of love for the designer. I could find no fault with either the rules, the play book, nor the cards. The historical commentary is highly interesting and the theatre of war is incredibly rich, varied and surprising. Very recommended not only for those who are interested in PoG this is perhaps one of the most detailed card-driven games yet (along with Empire of the Sun and Triumph of Chaos). Easy to get into if you have already played other card-driven games, but don't make this your first ever card-driven game (it might be too overwhelming)

Great game and really addictive.
The situation can change very quickly and has benefited from a lot of research. And it captures the feel of the period very well - sluggish invasion in Gallipoli, trying to advance in the desert, horrible winter in the Caucasus, the withering of the turkish army or the vacuum created by the russian revolution.

A must read book with this is Like Hidden Fire from Peter Hopkirk (the race for Kabul or Dunsterforce...)

The rules are slightly heavy, but definitely worth the investment. A lot of chrome, but that serves to capture the feel of the period.

Incredible spin-off of Paths of Glory.  Definately more complex and fiddly, but all of that is definately worth it.  Jihad, railroad links to Germany, amphibious invasions, all of it is very well handled.  The Russian Revolution mechanic is my only complaint.  All in all, it's super fun.

Edit: After a few years and 20 plays...it has begun to fall into very scripted plays.  There are some ways to do things that are just better.  Now, how the Neutrals in the Balkans, the Russian Revolution, and potential Invasions still keep it up, I've had to lower my rating.

finally played f2f after years of sitting on the shelf.

I enjoyed playing it, but I'm not sure I would want to invest the mental overhead to play it again.  Understanding all of the rules, the necessity to play some cards that are not all that useful but pre-requisites for others, and staring at the map to figure out what is and isn't important is not for the faint of heart.

I would rate this the most complex CDG I have played, and that includes Triumph of Chaos.

As the rating said, if someone really took the time to read the rules and asked me to play, I would give it another spin.  I wouldn't, however, suggest it or try to teach it to someone else.

For sure, the theme and historical detail is a huge draw.  I suspect that is the basis for the inflated ratings, rather than the fundamental soundness Pursuit has as a game.

Successfully captures the same tension of Paths of Glory, yet seems to be far more fluid a game than PoG.  Time will tell if there come to be any "set" strategies like in PoG, but I'm enjoying exploring just that.

Edit : Upgraded rating after numerous, numerous plays.  I absolutely adore the game.  Yes, it has a lot of chrome, some of which I would even take out or tinker with, but the game has proven well-balanced, fun to play and exciting at every turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A highly enjoyable while historically detailed game. The additional chrome added from Paths of Glory really enhances the game play and make complete sense when compared to the scale.

The game is very cleverly balanced while being asymmetric and still providing the players with the tense game play seen in POG. There can be several fronts kicking off at the same time which leads to tough decision making and interesting card play.

The rule book is a lot larger than POG but that is because it is more thoroughly written which is reflected in the small FAQ. The game errata is minimal so the first edition, the only one printed, needs no major addendum to the components. A credit to the designers for that and reflects the years of play testing.

I would recommend this to anyone who has an interest in the NE theatre or who enjoys POG, as long as they are fine with the additional but necessary rules overhead.

The quality of the cards and chits (badly laid out so you get some colour bleed) are not up to GMT' s usual standard which knocks a point off for me.

Oh I nearly forgot, the map is beautiful and contains lots of useful reminders including chit spaces for the play of certain events. I would have preferred mounted but that is a personal choice. 

A great game with a lot of love and attention put into its design.

RATING: 10
My favorite: Strategic - WW I - Heavy

If you have read the book'A peace to end all peace', you will understand why this game is a 10. 

I am not a big CDG lover but a few things co-incided:
1)I saw a documentary on the Berlin - Baghdad Railway
2) I visited my FLAG a week later to pick up an order when I discovered this one. Boy am I glad I picked this one up....
3) I read the book 'A peace to end all peace' 

Positive:
-One of the most evocative games I have ever experienced
-Using the PoG core you have to manage 4 different fronts, plenty of great events, great historic feel
-Great execution with a lot of things involved and this eye for subtle details that make the game what it is
-Great scale; you have serious options to choose which point to attack, move to and little bottlenecks. 
-Right scale / size; one map, sufficient units but not overwhelming. Manageble proportions.
-Right amount of chrome to support the theme and adds to the overall authentic feel.
-Great components, absolutely fair price.
-Great player aids, fantastic quick start player aid and if you have played PoG (was it even once), you can start playing after reading the Quick start and playthrough example. Well done!!
-Great evocative feel, unsurpassed historic excitement, or should I say German desperation? Guderian's Southern pincer is doomed from the start. Oka river stands in the way and he has desperately little means to accomplish his goal.
It requires extreme creativity, luck on the weather table, luck on crucial roles and Russian ignorance to pull of a win in this game.

Minus:
-Pls GMT, hardmounted board like Wilderness War!
-If you are not familiar with PoG, this is might be a hard nut to crack due to the many special rules that need to be reminded. However, once everything falls in place these things are quite intuitive and they tremendously add to the atmosphere. Time invested pays off! 
-This is not for the faint of heart and a diffuculty rating of 5 on the GMT difficulty scale is not correct imo (7 would be appropriate). Clearly an advanced game but absolutely playable thanks to the excellent player aids. 
-Can be very unforgiving -OOS- but the rules give optional rules to deal with this.
-Favors the Ottoman Empire? Well, Russian Revolutian is truly a pain for the Allies and an early Parvus to Berlin card makes it a LOT harder for the Allies to win
re of a 'historic' journey than a game. Clearly shows the amount of research, playtesting and development. Unique game with a unique theme with a tried and well tested core system.

Very impressive. Here you have serious options where you attack and the Gallipoli is nicely integrated on a special insert map.

How te get easily into the game:
1)Before you start,put the rules away first!
2)Start reading the beginners & advanced quick start notes
3)Read the unit / important reminders player aid
4)Set up the 1914 scenario
5)Play through the example game 3 times, know everything should fall into place.

Finally, let me quote fellow Geek Bentlasrsen who could not have said it better: 

'Pursuit has what it has in order to make it work as it does; it works very well indeed'

A lot of rules to digest, it's true, but it's worth it.  Gives an impressive sense of how just complicated this theater was in WWI.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Seems deeper and more intrincate than PoG or B2B. Lots of small details to pay attention to. Or it might just be that my knowledge of this WWI subtheatre is rather limited.

Some events play a much more important role than they did in PoG. This forces you to take a few long-term decisions and also adds an element of bluff that I specially appreciate in some CDGs such as Shifting Sands (my favorite game of this genre).

-----------------------------------------------

UPDATE: The more I play, the more I like it. 

No two games are similar, given the broad diversity in fronts and events. 

I don't think this game is as "mind-numbing" as has been said. In fact, the rulebook is really well-organised and it is not that difficult to find the answers to most doubts.

IMHO, all CDG fans should try this one at least once.
------------------------------------------------------

UPDATE 2: This game is fantastic. The best CDG I've ever played without a doubt. 

Every game feels fresh and new as both sides have to face new challenges all the time and every small detail counts.

So many strategic layers and nuances to take into account!!

RATING: 9
Very elegant design. Very. Some great innovations verses PoG. Tense. An absolute blast to play. A ton of historical flavor. Have played about 8 games since first picking this up a few months ago. The complexity level is about the same as PoG. Find a friend that has played PoG and they can teach you the rule changes quickly.

Like all the complex Card Driven Wargames, it will have its teething pains (the nature of designing a challenging wargame that gets played by the sharks). I'll be interested in how it stands up to the card sharks beating on it. 

This CDW, like the other complex and historically interesting long CDWS (PoG, FtP, etc) require a significant investment of time and energy. But, would you rather enjoy an opera or just another cheap, forgetable sitcom?

Either side can be very aggressive - or not - and both have MANY options for keeping their opponent off balance and fretting over the next card to play. I'd bet this one will be played ALOT and for a LONG time by the card driven wargame crowd - a tough puzzle to figure out for the poor Turks/Bulgars/Germs. Well done!

The best card-driven wargame so far, hands down. There's so much going on here: overpowered cards, wild swings of luck, as many as five fronts to fight on simultaneously, and yet it all jells. I've played it going on 50 times and it still hasn't gotten old, something I can only say about a half dozen or so of the hundreds of wargames I've played.

If you believe this game is unbalanced you're not doing something right.

You can knock it for being more complex than PoG and a bit overwrought, chrome-wise, but those factors also add to it replayability. 

On my list of best 10 wargames of all time.

Pursuit of GLory is a follow up to Paths of Glory, taking WWI to the Middle East. Effectively it goes down one level of detail (armies to corps, corps to divisions), with lots of local detail. The cards seem to play more naturally, ie it is much easier to decide how to play them: the 2/2 events are no-brainers, while you need the 4/4s to rack up the war status. Surely a lot less anguish and analysis paralysis than in Paths.

While the mechanisms are still essentially the same, there is a lot more chrome to deal with: more troops types (irregulars, tribes) and nationalities. A small inset map of the Gallipoli area, railroads, revolts, the Russian Revolution and the Jihad. This makes the game much harder to take in than just another version of Paths. There's so much you need to *know* and more rules.

SO definitely something for the CDG minded who likes a new challenge, but a bit too much for somebody to start out with.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Pursuit of Glory definitely brings more chrome to the table than Paths of Glory does. But the rules make sense and the chrome is necessary to reflect the nuances of the theater and make it a very interesting game. Another thing worth noting is the higher number of high impact events.

Rules and Game much to fiddly and full of exceptions and laden with too much chrome for my taste. I don't care much for the subject matter either, so that does not help my rating (I'm sure the few Turkish Wargamers out there will love it!). 

BTW why did they had to over-complicate the already excellent "Paths of Glory" system? This is not really what I would call a "Game". It's more an Historical study. I was very put off by the length of the rulebook and game: it was not expected.

 I did had some fun studying the cards and notes and counters and map before trying it.

RATING: 8
After one play, I like this only slightly less than Paths of Glory (one of my favorites).  It has all the same tension from having too much to do in too many places with too few cards to do any of it.  Don't be intimidated by the thick rulebook if you know Paths of Glory as most of the rules are the same.  I found picking this up much easier than learning Paths of Glory originally.

I've playtested this game for a couple years now, played two complete games, along with two intro scenarios, and one total war scenario.  The rules have changed during this time of course, but I have had a great time throughout.

It is a very intriguing campaign with lots to do.  There are several important fronts, the most important are in Iraq, the Balkans, and of course the Russian/Turkish mountains.  You can lose the game by letting the British get a foothold on the Dardanelles though or by letting them across the Suez.  The British and (somewhat less) the Russians need to worry about Jyhad, which is basically little forces popping up behind you.  Trouble everywhere!  It's great fun.

Update: Now that I actually have the game, my rating is likely to climb.  GMT did a great job with this one!

Paths of Glory on steroids.  Large number of special rules, units, cards, and situations makes it seem at times as if the game is playing you and not the other way around.  Much slower to play than POG and both players really need to have a firm understanding of the POG rules, the changes made for the Pursuit version, and read up on their sides' cards and special units.

However, the situation is interesting and you will learn a lot about this part of WW1, so it's a good game, but not great.

Well this war-game definitely opens up the Middle East and the possibilities of WWI "what-if's" in this area.  Can't help but feel that overall actions in this area are overly exaggerated in the scope of things; the Western and Eastern Fronts in comparison.  A fun war-game as it teaches obscure facts during the Great War that might otherwise have gone unnoticed.  Components are top notch the rules are weighty but as a true grognard I find them fun to read/study.

Wow! I got this game for Christmas, read the rules and setup the main scenario and realized I had no idea what I was doing. This isn't a knock on the game or its rules. I know "how" to play I just don't have any clear idea as to strategy. However I am just going to solo this by having each side just try to meet their victory conditions and see what strategies reveal themselves as the game goes on. Like most GMT games, the designers do an excellent job at providing support both here and on ConSim World.

I did expect more of the sequel of the PoG... It is a bit more complex, one of the advantages of the PoG is that ihas the perfect balance between simplicity, and reprsenting (I am not saying the game itself is perfect). In Pursuit of Glory, the mechaniscs for Islam tribes, the chits, and some other stuff, is time consuming and is not so appealing as might be expected.

Absolutely top hole! Took us 9 hours to play to late 1916 and I enjoyed every minute of it. Twists and turns lots of flavour and historical goodies. In the end the allies won by the Brits swarming over Palestine and the Indians stabbing into the heart of Iraq.I'm a great TOC fan and I rate this as highly. In fact the games seem to complement each other as TOC starts where POG leaves off. That's a tournament I'd like to see, though I'd probably have to be hospitalized afterwards. POG rules are bit messy but ultimately easier and less fiddly than TOC, highly recommended.

More complex than Paths of Glory. To cover this theater there lot more detailed rules and exceptions that require attention. Think of aggressive actions needed by the Russians and forced on the Turks in the Caucasus, Jihad with all the tribal unit... Expect the first few games to be difficult, and play them to primarily capture the rules.

I like how the designers added a lot of historical commentary, useful in a theater where there isn't much common knowledge. 

The events seem to be ignore or must play, there isn't as strong a balance between the importance of events to the ops. 

All in all an interesting game that I would like to explore some more.
Better balance - since one play the Russians could not get untracked. In another all the diversions and casualties ran the Turks out of forces to allow the steamroller to work.

I did some playtesting on this game, and that sounds like it might make me biased - it doesn't, some games I like a lot and some games I like much less irrespective of whether I helped on them or not. This game I like, a lot. I do not have the original Paths of Glory nor have I ever played it so this was totally new to me.

I think it is an excellent playing experience - full of difficult choices for the players (I disagree with the comment made that the cards must be played for their events thereby making it scripted - all cards have a choice as to how the player will use them). It is very difficult to concentrate on multiple fronts and some seemingly good choices serve only to complicate your choices further e.g. bringing in the Balkans. There is loads of tension for players

PuoG takes the PoG system to the next level. The game is harder to master, the decisions are that much tougher. Play a card for RP/OPs/SR/Event? Dunno, I need 'em all at once. Attack or defend where? Too many frontiers to make this a calm game. There is a lot to discover (concerning tactics and strategy, but also concerning the rules ...) but it is worth it.

My favorite current CDG, and it's not really close.  A very nice evolution of the POG engine, adding some fun chrome.

One impressive thing to me is that as of this writing (6/10/09) nobody has come out criticizing the game for having degenerate strategies, nor has there even been a strong consensus as to which side has an advantage.  That's a very impressive accomplishment for a game of this scope and complexity, and if it holds up I'll be surprised and even more impressed.

EDIT:  OK, it's nearly a year later and still no strong opinions about play balance forming in the community, which is absolutely stunning.  Still docked 1/2-1 point for the rules (not their complexity, but their lack of clarity at times--without the heroic efforts of Philip Thomas everyone would be playing different versions of the game), but a brilliant effort.

So you see I have "Triumph of Chaos," a similar game, rated as a "10." So why not this similar, chrome-filled exercise in CDG fun?

It's too much. I never thought I'd see the day, but it's too much chrone. There's @*#&@*( special rules for _everything_. I've played two games of this and I'm still chasing down squirrelly rules. 

Plus, having played the Turks both times... they're definitely on the strategic defensive, which makes it less fun.

I have played three full solo games of this (and one FTF).  Unlike most other owners of Pursuit I suspect, I haven't played Paths of Glory, although I've played other card-driven wargames.  

Pursuit is a blast.  It is full of tough decisions - do I play this event now for the event, or do I need to play another card for ops to respond to the problem that has emerged somewhere on the map?  Can I afford to play this card for replacement points (to rebuild lost units) or not?  Should I invade at Gallipoli?  Do I invade into Syria, despite losing a victory point due to Anglo-French rivalries?

The rules are long, longer than Paths.  This is partly because there are more special units.  But the main rules are I think well organized and reasonably easy to grasp; you will find yourself referring to the rules mostly for special cases.

Highly recommended for fans of CDGs and/or those interested in how the Great War played out in the Near East.

RATING: 8
Tentative rating based on a single campaign game.

Like Paths of Glory this game has a very nice set of core mechanics and tons of historical theme in the cards.  While this game allowed to you explore a portion of the war that is mostly ignored in Paths of Glory, I simply did not find the game or cards as interesting.  Furthermore, this game has many more special rules and all this chrome ended up slowing the game down a bit and requiring much more frequent rules lookups than Paths of Glory.  This is a very good game, but so far I can't say it is a great one.

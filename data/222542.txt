Abstract:
A puzzle game with underwater diving theme. Each player has his own board being a queue with specialized divers who slide up and down to gather resources. There is one central board (sponsors) with bonus tiles and objective cards (contracts).

Pros:
+ Nice artwork
+ Unusual theme
+ Player boards / tactile element is cool: sliding divers is fun!
+ Challenging puzzle (a lot of options)
+ Combo chains of actions
+ Private and public objectives give you goals to accomplish

Neutrals:
# Both: tactical and strategical - but more tactical with higher player counts since the central board changes more often
# Divers can be upgraded

Cons:
- Very abstract, quite dry, especially the objective cards are just generic images with no flavor text

Thoughts:
Good game but I am not thrilled about solving this kind of puzzle.

RATING: 6
This is a well designed "programming puzzle" game that actually should find an audience of gamers who want to solve programming puzzles without too much gamer interaction involved.  For me this is the kind of game wherein I respect the design, but for no easily explainable reason, I do not fall into the target audience for the game.  As such, since I don't particularly want to play the game again, the best I can give it is a 6.

Demo and picked up in Spiel 17. We had a great time playing the game with 4 players. Would have been a 8,5 to a 9 if wasn't for the packaging. The brand new game box feel kinda cheap and we cannot even close it all the way :( the components and the art is super but the game box :(( why?!?

Really great game!!! It's not super thematic but the mechanics fitting perfect to the look and feel. Cool for a quick session. For me the only point of criticism are the bennding player boards. I've pressed them flat with books. The solo variant is also fun :) Would recommend it for experienced boardgamer.

RATING: 7
Played at Spiel '17. A pretty solitary euro game of intricate action planning on your personal player board. What's to like here is the combination of a shared action track and a personal action track that triggers together.

The randomly assorted actions that everyone can execute on their board are personified as divers that move up after an action or can move up or down after spending batteries (oxygen tanks?). Actions are upgrading divers, upgrading action manipulation, getting resource cubes, getting batteries and credits and selling or buying resource cubes; Standard fare engine building.

Interaction is indirect by having shared goals to fulfill, a shared resource market and a central special action track that is used (and manipulated) by each player.

One quality concern is that the player boards on all four tables at Spiel where seriously bent, which meant that tiles that are supposed to be shoved under them don't stay on their place because of the wobbly board.

RATING: 5
The terrible warping of the player boards and main board makes it really annoying to play. It bugs me so much that I don't know if I'm ever going to play it again. To bad, because there is a lot of good ideas here. I'd give this an 8+
 for ideas and gameplay, but have to lower the score because of the warping that almost makes the game unplayable.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Unique little puzzly Euro that allows for some major strategic planning over multiple turns. Since each action potentially triggers a series of changes in the board state, you have to think sometimes three or four (or more) turns in advance to score. Of course, other players' actions might change the board state even more, in which case you'll have to adapt. Deciding when to upgrade engineers or divers is tough, and again, the better player will be able to see which option is better. 

Yes, it feels very "multiplayer solitaire," although competition over the public goals does provide some interaction, as does the spy diver, especially if you're playing with the advanced rules.

Hits all of the right notes for me. It's thinky and puzzly and seems very multiplayer solitaire, however you cannot ignore what your opponents are doing. I've only played this 2p, and I never felt like I couldn't accomplish something. I imagine the sponsor row is much more mobile at a higher player count. I'd be interested in trying it with more ppl, but I'm not certain I'd like it any better.

I'm not really sure, when it comes to rating Otys. While I'm quite confident that it sits at a 7 right now for me, I could also see this rating drop a bit with further plays. There's nothing wrong with this game. I do enjoy the puzzly nature of it and there is quite some room for clever plays. But I can't fight the feeling that something is missing. 
I can't quite put my finger on what it is but after each game I was left a bit unsatisfied. Maybe it's the missing sense of accomplishment and progression since you aren't really building something up. At the end of the game, some of your divers might be upgraded and your hacker and mechanic might be a little better than at the start. But mostly your board will be same as it was in the beginning. Maybe it's something else that will become clear with more plays or there's no problem at all and the rating might even rise. I just don't know. But nevertheless, Otys is a nice choice if you want something puzzly that plays in the advertised 60 minutes. Maybe it's just not meant to be the main course of the evening.

This game reminds me of Gold West in that it is a puzzle of planning ahead and timing. The actions you are in themselves seem simple, but there is quite some depth to them. It's probably not everybody's cup of tea, but I really enjoy this type of game.

The production quality of the game is great, the components are very nice, especially the player boards with the raised edges for sliding the tokens. The art is nice, the game looks good on the table and the insert is of high quality as well.

Die große Katastrophe hat stattgefunden. Die Welt ist komplett im Wasser versunken. Der Rest der Menschheit kämpft auf kleinen Inseln aus Türmen von Industrieschrott ums Überleben. Alles was man dafür benötigt sind gute alte Ressourcenklötzchen, diesmal eben aus dem im großen Teich. In der Kolonie OTYS koordiniert man einen Trupp von Tauchern, jeder mit einer speziellen Fähigkeit. Mit den postapokalyptischen Ressourcen Metall, Pflanzen, Treibstoff und Tech erfüllt man ganz klassisch Aufträge. Ja, auch OTYS ist nur ein Optimier-Eurogame. Pech gehabt, ihr Innovationssüchtigen. Der Weltuntergang braucht keinen neuen heißen Scheiß, das Waterworld-Szenario ist genug cooler, draufgeschraubter Industrie-Shit. Tatsächlich schiesst man Taucher um Taucher aus der Druckschleuse, wo jeder Wassermann dann seinen individuellen Job macht. Teamwork innerhalb der eigenen Crew ist angesagt: man muss schon auch vorausschauend schauen und planen, denn jede Aktion eines Tauchers ist die Vorbereitung für die Aktion des nächsten Tauchers, die die Vorbereitung für die Aktion des nächsten Tauchers ist, die die Vorbereitung für die Aktion des nächsten Tauchers ist. Wer seine Arbeit unter Wasser dann erledigt hat, taucht wieder auf an die Oberfläche und alle restlichen Taucherplättchen rutschen in der vertikalen Auslage nach unten Richtung Meeresgrund. Der themenstimmige Mechanismus macht auch haptisch Spaß, obwohl die Leimung der Spielertableaus keinen guten Buchbinder gesehen hat. Fuck the Wölbung! OTYS ist ein grundsolide gebautes, solitär angelegtes Gattungsspiel, das sich einen feuchten Kehricht darum schert, dass es von seiner Art schon Tausende gibt. Das SF-Taucherthema macht das Flair. Der französische Adult Comic Style passt prima und die Spielzeit ist mit einer schnellen Stunde auch ideal für ein Opti dieser Spezies. Die Belgier von Pearl Games, die z.B. mit TROYES und BRUXELLES 1893 schon sehr spezielle Themen-Euros herausgebracht haben, legen mit OTYS einen weiteren Charakter im Froschanzug dazu. Löblich auch der gnädige VK-Preis von Mitte 35 Euros. Solche Preisklassen für Neuheiten wird man in der Zukunft kaum noch sehen. In OTYS heisst das Zahlungsmittel übrigens Credits und ein Credit-Chip sieht aus wie eine SIM-Card aus der Generation Smartphone. Eine nette Anspielung auf das Rückwärtskatapult in ein analoges Zeitalter in der Zukunft. Auch in diesem Sinne konsequent Good New Old Eurogame.

This game is horrendous.

First, every action you can take is boring. Take one cube and... that's it.
Second the ressource cubes are not only generic but all functionally identical.
Third and most infuriatingly it is a very puzzly game that requires a lot of planning several turns ahead which other players can then mess up on a whim. Which leaves any semblance of strategy the game should have had dead on the ground.

Decent puzzle to work out.  Quick turns and enough depth to be interesting.  Easily adjustable game length.  18 points is certainly 1 hour or less. Multi-layer boards work ok.  The on top part works good but the space for your mechanic and hacker aren't so great.  Could get samey if the advanced side of the sponsors and the randomness of that isn't enough variation.  Overall I really enjoyed my first play.

Not thematic. No interaction except the spy action. Missions can be accomplished right before your turn and then you're stucked. And if you're lucky you draw a mission that you already can fulfil.

It's a fine and working game, but it lacks interaction and fun. You can puzzle alot which may be interesting, but in the end I found it very dry (pun intended) and boring.

The very indirect interaction was very underwhelming, too. You don't switch tiles actively to disrupt somsone, but yet you do it by doing what you are looking for. Those changes can be very annoying, especially with 4 players, since it adds alot chaos.

However, main thing is that the fun is lacking.

RATING: 6
So many manipulations to do during your turn and the player board doesn't really help make that painful part of your turn get better. 

It's very fiddly and often, you will have to move 6 small tokens on your player board. Sometimes, on the colony board as well... The hacker tile often goes under the board, as well as the key tokens, due to a 3-4 millimeters difference in height between the left side and the right side of the player board. 

The characters tokens often need to be put back on top of the others, and the pile of those tokens don't slide smoothly. 

I love the mechanics and the "theme", the art is very nice, but I felt every turn was a pain, due to all those manipulations on your player board. I guess most people won't be bothered by that but I unfortunately am.

What I like about the mechanics is how easy it seems to do everything when you first hear the rules and see the boards, but in the end, your brain will hurt :) The goal of the game is pretty simple: reach 18 points of "fame", by filling contracts (your own, that you can get through some actions, and the "public" ones, that everybody will try to fill before you, by upgrading characters tiles, and a few other actions/bonuses. That's where most of the interaction between players is found). You also have to be careful in how you manage your ressources. It's like everytime you need something, you're just missing that one, be it batteries or money. Planning everything precisely is absolutely necessary. With a simple set of rules, Otys managed to create a deep (no pun intended) and interesting game. Too bad I noticed how bothered I was with too many manipulations on a player board with that game. 

We will keep it in our collection for now. I want to play it with 4 players. I don't believe the 60 minutes mark is doable with 4 players. We will see about that.

Je voulais partager avec vous mon enthousiasme après notre première partie de Otys.

Groupe de 4 joueurs "expérimentés". J'avais simulé une partie 2j la veille pour apprendre les règles et testé une partie solo.
J'ai pu expliquer le jeu en moins de 20 min, sans besoin de retours à la règle pour personne ensuite. 

C'était la première partie pour tous, elle a duré environ 1h30 avec à la fin une impression très bonne pour tout le monde.
Opportunisme, optimisations, adaptation, réflexion... tout ça sur une durée d'1h à 4 joueurs une fois que l'on maîtrise le jeu... c'est top !

FIRST IMPRESSION:

While largely multiplayer solitaire, I found this one an engaging puzzle with a bit of programming involved. Different actions can be enhanced and batteries can manipulate the position of the divers. This is a race - when someone hits 18 points the game will be over at the end of the last player's turn. Points are gained completing contracts, upgrading divers, selling goods, and obtaining contract enhancements. 

Found that boards warped, we'll see if they fold back for the second play.

Clairement plus un jeu Pearl Games qu'un jeu Libellud. En revanche, je trouve la mécanique un peu poussive. Il y a en effet  beaucoup de manipulations de pousse-pousse et décalages (en faisant bien attention à ne pas louper d'étapes pour bien suivre ce qu'on fait), et une édition très moyenne à cause de ces pousse-pousse incessants ; les plateaux individuels glissent continuellement sur les tables lisses, les ressources se baladent alors... ce n'est pas pratique du tout (même si l'idée est bonne sur le papier). Bref, pas vraiment emballé.

RATING: 8
It's a race game.  That means efficiency.  I always love that.  And I love the puzzle of this game.  You always trigger the action of two tiles: one from the main board and one from the crew member tile on your board.  After you activate your crew member tile, it "resurfaces" and can't be used again until it comes down below water again.  A fun mechanic and it feels very thematic.  Tiles are always moving around, so actions are always moving around.  You really have to react in this one.  And the theme is unique too, and cool!  Fun game!

RATING: 7
Otys is a resource-gathering contract-fulfullment game that's based around a clever action sliding system. Players have eight action tiles that are arranged vertically; only the bottom five can be used. When one of them is used, that tile is moved up to the top of the stack and the rest of the tiles slide down. Additionally, the marker associated with that slot is also used, and the slot can't be re-used until all slots have been used. Naturally, there are ways to manipulate the tile order, as well as get your slot markers back earlier. Resources gathered at each slot stay associated with that slot, and contracts can only be filled from a single slot. I thought this system was really neat. However, it did seem too easy for an inexperienced player to get stuck in a cash rut if they didn't take benefits that would get them more cash early, as many of the action tiles are unusable without money (including those that would net more money in the long run).

It's a sort of puzzle-style game where you're involved in a point race. If you want to develop your 'engine' too much, you'll probably be too late, but some investment in extra's or upgraded divers in the beginning of the game certainly won't harm you. I liked my first game, especially as it was quite tense for whom would win.

A fantastic puzzle game. There is so much to think about on this great game to try to make it all come together. The way the divers are moving around, the bonus actions move, level activation tiles, collecting resources on the correct levels, etc... So, much to plan for and consider! It could be a real brain burner, but I didn't come out of it completely mentally exhausted. They found the perfect length of play for this game. You really need to be careful as the end of the game approaches to know your opponent might end it at any moment (especially if they are holding any goal cards in hand). With that in mind it does seem to favor the player that starts in last position since they are able to react to a game end triggering move.

Excellent and unique design. I love the art direction, the puzzley nature, and the timing element is delicious. Otys is a sleeper hit I think.

I never give notes to my games. I do it this time because:
- Otys is a wonderful adventure with Libellud,
- I'm disappointed that as soon as a game is a bit lighter, it has bad grades on BGG,
- I am disappointed to see a 1 because of a hardware problem that can be solved,
- Otys is maybe my favorite Pearl Games,
- I am very tired.

A largely solo game. You don't have any interaction with the other players besides snaking out objectives from under them or using the spy action. If you don't mind this, what you end up with is a nice, puzzle where you need to plan out your actions 3-4 turns ahead. We played with 4 people, and the game goes pretty quick once you get the hang of it. I enjoyed it. Would I buy it? Maybe if it was on clearance/used. I would like to see a solo variant.

Weird game where you have to sequence actions while trying to plan for actions, associated with specific locations, moving around semi predictably. Huh?  

Everyone has a player board with a sort of conveyer belt (slots 1-5, plus a kind of staging area for several slots before #1) of actions. Everyone has the same set of actions, in randomized positions on the belt. Each round, everyone chooses an action (1-5) to take. Actions might manipulate the board, allow you to buy/sell cubes from central board, get cubes, get a contract, etc. If you manage to collect the right set of cubes in one conveyer slot, you can fulfill the matching contract for VP. After your turn, that action moves to the top slot and pushes actions down the conveyer. Some of the actions modify your own abilities (e.g., more flexibility in choosing actions or cube bins).

We got a rule wrong, maybe 2, but still good. Kind of fun, with the multiple levels of planning, but strange!

Players have a board with a queue of divers who, if activated, typically return to the surface. Depths are labelled 1-5 and activating a diver at one also grants a bonus corresponding to that level. The aim is to collect sets of cubes to fulfill contracts, with various other actions improving action efficiency (one diver collects blue cubes, one white, one green etc.; one allows buying/selling cubes from the market; one allows faster re-activation of divers). In an included variant, one diver can interfere with adjacent opponents.

Production is lavish, with an amazing velcro insert and two-layer boards with grooves for divers to slide up and down. 

It's a race to points and a tolerably engaging optimization puzzle. Unfortunately, the sponsor bonuses are significant but can move frequently, inhibiting planning -- seems likely best with two players.

Essentially a solo puzzle game.  There is only accidental interaction with your opponents.  Beautiful presentation and kind of fun albeit a little fiddly.

Nice little lighter puzzle game where u are never without options to score points every round if u put minimum effort into your planing of diver locations. 

X-tokens tumble the bonus actions just like your divers go from location to the top wich makes for some intressting combos. 

Batteries are by far the most fun together with a high level of macanic. Lets u push divers where u whant them assuming u have that many upgrades on your mecanic. 

Overall a enyojable game u can push through in less then 1h. 

Yes other players can screw up
Your plans but if u plan all your moves to take just 1 specifik contract well then neither this game, splendor, elysium, sentient or games like that are for u.

Played a partial demo at Gen Con 2017 soley because I was walking past and saw the beautiful splash art.

The art is beautiful, and some of the mechanics are interesting.

However, the theme feels kind of plastered on.

I won't call it a reskin, but it's a bit of an iteration on games like Splendor, Century Spice Road, or others where you turn resources into points. 

Most frustrating is how scarce money is when half the workers cost a money to use. It quickly devolves into a slog of "what am I physically able to do" rather than a choice of "what move best benefits me." In spite of what this game does right, it's another efficiency puzzle, but without an efficient design.

Okay game with an interesting (though sometimes quite difficult to wrap your head around) action selection mechanism.  The relatively small victory point goal (18 points) seems to reward small combos and not nearly as much engine building as the rest of the game allows.
Fairly quick and interesting for at least a play or two, but I'm not sure how much I would want to come back to it.

From the first overview it seems like a deep game (no pun intended) with easy streamlined mechanics. Could be right up my alley

Post apocalypse sunken civilization waterworld euro race to program and unlock conveyored display of special powered divers at leveled depths to set-collect salvaged resources that will fill contracts and even get the aid of sponsor upgrades when possible.  Interesting puzzle creates some good thinky planning of all the shifting variables.  It sort of fits the theme I guess but plays more like an abstract programmed strategy puzzle to me—but that doesn’t detract.

Good feeling after 1 game.
Player boards generally bent due to poor production (pasting).
But great mechanics, requires anticipations/planning, and nice combinations.

Beautiful looking game with an interesting theme - and obviously coated in some kind of super slick coating that made EVERYTHING extremely glossy (the only cards I've sleeved to give the cards more grip...). At its heart an action selection game, but there's an awful lot to consider when taking that action, which diver to activate, which position you want them in etc. The more I play this one the more I enjoy it.

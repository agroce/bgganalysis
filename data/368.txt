The 'balance' mechanic of this game attempted to score zero or the least points is actually kind of interesting. But the barely serviceable trick taking skeleton make it very plain Jane boring. 

The theme makes the game outright dumb. The cards are really stupid and potentially even offensive when they aren't merely being insufferably generic about women vs men in relationships. The trite gender roles and banal tropes make this something I don't even want to see on the table.

RATING: 7
Actually a tight little trick-taking game. The restricted-card perfect-information variant might be a little more interesting, but there's nothing wrong with the base game. Yes, Uberplay's "relationship" theming is ridiculous, but not really offensive. I hope someone re-releases this as just Tightrope, or an abstract re-theming would be just as good.

Reminds me of trick-taking games.  The high/low variable weight of each round makes it a bit more complicated, but of course the lack of multiple suits makes it simpler.  Not bad at all, and the cards are very amusing.

Surprised by how much I enjoyed this game. The theme made me think there isn't much there, but I can see the mechanics potential to be a nice occasional replaceement for Coloretto and For Sale in the light, filler category. A little luck of the draw moves it from a 7 to a 6 for me.

Underrated auction game saddled with an unfortunate relationship theme.  Could only get on the table a few times with our group, but its too light for my gf and I.  All pieces confirmed to be present.  Almost brand new, only because of a light crease in the manual.  

Brand new, Intact shrinkwrap.  Free shipping in CONUS, will pay $10 towards shipping otherwise.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Good strategy options hide the fact that there really isn't a theme here at all.  I definitely recommend you play with the variant that limits the numbers of the cards involved in the game.  One major drawback is that there is virtually no way to recover from a bad hand.  Also if you score a zero on the first hand you don't get the added bonus that players get if they score zero in a later hand.

I'll give this a 7 right now as we all enjoyed the game.  An easy card game in the vein of many of the fillers, but it's different because of the balancing.  The theme used for this is awful as I almost couldn't get it played because of it.  But once we started playing, we ignored the theme.

RATING: 6
An okay trick-taking game.  I'm not a big fan of this genre, but I like the stress of trying to stay "balanced" in this game.  I also like the fact that you can make the game more strategic (much like 6 Nimmt!) by playing with cards numbered 1 through 9xN (where N is the number of players).  You can even make the game more casual by choosing cards simultaneously (as in basic 6 Nimmt!).

RATING: 7
This is a good trick taking game, but I see it more as a press your luck game. Starting with the idea that you want to take no tricks at all, if you figure you will have to take a trick eventually, you want to time it so that you end up taking two or more that will balance each other out. You might end up getting screwed if your opponents want to deprive you or stick you... Silly theme that was funny on the first go around but I'm not sure of its humor value over time. Good mechanics though.

I'm not crazy about the theme, but the game is pretty good, I like it best when each player plays their card one at a time, but having all player flip their card at the same time was not bad either, kinda gave it a category 5/slide 5 feel.

Really a card game that doesn't need a theme.  Intriguing focus on balance, which makes it difficult to know what card to play at times - the sign of a good game.  Simple mechanic that works well.  Funny art on the cards.  I have the German Tightrope edition.

This was a lovely game once you caught the rhythm of picking and discarding the colored sticks to your advantage. It's all about hand management and knowing when to play you best cards (the lowest and the highest) in minimizing the penalties of winning tricks. The simultaneous revealing of cards variant plays incredibly fast and is more fun IMO.

Another excellent twist on trick-taking games. You must balance your blue sticks and red sticks (they cancel each other out).  Low score wins.  As game develops, you find yourself wanting to LOSE hands in order to reduce the number of sticks you won in your previous hands.

Rather good trick taking game. Highest and lowest cards played to a trick take a number of blue or red sticks respectively. The idea is to take a balance of sticks as red and blue cancel each other out. Lowest score after several deals wins. There are a lot of laughs in this game, as players struggle to minimise damage via bad hand deals.

RATING: 4
This auction game certainly has a strange and in most people's opinion a very poor theme.  Everyone is going to be dealt a hand of cards with a numerical value between 50 - 1 (maybe 40 - 1) and each round a relationship card is going to be displayed.  Each person, in El Grande style, is going to play a numerical card.  The person who played the highest takes X blue sticks and starts the card playing in the next turn, the person who played the lowest takes X pink sticks and the one who played the middle number takes nothing.  X is the number on the relationship card which will be from 1 - 9. Sticks give you negative points but blue and pink sticks cancel each other out so you will only ever have sticks of one color in front of you and the strategy is to get sticks of the opposite color you have to get the fewest sticks possible.  It sounded good in theory but in the end is a pretty random filler auction game.  I'm sure there are better choices out there.

A sufferer of 'terrible game theme syndrome.' A different game just by virtue of its scoring mechanism. Three felt a little too little and five a little too much, so by deduction I would guess it's best at four. Another tanga buy. Can't turn down a cheap Reiner game.

[Original comment] Easy to play, but if you get dealt the wrong cards, it's virtually impossible to win. Good game for younger players. We usually play with 5 or 6 people, which probably impacts the chances of winning.

May 2009 -- Our version is the original German with pictures of a man balancing on a tighrope. It's not one of my favorites, but I'm willing to play it again.

If I saw this in a game store, the odds of my purchasing it based on the theme would be slim to none. If it had retained the simple "tightrope" theme of the German version, I would have at least had a look and considered it. Now that I've played it, I can say that it is a fun trick-taking game. Bidding? Bidding, you say? There's no real bidding here, people. It's a trick-taker with the twist that you want to avoid being the one to play the highest and lowest cards into the trick. If you can make it through an entire game playing the middle card in every trick, you can win easily. Naturally, it's not that easy. The idea is to have the fewest sticks, which you take by playing the high or low card, based on the number of the card turned over from the face-down deck (this is where the "bidding" comes into play). If you've taken any sticks by being low or high, then you have to figure out how to get rid of them. High card takes blue, low card pink. It makes for a nice twist on trick taking, and I like trick taking, so I would consider playing this again.

Received as a "sweetener" to Basari in Math Trade, 2/20/09, from Matt C.

It's not as bad as you might think it's going to be. I think the theme just kinda sticks in your craw though and sours your taste for the game even though the mechanics are decent for a filler.

[Drahtseilakt] Eight plays. It's a toss-up between this and Die Sieben Siegel as my favorite card game for more than two players. Very simple, very clever, and a little bit deeper than it might first appear. Works well with any number of players in the range.

Decent.  It has an interesting mechanic in that you are trying to keep your score at zero, rather than minimizing or maximizing your score.  I think that with a rules change in which your hand is passed to the next player instead of getting redealt would help quite a bit.

Fun, simple and well designed card game.

Artificial but ok theme -I really don't see why some people find it so bad...

We played with the discarded event cards all revealed, making card counting a little too easy for my taste. I'm not sure if that is standard play or a variant. The game is clever and rewards balanced play. The cards are funny in a stereotypical sort of way (Relationship version). Poot!

RATING: 6
First played August 14th, 2007.  This is a quick learn (<5min) and quick play.  We played as 3 player.  There is a decent balance of luck and strategy to this as well.  You can learn a bit about your opponents as the game progresses.  I'd recommend giving this a gameplay if you know someone who has it.  It is a different kind of trick taking game that may interest those out there who would like another trick taking variant.  Your best bet is to be in the middle of the cards played between 1 and 50 to take the least amount of points.  Low score wins.

Feb08: Not a bad little trick taking game.  It's quick to explain, and the art can be amusing (Or offensive if you are of a delicate mind set.)

I'm not sure how often it will make it to the table though.  Time will tell.  I think I much prefer Bottle Imp or Stichlen.  They just offer a few more meaningful decisions.

Jul08: Yea, hasn't come out again.  Still, not bad for the super cheap price it was.

Initial Rating: 4.0 (August 2011)

This is the game that disenchanted me from Mr. Knizia, before this I always thought everything he did was pure gold but Relationship Tightrope brought me to reality. I no longer buy Knizia games without having tried them before. I acquired this game when I was relatively new to the hobby. This was one of the first games I really hated playing (now I have a lot more, including a couple more from Mr. Knizia).

The theme doesnâ€™t help the game, very boring.

Itâ€™s been years since I played this so I really donâ€™t remember the rules or why I dislike it (it was pretty straightforward though). I will give it one last chance but (more likely) I will sell it.

I finally played the game again and this time I had much more fun than before. We were 5 players but we all were laughing. This makes me think the game is hugely dependent of your game group. I still think the game is mediocre at best, but I would play it if IÂ´m in the right mood. I already sold my copy of the game.

The rules are very easy to teach and the game time is rather short. The decisions are, more or less, very easy.

I have had good results introducing this game to non-gamers.  I attribute this to the clean, non-intimidating graphic design.  People enjoy passing the little wooden sticks back and forth.  I'll pass on the re-theme.  Relationship tightrope?  That theme must have been approved by a bachelor.

Relationship Tightrope is an enjoyable card game.  Opponents can hinder progress unexpectedly and cause issues so playing the right card at the right time is incredibly important in order to balance out and get the lowest score.  I didn't really expect much from this title, but I was rewarded with a good little card game.

The humorous relationship theme would seem to limit the interest to couples playing. You have a random hand of cards for bidding on cards numbered 1 to 9. You are trying to either bid high and win blue sticks or bid low to win pink sticks. Equal numbers of blue and pink sticks cancel each other. You start out with a hand of nine cards so you have some flexibility in early bidding. As you get down to the last couple cards you don't have as many options and can end up unlucky and stuck with a bunch of sticks. There are better fast playing auction games such as For Sale.

Another fun, innovative and quirky trick-taking game.  One of the few (light) trick-taking games that can be scaled well for 3, 4 & 5 players.  I suspect with enough cards, it would be just as fun with 6 or more players but with a bit more chaos thrown in (just like 6 Nimmt!).  Scaling with three is easy enough by only using cards #1 - 30 (or #1 - 33).  You can vary the total amount of cards depending on your groups taste for high luck to low luck versus no luck at all.

I own the german version, Drahtseilakt, as I really didn't care for the Uberplay's edition with their very uninteresting theme.  Plus, I can't see their blue & red numbers on score cards from a table-length's distance away.  I thought that the original Drahtseilakt/Tightrope concept was fantastic already (big plus, was that the trick numbers on the cards are much clearer in the German edition, not camouflaged against the background art).

Trick taking game in which the highest card and the lowest card both recieve points/sticks that can be removed through winning future tricks.  Really hokey theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Light game in which one must try to either avoid taking points for playing the highest/lowest cards in a trick or try to balance the number of points in both high and low tricks that one takes.  I tend to dislike "Hearts"-like card games in which one avoids taking points. This has much of the feel of 6 Nimmt to me in that you're trying to deduce what other people might play but there is a large element of chaos because it's difficult to know what cards they have in their hand at a given time.  Ultimately, I would say that I like this slightly more than that game as the cards are not played simultaneously (in the standard version).

Neat little card game where you either get blue sticks for the high score, pink sticks for the low score or nothing if you manage to be in the middle. Kind of a trick taking feel and we played it a bunch for a while. Now I don't play as much with the group and we have rather moved on. Plus my wife doesn't care for trick-taking games. So this sits unplayed, with the oddball theme somewhat putting people off too.

Tanga deal!

This game is like Raj with a twist.  Everyone is going for a zero score, not the max score.  So what you might need for a zero score is likely different than what someone else needs.  However, you may want to block someone from getting a card they need, even if it hurts you.  In the end, I'd say I enjoy this game more, with the exception of when I just want a filler.

RATING: 8
The best trick-taking game I know, but with two 'winners' on each hand instead of one. Very rich, yet very simple and fast (45 minutes), the game forces players to create strategies (sometimes, very aggressive ones) depending on their starting hands. The randomness of the 'prize' cards can spoil everything, but there is always a way to recover...

I recommend the original Drahtseilakt over the strange-themed 'Relationship Tightrope'.

The game is rather like Turn the Tide. There are two decks of cards: 50 that are numbered 1-50, and another dozen or so "value" cards that describe the payout for each trick. Generally, the highest card played will win a number of blue stick-tokens, lowest wins a (different) number of pink tokens. The aim is to be close to "balance" (the same number of blue and pink) at the end of the game. There are some "special" cards that change the way payouts are determined, but they don't alter the overall goal. 5/10

RATING: 6
In each of the 9 rounds, a tightrope card gets drawn valued between 1 and 9 and this signifies how many sticks are up for grabs. Each player plays a card (valued 1-50), the high card gets that many blue sticks, the low card gets that many red sticks. There's also a red 0 tightrope card and a blue 0 tightrope card which make the next card only worth blue sticks / red sticks respectively, a randomising factor. For scoring, the reds and blues cancel out ... the balance left over in either colour is your score, low score wins. There's 2 ways to play - the fast pretty random simultaneous reveal, or the play in clockwise order where you try and avoid the lead but the turn order can be just as randomly decisive and the games take longer. You can also play with cards left out for lightness, or the exact right number of cards (# players * 9) to appeal to the card-counters. I think the game has too many random factors to warrant the effort of a more serious approach so we play the lighter faster versions. Even then, the game doesn't offer too much reward other than as a filler passing time. If you start with a high hand, win low tightrope cards with your high cards and try to get as many red as you can as the blue will eventually fall your way. And vice versa. Sometimes you just get shafted by your hand and there's not much you can do. It doesn't come out often as a result.

A game that was sitting on my shelf for the LONGEST time. You need 3 people to play which was always the problem. With a name like relationship.... you would think it would play 2p. It doesn't. It is a tug of war game with a hand of numbered cards. It can totally just be luck of the draw at most times but it is still cute. I own it and will continue to do so. It might get played again in the future. Cute enough and easy time killer.

RATING: 6
The concept is refreshingly different: maintain a near zero score by 'buying' negative (pink) and positive (blue) values. These values go respectively to the lowest and highest bidding cards played, which modifies your current score. For interest for those who like to work out the -/+ values in play and how to arrive at zero. The only elements I like are that two cards cancel out one of each colour value so the maths solution won't be perfect and adds some angst; and if you get zero at the end of a round, you can stratch off your highest score from a previous round- wonderful hope instilling catchup rule. The Uberplay edition instills some visual humour in what is a dry exercise rather than a game. And strangely enough, the unique bidding cards and the maths involved makes it difficult to tune in and "relate" to your players.

A fun light trick taking game where you are trying to balance two different types of points.  It doesn't matter if you take a lot of one color if you can take as many of the other color.  It's as viable a strategy to try and take the two different types of colors so they cancel out as it is to try and not take any points.It hardly needs to be said again but the Relationship theme is not so great.

Please note that I speak of the original edition, "Drahtseilakt". The retheming for the new edition mostly killed the game's charm and I urge anyone to track down the old version. Which is, in my opinion, Reiner Knizia's best offering. The most tactical trick-taking card game ever devised. Always a chance for a comeback, no matter how behind the winner you are. And NO "special" cards!

This is a fast, fun game of some basic math.  It can be played strategically, or as a light game of chance.  Each round you play a card.  "Points" (in the form of colored sticks) are awarded to the highest card and lowest card played.  The two different colored sticks cancel each other out (-1 vs +1).  At the end of the game the person who has the lowest absolute value wins.

RATING: 8.1
Relationship Tightrope -- Great filler. Light, but satisfying.

While I don't care for the current theme, I really like the artwork. In terms of theme, I'd like to get the "Drahtseilakt" version.

What makes this game work is the "Instant Forgiveness" value zero cards. They reduce predictability without resulting in chaos.

Nerdy digression:  In Relationship Tightrope, femininity is associated with the lower numbers. At the risk of sounding politically correct, this sends a ridiculous message unnecessarily. Without changing gameplay at all, one could have each card depict two different but complementary numbers: For example, a blue 50 and a pink 0; or a blue 12, and a pink 38. Et cetera (Pairs always adding to 50). In this way, the game plays exactly as before, but instead of high numbers taking the masculine blue and low numbers taking feminine pink, high blue takes blue and high pink takes pink. For example, in the current version, when comparing a 47 with 3, 47 takes blue and 3 takes pink. In the complementary version, when comparing a [blue 47 / pink 3] with a [blue 16 / pink 34], blue 47 beats blue 16, so blue 47 gets blue, and pink 34 beats pink 3, so pink 34 gets pink. While this description may sound involved, the actual play would mean simply comparing like-colored numbers. This is very much in keeping with the original theme of weights on the left and right sides of a tightrope-walker's balance pole, while also appropriate for the re-themed masculine/feminine version.

Drahtseilacht (would never play the Relationship Tightrope version): As usual Knizia pulls off a fabu math equation with cards.  Some light decision to somewhat mitigate extreme luck.  A good time killer.  I most liken this game to speed wobbles.  If you ride a skateboard and you start to lose control, by going down a hill too fast, you start to wobble back and forth and it gets quite difficult to stabilize.  If you can make it to the bottom in control without letting your board wobble once it is an otherwise easy ride.  I won so I'm not sure if there is any skill involved.  Overall though, I think that Fire Imp uses many of the same concepts to a better effect.  As for the blind bidding version I like Zum Kuckuck (Land Unter) as it factors in the concept of the sticks into the card play itself.  Still it is quite fun, and can be rather dramatic.

What an atrocious theme, or was it meant to be over the top sexist so one can make fun of it? Nevertheless, it would be good to hunt down one of the differently themed re-implementations because the game under all this is really good and a lot of fun. A great filler where you bid with cards to mostly land in the middle, with the highest or lowest score you gain either blue or pink sticks and the goal is to be as balanced as possible (=0). It plays in a similar field as "For Sale", light and quick this can be played with almost anyone, good night opener. We played with 3 which worked very well but bigger numbers should be fine, too.

Well, look at that!  Pink roads!  And a game whose theme is even more pasted on than "Balloon Cup" (I didn't think that was possible)!  But at least the theme adds a bit of silly humour to what would otherwise be a pretty dry mathematical exercise.  Having said that though, this game does a very good job in its role as a fun, fast-playing, multi-player filler.  It is very portable, takes only a few minutes to learn, and has just enough tension and strategy to make it fun.  Game design: 3/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total: 5.5/10

[Uberplay 04 edition] {Love; trick-taking; scalable} {basic 6; set-up variant 6.5} RT is unique for its scoring rules, where a player has to alternate highest and lowest plays. RT is funny and fast-placed. Though it's unique and funny, it's just an average game because it is quite static. The only dynamic factors are the missing cards and the blue/red 0 score card. If you have limited budget, you can consider other card games of Knizia, such as High Society.

The relationship theme is attractive; esp. when you have a fussy girl friend :laugh: The game is somewhat over-priced. (maybe the sticks are expensive)

RT is moderately luck dependent. The scoring rule favors aggressive players. There is a typical strategy - avoiding making the biggest offer in the last few rounds because it's difficult to control the results when leading.

The set-up variant for different number of players could be used. It adds a card counting element to RS and makes RS more tactical. The simultaneous-action variant should be avoided, though. It could shorten the game time but it adds too much chaos.

A man isn't complete until he marries....then he is finished.

Before I go bludgeoning this game's theme - let me first proclaim how delighted I am that it allowed me to share that classic quote above.

It is common knowledge that in many games,  most notably Knizia games,  theme is largely treated as an afterthought.  To some,  theme is inconsequential,  while others place a high premium on it's relevance. I began this hobby somewhere in the former camp and as time went on,  gravitated towards the latter.

Relationship Tightrope is a simple hand management game of balance.  I was introduced to it as a blind bidding game - and it works quite well that way.  It surprised me to discover that it was,  in actuality,  a variant.  I only tried the conventional way once and quickly returned to the blind bidding - as it is my much preferred method.  Whichever way you choose to play,  it is unusual to have this type of versatility available in a game - and since they play quite differently,  the game's accessibility is greatly broadened.

 Despite it's preposterous theme,  the game play rises above the ashes in grand fashion.  It is quick, tight and doles out a fair dose of fun.

I suggest you look beyond the warts and uncover the beauty within.  It is a light enough game where the distraction is virtually negligible.  Of course,  I also own the German version Drahtseilakt - but that is more a testament of how much I like this game,  than a case of blatant hypocrisy.......I think.

This was among the first Euros I ever played, and I really enjoy it.  I've actually played it two different ways, using a simultaneous reveal selection process, and also playing cards in turn, like playing a trick.  I think I prefer it the latter way, since otherwise it's a bit too similar to Land Unter, but the former way gives the game a bit more chaos, resulting in more laughs.  The management of high-low cards is interesting to me, as is the scoring mechanism using the sticks.  Highly enjoyable.

The worst thing that happened to this game was being re-issued with the sexist theme.  I proudly own Drahtseilakt, instead.

Excellent, fun, quick filler - in same category as 6 Nimmt, Lasscaux, No Thanks and the like.

Light card game where the goal is to take the same number of male and female penalty points (which cancel each other).  Does this mean two wrongs make a right?

For a category of card game I thought I left far behind, I was surprised at the short-term joy I found in this one.

In the future, I wouldn't dive out a 4th story window to avoid it.  Even on the 2nd floor I might not be tempted to crack a window. 

[Rating assumes you're not playing the thematically abhorrent Relationship Tightrope version.]

This is a neat little game. Try to collect the least blue or red sticks. Since they cancel out, 4 reds and 6 blues = 2 blues. I really like that part of the strategy. You can collect a big number and still get back to zero.

Wow this is a fun little trick taking game! So good that I'm willing to overlook the stupid theme and art. If you like light trick-taking games and you get a chance, play this - you won't be disappointed.

The theme of this game is tragic.  Luckily, the theme can be ignored.  It is a fun and unique bidding game.  Each auction, the high card takes blue sticks and the low card takes pink sticks.  Pink and blue cancel each other out.  Try to have no sticks by the end of the hand.  Also, a perfect score of zero allows you to negate a score from a previous hand.

This is a really decent filler.  It's super cheap as well.  Pick it up.

Yes, the artwork is stupid.  Pick it up anyway.

Feels like you should be able to affect your opponents more, but really each player is playing in isolation.  Still a solid, light game.

I'm glad I won this from a Garrett's Games and Geekiness and didn't actually pay anything for it. Not only is the theme completely pasted on, but reading the values of the relationship cards is next to impossible without picking it up from the table. There are so many much better trick-taking games that this one won't see any play. I kept the cards numbered 1-50, the colored sticks, and threw out the rest.

This one's good.  Quick and clever, but a bad deal can certainly screw you.

Horrible theme, fun little bidding game. If you can pick it up cheap do so!

Fairly random but the game itself is actually pretty fun, I did get several laughs out of our session.  Can't really plan your card plays too much since someone will always inevitably take the trick from you, whether it will help him or not.  Would definitely play again.

A tricky trick-taking game.  Sometimes you can get away with avoiding taking any tricks, but more often, you just try to balance the reds and blues you take, lest you end your tightrope act in shame....

I didn't hate the theme outright.  Interesting concept overall but I'll have to play it again to see if the interesting mechanism overcomes the luck.

The biggest problem I see with the theme is that it is supposed to be about relationships, but it is for 3 or more players.

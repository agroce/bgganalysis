This was not that interesting of a game in my mind. Strictly worse than Coup in every way. Rules were unclear and the end game led to some very weird and unthematic choices "Quick, wastelander, shoot the other wastelander so you both win!" Also, the ray guns were ridiculously too large and fell over. Box seemed ten times too big for what the game was.

Played it twice in a row: first time the rules didn't gel well, and the second time it wasn't that fun either. Most of the time people just figured out who was who and then duked it out, without much deduction or conflict.

AVOID. 2017, 4-8p, 25 min., re-implementation of Good Cop Bad Cop, which is a bluffing, deduction, and take that, party-style game.  Not my type of game.

Half of the game your turn consists of checking someone else's card. Exciting! Rules are far more convoluted than they should be for a game like this. Hilariously oversized box for two small decks of cards.

*5* (Initial plays)
Very similar to good cop bad cop but with addition of waste landers. I was not impressed with this game, over produced for what it is. Gameplay was anti-climatic with swingy artifact cards. Would much rather play Coup.

Leaders is a good deduction style game. The ray guys are amazing looking. Due to the artifacts in the game, the game requires a little more teaching as these play a big role in the game. It also played well at 8 players and took 1 hour to do.

I like this better than Good Cop, Bad Cop. Player elimination has been dealt with, the plastic ray guns (kickstarter) are a fun over-production, I like the art and the names/effects of artifacts are great. It is overall a slick "deluxe" version of Good Cop Bad Cop.

Good for a group of 8 easygoing, fun and social people who don't try to min/max everything and take victories/defeats too seriously, but still care about the game. I'll admit, we're suckers for the overblown production in the deluxe edition--the ray guns are fun to hold and point at each other. I love that there's no player elimination, and while that makes for some interesting winning conditions (read: disliked by some), I appreciated everyone having a stake in the game till the end, with some unpredictable, wild swings in allegiances. Can make for a good, dramatic story, but will piss off gamers who want lots of control.

Usually don't like deduction games. But this is a fun and very fast paced filler game.

RATING: 8
Expansions:
- Artifact Pack #1

Nice fast paced group game that's open to people bluffing/convincing and some fun back and forth between trying to shoot each other.

Artifact cards allow people to greatly influence the outcome of certain actions, which adds a nice layer of strategy on top of the simple social deduction/bluffing layer.

So good!  Not a replacement for my favorite hidden identity/social deduction game, Secret Hitler, but a great new experience nonetheless.  Was a little confused as to how the interactions worked in this game at first not knowing how to know enough about others' identities.  Once I discovered the nuance of "Oh, now I know you know what I know about that person" it all fell into place.  I have brought several non-gamers into the fold with this game and that is a win in my book.  Keeper.

[Kickstarter] I liked the switching teams concept and usage of artifacts. There are a lot of things to track so playing with 8 was a bit hard but still fun. This has some cool twists to the party deduction games genre. Got rid of it since I have enough social deduction games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice social deduction game that eliminates the awkwardness of coming up with questions on the spot while still retaining bluffing and teamwork.  The lack of questions makes this a great game to play with kids. Easy to accidentally let information slip -- if that bothers you then this game is not for you.

This is a much improved version of Good Cop Bad Cop.  The new mechanics and artifact cards make the game more enjoyable.  I also like the introduction of the Wastelander team so that no player is eliminated.

PnP copy.  It's fun for a large group that likes to accuse others of stuff.

RATING: 7
Fixes some of my biggest  complaints about Good Cop Bad Cop! Wastelanders are fantastic, and the artifacts in this one are much better. I also REALLY like the inability to pick up a gun/play an artifact if you don't have a face down alignment card.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Much better than good cop, bad cop, but still a mediocre game.  The game is pretty much driven by the cards, not the choices the places make, so it feels like it's on autopilot.

Much better than most party style games since there is some agency involved, and far better than BANG! or BANG! The Dice game.  I don't have much desire to play this by choice, but I wouldn't decline it if requested.

This seemed completely unnecessary to me. Not only is the theme a lot less universally acceptable, but the rules feel more like Good Cop Bad Cop 1.5 rather than an improved game overall. Getting rid of player elimination is good, I guess, but I don't like that this makes it so you can have a solo victory. That rewards sub-par play, in my opinion, and it's not like games of this go on forever. Not playing for 5 or so minutes isn't the end of the world.

This is fine if your group can get into the theme, but I'll stick with GCBC and its many expansions.

Like the first Euphoria game, feels a little 'off', as if something was fine-tuned to a group but not playtested widely enough with others. A cogent theme would work better than sub-sci-fi nonsense.

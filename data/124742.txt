Very interesting, very different than MTG, and very hard to get a grasp on the rules. This has a massive barrier to entry to learn the game, even if you have played tons of MTG like me. Sometimes the element of the unknown for the runner is too high, but it doesn't ruin the game.

(As of 05/06/14 I still haven't played face to face with a real person, and this will allow for a full opinion of the game.)

No. We tried it. The mechanics seem ok... 
After 3 games we decided that there are way better games out there. It seems to me to have an unfounded hype.

Possibly the best game ever. I'm a board gamer. I love board games. I love Euro games with lots of fiddly bits, I love simple fun family games, I love abstract games. I'm not a huge fan of dungeon crawlers, luck based games or coops.

This game though; it's amazing in it's complexity and amazing in it's flavor. I love the asymmetry and can never make up my mind which I prefer to play, runner or corp.

If I had to choose one game to play forever it would be Netrunner.

Extremely solid LCG - it deserves to be as popular as MTG - but the rate of new releases far outpaced my interest in the game. It might be an idea to agree on a cap for our card pool e.g. nothing past the end of the 2nd cycle.

Just excellent game! And highly addictive. With good selection of cards from datapacks and Deluxes it keeps you entertained for a very, very long time with huge amount of different ways of play.

My absolute favourite card game. The only game that consistently gives me adrenaline rushes. It's always fun, intense and fresh.

It has a somewhat steep learning curve, and it being an LCG is a large barrier for new players to cross. I don't play it as much as I would like to.

While I'm no where near halfway decent at this game, it certainly occupies a fair amount of my mental energies when I'm away from it. Thinking of new ways to use cards and different deck ideas is incredibly fun. I love the LCG model and can't wait to see what's coming next.

Edit: My opinions on the LCG model have changed for the time being and collecting cards to construct decks isn't as appealing to me as pulling out a box with everything I need inside. So for now, dropped from a 9 to a 7.

I never played the original Netrunner and I initially ignored this upon it's release despite a large following in my local group.  Curiosity got the best of me and I asked to play one game just to see what it was all about.  Now here I am over 50 play later and I can't get enough.  I enjoy the LCG delivery system for the game much more than when I used to play MtG and I feel as though you get A LOT of game for your money with this one.

Ok, so after playing in a couple tournaments for this game so far I have come to the conclusion that this is a great and really fun game that has a horrible tournament structure.  The amount of luck in this game really makes it difficult to come up with a fair way of playing a tournament structure that doesn't take up a prohibitively large amount of time to play.  As the corp you can get horribly unlucky with your draw and mulligan being full of agendas.  As the runner you can luck in to a ton of points early and just coast.  Winning the first game is a huge advantage going in to the second game if it goes to time.  I'm not sold on the tournament structure overall, but this is still a great game for casual and league play.

After A: NR did so well in Geek Madness a couple of years ago I decided to give it a try. There are a couple of really nice things about the game. First of all the extremely asymmetric game play makes it so that the corp player and the runner play by their own set of rules. Second is the way the corp uses hidden information to try to control the runner, while the runner tries to predict what the corp is doing. These two elements not only create a compelling dynamic with regard to player interaction but are the foundation for the themes the game is exploring.

Unfortunately it's an LCG. This undermines player interaction by putting too much focus on analyzing a constantly evolving card set. And what you get in the starter set just isn't good enough when compared to similar games. The fact that the game is built around being endlessly expandable means the base set comes with a whole lot of extra rules baggage you only need if you are going to do a lot of deck building.

If you want a two player pseudo CCG without having to play the "meta" game get FFG's brilliant [thing=147154]Blue Moon Legends[/thing]. While asymmetric, it doesn't have the extreme asymmetry of A: NR. But it does have all the mind games and player interaction, without the rules overhead.

The new edition by FFG is an improvement on the original because it is no longer a CCG.  The asymetric game design is fantastic.  This game has a ton of depth, replay, and one of the coolest themes ever.

I think this has eeked its way to becoming my favorite game of all time.  I just cannot get enough!  EVERY game is interesting and tense, both for runner and corp.

Loads of text on each card; loads of icons too. If you look up the meaning of the icons, you find they represent many forms of hacking-related jargon; so you're still none the wiser. This game will never tell you to "Use this card to remove a green card from in front of another player", or anything so literal. It is so steeped in theme. There is probably a good strategic card game here, but my brain doesn't work this way.

RATING: 8
The theme is extremely strong (so much so that the lingo is difficult to navigate at first), the gameplay is surprisingly fast, the options are deep, and the artwork is evocative of the setting. Not exactly a pick-up-and-play card game, Netrunner is a strategic battle between two players with asymmetric abilities and decks. 

One player is the runner, hacking into servers to sabotage corporate agendas. They are doing everything it takes to create a high-functioning rig that will enable them to crack through any firewalls and survive long enough to have taken down a sketchy and uber-powerful company.

The other player is the wealthy corporation, specializing in gaining assets, launching programs, and establishing agendas. The corporation knows that there are hackers looking to take them down, so they must attempt to set up several servers in order to create revenue and progress in their tech. They can even set up traps and strong firewalls for unsuspecting runners. 

The beauty of Netrunner is in its smooth card play and convincing lore. The feel is so grandiose and ingrained in the functions of the game that nothing feels shoehorned, but only natural considering the theme.

RATING: 5
Android Netrunner has quite an interesting theme and all the jargon used in the game adds to the atmosphere (although I have to say that it makes learning the game a lot harder). Fog of war is also nicely executed with the corporation player playing his defenses face down. Figuring out the best combos from your cards is fun as well.

After a few plays the bad stuff kicks in, though. It is extremely boring to play the corporation. You are basically just sitting there waiting for the runner player to attack or waiting for the scoring cards to appear. I guess it says enough if you use the word "wait" twice in a sentence. Moreover, the rulebook is as bad as you can expect from Fantasy Flight Games. It is absolutely useless if you are trying to find some important rules. All rules having a big impact on the game play (the maximum Memory Units the Runner has at his disposal, for example) should be at least bolded or made stand out from the rest of the text. But no. Now everything is scattered all over the rulebook and some rules cannot be even found under the title explicitly referring to them making it impossible to find the piece of information you need quickly. 

I definitely cannot understand how this is so popular of a game. Yes, I can see that there a good qualities to it but to me it felt unexciting and shallow. Oh, I know that some (or most) people don't agree with the shallow part, but if it takes tens of plays to see the depth, I won't be doing it. The few plays I have under my belt were enough to convince me against of buying this game.

RATING: 6.5
+Good depth of play without having an overwhelming number of choices.
+Plays quick.
+Numerous strategies in the base game alone seem to all be viable.
+Well done rulebook.

=I don't usually go for games with bluffing, but it works very well in this game.
=Game has a certain degree of luck, which can balance out a disparity in player skill. The better player will still win more often than not, however.

-Core set doesn't come with 3 copies of every card.
-Click trackers have no spot for 0 clicks spent (very minor gripe).

Probably the best CCG/LCG to come out in a long time. Finally got me excited about them again. While deck building is required, good play is what separates the good from the bad. So many things to do and not enough resources to do them all. Can't wait until the data packs come out to really start deckbuilding.

So, I finally played a game of Netrunner after watching my friends play it during lunch at work for several weeks.  The watching for weeks ended up being pretty good for learning the game, since I was able to dive in and start playing with only a few questions (and some minor rules reading as I had been reading the rules on and off while they played for those previous weeks).

The game was fun.  I played a corporation, Haas-Bioroid, and I don't remember what hacker my opponent played.  We were only using the standard decks - no expansions and nothing fancy.  Due to some great luck, within the first two turns the hacker had already gained two agendas - worth 4 points.  But then I got enough ice on the table to block a good many of his moves.  

I scored an agenda for 3 points, and thwarted his efforts when he made a run on my hand - I was holding two cards, they were the same, and they were worthless - a great hand to frustrate him.  Any cards I drew I played, keeping those two at hand for wasting his moves.  He did make a successful run against a secondary server to gain another agenda, putting him at 6 points to my 3.  Unfortunately, we ran out of time and I conceded the game to him. 

For a card game where I built what amounted to a secure server farm, the game was surprisingly fun.  I did make a few stupid moves, but it was my first time playing, next time will be better (indeed, I handily won my next two games using this deck).  As for understanding the terms, I've played the RPG Shadowrun for years, and I've read Philip K. Dick, so there was nothing here that I hadn't encountered before.

The card art is nice.  The symbols on the cards are easy enough to read and identify.  I like the theme too.  But this is a game I would never own.  Chalk it up to playing Magic for years... I'm burned out on card games, even living card games where I don't have to constantly update to new cards.  But if someone brings this to the table, I won't turn it away.

Really good asymmetrical 2 player card game by Richard Garfield (designer of mtg) once you get through the steep learning curve. Thematically cool with hackers and big corporations fighting a cyber war. Art is really good too. I just don't get it to the table because I tend to play games with higher than two player counts so this great game has sat on my shelf gathering dust. I haven't kept up with the expansions and like other living card games, that can lead to less inclination for me to want to play anyway as I would want to buy the rest of the sets and learn the ins and outs.

I'd probably give this game higher if there were more people to play it with.  Great theme.  Although it's annoying at first speaking about R&D and Archives, it does add to the atmosphere of the game.  Good mechanics and the bluffing and risk calculation makes it a bit unique. It can get expensive if you want to play competitively, although never to the lengths of magic.

I never could get into Magic, and always felt confused/frustrated at the mechanics. Android: Netrunner scratches the itch that Magic could not, and I LOVE it.

Pros:
- Replayability: you can play as several different corporations or runners, each with styles of offense and defense. If one doesn't suit your personality, try another!
- Depth: Holy moses. The level of depth here is great! There are an infinite number of combinations you can get in your hand, and you're never sure what your opponent will do next. Runners can surprise you with enhanced runs you didn't expect. Corps can lay traps that entice runners to their doom. It is a game of feints, bluffs, and aggression, and it works phenomenally.
- Flair: This game is BEAUTIFUL. The artwork and construction are top-notch, and they really help sell you on the theme. You FEEL like a corp or runner in a sci-fi Shadowrun-type world, and it's a blast.
- LCG: You can buy the base set and be good to go. No Magic-style constant purchasing of new cards. What you get in the box is all you need to enjoy the game, as it should be.

Cons:
- Learning Curve: The key to enjoying this game is investing the time to understand it. Newbies will be wary and overwhelmed. Coax them through it step by step, and watch some YouTube videos illustrating how the game works. Once they see a few rounds, they'll get it. The rulebook is acceptable, but not fantastic. YouTube will fill in the gaps. Still, this is not Carcasonne or Love Letter. I've played A:NR many times, and I still find myself looking up rules.

I highly recommend it, if you can invest the time to get through the initial rule-shock.

Really like this one, and played constantly for about 6 months with a coworker. Runner vs corp asymmetry works very well. Moved states, and can't find a new opponent, so it'll probably be shelved for a while, as I don't really want to play online.

Very nice asymmetrical game. The base game comes with 7 different factions right out of the box, which each play very differently. Tense and close games are nearly granted every game. There is some minor luck factor involved e.g. by drawing cards from R&D and getting a 3 pts. agenda.

You will need more than one core sets. You will need many expansions for competitive play, to build better decks. Its snowballing out and the expansions are not balanced, meaning you cant win Competitions just with one Core Set and wthout expansions. Decks with expansions will be stronger for shure. (Jackson Howard, i am looking at you)

Otherwise a very solid game and what i like most about it is the asymmetrical setup. I like the deck building mechanic and most things other people love about the game too. But the expansion madness is a big minus.

Android Netrunner is a game that did the impossible in my mind. It made me say there was a card game that surpassed Magic the Gathering for me even when I was trying to keep Magic as my top card game. It's asymmetrical play is totally unique as of now for such games and the Poker element of bluff and bait is much more involved than any other card game, meaning looking at your opponent and his body tendencies are a element of play too.  
Downside is it is harder to learn than the other card games as to the asymmetrical factions and cost long run for a successful LCG game like Netrunner can become expensive to keep up with the competitive curve and buy all the new cards.

Becomes a bluffing game due to the hidden information on the corp side.  There are lots of choices to make and so many of them are important.  The runner needs to be bold, but so does the corporation.  Money is very tight and that ends up driving everything.  (And I mean EVERYTHING.)  I'm still wrapping my head around the deckbuilding aspect, but the LCG nature makes me happy-ish.  An excellent implementation of an old CCG.  Makes me wonder what I should do with my old Netrunner CCG cards.

FAVOURITE GAME - I have to say it is my favourite LCG. The game itself is set in a future digital universe, where hackers, called runners are trying to steal precious data from the Corporation's servers. The game rules are quite different for the two sides, which dillutes the sometimes monotonous gameflow of LCG-s. The artwork is one of the best I have seen. It is surely a must have game.

RATING: 8
Asymmetrical, smart, tense, funny, thematic... There are very few downsides to ANR, and most of them (like the ever-expanding card pool) are blessings in disguise.  Even just the core set has a ton of potential for deckbuilding, but chances are this game will sink its hooks into you and you will want to buy at least a few data packs.  If you don't have a partner in mind, look around your local area for a play group.

Highly recommended for any fan of L/CCGs, cyberpunk, 2-player card games, bluffing, or asymmetry. 

NOTE: I am now looking to sell off my entire ANR collection, current through Order & Chaos. Organized in two binders.

This game has it all: excellent theme, asymmetric play, outside of game deck building, evolving meta, manageable price point.

RATING: 8.5
What a fantastic piece of game. Very clever, relatively fast and easy to learn, despite of some complexity in some specific cases in the rules. An impressive assimetric play that both sides plays very different but anyway the game seems very balanced, of course changing the decks will unbalance the game, but choosing your deck wise is part of the strategy in LCG. The art here is amazing, the cards are all very beautiful.

I am attracted to the look and feel of this game. I loved NEUROMANCER and am drawn to both conceptions of 'living' in cyberspace and the tension between the goals of corporations and those of hackers. Although the FFG aesthetic is a bit cartoonish, it still carries enough of the tropes of cyberpunk for me to want to invest in the game. 

Unfortunately, the mechanics kill it for me. As a system, I think the underlying action-point structure nicely marries some of the aesthetics of the genre. It's balanced enough as you feel like you have options but aren't sure if you are being efficient enough until you know what your opponent is trying to do. Unfortunately, instead of making a complete game, you have to continually buy cards from FFG to keep up with the metagame. 

The overall dynamic means the game plays you. If you play this at the competitive level you must continually pay to play decks that give you a chance. If you play this casually you will eventually fall into rote strategies in known matchups. I don't see a meaningful difference between the meta-dynamics of this game and Collectable Card Games. Intellectually, you are chasing your tail, and financially, you are a sucker.  

I don't think you should buy this game. As someone who played A LOT of tournament [thing=463][/thing] and [thing=13293][/thing], the LCG model destroys games by making them cost several hundred dollars and an arms race played out as a series of 'take that' deck construction surprises. 

I'D RATHER WE PLAYED: [thing=43022][/thing]. You pay upfront for a complete game and can master a character over time. The relationship between bluffing and valuation is more fluid and personal to the players.

Vote for pure hatred of all things LCG / CCG. And because its top ten ranking is a ridiculous fanboy byproduct... I will never understand how this, Mage Knight, or Eclipse are top 10. The other seven games, I can see why people would rank them highly (and I only like half of them at best). And even Eclipse and Mage Knight, I can almost see it in that fuzzy magic-eye puzzle sort of way, if I turn my head upside-down and squint really hard. Are people just ranking it based on how much money game stores are making off of it?

выглядит довольно любопытно: первый раз встречаю подобную игру, которая не является вариацией на тему MtG (при этом автор игры - Ричард Гарфилд). при этом геймплей асимметричный и тематический. не сказал бы, что всё ясно и понятно, но попробовать можно. единственное, тут декбилдинг перед началом партии. 

правила написаны хорошо, разве что по какой-то загадочной причине ни слова не говорят, что происходит, когда у раннера заканчиваются карты. корпорация в данном случае проигрывает, а с раннером в аналогичной ситуации не происходит ничего (потому что его здоровье измеряется картами в руке). тем не менее, судя по гуглу и форумам, это один из самых распространённых вопросов по игре (хотя сама ситуация возникает редко).

Bought it for the art.  Never thought I'd like it so much that I'd buy every single pack that came out.  Even continued to buy the new packs when I moved to a city that didn't have a Netrunner scene (and I didn't have the time anymore to play).  Finding coworkers that got into it meant that this went back from "collecting game for art" to "getting all cards to play at lunch"

This is a really good 2-player game.  Set in a high tech cyber punk world one player takes the side of a global corporation and the other a hacker trying to take down the corporation.

The play is very different for each side and there is a number of factions making the game play really variable.

Lots of variety just from the core set.

I wanted to like, heck even love Android Netrunner. The core game is so completely unbalanced, there are entire websites dedicated to unscrewing it. The game's base core gameplay is probably fun if the corporation had any power whatsoever. 

I tried this game between two worlds-topping decks and the Runner wins every time due to horrific action economy and infinite ability to break ice with little trouble. Corps have no time to score hardly ever even if you try to force a window. Coming from someone who plays top level in MtG and other TCGs, this is ridiculous. I checked data someone compiled on over 44,000 games in the Netrunner scene and Runners win 10% more games than Corps even controlling for skill (pitted against each other at high skill, and pitted each high skill faction separately against the average pool. Exactly the same results each time). This is only mitigated by 5% if the Corp has 3x of a certain card in their deck. Which they must actually draw to get that 5% extra failure rate instead of 10%. 

This is completely unacceptable bullshit and no one should play it. On top of this, Netrunner plays like a by-the-numbers game with barely any depth (i.e. the most intricate game of solitaire ever). I love bluffing games so this turned me on to it immediately. However, there is zero bluffing in Netrunner. To bluff, it requires multiple actions on the part of the Corp. To run, it usually requires the same or LESS from the Runner. Meaning you can't run their resources out unless you get purely lucky with card draw.

Great for a LCG. Fantastic art, asymmetrical play (pro !), good factional theming, everything's great. Deckbuilding is moderately annoying. There are limited moneymaking cards, so one sees the same ones over and over. 

I do not like the DM versus player feel of the game. Runner is like a blind adventurer versus a gamemaster with an unknown power level. 

Many of our games were: runner saves up money for, probably, too long of a time. Makes a run. Picks the wrong server, gets pwned very hard, concedes. 

Me and some of my friends may just have the wrong personalities for this game. We've all played MtG, EPIC, Star Realms, the Star Wars TCG, and plenty of other card games.

After a few dozen attempts, I still have never won as a Corp, and when I switched with my brother, he couldn't win as a Corp either. I'm not sure if the base, starting decks are unbalanced in favor of the hacker, or if there's some ingredient that both of us are missing.

Clearly, it's an intriguing game though. I just wish I was better at it!

Update 8/7/2015: Score increased due to increased card variety. The anti-climatic commentary was addressed by cards in the first cycle.  

12/26/2013: Fun little game, but more often than not it plays a bit anti-climatically. The core design flaw is a lack of "instant" cards, so unexpected swings rarely happen (i.e. you can see a success or failure from a great distance, so a lot of the tension goes out of the game). 

Thematically, it's a 10. Rating is solely based on play with the core. 

...

My rating has gone up since I originally purchased the core, in part due to the additions from the first two cycles (at the time of this writing we're three card packs into the second cycle, with the second box set on the horizon). 

Even if the cards didn't open the door to a multiplicity of strategic options, the game gets a boost due to its speed of play. It really lends itself well to an organic sense of play development--sessions are fast enough that one can readily tweak between sessions.

My girlfriend and I have taken to tweaking often, and playing only to our personal meta. After making a major change, we play a few sessions with our new decks, then switch to see if the other can do better, if it seems to be a poor design, or worse.

Netrunner is a great game, though plagued by a few systemic issues - mostly that people hivemind really hard on the meta, and that it can have extremely high variance (though I'm not sure how it compares to Magic: the Gathering's variance which can be pretty nasty sometimes).  It's got solid mechanics, fantastic theme, and good gameplay that doesn't take too long - a winning combination right there.  On the other hand, I haven't had quite as much time for deckbuilding recently...

Just initially exploring this, and with just the premade decks, but it's a very fun, if somewhat complex, game of bluffing and gamesmanship.

There's certainly card draw luck, and there may not be quite so much bluffing on the Corp's side of things (advanced items will ... *frequently* ... be agendas), but it's very fun on both sides, whether trying to get the right ICE in place on the right servers, trying to plug all the leaks that come about, or as the Runner, getting a rig set up (see? I'm using game terminology!) with just the right breakers and cash to bust in on a server you think might have something.

The rules are terrible and make it really hard, I feel, to truly understand the flow and the various timing matters (when certain things can be rezzed or not).

Oh, wait, FFG.

Netrunner is quite a good game, but is very prone to imbalance at different player skills and card pools. I enjoy having a couple decks built,  but I don't feel the need to collect em all. I like to play super outside the box decks - weird decks that keep you off balance. As such, Replicating Perfection and Argus are a couple of my favorite corps.

I used to have this as an 8, just because it was tough to find people to play it with. This game is hateful towards new players. My first several plays of this game ended in what I'd call "Cheesy" ways. I straight up die to Neural Katana, my opponent loses because I draw agendas off the top, and so on...

Once you understand the card pool, and are able to more accurately assess the risks of certain actions like running unprepared, or leaving a server unprotected, these "Cheesy" wins can very nearly vanish... but for a new player they can make the game seem pointless.

That's what kept this from a 9 for so long. I put in the time to understand the card pool, so now I think I "get" the game. Your mileage may vary.

Small backstory about my history with card gaming.  Back in 1994, I started playing Magic: The Gathering.  I played that on and off until about 2002 or so.  It was fun, I played competitively for a while and had some high value cards/decks (Moxen, Lotus, etc).  Shortly after that, I picked up the Star Wars CCG from Decipher (which I collected feverishly and qu.  This game was far more complex, but way more fun. I liked that the two sides (Light side and Dark side) played differently and would go after different objectives.  Fast forward to now.  Netrunner comes out, offers a very asymmetric playstyle and completely eliminates the collectible aspect of card gaming (which was always a thorn in my side, especially the older I get... I just can't keep up with the card singles market).  I love the cyberpunk theme, it's fairly easy to teach, and it's (relatively) inexpensive to keep up with the game!  One of these days I may even start showing up at tournements!

This is the epitome of bad redesign. The old netrunner was better in many aspects and the current imbalance in favor of the runner IDs stems from FFG "improvements".

At first I was skeptical I didn't like the graphics compared to the old version. I was scared how different factions will influence the game. But after checking 2 different runners and 2 different corp decks, I'm really impressed. It is still same old Netrunner, that I was loving to play 15 years ago.

For minus:

- I still prefer the old art
- Cyberpunk 2020 theme is much more interesting then Android one

Pluses:

- Different factions for Runner and Corp
- Deck creation and influence
- Small tweaks making the game more fluent to play

For now it's 9/10, but it may increase. I'm still exploring only base set.

Update after 4 games

Score goes up to 9.33. 

I've played with, or against all factions. The game play is great, the factions are way different . I like this game more and more. Core set is enough for casual players, especially that all factions seems to be balanced.

Really enjoy this game: the asymmetric nature, the science fiction theme, the deception and deduction inherent that keeps every round, every click, every action exciting.

NetrunnerDB has some amazing decks that you can bring for a spin even if you aren't very into deck-building: and it's amazing to see how the deck really falls together to form this coherent strategy that you can bring to bear against your opponent and all their different decks.

I'll leave my prior review and comments below; however, ANR has taken a turn for the worst in the most recent cycle and the community and meta has become stagnant and toxic in the face of the MWL. That being said I would not reduce my rating except for this simple issue: ANR now gets to a point it feels either the corp or the runner hits a critical mass and cannot be stopped. Gone are the days you had to pick and choose when you put an agenda down or made a run making the game less of a risk and more of a surety once you hit a certain point.

I love this game. It plays uniquely to many card games like magic due to the asymmetrical roles of the corporation and runners. In addition it has a very strategic and almost Eurogame feel due to the reliance on economic power to fund or defend runs. The game has a thriving and helpful community as well that extends to card and board gamers. Also since its a living card game constant changes are created in the meta through new cards and IDs.

The biggest downside to the game is the initial buy in for new players since the game has been out for 3 years and releases quarterly data packs. This can be imposing and does keep some players from getting the game. That being said with 1 core set and maybe 2-3 datapacks ($60 total) you can and will have success in most local groups. This is at its core a game of skill and bluffs. The best cards and the best deck will get you nowhere without it and many unorthodox decks win tournaments when properly piloted.

Played 2X at Origins.

Starting my rating at a 6 and it likely will go up as I get to understand the nuances of the Corp/Runner better, along with getting into the card drafting mechanism.  

Update 7/3/2013:  Played 3 games as the runner and now starting to get a feel for the game. Moving up to a 7 (probably will be an 8 after I play a few more games).

This is my first real "deck building" outside of playing game, and it's been a real joy. The game ALWAYS feels tense. There's a ton of replayability here, new strategies to try, new corporations and runners to play. Yes, it was really hard to get over the learning curve, but now that that's done, fun can be had. 

My husband and I own two copies the core and all the expansions for this (only 1 copy of C&C), so that we can each have our own decks! This is probably the only game of this type we have the appetite for.

I was a fan of the original CCG Netrunner.  This game kept the core of the original, but added several balancing touches (non-blind traces being a big one).  I personally like the addition of the identities, and the cleanup of the card design (and the update to the art).  It's an asymmetrical, non-randomly collectible card game with elements of bluffing, risk taking, and just great gameplay.  Couldn't ask for more out of a game.

Great, great, great.  Took a base game I already loved and revitalized the market for it in a better-produced package.  Easily the most successful "FFG treatment" of a property that I've ever seen.  I have fun playing it, building it, reading and talking about it.  To that end, it's probably my favorite "solo" game too. Really took a dive in terms of meta management, various forms of defiance. Worst of all, probably, is the refusal to work a "living core" definition into rotations. Gotta drop from a 10 to a 9.

I never played the original Netrunner, and then played this with a friend who was much more excited to try it than I was.  I actually hated my first game - a lot of unintuitive mechanics and jargon, and a overall feeling of helplessness from some terrible rules explanation.

Then, I was reading the rules afterward: "What, you mean scoring agendas doesn't clear the server of all cards, including ICE? And I can install ICE on an empty server?"  (Like I said, really bad rules explanation)

Then actually went out and bought it, having hated my first game.  Love it, it really is a great game once you play it right.  Still got a pretty high learning barrier, but overcoming that, you'll find an asymmetric card game that is highly strategic and shockingly well balanced.  Playable out of the box with only one set with workable prebuilt decks and sensible card distribution (though I want more Corporate Troubleshooters...), which is better than diving in to deck building right away.

Memories of playing the original came back from over 15 years ago. Amazing. Going to try and get this to the table with the wife.

After a few plays loving it. A lot of tactics and strategy.  Deck building is hard to try and find the right combination that works.

Rating lowered to a 8 because apparently no one can make unique decks. Tired of seen the web clones. In my last 8 games everyone was playing Andromeda. WTF.

Lost interest after hyper competitive environment.

1/28/17 - I'm finally getting some repeated play in, and this game is a lot of fun.  I'm playing with someone who is going up the learning curve the at the same time and it's a much more enjoyable experience than learning against someone who has a few hundred plays more experience than you do.

1/24/13 - I do like the asymmetrical aspect, and I do like the theme.  Right now I just know enough to be dangerous, mostly too myself.

Rating may go up with more plays.  There's certainly a lot here, but two player card games may not be my thing.  We will see.

Cards are thin.  Sleeving them is the first thing that I did to the game.

So much good stuff.  Love the freedom provided by the click system.  Love the ability to "make runs" on the opponent's hand, deck, and discard pile--simultaneously fishing for points while also gaining information.  Love the seamless integration of theme with gameplay. Love deckbuilding!  Brings me back to my MtG days (for a fraction of the price.)

While I do enjoy the mindgames involved with ICE/agendas, I'm a bit fearful that they will feel too random after multiple plays ("oops I lost a coinflip, I guess I lost the game.")  I need more plays under my belt to see if this is an actual problem.

Not looking to get into competitive play, due to the price factor.  A bit disappointed to see how overpowered some of the expansion cards are.  Still, I think the core set can provide a lot of entertainment with friendly play.

A great concept and a theme i would've loved to have followed more. But the complexity, 2-player only and long play time makes this game difficult to get to the table, and even more difficult play consistently!

Great asymmetrical game. A little too many tokens and bafmodads for my taste but the core game play is pretty damn fantastic. Suffers from cards being unplayable via restrictive card costs just like MTG. So many cards that would have great implications for a game but can't be used in any form of competitive deck. Oh wells, nothing is perfect but still one of the best card based games out there.

Marking this down to an 8 because while I think it is a great game, it never hits the table. You have to have players invested in this game to find it enjoyable. The pre-cons are just not strong enough.

The art and atmosphere are fantastic - although like many lcgs, there is a lot of memorization that needs to happen first before you can start enjoying it.  Just as things start to get stale, you realise you can build your own decks, and then the real time sink begins.

Cyberpunk. This is the game that does it best, and seeing as cyberpunk is *the* best, well, what does that say about this game?

Cyberpunk has always been about asymmetry, about flexibility and inventiveness versus sheer resources and power. While that can sometimes turn on its head in this game, the core mechanics emphasize the material imbalance between the sides quite splendidly.

I am certainly going to subscribe to this LCG.

Incredibly good card game. Would expect nothing less from Richard Garfield... but frankly I wasn't prepared for how stressful each game of this would be.

The art on the cards is nothing short of amazing. 

As a corp, figuring out ways to bait the runner into heading for honeypot remote servers is nothing short of the fun of being a cylon in BSG.

As a runner, striking the balance between caution and speed is a great acrobatic act.

Ugh, I doooon't want to buy another card game. Someone stop me.

What an amazing game! Get over the initially WTF lexicon (which actually makes it even more thematic) and a true gaming joy is unlocked. The theming is omnipresent, engrossing and bound inextricably to the mechanics, the asymmetrical player experience is so refreshing and intriguing, the artwork is amazing, the cards/combos are interesting and extremely varied, the deck building is brilliant and there are very different strategies to victory. MTG is a truly great game (once you have got a decent card pool..) but I ditched all my cards once I discovered Android:Netrunner. I can't recommend this enough.

Vajon mit tudhat ez a játék, útban a dobogó felé? Nagy várakozással ültem le, és nem csalódtam! A téma és a felépítés is nagyon egyedi, teljesen mást tud a két oldal. A cégnek szoftvereket kell telepíteni és bevédeni, a hackernek meg fell kell törni a cég dolgait. Nem látom még át a játékot, de tömérdek taktikai lehetőség látszik első pillantásra is, és már most is látom, mennyire izgalmas tud lenni: vajon győzelmi pontot szerzek, vagy tűzfalba futok? Főleg a cégnek hatalmas szabadsága van, rengeteg féle stratégia kínálkozik. A hacker szerepe talán egy kicsit egyértelműbb. A nyelvfüggőség nem vészes, a kártyákon elég sok szöveg csak körítés, a lényeg gyakran csak 1-2 szó. A szabály fél óra alatt elmondható, és egy parti is lemegy kb. ugyanennyi idő alatt. Egyetlen bajom a játékkal, hogy havonta kijön hozzá egy kieg, ebben valószínűleg nem kívánok elmerülni, az alapban is van több cégpakli és több hackerpakli, de az biztos, hogy a kiegekkel szinte végtelen lesz a variálhatóság. A játék amúgy is elég drága a tartalomhoz képest.
---
Engem idegesít a játékban az, amikor egy sima kártyahúzáson dől el 3 pont. Ha kihúzza a kezemből, esetleg meg is nyerte az egészet, ha nem húzza ki, én nyerek... Ha a húzópaklimból húzza ki, az még röhejesebb. Oké tudom, be kell védeni magam, de ez nem mindig olyan egyszerű:) És azt is elismerem, hogy egy ilyen rövid játéknál ennyi belefér.
---
A sok hibája ellenére is kezd beszippantani... Érik, hogy az első 6 kieget megveszem. Zseniális ez a játék, de még 100 parti után is amatőr mazsola leszek szerintem:(

LCGs are not board games, they're a racketeering scheme.  For that it deserves a '1' rating.  

Any 'game' that allows you to BUY your way to an advantage over your opponent is cheating, pure and simple.  Imagine playing chess where your opponent gets to buy an extra knight or bishop at the start of the game. Or a boxing match where one guy gets to be 20 pounds heavier and wear brass knuckles under his gloves.  That's what LCGs do.

That said, the idea is a good one (hence the 5 rating).  They just need to make it a static 'game' where each player 'builds' their deck at the start of the game, with the components inside THAT game box.  Do this and the game warrants an 7.5 or 8 rating.

Fantastic asymmetrical gameplay. Interesting theme. I love the ability to splash in other faction's cards. In fact, the factions make this game very interesting. It allows you to radically change your style of play which adds tons of possibilities.

RATING: 8.75
This asymmetrical MtG-like 2-player cyberpunk, system hacking card game is pure gold. The card art are absolutely stunning and wonderfully thematic, whilst the game play is tense, strategic and also completely customisable. One of the very best 2-player card games around.

RATING: 5
Very nice game, I like games with assymetrical powers. The theme is nice too and is quite tangible, you really feel like netrunner/corporation when playing.
edit: after little more than a dozen of plays in a short time I think I'm sated for some time. Plays last a bit too long for my liking, I rather like the quicker pace and more dynamic action of MtG to this.
edit2: two more plays after a long break and it looks that my desire to play this game weakens and weakens.

RATING: 8
I didn't play the original Netrunner, but of course felt the desire to discover what made that game so great and hyped.
This remake is pretty close to the original, they say, with only some deckbuilding rules (stolen from Reiner Knizia's Blue Moon) added to remove the problems the old versiod had (I heard).

The game is quite intriguing, balanced even if very asymmetrical, and I can see it originating a very good tournament scene.

The design is clever, while not very innovative (it's almost 20-years old, after all...): it's a game of action efficency, where the players can unmake what the opponent has done, and the most efficient chain of plays will win.
The mechanic represents in a fine manner some sort of Gibsonesque cyberpunk world (a futuristic world as seen by an 80s writer, quite vintage), while the artwork and card layout wonderfully convey the mind towards the exact same imaginary.

After a few dozen plays, I can surely say this is my favorite customizable card game ever. A masterpiece.
I currently find myself continuously thinking about deck tweaking and strategies. Can't play it enough...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Card distribution inside Fantasy Flight LCGs core sets is starting to piss me off, but Netrunner is so good I had to buy a second set for deck building purposes.
Is it really necessary? For casual play one set may be enough, but if you play a card game without building decks, why do you play? With these games, half the fun comes before actually playing!

RATING: 8
Initial Impression: For a card game, this is wonderfully asymmetrical. It has a great Shadowrun-esque cyberpunk theme where the console cowboy is running a Corp's systems in order to steal valuable data. The players' decks are customizable and I suspect half the fun is coming up with the "optimal" deck for your playstyle.

10 Plays: This game definitely has the "one more game" appeal, as the duel between corp and hacker can be short. Knowing the capabilities of your deck are essential, as is knowing the preferences of your opponent's deck. There's definitely depth to this game that I haven't even begun to explore.

20 Plays: I'm beginning to experiment with constructing my own decks. I'm finding deck tweaking a challenge as I don't have regular opponents. Still, it's interesting to see the ramifications of the tweaks. I've taken to playing a solitaire variant in order to test my decks. I've observed that datapacks are not a necessity for casual play. That's a good thing.

It is my first LCG card game. I have been waiting for it for a long time and I'm glad that finally I'm not disappointed. The game is excellent! The more I play, the better it seems.

Android Netrunner...

I got home, unboxed the game, played it once solo, to learn the game, played it twice, played it 3 times, played it then some more. Now, let see what my wife will tell about it.

Edit: I have played Nettrunner 11 times with my wife(1 core set only). She loves it. Offcourse she does. The game is bluffing on steroids for corporation, and bluff calling on steroids for runner. I bump the rating from 8.5 to 9, only because I haven't played it with all factions, and I feel the game is a little umbalanced with what we played (Shaper vs Jinteki). So much fun with only a core set.
Edit 2: Bad-ass game. 9.5 rating.

The asymmetrical mechanics of this game are very well thought out. The out-of-the-box depth and subtlety of the game play make Android: Netrunner one that you want to play over and over. There's always something to figure out, always a strategy to develop. The components are of the highest quality. The artwork, while much of it is recycled from other Fantasy Flight Games titles in the Android universe, is high quality and genre-appropriate. That goes a long way in selling the universe in which the action of this game takes place. FFG does a great job of supporting the game through rules updates and clarifications where appropriate. A:NR is a living card game (LCG), and as such, FFG has the opportunity to further expand on the base concepts presented here. They have done so with the first seven expansions (Data Packs), and I expect that they will continue to do so with future expansions.

RATING: 6
Ok as a game, but the barrier to entry for new players is excessively high from both a gameplay and cash perspective. The fact you need three core sets to even be remotely competitive with a seasoned player is ludicrous. The LCG model is fine but there needs to be considerable design changes from makers of these games so that new players feel welcome and engaged. Look at Smash Up - you can compete with any player using any expansion just with the core set. Netrunner, by way of contrast asks for £90 on three copies of the same box just for single copies of San San grid. Nope. Sold it and won't go back.

I played some [thing=463]Magic[/thing] in the past and was not sure if a game with just 2 factions (although multiple "characters" per faction) can offer a similar variety. Especially since [thing=463]MtG[/thing] adds new abilities to the game each year (season?).

But man, I'm really impressed with this game! Your play-style not only changes depending on the hacker (runner) you play, but also depending on the MegaCorp you're running against.

Additionally I really like the theme of hackers and technics and stuff - a theme that we rarely see in board games.

Being a software engineer myself, the flavour text is the icing on the cake. It made me chuckle on various occasions (and my wife was immediately terrified as the hacker :D)

UPDATE - [2.26.17] Top tier game.  Deep and engaging deck building.  Asymmetrical game of hide and seek between the Mega Corps. and the plucky Runners.  My favorite 1 v 1 deck building LCG.

- Core Set
- Creation & Control
- Honor & Profit

- Flashpoint Cycle 2 of 6 Data Packs (23s, BM) 

LIKES - Android universe.  Awesome asymmetry.  Challenging deck building.  Variety in factions for both the Runner and Corp. sides.  Bluffing.  Dripping in theme.  

DISLIKES - Non-gamers, non-deck builders may have a difficult game grasping rules and strategies.  

WHY A 9.5 RATING BASED ON BGG RATING DEFS? - This is an "outstanding" game.  Will I "always" want to play it - time will tell.  That is why I can't give it a 10.  I love deck building games.

The jargon is annoying but not a deal breaker as it doesnt take that long to know what everything is and the card pool is not that large in the core set so you will quickly learn what it all means.  Lots of positives, decent amount of theme, deck construction options, good amount of cards and factions in the core set, different from other dueling, faction based card games, bluffing, tension etc.....but at the end of the day there is a lot of luck e.g. run on A rather than B, oh your were successful... run on the deck...oh you got an agenda.  Doesnt grab me in the way lots of other 2 player games do but going to give it a few more tries

Really not my kind of game...
I was eventually ready to invest some time in deckbuilding, but i had very little fun with the 12 or so first games with the discovery preset decks from the core set.  The games feels quite dry, with very calculatory runs, and of course too much luck dependant for what it is (last game my opponent (first and last game for him) as a Corp drawed 5 projects out of 8 cards at the start of the game... clearly nothing to do, without adequate ICE, he was stuck). Will trade the game...

Netrunner is a tremendously interesting asymmetrical card game. The corporation and the runner both have constant meaningful choices to make, and the rules they play by are almost completely different.

I love this game. It's the most exciting and tense game I've played. The asymmetry of the game means gameplay is very different depending on what character you choose. 

The downfall is, it takes ages to get your head around the rules and unique vernacular of the game. It took me a month to figure out how to play the game originally. Then, it's really hard to find someone else who wants to learn the rules as well. I rarely play this anymore for that reason.

This game has been supplanted by Letters from Whitechapel as the "go-to" game to be played with the wife.  She says she enjoys Android, but is relatively unsure how to play some of the cards, and does not like to take a lot of time to research.  She also does not like the deck-building mechanic.

If you're prepared to forgive a cyberpunk theme that has aged poorly alongside the rise of the real Internet, there's a fascinating two-player game waiting for you here.  One player takes the role of the corporation, the other the role of a determined hacker, and though each has very different goals and methods of achieving them, the game is quite well balanced.

Regardless of which side you're on, risk management is the key to victory.  Move too conservatively and you'll get pwned by a player willing to take some chances.  Be too aggressive and you'll get clocked by a player who can sucker you into wasting resources on fights you can't (or don't want to!) win.

It's not perfect.  The mechanic of drawing from a single undifferentiated deck can make things awfully swingy; an unlucky corp player who doesn't pull enough good defensive programs really can't do much, and a few lucky fishing expeditions by the hacker can win the game.  And the deck-building aspect is too limited to be satisfying (at least out of the box -- I'm hoping expansions will correct that).  Even so, this one's a keeper, well worth checking out.

There is not much I don't like about this game. I love the theme, I love the asymmetrical play, I love the bluffing and the artwork is great too. The android universe has been close to my heart ever since I played the boardgame. Reprinting and setting Netrunner, a game I've been eager to get into for ages, in this universe is like a dream coming true.

The added factions also help the game by limiting deckbuilding and thereby keeping overpowered combos to a minimum. Everything comes at a price when building your deck. Also the actual playing of the game is more important than the deckbuilding. This really is a game of skill. Unlike other games a bad player with a good deck will have a hard time against a good player with a bad deck. This is mostly because you play your opponent and not your deck. Bluffing, risk management and resource management are very prominent. And games are never dull because the game rewards risks. Playing passively will almost always mean you lose.

The core set is enough to get you started and will give you a ton of replayability. The expansions are great to add more variation and deckbuilding options. The only thing I'm not crazy about is the LCG format. I'd much rather have a big expansion once a year or something like that. But the game is so good I'm willing to let this one go.

This game feels finely tuned. Every decision is important.  The asymmetric nature forces each player to have unique strategies rather than trying to have the optimum strategy.  This game implements the secret unit deployment mechanic in a unique yet elegant way which coupled with the tension of limited resources intensifies the importance of each action.

Probably the best card game ever designed and while the LCG model has its problems, they have yet to screw it up, even if I personally would like them to slow down the release schedule.

Overall, this is my favourite game of alltime and a game that I deeply regret not being able to play more often.

You can play it out of the box as it is and have loads of fun, but it becomes truly awesome when you start to build your own decks.

As of 2016, this has dropped to my #2 game due to it not being played enough and me falling behind with the much too hectic release schedule. A shame.

My god. Only a couple of plays and I am in LOVE with this one. The only concern is the high amount of on-board complexity can be a turn-off to many players. I eat it right up, though. MOAR PLZ.

Dec 2012: The game remains my most-played. Compact, quick enough, and a whole host of strategy that will have both players biting their nails at every stretch. This game is brilliant. Buy it. Make it a household name. Send it to the top. It is that good and better.

Six plays through with my brother and we feel like we're getting the hang of everything now.  I'm still feeling like, at this point, the order in which I draw cards has a lot more to do with the outcome than my decisions.  We both expect that to change as we start building decks (which we haven't done yet) and get a better feel for the strengths and weaknesses of everything.  I've rated this a 7.5 so far, but I expect that to go up as we get into deck-building and more plays of the game.

I've already bumped this to an 8.  The more we play, the better it gets.  We can already feel ourselves getting pulled in a bit and ready for expansions to spice things up.  This easily has the potential to go a bit higher, but we'll see how it goes.

I've since pushed this back down to a 7 because I can't see getting into this too much.  It's really good stuff and a game I won't embrace as much as so many have.

Outstanding. Always want to play.

You can't really judge just how good this game is until you have had repeated plays and started getting into constructing your own decks.

Putting together a runner and a corp deck, working out the synergies between cards, agonising over what to leave out. Then meeting up with your mate and going head-to-head not knowing what they are going to throw at you. Bluffs, deception, suspicion, nasty surprises, twists and turns, and heaps of tension.

You don't need to have a massive pool of cards. The 1.1.1.1 format is great way to play.

Wonderful game. Extremely tense with beautifully designed game mechanics. The balancing of this game is out of this world. Some cards feel so overpowered, until you realize that there is an easy counter against them. 

The game takes 20-90 minutes to play, which is perfect for quick gaming sessions. Finished in 30 minutes? Let's play again! 

Not only is this one of the best games I know in terms of game mechanics, it is also extremely thematic. When playing a game of Netrunner I am feeling like a corporation that tries to protect its agendas with everything they have to offer, while my opponent tries to hack into my systems, exploiting every little mistake I make. 

Last but not least, the artwork in this game is astounding. I would hang each of these images on my wall if they were poster sized. 

Highly recommended.

Whenever a game is dripping with theme - that is, whenever its rules fit with the theme and make so much sense their thematic inspiration or explanation can be easily found - it arouses my interest, no matter how it actually plays: but if it even happens to have good mechanics too, then I know it’s bound to rock.

Android Netrunner is such a game: it combines a solid theme (actually one I’m not really interested in: cyberpunk has never been my cup of tea but still) with thematically befitting cards and rules insomuch that playing it really feels like trying to hack (or prevent that attack) a corporate server in a cyberpunk setting.

Certainly not the stuff my dreams are made of, nonetheless a challenge the game develops with thematic richness and some allure too: way to go for a collectable/livng card game!

There's not much I can say about Netrunner that hasn't already been said. I got into the original Netrunner when it was still being published, and although it was arguably broken (e.g. the Kati Jones of the time didn't have a "once per turn" limit), it still was a fascinating and at the time completely unique game.

What FFG has managed to do with it since the reboot has been extraordinary, particularly with the introduction of factions to develop unique playstyles and help balance the game. They also managed to give some much needed love to their Android universe, which I hope continues to be developed.

This game just didn't jive with us and I moved my copy along. I an see the appeal if you are into this type of head-to-head deck building duel game (ala Magic), but it didn't hold our interest enough. I think at this point we would rather put our time into FFG's other LCG, Lord of the Rings.

Very high replayability, even when playing only with the base game. Can be played casually, without deck building, and brings lot of fun. Great cyberpunk universe and ambient during the game.

Gave this a shot with a friend over the weekend. Overall, interesting, but not really the sort of game I like to play. The theme falls away pretty quickly while playing this and you just want to know what a card does. I think the game information could be displayed with a little more attention to intuitive understanding and a bit less cyber-jargon. I'm sure if I owned a copy and read the rules, I'd be a bit more charitable on these points. It seems that until you can get into the rhythm of play for your particular side, you can be at the mercy of the cards for the first two or three turns. I like that the base game comes with four corporations and three hackers to compete against one another.

Update: Have played a few more times and I really don't care for it. As a game, my problems are what I've already stated and I'll add a strictly personal one: I really can't get into the theme. Oh, I understand it's hackers and business networks playing a deadly game of cat-and-mouse with one another, but there's no one to root for, hiss at, or identify with. It's one of the few really thematic games I've played where the "story" leaves me asking, "So what?"

Very enjoyable 2-player deck builder, has quite a lot of depth.

Downside is that it's expensive and time consuming to keep up to date, ultimately it was these 2 reasons that made me sell my collection that I had purchased for $550 AUD and sold for about the same.

Corporation vs Hacker in dystopian theme. Theme implemented perfectly in cards. A lot of terminology that makes the game seem more complex than it is. Only as complex as you make your deck. 
THE BEST competitive card game. Asymmetrical: Runner has limited knowledge and corporation can bluff and punish. Wtf moments everywhere, opponent will hate you. Limitless potential for different playstyles.

I think I am going to stop purchasing further expansions after the Flashpoint cycle.  May need to get Fear the Masses from Mumbad cycle and Quorum from the Flashpoint cycle to make my collection complete.  Will be playing mostly on Jinteki.net with the cards from the subsequent cycle namely Red Sand.

Want to allocate more money to get Terminal Directives and subsequent expansion.

01/02/17
Okay there are so many IDs to play. I think it'll be good to write down what I would actually enjoy playing and would most likely want to play on this information page.

RUNNER MINI-FACTION: I thoroughly enjoy playing the Apex Spyware using Spy Camera, Reaver, Chop Bot, and Wasteland to help Apex draw cards and earn income.  In addition, with the introduction of Black Orchestra and MK Ultra, Apex does not mind having these two ice-breakers installed face-down and then uses them as fodder for Chop Bot to draw a card or remove a tag or to have Heartbeat using them to cancel damage.  I have to be careful with Ark Lockdown though.  However, I don't think the Corp will play this card just to remove a single breaker.

There are potential to make variations in this deck such as replacing R&D Interface with The Turning Wheel and Rumour Mill with Employee Strike.  Also, there can be so much that this deck can do once its card draw and income generation engine is set up.

ADAM RUN SOMETIMES - My next choice will be Adam Run Sometimes.  With Finding the Truth as one of the directive, Adam can start off without the severe limitation of having his hand reduced by two from Safety First as this will make him quite vulnerable to the many 'kill' deck around.

SUNNY - Unfortunately is too slow for me and will most probably defeated by prison deck.

CRIMINAL FACTION
ANDROMEDA - Two decks I most likely like to play is Andromeda Takeshi's Castle.  However, I am not sure whether I am comfortable with the deck build that does not incorporate Inside Job and Same Old Thing.  It seems to me that this deck is build mostly to counter NBN's traces.

Though the other option of playing Andromeda is playing a Stealth Andro deck using The Supplier but this will goes contrary to the Criminal playstyle which should be more aggro rather than taking time to build.

GEIST - Siege Engine Geist is a puzzle to me and I am not sure how he stands up against the current meta especially when going against Jinteki prison deck like Potato, Meatball and Alcatraz where these decks play very little else.  Most often this deck will have 1 Same Old Thing and 1 Levy.  So if these two cards are 'sniped', then it would most often be GG for Geist.  Maybe I should I put 2 Same Old Thing instead of 1.

Nevertheless, I think this deck will still be enjoyable with a gradual build-up and occasional offensive playstyle.

LEELA - I think I would reserve in playing Leela deck on jinteki.net where I prefer the Breakerless Job-Cross-Hook-Apocalypse deck.  It is often fun to play this deck as most players did not expect that it has no ice breakers.

For other Leela build, I may have to most likely experiment them first to see whether I like it.

So I think the three ID for criminal I would be focusing on playing will be Andromeda, Geist, and Leela.  Ian, Ken, Fisk, and Silhoutte seems "meh" to me.  But I think Ian can still be fun but I would have to take time to see what build I like to play or how to construct a deck with his ID.

ANARCH FACTION

SHAPER FACTION
ELLE "SMOKE" SCOVAK - A more straightforward deck that use Stealth programme.  I will build one before Quorum and another after Quorum where the latter I will include Sifr and Aaron Maroon.

HAYLEY PITCHFORK

EXILE AND THE PROFESSOR - I probably don't get Exile and the Professor and even with latter having the deck called the Sorcerer Supreme, I feel some reluctance to play it physically.  It requires you to remember what programmes you have.  To play Professor competently, you need to be able to remember your programme suite well enough to know what are those programmes that you should tutor.

HAYLEY DRYPER DECK - For some reasons I am not a fan of this Shaper Deck you require to take time to set up.  However, I can see the potential of this deck when the Runner can drop a Rumour Mill and the make Keyhole Dig multiple time using Hyperdriver. Most likely I will play this on J.net instead on physical space.

WEYLAND
BLUE SUN - I often like to play Blue Sun and you have to think of the option of which Ice to take back into your hand and gain credits and when you should actually take it back.  With the availability of Consulting Visit,  for the total cost of 3, it becomes easier for Blue Sun to tutor for Oversight AI andplay it to rez an expensive Ice.

However, I must always remember that I cannot/would not be able to use Consulting Visit and Boom! together in  one single turn due to both cards require an additional click to play.  Nevertheless, I need to be aware that I can still play Midseason Replacement especially when the Runner is low on credit and I have Boom! in my hand especially now many Runners don't include Plascrete Carapace.

Nevertheless, the era of Blue Sun may come to an end with the availability of Sifr.  Also, with Aaron Maroon from the Quorum datapack, players will have to carefully calculate how many tags they can land/place on the Runner unless Aaron can be first trashed.

JINTEKI
POTENTIAL UNLEASHED - I like the Prison Potatoes and Meatball deck and seems there are several variants for such deck.  The keycards will often be Breaker Bay (which I have to share with the HB deck), Hostile Takeover, Hokusai Grid, Friends in High Places, Ark Lockdown, Shock!, Bio-Ethics Committee and Jacskson Howard.

There seems to be two kind of Prison deck.  One that use the Medical Health Clinic where Runner would often not trashed but PU does not mind the Runner have more cards in hand who use Medical Health Clinic as the objective is just to 'snipe' as many cards as possible from cards and trash the top card from the stacks to cripple the Runner.

The other variant of Prison Deck will be Alcatraz that use Replicating Perfection ID but with more option for ice consideration.  This should utilise Excalibur.

PALANA - Another ID I like to play is Jimmy John Fast Food that the Grail Ice and operate to build up fast and score quickly behind an or some Ice.  It requires Caprice and Batty but due to the threat of Rumor Mill, there is a need for this ID to include some current like Cerebral Static.

NOTE: I haven't had the the chance to play Jinteki PU physically.

NBN
MAKING NEWS - I want to play the Tracing the Doors deck.  However, without the current cards from Quorum I may have to adjust the build to include some other Agendas and Ice.  This deck is so 'bloody' annoying when pitted against non-trace competitive Runner ID as it often mess up your economy and making you poor from doing much things.

NEW ANGELES SOL - I like playing SoL but not sure how will it fare against the current meta especially when the new rule limit only the use of one Astroscript.

CONTROL THE MESSAGE - For some reasons, the decks using control the message fails to appeal to me.  Maybe I have yet to find the right ID.

SPARK - I will most likely like to play Spark Agency as the second NBN ID for casual play as the game is fun (but to some degree less annoying as compared to Making News Tracing the Door).  Will play this against newbies of who may be using core set decks.

HAAS-BIORIOD
HB: ENGINEERING THE FUTURE - I like to play Sandvich which primarily leverage on HB drip economy asset and Sandburg to increase the strengths of its Ice.  This deck will use NEXT Bronze, NEXT Silver, and Architect.  It may use Vanilla.  NEXT Gold is not advisable to include due to the threat of Sifr. Supported by Friends In High Places, this deck can bring back Ice which has been trashed by Runners.  With the later introduction of Sifr, I may want to put 1 Lotus Field.  Also a Turing will be good a include to protect the remote server.

HB: ARCHITECTS OF TOMORROW - I want to play Architect of Tomorrow because it very unique and it leverages on the set of Ice that are of Bioroid subtypes.

SUMMARY - THE ID I WANT TO PLAY
CRIMINAL: Andromeda, Geist, Leela (on J.net)
SHAPER: Smoke Stealth Deck, Hayley Pitchfork
MINI FACTION: APEX, Adam, forget Sunny

HAAS-BIOROID: HB:Etf Sandvich (a.k.a Friendscoat), HB AoT - Fallingwater

That play was with someone that plays regularly and looks forward to cub stomping noobies.

Need to give it another shot.

Edit: I've played it again. Still not a fan. I can see why people like it, but it just doesn't work for me.

I only played this with my wife a few times. She's not that into it so I probably won't play it too much. My group doesn't go for 2 player games so I won't be getting the expansions. Otherwise I would as I enjoy playing it.

RATING: 6
While I appreciate the mechanics of this game, it feels a bit cat and mouse for me. One player (the cat/Corp) tries to trick the other player (the mouse/Runner) over and over again. Perhaps all decks don't feel this way, but I'm not overly interested in finding out.

RATING: 9.75
An entertaining LCG that rewards clever play and gives the player a lot of options. Decent artwork and thematic play. A little hard to teach. Most games so far was very tense.

There are a few problems with A:NR:
 - Agenda distribution is highly random and may dictate how a game plays out
 - Ice often dictates Corp play, so you're very draw dependent in general.
 - As the runner you will require certain tools for certain situations, which makes you very draw dependent as well.

You can make your deck more reliable, but the core game decks clearly lack a certain stability and only with a lot more cards you get a decent reliable outcome, that allows for clearly strategic play. With 2 Cores and some extra cards it's already very good!

RATING: 4.5
Really enjoyed the first game. Second game left me feeling very defeated (but I was playing an experienced player!); I was the runner against the corporation. I'm sure I'd love it with more plays but the time investment of deck-building doesn't appeal to me. Also - $$$ for the expansion decks. Not as bad as CCG, but still a little bit of a turn-off to me. Love the theme and the art!

Edit: Something I have learned about myself: competitive deck building in this sort of directly confrontational mode is not really for me. Maybe it's the fact that, despite it being an LCG, the "serious" players still dump $$$ on this (2 cores, 2 of this Data Pack, 5 of these others) to get duplicates of the "best cards" to put into their deck. And I don't usually feel like I can go up against that.

An amazing game. The mechanics are quite simple, but offer a good depth of strategy. Unlike some other card games, your chances of winning have less to do with 'drawing your power or combo cards", and more to do with how you play what you have. Since the Corp side plays their cards face down, the Runner has to guess / deduce where and when he needs to run. This opens the game up to a level of bluffing and mind games you don't see in many other games.

RATING: 8
El sistema es muy bueno, sólido, asimétrico y con una intensidad alta. Ambos jugadores están continuamente pensando en cuál será el siguiente movimiento del oponente.
PROBLEMA: Necesita las expansiones, así como tres copias de cada uno para tener las cartas buenas en el build.

A good asymmetrical constructed-deck card game. Very thematic, with interesting choices every turn. The sides play very differently: the Corp is about bluffing and misdirection, while the Runner is about finding tools and reading the Corp player.

Suffers from the usual problem of such games: it's hard to find opponents with the same level of commitment. If you are more serious, you don't see much challenge; if your opponent is more serious, you can get stomped without having much fun.

One of my favorit games, ive havent played it much lately, might be because of the constant expansions comeing evolveing the game. Might hafto change rateing as the more i think about it i might not enjoy the LCG as a type.

Update 7months later.

The LCG two player aspect is really killing it for me and deckbuilding and finding someone to play is killing it.

I see that its a great game but i dont want to play it i am probably gonna get rid of it.

Its still a great game that i find very fun but everything around it is...

ITS a great game but i must change my rating from a 9 to something that represent how much i want to play it and own it. Right now i feel its a 6 i will happily play it but just ... dont know

I'd been holding off on rating this until I got a decent number of plays of this version under my belt.  With Area 42 (Aug 24) and TCEP (LaborDay weekend) finished, I have now played every OOB faction at least once (and a few many more times than once) and can finally drop in a comment.

This is now my 'go-to' 2 player game.  OOB this title is phenomenal and every person I've showed it to has been interested in playing more.  The experience is spectacular with the provided starter decks and even with the same faction v faction matchups, they didn't always play the same based on the shuffle.

I'll have more of an opinion on constructed play once I've had a chance to do so.

07/24/2015: First play. The dense terminology and ruleset would normally be a turnoff, but about halfway through something started clicking and I could tell I would enjoy the game. Still don't really understand the rules and wouldn't be able to truly 'play' a game yet, but I definitely want to play again. 

I liked the truly asymmetrical aspect of the game, and the cards while a hodgepodge of types and abilities, seemed to fit well together due to the strong theme of the game. Dense but fun. Don't think I would enjoy too many expansions, there seems to be enough here even in just a base set... but I'm generally not an 'expansions' guy.

Update 09/04: bumped from 7.5 to 8 after getting 4 more plays in. Still very much in learning mode. 

Update 10/14: Up to 10 plays now. I love this game.

Update 10/17: Bumping to 8.5

Really amazingly evocative, though as with any card game with constructible decks, it's very, very easy to find yourself in a brutal, unwinnable matchup.

Fantastic card game!

Because you have your actions and credit pool to juggle, it feels like there's more control in Netrunner than there is in Magic (I am by no means an experienced Magic player). I actually found Netrunner much easier to learn because it operates more like a board game than a CCG.

Love the variety, the asymmetry, the theme, the art...I literally can't imagine a better 'collectible' game to get into.

I appreciate the asymmetrical gameplay and think this is a pretty well constructed game.  However, I just don't want to play it, or take the time to learn the rules, and I don't like LCGs for the same reason I don't like CCGs.  Good for some, not for me.

Simply fantastic game. I love the theme, the game mechanisms, the asymmetric gameplay, the artwork... Not sure how far I will go with this since it is a CCG, but so far I am having a blast. The possibility of playing it online (OCTGN) is the ice on the cake.
--------------------------------
(August 2014) I never put any thoughts into it, but given the amount of time I have spent playing Netrunner, building decks, listening to podcasts, watching videos and generally  reading about the game, Netrunner has no doubt become my favorite game, even if that means less time for playing other games.
--------------------------------
(March 2016) The year began with so much work that my plays decreased dramatically and eventually stopped altogether. After missing 3 or 4 datapacks, I lacked the force of will to get myself back up to date and stopped buying and playing the game altogether. My decision to quit the game was also helped by the personnel changes in the design team and my dislike for the direction the meta was heading to. I still keep all my cards and might play again, but competitive play is unlikely to be an option for me at this point.

This is the perfect drug to wean you off of MtG once you realize you've spent more money than you should have on it. It ticks the boxes for me for a great card/deckbuilder game, rich in theme, and more or less very well balanced. The fact that it's a living card game and not a collectible card game is what puts it over the top for me. At a rate of one data pack a month (at it's fastest expansion release) this is more than reasonable an upkeep cost if you've migrated from Magic. One of my favorite games ever.

Love this game, but it is hard to teach and it seems the only way to play it is to get into organized play, which I do not see myself doing.  If I had a way to play this in a casual setting on a regular basis, it would be in my top 5 games.

When I received some of the Jinteki cards were missing. Fortunately FFG sent me an entire other set of corporation cards which was pretty cool.

While I knew I had to wait, I picked up another corporation and tried to play it. The rulebook is rather difficult to get through, if you don't have someone who already knows how to play to teach you I wouldn't recommend picking this one up unless you are experienced in games of this nature and at sifting through rulebooks. My recommendation would be to watch the how to play videos online if you can't find a teacher.

Very rare to give such an easy 10/10.
The game's asymmetric nature coupled with well-themed pre-constructed decks helped in getting this established, as neither my GF nor me are experts on TCGs/LCGs.

At the same time, the expansion packs were cheap enough to coax us into buying while offering enough "temptation" to start looking into the customization process.

Finally found a game which works really well to be played between us two. And slowly evolving "my" deck adds a lot to it.

It's really surprising how well it balances, despite the sides being so different. And even the factions playing so different.

Asymmetry done right.  I'm still learning this, and I'll never be a top-flight player, but it generates a marvelous amount of tension for such a quick game.  The astonishing part is how different it feels to play corp than to play runner, yet knowing how to play one definitely helps to play the other.  Currently a 7, but could easily go up with more play.

I have the original Netrunner starter decks, but wasn't able to get them going.  This implementation is fantastic.  The asymmetry but balanced play and luck of the draw means each game is somewhat different than the last and sometimes they're wildly different than your last play.  Card art is extremely good.  Just a fantastic reimplementation by FFG.

RATING: 6.5
I'm still not sold on this, and I can't figure out why. I'm a huge fan of the Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings LCGs, and I thought this would be a no-brainer. Ranked among the top games of all time? It's gotta be good, right?

Well, it's only okay. I far prefer being the runner, because as the corp I feel you don't have a whole lot to do on your turn. Half the time as the corp I feel like I'm either placing ICE over nothing, or laying down stupid cards that don't help me, while the runner simply goes after anything I haven't protected yet (I should mention that I am not good at the game yet and have still only played this a handful of times using the core set). I just feel like too much relies on luck. We'll keep trying.

UPDATE: 10 plays in. I am starting to hate this game. We built our own decks, using the first expansion and chapter packs, fought it out over a half-hour, and the end came as suddenly and as unexpectedly as the first time we played. We might as well just be flipping a coin. What psychosis has possessed the boardgaming world that has deemed this anything other than the most mediocre of games? I just don't get it.

UPDATE: 20 plays in. I like it a lot more than I did, especially after playing the Android board game and reading some of the Mel Odom novels. Ironically, I now prefer playing the corp! The core scoring mechanism still feels arbitrary, and one lucky draw can abruptly and anticlimactically end an otherwise intense, long game (not to mention some games can last 2 turns where others can last 20). It's hard to shake the feeling that this is just an epic version of Go Fish! with lots of bells and whistles attached.

RATING: 8.5
This is my first game in the LCG format.  I really like it.

The hidden information in this game keeps both sides feeling super tense for the whole match.  The runner thinks the corp has some awesome flatlining ice, while the corp knows his dinky ice can't hold back the runner and doesn't know what to do with all the in-hand agendas.  The back-and-forth is super exciting.

That said, the hidden info can also make the game feel a little random.  If the runner happens to find two agendas in a row on the deck, or pulls the one agenda in your hand on his first try it gets frustrating.  Still, very fun.

RATING: 10
Outstanding.  Best LCG/CCG game on the market.  I know there are plenty of people that bash on this game but I see it as genious.  It combines five aspects together in great synergy.

Bluffing
Asymmetrical gameplay
Actions as resource
Deck contruction
Theme

Originally a MTG player, I switched to board and self contained games to reduce cost when I returned to the hobby.  LCG became an option when it came out and it has grown to include several games.  I have played LotR, GoT, W:I, and Netrunner.  Though all of these are decent, only Netrunner shines as an absolutely solid competitive game. Netrunner is not only the best of the LCG set, it is better than any CCG I have played.  It works and it works very well.  That isn't to say it's for everyone.  However, for what I have been looking for in a card game, this game exceeds my expectations and I hope to continue playing for many years.

Update (Oct 2014) Been nearly two years since I started playing this game and I still love it as much as I did when I wrote my original assessment.  This stands as the only game I play regularly in the midst of my collection.  For those getting into the hobby.  Start with a basic set, expand to one of the deluxe sets and then pick up 2 to 6 packs.  You can create a strong competitive deck for less than 100 dollars.  If you have no interest in playing competitively, just pick up the core.  The first cycle of six packs expands the core set for more variety without making any significant changes if you decide to expand.

I started playing A:NR in mid-2017, five years later after the release. The community is full of warm-hearted people that would really teach the newbies to master the game. Going to the mechanic, I really like how this game is done asymmetrically. One side would be the runner and the other would be the corp. The runner will steal and the corp will defend and advance their agendas. I got the theme and it chills me because I think we are actually in such age! Back to the game, this game is done in LCG after back then it was developed as TCG. The fact that it is converted is the only reason I decided to try. LCG means no more burning money for booster only to find that one copy of the rare card you need. LCG means everything is there, provided for you to play. You only need to be creative and intelligent enough to build a deck that can win you the way. Just like the other card games, FFG sometimes released cards that would tip the balance a bit off, but in the end, they will regulate it to keep the game expands and enjoyable.

Very well designed game.  I have no experience with the original Netrunner, so I'm looking at this pretty objectively from a Euro-gamers perspective.  Some of the terminology was annoying at first, but once you get past that it becomes quite thematic.  I don't think my wife will play this enough to warrant getting into the LCG money-trap, but I'll look forward to additional plays.

Deep game. We are working our way through the lingo. First play through was meh. The 2nd was weird bc the runner grabbed 3 agendas from R&D on the first turn but then card draw luck seemed to swing to the corp and that side actually won in a not very long match. We are committed to play a few times and at least see all the cards. Not sure if this will be a good match for us. The LCG aspect is cool and all but not sure how much I want to be throwing $ repeatedly at a single game...

RATING: 8
Although I wasn't a fan of the "classic" version of the game, that was back in the day that I was playing the Middle Earth CCG all the time, and in comparison to that game, Netrunner is pretty tame. The new edition I think has benefitted from the thematic graft to the Android universe, so it shares some backstory with Infiltration (a pretty good game). It's pretty generic, but much better than the lame Rex backstory, and it's enough to get your hands around.

I mentioned to a friend that Netrunner felt "retro", which he found confusing at the time. Having played it some more, that feeling has crystalized - Netrunner is, at the end of the day, just a game of "action attrition". Everything you do costs actions directly or indirectly (credits are just actions with a flexible exchange rate). It's a question of using your actions more effectively than your opponent. There just aren't a lot of tactics or synergies, only a touch of bluffing, no real card efficiency. Very little of the extra spice that gives games with a similar fundamental engine (like Jambo or Blue Moon) their gameplay bite. Just get the most bang out of your actions and hope you get cards in a good order. Maybe deck-building will flesh out the game space (it pains me to give FFG credit for simply not making a hash of the deck-building rules, but there you go: the deck-building rules, ripped off from Blue Moon, seem sensible).

The thematic material also feels a bit retro, with the tech feeling mostly 80's-era futurist vintage sprinkled with a few more modern ideas.

Regardless, there is enough here that if the William Gibson/Cyberpunk theme appeals to you, I think the game can draw you in. It definitely feels like the almost two-decades old design that it is, but that's not terrible.

Last thing, like all FFG games, a lot of really bad choices were made in the graphic design and the typically atrocious rulebook. At this point it's just sort of sad. But, FFG has done worse.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great little game.  The factions are neat and flavorful, the gameplay is fun and tense with a lot of bluffing and psychological games in addition to the core strategy.  

Because of the ability to take resources or cards at any time, and the fact that resources are non-renewable, it's much less susceptible to totally one-sided games than something like Magic.

Ok, I now see why this game is loved so much, I just know I will never be able to find the time to experience all this game has to offer since it is so hard to find others who are willing to get into this one. Seems to be the type of game you must play often.

Really unique game. The most asymmetrical game I have ever played. That said, it is also extremely balanced. My biggest issue is finding friends that are into this kind of game. If your friends are not, or have never been, into CCG's they may not like this kind of game. Even though it's not a CCG per-say, you still need to pre-build decks to be competitive and if friends do not like to do this or are bad at it, it may not be so fun crushing their faces over and over.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Maybe one of the "coolest" games ever made. The tactile feel of the tokens and card play, the stylish art, the whip-smart mechanics, the cyberpunk theme. The massive amounts of cyber jargon can be a bit of a barrier to entry but it really adds to the "cool" factor once you get it all down.

Everything about this game is awesome. I love how it's basically two completely different games that two people play against each other. The bluffing is amazing, and the game is brilliantly designed to give you many fun choices to make in every hand. All the factions use completely different playstyles which is great for replay value.

The LCG distribution model is great, so much better than having to buy random boosters. But you really don't need to buy the data packs, there's PLENTY of game in the base set.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Whilst the game was certainly different to other CCG I've played, the theme never grabbed me and was very narrow.
The game itself also was narrow in that it appeared to be, one player laying down walls and another breaking them down, with a possibility that at the end of a series of walls, was a trap.
I tried to like the game, since one of our gamers loved it but at best I was indifferent to it. I'd play it, but I would have sooner played the other FFG LCGs in the order LOTR, then Game of Thrones then Call of Cthulhu and then Netrunner

It's still the same asymetrical game of cat-and-mouse where you're never quite sure whether you are the cat or the mouse. The same great theme and mechanics.

The card design is brighter and more user-friendly. And having tight, themed, interesting decks straight out of the box is a definite plus.

I taught new players with just the release set and this remains a fine game with just those cards. I don't have the time or interest to keep up with a non-stop flood of new cards.

Fantastic card game that is wholly unique.  The clever cat and mouse game between Runner and Corp is visceral as the Runner goes head to head against the Corps defenses, often-times not knowing what he will run into.

The starter is well balanced, varied, and offers tons of replayability using only the preconstructed decks.  The deck building rules offer so many options that I don't know how anyone could possibly find this game getting stale anytime soon.

----------------------------------------

Update - I was very into Netrunner for a long period of time in the earlier period of its lifecycle.  I still have a great fondness for the mechanisms but the release cycle ground me out and beat me down.  Can't keep up with this behemoth and had to ditch it.

RATING: 8.3
I can see why this is so popular. The theme really comes through, the corp and runner feel totally different, and there's a healthy cloud of fear pervading the entire experience. Some games you play with your head, like chess. Other games you play with your gut, like poker. Netrunner strikes a perfect balance between the two.

That said, here are the cons:
- I'm not a fan of the setting. Cyberpunk is creepy.
- LCG's are expensive
- The deck-building seems a little flawed to me. A runner has to balance out their deck to break every possible type of ice, or risk matching up against an opponent who is impossible to beat. However, Corps don't necessarily have to load up on every type of ice, and might just focus on one or two types. That means that a lot of cards in the runner's deck may end up serving no purpose. I hate drawing useless cards.

I was super skeptical of this game as I am not a CCG/LCG kind of person, but I am surprised at how much fun it is just out of the box. It's basically as good an asymmetric game as I've played. Will I get into the whole meta deckbuilding aspect? Probably not, but it's nice to know there are games like this I can enjoy without feeling pressured to join in on that aspect.

This game does have a bit of a learning curve though, and some of that is thankfs to thematic terminology instead of more standardized terms, which is a huge pet peeve of mine. Still, once I got rolling I found the game quite enjoyable.

I’m sure this game gets better with repeated plays, but I’m rarely playing with just one other player. And when I am, I would much rather play Summoner Wars or similar card games! So even though I’m sure the game is okay, it’s just not something I personally want to dive into and explore – and even if I did, I still wouldn’t understand why it’s number 4 here on BGG, that seems way too high!

My only play was against a very experienced player who played with a sneaky corporation deck (can’t remember the name), so I knew before the game started that I would lose and that it would only be a learning game to see what the fuss was about. I’m just happy that I actually got 2 agenda points! But that was also partly because the corporation player’s first three scored agendas were the ones which give you the token which can permanently stop a run from the runner… Which is a huge benefit to the corporation! My opponent did state that he had been quite lucky with his cards, so that’s somewhat encouraging despite the fact that I got smashed 2-8! Still, even though the better player will win, I think there is a pretty big problem with the luck of the draw. It seemed pretty important to get the card which gives you 2 coins for each action instead of your basic 1, and I didn’t get that card until late in the game. Some cards are just important to get rather early to get an engine going. The luck of how your deck is shuffled also shows when you’re trying to make a run on the deck and you might reveal an agenda and score it or an ice and take some damage… Oh, and when you take damage the corp randomly discards some of your cards which might screw you or don’t have an impact at all…

It’s more like you are playing your opponent than the game itself; not sure if I like this. There is a lot of bluffing etc., which I’m not very keen on. I normally like bluffing in games, but not the way it works in this game as this is a more “serious” game than the bluffing you’re doing in games like Cash n Guns etc. (not that you can compare the two games at all but it’s just to explain why I wasn’t enamored with the element that you’re trying to figure out if your opponent is bluffing or not; it can be extremely costly if your guess is incorrect)!

I think the way the corp puts out his ice cards was quite cool as well as the various types of ice. And of course, the fact that he could be bluffing added to the tension (and I was probably way too defensive minded as a new and inexperienced player; I should have made more runs earlier). I love asymmetrical games, and next time I’m playing it (because I will – though that will probably be the last time), I’m going to play the corporation whose playing style I think I’m going to like the most. Oh, the theme and artwork seemed very bland and definitely didn’t help to improve my opinion about the game.
I would imagine that I would like the creation of your personal deck, but as I have stated I just don’t have the time to play this extensively, which I think it requires in order to shine. It definitely seems to reward repeated plays! However, as it stands, I think Garfield is one of the most overrated designers ever (Android, MtG and King of Tokyo all have ratings of less than 5).

I'm rating this based on the game play of A:N and not the base game alone. This game truly is a lifestyle game requiring lots of attention. It is very difficult to find players to play with regularly. The base game alone is not enough to have lots of replay but with the addition of data packs the options are there for a deeper more competitive experience. Like many LCGs, there is continuous change and additions. This game is great, and I will play anytime but it's to difficult to stay fluent, way too time consuming, but it is a great game. Lots of deck building.

I like how both sides play differently.  The corporation seems to be based on how lucky you are with your ICE draw.  If you don't get any, you're kind of screwed.  The runner doesn't seem to have this problem, as they always have options to run against until they get their breakers.  This is of course, after three plays, so my experience is minimum.

While I enjoy Netrunner quite a bit, and think the mechanics are solid. It's getting to the point where it's becoming too big of a game for me. Too many cards to keep track of, and too many variances. I know this is great for a lot of people, but not sure it's for me anymore...

I believe I've given some extra cards away, but I have 3x of every card in the core set.

Rated 7 after one play, but heck, that's a stab in the dark given the nature of the game. For a first play, I'm very intrigued. I love the asymmetrical roles, and though I played the runner, I suspect I'd have even more fun playing the corporation.

So why the low rating? I spent a heck of a time just preparing to teach and play the game, and even still, my first play involved a number of checks in the rulebook. The terminology of clicks, servers, assets, net damage, rezzing... yeesh. It's a lot to remember. There's plenty going on in the game, and it's hard to keep track.

Update: traded it away. I really like the game, but I just didn't have a partner to play this with me, and given the opportunity, I'd play A Game of Thrones the card game over this. It' rock solid though and I could get back into it with the right opportunity.

Ahh... but with familiarity... if I can find someone to stick through this with me, I think we're going to unearth a heck of a game.

Update: Five plays now, all with the same runner/corp combo, and I'm becoming a believer in this game. The potential cat and mouse between the two assymetrical positions, the bluffing, the flavor of the cards... this is really engaging once you get past the learning curve.

I've long been a fan of the original Netrunner.  On the up-side the developers seem to have learned a bit (and only a bit) from the original.  Here things like Urban Renewal have been toned down into Scorched Earth while aspects of the rare Proteus expansion are now common in play.  More importantly, cash flow seems tighten for the Corp (except when playing the Anarch runner idents) which leads to a more balanced contests.

My only concern is that the influence budget concept constrains deck building too much, but only time will tell.

Unfortunately, as I log more plays, my initial wariness of the identities/influence concept seems to be bearing out, dropping A:N's rating.  The HB Corp and the Anarch identity have issues.  I have yet to see deckbuilding correct these issues and hopefully future expansions will improve these two identities.

As typical of FFG releases, the rulebook is awful and there are ergonomic foibles aplenty.  The ICE cards don't seem to "flip" in any sort of intuitive way - i.e. when you flip them to their rez'ed side they're always upside down / backwards etc.  Despite the copious and generally clear rulebook their are dangling concepts: does play of a "held" token cost an action for example.  When read by a beginner, the rulebook is downright awful.  Why is it that this excellent game has never been able to be decently presented/described? Basic matters of play, such as how ICE is approached and what happens if your breakers are not strong enough are both verbose, and at the same time incomplete (covered in two decoupled sections).  The cards while often beautiful have dubious ergonomic choices.  Faction symbols and other values being placed in different locations as an example.  Finally, the franchise continues to use weird an often conflicting terms. that I'd have expected a republished version to have corrected.  I mean, let's call an "action" an "action" already!

The brightest thing FFG could have done was watch people teach Netrunner to their newbie friends.  People have been translating Netrunner's horrid rulebook and poor card ergonomics for over a decade ... they still have to.

At any rate, it's Netrunner, one of my OOP 10's, and the best CCG of all time.  It is great to see it back in play with a wide audience.  Netrunner is *so* good that it can survive the "FFG treatment".

One of the best TCGs ever made (Thank you Richard Garfield once again) has been revived in the best way imaginable. The LCG concept is great. You never lack the cards that make a deck really good, You always get all the cards available.
The Charakter and Corporation identities give the game an even more immersive flair, and ist easyer to fokus on speciffic strategies, than with the original.
For me the pace of new cardsets beeing released is a little too fast though.

Now this was a pleasant surprise. Having walked away disappointed from other CCG/LCG games in the past (Magic the Gathering, Legend of the 5 Rings and most recently, Warhammer 40000: Conquest), I didn't have high hopes for Netrunner. I was quickly converted after playing a few games, though. Bluffing as the corp is particularly satisfying (unsurprisingly, Jinteki is my favourite) and feels more involving than almost any MTG-inspired card game I've played before.

:indigo: :( :D Totally ready, steeling myself in fact, for this to be the latest bit of overpraised overproduced AT with $5 of ideas in a $30 box courtesy of the good folks at Fantasy Flight. Well, shut my mouf, because while I'm not ready to jump on the fanboi bandwagon for this, I found myself pleasantly surprised at every turn. I am a little peeved that the commitment to theme above everything encompasses such minor irritations as not calling a discard pile a goddamned discard pile, and I'm concerned that the number of decks may limit serious replay value if one does not purchase a grip of booster packs and start doing the custom-deckbuilding thing, which is a rabbit hole this rabbit would just as soon leave unplumbed. But for casual play on occasion, it would seem to work just fine as a standalone.

The game is great. GREAT. But the barrier to entry is just too damned high. Unless playing with exactly like minded players with similar skill abilities, this game is very hard to get on the table.

It is not a family friendly game. It is not a girlfriend friendly game. It is a hardcore competition game.

Treat this as a competitive CCG more than a boardgame and you will do well.

Absolutely blown away by this. Even though I've only managed a couple of 'real' games I've already developed something of an obsession. The theme immediately sucked me in and I'm massively intrigued by the deck building possibilities. Unfortunately I will need to look further afield for regular opponents as my gaming group aren't particularly interested in the 'deep end' of games.

UPDATE: After 9 months of ownership I have discovered that this is a pointless game to own unless someone shares your enthusiasm for it. This is likely to join ever growing list of games that I love but reluctantly sold on because they were gathering dust.

Netrunner has more player interaction than any other game I've played. Almost every game is a joy to play even if I am losing.

FFG's reboot of Garfield's classic the pinnacle of collectible games. If you want a game to tinker with, obsess over and show off your strange and powerful creations with friends... This is the game. This is it. I entreat you, I implore you. Get into the game before the cardpool becomes too daunting to fathom from the outside.

This game embodies our hobby like no other game can.

RATING: 1
A very nice assymetrical living card game with lots of theme. Demands a lot of skill and time to construct your deck and now the tricks of the trade. That makes this game very uninteresting to me but I can see that others would really love it.
One player is a computer hacker and the other the executive board of a megacorporation.
The hackers goal is to steal information from the corporation without getting caught by the private security companies emplyed by the corporations while the corporations has to protect their servers and advance their agendas so that they can earn more money and market shares.
The theme of the game really gives the feel of a Gibsonian cyberpunk world, along with the terminology.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I appreciate the asymmetrical nature of the game, the trade off in powers and costs, the theme, and the overall intent behind the design. So what's the problem?

It's two fold. 

First, there's not enough game actions to truly realize satisfying card plays because you have to spend too many of your actions dealing with the need for credits. The resulting experience is metaphorically like buying a ticket to a really fun amusement park that has tons of rides - but then you're told you only have 20 minutes to experience what you can before you have to leave. 

Some may enjoy this and describe it as "tense". To me, I feel tension from genuinely perplexing choices. The poker/bluffing element does offer a bit of that, but not enough to make up for the game's faults - at least not for me.

Second, sadly, I believe Netrunner is yet another example of where the deck building is really the source of fun for people. The games themselves are just instances of verifying or refuting the decisions made outside of the game in assembling the decks. That's not fun for me. I want a game where my opponent and I can take pre-made decks and still have fun in the game because of the circumstantial decisions provided by the game's mechanics. Netrunner simply doesn't have enough in that department.

Netrunner is a great game that I got rid of. Why? I just can't get into deckbuilding. I played with the premade faction decks, which was very fun. But the main draw of the game is to customize your own, which I have zero interest in. I like being given things and being told "do what you can with this". Spending hours agonizing over building your own is unfortunately not my cup of tea, which is a shame, because I can easily see the draw of this wonderfully tense, thematic, asymmetric game.

I just packed this game up for shipment in a math trade and its probably the saddest I've been to see a game leave my collection. I LOVE this game, but the LCG model just isn't for me. 

I'm not interested in playing competitively in a local scene (if there even is one) nor are any of my friends interested in playing semi-seriously and actually getting involved with the deck construction aspects. Finally, my regular game group has too many games competing for table time to reliably play a 2-player game with this sort of learning curve in a casual (base-only atmosphere). This this game really has no place in my life, but I wish things were different.

Thematic and mechanically sound, this long-awaited reboot delivers.  It's Netrunner, but with more interesting deckbuilding mechanics and a toned-down power curve on the cards.  I consider both changes in design philosophy to be improvements and look forward to the expansions.

[Edit:] With the arrival of regular expansion sets, Netrunner has easily become my favorite 2-player card game of all time.  It is deep, constantly shifting, and match outcomes very directly correlate to player skill.  All without sacrificing theme.  An easy ten.

I am giving this a 1 - not because it's a bad game or not well designed.  It's because I am trying to offset the irrational curve that is set by fan-based popularity vs. true and actual ratings.  Be my guest to investigate, but no other game on the charts has the same number of users rating it both 8 and 10.  You will also notice that every other game has a bell curve distribution where as this game does not.  Proves my view that this game is rated where it is not because of objective reviews, but of fan-based wet dreams being satisfied in theme.  The game is not all that.  It's OK for what it is.

In general, based on limited experience with both this and the original game I can say that it's a game that I can appreciate more than enjoy. The hidden information element of the game here is not implemented in a way that I find entirely satisfying. I love anything cyberpunk related, and the concept of asymmetrical play is always interesting, but I dislike the cat and mouse type gameplay of this one.

For those who aren't familiar with the basic concept, Netrunner is an asymmetrical game where one player represents a corporation, trying to protect their data from the other player who represents a hacker. The game structure is based on the corp erecting defences that can protect their agendas while the hacker tries their best to break through and steal them.

The LCG format is an interesting one for this game because many purists of the old game swore by totally random starter decks. I never cared for that as a format for serious games like this mainly because it seemed like it was eliminating a lot of potential long term depth for the sake of what? Not eliminating the silly unlimited copies of any card rule? Thankfully, FFG seems to have focused on the constructed concerns by instituting a 3-of rule and splitting the cards out into factions; thereby forcing each player to have some inherent weaknesses. 

The major downside I see with this game early is that for those who are inexperienced with the CCG/LCG format deck construction can be a bit overwhelming, and packaging the game like this means that it is not particularly approachable whereas a more staid, pre-constructed route would be moreso. 

That said, I do understand why the game was packaged this way: it creates more overhead and work for the player, but it also means the game has much more potential longevity and interest. Bravo to Wizards for licensing out this old game in any case, it has a lot of fans and I know that many people are very happy to have it available like this. Of course, none of that changes the fact that I am not particularly crazy about the gameplay of this one and generally prefer to avoid playing it.

I may give this a higher rating later if I ever pick this back up. I got it around the same time that I got into MTG and also Doomtown, so it took a back seat. The couple times I played were very cool.

Pros: Unique theme and mechanics, exceptional asymmetric play, captures thrilling "cat-mouse" tension throughout the tempo of the game.

Cons: Growing entry cost, bouts of meta "staleness" (only applicable to competitive play)

I've played Netrunner on a regular basis for about three years now, and it remains my "main" competitive card game. It brings so much uniqueness and depth to the table that it may be my favorite game over all, card or otherwise. It captures a thrilling tempo of cyberpunk cat and mouse as one player attempts to discover all the corporations dirty secrets through swift "hacking", and the corporation frantically attempts to address their vulnerabilities while simultaneously either advancing their nefarious hidden agendas, or simply trying to kill the hacker.

Searching for something negative to say, the entry cost of owning the game in its entirety has become large, though remains cheaper than playing Magic: The Gathering competitively. Additionally, players at a competitive level will note months-long bouts of meta "staleness," when particularly strong cards are released, which the developers are slow to address via a competitive play restricted list.

Still, this is reaching into the nuts and bolts to find the bad. My overall experience has been overwhelming positive, and it is why Netrunner is the only game I have consistently played on a weekly basis for years.

I love this game. It flows, the rules are nuanced and it's just basically fantastic. Loses a point due to really needing to buy at least two sets to be competitive in an organized scene. I will be picking up a third to construct many decks.

EDIT: The has held up since launch. However, it gets samey if you only play with one person, since bluffing is such a huge part of the game. When your opponent knows you, your deck matters less and your ability to switch up your bluff is king.

This game is really interesting. I've only played as a runner, but I enjoyed it a lot. The different kinds of ice add some randomness (it's pretty difficult to prepare against them, so you have to be ready for any contingencies), but this feels like a very tactical game. I'm not sure I want to invest in it, but I like the LCG model and like how the credit system allows you to exercise control over its flow (no such thing as getting creditscrewed or creditflooded).

I absolutely love this game. I love that you play the deck, rather than building a deck and having the deck play itself.  The bluffing mechanisms and gameplay really shine. There are a multitude of choices on your turn, and you never feel like you lose this game because of a bad draw.  You feel like the other player out-witted you, and things would have gone differently if you had played better.

It's been four months since release and we're above 80 plays (making it our most played game, ever) with no signs of slowing down.  This is my favorite game of all-time, bar none.

After following this for quiet a while, I finally was able to play it. Wow, I am not a big CCG/LCG player, but this game is unique and the theme is really appealing. This now high on my get list for the holiday season. Once I get it, I will have to try to convince my wife to play it.

Can't wait to play another game of this.

Very good, but you need a dedicated opponent or opponents to play with, and it ain't easy to teach. Because of the prominent bluffing and hidden information elements, it's easy for newbies (especially non-gamers) to wrongly feel like they are losing badly and get discouraged.

Love this game and can't get enough of it.  Every time I play, I find some new aspect of the strategy that I have never seen before.  It isn't for everybody, but if you can get through the intricate rules it is a rewarding game worth playing again and again.

RATING: 5
Update:
I'm not quite sure how to rate this anymore. I liked the base game, without custom deckbuilding, but then I went and bought a few expansion decks, and I see that you really have to do deckbuilding, and I feel like the life is sucked out of me. I have to do a solo game of build-my-deck before playing the game against another person. I don't like playing solo games, and I don't like deck-building. I tried just taking one faction, including expansions, and mixing in the neutrals, and it's just not that interesting anymore. To be fair, this is really a problem with me and the whole category of games that require/encourage deck-building as a solo activity prior to playing against a human (e.g. Mage Wars). Maybe I'll go see if there are standard decks or something (still work to build them, and annoying when switching factions, ugh), but for now I rate it like a 7 while I'm actually playing, and like a 3 for deck-building. So average to a 5 I guess.
-----
Preliminary rating. Seems pretty fun so far, but from just the base game, I don't see what all the hype is about. I'll order up a few expansion packs, but I'm not a big fan of deck construction, so I'm not sure if this will help. I'm hoping there's an option to just like shuffle a bunch of stuff together or something. We'll see.

You will want to play over and over again. What lifts it, other than the great theme, art and rules, is the sheer excitement of fending off Runners from your servers or planning you next run. Bluff, planning and risk = nerve jangling game. Might be my favourite game now.

Played for a period, but I ultimately realised that this wasn't the right LCG for me (that would be LotR). I don't have the time or inclination to make new friends in order to play a game, it's too long to act as a quick filler before a game between 2 people (like Magic can). I dislike the faction and player imbalance, and found the routine of running servers uninspiring. The theme also falls flat for me. I can see how other people might like this, particularly if they buy into the paradigm of "Corps are universally evil".

Still trying to figure out whether I like this game or not. Quick setup, so I like that. One issue is there's a fair amount of rules here that really limit the creativity and options of the player. While there's certainly some strategy, I don't feel like it's all that deep.

Has all the random draw problems of MtG; massive drought of the cards you need until you dont need them anymore, then loads.  The game (like MtG) is a crap shoot, where you can lose an hour long game when your opponent pulls 3 agendas off your deck in one run.  Cards you never saw.  Using a card from their hand you never saw.

Maybe it gets better with plays, but I have a hundred games (no lie) that I want to play already, so I don't feel the need to work on liking one more.

I prefer this over MtG, but that doesn't say much.

The ultimate 2player only card game. Rules are actually quit simple after getting the terminology. 2 players play very differently is a big plus. In-game play is very dense and exciting which requires strategic planning, tactical decisions, and lots bluffing. The meta-game of deck building should be fun too. Major complaint is the terminology/theme is hard to teach to new players.
Might not need to purchase another core set just to get extra copies of about 10 powerful cards. Those cards are very powerful and might destroy game balance if not playing competitively.

After only [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/play/details/13664658]one game[/url], only having seen a small fraction of the cards and not having read the rules myself (albeit having had a thorough explanation, thanks [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/user/Sarix87]Sarix87[/url]!), I don't feel qualified to rate this game yet.
Suffice it to say that I see the potential to really like it if I were to put in the time and energy to really get to know it.
However, the frequency with which new expansion packs are published - once per month - turns me off. It looks too time consuming to stay up to date (not to mention quite expensive as well). I want to play a game like this completely or not at all. Limiting myself to certain expansions doesn't seem attractive to me as it would severely limit my ability to find opponents (of course I would only want to play against people who accept the same expansion limitation then). Not being up to date would even limit my ability to just discuss the game with others, something which I enjoy in games a lot as well.
Who knows, maybe I'll change my mind about Android: Netrunner sometime, maybe in case the steady stream of expansions slows down before they reach several thousand different cards... :-/

I really want to like this game. It has beautiful card art. The theme is great and I like the mechanics of the game.

But...I have to play this game at least 7 times to actually understand how every different faction works. Then I would have to build a deck and test it a few times to actually get into the fun part of the game. I could do that, however, no one in my group has this game and I doubt that they would be inclined to go through the learning curve of this game, so I can't see how this game could hit my table.

I may change this rating if that miracle happens.

A cool cyberpunk, purely adversarial, living card game.  I have played a few number of games as a runner and a corporation and the experience is exhilarating.  Renegade hackers tricking out their rigs, getting juiced up on Diesel energy drinks, and making runs at Corporate baddies hiding behind harassing, annoying, or downright deadly ICE to crack open their plans hiding in their pristine servers.  Corporations trying to set devious traps or sending their goons out to beat up a tagged hacker while they pursue their nefarious objectives.  I love the hidden information aspect of the game and the mechanic is quite clean.  And what's not to love about a game that can see you suffer from brain damage (complete with a little brain counter for keeping track of it).  I really like this one!

No voy a hacer ningún comentario de este juego. Sólo diré que es la obra maestra de mi colección, y que el vicio que le llevo no tiene nombre. Por decir algo malo, que es jodidísimo de enseñar a amigos, lo mejor es jugar con gente que se lo compra porque lo quiere.
27/03/16: Ya llevo tiempo con el Netrunner abandonado... la cantidad de tiempo que requiere para tener un nivel digno es abrumadora, y al final no hay tiempo para testear todas las cartas que salen. Y personalmente, creo que cada vez va a peor, las cartas que salen desvirtuan el juego y no lo mejoran, sino todo lo contrario... no me arrepiento de haberlo dejado en su mejor momento.

There is a decent and intriguing system at work here, but overall it feels a bit passive and a bit much like a waiting game.  Often times you sit there, unable to make your more, or grinning across the table collecting money as the corp.  I was hoping it would be a little faster paced or more intense.  Could be an opponent problem (overly conservative opponent).

RATING: 9.5
I think its an amazing game- has everything I want out of a card game; Bluffing, targeted removal, resource management, options to use cards on your opponents turn. Really all the things I want out of a great game.

The theme is gorgeous, and as a fan of cyberpunk- I am absolutely in love. 

The game is just as balanced as any other card game, lots of back and forth. 

I am a fan of the LCG model- $15 a month is nothing to a CCG player. Organized play and competitive environment is the only real reason I ever pay to play CCGs...so the fact that A:NR has that scores it very high for me.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I grew up reading cyberpunk SF by William Gibson (Neuromancer, Johnny Mnemonic, Burning Chrome) and Neal Stephenson (Snow Crash, The Diamond Age), so I love the theme of this game! The rules are more complicated than they need to be, and they can be surprisingly difficult to learn. It doesn't help that Fantasy Flight's rule book is poorly structured and way too vague, and the card text isn't any better. But gameplay is deep and worth the effort. I find the draw mechanism to be a little too luck-based than I would prefer, and deck customization isn't as easy as Star Wars: The Card Game. Playing as the Corporation is passive and may not appeal to players who prefer more active gameplay.

Rating History:

As of Mar '16 (57 plays) - 9.5. Redoing rating and upgrading to 9.5 because it's one of my favorite games still. Not a 10 because of the FAQ that needs to go along with the game. Also fixing the balance with the NAPD Most Wanted List in official tournaments.

As of Jan '15 (41 plays) - 8. This is my and my wife's goto 1v1 game of choice. I only play this game with my wife. I tried introducing it to my X-Wing friend (ex-magic player), and he thought it was too random. I don't play in any leagues or anything like that. I also eventually bought the the first and second cycle of data packs. All of these factors affect how I rate this game. I guess without the data packs, I would rate this game a 6.5.

Things I enjoy about this game: Spending the time building a deck. Feeling sneaky and playing agressively as a Runner accessing cards. Feeling scared and playing defensively as the Corp with not enough ice or money to rez them.

Things I don't enjoy about this game: Teaching the vocabulary. It's a lot of jargon that does make you sound like a hacker in the end, but it's a lot to teach. The feeling that I need to get more data packs (although with the new tournament rotation, I may only need to focus on Deluxe Expansions). My wife thinks we have enough cards, but I'm sort of a completionist. And I don't like it when the shuffle don't go my way.

Games we'd rather play than this: My wife and I love co-ops, so we'd rather play 2-player Pandemic or Sherlock Holmes. For 1v1 games, My wife and I would prabably rather play What's My Word. My buddy and I would be playing X-Wing Miniatures Game instead. I don't own or have any interest in owning any other CCG or LCG, so NetRunner would be my only game for that. 

Rating as of Jul '14 - 7.5. Would've been an 8, but I don't normally see myself recommending this game since I don't play maybe 1-on-1 games except with my wife. I do recommend this game all the time to her, but I can't want to play this everyday with her.

Really cool idea, I love the game in concept. I attempted to go to a "Netrunner" night once though, and my starter deck was nowhere near what was neccessary to play. I was hoping it would be different from Magic as far as costs, but it would have cost around $300 to get competitive with a deck. Great concept, love the LCG in idea, seems like a fun balance, but price creep is definitely in full swing with this one.

RATING: 10
Largely got out of CCGs in the 90s, after playing M:tG since Beta. The collectable/money sink aspect put me off. As a result I also don't look at card games much at all, probably uncalled for but there you go. 

So when my son brought over a copy of Android: Netrunner, I was not that enthused. It's a "Living Card Game", meaning that cards are not sold randomly, but there are regular releases of new cards. Hmmmmmm...

After playing it for a few weeks now, with only the base set (self contained, enough cards for multiple decks, for about $40), I'm smitten. Early, but I give this game a "10" because it is such a marvelous design. 

It is truly asymmetrical, each side (it's 2 player) has literally different rules. The interaction is constant; the "Runner" attacks, the "Corporation" defends. Unless the Corporation unleashes a counter attack, and the hunter becomes the hunted. Unless he's smart, and it's just bait to see what the Corp can do so he can launch another "run" (attack) with better knowledge. Unless...

I could go on, but instead just look online for reviews. There's a reason people go gaga over this game, it really is that good!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I think this is a great game.  Because of the asymmetric game design, you basically have to learn the rules twice.  But it's worth it to have an asymmetric game that actually works and is enjoyable.

In an odd way, it reminds of Maria:  the players are not similarly situated, but none has the advantage.

Not a huge fan of card games so I kind of overlooked this one.
However after all the great reviews, the enthusiastic comments and the steady flow of high votes during all these months I finally decided to give it a spin, and guess what? ... I fell in love.

I've played 10-12 virtual games on Octagon just with the core set and I value this a fantastic game. 
Superb asymmetric play with lots of tense moment, great variety in faction strategy and theme is drippin from every pore.
Most of the time I'm having a blast, sometimes ANR makes me want to rage quit but thats my arch-enemy, Mr Randomness

Netrunner is an assymmetric game where both roles (corporation and runner) play very differently. There is a big bluffing element as the corporation builds up hidden defences and tries to score while the runner is building up his rig and attacking the servers. Surprisingly, the base set seems to offer seven decent decks that will offer a lot of playtime for casual players. In the end I still sold this, because the LCG format is a deal breaker for me.

This is just such a smart, thematic, tight game.  I only have the base set and don't get to play as much as I'd like.  It is worth it even if you don't collect every expansion as a great 2 player game off the shelf.

Fun fast moving two player card game, that has bluffing and a different deck for each player. Takes a while to get through a poor set of rules and benefits from knowing the deck, so there's a learning phase, but well worth it. Even if the strong cyberpunk theme isn't for you, the underlying game is worth it.

Android Netrunner has tons of theme, artwork I like, and a concept that is interesting.  I like the differences of each side, and the victory conditions of each player make sense to me.  What I don't like it the use of hidden information in the game.  I am a big fan of hidden information, but it seems like the there needs to be some hidden information when cards are played on the Runner side of the board.  I'm sure the game is balanced for this, but it's too big of a difference for me.

The game - 9/10. I love the gameplay, the theme, the asymmetry and the feel.

The rate at which FFG is releasing new data packs - 3/10.
I bought a few and realised that they are releasing new stuff WAY too fast for me. To keep up with the new cards to be able to play in tournaments etc. would basically mean making Netrunner your second job. I don't want that.
Playing casually is difficult because active players want to keep up with the data packs.

tl;dr: Great game, the LCG system is not for me.

RATING: 7
This is probably my #1 favorite card game. There is so much involved in the game and there are so many ways to build your deck and different ways to play to win. You can build decks with multiple strategies and both can work to win you a game. 

I think I like the asymmetrical nature of the game most. It makes you have to learn to play both sides in order to really get good at it. 

Update: I've dropped my rating on this game. While I really like it, I don't play it much anymore. Not as many people in my group play it and there is too much prepwork needed to build a deck that works well with all the cards.

I really enjoy ANR. I have played a lot of MTG and this is a breath of fresh air for me. Sadly I don't own anything but the Core set yet so I don't have a lot of Deck building options. Very fun though. I've played it almost every night with the wife.

Gameplay is fun, but it suffers from the same problem as magic and all CCGs LCGs, and that's prepwork.  I have no interest spending 10 hours of prepwork building a damn deck for an hour long game.  I'll play a pickup game any day of the week if you build me the deck.  Otherwise, pass.

EDIT:  I'm starting to come around on this one.  Trying to take it slow lest I get too overwhelmed.  The gameplay is too good to ignore.

RATING: 7
This is a good game, but not well suited for casual play, due to the learning curve on one hand and the fact that most players seem to devote a lot more time to it than I have available.  I get the impression I'd like this game a lot more if I could play it, but everyone I know either doesn't play & thinks it's too complicated to learn, or plays it very seriously & is way over my level.  It does, however, seem like it would be an ideal game for a couple that wanted to learn it together.

My very first foray into the living card game scene, Android: Netrunner is game where you either play as a corporation trying to get it's "dastardly" agendas completed before the runner player steals your agendas and wins.

A fabulous game, probably my favorite two player. A completely different game if you are playing the runner or the corp, which, along with all the jargon, can make it very difficult to teach. But once you know how to play the constant bluffing, risk, and clever card combinations make it great. No two games are the same. If I were to dump all my other games and play only one, this would be it.

As a previous MTG player, I liked the concept and art of Android: Netrunner.  The LCG model appealed to prevent pay to win feelings.  I never really enjoyed the game that much after a couple of tourneys and friendlies I sold this one on. Too asymmetric for me, not enough interaction.

RATING: 9
With just the core set alone there's so much variety and game to get out of the box.  With an ever expanding cardbase and a super competitive culture, it can feel overwhelming, but if you have someone to start with who's a newbie too, you can grow into it together and go as deep as you choose.  You don't need to go very deep for the game to feel very large in terms of possiblities.  The actual mechanics are really fun, very tense, and usually things workout so that you feel like you playing a balanced head to head.  Sometimes however the corp can get screwed, and with a low total of 7 agenda points needed to win, things can change very dramatically in one quick move of skill or good fortune.  Ultimately it doesn't feel as purely strategic as say, Magic did to me many years ago when I used to play it, but i'm sure many would argue with me on that one!

1v1 card game similar to Magic: The Gathering (same designer), yet doesn't suffer from the collectible aspect or the "land problem" its predecessor did. 
Both sides play very different from each other, and the game seems pretty solid so far.
Rating lowered a bit, as I'm just never very excited to play this. I have zero desire to construct my own deck(s), and I'm fairly indifferent about the game itself.
My 6 rating is on the gameplay itself. If I had to rate it based on both deck construction and gameplay, then I'd drop it to a 5 max.

Only giving this game a 5 because it is complex enough to intrigue me. I only own the base game, so I am only going to rate that. Having quite a bit of MTG or the Star Wars LCC etc, I was naturally interested in A:NR - and this also probably heavily influences my rather mediocre rating of this game.

After about 12-15 games, I just feel like there is so little direct interaction in this game which drags it out a very long time if the runner stays passive. And even though bluffing and a certain amount of luck in games are great, it seemed to me that there were way too many games won by lucky draws after hq/R&D runs or the runner trying to tap the wrong of 2 seemingly equal servers.

This probably gets better when you have more cards thus more options to build more synergistic decks, but the base game didn't convince me. It's actually noticably long when you play carefully and down to guessing if you play it risky.

This is to be taken with a grain of salt, of course - i am judging this (probably unfairly) through thr eyes of a person that loves mtg. Maybe I've not given NR the attention it deserves, maybe I'd just need to invest in a few expansions to get more of what I want... But to be honest, Netrunner didn't intrigue me enough to do so.

It's by no means a bad game. I'm just writing this because I am really surprised how much hype it gets.

RATING: 8
Brilliant card game that benefits greatly from the LCG format. The asymmetrical structure and the extremely well thought out mechanics makes this a deep and strategic experience on a level that few card games can compare to.

It's still understandable that it never reached where Magic went, because it's not as accessible and lacks some of the adolescent "cool factor" that drives the whole Magic experience.

Overall, it's still the superior game.

This is a great LCG title. Sadly, there is not a lot of people around me who enjoy this game, so I don't get to play this very often and that's why I am not planning to get any expansions for it. Still, it's a very enjoyable to play it with base set only.

A great game, but one that taught me that I don't really enjoy raw competitiveness in two player games.  It's also very much a lifestyle game, and I don't have the time or energy for that sort of malarky. Plus I find the LCG model only slightly less distasteful than CCGs.

Extremely fun game, difficult to learn on your own. Youtube videos were extremely helpful, as well as the subreddit. There is so much strategy involved, you can play aggressive and try to flat line the runner as the corporation, or run nonstop to get the corp to run out of credits; or you can play a slow game and try to deck the corp as a runner, and try to set up traps, and score agendas as the corp. Fun Fun game, I'm just starting to scratch the surface of the meta, and I only have the starter set. 

Worth the effort in learning the game!!

This is a quick to set up, dynamic, strategic, and surprisingly fun game.  My wife and I play it (I'm usually the corporation, she's the runner).

RATING: 8
Pretty cool two-player, assymetric card game with one player as the "hacker" and the other as the "corporation". Includes a limited deck building aspect where cards are worth points, and you're only allowed a certain number of points, so it avoids the spend-to-win situation of [i]Magic: The Gathering[/i], but you can still tailor your decks somewhat.

Update: I would stop at the end of the Genesis Cycle, i.e. the Core set plus the first six expansions. Creation and Control, and the Spin Cycle, wreck the game with ridiculous recursion and economy for the Runner. See my comments on Creation and Control.

I've also dropped my rating a bit because of the major imbalance they've introduced. On top of that, there are simply too many rules/timing questions now, so much so that they had to update their "anatomy of a run" to ridiculous levels of detail, and there are still tons of rules questions on the forums. Not fun.

Update 2: Sold. Too many cards too fast, too many obviously inferior cards, and too much arms escalation.

RATING: 8
Fun game as long as you have someone to play with casually. The competitive nature and constantly shifting meta makes it hard to play with someone random. Either you need to teach it to someone to play with you (and teaching the game is a real chore), or you end up playing against someone who has meticulously optimized their deck and play style.

The classic 1996 CCG Netrunner has been reborn! Players assume the roles of either the corporation or runners (hackers). As the corporation, your main goal is to advance Agendas while playing poker-face deceit and bolstering defences to thwart off the constant "runs" of the hackers. As the runners, your main goal is simply to make "runs" at the corporations servers, bypassing securities and eventually retrieving valuable Agendas. 

A great remake with plenty of player interaction with high tensions. Highly recommended for sci-fi fans!

While it is a very heavily structured game, and does not have as strong as a "checks and balances" feature like Magic's counterspells or mana system, all of the structure of the game board and rules is well worth learning. Nothing like it, and I don't know if anything will come close to being like it.

UPDATE - really dislike what FFG have done with the rotation - dropped out of buying at the point rotation kicks in - another seedy money play by FFG. Game rating still an 8.5 but rating dropped to reflect the management of the game.

Mechanically I think this is the best of FFG's LCG card games - it shows it's external design heritage by being a much more elegant and less clunky design than they typically come up with in-house. The draw deck, hand and discard piles being 'servers' in the same way as the servers that you deploy to is very clever. 

It also feels much more natural as a game. i.e. there are definite sides (runner or corp) to which you belong, competing against each other, rather than something like the 'Cthulhu' LCG, where you are competing for 'stories' - what does that really mean? So really good in terms of gameplay.

- The usual FFG base game ploy of releasing some cards with less than 3 copies, thus requiring the purchase of more than one base set, to enable proper deck-building. I accept FFG's rationale of having some cards in the base set with less than 3 copies to allow a greater variety of cards to be included, but their refusal to release some form of supplementary pack, to bump the limited release cards up to 3 copies, just smacks of crude/naked profiteering.

Great game even with just one core set and no deck building at all. I like that the two sides plays totally different and each have their strength and weaknesses. The problem with this no modifying approach is that after a while you know what each deck contains which might be a problem.

Players represent either a corporation, or a computer hacker, trying to control Agendas to score them as victory points.  Smooth playing two player card game, where each player plays from their own deck, but is trying to score Agenda cards that exist only in the corporation deck.  Players take turns spending a limited amount of actions ("clicks") to get an economy up and running, equipment deployed, and resources stocked up.  The heart of the game is the "run", where the hacker player attempts to access cards on the corporation side of the table.  The hacker uses assets to aid in the run, while the corporation defends their holdings with "ICE" software cards.  Terrific, tense, but very playable game - well designed, some good, interesting assymetry between the two sides.  Really enjoying this one.

I love this game, but it's hard to get it played. It's got one of the highest learning curves I've encountered so it's difficult to introduce to new players, and my wife (who loves games like Magic and Thunderstone) finds it a bit too stressful to be fun. Then there's the sheer volume of content which is nearly impossible to keep up with unless you make it the center of your gaming hobby. I'll probably hang on to my cards for a while more, but may end up selling them :-(

I have been a rabid fan of NetRunner for many years, but finding anyone else with interest has been a nonstarter. Thanks to this re-release, I can finally get this classic back to the table. 

This is the first thing Fantasy Flight has done right by me. With FFG's notoriety for unplayable initial releases that rely on expansion patches, there was deserved anxiety to find FFG had picked up the license. It's a releif that they didn't drop the ball on one of my treasured favorites.

Looking forward to more card options to expand the customizing.

Netrunner is hands down one of the best card games for 2 players. 
While I still  hate Fantasy Flight Games because of their packaging/sale schemes, the current Kickstarter-Craze made me rethink my grudge. I still rather play a very good game by a dubios company then a bloated + mechanically weak fanboy hyped BS by some nice and BGG friendly "game designer".

Sadly the theme makes it difficult to find players.

Bought this based on hype around the game. Beautiful artwork but not sure about the mechanics. Not all members of our family like to play PvP games that directly attack another, so you need the right person to play against. Much prefer the co-op of LOTR LCG over this one. Might consider trading it at some point if it doesn't get played again this year.

Only played this with the base game, but even this is already great fun. Although the terminology is very confusing at first, it really matches the theme. But I have to say, that the theme is not my favourite one. 
The sides play rather different, to the extent that they follow different rules and different mechanisms, which also adds to the first-playing-difficulties, but I really like such asymmetrical gameplay. 
The game builds up a nice level of tension, with opponents bluffing and tricking each over.
Really like to play this again, sometimes.

I have been a fan of MTG for a long time, so was really excited to see this game by Richard Garfield get re-printed and re-branded by FFG.  The game has not disappointed.  After several plays I just found the mechanics less and less compelling.  The corporation needs to be clever and hide crucial information, the runner works to get what info they can and both sides regularly have to balance risk/reward with each action.

6 on the Cindometer - there is a girl runner :)

This game is my jam. If this isn't a love letter to William Gibson's "Neuromancer"...

This game blows my mind as to how steeped it is in that world and at the same times delivers a tightly constructed design.

This game just blows my mind.  I have no idea how it could get any better.  You always feel like you're one turn away from winning AND losing.  Every turn is insanely tense.  Every game results in players talking about what they did, why they did it, and what they should have done differently.  There's not much more rewarding in a 2-player card game than stealing an agenda.  There's not much more that sucks when the runner steals one from you as the Corporation.  Sweat out every turn.  Stare your opponent down.  Good luck.  Buy this now.  Buy this now.  Buy this now.

The good news is that FFG has kept 95% of the original design intact.   Minor changes to traces, some keywords revised, slightly more Agenda points required in the deck.   Corp and Runner faction identites have been added, and after many plays I'm convinced that they add a valuable element to the metagame, along with the influence and deck-building rules.  Really good work there, FFG.

The bad news is that the starter box is extremely watered down.  For $25 you can get this, which has 7 starter decks in it.  The problem is that the cards are duplicated so frequently that after one play, you've pretty much seen all there is to see with a particular deck.  The decks feel totally incomplete (and they are). For the same price, you can get two 60-card original decks on eBay and get 120 unique cards, all of which have more "oomph" than these FFG cards.   Those WOTC decks have 30+ plays in them, easily.  Easily.  So the FFG version of the game is going to require constant and substantial expansion to get up to the level of what the original game can still give you.  The FFG Netrunner is going to be a very expensive game if you commit to it.   I'll keep up with it for a while, but I don't know that I would recommend this version to a new player unless they are willing to spend $100+....errr...  $200+.

The value in the FFG box is a 6.  The game design itself is a 9, however, and probably a 10 in it's fully fleshed-out form.

I loved netrunner and would easily have been a 9/10 until the end of the second cycle or at the latest the mumbad cycle. Sadly netrunner just went horribly wrong when the cards being produced stop the game doing what was most exciting about it. (for example faust or caprice). Although they have tried to fix these things with the new core set i feel that i won't return to playing netrunner until they pull the game back to the core parts of what made the game so good to play in the first place!!!

I want to love this game. The asymmetry between Corp and Runner is intriguing, and the game of bluff and misdirection is spot-on. It's perfect for the theme - when playing the Corp, you feel scheme-y and sneaky as you place your traps and lure the Runner into traps; when playing the Runner, getting past the various obstacles feels like you're outsmarting the massive opponent, against all odds, hacking through their every defense.

I, unfortunately, cannot play - I need an opponent of somewhat equal skill. When introduce it to someone new, I need to act as a teacher and guide - walking them through the game's complex systems. Afterwards, they'll generally be impressed with the game, but we'll never get around to playing again. On the other end, I went to a Android: Netrunner night at my local game store and was thoroughly trounced - and, to make it worse, mocked by arrogant opponents for my poor choice of cards.

 Should get a 10 from me considering it's been a borderline obsession over the past 2-3 years but the meta defines how much fun i'm having. However, the meta never detracts from how intensely competitive the game can be. More importantly but irrelevant to the score, I've made some amazing friends through the UK netrunner scene and cant recommend it enough to people who want to get into something truly strategic and rewarding.

Always liked to play the original Netrunner game. Asymmetrical play for two players. One is the Corporate IT department and other is trying to gain access.
It is a LCG so its costs will go up as you need to buy more cards in you want to play with the serious players or in tournaments.
HOWever if you have the base board game then you can have fun with your friends. The best way to learn to play is to watch the video called "How to Play Android Netrunner: Complete Tutorial". Then start in the rulebook.

I'm a sucker for cyberpunk (Mike Pondsmith is the man!) but this took some getting into. We're still playing with just the core set, which offers a ton of gameplay in its own right. Lots of tension and bluffing in a cat and mouse game with totally asymmetrical sides. We have an expansion to chuck in as well some time - not sure how deep down that rabbit hole (pardon the pun) I want to go though... Once you get your head around the jargon I think it really immerses you in the theme. You find yourself actually speaking and understand this mysterious lingo of future tech geeks: runs, ice, grips, stacks, heaps, servers, subroutines. Great fun.

RATING: 9.5
I was introduced to the new Android version of netrunner when it came out, and have kind of fallen in love with the game since then.  I find it scratches a different itch than other card games, focusing more on bluff and risk management than pure calculation (though there is a lot of that as well).  Instead of having monsters attacking each other, the game system is a race for position and economy.  Above even those issues, [i]time[/i] is the most important factor, as actions are precious and you can only do so much in a turn.   

If I have any complaints at all about the game, it would be either with the randomness or the length.  Anyone can tell you about a corp game when the runner beat all the odds and grabbed enough points to win (or at least an insurmountable lead).  Even if you play well, drawing a hand full of agendas without the support necessary to protect them is deadly.  Runners aren't immune to these problems, but have far more card-draw and tutoring effects available to them.  
The game can end swiftly in such cases, but most of the time will go longer than other card games.  There is a kind of compulsion to play to the end, even if you don't really have a chance to win.  I've rarely seen people concede, even if their position is all but hopeless.  This is because there's so much hidden information that even if things seem bad to them, there's still a chance their opponents won't spot the weakness or will make a mistake.  Even if one player is crushing, it may take them a while to secure the win, just because they have to find the agendas in order to score points.

These are minor issues, though.  Un/lucky draws are unavoidable in card games, and as long as the players are enjoying themselves, length is largely immaterial.  

Aside from that, my biggest issue with it is the balance.  FFG seems to be doing a pretty good job, but there are still too many decks, in my estimation, that rely on the same types of cards to win.  The anarch faction has viruses that can easily destroy defenses many times their own cost, and can be recurred repeatedly.  Corps, meanwhile, seem to disdain these defenses, and just fast-advance their agendas through.  Each side wants to interact with the other as little as possible in order to coast to victory, and this does not make the game as fun or interesting to play.
FFG has realized the power of these stale archetypes, and printed cards specifically to answer them.  But, there are answers to the answers, and these types of decks remain.  It's just a little frustrating to see the card pool get littered with 'must-run' cards designed to hose specific builds, and having to try and find room for a substantial portion in your deck.

Anyway, I play casually more than for tournament victories, so these problems are less noticeable to me.  I've even been surprised at the power of some of my wonky theme decks, once properly upgraded to compete in the occasional local events.  The game offers a nice mix of factions, strategies, and deck-building challenges (much more so now that the card pool's big than it did at the beginning), and as long as it keeps supplying that, I'll keep trying to play it.

Richard Garfield, the father of Magic the Gathering, delves into William Gibson by creating this super cool cyberpunk duel with cards and a bunch of tokens.
Very interesting asymmetrical gameplay, where one player is the Evil Corporation and will install servers, and softwares and firewalls to progress their agenda and protect their valuable data, while the other will act as the Netrunner - the hacker - and will use specialised software, icebrakers and whatnot to break into the company's databases to prevent them from reaching their goals. But if they are not good enough the company's security measures could fry their brains.

Definitely my favorite competitive game. A masterpiece.
The asymmetric mechanic is ingenious and in combination with LCG concept of regular deck updates it makes the perfect hobby game.
Together with wonderful cyberpunk theme (or cyber noire as designers say) which I love so much there is really awesome artwork and completely fresh terminology connected to the theme. Originally designed by Richard Garfield.
I own 2 copies of base set because I am close to serious.

However, I neither have nor want to spend as much time on this game as I would need to play it well. But I still hope to get quite some fun out of it in treating it as one game of several - albeit one which gets a little more time than others...

This is a fun, asymmetric, clever game. 

Have bought all expansions up to Data and Destiny.

One player plays a weird cross between Poker and Labyrinth. 

The other player plays something that resembles a cross between Master Thief and Magic the Gathering.

The theme is awesome, and shines through the way the game plays. I have a particular fancy for cards from the NBN and Weyland factions, as they closely resemble my actual life in a large corporation.

I played this weekly for about 3 months, and I intend to get back into it. 

Only issue - it's a bit intense, and you feel brain burned after playing it for a few games. Semantics.

I enjoy the asymmetrical head to head design and the theme is very cool.  There is a bit of luck when it comes to drawing cards.  It feels like the longer it takes agendas to get drawn, the more powerful the corporation can get (compared to the runner).  However, I can't be sure due to limited plays thus far.  I've only played the runner and need to try the corporation and deck building.  At that point, I may revise my rating.

RATING: 1
(If I wasn't so angry at how disappointed I am in this game after all the hype it got, I'd probably score it closer to a 3)

Notice how many of the people who rated this game a 10 already played and loved the original.

One more example of a game loaded up so heavily on theme that the gameplay totally suffered. I really, really don't know why this game has gathered as much popularity as it has.

It should be noted that this is NOT a strategy game, it is a BLUFFING game. 

Pros:
-the theme is super cool

Cons:
-for a deck-building game, the base game offers VERY little variety in how decks can be built. Expansions are desperately needed before the deck-building aspect starts to get even remotely interesting.
-the theme is taken so seriously that you have to learn an entirely new vernacular just to learn the game (example: the deck of cards a player draws from is never called their "deck". It actually has a different name depending on whether you're playing the Corporation or the Runner - and you need to memorize the correct name for both, as cards will affect them)
-once you look past all the theme, you realize the whole game is nothing more than the Runner randomly picking from a series of face-down cards and hoping he doesn't pick the wrong one

If you're really, really, REALLY into cyberpunk, go ahead and buy this game. Otherwise, The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is better in terms of gameplay and in deck-building options, and its story-driven format is just as exciting thematically. If you really want to get into Living Card Games, my suggestion is to get into LotR rather than this one.

The theme of a cyberhacker trying to take down a company's servers is executed in a very fun way.  It is a words-on-cards game, but that never bothered me.

An asymmetrical two player card game with great artwork and a fairly solid theme. Playing either side is an exercise in bluffing and perseverance.

I'm surprised a game like Netrunner was designed back in 1996.  Why do I say that?  You win by getting the most victory points (common for boardgames but not so much CCGs).  Well, in this game they are Agenda points, but you know what I mean.  Beyond that, the game uses an action point system which became popular in a lot of Euros (ie Pandemic, Tikal, Chaos in the Old World, etc).  This game would also overcome issues of other CCG's which tie currency to the cards that you draw.  All this leads to an extremely well designed game, particularly back in 1996.

It's surprising that it wasn't very successful for it's time and was cancelled.  That is until FFG acquired the rights to the game and re-released it in their Android universe.  The only thing that's really changed with the game is that cards are now designated into factions which greatly affects deck construction.  Most people see this as an improvement to the original design.  Anyone who has interest in CCG's/LCG's owes it to themselves to try this one out.

I decided against keeping it in my collection because I'm not really into any customizable games that require time outside of a game day to play.  The basic starter decks from 1 Core Set is not enjoyable enough after having experienced deck construction.

Netrunner is so complex but incredible. I love the runs and the theme, amazing bluffing elements too, and some brilliant maths!  I overdid it when I entered 'the scene', and have toned it down now. Despite all the cards I now own, the base game alone is great, and hopefully I'll play more of this (and some Terminal Directive!)
It's also the coolest game.

RATING: 5
Fun two player game, with a theme that manages to squeak through, and asymmetry that helps mix up the first few plays. But, without data packs the game runs dry fairly quickly, so unless you want to competitively deck build against your gaming friends, which would likely be quite fun, I'd steer clear. This game just isn't for me.

RATING: 9
This is basically the classic Netrunner, updated with some better bits, and factions.  A great asymmetrical 2 player card game!  I'm not thrilled that there's only 3 copies of each card in the box, though, as that may mean purchasing multiple copies if you want to deckbuild.  I think this'll become less of a problem as more cards are released in the Genesis cycle, though.  Probably not a big deal...

A master piece. The theme is incorporated fantastically and the gameplay is very different from other CCG/LCG style games. I personally prefer a different resource system, but in this game it does work, and not sure if a different system would improve it, probably the opposite in this case. 
Other then that, so much to think about, so many options, I love, love, love the bluffing and double guessing and the atmosphere is just so tense. All corps and runners play very differently too.

Not that easy to explain though, but definitely worth it!

RATING: 9
More or less the game it always was. I was expecting FFG to totally botch this title, and I was pleasantly surprised by its implementation. There are some minor rule changes from the original, but I didn't see anything worth getting up on a soap box about. I currently do not have plans to own this one. I only am interested in casual play and a bunch of old cards or new cards will easily satisfy that need. If you are interested in playing Netrunner casually buy whichever you can acquire cheaper. If you're interested in competitive/deckbuilding/extensive play buy Android Netrunner.

My only thematic complaint: it's a bit, not a credit. Also would it kill anyone to put a CRT monitor or two in the new art?

I haven't played this game enough... I really haven't. I've played probably three or four times so far, and I absolutely love it, and it's theme.

Great game, looking to put it back on the table soon!

Fantastic card game. My favourite LCG/CCG although I have not had much chance to play it as the community for it in my local area is small. I want to get rid of my collection (reluctantly) as I don't have anyone I could frequently play it with- that being said it is a fantastic game.

My one issue with the game is the thematic terminology is confusing to teach to new players.

What's good: Fun game, nice mechanics. You will have fun! 

What's bad: Where to begin with this? The biggest thing is money. This game really needs you, tempts you, begs you to spend money on it. It needs your money in order to be more fun, and then the fun just won't stop and it keeps going crazy and then eventually you have fun over to your house for dinner and it wants to borrow 30 bucks from you. And you know fun will never pay you back... or will it? So you give fun the money and then.... well, I hope you see my point. Some people say a LCG is better than a CCG on your pocketbook... and just because I'm not having to get a second job to pay for my hobby, doesn't mean I'm not eating hot pockets and oatmeal for dinner.

get ready to spend the money.

I dislike the game box being much too big for the few cards inside. And you are forced to buy the start box twice or even three times to really start into the deck building.

I know there is a big economical machinery behind this game, but why not giving all the cards in one start box?

I don't mind for the booster packs (I even appreciate knowing before buying and having every card 3 times in them).

I liked this one a lot more than I expected to – the meta-game, the feints, the tension of trying to get things done – they raise the game from merely playing powerful card combinations from pre-constructed decks to a bit of a poker match. The asymmetry of the sides is quite interesting and novel (one offense and one defense), and I’m sure able to hold one’s attention through the subsequent deck releases. 

However, this may be the best game that I don’t play, and that’s due to the commitment required. If I ever get a game-playing spouse, I may very well revisit this one as it seems to be a lifestyle game that requires regular, consistent play among equally skilled players.

Netrunner is a great game - it offers a great immersive experience in which you really feel like a «Corporation» or a «Runner». The designers made a great effort to translante emotion into mechanics. 

It's a complex game though. I'm only a beginner but I can see all the depths and complexity available for he who would want to plunge in. Be warned - the assymetric experience and the flexibility of the game makes for a steep learning curve. Once you know the game though, it's well-paced and full of bluffs and fear and what-not, in addition to heavy on strategics decision and ressources management.

It's also impossible to play any multiplayer games and I don't see any way to make any home-house rules to circumvent that.

My friend calls it deep; I think it's simply broad. There are lots of paths to watch, setup and/or avoid, which makes it a bit of a game of whack-a-mole with limited whacks. So, fun and good replay-ability, yes, but not deep.

Feb 2015
After many expansion pack releases the game is such that you can no longer prepare for every circumstance, so games are now officially a crapshoot. And I am in agreement with alexfrog about the game being far away from the spirit of the original with fast advance corp decks dominating. It's either fast advance or the perpetual minefield of Jinteki. The runner game has mostly become one of hammering the central servers. What's the point?

May 2015
I am done with this game. The game meta is a perpetually moving target that is a full-time job to keep up with (creating decks and playing *a lot*). Great if you're a teen or 20-something with nothing but free time, but as a 40-something I have neither the time nor patience for it any longer. I'll stick with the non-collectible Blue Moon to scratch the same itch.

Simply the best CCG/LCG/TCG (whatever you want to call it) that I have played since Magic: The Gathering.  It's as good as it is because it avoids the trap that many other games of it's kind fall into, in that it is unique and not derivative of Magic.  Probably because it was also designed by Garfield.

UPDATE: I have sold my Netrunner collection.  Not because I dislike the game, but because an inherent problem with competitive "collectible" games is that you really need the time to commit to them, as well as a dedicated group.  Unfortunately I have neither at this time.  But I still stand by my previous rating.

I must admit that much of the high rating I give to this game is due to its spectacular theme. More than just cyberpunk, it's amazingly great sci-fi: sometimes tongue-in-cheek social commentary, other times an exciting glimpse into the future.

Mechanically, it's no slouch either. I consider it an "economic warfare" game, where both players are focused on generating credits (or cards) and striking when their opponent's economy is weak. I also find the "trace" mechanic (essentially an auction) interesting because it boils down to how well both players can read the game state and translating that into how much they should pay.

Some complaints I have are the randomness of the HQ and R&D draws which can decide games, and of course needing opponents who are also into deckbuilding to fully enjoy it.

This has all the characteristics that most suit my gaming tastes: controlled risk, hidden information, opportunities for creativity and aggression, and thematic cohesion. Setup and play is fast. Art is beautiful. Each game is intellectually challenging, but also fun and tense from start to finish. Replayability is infinite, even discounting deck building.

JUL/13 On one hand, I'm so glad designers are trying new settings//themes for games. And this game is brilliant design well-suited to the theme. On the other hand, I hate the theme and it prevents me from getting into the game.

Dang.

FEB/14 The theme and jargon are growing on me, and the expansions are introducing art I connect to more strongly. This game is quickly growing on me.

MAR/14 I've lost something like 14 games of this in a row, but even aside from that, all my playings are starting to feel "same-y". I either don't understand the deckbuilding and/or don't understand it (and I've deckbuilt Magic for years). I took a look at the expansions cards for Corp, took a stab at deckbuilding, and felt no excitement at all to tool around.

I expect I'll buy the base game as a solid 2-player game, and leave it at that.

I think i have found the perfect 2-player game with lots of depth, ideal game length and logical/intuitive thinking balance. I love that, unlike many other games of the format, this game feels more boardgame-like, because with all the deckbuilding its still very important how you play during the game. The game is also full of interaction and thats a thing i like - being able to take risks when i feel the urge for it, bluff and mess with my opponent. But more important is that Netrunner is very flexible and does not restrict you to any particular playstyle, so if you like zero risk full control, you can play it that way. The deckbuilding aspect blurs these line even more as in Netrunner you have clear and simple parameters that interact in complex manner leaving you lots of intriguing  deckbuilding options and many many cards haunting your mind, begging you to make combos and new decks. Overall i am pretty sure this is a solid 10.
P.s. I fully acknowledge that the logic/intuition and strategy/luck ratio i call ideal is subjective, but do not make the mistake of many other reviewers who judge a d6 based on a single throw result, instead of a 100 throws. Same goes with card games and as such Netrunner as risk management lies in its soul and probability is whats important, not a couple of lucky draws.

Christmas gift 2012.  Been studying the rulebook, watching YouTube videos about it, and reading reviews and comments here on BGG.  This looks like an awesome game and I love the "Android Universe" from FFG.  Played first game against my wife 12/30/2012.  It was fun for both of us.  She won, as typical.  We took our time playing and learned that if you bide your time the other player gets stronger.

RATING: 8
Currently best card game I've played

Pros
-It's different than every other card game other there (not just: play as mage/general, draw, gain resource, summon monster, attack, cast spells/tactics, upkeep)
-Two different ways to play the game (Corp or Runner). Both play differently beyond just theme. They have different objectives, type of cards etc.
-Very flexible turn structure - a player can choose what they want to do (e.g. draw 4 cards, get $3 and draw 1 card, make 2 runs and purge a tag and install some equipment etc.)
-Consequently, luck of the draw feels less significant (you can just choose to draw more cards).
-Lots of approaches a player can take on any given turn (you can attack enemy servers, their hand, their discard pile, their deck, you can build up cards/money/equipment) --> lots of strategy and decision making
-LCG model, no random packs, always know what you're buying. Saves players money compared to CCG model.
-Game comes with a total of 7 different factions (at least 24 different match ups).
-Bluffing is not only possible, but an important element of the game
-Fairly straight forward deck building (or players can use pre-designed decks).
-Components are good, art is amazing.
-Excellent card design. Cards feel mostly balanced, very little power creep, , each card feels unique and fills a strategic niche and each faction continues to remain different.
-Short game length (~30mins). Little setup involved.

Cons
-Somewhat steep learning curve for non-card gamers. Lots of terminology (most obvious examples: a players deck is either called R&D or Stack depending on who you are...hard to remember stuff like this first time around)
-Large amount of cards available for purchase and growing --> big barrier for newer players, and card knowledge becomes very important.
-Very cutthroat play style is not for everyone
-Core set does not come with 3 copy of every card, nor does it come with enough cards to have 7 decks simultaneously (you always have to take out ~15 neutral cards to put into the deck you want to play)
-Some luck element (e.g. doing runs on R&D, in one game you may easily find and score all the agendas, while in another game you may find none).
-Very limited deck building out of box - Corporations MUST use the neutral agendas provided (to meet the requirements of a legal deck), there are no others to swap out
-2 players only
-Card game still dictated somewhat by luck
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I hate to say it, but this is actually a pretty innovative game. Not is it only asymmetric, but the goals of each side are far from the typical card-battle CCGs.

The Corporation knows almost everything, and builds (mostly) permanent defences in order to advance agendas; the Runner sets the pace of the game, probing and passing those defences in order to steal those agendas.

The flavour text is generally very weak - verbose and heavy-handed.

The templating/drafting is so terrible that it has spawned all sorts of unnecessary fiddly rules issues (eg Accelerated Diagnostics triggering card draw, or Caprice Nisei), and understanding timing windows is critical to playing the game properly (eg House of Knives after Komainu but not Psychic Field). Another issue with Netrunner is that much of the game is understanding what tricks an opponent can pull, making card memorisation very important.

(I own two core sets.)

First of all, i would like to thank
[user=pyjam][/user]
who introduced me into this game.

Wow, just wow ! I can't believe that such a thematic and well designed game exists. It must be a dream !

A cat and mouse game in a cyberpunk world, 2 asymmetric sides with differents goals and tools :

(1) - Corporation always play cards face down in servers protected by security programs (called ICE). His goal is to advance and score agenda (secrets projects), by luring and slowing down the runner. The corporation can try to locate the runner and tag him (find is MAC address) in order to inflict him brain or physical damage (lesser card in runner's hand). When the runner doesn't have any card in hand, he is considered flattened and lost the game.

(2) - Runner always play cards face up. They came with different types, from resources, hardware and programs to viruses. They consist of tools allowing the runner to be able to launch infiltration on the Corporation's servers in order to steal agenda or trash whatever the Corporation was developing. When the R&D deck is exhausted, the Corporation lose the game. 

The first player to seven points of agenda wins the game.

One of my most favorite card's artwork :

RATING: 4
Very difficult to learn, but also very appealing and compelling.  Then dispiriting and hard work.  Then enjoyable. I only get to play this over Skype so there's another barrier to overcome, and I don't think the bluffing aspect is coming out properly, but something about this game makes me want to play it, learn it, understand it.  I mostly enjoy it when playing, it feels like I could do so consistently. (7) 2015-07-06

____

6 months later I feel like this might be over, the game really offers nothing for the casual player and deck building is such a tedious and time-consuming chore that you have to be really invested in trying a particular card or strategy to want to go through with it.  More expansions mean more cards that will never see play, and the core set does not give enough to play the game properly.  I feel like the core set gestures at a game that would be enjoyable rather than being it.  Having run through the first 5 data packs there's now too many possibilities to remember to be able to guess what particular card my opponent is playing, and I'm just not invested in the outcome of the game.

Ultimately I think the asymmetrical nature works against me enjoying it, and so much is decided in the build before you play that one player can start with a huge advantage over the other with neither knowing it.  Cycling between different identities just seems to lead to waiting for a lucky draw between decks that can interact with each other, and the identities and asymmetry seem to act as a smokescreen for how unbalanced the game can be.  I'd much rather play a game where both players start in an equal position and the outcome is entirely determined by the play after the game has started. (6) 2015-12-23

______

Having not played since last comment, I can now no longer remember playing a game of this and enjoying it.  The game has too many problems and the play is not worth the preparation time.  I really doubt I will ever play it again. (4) 2016-03-17

RATING: 8
I really like this game a lot so far. Its asymmetrical nature is really appealing, and the different factions feel quite different while still sharing a number of key characteristics with each other. At first I was very disappointed by FFG's decision to include only one or two of certain cards in this core set because it feels like a play for more money. But now I think about it a different way:  players who are hardcore deck-tuners are essentially subsidizing my (and other casual players') purchases of the core set. They buy two or three, I buy one, and the overall price of the core set is a wee bit lower.

Yes, it absolutely would have been better had there been three of every card in the core set. No question.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
My first impressions of this 2-player LCG is very favorable - I can't wait to play with more of the decks!  It took a little longer to absorb the rules than I thought it would, but once the concepts are understood, it actually flows together pretty well and probably only takes about 20 minutes to explain to a newbie.  It was a very strong bluffing element, which may turn some people off, but if you like a tense 30-minute cat-and-mouse game that allows you to build up your strength and gives you all kinds of platforms from which to launch attacks and surprise your enemy - check this out.  The core set comes with plenty of game in it - it's complete enough by itself that buying additional packs is not necessary, although hard to resist.  This is just one cool game that I look forward to exploring for a long time.

RATING: 10
Awesome! A newer, better Netrunner.

My favorite card game and my second favorite tabletop game (the first being War of the Ring).

It's nice to see a customizable card game where most of the strategy lies in playing. Deck building is important too, but unlike many other customizable card games, don't expect your deck to run on autopilot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Got some immature customizable card game problems (card pool is too small, a few cards are much stronger than the field, and there are only a handful of competitive decks) but the core is strong. Tons of choices to make on a turn and plenty of ways to work yourself out of a bind. As long as they find a way to expand the design space without breaking the game this could be, with time, one of the greats.

Update: Upgraded to a solid 9. I like this more every time I play. Great distillation of limited information, calculated risk, and deck building.

My first ever LCG (or CCG even) game and I'm completely hooked. I like the theme and the fluff of the Android universe.

The asymmetry of the game is great. The bluffing, the double bluffs, the reading of players, the many options from the cards, the building up of you rig/servers. There is a lot to like. And I do.

And then comes the deckbuilding. As soon as you start mulling over the possibilities of card combinations then you know the game really has got it's hooks into you. I can spend many an uncomfortable tube journey thinking up janky combinations for my next Netrunner night.

This game has been a regular weekly fixture for a number of years now. We meet in a pub, have a few beers and a few games and I've made some new friends along the way.

2017 Update: I quit playing regularly. It's a "lifestyle" game and a time sink. Very fond memories of the my time with ANR but once you dip out, it's very difficult to keep up with how the game changes and develops. I've had the occasional game since. This makes it a difficult game to rate; it changes based on my commitment to the game as keeping up with the cards and combos was part of the draw. It's a little overwhelming if you dip out of a cycle or so and then the deckbuilding rules and MWL etc change. It's been as high as a 10 for me, but I think 8 is a good fit in retirement.

Just didn't work for me.  Randomly pulling cards from a players hand or hoping to burn the rights cards from the top of their deck seemed too luck based for me.  I understand there is a bluffing aspect to playing agendas to the board and blocking them with ice, but it all seemed way too slow and its not nearly as satisfying as, for example, hitting my opponent for 20 damage in a single turn.  Needlessly complex and has annoying terminology.  Not for me.  Also, its a living card game.  Meh.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
FFG have done a superb job with this relaunch. It's a complicated game to learn, however once learnt it's one of the best two player card games out there. I think you'll especially enjoy this if you have a technical job (e.g programmers, web-designers, server engineers). It's worth noting that the base set alone is a great experience and a self-contained game - you could play this for a long time and still have fun.

This game is very deep, and one of the most satisfying 2 player duel games I've ever played. TONS of replayability, and is a fantastic reboot of a classic game. Very glad to be able to deckbuild now that card availability is not an issue. Full disclosure: I am a playtester for the game (AND a computer professional, so the theme is a hit for me), but I wouldn't be so enthusiastic about it if it wasn't consuming my thoughts.  Highest of recommendations.

I love this game, but with the caveat that I play casually ie not in tournaments with constructed decks. I don't even buy the LCG packs.

RATING: 3
Pros:
- Nice artwork
- Interesting concept pitting two highly different opponents against each other

Cons:
- Far too luck-based for my tastes
- The runner is far more interesting to play than the corporation
- Deckbuilding is what makes the game interesting, but you need several expansions for that
- Money drain
- Annoying fanboys (though you cannot fault the game for that)

Conclusion: while the core idea behind the game is not bad, I don't want to play it as I would not be a match for those who know all the expansions by heart, and I do not want to invest money nor time in a game that was designed as a money drain. Were this game a one-time purchase (base game plus maybe 2 expansions in one box, and that's it), I might consider playing it. As it is, my first few plays sufficed for my final assessment: this is definitely not for me.

Not willing to state much of an opinion until I've actually played it more as these sorts of card games with deck construction don't lend themselves to first impressions.

Since tokens are used for paying cards that are accumulated separate from the actual decks, the resource system is not nearly as frustrating as other deck construction games. But I fear that assets\resources are sort of similar. Your economy really can be shot within a couple of turns and the wild asymmetry to the game makes analyzing play extremely difficult.

I'm not an LCG-kinda gamer and wasn't seeking out any inspiration to pursue a career in Netrunning, but I thought it was a worthwhile thing to do as a hobby gamer to play the best-rated LCG game out there: Android: Netrunner (or as I call it: 'Johnny Mnemonic: The Card Game'). As my gaming buddy said, it's great to have a semi-collectable card game out there where it isn't just all about "he who has the strongest monsters wins," and he's absolutely right. Netrunner is quite interesting as both sides play differently and the theme comes out through the mechanics. Players are rewarded by knowing the cards and anticipating good synergies. And it's a fairly tense game, though I was surprised that meeting the primary win condition can have a lot to do with what cards you pull. But it's obvious that the stronger player will win most games, though this luck factor doesn't make it a foregone conclusion. But you have to anticipate and control for that luck and not necessarily succumb to it; so again, I think there's enough in Netrunner to say it's not just a two-bit money sinkhole whose fanbase can't be readily explained like some Pokemon fad. I'm still not going to pursue this or any LCG game at the moment (maybe if I was there from the beginning my thoughts would have been different). But I can see the appeal and I can understand why the game has lasting power.

This is based on the original edition of Netrunner (Wizards of the Coast) from the 1990s.  An excellent set of rules for an asymmetric 2-player card game that simulate a conflict of Runner and the Corporation they are trying to steal data from.  Very good rules with little or no timing issues.  In this edition it is a Living Card Game, with fixed expansion sets rather than purely random decks.

Update: Ultimately the fact that this is an LCG killed it for me. I can't commit to a single game to the level needed to follow a CCG or LCG. The turning point came when I participated a mini-tournament after a few months not playing. I spent multiple rounds setting up something only to discover that I had misremembered a rule and what I was working towards wasn't actually a valid thing. It's the closest I've ever come to literally flipping a table. Instead I conceded and walked away to calm down.

I honestly doubt I'll ever play this game again, but could possibly be talked into it.

Original Review:
My favorite LCG (Living Card Game). I always liked the original CCG, but never got that into it, largely because it wasn't big in my area and I never owned many cards. 

The preconstructed decks seem to favor the runners, but now that we're finally getting into constructed decks, things seem to be evening out a bit. I'm looking forward to future "data packs."

great mechanics, love this game.
This is such a diverse game. You have two different ways of playing, and untill the last minute there is always uncertainty. Anyone can win! Anything can change the tide of the game. The bluff, the traps, the mental game. 
This is definitely one of the best games I've ever played in my life.

Love this game. My wife and I play pretty regularly. We still have only gotten one expansion (creation and control), which we haven't even used very much, and still find this game very addictive after quite a few plays. I also really like that it has everything for two players to start playing in the initial box, though I don't know if we'll be able to share all the cards when we get more Data Packs and finding other folks to play with.

After maybe a dozen of plays with the same wife, on same level of experience.

Plays can be full of tension. Interesting learning curve. Can be quick, frustrating. Like it. Like it a lot?

No game got as many plays in its first week of purchase from me and my partner - but this might also be due to friendly circumstances (holidays, and only this one game available).

Absolutely amazing living card game!! The asymmetrical style of play is something very new for me and very very interesting. It's also perhaps the best union of theme and mechanics I've ever seen a game. With regular expansions provided by FFG this game is bound to be around for a long time.

Only downside is like all LCGs once you tinker with the starter decks it becomes less easy to introduce new players to the game.

RATING: 10
Now here's a solid gold TCG done right. You play the deck, not the other way around, and you're limited only by your ability to out-think and out-maneuver your opponent - not by mana-screws or infinite loop combos and locks.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
With just the core set this is a 9, maybe a 10
With just the core and the first cycle of expansions, it's an 11, though the corp could probably do with a few extra economy cards.
After that, each expansion makes the game worse. Especially competitively, where it probably reached a 4-5 for me.

2018-01: After rotation and the release of the release of the new core set I think this is heading rapidly back in the right direction. 10 for the new core set / cache refresh, and 9 for standard competitions.

One of the best card games out there if you can commit to it. I haven't moved past owning 2 base sets, and likely never will unless someone lends me a deck. The game is simply too big for casual players, but in an ideal world I'd play this all the time. The mechanics work so well with the theme, and it's made me love asymmetrical games.

The game only loses a point because it can be very brain-burny, with some of the rules nuances being annoyingly complex.

This is the perfect game.  I love playing it in person for the bluffing aspect, but will settle for games on jinteki.net so I can test new deck ideas.

Fun game, but not fun to get to the table unless you have a group of friends that are also willing to make a $100 investment that continues to grow every month to stay competitive.  Loved it at start, now just too frustrated to play because I don't have any friends that will play with me at the level i would like.  Will probably sell it soon.  The cost and effort to play v fun ratio has killed this game for me.  Unless you invest heavily you just can't play with other experienced players, and if you have 1 or 2 expansions you can't have a fun match against a casual gamer with just the base.  Also frustrating that you eventually need more than one base.  Oh well, it was fun until the expansions came out.

RATING: 8
My rating is based on the game design itself rather than my own preference.  I really dig the mechanisms, flow of play and asymmetrical play.  However, I am not so hot on the ever shifting cards/updates.  This is largely due to my own personal likes/dislikes.  It seems like a really high maintenance game (but with high reward for those that enjoy that).  Just not what I am looking for and I have very little desire to play it myself. (I would probably give it a 6 or 6.5 based on my own lvl of play interest)

In short:  It isn't you Android Netrunner, it's me.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I think this game is perfect.  The base set isn't enough to do what you want to do with it, as you can't really deckbuild, which is where the game comes alive.

My biggest complaint about it is the investment it takes, and at this point in the life of the game, it's hard to get a new person into it.  So my rating is really reflective of gameplay and the options there.  

I don't know much about other LCGs, but the barrier to entry to play this at all seriously is pretty large, and that's my main complaint.  I hope to try to mess around with cube drafts and things like that for it, but I fear that not being able to get a stable of people involved will be the reason I don't end up playing it much.

Everything owned til Data and Destiny. At that point and farther on, the game had degenerated so much that I consider it borderline playable; the semi-erratas or semi-bans created just bigger problems and I'm not a fan of them, so I quit the game and agree with my friends to leave it at that to play casually among us. A pity for a game that started so brilliantly and at the same time brilliantly flawed by the Desperado console, the Astro Pilot agenda and, subsequently, Near Earth Hub, among others.

Great tutorial, easy to play, easy to teach, love the theme and artwork of the game, and im just itching for a chance to play as the runner and build my own deck (I've only played as the corporation so far. If you are in to LCG, this is one of the best of heard about as of yet! Give it a shot.)

Side note: not an easy game to pull out because of the wordy cards are intimidating to new players and deck set up takes time. Customization is only encouraged with experienced players, but none the less highly recommended.

This game was originally described to me as "Cerebral." Boy, is it ever. This game will bake your brain, especially with it's un-accessible manual that raises more questions than it answers. Just watch some You Tube videos. You'll get it eventually.
A sequel of sorts to "Magic:The Gathering," I don't think this is the bluffing game to replace poker that Dr. Richard Garfield was trying to create. But it's amazing, stunningly complex, and very rewarding. The bluffing is there, but it's more "bait" than "bluff."
I suggest you grow into it with a worthy opponent who is willing to keep pace with you game for game. Both of you will appreciate it even more as you hone your skills. But don't keep it to yourself. Once you have the concepts down, get out there and try it with other players. There's still enough luck involved that you could take down an experienced player in one match.
The balance between skill and luck is better demonstrated here in this game than any other I've played.
However, like "Magic," I fear Netrunner will eventually devolve into a game of specific "I win" decks, brandished by nerds with nothing better to do than think of every way possible to ruin your strategy and this game. It hasn't happened, yet. And maybe it never will, but take a chance and try it out before it becomes so evolved with expansion packs that you'll never catch up.

Nice asymmetric game, and it's great that they recognized that the CCG format does *not* work for a game with a tighter range of strategies. I'm not crazy about it being shoehorned into the Android universe, and especially not crazy about them introducing "colors" into the game like Magic's, but the lack of randomized boosters still makes this version of the game far superior.

RATING: 7
In the late 90's, Wizards of the Coast threatened to fire the designers of the then-recent Magic: The Gathering Urza block because the expansion 'power creep-ed' the entire game a couple of steps. The fallout gave way to the Masques Block, an overall weaker (pay no mind to Rishadan Port) block that allowed the developers time to conceptualize a healthier environment in the following blocks: Invasion and Odyssey (arguably some of the better expansions at that point in Magic's lifespan). So where does Netrunner fit in all of this?...

Netrunner began experiencing a power-creep with cards like D4v1d, NAPD Contract, Caprice Nisei, while already existing overpowered cards remained in the format (Breaking News, San San City Grid, Desperado, Clone Chip to name a few). Rather than address the problem with many of the base cards and either issue bans or errata, a 'Most Wanted List', which increased influence on a given card, was introduced as the balancing mechanism. In theory this could have addressed problems with the game, except that most of the cards appearing on the list continued to see competitive play in overpowered decks. Then, rather than scale back the design of potentially-overpowered cards, the designers introduced a slough of broken cards and assumed that they could balance the environment after-the-fact: 24/7 News Cycle, Global Food Initiative, Museum of History, Wireless Net Pavilion, Explode-a-Palooza, SYNC, Haarpsichord Studios, Faust, Marcus Batty.      

The result was a game that was more about 'cheating' agendas into your scoring area and fast advancing or, from the runner's vantage point, a game about avoiding all ice entirely in addition to multi-accessing. One of my friends won a tournament running a corp deck that contained only 6 ice, none of which actually ended the run. As the power of the cards grew, so did the supply of 'silver bullet' cards that served no purpose but to counter one card in competitive use, a clear sign of an unhealthy tournament environment. What was once a game where bad luck in accessing or bad draws were forgivable due to the relative balance of power level was now totally dependent on early game power plays and luck. Just go out and search for the distribution of runners and corps for a given tournament... you'll find that one corp is dominant (likely NBN) and one runner is mostly dominant (Anarchs) and one runner is hardly used (Criminals).

To add to this is frustration in the prospect of spending money on expansions that are poorly balanced. If you have all the money in the world, no problem. But many of the cards of late are either broken, silver bullets (competitive only), or unplayable (Jesminder, Laramy Fisk, I could go on and on about criminal cards here).

I enjoyed playing this game for years, but it's difficult to seriously consider playing again after looking at new card spoilers. At its peak, I'd rate Netrunner an 8 or 9.

Edit (9/18/2017): I just looked over Netrunner's latest revised edition of the Core Set, and I strongly approve. I probably would have removed Datasucker, Pop-up Window, and Diesel too, but they recognized a lot of the weaker and stronger cards, removing them in the process. The cards they've included in place of the more broken cards include some of the more fun and balanced cards they designed early on. This is a big step towards making Netrunner an enjoyable game again.

I know that this game is well regarded, but my wife and I couldn't get into the game.  Maybe the theme combined with the asymmetric element of the game didn't appeal to my wife.  Further, reading the manual was a slog and hurt the chances of the game hitting the table multiple times.

I like the theme, but since I game mainly with my wife and she doesn't like it, I can't rate this highly.

RATING: 8
I can't decide yet. Love the asymmetrical play. Annoyed by cards that I never want to play in the core set (solved by deckbuilding). Have had a couple of very frustrating plays where the game seemed to be decided on who got lucky enough to draw the Corp's agendas first.

Now that I have done some deckbuilding, I am afraid that the immense number of cards makes this game all about the Meta.  Which decks you bring to the table and which cards you pick for your deck have way too much bearing on the outcome.  So the game becomes a bit of a guessing game as you try to think about what you should include to stop what deck your opponent might build.  I think this can be fixed a bit by limiting which card sets you play with.  So, I'm done buying new cards.  But it means I can only play against others who do the same, or I will be in for some rude surprises and many silly losses.

RATING: 10
I feel this game deserves a two-part review, one from the perspective of the Core Set, and another as a competitive LCG:

- as a Core Set this game is fun, with 4 Corp and 3 Runner factions there are enough permutations to keep you interested for multiple games. The game is outstanding fun mechanically, however the Core set is really only the beginning, and will leave you wanting more ...

- speaking of 'more', as an LCG this has to be the best out there. The competitive scene is incredible fun with great support from FFG. The cost-barrier to entry is currently very very large and you'll be looking to spend roughly £200/$300 before you can be considered to have a competitive deck. I play this more than any other game I've ever owned though, and believe that it's totally worth it.

This is a good game that I don't particularly like, and my rating reflects preference rather than the quality of the game. The theme is well-implemented BUT I don't like the theme. The mechanics yield a deep play experience BUT they aren't mechanics I especially like (for example the resolution system versus ice reminds me of scrounging factors to get a column break in a wargame, never my favorite thing to do). The opening act of the game offers multiple paths to victory and opportunities to bluff/counter-bluff BUT I prefer games that spool up faster and begin at the point of impact. If you like the flavors that I dislike, then you will likely like this game (!).

Android: Netrunner appeals to the cyberpunk fanatic in me (bless you, Gibson), but the competitive, collectible nature of this game just doesn't fit with my meagre income (which is currently a whopping $0.00/hour). The game is fun, but unless I can get into it and start buying card packs soon, it will probably go up on the trading block.

Can't wait to put my hands on this one! 

UPDATE
It is irritating - as usual - that you have to buy three basic sets to get in the deckbuilding seriously. I'll try to get back in the previous incarnation of the game, or wait that the sets become cheaper. If they don't... well that will be a game I won't play this life. Too bad for FF.

UPDATE
I got the first game from a MT so I don't feel so bad to getting it, even with FF policy regarding cards number. 

That said, I played today and I found the game interesting (I tried just a couple of decks, so there is some replay value just out of the box), and I was left wanting to play more. So this is a very promising 7.6, with the possibility of increasing the rating.  

UPDATE
Ok, I'm playing this on the OCTGN and trying all the decks out. So far so good. This goes up to 7.8. 
For now I got good value for what I paid. This will likely go up again. 

UPDATE
Soaring up for me. This has gone to a neat "8". 

UPDATE
This game's one I'd want to play always. Getting to "9". 
Now I don't think it is going higher than this, because not all games I played were top exciting. Some were outright dull. Yet the quality of the cards, the setting and the mood still blow me away each time. 

UPDATE
This remains a "9", unfortunately FFG really fed me up with its policies. I don't want to buy 2 cores, and certainly I don't want to buy three.

I resisted this at first because of my bad first experiences with LCG's. Any game element which reduces a beloved character--Legolas, say-- and his sum of being to, basically, "8 strength points," is neither thematic nor distinguished mechanically.

But Android: Netrunner is fantastic! Why? Simply put, bluffing and asymmetry. I haven't heard anyone compare this to a two-person Cosmic Encounter before, but that's what it feels like (even if the mechanisms are completely different). Is it thematic? Ask instead, why is there, like, a dragon made out of LED's on every other ICE card? Who knows? Who cares? The theme is most expressively forwarded in the way the game plays.

Highly thematic. Not usually a fan of card games, but this one has piqued my interest due to it theme. I have one semi-regular adversary who kicks my ass nine ways to sunday every time. I have yet to grok it, but a good game overall.

Both my boys will play netrunner on occasion, which is a plus.  We all love playing the corporation. Setting traps and watching your opponent walk right in is delicious.  However, 'going on a run' as the hacker just feels like matching numbers.  I want to be captured and held in the Android universe for an hour or so but this process can bring me back to reality like the gaming equivalent of a flick on the ear during a daydream.  A game of two halves then!

A brilliant, a-symmetrical 2 player game.  The rules are pretty straightforward with all the complexity coming from the card combinations.  The main drawback is the limited cards in the main game, as you quickly find yourself wanting to add more and more.  There are a huge number of expansions, but the game can quickly become very expensive and you need at least a few friends to get the bug too for it all to be worth the investment.

Not sure what I think about this.  Probably easier to play if you start the game with someone who is also starting the game.  The "CCG" aspects of deck construction, and limit turn play are really minuses for me.  However, the radical assymetry of the players, and some of the very strong theme elements are definitely engaging.  Ultimately not for me, but willing to play other folks' copies.

This could end up being my favorite game, and probably already my favorite 2-player game. Truly the first good CCG/LCG that doesn't feel like a rehash of MtG.

When it came out I wasn't interested at all, but now that I've played it I'm completely addicted.

Also has one of the best use of themes in board/card games, the mechanics and terminology just gel perfectly with the cyberpunk genre.

Lots of depth, but not so much that it gets overwhelming. I really like the Game of Thrones card game in theory, but in practice there's so much card-specific text that you spend half your time studying your opponents cards. Netrunner strikes a better balance. Once you know the basic rules, the individual cards don't change the mechanics too dramatically.

Update: I just played four games in a row, and I was really impressed by how infrequently we needed to refer to the rulebook. And we never had to go scouring through FAQs or internet forums to answer timing questions like happens with other card games like this.

Got into this when I lived in AZ. Genuinely looked forward to our weekly organized play nights. I've been dying to find other Netrunner players near my current location. I like how you have to build an adequate deck for both runner and corp. The theme is PERFECT for a PvP card game. So much nail biting and close games. Just a genius design.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.2
A tremendous experience.  I enjoy both sides of the table.  Playing the Corp is tense, nervous, and full of difficult decisions on how to shore up defenses that are never quite strong enough.  I especially enjoy HB, even though I'm terrible at it, and Weyland, but Jinteki is fun too, and NBN is wonderfully thematic.  Playing the Runner is a more reckless, go-for-broke kind of experience.  I especially like playing the Anarchs (with their viruses) and the Criminals (with their back doors).  For me, those two decks do a great job of marrying the theme to the gameplay.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I love CCG/LCGs, but I can acknowledge some of the inherent weaknesses in the genre.  Often times it seems like the most important decisions happen while building the deck rather than playing, and poor card draw can literally leave a player helpless.

Perhaps the most important innovation of A:NR is that it is an LCG that doesn't play you.  Yes, deck building still matters, but deck enhance a set of abilities that every play has.  Each player has a number of "clicks" each turn which represent a sort of time economy.  A player can always spend a click to draw a card or gain a credit.  Of course, cards allow you to do things more efficiently, but this ensures that there is a game to play even when you are short on cards or haven't seen the right ones.

Clicks are also necessary to play any card from your hand, which makes your in game decisions matter much more.  Gone are those MTG moments when you empty your hand onto the battlefield.  Each card you play matters not just because of the money you have to spend on it, but also because of the time it takes to play that card.  Do you have time to play this card, or do you have to get aggressive now?  I wish more games had a system like this for regulating the tempo of the game.

I have said nothing about the bluffing aspect the game, but what is there to say that other players haven't?  Some people have expressed frustration about what this does to learning curve.  I've seen plenty of people walk away from this game grumbling about how either the corp or the runner is completely over-powered.  They hadn't figured out the game yet.  This game does take time to learn, but for an LCG that is a major perk.  If I'm going to invest in this game, I want know that I stand to grow with it.  That's what this game has to offer that is so exciting: I know how hard it is, so I know what it means when I see myself getting better.  Don't think of A:NR as a series of isolated games, the game is getting to know the game!

There is so much more I could say about A:NR, but I'll just leave it at this: A:NR is the best thing happening in analog gaming right now.  You have to try it!

(update) rating drop from 10 to 6 with the latest expansion releases.  playing the corp is now an exercise in futility.

A worthy succesor to Magic in my collection for a duel-type card game.

great theme, interesting play.

LCG is quite desirable over a collectable game, esp. once some more expansions come out.  Even with the core set, 4 corporations and 3 hackers make for alot of game play, just with the starter builds.  Factor in deckbuilding and the you get alot of a small box.

includes expansion What Lies Ahead, Trace Amount, Cyber Exodus, A Study in Static, Humanity's Shadow, Future Proof, Creation and Control, Opening Moves, Second Thoughts, Mala Tempora, True Colors, Fear and Loathing, Double Time, Honor and Profit, Order and Chaos, and card protectors.

This is like Crack printed on small cards. No Seriously, this is an amazing. I love the cyberpunk/near future setting and working in the IT field myself, this game just hit the right notes for me.

But despite the setting, the gameplay is great. Anyone can enjoy hours of entertainement with just the Core set without going into the monthly data packs and expansions. But if you love this game and play it often, you will want to buy some to add diversity after playing the core set decks so many times.

My only negative is that I wish I was playing this more often. Need to convince my friends to give this game a try.

This feels like one of the most overrated games on BGG. I've been a longtime fan of M:TG, and like the cyberpunk theme, so that combined with the high reviews gave me high hopes for this one, but I am let down. It feels rather flat, with much less variety and variability of strategies than it seemed like it would have had. Rather, the play seems rather formulaic and mechanical: 

if Corp {
  limit remote servers;
  put multiple layers of ice;
  use some dupe assets to fool Runner into trap;}

if Runner {
  collect lots of credits;
  make runs early and often;}

/game

It also feels imbalanced (in Runner's favor) -- is that my imagination?

I will give it a few more plays with different Corps and Runner factions, but... do I need to buy expansions to make this interesting?

It is a game where you want action efficiency, and that's about all there is to the game.

Have to play some more games, but it didn't blow me away. Looks good, but I don't like text-based games, as you can't just play it with people who don't know the game / cards. If you have a group who knows the game, it doesn't matter, but if you don't have such a group...

The game has way to many elements of luck, not knowing the hand cards, nor the cards on the table. Just a guessing game which I dislike.

The biggest pro for me with this game is how the game mechanics work. They're interesting, a bit different to most other things out there, and there's a strong match with the game and its theming... I'm a fan of the theme in general, and it's well implemented here. I like the asymmetric sides, which seem to be pretty well balanced, and overall it's certainly very well designed. However, out of the box, it's nowhere near deserving of the level of hype it gets. The variation between the decks is good, but the variation within the starter cards for each faction is pretty poor. You need to buy expansions with it to get anywhere near the most out of the game; without that it gets stale fairly quickly. Not as quickly as many other LCGs, and it's maybe more a flaw of the whole LCG genre than anything else, but I find myself more quickly losing interest in them than other game types (despite over the years being a big fan of card games).

The most tense, and probably the most thematic, card game I've played and a load of fun. Cyberpunk hacker themed, allowing for clever combo blending long-term strategy of your custom deck build, short term opportunism and a heavy dose of bluff and mind games it ticks nearly all the boxes for what I enjoy in a game. However it suffers from only 2 drawbacks. As a 'lifestyle' game it requires committing the time to regular play, continually keeping up to date with new cards and planning and assembling new decks of cards to experiment with in play. Which is sadly why I no longer play. It also only plays 2 and is definitely not for the conflict adverse.

Near perfect, even if it is pricey to stay current.  My only gripe is the MWL.  While I understand it is needed to maintain game balance, and to keep new decks competitive in tournament play, it makes deck building more complicated, always having to verify what cards have influence penalties.  I love this game, the MWL just raises the barrier for entry, making it harder to introduce to new players.

The game has interesting theme, suspense and room to play well. There is quite a lot of randomness and also quite a lot of skill involved, which should not surprise considering the designer. I honestly don't have very clear idea how to play well as Corp (and even less as Runner).

I don't remember playing a game as asymmetrical as A:N. Unique is a good word to describe this game.

Played this game a LOT with the wife at first. Mostly just played with the starter decks. Bought a few data packs and tried to dabble in deck-building but with no time for any play other than with the wife (who wasn't so much into customising decks) it got replaced.

EDIT (Feb 2016): I've started attending more regularly at a FLGS and I've been convinced to step back into the Netrunner scene. Let's see how it goes.

A relatively new game, that I've played quite a few times already anyway. I think this might be the thing I've been looking for when it comes to card games: Ample building of decks, lots of strategy and possibilities, no money sink, brilliant game system. A winner.

I enjoyed the original and while purists may bemoan some of Fantasy Flight's changes, this version really clicks for me. Gone is the vile specter of collectibility, and since deck building is an afterthought for me in this case, I'm pretty thrilled with the core set. If you're on the fence, don't feel like you have to buy lots of cards. You can have many, many hours of fun with the 7 pre-made decks in this collection.

Android: Netrunner has sold me on LCGs.  I have a hard time ever thinking about playing another booster pack based card game again.  

Netrunner is a brilliant game that really chews at a player's brain.  The smallest clerical error in counting credits or cards can result in a loss or a victory.  This shows how delicately, yet expertly, balanced the game is.

And when it comes down to it, the game is all math driven under the hood but it throws a layer of player skill (in bluffing and deception) on top that makes the game a superb competitive offering where player skill really shines over the "variance" aspect of other card games.

The greatest feature is the asymmetrical design of a Runner vs a Corporation.  Each player is playing a completely different game while battling for the same end goal (and the caveat that the runner can lose based on damage).

There is a lot going for this game and the base set is clearly one of the strongest sets.  In fact for those not interested in the competitive scene there is hundreds of hours of play to have in the base set alone.

This is the card game of the future folks.

Stopped playing, partly to the rather anti-social deckbuilding aspect (you're sitting by yourself a lot) and partly because i felt the noise-virus-trash-r&d-deck was overpowered.. no corporation i played against had a chance.

Man is this addictive..! Imho this game has some huge advantages over MtG:
Bluffing is a major part of the game, and that's great, MtG is pretty much in your face all the time.
Asymmetry, playing the hacker or the corporate is hugely different.
Theming, whereas in MtG you hurl spells at each other, A:NR is much richer in theme.. every mechanic, every cardpile, every action makes thematic sense. And that is awesome.

Now the negatives:
I would have liked the Mage Wars mechanic of choosing the card you would like to play, instead of drawing randomly.
I don't like the thousand expansions.. this is becoming magic the gathering sci-fi.. and I don't like money-sinks.

This is a fun LCG with asymmetrical play, featuring one player as the Corporation and one as a hacker. The sheer number of expansions out, makes this a daunting game for new players to get involved with. Also at this point, only removing one cycle from rotation, does not seem adequate.

A game of territory, of secrecy, and of many cat and mouse chases. There really is no other way to describe Android: Netrunner, as both players will be playing a game of territory with each other, with one player hiding his cards while the other tries to capture them. In Netrunner, one player plays a futuristic corporation trying to protect themselves against a group of people called Runners, while the other player plays as the Runner, trying to hack their way through to stop the corporation. Netrunner makes for a great game to play over and over because it is asymmetric: the Runner plays by different rules than the corporation, but I will talk about that later.
Premise:
Netrunner takes place in a futuristic society ruled by various corporations and technology. Seeing the effect computer technology has had on our society, transforming it in various ways, really makes Netrunner seem plausible. The game originally came out in 1996 as Netrunner (not Android: Netrunner), designed by Richard Garfield, the creator of Magic: the Gathering. It was a time before computer technology really took its grasp on society, before social media and smart phones, so for Garfield to have created this world full of technology taking over people’s lives really was an incredible vision. Eventually the game was picked up by Fantasy Flight, and added to their Android universe. In addition, the game went from being a traditional trading card game, where the player had to buy packs of cards to build their deck, to simply a card game, creating a set that had all of the base cards in it with multiple factions to play as for each side.
Both players can choose a faction from four Corporation factions and three Runner factions. Each faction has their own specific cards and special abilities. Once the player chooses which faction they want to play as, they can start building their deck. For beginners, it’s probably a good idea to simply use your faction’s cards and the miscellaneous cards that every faction can use. Learning the game will take a few plays as there are a good number of rules; it can be confusing and overwhelming at first. Don’t let that stop you as the game is fun once you get the hang of it.
Each player has a certain number of clicks, which are like moves in a turn. What the Corporation can do using their clicks is a little different than what the Runner does. The Corporation needs to focus on a more defensive battle. Use Ice (defensive cards) to protect your R&D, Headquarters, and Archives (deck, hand, and discard pile respectively). You also need to build remote servers and protect them. The Runner’s job is to make runs on the Corporation’s servers, whether they are remote servers or Central servers (R&D, HQ, and Archives). Think of runs like hacking a system. The game is literally about computer and software hacking.
The goal of the game is to score Agendas. How you go about doing that is where the game gets interesting. The Corporation installs Agendas in remote servers and spends turns advancing them. If he advances them enough, he gains that Agenda (such as a private security force). The Runner can score Agendas by making successful runs on a remote server where an Agenda is installed. 
A Game of Strategy
This is where the cat and mouse games come in. Throughout the game, the Runner needs to constantly be thinking about the next run, trying to make sure it is as successful as possible. He needs to install Icebreakers to break through the Corporation’s defenses. He needs to install protection to make sure he doesn’t get hurt if he does. He needs to gain money to help pay for breaking through everything.
Meanwhile the Corporation has a little bit more on his mind. He needs to plan ahead so that when he installs an Agenda, it doesn’t get run on and stolen. He needs to plan his defenses. The Corporation gets fewer clicks per turn than the Runner, so he needs to use his time wisely. He needs money to pay for defenses and Agendas. He needs to install and protect his assets so that the Runner doesn’t destroy them.
I called the game a game of territory at one point, and playing through, it’s easy to see so. The Corporation creates all of these servers with various protections. The Corporation is playing a very defensive game of King of the Hill, trying to make sure the Runner never gets through his defenses and onto his servers. At the same time, the Runner is playing Capture the Flag, trying to get the assets and Agendas installed on the servers.
The strategies each player employs really comes through with their decks. Some Corporation factions are more geared toward running the Runner dry, keeping his money low, having him struggling to build. Other factions are geared toward trickery, laying down traps in their servers. The Runner can try to brute force his way through the servers early or try to wait until late in the game, if he can survive that long.
There are many different ways of playing, depending on the deck you build, letting the player coming back, trying to new strategies against even the same opponent. It makes the replayability very high.
 Overall
This is definitely a must-have game if you like strategy games. Fantasy Flight does a fantastic job at creating this universe and immersing the player. There is tons of reason to keep playing the game, even if you only play against one person as you both can keep changing things up, building new decks, employing new strategies. Plus, it’s always fun to try and get into another person’s head.

Had this on my shelf for a few years. Well worth the wait. Netrunner is a difficult, subtle game. You don't generally have a ton of options on your turn, but how you use the ones you have is very important. This game is tense because every action counts and you need to pick a strategy. Choosing one can be murky and difficult though and often comes down to reading your opponent. Very interesting and want to play more

This game is quickly becoming my no.1 favorite game of all time, all games considered, not just card games.

You wouldn't believe the amount of theme a card game like this could have. It's mind blowing. My mind = blown.

It's hard to explain but everything you do "makes sense" and feels like you're doing what you're doing. A "job" card feels like a job because after playing it on the table you can start spending precious time going to work, time that you could use for other things, just to earn some money. Or.. I dunno, Wyldside, which is a seedy Nightclub card. Once you play it your runner starts spending time there. Sure enough he makes contacts, gains resources, and learns new tricks BUT you can't choose to stop going there. You're addicted! It's Brilliant!

And each new Data Pack just makes me giddy like a school girl. The game is getting better and better. I'm so hooked!

After reading the rules and following the forums for a few months, I like the concept and asymetrical gameplay.  Finally, a game that plays differently than MtG/WhI.  I hope that the bluffing aspect of the game will be strong enough to influence the experience.  

I am a bit concerned about the number of cards that sit on the table (meaning how much you need to remember to play effectivelly and still enjoy the experience) and the constant calculations (hopefully it is nothing close to Thunderstone, which seemed like an exercise in Maths).  It will all be clear in about a month when the games hits the shelves. 

Update.  Fortunately, my early fears about similarities with Thunderstone were totally wrong.  Netrunner plays smoothly and presents the players with many decisions.  The games played with the same decks unfold differently based on the initial decisions...

Though I've only played twice this year, I've actually played many, many times over the past 3 or 4 years. I love the tension and how immersive the game is, and the bluffing and mind games are a lot of fun. While I love playing the game itself, I'm not a huge fan of building/tweaking the deck beforehand, and that's largely what's kept it from getting to the table. I have the base set and a lot of the data packs and expansions. I'm bored with my current deck and want to build a new one before playing again...but...so many cards...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Most CCG/LCGs are based on bringing cards into play and attacking and defending with them. I like Netrunner very much because it plays very different to this formula.

One player (the Runner) accesses cards on some servers trying to steal the other player's agendas, while the other player (the Corp) secures the servers with ICE cards, and builds new servers to advance his agendas and to play additional assets.

It doesn't feel as attacking or defending, but as intrusion and counter-intrusion. The Runner searches for vulnerabilities to exploit and the Corp looks to make every intrusion as difficult as possible. Gameplay feels super thematic. The artwork and the cyberpunk background fits perfectly.

Some minor flaws prevent this game from reaching perfection: the first turns are too luck dependant, and you need many plays to learn to play properly.

This was actually my introduction to table top board gaming. Ruben and I used to play Magic the Gathering, but the sheer expense and commitment that hobby required deterred both of us. So I started looking for games that were similar, but more manageable. I found out Netrunner was designed by the same game designer as MtG, and I was sold! 

It took us a LONG time to figure this game out. I can't really speak intelligently as to the quality of this game, because our first time playing it felt fairly clunky. I did like the theme (cyber punk dystopia? yes plz), and I hope to play it again. However, this isn't a game that's really easy to sit down and learn. Once we have the rules down I think Netrunner will provide us with a game that has a high challenge level but reasonable play time. But until then, we don't really have the time to sit down and learn it!

It's a great game but.....

As the game grows, it becomes harder to get it to the table if I'm not playing against someone who is keeping up with the new Data Packs; and teaching it to new people without extensive card sorting and deck re-hauling has become effectively impossible.

That said, this is a fantastic game, with fantastic mechanics. The asymmetry of the play styles is inspired, and the slight psychological/bluffing factor opens up tactics that wouldn't be possible in other games.

Great versus other hardcore fans if you have the Data Packs, but still great with new people if you're only using the Core Set. As a matter of fact, if you care enough, I would almost recommend getting a Core Set for the sole purpose of playing with new people.

good game, but takes a lot of strategy starting with building the deck.  I am in love with deck builders and was hoping this was one, but it is a card game where you build a deck before playing.  The core set gets repetitive.  So unless you plan on buying expansions skip this one.

It's been over 3 years since I've played this game, but it's still my second most played game. I really enjoy creating the decks. Bluffing and trying to figure out when your opponent is bluffing is a lot of fun. My wife didn't really like the game, and I think my brother burned out on it, but I'm hoping that I can find someone to play it with again someday.

Un juego asimétrico donde los dos roles se juegan de manera muy distinta. Gran componente de faroleo, dado que la corporación construye defensas ocultas y trata de anotar puntos desarrollando sus planes, mientras que el runner las ataca para desarticularlas. Me gusta la sensación de evaluar riesgos, farolear, tomar riesgos e incluso hacer locuras y que no puedas ganar si sólo te mantienes en tu zona segura "tortugueando" PROS Mucho tema, buen trabajo artístico. Las condiciones de victoria tienen sentido. Metajuego: preparar el mazo antes de jugar. El juego base es más que suficiente para jugadores casuales. El tema es más atrayente que el de 1936 Guerra Civil y puede que vea más mesa. CONS: Poca variedad para la construcción de mazos. *Necesitas* expansiones para saborear bien este aspecto del juego. El tema se ha tomado tan en serio que hay que aprender jerga ("empuñadura", "I+D", "Archivos", "Servidores"...) Gran diferencia entre jugadores experimentados y novatos. Ideas de un juego de 36€ que al final, cuestan mucho más. Problemas de aleatoriedad. En NETO: un runner roba cartas boca abajo (ocultas)a la corporación deseando no coger la equivocada. 

Salvando las distancias, el tema y el faroleo, tema y el aspecto de Living Card Games, 1936 Guerra Civil me atrae más como juego de cartas a 2 personas. Es más barato, aunque más arduo, lo reconozco.

If you can deal with the needlessly dense and confusing language the game uses and the standard issue FF mess of a rulebook there seems to be a moderately interesting game to be had.  The game seems deliberately designed to force both players to make risky moves out of necessity - if the Runner plays it safe he will certainly lose, so the only option is to take risky gambles in order to force the Corp to stretch its resources.  Only played one learning game so there was nothing one could reasonably call strategy involved, but I can see how two experienced players can make it a good game.

It was a ding and dent: the box has a dime sized hole from the edge of another box, but the contents were in perfect condition when I got it.  It has now been played some, but wasn't my thing.

Woefully, this is very hard to learn. ICE Breaker and ICE have very abstract Images that are hard to remember, and you will need a lot of games to feel comfortable playing this.

If you do, you are rewarded with hands down one of the best games for two players. Every turn is full of meaningful decisions, the Theme comes together (again, at the expense of learning the game - calling the Draw Deck "Research and Development", the Cards in your Hand "Headquarters" and the Discarded Cards "Archives" make it harder to teach, because the terminology is important, as with any card game). I can only advise to seek out a local community and take the extra effort to learn this game. You won't regret it.

One of the greatest card games of all time. The play is everything I want in a game: Flavorful, strategic, creative, and interactive. Only problem is it seems to only get worse with time. Expansions/data packs at first are exciting and add design space but by now the game is no longer about its core ideas. There's a reason the nickname for its current state is "notrunner"

RATING: 9
I didn't trust the hype and no one from my regular game group is really into CCG-style games. That's why it took me a while to pick up this gem. Tom Vasel's review finally tipped the balance.

I have only played a couple of games, but I already know that it is here to stay on my shelf.
I love the bluffing part and enjoy the different factions.

Netrunner is probably the best collectible/living/customizable/whatever card game to date. It is the best of this genre to have made the actual playing portion of the card game be driven by more than just a well-built deck; Netrunner manages to reward players' in-game skills as well.
Combine this feat with an outright uncanny show of masterful game design and you have a winning formula.

Whew! What to say about Netrunner? It's a very interesting card game. You may play an evil corporation, secretly pushing your own agendas and bluffing your way to victory...or you may play a hacker attempting to manage your risks and uncover the corporation's agendas.

The real beauty of Netrunner comes in the deckbuilding. It's a game of statistics, resource management, bluffing, and risk management. You almost have to play it a few times to really understand.

It's a great game, but the base set only offers a taste. You'll want many more cards to get the full experience.

Eh...it's fun to an extent but I find that I'm not really interested in the meta game.  When I would just play against my girlfriend we had fun, frustrating and argument-inducing though it may have been. Once I started playing other people, the fun was slowly drained out of it. Yes, partly that's because I so far suck at deck construction and I'm not willing to put more time/effort into improving. But still, my overall enjoyment is diminished for it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I always have fun playing this game, even if I get creamed.
It's almost pure strategy, with a bit of luck for the runner when he runs on the central servers. This feels less like luck and more like calculated risk, and deckbuilding can increase your likelihood of hitting those agendas.
There are a million different deck types for both sides, and even with just the core set, you can make some pretty distinct decks.
I love it.

This is a solid asymmetric game that gives both players a fair chance at winning. The card packs that FF comes out with on a monthly basis are not essential but do provide more options for deck building and a higher difficulty which is well suited for the advanced player.
All in all, a strong game that will stay in my collection.

One of the best 2 player card games ever created. Brilliantly designed cards with beautiful art that all strongly evoke the cyberpunk theme. The bluffing mechanics and the economy both work really well and the LCG expansion method stops the game becoming exorbitantly expensive as with MTG.

OWNED SINCE 2013
Just a great game. It is fun, short, and at the same time you are engaged, involved, and you are putting serious thought about what you are doing. It has a very different feel to it then any other card game I own. I just love that it is a FFG LCG because I like knowing that if I stop buying, I have a complete set of the cards I already have. I hated playing Magic or Pokemon and having cards I can't use because I never "got" the rest of the set. This was my the first LCG I bought, and I ended up buying others afterwards. Play online only since I cna't find anyone to play with at home (but own the hard copy, too).

I've been an MTG Player for many years, while I still think that's the best game out there, this one has the same enjoyment in deckbuilding and card variety while being much cheaper.

Do not play unless you're willing to have all expansions, it's a LCG and lives with it. 

I stopped following the game in 2017 after the cycle rotation, this doesn't prevent me to say that it's the best LCG I've ever played.

(2012-12) Fantastic asymmetrical two-player game. Love the deckbuilding, love the influence restrictions.

(2014-12) I haven't touched my cards in months. Overwhelmed by the sheer number of cards available and irritated by the small number of dominant deck archetypes (and that the corp one involves low runner interaction). Still a good game, I think, but not for me anymore.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Before playing Android: Netrunner, I did not think it was a game that I would enjoy given that I had no experience with LCGs or CCGs and had no interest in deckbuilding or the card tournament scene.  But, after reading countless  reviews and being intrigued by the prospect of a deeply thematic two-player strategy game that my wife and I could learn and play together, I picked-up a copy of the core set.  Now, after logging multiple plays, I can say that I really, really enjoy this game.  So much so that we've purchased all of the expansions and have been incorporating the new cards into our decks - which turns out to be a lot more fun than I thought it would be.  A:NR has become my wife and I's go-to game in the evenings - it is a quick-playing, interactive, deep, strategic game that is not growing stale.  I really cannot find anything to dislike.  10 out of 10.

I've only played with the pre-constructed decks, so you could argue that I've missed a big part of the actual game. Asymmetry is an interesting mechanic to me but it doesn't seem to be super balanced, at least with the pre-constructed decks in the base set. In our experience the runner is more likely to win, and some cursory google searching has revealed that we aren't alone in that. It seems like if you wait too long as the corporation the runner will have such a strong setup that they can plow through even your really powerful ICEs, but then early you need the right one or two ICEs to protect your cards. And as the corporation your ICEs apply to a single spot, where the runner can have all their stuff apply to whichever column they happen to be attacking at the time.

love the game, best 2 player card game I've played.

The luck of card draw that plagues LCG/CCG's is somewhat mitigated by bluffing, and cards that allow you to dig for other cards that you need.

Needs to be played between players who put the same amount of investment into the game, eg. no point in someone who does a lot of deckbuilding playing against someone who just uses the same decks every game. Or someone with only the first few expansions and no knowledge of other cards vs someone who has everything (not having all the expansions isn't necessarily a disadvantage, but lack of card knowledge and therefore the ability to deckbuild properly is).

Unfortunately the rate at which new cards are released has caused the card pool to get to a silly size, and resulted in a significant barrier to entry for new players.

This comment will read almost identically to my thoughts on the Game of Thrones card game: the barrier to entry for new players is REALLY high (it'll take three games just to digest the rules, and another three to get a feel for the basic cut-and-thrust going on; THEN you can start playing, but by that time, most folks have quit.)

But if you can get over that hurdle, it's a phenomenal two player card game.  The deckbuilding element is better in AGOT, the in-game experience is less of a brainburner and more of a bluffing game in Netrunner.  The base set here is better than the AGOT core set, so if you're just going to buy one $30 box, stick with this.

RATING: 5
The theme is great (the mechanics reflect it so well) and the bluffing and luck-pushing elements make the game very tense. Though the elements of luck can sometimes get a bit out of hand, it is tolerable (I find that there is as much luck as there is luck management and that a skilled player can usually turn a bad hand into a series of smart plays).

The main problem is that the gameplay isn't smooth. Part of this comes from the use of the Living Card Game model. While I prefer it to the Collectible Card Game model for monetary reasons, a design that allows for constant expansion usually results in mechanics that are fidgety and filled with edge cases. I can't count the number of times I have attempted a strategy only to have it pointed out that one word on a card has a slightly different meaning than I thought it did.

That combined with getting a late start into the game's ecosystem (it isn't much fun playing against those who have been playing since day one and have access and familiarity with many of the prevailing strategies) means that I might keep what I have for some casual play, but I'm not going to try and catch up with players who have been invested since the beginning.

I played the original, which was pretty broken and fun. The new version has obviously gone through more play testing and balancing, and it's still fun. 

The core decks seemed to play just fine against each other, although a couple of core sets are going to be required for any kind of competitive build. 

I've been out of the game for a while, and was discussing power creep with an avid player. His take is that the cards are not getting stronger on average, but rather that more options have been opened. I'm strongly considering a return to the casual/competitive scene, and will have more to say about balance afterwards.

We are really enjoying this card game. It is so unique and plenty of fun. 2 completely different sides to play and many choices to make. I am really impressed how my son has grasped this game and the amount of fun we have had with it so far.

It is one of those games that even when you lose you love it and want to replay again right away.

I really do enjoy this game.  The asymmetrical gameplay makes for a very unique experience with either side.  The various corporations and runners are very different in strategy as well, so there is some more chance for deck-building and strategy.  I only have the base set and would love to see what the expansions have to offer.  Overall, a great card game.  A little difficult to get used to the lingo, but you can always watch the Fantasy Flight tutorials, which are excellent.

Randomness figures heavily in this game, but it doesn't detract from the fun.

I find the constructed adolescent-style slang terminology in the rules to be a bit irritating. It's like: Wow, they're using different words for things that already have good words to describe them, so this *must* must be a cool game. [rolls eyes] Suddenly I want to say this: Thank you, all the other game designers, for not doing this.

Yeah, I know, it's supposed to add to the theme.

Interesting mechanisms, but I haven't played it enough to get a feel for where it will end up on my rating scale.  The thematic descriptions of all the different elements (e.g. R&D, HQ instead of deck, hand) seems needlessly obfuscated, but I guess you get used to it.

Hackers vs corps. More like a game of poker than anything sometimes.

Biggest annoyance is the cards in the core set that are only 1 and 2 of that require you to purchase additional core sets in order to complete a playset.

By now the game has an absolute ton of expansions which can seem daunting but the core set experience is still a decent one for learning the game. The big box expansions are the ones that add quite a bit of content to the game and are probably the first to pick up if you want to continue.

I've never played LCGs, CCGs, TCGs ... anything. I have a few friends that play MtG, but I've never even really watched them play.

Point being: I am the furthest from knowledgeable about card games as anyone can be. However, I took it upon myself to find a card game that my girlfriend and I could occasionally play.

Being a big FFG fan (and the fact that this site rated Android Netrunner so highly) I figured I'd give it a go. As of writing this, I have only played one game, but it was VERY fun. There was a bit of a learning curve (at least for me), but once crossed, it was pretty straight-forward. The systems seem to offer a good deal of possibility for various strategies and I've already recognized that I will need to identify opposing strategies moving forward and build my deck with options to counter them (Icebreaker buff cards, I'm looking at you). I'm curious how long the core set will last me before I need to expand, but hopefully I'll be good for a while.

But yeah, very fun game. I'd definitely recommend, even if (or possibly in spite of the fact that) you're like me who is totally new to games like this.

I really like this game for a number for reasons:

1) The asymmetrical nature of the game.  It is one of the few games that manages to do asymmetry in a way that feels balanced and interesting for both sides.

2) The hidden information.  It's amazing how quickly a "run" can turn around when a big ice is revealed, or how fast a whole game can be won or lost when the runner hits a particularly nasty trap.  This, combined with the scarcity of cards to reveal hidden information (so far) keeps the runner on his toes and helps maintain the balance.

3) The fact that strategy and bluffing are more important than luck.  Because you have the ability to take actions to shore up areas where you are weak, drawing cards to search for that key icebreaker, or taking bits when your bit engines are exhausted, you can exert more control in a game where luck isn't coming through.  And while you may still end up in a situation where you never draw your key icebreaker or any bit engines at all, it doesn't feel quite as powerless as being "mana screwed" in MtG.  You can always do something to control your situation.

At last I got to play this. A friend explained Netrunner to us, however, to be honest we didn’t understood all the rules and interactions so I won’t rate the game at this point. It seems I would like the game but I feel the game has a steep learning curve.

Next step: Read the rules.

The rules are read, there were many things we didn’t get in our first play, the most damaging one was that I was breaking all the Ice`s routines with one action of my icebreakers :S. I’m ready to give it a new try, now I only need a willing opponent.

After a couple more games, I’m beginning to see why this has gone up so quickly on the BGG ratings (it is currently number 6). I have only played as the Hacker, but now I want to play more. For me the game has a lot to offer, each faction plays differently and I feel the game is very deep with hard decisions EACH TURN which is what I want in my preferred games. Also the play time is under 1 hour and many times half that time. 

I love the asymmetric play, I wish more card games were like this. The rules are a bit involved but not overly complex. Explaining the game can be long because you have to teach both sides, however I really like the gameplay and bluffing required (by the corporation) to win. I’m amazed (and a little embarrassed) that I have never even heard of Netrunner before FFG picked up the game.

As is usual with FFG, the cards and components are top quality, I specially dig the cyberpunk art, it is great and conveys the theme perfectly :thumbsup:. In general I’m not interested (much) in the deck building facet, but I appreciate it is there if I need it (from time to time I DO delve in this), also I know this is one the main selling points for Netrunner. What I used to do with MtG (and I plan to do with AN and Mage Wars) is to look up on the internet some cool decks to play with :D.

Currently, I´m trying desperately to promote this game (and Mage Wars) among my friends and game groups so we can all evolve together and get lots and lots of plays.

Bottom line, Android: Netrunner is a wonderful 2 player game which I want to explore it further and it has the potential to go up in my ratings. I’m very excited about this one, already pre ordered the expansion packs and I want to play (at least once) the original game.

Netrunner has sucked me deep enough that I want to try my hand at some deckbuilding, I didn’t had this urge since I abandoned MtG years ago. I think I like deckbuilding in Netrunner because the options are not limitless, you have influence points to spend so I feel it is not that consuming time wise.

I’m thoroughly enjoying all my Android: Netrunner games. I feel that winning with the runner is easier but I’m liking the game more and more. My favorite runner so far is Noise and my favorite Corp is NBC.

I’m upgrading its rating to denote my new feelings toward the game. I already built some decks and I can’t wait to test them, fortunately I have promoted this game among many friends so I won’t lack an opponent.

Great game. I’m already committed to buy all the game coming expansions, right now I have the four data packs that FFG released.

This game definitely will enter my top ten of favorite games. Now I want to always play it and I’m also building decks for it. So far it seems the runner is much more powerful that the corporations, I always win when I play the runner and I almost always lose when I play a corporation, however I enjoy more the game when I’m playing with the corp. I suck at it but I enjoy it. So far only my GF has fallen for my traps when I’m playing with the corp. It seems I need to improve my bluffing skills.

From now on I will always play at least 2 games with the same person, one with a runner and another with a corp, that is, I will follow the tournament rules even though I won’t ever participate in a tournament. 

On the other hand I’m very disappointed that I cannot build the decks I want because the core game doesn’t have 3 copies of each card, the worst offender (so far) are the Desperado console and Ice Carver. I need more copies of those cards but I don’t have them and I have bought everything Netrunner so far :angry:. I won’t buy another core set just for these cards and even if I did, I still would not have the complete 3 set :angry::angry::angry:.

I still love Android: Netrunner, but as the game continues to expand, many friends stopped playing it. All of us play causal so getting the game to the table has been harder and harder. Android: Netrunner is certainly a lifestyle game. You need to spend a lot of time creating and tweaking your decks and the meta game changes a lot with each expansion they release. I still think it is a tremendous game and I still buy every expansion FFG releases, but I no longer deckbuild my decks. With the new expansions, creating a new deck isn’t as easy as was before. Now you have a plethora of options so I’m going back to my previous custom and I look the best decks online. I won’t do any more deckbuilding, it consumes way too much time. Another bad thing about this, is that new players feel overwhelmed when faced with all the cards the game now offers, so finding new opponents hasn’t been easy.

In general, if a game is a reprint of another, it isn’t eligible to participate in my lists of top ten favorite games by year. Android: Netrunner is eligible to participate because it seems FFG improved the game a lot with the new edition (added lots of cards and identities) and I still haven’t played the old edition. If I do I will come back to rethink this point.

This past year I almost didn’t play any game of Android: Netrunner. I still think it is a tremendous game, but getting it to the table these days is next to impossible. I think I will stop buying expansions for it. Also my desire to play it again isn’t as high as before, now, building the decks is more of a chore than a joy. Due to all of this I’m downgrading its rating. I’m still open to play Android: Netrunner casually, but I almost always prefer to play an Euro game now.

Netrunner deserves the hype, packing many interesting confrontations into a short amount of time, and that's just playing with beginner decks.  Deckbuilding and expansions give Netrunner the possibility of becoming a lifestyle game.

Best. Game. Ever.

Elaboration: Android: Netrunner is a customisable card game that sees players facing off against each other in the classic cyberpunk trope Corporation vs. Hacker. The game is asymmetrical, with each player using completely different cards and methods to score points. The theme of the game ties in very well with the gameplay. The monthly expansion packs provide players with more options and play styles.

I highly recommend Android: Netrunner. However, it does requires a fair bit of investment (time, money and knowledge) as well as a network of players for it to truly shine.

Myself being a - used to be - 'devotee' to MtG, this one intrigued me quite a bit. Asymmetrical game play with very interesting theme. And I don't have to spend a fortune to make a competitive deck? I would love to try this out.

Being a perfectionist that I am...I could not help but shell out some money to buy all the data packs. And it is amazing how you can own every set of cards with fraction of amount that would take you to build a single decent deck in MTG (tournament worthy decks sans RDW or burn decks...).

I have yet to actually sit down and play but had chance to play by myself and it definitely is a unique game. My first assessment of this game coming from long time MTG experience is that the core concept is very rigid in that the strategy may not be too diverse (you need ICE breaker as runner to get through no matter what deck you are trying out but corp-side felt very flexible.) bu as more expansions come out, I feel like it can only get better from here on. And honestly, game feels very young in that it has potential to grow even bigger.

What a great deckbuilding game.  Fantasy Flight's LCG system offers a gamer various ways to approach classic CCG's such as Magic: the Gathering.  If you're happy with a simple set, then the core game offers plenty of replayability - 7 different decks in the box with customization available.  Data packs are being released which offer new cards to build upon.  Of course, the serious will collect any and all Data Packs, while the more relaxed of us will pick and choose.
as for the game itself...as a previous Magic player/collector, I am impressed with this system.  As usual with a card game, card draw can kill you, but creating decks against the current meta game is a beautiful challenge I enjoy.  The system is assymetrical in that each player (one the Corp and one the Runner) plays a completely different game.  The Runner is trying to hack into the evil, greedy Corp and steal their precious Agendas while the Corp is trying to defend their assets from the evil hackers.  This results in the two players having different available actions.  The icing on the cake is the bluff/press your luck aspect of the Corp/Runner, respectively.  Do you run against that well defended server assuming the Corp has a juicy Agenda stored there or is it simply bait to lure a greedy Runner to it?  The rewards/penalties are high and is great fun to squirm with these decisions.
Anyone disinterested in MtG because of the 'hard to get into' aspect should seriously consider this LCG.
Have to lower this to an 8 as the game, to me, is about the surprise factor.  Once you've played a deck, you have a decent idea what's in it and that changes how you play against it, especially as the runner.

I've played this more than a dozen times and I'm still on the fence about it. I love the theme, and I like the idea, but I feel like the asynchronous play hurts it, in the sense that I don't think playing the runner is very fun (I feel like you're mostly playing the cards you draw), while playing the corporation is more interesting. Will update with a final opinion after more plays.

Update: We've decided to trade this game away. My wife always enjoyed playing the corporation, but neither of us are all that interested in building decks. Plus, I never really enjoyed playing the runner. I guess it's just not for us.

A great, intricate and strategic card game for two players.  I quickly fell down the rabbit-hole with this game, joining a regular playgroup almost straight away and I have already signed up for my first tournament.

There is an incredible variety in the possible strategies to win the game and the deckbuilding components are, in particular, a really interesting way to explore these strategies.

Unfortunately the game suffers from a couple of minor balance issues and, at the tournament level, there is not an awful lot of variety in the winning decks.  However, in most areas, I am finding a very vibrant meta for this game and, as a result, I am able to play fairly often.

Slick revision of the 1990s classic, which has flown under the radar for too long. I'm glad I restrained myself from buying into original NR, now that this is available and alive again. I like the factioning, and look forward to the upcoming data packs that will add variety and flesh out some of the nascent Corp and Runner abilities. I was never big into the CCG scene, but this plays unlike anything else. 

Typical for FFG, the FAQ helps clean up some of the terminology used but never defined.

NEW UPDATE: I stopped playing after a while. There is something a little off with the way the game flows and it becomes a little fiddly. Compared to SW:LCG and the new GoT:2nd ed LCG it just falls flat

UPDATE: Have played more and more and it keeps getting better. Don't listen to people saying that more base sets are nescesarry, you can easily have tons of fun with just 1 base game. I am impressed with the way that 2 games of Netrunner can play out so very different from each other, even with the same identities going against each other. Compared to Magic, here the game is in actually playing the game, not just in deckbuilding. /END UPDATE

Played 3 times as of this rating. Really really good, lives up to the hype. Love the theme, comes through in the cards. Exciting and not as long as I first thought. Has bluffing, engine building, resource management and each side plays very differently. Got better with more plays, as we started to get to know both our own and the opponents deck. So replayability is very high. Sold off Warhammer Invasion, this is so much better, will be my confrontational 2 player LCG from now on. Well done again Mr Garfied (was never a magic player, only tried the playstation version, but love King of Tokyo and RoboRally)

I'm not sure that open-wallet games like this (and Magic the Gathering) can be fairly compared with regular, single-box euro games, but with all the expansions, Netrunner easily surpasses almost all other games when played between two fairly skilled players.  The core box is quite generous, and allows decent scope for deckbuilding.  Thanks to the game being asymmetrical, you can have a two-player constructed deck game out of a single box without having to draft cards - that's fantastic.  A lot of extra value comes from the large community of skilled players, assuming that you are willing to keep up with all of the datapacks.

Great asymmetric tense two player bluffing card game. This is the kind of game you immediately want to play again and again after a game is finished. I'm not into LCG/CCG, but if I was; this would be the game I'd get. Learning the rules can be a bit daunting at first, but FFG did a great job on the rulebook. I can only recommend to try it out.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is a lot of fun. The game play of the two sides play is very different even though they are both resource/hand management at their heart. The mechanics are full of jargon but once that is overcome they are pretty simple and engaging. The artwork is fantastic which has become the norm for the LCG line of games.

I rate the game an 8 because that's how much fun I think the actual gameplay experience is. However, I'm not really interested in the 'real' game of Netrunner which, like LCGs and CCGs before it, is all about the meta-game. I don't have time to deckbuild and constantly update the game, and my knowledge, with Data Packs and expansions. It's kind of sad that fun and engaging games like this will have to pass me by, but the alternative will only end in madness and frustration.

I invested heavily in the LotR LCG and it remains a fantastic game but I simply don't have the time to enjoy it properly. I like to play a lot of boardgames and don't have the attention span for games like Netrunner. I'll happily play the game though if someone hands me a pre-built deck :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
As a fan of the original I can only say that FFG have knocked this one out of the park.

They have improved the game experience (everything is so smooth!), the art and production is incredible, the cards are nice and the factions in the core set make this really easy to just pick up and play with a LOT of variation to tide you over until the chapter packs start to appear.

As with the original player skill trumps card draws and deck construction, although all three will decide the winner over the course of a match. The thematic integration is excellent.

I'm usually an omni-gamer, never getting too deep into one game, but if a tournament scene develops for this game as i hope it will then I'm in.

*Update* The game just gets better with the first couple of chapter packs released increasing the choices and enabling new strategies. My favourite game of 2012, and not looking like anything will overtake it for 2013 so far.

*Update* First expansion cycle finished and C&C big box out and the game is still going strong. 111 plays not including Octgn. Certainly my favourite game of recent years.

It's perfect... in a timeless cultural vacuum.
Shame about "real life" things getting in the way, like the ever expanding knowledge and cards required for minimal competitive play.
Play it with a card pool you feel like with willing friends and it's amazing: thematically and tactically deep.
Shame about real life, then I'd give it a 7/10 - v expensive and time consuming to break into, might be worth looking elsewhere??

Excellent LCG.  The asymmetric style is very compelling, unique, and surprisingly well-balanced.  The game effectively combines bluffing and deep strategy to create some of the most interesting situations of any game I've played.

The game can be expensive to play competitively since you need 3 copies of the base game to build the really good decks, and expansions come out monthly.  However you can get around this to some extent by playing online.  For casual play a single copy of the base game is sufficient, and in some ways is more balanced with fewer copies of the most powerful cards in the game.  However competitive play is a completely different experience.

Like all games of this type it suffers a bit from balance issues of individual cards being too powerful, but overall it has reasonably good balance and there is an excellent variety of competitive play styles.  The game clearly has very competent designers and play-testers.

The game has just the right amount of luck in my opinion: enough so that the better player is more likely to win but it is never a forgone conclusion.  An advanced player can play a novice and still have an interesting game.  The game has a long skill curve with diminishing returns, which is perfect.

I like Netrunner for the combination of bluffing and planning required to play it well.  The primary downside to me is the runner is much less interesting than the corporation to either build or play.  The LCG model of frequent releases of modest numbers of cards helps keep things interesting by ensuring there are always new options to assimilate and plan around, but can make it feel overwhelming to keep up with the meta.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Android: Netrunner's appeal compared to other LCGs is its theme and the large local player base, making it effectively the only LCG playable competitively. Game-wise, it has enough on offer to pique my interest as a dyed-in-the-wool Eurogamer, never having played any competitive CCG/LCG before. The asymmetric corporation/runner decks with their contrary tasks gives each player a different challenge, avoiding the dreaded tug-of-war feeling.

The truth remains to be revealed though as I have to build my own decks yet. Without deckbuilding, a preliminary 7/10 rating. Validation will show if LCG's could be feasible for me.

It's taken awhile just to play the game correctly with all the new language to learn. The corporation has its own rules and the runner its own. Its like having to learn 2 games in one. This is difficult to teach new players.

I definitely see the appeal of this CCG, but its a hard one to learn. In particular, I found the terminology a bit tricky. Why create so much lingo for new players to learn?

Aside from that the game is fairly similar to MTG. Players deck build and attempt to play card-combos to overwhelm the other player. The game is asymmetric in nature and has a bluffing element to it. I do feel it was a little inelegant compared to MTG (many tokens and credits to keep track of everything).

I've only scratched the surface of this asymmetric card game, and although I was hardly swept away by the experience, I think there should be some fun in exploring cards and building decks; however, this seems to be an activity in which I'm unlikely to engage without a set of my own (or digital equivalent). The theme I find appropriate (and I speak then of hacking, not the Android setting), but not compelling.

Facial expression: bored

The asymmetrical game is the thing I like most about it, and I don’t like that much. The theme is OK, too, but from there on it’s all downhill.

I seriously dislike the self-consciously melodramatic rulebook with its ladled-on thematic jargon that makes the game a total bear to learn. And then I dislike the game. Asymmetry is great, but the game is broken if the two sides are playing different games, the outcome of both depending hugely on how the decks - particularly the corporation deck - happen to be sequenced. The play is made more tedious because it focuses on accumulating credits, rather than on the nominal action of the game, which involves few decisions (run? not run?), and a rather tedious kind of bluff, all of which makes, in my view, for a lengthy, dull exchange across a litter of gaudy cards, with little or no interest or engagement.

The game strikes me as a dud, but game apart, I dislike even more the whole Living Card Game concept. It seems wildly stupid for people to buy into a game that is designed for enthusiasts who will buy cards that are so powerful that they crush anyone who has a standard deck. I understand that logic perfectly from the company’s point, but I’m not the company and I’d rather play a game where everyone at the table differs mainly in their wits and experience, not the money they’ve spent on kit. I understand that people get a buzz out of building a great deck, and testing it over the board, and going back to their FLGS to improve it a little more, but that entire world of addictive acquisition leaves me colder than a penguin in a blizzard. 

Pokemon left me puzzled; Netrunner leaves me numb.

I'm downgrading this rating from a 9 to a 6.5 because even after owning it I still have no idea what half the terms mean without looking them up.

Can't we just pay for things with gold like every other game in the world.  I love the way this game works mechanically but in all honesty I would rather play just about anything else I own because teaching and learning the game is such a beatdown.

The 9 is more for the game as it was the first year or so of release.

This is the only TCG-style card game I've played that derives almost nothing from Magic, and it's a lot better for it.  Of course, leave it to the original designer of Magic to not reinvent his own wheel.

The game excels in having lots of interesting, paradigm-shifting features (asymmetric gameplay, lots of bluffing, different gameplay styles, action points rather than phases, and a very egalitarian art direction), all of which reserve its spot next to my most interesting board games.  When people say this game is good, they aren't kidding.

The flow of this game is beautiful. When you are the runner every decision you do is so crucial and tense that you can feel the tension between you and the corp. Do you run that server? Is there trap there that might kill you? Do you have enough money to avoid a sea source? Every decision matters! On the other hand as the corp you are worried about completely different things. Can the runner pass that server? Can I score before he finds his breakers? Do I have enough money? Even though I play this casually I still feel so connected to the game, It's just insane. My only complaint is it is hard to teach new players this game since it is quite a commitment.

RATING: 8
The asymmetrical aspect of the game really works. It's a fun 2-player game .

I really enjoy the CCG aspect without feeling compelled to purchase endless, expensive booster packs. I have the first 6 data packs (packs of ~30 cards), but I've stopped grabbing the expansions due to limited tabletime.

Even as-is, I have plenty of cards to enjoy match-ups.

UPDATE: Expansions come out far too often for me. It feels too much like the CCGs that I wanted to avoid. There's a great game underneath the barrage of expansions, but it's too expensive for casual players to keep up with.

RATING: 6
Sold my CCG cards and upgraded.  Never looked back.  Adding identities for the runner and corp was genius.

Update:  LCG model killed it for me.  No interest in casual play from my group.  So much wasted potential.

Sold.

RATING: 6
Great game, the only reason that I don't rate it higher is because it's a LCG. I didn't really fully understand what that meant when I bought it but I have no intention of keeping up with such an aggressive release schedule and meta game. The idea of deck-building outside of the game does not appeal to me. I would love this as a standalone game like Ashes with fixed decks for each corporation and runner. I should just pick up all of the first cycle and maybe the big box expansions and play it this way.Expansions Owned: Study in Static, Cyber Exodus, Future Proof, Humanity's Shadow, Trace Amount, What Lies Ahead, Data and Destiny, Honor and Profit, Order and Chaos, Creation and Control (and I'm out).

Initial response after about 8 plays - this is WAY too random and stupid to be played by adult brains, yet, it's so complex that you need an adult brain to really learn how to play.  Too much content, with way more on the way.  Too many huge windfall mechanisms - like attacking the guy's R&D, especially with that card that lets you draw 3?  That could potentially win you the game right then and there.  Horrible.

I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 1 because it's playable and it has a good presentation and it has some actually really nice mechanisms.  Just too bad it's so random and has so much chaff.

This sucks.  3 is generous.

This game would be a 10 - the only thing is, that is a drain on my wallet - i really want all the expansions! And in order to play in any store tournament, you need to keep up with the meta in the current release.
However, if you agree with your opponent(s) that you can play with proxies or with "older" cards only, then this game is a definite 10 and the best card game I have ever played.

RATING: 9
After only a couple of games, I see the appeal.  The possibilities for customizing decks and the different corporate and runner factions seem to offer a lot of replays.  There are many things to do each turn.

The asymmetrical play appeals to me.  I want to try both the corporate and the runner sides, customize decks, buy the expansions and play this game a lot!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
A really fun asymmetric card game with a cyberpunk theme - what's not to love? I really enjoy this game for different layers of strategy it has: deck building, limited actions in a turn, bluffing, etc. 

As one of the many who played Magic way back when - and loved it, LCGs like this are amazing in comparison. Not only do you not have to worry about the insanity that comes with all things "collectible", but you can really experience the whole of this game with only the base set.

For an LCG this is probably the best one I've ever played.  I liked it enough to own it for awhile but I now feel the same way as many boardgame players about it.  It's the sort of game people play near to exclusively and once a lot of packs have been released past the core set there just isn't much that can be done to participate with those folks.  I by no means dislike the game.  From a design standpoint the game is 10/10 as an LCG but I am utilizing BGG rating definitions and, as such, it's no longer a game I'm really looking to play or be invested in.  Kind of miss it though.  Such a great theme and unique mechanics.

I've now played enough games to get a grip of it. It's definitely one of my favourite games. Personally I would give it a 10, but settle for a 9.5, mainly because it's a niche game making it a bit difficult to find someone to play with, someone who understands and appreciates the mechanics and ideas of the game. Secondary because I get the impression that some features of the game aren't accessible unless you're very skilled or happen to get the right combination of Hacker and Corporation deck of cards, something that over time might prove to be a pro of how versatile the game is.

I have played a metric butt-load of CCG/LCGs in my time, but none of them compare to Netrunner. Everything about this game is great: the theme, the deck building, the asymmetric play, the bluffing, the agonizing decisions ... all condense and interlock into a perfect gameplay experience. Yes, the learning curve is a little steep, and the community's jargon can be daunting to parse, but persevere and soon you'll reach gaming nirvana.

2/12/14 have all expansions to date. What a superb game. Good art, excellent gameplay, lots of ways to deck build. Nice you HAVE to play 2 sides (unlike Mtg where its possible to just be a Red and Black player ALL THE TIME)

Jo has a starter box and a few data packs

16/5/15 having reading a lot of the comments of people giving this game "1", I had a few thoughts.
1)you need 2 base sets to play - a bit true; you dont NEED 2 but its useful (and 3 if you want to have 3 of EVERY card).
2) No variety - these comments come from the starter box; there were 7 IDs but they were a bit limited. But now, 3.5 cycles and 3 "big boxes" in there are a LOT of choices.
3) Only bluffing and totally random - a bit, but I think the bluffing is what makes this game.

The new version of the classic Netrunner card game. It is an asymmetrical card game where one player is a mega-corporation attempting to protect and advance agendas while the other player is a hacker determined to break in and 'liberate' the information the corporation is so desperate to protect. It is a game of strategy, resource management, and bluffing and it is quite fun to play as either side. 

I like the original game as well but the rules tweaks, aesthetic re-work, and conversion to a non-collectible game all combine to bring this version up a few notches.

I have a feeling this is going to stay this way for a long time too, especially with how I have only played 3 of the 7 decks the base game comes with. I'll give another update when I'm more plays in.

1/24/15 11 plays in: This game is still fun, but unfortunately i don't play that often because most of the meetups for the game are farther away from me. I also need to start deckbuilding, as the starter decks are pretty generic. I'm in the midst of start a meetup in my area for netrunner though.

[size=12][b]Why I like Android: Netrunner:[/b][/size]
+ I like how the asymmetrical decks (between the runner and corporation) can be balanced to a fairly even win rate.
+ The game is easy to teach (for casual play at least).
+ The game incorporates mechanics that I like.
+ The game is short.
+ The game requires meaningful decisions to win.
+ The game has decent replayability as a result of the various ways you can build a deck, play the game, etc.

[size=12][b]Fixable dislikes in regards to Android: Netrunner:[/b][/size]
/ I am not particularly interested in collectible games as this model tends to cost a fortune. Android: Netrunner is not entirely collectible and instead uses a LCG model. The LCG model is good for ensuring that the game is up to date, which I like. However, I am still not interested in keeping up to date with the various releases. I think that video games make this process easier. Anyway, the solution here is to just play with the revised core set.

I am not sure how I feel about this game.  It is fun to play, sure.  But it is so complicated to teach and explain.  

I like the game out of the box, though the rulebook is a little confusing and the box insert is less-than-worthless.  But I am not really sure how to take the deckbuilding aspect:  it's nice, but it's sort of a slippery slope: once you start, everyone you play with has to do it too.  I feel that it quickly degrades into a contest of who can set up the best deck, and then it becomes less about the play.

So, I certainly enjoy the game, but I just don't think it will ever become a favorite.

I'm in deep shock - this game is just AMAZINGLY GOOD! :) 

I've been playing MTG for many years, I still play some serious poker and I've been a Sci-Fi fan since I was 5. 

This game fits the bill for all of the above & does it absolutely great! There's such a big asymmetry between runners & corporations, the variety of cards is so big & yet they manage to keep it pretty balanced (at least so far). 

I really considered not to get into another deck-building / CCG / LCG game, but now I can't stop clicking "refresh" on FFG site to see if there are new spoilers for the upcoming packs :)

Having played Magic for over 15 years, I have some expectations from LCGs and TCGs. This one seems to be the most random I've ever played, and hopefully I don't ever have to again. I played few times as corp, which was mildly amusing, if simple. Rest of the times I played as hacker, where you were forced to run blind and hope to get lucky in order to score points. In short: if hacker is a luckbag, there is no way corp will ever win, if he is not, corp will surely win, as all ways for hacker to score points are totally random. It is interesting if hacker is a mediocre luckbag, as both players have an option to win.

Fairly easy to learn the mechanics but the game play is very rich and deep meaning you can play for a while and still learn new things.  There is too much power creep in the expansions which means if you have the base box you can't really play against people that have a few expansions.

A fun two player game that is fast to set up and doesn't run too long.  Good for when you don't have much time.

Update:  It almost never gets played because the more experienced player always wins which makes it not fun when playing with friends who are new to it (for me and them).  I'm not interested in playing in tournaments.  Doesn't get much use any more.

I usually don't enjoy much randomness in my games, so it's quite surprising that I love Android: Netrunner so much. The asymmetric gameplay, bluffing, analysis, risk-taking, strategy, adaptation, etc., all come together to create such a deep and rewarding experience. Even after deck creation, there's so much importance on how you play the game and how well you read the other player. I think the only drawback to this richness is the learning curve to design your own decks and play very competitively (if that's your goal).

Hands down the best of Fantasy Flight's LCGs, the only issue I have with it is the lack of tournament support and few players which is more a knock on my scene than anything else.

On its way to my home. Haven't played any games, even on OCTGN, but got hooked by the LCG format and the youtube videos. Though I don't have anyone to play with now, I will collect anything A:N-related and hopefully find someone to play in my area.

Update 12/7/2014: After a while, I think I'm more of a Netrunner collector than a player. One reason is that I don't have a playgroup to play with, but I think the main reason is I suck at this game as Runner, which in my opinion is the exciting part of the game.

---

Update 21/9/ 2014: As I get better playing as Runner, the game does feel more appealing to me. I begin to be able to analyze the game state and make more meaningful actions to react to it, not just auto-pilot like I did before (like when I played Corp). Bumped to a 9.

RATING: N/A
Android: Netrunner is an asymmetrical Living Card Game for two players. Set in the cyberpunk future of Android and Infiltration, the game pits a megacorporation and its massive resources against the subversive talents of lone runners.

Corporations seek to score agendas by advancing them. Doing so takes time and credits. To buy the time and earn the credits they need, they must secure their servers and data forts with "ice". These security programs come in different varieties, from simple barriers, to code gates and aggressive sentries. They serve as the corporation's virtual eyes, ears, and machine guns on the sprawling information superhighways of the network.

► Best card game
► Best expandable card game

Once I tackled the rules (and special terms), I completely fell in love with this game for many good reasons: great theme (dystopian cyberpunk sci-fi), gorgeous artworks, very clever game design, great mechanisms, completely asymmetrical roles for two players, great strategic depth, Expandable/"Living" Card Game format (no blind booster pack gambling), very high replay value, pre-game deckbuilding/strategising, bluffing, 2 factions split into different sub-factions (each with their strengths and weaknesses).

One of the finest games I ever played.

RATING: 7.5
Mechanically this game is superior top almost every other card game I have ever played. The Theme is awesome and fits in really well with the game play. What you have to realize is you are not playing the cards in hour hand or against the other players card but against the other player. your attitude body language and how you play is more important than the cards in your hand.

I love this game. The asymmetry is fantastic, and I like that it's just as much about the other player as the cards. I have trouble getting it out to play however. My wife doesn't enjoy it much, and when it's a game night where folks would enjoy it I usually want to be playing something with more people.

Jesus.. it took me about 3-4 years to finally get it to the table. My first game was rather okey (very basic Weyland and Shaper decks), but after my third game it really took off. My spouse also loves it and she absolutely destroyed my Jinteki deck. But guess what.. Although I've lost 0:7 I've had a lot of fun. Most LCGs tend to show their beauty after 8-10 games (SW:LCG, L5R etc.), but this one did it right out of the gate. It's fast, it's complex and weeeeeeeeird. I love it.

edit: After over 30 plays in 5 weeks I can absolutely say it's one of the best games I've ever played - if you're willing to get into deck constructing beforehand.

Why play keep playing magic for 20 years when Netrunner is the next generation of card games? Groundbreaking, innovative, and excellent art/theme.

I recently sold off my collection because the community is quite small and tournament play is too competitive - with a rapidly changing meta that requires a high time investment to stay on top of.

I would LOVE to stay in this game if there were CASUAL formats like Draft. Unfortunately, there just ain't enough players to pull it off, and the LCG format makes drafting all but obsolete.

Starting at a 9. I could see this moving up or down as time goes on, but for now I want to play it all the time.

As of December 2012, it's a 10. Watching these expansions roll in is going to be revealing.

May downgrade to a 9 now that the Genesis cycle is fully out and FFG don't seem to give a crap about high-level balance.

After playing C&C, I'm more convinced that they blew it with a faction-specific box that didn't help one of the factions. High-level play is less balanced than ever. Back down to a 9.

(I've played around 80 post-C&C games, and hundreds of pre-C&C games.)

After the first couple of Spin Cycle packs (December 2013), this is back to a 10.

2014: back down to a 9.

2015 was a pretty rocky year for Netrunner, imo, and 2016's been a disaster. Down to a 7.

Total noob at the moment. Played it just 6 times. And only as the corporation.
I need more plays to give it a rating.

At the moment I do not see where the fun is in this game.
Maybe because I have not played as the runner yet. 
To be honest, I get bored half way through the game every time because I feel there is nothing interesting I can do.

But I am willing to give this game a few more chances.

Picked up first day at Gencon 2012, and played it at least 10 times total over the past weekend.  Why buy it?  Heavy hacker, corporate defense themed game, incorporating an elegant card structure in the dystopian future.  First impression:  awesome game!  I'm a sucker for 'Blade Runner' or dystopian games, with this being no exception.  I'm a huge fan of Android as well, even though the game is a little clunky with its mechanics, it's still a lot of fun.  Netrunner on the other hand, is very easy and perfectly executed, but keeping the Android style theme alive and well.  

The corporation (you can pick from various ones) has the complex task of protecting its servers with various ICE and anti-runner defense tactics, while the runner tries to infiltrate them.  The runner installs custom programs, hardware, and resources to his liking - you get to build your own hacker computer!  It's a very cool system, easy to learn, and has enough complexity to add years of enjoyment.  Can't wait for additional sets to be released.

RATING: 6
Played several times.  I love the original Netrunner.  It was so flavorful, suspenseful, with a very tight design.  It also really should never've been released as a CCG.  This newest incarnation is nearly perfect.  I love all of their design tweaks, the deckbuilding rules, and the theme integration into FFG's similar proprietary setting.  My only complaint - not enough of each card in the base set to build any deck.  But that is so minor, considering you get plenty of cards to play the pre-constructed decks, and expansions should provide tons of new options.  

The last 4 games of this have given me reason to adjust my rating and opinion.  Those games have simply not been fun, at all, and I'm not entirely certain why.  They have all been lop-sided affairs, and that's never really fun. I suppose if I had a regular opponent that was really into the game, I might have reason to play more.  But as it stands, I have little desire to play again.  And another fun memory is ground to dust under the wheel of reality...

Played the game once as the corporation in order to experience the game once for my own culture. I did not like much the game, but I think there are interesting mechanics in there.

I lacked money all the time and I rarely had the cards to get more money. I think that is one of the flaws of the game is that you are dependent on the luck of the draw and the design of your deck. If you don't get the right cards to do the basic stuff, then the game won't cover up for you.

For example, I was short of money all the time and could not get any way to make money. I managed to discard randomly the few cards my opponent needed to break the type of ICE I had, making me impossible to get attacked. which made me win the game.

I also liked the terminology which somewhat reinforces the theme constantly ad you play even if the game is very mechanical. 

So it will not appeal to everybody, I don't like it much but I cannot say it's a bad game.

I was eager to try this one out, but I am thankful that I got a chance to play it at GenCon before I had to buy it.I just don't see what all the fans see in this game. It plays well, and has some interesting mechanics for a CCG, especially the asymetrical play styles of the corporations and the runners. The game does a good job in presenting a world, a lingo, and a whole way of thinking for each player. Overall though the game just fell flat with me.

RATING: 9
+ The menaces are quite clear, even when they are not precise, which is a plus compared to Magic: the Gathering, where it is often hard to guess that an Instant might be cast. In Netrunner, the Runner *knows* that an installed card might be a deadly Asset. He *knows* that ICE is dangerous, even when they are not rezzed. This creates an interesting tension, a real sense of purpose, real, concrete goals to attain, which are very thematic. Both Innovation and Race offer goals (tactical goals, for Innovation, strategic goals, for Race).

+ The need for Credits, for scoring Agendas, for protection by ICE, for Programs that can break ICE, etc., all this creates a nice tension. A little bit like wanting to play all your cards in Agricola without being able to, a little like having many nice plans in Race without being able to implement them all, a little like needing to get a majority of icons in Innovation and struggling to get it.

$ I was initially disappointed to have so many copies of a single card, in the Core set: I was afraid that this would limit the versatility of the deck. However, a Magic: the Gathering deck does not really have many more different cards, because of the presence of Lands, and Magic games have a huge variety. I don't yet know if a similar variety is present in Netrunner, but it is not excluded.

- During my first couple of games, I missed a few rule points, and/or had to refer to the rulebook. Not a completely trivial rule set. Not too complicated, though. The theme helps making it simple enough.

+ The game can be unforgiving: it seems that there is sometimes a *single strategy* that has to be followed in order not to lost.

+ I like to come back to the game because I want to learn to *see* this strategy. The bluffing aspect makes it some kind of meta-game, sometimes. This is quite unique. For example: my opponent might have 3 agendas in HQ, unprotected, and an agenda in a remote server, unprotected: I must learn that this opponent might not be afraid to do this, and I should do runs on these servers.

+ This game is also quite unique in that little clues picked up at the right time can really make a difference. Example: a person putting an ICE before an Agenda or Asset on a Remote Server: this may mean that the card is an Agenda, as the player was afraid to leave it unprotected, psychologically, even during their turn. Another example: during a Run on HQ, a person might shuffle their cards: it may mean that there is an Agenda in there, as otherwise the shuffling becomes less relevant.

- I don't like so much waiting for the actions of my opponent, or taking multiple actions in a turn: I am afraid that my opponent will be bothered. I prefer the fast pace of Agricola, or the simultaneous actions of Race, or the often interactive turns of Magic. After a dozen games and a few games with the same decks, things flow faster, though; I still feel some pressure to keel the game going while I go through my actions. 

$ Less rich and deep than Race. I enjoyed tasting the game though: I feel like I am getting to know it a little better and starting to enjoy its subtleties. The learning pace is slow, though; not that the game is difficult, but it does not move so fast: it takes time to accumulate ICE, or ICE breakers, so the number of in-game situations is not so large (it is even slower than Magic: the Gathering, where Creatures come and go relatively fast). That said, I still feel like a child who is learning how to walk: I don't feel fully in control: I want to keep exploring the potential of this game.

- It is not always so easy to keep track of the number of actions, again, despite using tokens taken by the opponent, like in Jambo. Or remembering to take a Credit through the Pad Campaign,…

Also, there is not so much to do when waiting for your opponent (maybe that's why I tend to be a little bored and not follow the actions of my opponent precisely). Netrunner is much closer to Magic, in this respect (but Magic has faster turns, which helps), than to Race for the Galaxy.

I love the mind game. The closest games I have that give this feeling are Lord of the Rings: the Confrontation (especially during combat, and also a bit during movement, with many laughs too), Skull (many laughs too, but there is not much to think about), games with simultaneous actions (Race for the Galaxy, but the guessing is only on which actions will be chosen, and does not have much consequences, and games where the choices matter much but live in a more limited space than in Netrunner, because it's mostly about simultaneous movement: 2 de Mayo and Clockwork Wars).

 There's no question why this game didn't make it as a CCG -- it's a tough nut to crack. Even with pre-built decks and some experience my friend and I found it difficult to know what we should be doing, and it seems like the Corporation has an especially rough go of it. We clearly need more experience to tease out the strategies. Still, it plays fast, the production is nice (though some of the artwork is still stuck in the 90s), and the card mix is interesting. There's a lot packed into this starter set, and I'm going to enjoy trying it all out.

Excellent card game. I have played many games using all the factions. I enjoy the deck building, love the theme and really enjoy the strong bluff aspect of the game. Only reason it doesn't not get a 10 is that I hate buying a box full of air and the occasions when the game takes a hour plus.

Great game right out of the box.
** play very well as a boardgame box for 2p **
( is now a go to game for me and my ex )

Fairly deep and plays with poker like nuance.
Intense game which does not take long to play and clean up.

The only downsides are;
1. the fact that the game is not complete in itself
2. the base box alone would not be viable enough for competitive and out-of-your-gaming-group plays

both of which are inherent in the LCG model itself.

Core Set
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
While I enjoy the basic core set I do feel a tad shortchanged. Many cards have 3 copies however, there are a few with only 2 copies; I'm wondering why this was printed this way for any other reason than greed. However, I do suspect that the game will only increase in strength and playability as the new data packs are released.

I really love the asymmetric quality of this card game which allows bluffing which is, in my mind, one of a card game's primary mechanics and often not utilized very effectively. Here I get this mechanic and so much more. Even though I enjoy playing the bluff (i.e. the Megacorps) I most enjoy the Runner aspects of detecting and counter-detecting bluffs. This game hasn't reached parity amongst all factions yet but it's fast approaching. With just a few more data packs released (there are only two so far) this will happen some time in the next year.

Update: August 2015

I fucking LOVE this game. My favorite card game; no competition. The asymmetry perfectly suits the LCG format.

Corp: MBN 'Tag n Bag'
Runner: Anarch 'Tag Me'

Far moreso than MtG, deckbuilding feels natural with careful consideration to the powercurve and meta regarding the consistent game design. And no banned cards. What is this science? I guess we'll have to see if this holds.

This is the ONLY LCG or recurring purchase I intend to stick with until they pry my debit card from my cold, dead hands.

And now that my group has embraced draft, cube design is consuming me. So much fun.

Love. This. Game.

This game is so well designed I have nearly nothing to complain about. I would like them to include some basic deck builds to show A:N's deck building potential out of the box.

We were never big LCG players and with all the hype with Netrunner we decided to try it.

The first few attempt, we were luke warm on the game, however after several plays and attempt to deck build our own characters, it has really change our view on this game. 

We love it. 

The learning curve is steep. Takes 2-3 games to fully grasp it depending on player experience. 

I recommend deck building after a few try with basic deck. The experience is very different. That was the game changer for us.

After playing this for 1,5 years I increase my rating from 9.5 to 10. I played probably around 600 games of this and still want to play it all the time.

Never played an LCG before this, so I was not sure if this was for me. But I bought the core box to try. After having watched the intro video from FFG it wasn't even as hard to learn and teach as I expected from the comments here. It fascinated me from the start. The asymmetric play gives a completely different feel depending on if you are runner or corp. There are so many options for every action, and every action seems to matter. This does not even include deck building. With deck building the variety is endless and i really enjoy exploring the different playstyles of the different IDs.

Always looking forward to the next game. Excellent!

RATING: 7
A very unique asymmetric card game, the corporations and runner definitely play very differently. The hackers not knowing what servers contain and being able to more strongly disrupt the corporation by messing with their hand and deck fits with the theme very well. The only downsides to this game are one: it isn't super gentle on giving those new to it a fighting chance and two: the difference from getting one lucky run from the corporation's hand can make a huge difference in the game, as even a 2 point card is almost a third of the game for the runner.

interesting asymmetric card game designed by the infamous Richard Garfield.  It is believed to be his best work.

Overall i quite liked the game and playing the co-op and runner gives different feel.  unlike magic the gathering it is a living card game so you don't have throw $$ down the drain.  However as u grow older you find u have less time for games and deck building is quite time consuming.  Also looking for oppononents in HK may be difficult.

RATING: 8
From my initial plays, I love the asymmetry, the depth of the game, and the varied strategies. The only downside is that there seems to be a huge luck component. Apart from the usual initial draw and whether you get the right mix of cards, you have the luck involved in runs on Headquarters or R&D, or stumbling on different ices.

Update: This is definitely a great game. Very deep with many different strategies. I still think the luck element is too much, but reasonable. The part about being a LCG is what made me get out of it. I couldn't get people to play on a regular basis of my same level, and trying to join Netrunner nights would put me at a huge disadvantage unless I kept up with every pack.

6 plays so far, 3 as each side. The runner so far has won every game with the exception of one, but only just barely. Incredibly tense, tons of tactics, and lots of nuances that make it a very intriguing game. I don't think the base game comes with enough cards at the moment to make a deck that is really "yours" but what is on display is a very solid start, consider me hooked

Netrunner is one of those special games where the play and player interaction outshines the actual system. The core game is a 9, but because players can play the game well and win rather than just build well and win speaks volumes.

I'm at 60 plays and never looking back. In a way it's good that Netrunner failed in the early days because I think the time for things to simmer, ideas about card games to evolve, and players to mature as, well, players, makes now the right time for it to re-emerge. That it is not collectible is simply the cherry on top.

RATING: 6
I love the asynchronous game play, but the rules are complex and unless you are playing regularly, very easy to forget.

Playing as a corporation can be a little boring if the Runner is more passive, as you end spending most of your time milling your deck and making sure that you can pay for all the ice you've already put out.

When it's a good game though, I'd rate it much higher.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Type: directly competitive 2-player customizable card game with asymmetrical game play.

Best With: 2
Weight: Medium
Duration: 15-45 minutes
Notes:
Can use base decks, but best with someone who will be interested in customizing decks on their own time.
Entirely card-based with plenty of text and effects on those cards.
Does require knowing opponent's cards decently well for best enjoyment.
Luck based on card draws.

An excellent game that I love playing. The artwork, theme, asynchronous play, balance, and huge card pool once you get into the expansions and data packs are top notch.

The biggest downside, and it can be a very big one, is the fact that this is a customizable card game. In small gaming groups, this game will always be slightly unbalanced towards players who take the most time *before* their gaming sessions to research current decks and tailor their decks to their desired play styles. This game is best played by players willing to put time into creating their decks before the gaming session, and by players of relatively equal interest in the game. Sitting down at the table and making your deck right then is just not going to cut it; those players should instead look to deck-building games.

Also, a player who just owns the core set will always be at a very big disadvantage to a player who has 2 core sets plus various other expansion sets. Likewise, a small gaming group will need to have a relatively similar level of interest amongst all the players to have a good time. But if one player in a group of 4 dives in full on and gets more data packs, he's going to be at a huge advantage over the others.


That said, if ever there was a game that could be affordable and yet scratch the Magic: The Gathering itch without requiring players to chase rares, this game is it. Solid, deep, relatively easy to learn, but very hard to master, especially as the card pool continues to grow.

if I have a pair of decks at hand already made and somewhat up-to-date with current cards, I'll happily always play this game.

One of my favorite games. Two totally different play styles as the runner or the corp. Brilliant. 

The expansions have not been used yet as I am not yet sure what to add or take away. Will get to that with more plays under my belt I think.

Used the expansion cards now and still getting used to the decks so we are trying to stick to one faction each for a few games. So far so good.

I played the original, 'cyberpunk,' version of this, which I've always though was one of the most original games, thematically and mechanically, even to come out of the USA. I can totally see why so many serious games have gotten addicted to this re-implementation. What makes Netrunner so much fun is the dramatic tension of every game, as players scramble for cover at the beginning then smash all their most expensive resources against one another at the end.

I have somewhat mixed feelings about setting the new version in Kevin Wilson's ANDROID universe. The art comes across as lamely cartoony compared to the original, which at the time really did catch the edgy, underground ambiance of the cyberpunk movement. But there's no denying the richness and originality of the gameworld, and the fact that one can play other games and read (surprisingly well-written!) novels about the same characters and setting really does make this whole thing a bit of a special moment in the history of the hobby.

I've played several games of this, both Runner and Corporation, played all basic decks besides the Anarch Netrunner and dabbled in a single deckbuilding game, which went terribly for me.

I'm having a very hard time judging this game. I love the theme, artwork, and idea, but can't wrap my head around the gameplay. I keep having enormous economic problems with both the Corp and Hacker (less so with the latter), and find that I can't attack nor defend well, even against novice players. That, plus the fact that I've got a very bad feeling about the game format, will probably mean I'll never be able to get invested in the game enough to seek out matches.

It seems to be a big hit among my friends, so if there's a mini-Netrunner scene going on in a month or two, I may be tempted to join in, but I've got a feeling I'm "too old" for CCG-like games. I just can't see myself investing enough time and sinking enough money in this to play it in any other way than casually - and you can't really do that once people around you start buying expansions and doing serious deckbuilding.

I'm rather disillusioned and disappointed at this point. Unfortunately, I may be forced to sell my set off to one of my friends - the idea of a game so thematic and so awesome in what it does which didn't appeal to me is almost painful :(

01.12.12 - with a heavy heart, I'm letting this one go. I can't see myself getting into it, I don't have the morale to keep trying to love it anymore. Just another unnecessary buy-and-sell in my collection, only this time the disappointment is extreme.

03.08.14 - and just a follow-up comment. Holy shit, fanboys of this game are INSUFFERABLE. There's no explaining to them why I think this game is deeply flawed in both its rules and its format. All I ever get back is ridicule. It makes me feel even worse about this title.

Played a couple of partial test games of this having watched 2 of the good tutorial videos.

The manual is large and rather daunting but as with most FFG manuals it has tons of example pages and also in this one at least 4 pages of backstory.

Game is very different to other card games and I like the representation of servers that it has. I think it fits well with the theme. It doesn't feel too complex and I don't think it is, just there is quite a lot to be aware of. Am sure that an doing a number of actions incorrectly.

Arguably the best trading card game ever designed since over 10 years ago, and I've played many card games in between and currently still an active WoW TCG player.
The new version make guessing your opponent's deck easier, and this strangely makes the game both more enjoyable and easier to grasp. Strongly recommended!
Edited on 9/8/2014: resumed playing after a long hiatus, almost 6 mini plus 1 major expansion. The recurring cards from graveyard seems to make this game very one sided, no matter for the corp or runner. I'm worried about this game's balance in the future esp FFG is actually publishing very few cards per year compared with the old ccgs. Rating down to 8.

So many good things said about this, and despite already being well-obsessed with Magic, this is still be a good addition as something different of a dueling game.  Also, maybe Abigail will want to build decks from here over the MtG cards, since she doesn't have to be tempted to buy a booster like the later.  Every deck faction is different, and can even be built different within them.

Ordered off of Amazon.  Then got a second one in trade with C&C and the first 6 data packs for Ladies and Gentlemen, String Railway, the Archipelago: Solo Expansion, and $20.

First impressions is that gameplay is a little more proscriptive than in other CCGs/LCGs that I've played. It's also not obvious what strategies there are, though this is most likely due to some bland cards in the starter and a general unfamiliarity with the flow of the game.

I've committed myself to sticking with this at least through the first cycle; my impression is that the expansion cards are really necessary to give the player any feeling of being in control of his strategy.

This game is an interesting propossal for a Card game, since each player has a different play where the corporation sets traps to protect their agenda and the netrunners plays to bother the corporation, i feel that this base set really needs some expansions or even buy 2 boxes to make decks right. Great starter but for experimented card games need a little more flavor that i´m sure will come with the tons of expansions to come.

The best 2 player card game. Asymmetric game play with a lot of different Identities to chose from keeps the game fresh and of course the Living Card Game format where you get new cards all the time helps with it. So many possibilities to build your deck around and the value of cards really depend on your gaming environment (meta) as people try out new combinations to exploit your weaknesses while trying to negate your strengths. The game has strong elements of bluffing and guessing your opponents moves which I really like.

I just love this game. Game play is really tense and a small miscalculated risk can cause you the game against a strong player. After 50 plays I feel like I have only scratched the surface. I have taught this game to at least 7 of my friends and some of them were immediately hooked and bought their own. It's getting harder to get anything else on the table these days.

Apart from breathing new life into a justly venerated card game classic, FFG have done good on Netrunner  by getting a better grip on a playable core set. If you compare this with the stuttery start of the Cthulhu LCG with its unwieldy highlander approach, there really has been a steep evolution. I’ve gotten a lot of play out of this without touching the starting decks so far, and have made a firm pact with myself that I will not get into real deckbuilding until the first cycle is completed.

Until then, I’m pretty sure that modifying the core decks will offer a lot of potential all by itself, probably helped along by the cat-and-mouse nature of the game. So far, I can attest that the hype got it right this time, and continuing the background of Android, one of my favorite games, is just icing on the cake.

Amazing. Hands down my favorite LCG. Every faction feels and acts differently. Drips theme and oozes replayability. I want more and more cards. Favorite factions are Weyland, NBN and Shapers.

RATING: 8.6
Really fun. So far a little imbalanced toward runners, and I do hope they release a pack or something so I can have three of every card without having to buy three boxes, but it's superbly designed and still feels novel after ten or so plays.

While I do enjoy NR, the complexity of the game can be a little bit of a bear at times. We are sunsetting this one.

Love the theme and asymmetrical play. Lots of options (and growing with each pack/cycle) on how you can build your deck. If there are downsides, they would be the complexity and the possible unlucky shuffle that will kill your day. Money/credits are vital!!

RATING: 9
Great game. I mean, really great. Up to date the best card game out there. 

Quite time-consuming as there are too many strategies which need careful planning and deck-testing. A deck-Builder is a must to have a strategical overview and speed up. Pays off for all players of previous card games like Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, Magic as well as online gamers (Hearthstone etc.)

As per my personal taste (biased of course):
Minus one point since you simply can´t bring the game to a friend who does not own this game by himself without having preconstructed decks which need explicit explanation how to pilot the deck.

Personally I dealt with this issue as I made my very own variant. :-)

Android Netrunner has replaced Magic the Gathering has become my favorite duel card game. Weird theme, cyberpunk theme and steep learning curve can turn off a lot of people, but I think this game provides much better experience than other duel card games. You should definitely try the game before buying it though. The LCG model is much more appealing than the CCG model which is still used in MtG.

As a former Magic player, I'm blown away by the novelty of this assymmetric design, that is still balanced to perfection. I liked Netrunner the first time around, too, when published by WOTC. I'm not familiar with the Android setting, but it appears to have fit the previous game like a glove, even making some good additions to it.

I don't like deck building outside of the game.  I know that this makes me unusual, but I would only play Netrunner with the pre-made decks, and I don't want to spend the time to learn those cards that makes the game good because of my lack of interest in building up the decks.  So, the game is good, but I simply don't think I will be playing it much at all.

I rate CCGs and their expandable cousins (LCGs, etc.) on this basis: "I will likely never invest in one again, but assuming that someone else hands me a deck here's what I think of the game."

I hated the original Netrunner. The new one is a lot more interesting.

Even based on just one play, I see layers of interlocking strategy, tactics, and elements from other games -- like Poker -- that are really neat. I imagine with some time and money and a local meta this would be a blast to get into.

I didn't love it, though. Maybe that's a function of trying a basic weenie vs. wall game as my first, since that dynamic -- which never changed and was really dull -- is what I loathed about the original. But I'd happily play it again and would love to see some other kinds of deck cross my gaming table.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Great game.  Out of the box, no need for more than one base set unless you have larger plans (like more than one game going at once).  A nice incremental improvement over the original - living vs. dead, art, graphic design of cards, coherent theme.  Highly recommended for people who like tense two player card games.  I am already waiting very impatiently for more cards... more more more!!!  This game could get a 10 rating, I am always thinking about it.

Now over 100 ftf games. Simply put, a classic. Detractors haven't played this game and are stuck thinking the old version is somehow better, it isn't (played it a lot in the day). If you like card games with tension and tough decisions, this is it.

Only tiny complaint is the lack of 3 copies of every card in the base set. Also, if you don't like designing your own deck stay away from the whole genre of customizable games (including this one).

One of the best (if not the best) 2-player games I've ever played. To play one player builds and plays a "Corporation" deck with "Agenda" cards that they attempt to play and score. The other player is a "runner" who attempts to steal agenda cards before they are scored. The asymmetrical aspect is so well done. Each faction plays specific cards to help them, while their counterpart has specific cards designed to stop them. The game uses smaller decks than other card games, and very strict deck building restrictions that do a great job of balancing the game for new players (even though the back log of cards is extensive). The cat & mouse and mind-games presented here are some of the best I've ever experienced in a game.

If you like card games, but don't want to buy hundreds and thousands of dollars on Magic: The Gathering, then this is probably a great pick for you, if you have a regular group to play with.

It doesn't tickle my particular fancy (I'm not overly in love with the theme, nor do I want to spend countless hours hypothesizing about the best way to build a deck), but it's good for what it is.

4 / 5 - Very Good

Theme emerging directly from the gameplay and a fine and unexpected marriage of bluffing and strategy. Would have been happier if starter decks were better. Review: http://fortressat.com/articles-boardgame-reviews/3674-android-netrunner-review

RATING: 8
A great card game for two players. Evenly balanced sides, I love the fact that you play with hidden cards as a corporation. Need to play a few more times to try out all the decks and also make my own to really get a feel of what the game's like. So far however, it's met all expectations. One thing that doesn't make it a 10 is that as a runner you can lose the game all of a sudden from net/meat damage. I'm sure this is because I haven't been playing it safe and because I'm new at it.

Amazing 2-player game. Hidden information with lots of second guessing, hand management, action and resource economy all there with a very cool theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.59
Assume Cycles 1-4.

Rating:

Game quality: It loses a point because the LCG format rears its ugly head here more than it should compared to a game like The Star Wars: LCG or GoT: LCG. Each of those have definite entry points into the LCG and at places to expand. A:N you just kind of pick a spot and go with it while never being fully right or wrong. My best advice is 1-2 Core sets(lean on two), 3 data packs, and C&C. What three data packs is up to you. Research StimHack for deck ideas before deciding. You don't have to buy everything, but it will benefit you to at least do your homework.

Post first couple of plays via starter decks. Don't judge it after plays with starter decks. Those first plays were rather uneven. Play around with other runners and corporations and then go from there. As a base game so far, 8. 

Would I buy this again if I was starting over: Way too early as I think the system can only be judged once you get expansions and start building some decks that are worthwhile. 5.

Do I want to play this if asked: Always until I at least get a better feel. I still think this will remain high as my chances to play it still remain on the low side. 9.

Overall: 8.59

Rating potential: I repeat, way too early. This can only go up over time unless it really falls apart for me, and I don't see that happening. I've done the CCG thing more than once so I know what I'm getting into. Additional plays put this higher.

I bought this game thinking it would be a fun two player game to add to my collection given the reviews I have heard. I give it a low rating not because its bad, but because it's a lifestyle game.

If you enjoy lifestyle games or ccg's like magic but are looking for something different, this might be for you.

My favorite of the LCG's from FFG.  I love the bluffing aspect of it, the assymetric sides and win conditions, and the fact that a game is never over until the last agenda is scored/stolen.  With that said,  played it too the point where I got a little burned out, and for competitive play, I think there are only certain decks (some of which are not very fun to play or play against) that you can realistically win with.  Still love it, regardless.  (Obviously I haven't kept my # of plays up to date, I think I have probably played this 100 times or more).

Unless Nate is reading this, then I have only played a couple of times and am still learning the game.

I don't like being attacked, so I play as the runner.  I'm also not into deckbuilding, so I just play decks that my partner puts together.

What I like:
- There's a tableau building aspect where you build up your tools and defense
- Some money management aspects too as you need some sort of money engine to be able to run effectively
- Huge variety of cards and strategies
- Each faction has a different feel so you can pick factions that match your type of play style.

What I don't like:
- It's stressful trying to decide which server to run on and the potential consequences of the ice and traps you may encounter

I did the asymmetrical nature of this game. Compared to my admittedly outdated experience with MTG the bluff aspect adds more opportunity for player vs player mind games. The expansions have done a nice job of adding to the game without unbalancing it. Overall I like the LCG model. The only CCG I've had more fun with was Bloodwars because of its multiplayer aspect.

The worst thing about Netrunner is trying to find local players.

Easily my favourite tabletop game. Asymmetric play, the corps moves all being hidden and brilliant card design to boot. Lots of expansions to give you more ways to play.

Looking forward to my copy of Terminal Directive arriving which introduces narrative play, not sure how that would work but very eager to find out.

*Update*

Okay, so I'm starting to enjoy this game after playing it a few times. I will not change my stance on the theme, it still does not do much for me, but I do enjoy the bit of bluffing that comes built into the game. 

I may consider getting my own set.

My continued knock on the game is that it is an investment of time and energy. You are not going to be able to say to someone who's never played before, "Hey, want to play Netrunner?", and expect it to go well.

RATING: 7.8
First few plays against an inexperienced player (I was too, but I was prepared). I won all three (2 times as corp, one time as runner). The first time was a flatline due to a trap, the other was 7 agenda points for the corp, but I postponed it just to get my opponent to run (he was scared because of the flatline earlier). And as a runner I scored 7 points, but the corp did well. Slowly building it up: my opponent wants revenge! :) As a runner you really feel the thrill and I love the theme.

Edit: I love the art and theme and the gameplay. The only drawback is the deckbuilding: the only reason for me why this games stays at an 8 (I just don't have enough patience, time and playtime to build and test decks).

Edit2: The game becomes too 'big' for me. Too much expansions, etc. *CG's are not for me. I'll keep my Netrunner 'collection', though, but I won't be expanding it beyond the 2nd cycle.

This game is a very good 2 player experience and better if the theme appeals to you, not my case too much, MTG is still my favorite Garfierld's game.

I'd buy and play Netrunner if the spanish Edge editions were available at good prices here in Colombia.

RATING: 1
I gave it a fair shot. I used to play Overpower, Magic, Pokemon, and Yugioh, as well as plenty of other games, so it's fair to say I understand how customizable card games generally work. The rule book is super difficult to understand, but I'm pretty sure we played it as intended (took a long time for the first couple of games).

It feels like there's way more stuff in the game than there needs to be. It might be fun if it were streamlined. But it's not, and it's not.

The runner died on his first turn during one of the games I played.

This game is pretty fantastic.  Right now, we are not worried at all with the deck building aspect but rather simply playing it out of the box.  If you are familiar with MTG, this will start playing itself by the second game.  

Truly, each of the seven factions play completely differently.  It's pretty amazing in that way.

The rules are brutal, fiddly, layered and remorselessly obscure. Everything is key-worded and each card has 12+ pieces of information on it. It's a teenage boys' game, but it's a very well executed one. I wouldn't go near a tournament for this.

I have only played a couple times, both as the corporation, but found this game quite fascinating. I know there is enormous depth here. Though the learning curve is a bit steep due to lots of terminology, the gameplay itself is not that complicated. Would love to try this one out more in the future.

RATING: N/A
I need more practice at this because I really don't get it so far. It feels limited (in terms of what you can achieve, not in terms of scope) and mechanical. I am unable to feel any sense of immersion so far, and I know that this is not the experience of many, so it may just be me. I've not had opportunity to really understand the game yet, so I'll keep ploughing on because I really want it to be as great as its press.

My first foray into any type of LCG, and the choice was a good one. I've been interested in NR for years and was thinking about doing a PnP version of the old WotC version just to play, and FFG came in with their awesome re-imagining/reissue. Got my (1) copy Saturday at GenCon 2012, learned how to play in a day, and was in the tournament that night. Came in the bottom 3rd of 56 people, and lost a few games pretty badly (scoring 2 or less), but I had a lot of fun and I'm sticking with it.

RATING: 5
As a long-time MTG player, I was intrigued but sceptical of this - I just assumed that this was Magic re-themed and with the LCG model as opposed to the CCG one, and therefore more palatable for the anti-Magic crowd. I was wrong.

This is a great and intriguing card game heavy on bluffing, playing the odds, and walking a tightrope. The 7 agenda points (researched by the Corporation player or stolen by the hacker) or flatline (the Corporation player forcing the hacker to discard cards they don't have) to win makes the game much more volatile than the sometimes drawn-out games of MTG (especially in control or midrange matchups). Here, while things can take a long time, and you play for incremental advantage (typically through improving your economy, and defences/offensive capabilities as a corp/runner respetcively) similar to MTG, when you steal a 3 point agenda you are suddenly half-way to winning. Even the hardest fortress, with pile upon pile of ICE (defensive cards played by the corporation), can unravel at the hands of the Runner by something completely unforseen, a weak spot, a bluff that was called. Alternatively the runner can think themselves safe, with a massive pile of programs and money only to be lured into the perfect trap and suddenly be dead in the water. A game where at least it feels like nothing is ever completely set until the last point is scored (though it often is).

I really like it, and the packs and deluxe expansions are always there tempting me, but I'm not buying into this, I know it for the trap it is - I just don't have anyone to play with, to share my obsessive nature when it comes to games like this. I don't have the time or desire to go play at my LFGS, and I don't have friends who are willing to invest themselves like me in - so no, I won't go down this road even though I might want to.

Even so, I have the core set. It's fun, but I know it's just an appetizer to what the "full" thing would be so I ultimately prefer other games for the same settings as I'd play this.

A good, even great, game but I'm not going down this ICE filled rabbit hole - I'm taking the blue pill this time

RATING: 9
An excellent two player, cyberpunk  game with asymmetric play. One player plays a megacoproration and the other a runner (a computer hacker) who has to infiltrate the corporation network.

There are 4 different corporations and 3 different runner decks and they all play differently, so this one is not going to get boring fast.

I've revisited the game after some away time, and now that there are a TON of cards available. The pace that cards are released while still managing a balance is amazing. The game is really awesome, well deserving of it's ranking here, and I'll bump up from a 7 to a 9. It's a difficult game to break through the new player level on but that's not always a bad thing.

I do not recommend Jinteki personally to start learning how to play Corp side. I got rather frustrated trying to do such with the pre-made decks.(We own 1 core) Lesson learned try each of them out and don't use strategies learned in other CCG's. The play is a good bit different than Magic or L5R. Once you learn to be more patient and play reflexively it's more enjoyable. In the end, HB fit me the best. I've yet to try the runner side, my fiance is happily taking his turn still.

Played a lot. I think the many extensions are not a good point: hard to get new players (must buy all extensions), and I think the power of cards increases slightly with extension. Not a good move. 

I was hoping for new identity extensions: a game where you're not obliged to pay to keep the level, but where you choose your prefered style of play.

RATING: 7
This is a very solid game that (unlike Call of Cthulhu) has a great meld of theme and mechanics. Where Cthulhu feels more like doing math problems, Android: Netrunner feels more like corporate espionage, hacking and whatnot. Maybe the runner is a little more fun to play--haven't quite decided yet--but it seems like a game with pretty good staying power. I'm just now getting to the point where I know the decks a little bit and can hope to begin developing some proficiencies. Ha, who am I kidding, I'm an idiot. I'll be content just playing and enjoying the game incompetently.

Buen juego, pero es el típico juego en el que necesitas al menos 2 cajas básicas y todas las expansiones que vayan saliendo para mantenerte vigente y con un mazo competitivo (que fue lo que me terminó por aburrir). El azar puede influir bastante en una partida. Lo recomiendo solo si están dispuestos a gastar una brutalidad de dinero. En lo personal prefiero otros juegos, pero de todas maneras recomiendo éste si te gusta participar de torneos y ligas.

We read the instructions and started our first game.  A lot of rifling through the instructions.  I like the heralded asymmetry so far!  I pulled off a bluff which made me feel so cool, although maybe a little sinister.  

Update 1:  Rating dropped 9.0->8.5.  Great card game with tons of variety in the box without adding any expansions.  In the end I just can't rate this as high as all of those overly fiddly too long Euro style games that we adore.

Update 2:  I always play the Corporation and my wife always plays the Runner until I win with all four Corporation decks.  Then I will get to play as the runner and that will be so mind bending, no more suit and tie!  Its down to needing to win with Jinteki.  I get the feeling that Jinteki and I are going to have a long happy relationship together based on my recent efforts.

Update 3:  Rating undropped from 8.5->9.0.  Oh fine, it deserves a 9.0.  I did finally win with Jinteki a while back, so I am getting to enjoy all of the Runner decks now.  What a blast! Plays way different then the corporation.  By far our most assymetric game.

An excellent asymmetric 2 player duel game but there are some things I kind of dislike:

It's really fun that you need to create one deck for both runner and corp sides.

Very balanced and exciting gameplay that is a bit marred by the bluffing/luck factor of running blindly.

With the concept of "LCG" so you don't need to buy random expansions, they force you to buy 3 copies of the core game in order to get every deck-building possibility. This is the most hypocritical thing I've seen in board games and it reduces the score by 1 full point for me.

Rating after one play with the 'beginner's decks' (see below; we cancelled the game after about 40 minutes by the way).

Well, while I could see some potential in the game (e.g. the bluffing element - however, this seems to only come with the cooperation decks...) our play was just utterly boring.

Both sides didn't have any useful actions to be done. The runner already owned 5 out of 7 points (quite at the beginning) but couldn't do any harm to the cooperation besides attacking his deck of unused cards (which didn't do any damage because the chance of getting points for it by having a card worth points on top of it is 1:5). So we drew money all the time, played useless cards (again, these were only available for the cooperation player because the runner had everything he needed already in play... so the runner could only get even more money and throw away some more cards...).

This might be pretty different in case you don't play the two decks which are recommended by the rulebook for your first play. Anyhow, I don't think I'll give it another try...

Great game if one can dedicate the time and focus.  Probably my favourite LCG/CCG game design, if only I had unlimited time and resources.

----------------------------------------------------------
Very good game and an excellent update/expansion by FFG of the original game.  

Good to see the rules kept mostly unchanged.  I like the idea of factions and special abilities as this change gives a game a richer thematic feel.

Don't quite like the new "anime" inspired artwork as much as the original, but at least the graphic design changes don't get in the way of playing the game and the game now has a consistent graphic look compared to the original game.

Card stock also doesn't feel as sturdy as the original, but won't matter much as I will be sleeving all my cards.

Very much looking forward to the expansions.

One of the best games I've ever played, and by far the best card game I've tried.

PROS
- Innovative theme in card games.
- Amazing theme-mechanics integration.
- Total assymmetry, this are almost two different games.
- Different win conditions that really feel different.
- Very high amount of archetypes which should be played in totally different ways.
- Great development of the Android setting.

CONS
- It requires a lot of time and dedication to play when your collection is large, as any game which demands deck creation and metagame observation.

RATING: 9
This game is very hard to get into. Rules are numerous and some aren’t used in every game, terminology is unique and somewhat hard to remember, rulebook is big and you’ll find yourself going back and forth many times. The first few games you’ll play will be slow and you’ll be fumbling around not knowing what to do.  But if you manage to get past the steep learning curve, you’re in for a treat.

The theme is excellent and excellently represented. The gameplay is actually a cyberpunk experience, where you actually feel like a determined hacker going against the rich corporation risking your life, or like a mighty corporation looking to protect its secrets and keep pesky hackers out. Playing is fun and calculated and cards have a strong impact, and that’s after me playing only two factions! 

It’s an excellent game that needs dedication to get into but it’s definitely worth it if you have the time to invest and friends to play at the same level as you.

Netrunner is the bees knees when it comes to two player games. It's deep, fast enough, easily modifiable, has great replay ability and a good theme.

I enjoyed the original version of this game, but I just haven't been able to get this to the table more than once or twice and I feel like I'm way too far behind now to get involved.  That's the problem with lifestyle games - and that's more or less what this is.

Did not turn out to be a great option for us. We are not that interested in actually collecting/building new decks, and the base game is somewhat limited. 

We don't tend to play a lot of direct conflict games, though this game does a good job of conflict without spitefulness.

I love this game, but I think that the best way to play it is in a large community of fans, like MTG players and so on... Otherwise it loses 90% of is potential: you have to found new strategies and combos to enjoy this game completely... And this means buying (or trying) all new card sets that get printed: isn't a game that you can play only sometimes.

A fun game with two very different sides that can be really quick. A lot of tension comes from not knowing what the corporation really has. Games can be tense, but only when going to the wire.

RATING: 8.8
I thoroughly enjoyed the theme and flavor of the game, and the asymmetrical play made it fun time and again to pull out.  Being a collector, I quick;y swooped up most of the expansions (as you will see below) - and never played them.  One consequence of never having a consistent set of people to game with means the expansions were never opened, and in fact the base game never got "drafted" for custom decks.  As a result of the "wasted" purchases, and also knowing that there are many other two-player games I prefer to both teach and to play, I only felt a bit of sorrow that I sold this ensemble.

In short: definitely worth checking out for people seeking a grand 2 player asymmetrical option... but be wary of the more professional players, as the experience is apparently cutthroat and not fun.

1. Start a game

3. Netrunner ---> Ebay

Played a couple of games, and I can see why some people love this game, but definitely not my cup of tea. There is way to much luck involved for my taste. The upper case was an extrem example with a very low chance, but the fact that it could happen is for me a sign of bad game design. Winning a game from 0 points to 100 % in one Action with pure luck is just horrible. And: compared to many other LCGs, this game is way more unforgiving if u start with a bad hand of cards. This game feels like a complex Pokergame with a cyberpunk-theme stolen from the RPG-Universe Shadowrun.

Netrunner itself is a phenomenal game; it's probably the best head-to-head card game I've ever played. However, I've found it harder and harder to keep up with the game (not that I was ever a competitive player or anything). Most of all, I don't love the work of building decks (either netdecking or custom decks). This brings the game down just a notch for me, as I'm more likely to want to play something that is ready to go out of the box.

I love the asymmetric game play and the different factions.  Each faction has it's own feel and flavor that make the game more interesting.  Slightly annoyed at the LCG business model FFG has going, releasing a couple good cards each data pack.  More than likely, the constant feeling of upkeep will take me out of the game more than anything...but as a stand-alone product, the game is very fun and quite enjoyable.

Update May 2014: Annnnnd NOW it's a hobby unto itself.  I spend altogether too much time thinking about deck builds and play strategies.  Not a universal recommendation, as it's most rewarding with a friend to learn alongside you.  That satisfied, this is the ticket.  A rich, malleable feast of mechanics and subsystems, with an inseparable dose of psychological fear-mongering.  "Diesel up and faceplant."  10.

Rating will likely improve--just starting to scratch the surface with this one, haven't yet built any decks--but the first half dozen games with the prebuilt factions have been enough to get its hooks firmly in.  With a similarly-competitive friend to get into this game alongside, could be a hobby unto itself.  Also the narratives it builds are great.  Might be a little too surgical and cold-blooded for couples, if they're anything like competitive.

I have some doubts with this one. 

I dig the theme a lot. It's unique. I like the asymmetrical sides as well. There is also a lot of guesswork and a fair amount of luck in the game as well. The runs on HQ and R&D are luck of the draw; the idea of using Ice as defense is interesting, as is the way the Corp player can put agendas and...other cards...face down to try to throw the Runner off. The different types of Ice and their corresponding Icebreakers seems like a bit of a crap shoot, at least with the base game. "Oh, he's got lots of Barrier Ice, I hope I have some Barrier Icebreakers....looks like those Sentry Icebreakers are useless this time."

I know that part of building a well-rounded deck is having an attack plan for anything you happen to face, and I think part of the limiting feeling comes from the small pool of cards from which to build. The base set is almost a preview of the full game, and the full game is base + expansions.

My major issue with the game is that it's sort of a lifestyle game; it's going to be at its best when played frequently, and against the same opponent(s) if possible. Building decks and battling someone, learning their tendencies, bluffing and suckering, etc. I don't have the time to devote this much attention to a single game, which makes me iffy about the game. 

Ultimately, I think Netrunner may be a very good game, but a poor fit for me at this point in my life.

What an amazing game this is. Complete and utter integration of theme, a dense metagame that is focused on reading, predicting, and responding to one's opponent, and not merely one's opponent's deck, and a rich, web-like, tactical layer that requires intense concentration, patience, and a sense of not only hand management but timing. The more I play it, the more I want to play it.

Csodás játék. Nem véletlen van előkelő helyen.
Alapvetően nem szeretem a gyűjtögetős játékokat, de maga a téma nagyon megtetszett. Aztán játszottunk vele egyet. Meg még egyet. Meg még egyet... és így tovább :)
Amilyen hosszúnak tűnik a szabály, igazából annyira egyszerű, értelmesebb emberrel hamar meg lehet értetni.

Van benne egy olyan nehézség, hogy minden kis résznek van külön elnevezése, pl az eldobott paklik nem eldobott paklik, hanem archive, a kezedben lévő kártyák HQ és ez ráadásul különbözik a cégnél és a runnernél is. De igazából ez a témát akarja csak jobban előtérbe hozni, szóval nincs vele baj.

Nekem nagyon tetszik az alap készlet is (más még nincs), rengeteg az újrajátszhatóság benne, a random tökéletesen bele illik a mechanikába, és ezért az árért... tökéletes vétel volt!

This game is becoming a quick favorite. Netrunner is one of the most thematic card games to come along in a long time. It feels like what it purports to be- runners raiding servers at great risk, while corporations desperately try to defend themselves, punish the runners, and push their agendas forward. The asymmetrical nature of the game calls for a change of mindset for playing each side, but the better you become at one the more you know how to play the other. Since I am a part of a growing base of players in my area, the game has also provided a great gaming group experience as well.

RATING: 9.4
Netrunner is a great, complex 2-player game.  While a lot of 2P games are just battle tactics, Netrunner adds in some euro-game elements: as a corp, you have to build up protected servers; as the runner, you need to create a good economic engine.  The wide diversity of cards and factions and the asymetrical game makes each game feel different.

I have 30 data packs (up to Business First).

The mechanics of this game are superb and the asynchronous play really adds an incredible depth. That and the cyberpunk theme are what drew me to it. The backstory is rich and all the playable characters have identifiable styles.

I don't know if metagame is a valid point when reviewing, but that's really the only issue with it. Like every other game, serious play tends to distill a game down to its essential parts and with Netrunner, that has (in the past) created a boring metagame. But that's really only for tournament play which I think the majority of people don't participate in.

RATING: 8
Incredibly good 2-players, pure asymmetrical card game. Cyberpunk theme is everywhere - in the original ENGLISH version (ICE is an acronym, not the solid state of water... poor italian translation...).
No other game gives you the thrill of a good run on a hugely guarded server, or a good bluff to fry the hacker's brain; the only con I can think of is that it requires a good deck preparation but hey, it's a struggle for the fittest isn't it?!

Buy it, play it, love it. In english. A shining diamond and a very good FFG reboot of an old classic.

Apart from go, this is the game I have played the most times. I stopped logging plays quickly...

I love this game, even though I haven't played it in a long while. I love (almost) everything about it: the interplay of theme and mechanics; the cards' art and text; the never-ending evolution of the rules.

It's easier to list the 2 things I dislike about it: the game is usually not played with a clock, perhaps because the flow of the game makes that impractical (the opponent often has actions available during your turn); more importantly, the rules and cards' writing is unbelievably sloppy.

Great strategic two player game. I was really interested in the concept of an asymmetrical 1v1 LCG, but I never found the time really give it the attention it needs. With how fast new data packs come out with how much I actually played I was finding it hard to keep up.

Pep: Muy buen juego pero para nada apto a todos los públicos, con una temática muy bien implementada. Complejo de aprender y al ser un LCG, prácticamente infinito. El problema que tiene este juego es que es más que un juego. Es decir, se necesita mucha implicación, tiempo, dinero... Como dicen muchos, es un "metajuego". La asimetría le da un plus y originalidad. Un gran juego, que difícilmente verá mesa :(

Nany: De acuerdo a lo de la temática y lo de la complejidad. Este juego, lo adquirimos con mucha ilusión, pero a mí particularmente no me ha entrado. Considero que es un juego que sólo disfrutas cuando ya lo tienes dominado, y para eso hay que jugar muuchas veces. Es muy complejo de aprender y de interiorizar las reglas. Personalmente no me gustan los juegos que requieren tanta dedicación para poder disfrutarlos.

I cannot say enough about this game. The theme is excellent but the game play is even better. If you enjoy bluffing and trying to get inside the head of your opponent this is the game to get. 

Asymmetrical game play gives each side a very distinct feeling and caters perfectly to different play styles.   

The cards in your deck are important but how you play is probably more important. We'll have to see how Netrunner develops over the long haul but so far I much prefer it over Magic The Gathering. 

The best part is that as a LCG it is no longer about who can spend the most to build their deck.

Regarding the Core set only - Traces/Bad Publicity, and especially Brain Damage seem pretty under utilized and some of the factions are better than others but future expansions will likely alleviate these issues.

If you do not want to start collecting cards and/or get involved in deck building I still highly recommend picking up the core set. It is a fantastic game right out of the box even with my minor quips.

RATING: 10
After about 10 games now, A:NR is now my favourite 2-player game. 

Each session is done in about 30-40 minutes, allowing 2-3 sessions to be played inside 90 minutes. Aside from deckbuilding, which really should be done prior to a game session, set up and break down is also very quick.

The pros:
- The main appeal of the game is the bluff and second guessing between runner and corporation; 
- The factions each have completely different resources and options which mix and match to create asymmetric sessions that are different and sometimes surprising results;
- The runner and corporation also play very differently, adding to the variety of experience and appreciation for each side's available strategies and tactics in response to the other player's resources. The expansions widen this experience and promise some great metagame; and
- the base game sets and expansions are relatively cheap, and each expansion is purely optional depending on player tastes.

The cons:
- its only two-player (in its current form) so other LCGs that permit multiplayer will usually be preferred;
- the game's significant nomenclature isn't there just to add theme and is necessary to the specific rule set, which steepens the learning curve;
- its prone to some analysis paralysis-related downtime, especially for the corporation player while they plan and execute their ice and asset placements. This should reduce to a large degree through experience with the game;
- in addition to the above, the structure of the game is highly specific and fiddly but important to get right, significantly adding to the learning curve. I've often missed or forgotten to play rules in my early games;
- added to the above two, like many LCGs/CCGs, the cards "break" the rules, often requiring frequent reference to FAQs and card rulings;
- like most card games, a player's card draws can start very poorly or spectacularly well. The game mechanisms, as well as deck tuning and mulligan, does reduce this problem to some degree; and
- custom deck building requires at least two core sets, and possibly a third if a player wants to include 3 unique cards into a custom decks. This isn't a major issue because A:NR is not nearly as expensive for a player to build decks as compared to, for example, Magic:the Gathering.


>>minor update. I'm still really enjoying this brilliant game but the need to frequently check rules in the poorly organised rulebook and FAQ is persistent and a bit annoying.

Being a LCG it has its perk (for me) that you get out of competitive play if you dont buy all the expansions that are out there for your factions.

Fun, thematic game.  The core set is good for awhile, but after a few games you'll start picking up on cards that are kind of stinky and wishing you could streamline your strategy a bit more.  

Even if you aren't interested in expansions or building you own decks, I'd definitely still say this one is worth buying.

I own 2 core sets and all of the Genesis Cycle and Spin Cycle.  I think my collecting days are over, however.  I only really play this game with one friend, and it's not worth the constant investment to keep up with the new releases.  I've got enough cards to last me forever.

RATING: 9
A re-imagining of a game far ahead of its time. While the idea of cyberspace has mostly become ubiquitous and far different than even the makers of Max Headroom could have imagined, this game stays true to its cyberpunk roots through the Android setting Fantasy Flight Games has built. This asymmetrical game is something that won't make a lot of sense at first, but it will come to be a competitive game in ways most players aren't prepared for.

I like this game a lot.
Nice theme, nice components, assymetric gameplay.

Sometimes randomly, but accurate in long term.
Enjoy playing core set (i only have it) with prebuild decks.

Played only Jinteki, like it.
My GF plays Shaper, she also like to be Runner (i feel more like corp).

We are still playing core set, with Jinteki-Shaper.
I didn't even play runner yet, but still like the game!!!

In the CCG design world, you're trying to increase the design space for hundreds of interesting cards while avoiding adding complexity; but given the choice, you'd rather get both complexity and design space than none of them. Well Netrunner has a lot of both and I can recognise the good in its core design, but it really requires you to have a dedicated group of players; because amongst all the TCG/CCG/LCG games I've come across, it has the highest entry barrier of all. Not because of some inherent complexity, but because knowledge about the opponent's deck (or, at a larger scale, the metagame) is a way bigger egde than in other games. That makes it absolutely terrible for both pick-up-and-play (where a newbie will be clueless) and deckbuilding on a whim (because some cards will simply be dead against a given meta). Probably a great lifestyle game, but I'm not willing to put the investment to get enjoyment out of it.

Also boo to FFG who managed to take a fairly accessible ruleset (once you're past the nerdy cyberpunk vocable) and make the cards harder to decipher than they should by applying a different but always busy-looking template for each card type.

They ruined my experience with this game by printing too many powerful cards and rotating out cards that they said would never rotate out (which should have made them a safe buy for the player who doesn't want to invest too much).

Base game is great but expansions and meta ruin the game.

A very strong card game, I'd say it's one of the best. I really enjoy the variety of options available on each turn and the bluffing element of the game. It feels much more like a battle of wits compared to other card games such as Magic: The Gathering.

However, just like Magic, it requires a commitment from each player before they can fully enjoy the game. You need to be aware of the cards the opponent might have in the deck. You also should ideally make your own decks. This means it's not a game to pull out and teach a casually interested player, it's something you play for an extended period and learn to love over time.

RATING: 7
Leki's copy - not as good as Star Wars or LOTR: LCG, hard to see what the fuss is about tbh.  Really abstracted/squeezed in thematic mechanics "you have to hack my hand/deck/discard pile/cards in play" that even when you've played a few times just don't seem to make sense.
Not a bad game, but if I didn't play again I honestly wouldn't mind.

An inferior LCG. Silly how you need two base sets to really start doing any deck building and really silly how people think it is somehow different from much better CCG card games when it really is not--card chasing will become the norm and those that think you can "just play it out of the box" are fooling themselves as they encounter more serious players.  Gameplay is largely luck based on how you draw your cards and and when.  The luck of hitting random agendas on runs or not and decisions are overly simple and straight forward....The rulebook gets a 3 out of 10 rating and is horrible compared to most games.  The base set decks are inadequate and poorly designed with too little variety in transactions and resources for my taste. Much better games out there.  My friends are all playing so got roped in and will play along for now.....theme is somewhat interesting and keeps this from being lower.

I LOVE THIS GAME.  My only wish is that I had more opponents in my local area so that I could play in face to face games or try to get to a tournament.  Oh well OCTGN will have to suffice for now.  The intricacies of playing both sides and the differences between the two leads to endless amounts of fun.  Deck building takes it to a whole nother level, I love looking at cards people hate using and testing them out trying to figure out ways to make them work and building different decks for every identity.  One day maybe I can play competitively, here's hoping.

FFG have done a very nice job of the rerelease. Excellent deep game, with astonishingly thoroughgoing asymmetry.

One hope: please come out with a box of three more copies of each Corporation neutral card and two of each Runner neutral card, so we can just have the seven base box decks ready to roll, without having to sort through each time we want to change decks?

RATING: 7
Very different from anything else I own, and from that perspective I'm really glad I have it. It's a fun, quick, thematic good time with a fair amount of interesting decision making. It's fatal flaw is also part of the fun - the blind element. The runner could make the exact same choice and it may win him the game or lose him the game, through no real fault of his own. This prevents Netrunner from being truly great, but then again, I don't think it was ever intended to be. I will probably be getting several expansions to this over time, which means it must be fun enough to warrant it!

RATING: 7
In this 2 player card game, one player is the Corporation attempting to protect it's assets, while the other player is a "Runner" attempting to cyber attack into the Corporation. The Corporation places "ice" protection on the draw deck, servers and hand. In the servers can be placed agendas which are worth VPs, or ambushes. 

The runner attempts to make "runs" at the Corporation, to either score Agendas, or make the Corporation run out of cards. When you run, the runner reveals the ice and/or agendas. Since the cards are hidden, there is bluffing involved.  If the runner hits an ambush card, they can suffer damage.

On a player's turn, they can use actions to draw cards, play cards or earn credit, and in the runner's case, make a run.

The game seems alright after one playing, and I'm looking forward to trying out the other decks.

I was disappointed with this as it gets some great reviews. I've only played 7-8 times, all with the starter decks, and found it a bit frustrating. Not interested in buying all the cards and the tournament scene, so it's firmly behind one-box card games like Race for the Galaxy for me.

I hate building decks. Hate it. Absolutely hate it. This is the one exception and even then I have to get motivated to do it. The things that keep me coming back are the deep game play, wonderful theme, and the asymmetrical game play.

Card game, asymmetric player powers: Corporation versus Hacker.

Took a while to get through the rules, which ditch the generic terms (such as draw deck, discard pile, etc.) for more thematic terms. It is a bit problematic when learning the game from the rule book.

Have yet to play. The cyberpunk theme in a dystopian future setting is not for everyone.

This game was a mystery to me.

Not the game itself, rather why I did not enjoy it was a mystery.

I love deck builders, I love the cyber punk theme. I loved laying down ice. I loved the bluffing and trying to outsmart my opponent. I love card games. The cards looked beautiful. I love the concept of the game and everything about the game.

However, for some reason that I cannot explain, I just did not enjoy this game, and I tried many, many times to enjoy it with several different people.

It is hard to rate a game when I do not even know why I don't like it, but I ranked it how I feel none the less.  I kind of sound like my wife: Having feelings but not being able to explain them, but that is Android: Netrunner for me.

Extremely fun deck building game that is fast, fresh and highly strategic. Has the best asymmetrical gameplay I have encountered; Netrunner (hacker) vs Corporation. The theme works really well and is executed perfectly. 

I recommend having someone who likes the game teach you for first play, as the rule book and terminology used is not as intuitive as it should be. This can HEAVILY influence your impression of the game. Especially if you are playing the game incorrectly. 

2012: Rated ~2. "What is going on in this stupid game". 
2014: Rated 8.5. After being taught by an enthusiastic player (also purchased the game immediately afterwards!). 
2014: Rated 9.5. More plays, its fast, fun and cant wait until the next game. Want to buy the expansions, but don't feel it is that necessary either: there is a lot of game play in one core set and the first cycle (Genesis) would add more than enough for my gaming group.  

Cons:
-Envisage that competitive play may be hard without owning every card available.
-Its a living card game: aka money siphon. But on the bright side its much more economically feasible that MTG.

A remarkably thematic asymmetrical card game, with a good amount of replay-ability and an interesting collection of mechanics. 

It is admittedly reliant on at least some expansion cards for long term shelf life, but with each pack of cards being fixed (players can easily check each packs card list before purchase) that is far more tempting and justifiable than the old collectible format. I would recommend the deluxe boxed expansions, with other data packs added as desired for flavor/completeness.

An excellent game, especially with a few add-ons to keep deck construction variety high.

We played a few times this game. For now, we don't find this very challenging. Perhaps we don't yet have understand the substance of the game. I think this is more a strategical than a tactical game.

This is the first collectible (living) card game I've ever stuck with, and I don't imagine I'll stop anytime soon.  The assymetrical play between the corps and the runner makes for really interesting matches, and I love the bluffing/double bluffing element to it.  I'm enjoying building decks, and I'm always leaving games thinking of what I could have done better both in the deck construction or in the play itself.  Really really fun.

Android: Netrunner is a near perfect game in my opinion. It's truly amazing the way it integrates traditional CCG style card play with economy management and even adds in a bit of bluffing. On top of that it covers all of this in a wonderful theme that feels 100% natural to the game. Android: Netrunner could not possibly be about anything else.

The only thing keeping this from a perfect 10 is that all of these things that make it so wonderful also make it quite a chore to teach and keep up with. An interesting caveat but a caveat nonetheless.

I really don't understand the hype about this game. It looks cool, I give 10/10 for the theme and artwork. When I first played this game, I wanted to like it.

In the end it's all about bluffing and deck building and stressing credit management which drains your game totally if you don't get the right cards at the right moment. Maybe I had a bad deck but still.

Pros:
- Awesome art and theme!
- Thrilling gameplay because you don't know the opponent's next move or see their cards (and you really want to)
- Very dynamic because of the different corporations and runners. Great replay value.

Cons:
- Terminology. Heap, Grip, rezzed ice... really? I'm a programmer and a computer nerd by profession, still these terms feel stupid and confusing.
- CCG. To me that's a downer.
- This game is too hardcore. You can't ask your wife or some random friend to play this. You really need to be into this, building decks and going through your cards. You have to own it, expand it.
- Resource management is a bottleneck. If you have bad luck with the cards you can't do nothing. You spend all your "clicks" or actions to get credits to do stuff. Boring. Not fun.
- The gab between more experienced player and a beginner is HUGE. I have read this elsewhere and agree. This is a game for hardcore fans.

Very thematic and very aesthetically pleasant.

Not only do Corporation and Runner decks function very differently; Identities within the two opposing factions feel different when playing.

I can clearly see why this is so well regarded.

Unfortunately, I don't necessarily like the economy flow, where you have to build many credits, then use them on an educated guess and have to rebuild them again.  I think that slows down things a bit and yes, it contributes to the uniqueness of the game and tension of runner vs company, but it's not enjoyable to me.

I just don't like Android: Netrunner. Its LCG nature makes for the possibility of enthusiasts being able to make powerful decks capable of crushing new players. Plus, A:N's confusing nomenclature makes it really difficult to introduce to first-timers. I like the sci-fi theme, but find the game dull.

They hit the theme perfectly in this game, with the bluffing and the cards played face down. I liked the game, like the theme, but can only afford or have time for a single LCG, which will remain Invasion. The different styles of play between players is also cool. Two decks for tournaments though is a down side.

I don't get why this game is so popular. Also, is it possible to learn this game solely from the manual? Some manuals are hard to understand because they're poorly translated; others because they are poorly organized. This one confounds for a novel reason: it starts out as though the reader is intimately familiar with the world the game inhabits and knows what "ice" is. No, not frozen water, but rather a stackable layer of protection. So very thematic, but come again?

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
My favorite CCG of the post-MtG era gets the FFG Royal Treatment: Significantly improved artwork, balanced-ish factions with deckbuilding potential, the LCG model instead of digging through packs of boosters for rares.  Almost every change from the older version has been a smart one, from reworking the trace and bad publicity mechanics to OOBE decks and a well-designed backstory tied to their Android universe.

And as predicted, the claustrophobic nature of the core set has been significantly reduced by the expansion packs.  This game broke the BGG Top 10 for a reason, folks.  It's the best reprint of 2012 and my happiest surprise.

2017 UPDATE: There is currently a LOT of noise around the lack of dominant strategies in the game, and how certain identities appear empirically better than others.  It might apply to the tournament scene where consistent identities are required for competition, but as a PvP experience without the scene it's still one of my Top 5 game designs of all time because it actively encourages experimentation... precisely because those so-called dominant strategies are so high-risk/high-reward that a single well-timed play can destroy an otherwise bulletproof strategy.  The only reason I'm not rating this a 10 is the learning curve for new people is obscenely steep.

RATING: 9
I love the theme, like the artwork, and most of the mechanics.

The theme has been well captured in the game play.

Artwork is fantastic.  Card layout/design is really poor.  It is difficult to identify card factions and stats.  My main complaint is with the ice cards - the layout totally differs from the other cards.

The head-to-head nature reminds me of BattleLine, which is still one of the most intense games I've played.

If you read my comments before, yes I have changed my mind radically.  While reading about the tournament rules, I realized I had been playing one thing incorrectly (I was not paying credits for existing ice when installing additional ice).  So I decided to try again.

In my last 5 games, I have come to realize how good this game is.  I discovered a handful of misplayed rules that mostly favored the corporation.  I think the additive power of that created a totally lopsided effect that removed the fun.  Wish I had a standing partner with whom I could play.

After continued play:
Corp seems to have the edge.  As Runner can only trash certain cards, that reduces the benefit of multiple runs on either HQ or R&D. And that restricts viable options.
After further play:
Runners now seem to have the advantage.  Not sure if I'm getting the hang of Runner, am naturally inclined, or not playing Corporate correctly.  Tried tuning a Corp deck and it worked as expected and should (a tuned deck should be able to handle a non-tuned out of the box one)

This has been my worst ever game for missing rules.  I have had almost no trouble with CCG's in the past.  Almost every interpretation I had for LoTR LCG were spot on in the FAQ.  I am usually pretty decent.  But this game has absolutely eaten my lunch.

Why this is not a 10:
-> Cannot effectively evaluate whether I would play this all the time as it is not solo.

I'm less enthused about this LCG than I thought I would be. I really wanted to like it, but it never seems to hit the high notes that it promises.

In particular, the amount of deception and mindgames in play is far less important than advertised; one imagines the corp laying down a web of remote servers, protected by varying levels of ice, and the runner having to mind-read to find the correct one. In practice, it just ends up as either a bunch of identical unprotected servers (random guessing) or two asymmetrical ones, one of which is promptly exposed, which obviates all need for guessing.

To make matters worse, it is vital to get a good balance of several kinds of cards (for the runner, icebreakers and resources; for the corp, agendas, ice, and assets). This creates the same problems as good old mana screw in Magic, but on an even worse scale.

The jargon, particularly for the various zones, is annoying and I constantly forget it. There's not much of a sense of building in scale either.

For me, this game doesn't come close to Magic.

Update: I've played a lot more now and I enjoy and understand the game much more. It's not so bad... but the criticisms above still stand. In addition, cardpool knowledge is very important in order to play half-decently.

I enjoy this one quiet a bit - which is already rare for card duelling games, but I simply really like the asymmetry of this one. 
What keeps this from an even better rating for me, is that I'm simply not made for these almost "lifestyle" games with lots of deckbuilding between games, otherwise this might be my go-to game for that. Without that it's still nice playing once in a while.

The setting is WONDERFUL, finally a good working game with a Cyberpunk setting and with a hacking system which works. Game is pleasant to play and easy to learn. 
However, unfortunately, this *IS* like an asymmetrical Magic! The fact that cards are not sold randomly does not change the feeling so much: if you do not continuously buy cards and if you do not have a group of people doing the same, it will end up into a drawer exactly like the old Magic cards. It is rather difficult to involve another player into playing it, from a tactical/strategical point of view there are better two players games.

Whilt Magic the Gathering was 80% deck building and only 20% actual decision making during games, this is the other way around. Therefore - for me - much more interesting nowadays.

Andoid Netrunner est vraiment LE jeu d'affrontement de cartes ultimes. Pour ceux qui ont aimé Magic, c'est comme Magic mais sans les mauvais côté : pas de booster en priant d'avoir les bonnes rares, vous savez déjà quelles cartes sont dans les paquets. Il y a un très bon équilibre, on sent que le jeu ne s'éparpille pas et demande pas mal de stratégie et de réflexion. Le facteur chance est également, selon moi, amoindri ou tout du moins on peut plus facilement le gérer. Un incontournable à posséder absolument :-)

Preliminary rating based on first play. Accessible rules (but a TERRIBLE rule book, again!). Entertaining. Thematic.

That creates frustation to a certain degree.

An interesting and different 2 player card game. It is essentially a game of risk management and having the best economy to either sustain your attack on the servers or raising the defenses. The game has bluffing, but it's quite superficial and that's OK. After repeated plays you see through the fact that a lot of cards are played face down, and realize that your actions are actually much more open to you that you first thought.

The more you play the game the paint you scratch of the surface into the inner workings of the system. And it's a really good system! Of course the game is sustained by the constant release of new cards which make the game much more wide than deep. It's IMO still a deeper, richer experience than playing Magic: The Gathering.

The aesthetics are just incredible and the mechanics are clever and satisfying too, but the buy-in and sustained commitment required is too high for a game that also demands at least one equal partner (and ideally several).

This game deserves its love.
You'll fear your enemy as you never know what he's up to.

There is room to do a lot in this little gem which takes 30-45 minutes to play. And a lot of factions which focus on its own kind of thing.

I wish it could be just a few boxes, similar to Dominion, so you can just take it and play. It would narrow down the number of strategies but will deliver a good experience for a wider player base.
Nonetheless the core box has a lot of gameplay in it.

The rules are heavy, don't be fooled, there is a lot of timing in the rules to be learnt (when you can/can't do solmething) and will need around 4-5 to learn the gameplay perfectly. 
Furthermore, the card pool has to be learnt as well, so you know what to expect from your deck and your opponent's deck.
Thus, high steep learning curve.

Wow! I played many ccgs back in the day but missed this one.  So happy I got a second chance on the rerelease with an improved format (lcg).  The asymmetry is great, I feel like I have the disadvantage no matter which side I am playing.  The out of box variety is superb for having so few cards, and the corps/factions all play differently.  So far I am loving the deck building and the amount of strategy when playing.  This game seems very likely to end up a 9 or 10.  Very excited to log a lot more plays and for the expansions.

Edit: Did not update to a 10 for over a year after it deserved it.  The best LCG/CCG easily, but it is more than that.  It is simply the best game ever made.

This is not just another game. It is an incredibly intricate and nuanced dance. Its player asymmetry and unique mechanics offer a great blend between long term strategy, short term tactical moves, some pure good-old bluffing and a degree of luck that is just right to always keep you on your toes. I've been playing this game intensively for over two and a half years and I keep finding new ways of approaching both individual cards and the game as a whole. You can make it as complicated (and personalized) as you like by going deep into the deck-building aspect of the game, or you can simply pick up a pre-built deck and still find infinite different ways to approach it. Oh, and it also has one of the best implementations of theme ever. Basically, its really good is what I'm saying here.

I've only played with the starter packs and that gives a very satisfactory game by itself, without having to delve into money-pit mode to buy more cards. It's a wonderful 2 player game for gamers. Rules complexity is high and a barrier to entry, but if you can get an opponent into it with you, there's a wonderful asymmetric struggle in store. There's bluff, there's surprise, there's multiple approaches, there's the luck of the cards, there's the hard decisions each turn on where and what to invest in. I'm not into the deck building thing as a rule, so I'd be content with what the starter set provides given it provides multiple factions to try out, which is more than the original did.

RATING: 7
I fell in love with this game when I started reading the rules. Asymmetric gameplay, no card rarity and the theme are quite attractive to me. I first rated this game 9... after a few games 8... now that I've explored and made my own deck out of all the current cards (free online)... 7... I had forgotten why I didn't play TCGs. I fucking hate losing because of bad draws.

I like to play Corp (Haas-Bioroid especially). In my opinion, there's a frustrating disadvantage to playing defence here: you're stuck having to draw those damn agendas. I don't know how many times I lost because all I was drawing was agendas. Nor can I count how many times I won or lost depending on which card was randomly accessed from my hq (hand) or r&d (deck) by the opposing hacker's attack.

Don't get me wrong, it's a good game. If you're into TCGs and you don't mind luck as a factor in games then it's a great game, go for it. When you have a tight game it's awesome. Hell the inconsistent frequency of that reward, never knowing when you're going to get it, is quite addicting. But if you're like me and you absolutely hate feeling powerless, save yourself hundreds of dollars and hours. Too many times, in my opinion, do players win just because of luck.

I'd still play but I'm not buying more cards.

Hype purchase. Big mistake. When will I learn to avoid BGG rankings? I give myself a '1' for that. The game also gets a '1'. Huge box filled with air. Requires expansions, requires deckbuilding, requires interest in the theme. Could not get one person interested in playing due to the extremely narrow and dry theme. Might be a good game in here (doubtful, as it is built for expansion purchases) but we will never know because of obstacle 1) lack of theme interest. Soon realized I could not get into the theme either, and looking at the cards and their artwork was the height of tedium. I did play the original in 1996. Times change, pc's and their 'mystique' were somewhat interesting in the early years of the internet, now they seem like stale and crash ridden remnants of the past on the way out due to tablet supremacy. That makes this theme an exercise in nostalgia that is 20 years too late. A waste of time (going to store, trying to learn it, trying to find someone interested) and money. Sold. It doesn't help that I hate my PC. It crashes, it loses my data, it's always been a headache. I have virtually zero positive associations with it over the years, unlike my ipad.  This game reminds me of my PC. I spend enought time on it. Being reminded of my PC and its problems over the years through a 'game' is actually very unpleasant and not relaxing at all. 

Bought 'Star Wars LCG' and theme interest at least got it to the table. That one gets an '8' as it does not remind me of my PC.

My relationship with this game is very strange. I love the way it plays and the design but I hate the massively ballooning number of unique cards. The inherent stress that comes with being both a completionist and enjoying a LCG is in full swing here.
If I manage to get my hands on one or two of the big box expansions then I'll probably be content and leave it at that. Otherwise, it'll probably just sit and never get played.

I want to like this game more, but it's super complicated and confusing. It's very difficult to teach, or those who do play are very intense. The asymmetry is very cool, though one downside is that there isn't any choice for multiplayer, if that affects your TCG/LCG experiences.

In my opinion, it is the most overrated game in the top 10 list of BGG. It is fun, however it is not straight forward (you have to play a few games till you know most of the cards). It is often very random since you draw cards from a deck and the luck component is too high. The bluffing element does not seem as elaborate to me as many other commenters state.  Usually there is a 50/50 chance for either player to resolve a situation in his or her favour and in the end, the lucky one wins.

Awesome game!  I've started a regular game-time with a buddy to only play Android: Netrunner.  I'm fascinated with the asymmetrical play, and how well it works!  The fact that it's an LCG makes the game easy to keep up with without spending an arm and a leg, and it's got such strategic depth!  I'm quite in love with this game!

RATING: 8.5
After first try: Played with a friend who had built both decks himself. I played runner. First game he won quite fast by meatkill. Second game was really long and I almost won by him running out of cards in his deck, but I managed to take enough Agendas before that.

To me, as a non-MtG player this seems to be a game that should appeal to MtG-players, but not that much to a euro-gamer like me. 

I liked the first tries and will buy the game, but I will probably still only be a casual player of this game, so the deck-cration and evercoming expansions scare me somewhat. will I be able to play and have fun with this without becoming a deep fan knowing all cards and combos out there?

I have not had a disappointing game of this yet.  Frustrating?  Once or twice.  Abusive?  Maybe.  Amusing?  Certainly.  But every time I've played, no matter what happened, I never felt I was wasting my time.  It's enjoyable.  The local community is excellent.  I win, I lose, I keep trying new and different decks.

Also, as for the out of the box experience?  I didn't have any problems with it.  I tried almost all of the stock matchups, some more than once, and after I was done, I was ready to start mixing it up... without spending any more money, there was still plenty to explore.

Love the asymmetrical gameplay, the theme and the mechanics are well put together and make a lot of sense, the bluffing aspect of the corporation is great and so is the risk/reward of the runs! The Best 2 player game i ever played.

My only problem with it, and it's a minor one, is that it's not a easy game to teach, but it is easy to play once you understand the rules.

A very cool take on a card based game. I personally hate games where you need to buy expansions/boosters and build your own deck, so I would never buy this, but the game is a lot of fun. One side is the runner, while the other is the corporation. Each side plays very differently as the runner must get program breakers and attack the servers (assets) or R&D (deck) of the corporation, while the corporation sets up firewalls and traps. Very original and fun and you can simply play with the base game if the continuous upgrading of your deck does not interest you. Although just the base game may get repetitive after a while.

Netrunner is amazingly tight, extremely asymmetric, and games are quick (30-45 mins).

Rulebook is OK, but uses "thematic" wording very liberally which makes it extremely hard to figure out what it's actually telling you to do, and some nuances are unclear. 

If you have someone that already knows it it won't take long to teach, otherwise it will take a few games to get the hang of it.

Probably the best card game I have ever played. The mechanics are perfectly integrated in the theme, the artwork and world is fantastic. Why did I quit? LCG's are a poor man's enemy, and I could just see it continue ad nauseam. Bought two core sets, two cycles and two deluxe expansions, sold it after a while, bought it again and then sold it. I knew it was foolishly expensive, but I just couldn't help it. That's how good this game is.

RATING: 10
Acquired at Jupiter in Nov, 2012. First plays on 11-24. Replaces Eve ccg via Jones rule for me. Initial rating, 9. [oct 2013] This game is really really great, even just with the base set. A lot of value here, tons of game to explore. The only challenge for me is finding an opponent to invest the necessary time to dive into this, as learning the cards and combos takes many plays. // Update: early in 2014 I gave this away to my only opponent. Have not played it since, and neither has he. A lot of good games have come out since then, and I'm not the type to devote myself to just one game, which is what I think Netrunner might require. It is still an amazing game however, if you are willing to put the time into it. Dropping to an "8", but would be a "10" if I could clone myself and let the clone spend the time.

Nov 2014: Played 4 times in two hours, as corp against one of my four best opponents for games. Was an amazing two hours. Raised back to a 9, and if I could just get to play this a little bit more... Man this game is amazing.

Comment: Holy shit do I love this game. The theme is dripping in this one and I can't wait to find actual opponents to play against. The deck building is the only aspect of this game I haven't tried. Amazing artwork, fast play, and LCG to boot. Can't wait to play some more of it.

Edit: After getting quite a few more plays of it in, I'm not sure how to feel about this game. I can't seem to figure out how to do well, even after almost 30 plays of it. Even against novice opponents, I tend to lose. I also don't care for deck construction in general, so maybe I'll enjoy this more if I can look up some prebuilt decks to play. This game is waning in interest for me. I'll give it a little while longer, but right now it's a 7, leaning towards a 6.

Dobra asymetryczna gra, bardzo atrakcyjna graficznie. Minusem jest otwartość gry na niezliczone ilości dodatków oraz dobieranie własnej taliico prowadzi do niepełnego zbilansowania korporacji i runnerów w podstawowej wersji gry. Niektóre korporacje/runnerzy w podstawce mają swoich naturalnych wrogów.
Pominięcie budowania własnej talii naraża mocno na losowość, która potrafi zwyczajnie zabić. Nie raz miałem do czynienia z grą, która kończyła się w 2 tury. Konieczne wprowadzanie zasad domowych.

FFG changed it somewhat, but without violating the spirit of the game. The tracing system has been greatly improved. (Although it's perhaps still not perfect. That's a minor quibble, though.) Even more fun and addictive than the original, which I did not think was possible.

Superclever old CCG remake. 

Never played the original but absolutely loved Android: Netrunner! Gameplay is radically asymmetrical, which means both players have a completely different ruleset to follow. The runner needs to build his arsenal effectively and then chose his battles wisely. The corporation is all about bluffing. 

Only played with the pre-constructed decks but it's easy to see that deck building will take this to another level. 

In the age of the dominion clone and the multi-effect card game, this cult classic feels very novel and imaginative. Richard Garfield is undoubtedly a genius.

A great game with almost puzzle-solving elements. A complete LCG/CCG newbie like me had a bit of trouble with the 'thematic' terminology, especially as the game is completely asymetrical, but it works well. Learning time for newbies could have been halved if they'd included play mats, as the server\rig structure seems abstract at first.

Edit: played some more and developed an active dislike for this. For a casual player the games seemed to end almost randomly, and I wasn't willing to invest the time in deck building.

11/16/12 - I didn't know too much about this game before I got it. I'm actually a computer nerd and when I first played it I instantly fell in love with it. I had to play through it a couple times and I'm sure I've got some rules that are wrong but the game is very thematic and forces you to make tough and fun decisions. I really enjoyed this game more than I thought I would. (Rating: 9.0)

RATING: 9.5
Quite possibly the pinnacle of CCGs. Richard Garfield really hit his peak with this one. It strikes such a great balance between strategy (deck building) and tactics (table play) that most CCGs fail to deliver (most are primarily concerned with deck building). The fact that it's an LCG now and not a TCG only makes it more balanced in that respect.

Perhaps the biggest weakness is that there is no multiplayer variant, and a second problem is that it's hard to wrap your head around the rules at first if you're totally new to the game (even though the game flows very smoothly, and is easy to follow once you get a few core concepts down). But this game is absolutely worth the learning curve. One of the highlight releases of 2012, easily in the top five for the year if not #1.

Great gameplay, but I'm not personally into the LCG concept. I got into the meta way too late to not feel like I was investing a lot.

This rating is lower than my feelings on gameplay alone, merely because I am judging it as the base game alone.

The cards aren't great, and very little deckbuild options. Fun game and probably the best lcg/tcg I've played, but not the best starter set out there.

I guess I'm never going to be a CCG fan, even when it's not collectible.  As with MtG, I really dislike the minutiae of the turn/phase orders and figuring out what can happen when in view of some other special effect.  And since I don't enjoy figuring out what sort of decks could use those opportunities effectively, there's really not much for me to like at all.  But I could see that there's a challenging game here, and the mechanics match the theme well.

Great, innovative game. The asymmetrical game play gives two very different strategic tasks for each player, although I always prefer being the Corporation for some reason. The theme is incredible - definitely comes through in game play, especially the Corporation when you are laying out your servers and protecting them with ice. Playing the Runner actually makes me feel like I'm hacking. The deck building element is essential! First few games we just used the factions straight up and the game was very unbalanced with not enough resources to do anything. This is a very good game, but can't say that I prefer it to the Star Wars or Lord of the Rings LCG. Out of the 3, I would say Stars Wars is my fav.

I can understand why this is currently (08/03/2013) at number 6 on BGG. It's very hard to play, which makes it tense and you have lots of different strategies to try out. Also thematically it all makes sense.

However: the learning curve is definitely steep. This is a typical game you have to love AND you have to have a gaming partner who equally loves the game and with whom you can play this game a lot. Given the hard to explain rules, you don't wanna explain this over and over again to different people. Thats' why this probably won't stay in my collection :s

This is a reimplementation of an old collectable card game. While the living card game format is certainly better than the collectable card game format, the living card game format that is this game is still a money grab, with monthly expansions. If you want to play competitively, you need to keep buying, which is kinda lame. If you want it for casual play and have self control, it should be OK. As a game, its certainly not a bad asymmetric card game

Recently drawn into this one, I am still terrible.  But so fun to play with someone who really knows what they are doing.  It is dazzling, a kind of game mechanic acrobatics.  So many things triggering so many others, I feel like I am watching a gymnast swing between bars, then go flying off a trampoline built into a wall while everything bursts into flames (which ultimately results in me losing).  I don't understand, but I love it.  And I want to do that.  So I struggle.  Some day, it will all be clear to me.  Until then, what a glorious learning curve.

Really awesome asymmetrical LCG. Love the theme and the gameplay, beautifully designed cards and really cool illustrations that create a very unique visual environment. It's too bad that there are so few people playing the game, don't know if I'm ready to sink so much money into a game that only 4-5 people play around where I live. I also think the price of the base game + deluxe expansions could be a little cheaper but compared to other card games the LCG model is much less expensive.

This is about as good as card games come.  I like how unique the design is and how the experience of playing doesn't feel like anything else.

I asked to learn this even though I have no inclination to get into an LCG. Very cool theme and idea, I really had no idea what to expect. There are a lot of mind games in this one. I like being the runner since I am a risky player and will go for something when I shouldn't. The corp is the one that needs to be sneaky with their hidden information. I want to play a few times but this is nothing I will get into seriously. Turned out to be more fun and exciting than I was anticipating.

After 200 games. The best experiences I've had playing a game have been playing Netrunner. I have loved thinking about this game outside of the game. But my group no longer plays and I am not interested in the world of Tier One decks. I'm no longer keeping up with new packs and now I love making terrible decks with constraints.

A:NR has some faults, but is one of the games I've played the most out of my collection. The flavor and setting are UNREAL. Ridiculously good. I've definitely gone all-in on the game and have no regrets of doing so. I think it's a step overcomplicated, and the release of new cards every month makes it hard to pick up and play. Also, with so many cards in the card pool, there are several that just aren't good enough to ever use. It's highly competitive, and I really enjoy developing new and exciting strategies. Still gotta give it a 10.

First thing, every competent player can build a good deck and have a lot of fun [u]with only one core set[/u]. How is it possible? Because there [u]isn't[/u] three copies of each card inside. Thank you FFG.

Now...

This is the game.

This is the game that combines every aspect.
You prepare your resources before the game (deck building).
You play your opponent, not your deck.
You have to manage your resources: cards, actions order, money.
You must bluff, evaluate the risk, take risk, try crazy things.
You can rarely win if you stay in your safety zone.

The game is fast and intense. It plays smoothly. The theme is everywhere.

I'm a big fan of the classic Netrunner. It has a believable theme and incredible mechanisms. It's sad that some cards have broken the game.

Hopefully, Netrunner is back in a better incarnation. The incredible mechanisms are still there, sometime even improved. The broken cards are removed.

Thanks to the factions and the Android universe, the theme is deeper than ever. The anonymous corporations now have a name, a logo, a spirit, strength points, weaknesses, and specific agendas. The runners have also different motives and manners.

The core set is playable out of the box for two players, with 7 decks and a lot of room for deck-building.

For me, this is the most exciting game ever.
Thank you Mr. Garfield! Thank you FFG!

[floatleft][ImageID=1311896][/floatleft][b][u]Initial Impressions:[/u][/b]
Finally! Fantasy Flight gets something right! It's about damn time! 

I am flabbergasted at this successful reimplementation of the original [thing=1301][/thing]. As a CCG, Netrunner was only a murmur in the gaming world but it garnished enough of a following to merit as a cult classic. Dwarfed by its older brother Magic: The Gathering, I don't think the gaming world was ready for Netrunner when it was first arrived on the scene. The original Netrunner was progressively ahead of its time but failed significantly with card balance and deck building restrictions. FFG has done an excellent job so far correcting the mistakes of the original. Android: Netrunner (A:NR) stands on the shoulders of a giant and FFG has done this cult classic justice. It will thrive as a LCG. 

[b][u]What I like:[/u][/b]
Netrunner is a cool game. This is two player asymmetry at its very finest. Each player has distinct actions and objectives. When I play as the Runner I feel like I am hacking into a Corporate system trying to find chinks in their defenses. Playing as the Corporation, I feel as if I am trying to keep the Runner out of my servers to accomplish my own sinister agendas. This game is intensely thematic.  

The factioning system in A:NR is really what makes this version stand leaps and bounds above its predecessor. Only being able to spend a certain amount of points on out faction cards really introduces some dynamic factors into this game. Each faction has built in strengths and weaknesses and you want to splash all those juicy cards from another faction in your deck but you can't have them all. Through limitation you have to strive for deck building ingenuity. 

The best part of A:NR is that it is a skill game. At the highest levels of play I have lost an entire match to one credit. It still surprises me how balanced this game is despite all the factions and cards. There are some random elements inherent in any card game but the same guy won the World Championships two times in a row is evidence enough that skill matters. 

[b][u]What I dislike:[/u][/b]
I think the thing I dislike the most about Netrunner is the LCG release life cycle model. After playing Netrunner competitively for a couple a years I got burnt out trying to keep up. I had to stop by data pack expansions after the SanSan cycle. It's sad that I got burnt out on a game I absolutely love. I think I am content with my A:NR collection now. 

[b][u]Overall:[/u][/b]
Android: Netrunner has become one of my all time favorite games. I think this is second only to Go in my rankings and that is saying a lot.

My regular 2p opponent bought this recently and we were both keen to try it. Unfortunately neither of us knew the rules already, and the rulebook is horrid. The game may be asymmetric, but I found having different thematic terminology for 'draw deck', 'hand' and 'discard pile' for each of the players unfortunate to say the least. Once we finally got going, I found the game surprisingly simple, though Fantasy Flight did their usual best to conceal that under a layer of unnecessary chrome. The asymmetry is really neat, and I like the mind games. I enjoyed the game, and would like to play again, but I do feel that most of the point of it will be getting in really deep with the deck-building and expansion packs. I don't think I'm interested enough for that to be likely.

I am a big fan of games like Agricola, Power Grid, Railroad Tycoon (Railways of the World), Twilight Struggle, Brass, and Eclipse.  As for card games, 7 Wonders is my favorite, and Race for the Galaxy is entertaining. I can tolerate Dominion with couples, but have to be in the right mood.  Android Netrunner, however, I just cannot get into.  I tried, honestly, I tried. I told myself I would even give it 10 games.  One of the games I played was intense and engaging.  The other 7, not so much. I wanted it to work, really (especially after the $40 donation to the neighborhood game store), but after eight games, I had to call it off--too many other games to play.

Although significantly different from the original CCG in a number of ways, this game still captures the heart of that amazing game, and for the most part manages to improve on it.

I think all of the changes FFG made were for the positive, and so far I'm having a ton of fun with this game.

8 - Got this in a trade and threw down a quick game, despite the initial difficulty with the terminology the rule book is pretty well laid out which allowed us to jump right in and stumble our way through making only a few major mistakes.  The next day I realized I was rolling in the back of my head how I could have done better, and wanted to play another deck to learn more about the weaknesses and strengths.  I was pleasantly surprised with how addicting this game is right out of the box.

*****
I don't think this game is bad, but when I got it I was expecting it to be more akin to smash-up, grab a base company, shuffle in the core stuff, and go at it.  Because it begs and screams to be tweaked and tuned you cannot play this with one box, you need each person to get their own set and while I would rather play this than magic I can't see convicing my crew to jump ship considering the games are much more in depth.

So LCG's, as a money making model, is awful, but whatever, that's not intrinsically a game problem. Then there's the huge amount of work you have to do to catch up on this game buying data packs and learning what kind of cards and combinations come out. I can't stand games that involve building custom decks, because then half the game isn't the game, it's preparing the materials you use to make the game. Games like Imperial Settlers are at first fine because it's all preconstructed decks, but then fall apart when you're expected to custom build your own decks for a 'better' experience. I don't want to build my best experience. I'm PAYING YOU TO DO THAT GAME! This can be a huge problem in social games like the werewolf games, and especially when you oversaturate with roles, like in Two Rooms and a Boom. 

I'm also not a big fan of a game that revolves around building these custom card interactions, but then you're still stuck with the process of drawing cards, and hoping for the best. While in game design I think that a deck of cards can be a nice randomness generator, I don't think that everything is best represented using this. In a game where you're a future-hacker, why would your stuff be randomly generated? I'd rather have there be a pool of cards that you're working from, and then have that be what you're customizing (but then you're halfway to Dominion, which features the same problems where there are certain intrinsically positively valued plays). So I haven't nailed down the problem of Netrunner in a coherent central hypothesis, but at least now I know for sure that it is what it is.

tldr: I hate LCG's but this is probably the finest LCG out there.

RATING: 9
A very tense experience. Completely asymmetrical, bluff, strategy and a lot of choices/decisions make this game a fantastic one.

The core set is quite well done too, with four Mega-Corporations and three Runners; twelve different match-ups with complete decks of about 50 cards each.
I'd say it's a complete game out of the box as it is and a good start for those interested in deckbuilding. 

A little flaw is the new FFG artwork which is so and so, while the heavier flaw are the balance problems in my opinion: Jinteki and (mostly) NBN are not so competitive out of the box. Both need more Credit incomes and the TAG mechanics are not supported by enough powerful cards to scare the Runners, which will simply take the TAGs and go for the Agendas (mostly at the start of the game). A real pity. I added some tweaks to balance both the decks.

This is the real deal. I've never seen my friend group get hooked on a game as quickly and deeply as Netrunner. A lot of the best strategies are very counter-intuitive, which irks some players but greatly rewards those looking for a deep test of skill. It is only imbalanced at the absolute highest level; anything below that provides an immersive, tightly-constructed test of intelligence and wit.

only previously owned because my little brother spilled water all over the cards, I am working on getting a replacement as soon as I can.

All right, okay, FINE. After 15 plays, trying out two corps and two runners, I can no longer deny it—this is my favorite game. I love playing as the runner, building up my rig and weighing whether to run against that juicy remote server... or maybe R&D? I love playing as the corp, pulling traps out of my deck (or knowing they're lurking down there somewhere), and daring the runner to try me. This little card over here with three advancement tokens? Is it a high-point agenda? A devastating Project Junebug? Why don't you come and see? I love the thought and care put into the game, the incredible art and how Netrunner can tell a story through the cards. I love the levity injected into this dystopia—we don't have Thomas Haas/The Source yet, but he's already our favorite disappointment.

I've only built one corp and one runner deck so far, but I adore both of them, and can't wait to try building a deck for each faction. I love that even though my husband and I have different playstyles, we can both tailor decks to our tastes. At this point, it would probably be easier to list the things I don't like about Netrunner, but my only fear is how tempting it will be to part with my money in order to expand the game. But! I also think you'll have a ton of fun without ever using more than one core.  The reason I chose Netrunner is that it seemed like an LCG you didn't /need/ to expand (if you just want to play casually), and I'm happy to say that I've found that to be true. We've been playing with the Revised Core Set for just over a week, and I can already tell that we're going to get a lot of enjoyment out of this box. However, are we going to expand so that we can explore this world and spend some more time here? Yes. Oh, yes.

If you're at all interested in Netrunner, I don't think you'll regret pulling the trigger. Just watch out for Project Junebug.

A different kind of a beast. LCG game, so you just buy everything once and then jump into deck building. Beautifully done, superb theme integration, great artwork and flavor text. 

But above everything else, here you play your opponent, not your deck or table. This is a game of knowing your opponent's hand, denying cards, stealing cards, sitting there with a poker face while secretly sneaking a trap, bluffing, double bluffing and triple bluffing. A good deck is needed, sure, but if you won't play it wisely, you will still lose. Runner and Corp game is very different and choosing from several factions, you can tailor your gameplay to your preferred "character". 

Really an amazing game, but you have to learn it a bit and construct a deck for full enjoyment. It's a gamer's game, so it will be hard to just play it casually with friends. But if you seek an ultimate card/deck building/resource management/bluffing game, you've found it.

This will be one of extremely few exceptions to the not-having-half-points rule. I currently will never turn down a game of Netrunner that I am able to participate in realistically. I love the game, and I love the direction they're taking it in.

A 10 signifies that I always will want to play the game, and while that's true for the moment, the game relies pretty heavily on an expanding meta with new packs released. If at some point FFG releases a bunch of cards that drastically change the game for the worse, then my opinion can change.

But for now, this is my card game of choice.

I traded this game away along with all of my data packs. I still think the gameplay is AMAZING, but I didn't have time to keep up with the meta-game and also couldn't find enough time to play it. I wish this was a well-balanced standalone game instead of an LCG.

This game is freaking amazing for a CG/LCG. Sadly, I feel like my collective card game days are behind me. I played Yugioh a lot, but lost interest as I disagreed with the hugely immature and cutthroat attitude of the community. The main thing that led me to quit was the way that Konami was going with the game. The public disapproval and cost for the game didn't help either.

Anyways, this game does a two player card game right. There is a huge amount of bluffing, a high skill cap, great theme, a reasonable price tag, beautiful artwork, and more. It's a shame that I don't really have too many people to play with. My friends and I would rather play a big game (like Mansions of Madness) than to play a two-player game, as we usually have a lot of people. Hey, the more the merrier, right? :D

This game is pretty darn tricky to learn though (not as bad as Yugioh surprisingly) and extremely intense. It's a shame that more people don't play.

A great card game that allows you to pick your packs, which saves some substantial money. I'm not into the big scene, just enjoy playing it with my wife. I love the asymmetrical nature of it with the various factions on each side. I also like the theme. My one and only LCG or CCG, and I'm going to keep it that way for the sake of time and money. I think I picked a really good one to commit to though. ***Wife:7.5

OK, even though it's not as head-explosviely good as many make out, it is the best LCG/CCG I've played. I love bluffing in card games, as this has a good risk/bluff ratio. Also easy enough to learn (especially after suffering through the first edition rule book)and pretty good, if a tiny bit samey, right out of the box.

However, decided not to invest in the game at all (including buying the base) as I just can't see it getting played AND I have no desire to buy 50 expansions AND deck construction doesn't excite me at all. But it could, I guess...

I think it took some major balls to release this gem. Back in the day, it sold poorly and was dominated by all the multiplayer CCGs so there's little reason to wonder why this asymmetrical 2 player cardfest didn't do that well. Still, it had rabid following (I was creating extra cards and illustrating them with 2D/3D art etc).

I was expecting that they'd just use Netrunner's name (even though the IP is old enough that I doubt it has any resonance with the current crowds - so I was mindblown to realize it's pretty much the same game.

I love it - I love the microexpansions, that they stuck to their guns with the texts etc etc.

Toma de contacto buena, con la primera partida ya da la sensación de que hay muchas estrategias y configuraciones de mazo posibles, nada mas terminar la partida nos pusimos a analizarla, los fallos y aciertos y nos quedo una muy buena sensación.

Mas profundo de lo que parece, hay muchas formas de jugar las partidas y muchas formas de perder, una de ellas duro 10 min. Proyecto Gallina Ciega, con dos marcadores de avance en el segundo turno, tres cartas en la mano del runner, incursión contra el servidor y se acabo. Hay que jugar unas cuantas partidas para aprenderse los combos y cartas.

Es un juego en el que el factor suerte es bastante determinante, cuando te haces el mazo lo haces planteando una estrategia pero si a la hora de jugar no te salen las cartas, ni estrategia ni nada, lo único que puedes hacer es ver como tu contrincante puntúa sin rascar nada. Podríamos justificarlo en que no has jugado bien los turnos, o que quizá no hayas hecho el mazo con el suficiente numero de cartas de un tipo para que tengas mas posibilidades, pero aun así si el azar no te sonríe solo puedes ver pasar los turnos. Por ejemplo, en una partida que me duro unos 10 turnos, a mi compañero le salieron 5 hielos, puntuó 5 planes y gano con los 7 puntos, en mi caso no me salio ni un solo rompehielos y eso que me había tirado barajando varios minutos mientras preparábamos. 

Eso si , espero que la siguiente vez me sonría la suerte...

I really like the game as it is truly a bluffing game at heart. Each turn is about trying to get what you want done. However, your opponent is also trying to do that. I really love many things about it... the art, the asymmetric gameplay, the interesting theme and flavor text, etc. It's a very rule intensive game however and the specialized terms such as remote server, grip and heap do not help. Also, it can really be a hard game to get out if you don't have the audience for it unlike Magic. And those $15 data packs can add up. I'm also not liking FFG too much at the moment because of the netrunnerdb cease and desist fiasco. If you do find a dedicated opponent for it, it is a very satisfying game.

I really like this one.  Fantastic theme.  Light and fun, and in your face.  Thanks for teaching me, Roland.

I can't believe I called this "light & Fun."  I spent two hours with the rulebook, and gave up in despair, ready to return the game to Judah, unplayed.  Then I found a video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAslVfZ9p-Y) which gives me enough hope to try again.

We (Michael, Steven & Molly) have played it now several times, and we all like it.

Very good card game. Not symetrical, a lot of different decks if you want to get into it, and for me over all, the filling that you outplayed your oponent in mindgames.
On the other hand some games are kind of played by itself and the luck factor is present like in every game of this kind. 

It is probably the sentiment but it didn't grab me like MTG did, even thought it is in my opinion a better desined game. 

Some time has passed and i find myself not wanting to play the game more often then not. All potential opponents are either hardcore Netrunner players and even when they give me a counter to their decks they crush me every time or they never played, teaching the game is very hard.

Ugh.

I love FFG games. I really like cyber-punk. I also quite like the idea of asymmetric gameplay and goals. I don't particularly mind LCGs.

I hate Android: Netrunner.

As runner, I feel tension. Should I go for this card, is he bluffing, am I about to snare myself? Fairly enjoyable.

As corp, I feel completely powerless. Nothing I do works, the runner can just go through R&D at will and I get the impression I'm the AI behind their single-player game.

Yes there are ways to ensnare the runner, I get this from being the runner myself. Yes you can protect R&D with good ice. Yes there are even more ways to do so in more data packs. Do I want to commit a load of money to better my corp experience? No.

Speaking of which, why do you need credits to do everything? Why does it not just cost an action or two to Rez ice? I don't see the point of having a money system tacked on top of everything else, it just favours those who are lucky enough to draw a money card early.

Used to play the original many years ago, so glad to see its return.

I have always enjoyed the theme of this one and admired the balance between the different play experiences (corp versus runner).  I currently own just the base set, but feel there is a good bit here to play with which is nice.  Choosing specific runners/corps is a nice touch and even bolsters the theme more in my opinion.

Quick playtime without too much set up time is always a plus.

Fun, solid game.

Wow.   Great 2P card game.  It is the tensest and most engaging experience that you can have with a deck of cards.

If you play the runner (think computer hacker), you'll have the feeling of being a renegade trying to infiltrate the network of an evil corporation.

If you play the corporation, you'll feel the power of trying to make your servers so well protected that no hacker has a chance of accessing anything.

Despite being so different, both sides of the game offer a great experience.

I only have the base game and that is all I plan to use.  6 plays in we've only used one of the runners and one of the corporations so far....with no deck building.  We'll play all the runners/corps and then we'll start some deck-building (thinning and personalizing the deck).  The base game has enough to keep you engaged for months/years.

Highly recommended.

What started as a great game has fallen victim to the plight of many card games: it no longer plays as intended.  There are so many cards and combinations, that the current meta supports a wide variety of strategies that have little to do with established remotes behind ICE or running those locations.  The hijinks and jank is very strong with the current level of card bloat with little to no rectification in sight.

I feel I can provisionally rate this as I played and owned Netrunner whne it was first released moe than a decadea go. FF seem to be into re-releasing 'classic' games but often they seem to pick 'okay' games to actually work with. And ths was an okay game, some clever elements but a lot of weak ones (it never really made sense as a CCG, two player, a little too much random element, not streamlined enough).

My wife suggested buying this and then we have never played it.  Guess this will have to be my New Years resolution...

Probably close to a year and finally got to play a few games.  Initial thoughts are based on just the base game.
It seems slightly to favour the hacker but that might just either be my bad luck.  Still fun and having solo'd a couple of times now, it plays quick.  Would recommend anyone playing this to try Android from FFG before hand to get some sense of theme.

RATING: N/A
+ Good in the sense that it is very different to Magic: The Gathering, unlike most other card games
+ Asymmetrical sides and strategies adds an interesting twist to 1v1 card games
+ Introduces Magic players to a new take on economy (especially when playing Corporation), also card advantage isn't as significant as it is in Magic
+ Base game gives you a fair bit of replayability, data packs are by no means essential right from the start

- A very fast moving Living Card Game that could become as expensive for some as a Trading Card Game like Magic: The Gathering. I think a casual Netrunner player could probably get by by just waiting for the big expansions (Creation and Control & Honor and Profit) to be released and getting those instead of every data pack available.

Brilliant reboot of an old liscence, Netrunner does better than ever with Fantasy Flight's LCG approach. For those unfamiliar, LCGs get new cards in waves of 20, that can be purchased for $12-15 for 3 copies of each, allowing players to focus more on building their decks and strategy than spending money and 'rare pulls' that games like Magic and Pokemon rely on.

This game was a gift. A carefully-researched and very thoughtful gift meant to be the backbone of a weekend of celebratory gaming.

Day 1: Excitement (note that no gameplay actually took place on this day)

Day 2: Confusion (“We have to watch a 20-minute video just to understand the basic jargon? TWICE?”)

Day 3: Anger (“Why can’t this game just use normal words for anything?”)

That was the first weekend. We really stuck with it for another couple of weeks by adding custom player aids, doing research online, and trying different configurations of cards. That’s more work than either of us put into our actual relationship so the game has gathered dust ever since. We’re pretty sure that all the reviews saying it’s a great couples game are written by robots from a joyless future where the only game that exists is Android: Netrunner.

It feels as though the runner should run early and run often. Early in the turn so the runner has enough clicks to shake any tags or take advantage of events that reward successful runs. Often throughout the game because, even if the runs fail, it will force the corporate player to rez Ice, giving the runner more information on what programs he should install and where to focus his efforts on later turns.

Elsewhere I've said asymmetric games always make me suspicious that players have unequal chances of winning. This can be mitigated in two player games by having the sides switch roles every match, and playing best of 5 or until one player has two more wins than the opponent.

I love everything about Netrunner except for the buy in with all of the cards. This game is theoretically my game - the meeting of theme and mechanics is wonderful. My wife enjoys the asynchronous play and especially the sneaky, trappy nature of the corporation playstyle.

Sadly, I never get around to playing this. I'm not sure why.

With any deck-building game, one needs to play repeated games to know the cards and their interactions.  Rating is low as I am still on that slow learning curve so haven't decided if I truly want to rave about the game or not.  It is getting more interesting with more plays, but shall revise the rating as I get additional chances to play to see where the rating finally ends.

I have been collecting Netrunner since its rerelease by Fantasy Flight Games, but have yet to actually delve into it.

It's intimidating to get started, and it's hard to find enough time to dedicate to learning this game properly; not just learning the rules, but getting a good sense of strategy. I feel like it will be very rewarding when I do get into it, but until then....

for a while there i was single and bored and looking for a place to hang out weekly. my local boardgame cafe is actually a LCG hub on all the other days, so i looked to see what was on offer. Android Netrunner... i remembered playing the original Netrunner long ago and i'd recently read Neuromancer, so yeah that sounded great. i bought some cards and fiddled around. bought some more cards, play during lunch at work a bit. bought some more cards, and then began to worry. for one thing, i didn't feel good enough to play at the game shop yet. i mean, it all just felt spectacularly random, despite how i could see better deck pilots succeeding. i guess the game was both more nuanced than i'm prepared for (feels a little funny to say that as a mid-high weight euro player) and occasionally more swingy-but-fast than is my preference. it's like saying "i don't care much for chess anymore because sometimes the other guy gets two queens out early, but at least it was over quick." i think it's the issue of "take-that" (counterspells, stealing, destroying, discards, etc) and what it means to me. stomping or being stomped doesn't feel very rewarding to me, even if we can easily shuffle up and play the next game which might actually be fun and not a shut-out. i'd probably very much enjoy checking out that new Legend of the Five Rings LCG, except i've run out of all that single-guy time (and money) i had before. at the moment i'm holding onto my cards because i bought Terminal Directive like a dummy. considering it's just sitting in my closet not even making it to work anymore, maybe it has overstayed it's welcome. ugg, i really wanted this to be a favorite!

Outstanding game, both in its original CCG model and in this reboot.

Android: Netrunner.. Very nice LCG.

Excellent easy-to-learn hard-to-master cardgame. I do like that you play very differently, if you play as a hacker or corporation. Corp playing defensively/passive aggressive, hacker going on the hunt for agenda's.

I like the theme a lot too, nicely different from another magic-like game.

I still think MtG offers more options, and doesn't force you to play either aggressively/passively. You are also not alloted as much freedom as I would prefer in deckbuilding. But AN is a very good replacement, that scratches a similar albeit slightly different itch for me.

Being an LCG with preconstructed decks for multiple factions is a big boost for the game, but otherwise I see no improvement over what was not all that great of a CCG.  I understand that it's assymetric with a lot of depth in a relatively fast game, but it's just not fun.  I like cyperpunk, but beyond a bunch of weird terminology, I don't feel the theme.

RATING: 10
Played the original one time back when it first came out. The bad rules and being taught by someone that didn't understand them kept me from getting into it then, but I always thought there was a lot of game under the mess of rules somewhere.

The FFG implementation is amazingly good. The core set is perfectly playable out of the box. There is a good amount of deckbuilding with one core set, and with a second core set you are really able to customize your deck how you'd like. I can't imagine how good this will be with more expansions. 

The asynchronous play is what sets this apart. Playing the corp and being a runner are so different that you really get a ton of variety. The bluffing element in the game is fantastic, and unlike many CCG/LCG games this one lets me feel very much in control. I am playing my cards rather than having my deck dictate what I do all the time. Fantastic game.

We are just getting started on this game, which appears to have a lot to offer. Very happy so far. With the exception of Ticket to Ride (an odd comparison, I admit!), I can think of no other game that gives me such delicious tension, such highs and such lows.

Plenty of game just in the core set, even just playing the core decks + neutrals without deckbuilding. Over 50 plays in now, and we haven't even bothered with the deckbuilding yet; it remains something to look forward to.

UPDATE: around play #60, we have begun deckbuilding. It makes the game even better (though I stand by what I wrote above--you can just shuffle in the neutrals and have an incredible good time).

It's not going to happen, but this is the only game I have ever played that I could imagine becoming a lifestyle game for me. In some alternate universe. Where all the other awesome games mysteriously disappeared.

UPDATE: around play #100, I am playing this A LOT now, teaching it to a bunch of my gamer friends. So the next question is whether I will burn out or not. It is now, as of this writing (March 2015), my favorite game.

UPDATE: around play #150, it is fair to say that A:NR has taken over. Taken. Over. (April 2015)

UPDATE: around play #200, we have finally opened the first expansion pack, and are "Deck Swapping" (deck building using just Core Starter + 1st expansion, so Zero influence), using at least two copies of each of the new cards, to force us to learn them all well. (May 2015)

UPDATE: 350 plays in, we are through the fourth data pack. We play Netrunner constantly. Talk about it. Think about it. An amazing game. (July 2015)

UPDATE: 500 plays, we are through the first six data packs plus first deluxe expansion. We are playing so frequently and so quickly it is difficult to keep track of the plays. Still nothing but good, with regard to ANR. (August 2015)

UPDATE: Around 600 plays, we are speeding a bit through the Spin Cycle (loaded with awesomeness), with some hope of "catching up" enough to play at some local store competitions in the year ahead. We will see. (October 2015)

UPDATE: Around 700 plays, we are finally Caught Up on data packs. We have begun testing our decks against championship decks here at home (albeit without the championship pilots!) to see where we stand, and to inspire our own builds. The next step is to start attending store tourneys to get a feel for the competitive play experience. Intimidating, but we will see. (December 2015)

UPDATE: Around 800 plays, beginning to play in store championships, making cuts and doing well. Really interesting playing against different opponents styles and ideas.  (February 2016)

UPDATE: Around 900 plays. The store champ circuit doesn't sync up well with our winter/spring schedule. But we continue to play within the family. So, so many cards in the pool right now, it just seems that anything is possible. Not only can you have hundreds of ideas for a deck, but each of those ideas can be implemented in countless ways, and accommodated by a handful of ID choices. Just amazing. (April 2016)

UPDATE: Now over 1000 plays. Amazing. Just this week, a new MWL shook up the deckbuilding rules. And that is so awesome. The boys and I got right to work building up new legal decks, trying them out. The "Living" aspect of the game is so good, and the design team entrusted to keep this thing moving forward is doing great. (July 2016)

I should love this game, but I don't. I'm a SciFi-loving computer scientist who considers Magic:tG the best game there is. The mechanics are elegant and clever, asymmetry is rare and always great.
However, the theme is stunningly ridiculous. A company knowing everything about enemy hackers prior to an attack is silly to say the least. Programms I boost by credits to get past Ice is plain dumb. The story this game tells is utter bollocks! (I'm not talking background, I'm talking about what happens on a "run"). 
And story is half the game.

One reason I've not gotten into LCGs is the deck construction. I don't want to spend the time building recurring strategies around cards and choosing what to play with. I want to play. And I was sad when I inexplicably didn't like the best answer to my tastes until then, which was Summoner Wars. But my initial impression of Netrunner is that it's easy to learn, the gameplay creates an imaginable reality and it might not necessitate deck construction.
 The asymmetry is cool abd there are tough decisions because of quality, not quantity. That's something I like too. Totally look forward to playing more.

This is a really cool experience: a CCG (using FFG's Living Card Game model) with all the depth that comes with that, but which has asymmetrical gameplay and a really engaging theme.  There is some barrier to entry, especially if you try to use all the special terminology the rulebook prescribes for simple things like your hand and deck, but I think this is quite playable if you keep some starter decks ready to go.

This is one game which I feel is better, at least for me and my group, if we don't peek behind the curtain of organized play and online metagame discussion.  Though it clearly lends itself to competitive play, I think it can work as a fun, thematic one-on-one experience with two players, so long as they both view it that way.

I love this game, I had everything for it, I spent hours building decks, reading around the game and more. But the community, wow, there are some players that have just ruined it for me saying that I don't deserve to be playing someone because I haven't been playing long enough, or actively dismissing playing me because of a deck. The community isn't anywhere as nearly as friendly as it claims to be, when a game is so great, but the community is just so anti-friendly gaming, it's a real shame.

Just a first play, really a half play as I only played as the corp.  Very similar to the original in most ways so I think I can rate it fairly with just the short play.  Still has everything I like about the original.  The runner I faced use the virus deck which was really cool but tricky for him to play.  I didn't feel like I had enough ice or enough income generation.  

I am not a huge fan of living card games.  It seems like a tricky combination of needing devoted players without the sales hook of a ccg.  I am sure it can work but once bitten, twice shy.  I liked the themed factions and they help in deck construction but also end up creating more specialized cards and sell more cards but with cool theme so it is all good.

I definitely prefer WHI to this. I'm not a fan of bluffing, and this game requires it and seems to have a higher luck factor. In my few games more than once did I find myself in a helpless situation as corpo early solely because of card draw (too many agendas, almost no ice). I think it provides less complex and interesting choices than Invasion.

Excellent asymmetrical card game.
Heavy emphasis on mindgames and bluffing if you're playing as the Corporation, which meshes really well with the theme of the game.
Excellent move from FFG to convert Netrunner to a LCG format rather than the original Collectible/Tradable CG format.
Corporation and Runner strategies continue to evolve as Data Packs get released down the line, so there's definitely a high level of replayability.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Game play is absolutely superb - if you have the right gaming partner and don't care about the outside world, then you could get a hell of a lot of play out of the core set alone. There's much to be learned about playing this game well, and it relies on more fundamental gaming skills than just knowledge of cards - ie, bluffing, reading intent, managing risk and putting your neck out, boldness and invention. I really like it.

Can't keep up with the sale model, though. It's really great that the entire game is affordable if that's your gaming focus, but it's not so great if your budget is limited, though that is what it is. There's nothing stopping a deck without Clone Chips or Jackson Howard or currents or whatever going up against a netdeck tricked out with every flash card going and still scoring a win - or even just enjoying a good game (though getting pummelled)...

If you live in an urban area where there are a lot of Netrunner players meeting up regularly for games, you are depriving yourself of a delicious addiction if you don't give it a try. It is a game that demands real commitment, though - not so much because you have to stay up to date to stay competitive (though you largely do), but because it is that good of a game in itself. Which is no bad thing.

(12/9/13) A 10! -.25 for the amount of time I spend BEFORE a game constructing decks.  I know some people love that, but it detracts a bit for me since I have a hard time setting aside time to do that.  

(3/20/14) I've played many many games of this since my last rating, many in person and even more online.  It's really fun.  BUT - down to 7.75 now. I find myself more and more wishing that I was just playing a nice long board game instead of quick matches of this LCG.  It really is a lifestlye game, and I think I'm just tiring of it a little.  Still really like playing, but it's not a 10 anymore.

WOW! what a thrill! This game is great. It's really thematic and has a great Ghost in the Shell/Neuromancer feeling to it. The factions all have their own distinctive strategies. 
Not really familiar yet with the deckbuilding aspect, but the core set delivers a really good game with enough components to keep you busy for a while!

Update: Kinda lost interest after FFG announced this weird cycle thing. Not going to pay loads of money for things I can't use in game. :( Too bad. Would be better if they just wrapped the whole game up into a solid beginning and an end. Game itself is still ace though! ;)

Traded away. Still a great game. Not really played in the area. Bad part of any CCG/LCG; you need at least two invested parties to play.

This is a promising game. If I didn't like Mage Wars so much more, I might be tempted to get into this. It's much more strategic than Magic, with the ability to spend actions each turn on whatever you need. If you don't have the cards you need, you can dig for them.

I love the setting and the artwork. The theme is so thick in this terrific asymmetric, 2-player card game. I'm not much of a deck constructor, but the gameplay here is worth it and, if I had a more regular opponent for this, I'm sure I'd be willing to spend more time building the perfect rig.

RATING: 9
My most played game since 2012 by far. Always interesting decisions to be made and if it ever gets stale, I just build a new deck using something I'm not as familiar with. I play "casual competitive" in that while to do play in small tournaments occasionally, I like to play with decks other than the top tier meta. So playing in leagues with B-tier decks, trying to improve them, and having fun is more my style.

Pros:
- lots of mind games
- super thematic
- many viable winning strategies
- building own decks keeps you invested for months

Cons:
- it takes a while to understand the game properly
- lots of mediocre cards you just won't use
- no playsets in the core game
- quite expensive if you want to keep up with the latest expansion
- casual play only with friends, the guys that play all day in the store will most likely waste any newcomers

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
In this era of multi-use card games (every card in Glory to Rome, Race for the Galaxy, Innovation etc has a gazillion uses), Netrunner has aged well, and sets the standard for single-use cards.

True to its CCG lineage, the complexity is all in the cards and the combos you make with what you put onto the table. But never getting caught with your pants down on credits (money), cards and clicks (actions) is also crucial. The play-or-draw action never fails to work for card games, giving you the option of either a more cautious approach, or to go in guns a-blazing and to hell with the consequences.

Unlike other CCGs, though, it's not merely about the meta-game. Awkward match-ups can occur, but good play (reading and signaling the enemy) can potentially overcome them. You do not win or lose merely via deckbuilding, with the face-to-face merely being a foregone conclusion; decisions during play can actually swing the game. My favorite part about CCGs was designing flavor-rich thematic decks which I would unfortunately never dream about taking to a tournament. It's great to have the freedom (or at least the perceived freedom) to design decks that are both thematic and competitive in Netrunner since in-game play matters a lot more.

The wildly asymmetric gameplay is a huge draw, especially in 2-player games. It's the Corporation vs. the Netrunner, with no clear-cut roles of offense and defense. Instead, each player tries to run out or prolong the clock at different points of the game. And layered throughout is the bluffing, where the Corporation throws out a few signals and the Netrunner needs to have discipline.

The "awesome theme" in here -- with many calling this the most thematic card game ever made (in my book, that's [thing=4174]Lifeboat[/thing]) -- is a little contrived by the game forcing you to call every single thing by its thematic name (including in the hard-to-follow rulebook), but hey, after 30min of brainwashing, it works. You get to be one of the cool kids who discusses strategies involving R&D, HQ, Programs and when to Rez Ice, instead of just where to place random pieces of cardboard (helps that I love cynical/dystopian themes). Pretty cool that the game tries to incorporate the hand, draw deck and discard pile organically too. My only reservation here is that "make a run" sounds wussy. Why not something like "let's run on it" or "break the system" or "plug in" etc? I like the "jack out" term.

[hr]
I wasn't sure after a few uneven plays early, but see now that the play style (especially of each faction) didn't click with me yet. Suspicions confirmed: the potential for smart play means 'fun, themed decks' and 'tournament-competitive decks' aren't mutually exclusive, and win/loss isn't determined primarily by match-ups. Finally a customizable game I can love again! I haven't obsessed like this over a game for a long time (with deckbuilding ideas popping into everyday life), so this deserves a bump to a 10!

Current small card pool means the faction you choose really limits your strategy (just a core theme, with variations on it), but this lowers the entry barrier, and makes deckbuilding a breeze. Factions help lend theme while simplifying the customization process, and cause the upgrade packs to be incremental changes (since 20 cards are split among 7 factions). Smart decisions everywhere. Looking forward to growing with the game.

[hr]
Warts that have emerged after hundreds and hundreds of mostly online plays, with a few tournaments thrown in:

[-] - The tournament scoring rules are flawed, biasing against certain deck-types and increasing the impact of luck. I say just do straight wins and losses (with 2 games against an opponent, if it's 1-1, so be it), and never any elimination rounds. The current flaw also magnifies the Corp/Runner imbalance (which I'd normally have no problem with).[/-] FFG listens to the fans! Still need to get rid of the system for elimination matches though: I favor tennis tiebreaker-style, keep alternating sides until one player wins 2 in a row.

 - Always the fundamental fact that a Runner can dig out of bad initial luck, but a Corp might just lose based on a poor initial draw.

 - As the card pool grows larger, Runner deckbuilding gets more and more fun, but Corp deckbuilding is a headache, since there's very little wiggle room after putting in your requisite agendas, Ice and economy (whereas the Runner never really needs to respect any sub-type constraints). I understand trimming A+B+C into A+B, but I hate have having to trim A+B+C+D synergy into just A.

 - The once-a-month incremental change helps nobody except FFG's coffers and marketing department. It'd be fine if the data packs were used to address issues with each iteration, but it appears that the cards are set well in advance. This means issues that leak out to the public take a long time to address (if at all), and the 'fix' might actually fix it too much. A big expansion every 3-4 months or so would do much better in terms of game balance and maximizing strategy space, plus foster deeper exploration (instead of, say, 1 tournament with each set of cards) and it'd be less overwhelming to have to update decks every month. On the FFG side, I suspect incremental changes are a bigger barrier to entry and keeping players than less often step changes (all the data packs do is just create buzz). I'd like some stability instead of just having 1-2 tournaments with each card-pool before it's on to the new cards, and constant tweaking again. This would've worked fine in the past when there weren't many good games around, but in this golden age of tabletop gaming, I don't have enough gaming opportunities to focus on keeping up with the monthly release schedule when there are so many other fine games that function perfectly without it, and so many others to experience.

Like any game involving bluffing, level 1 is getting ensnared, level 2 is anticipating and optimizing, level 3 is bluffing once again. Games are highly varied, and every 5 or so games, a new OMGWTF moment emerges. Even if no data pack is released anymore, the game is still a classic with unlimited replayability.

[hr]
Taking a sabbatical from this game, starting from Opening Moves (my previous one was during Humanity's Shadow). I hope Corp-Runner balance will be better when I return, the designers/developers will be less close-minded, silver-bullet cards like Jackson Howard, Datasucker and Plascrete Carapace become less common or are restricted/banned, and the distribution model can slow down.

...Currently downgrading my Netrunner collection to the bare minimum. Think I'll just play Draft and see what decks I can build out of my card-pool to teach newbies with. I only foresee maintaining decks to demo the game.

4+5

So, I finally played A:NR.  And what I was afraid of - deck-building - reared it's ugly head.  I'm not a big fan of building a deck for play in any game.  I DO like building decks through the course of game mechanics.  I can appreciate what this game is trying to do - which is why I rated it a 7 and not lower - but the timing issues, interaction mechanics, etc. are just not my cup of tea.  If I get the right offer, this LCG will follow my other previous ventures into this game genre - Warhammer, Game of Thrones - out the door.

Ah, the sacred cow. And the most controversial of opinions - I neither love it or hate it, I find it okay, but nothing special. Theme implementation works, asymmetrical gameplay works (even if corporative side seems a bit more difficult to learn to play well), art is cute, everything comes together well and that's it. Card drawing mechanism feels clunky and dated and gives uneven feel to the game, the game could be more open to in game decisions (as opposed to deck building). When I compare this to Summoner Wars it's no contest - that is a tighter and deeper design, games are tenser and more involving. It seems that a lot of people are really nuts over the theme and art or asymmetrical gameplay, but I own Android, Cosmic Encounter and CitOW, so I fail to see what the big deal is. It is the best of FFG's LCGs though.

I was somewhat seduced by the game's theme, which it pulls off brilliantly. The mechanics are great, the bluffing element makes for some tense encounters. 

I find the LCG format much more accomodating than CCGs and it solves many of the problems that put me off MTG, namely the focus on card collection and deckbuilding rather than the play of the hand. AN squares this circle very well. These is still an element of deckbuilding but the game is largely won and lost in the decision making during each hand.

Netrunner is an enjoyable game- the engine seems clunky at first, likely because of the semi-asymmetrical nature of the game, but eventually reveals itself to be quite elegant if very complex. The cyberpunk theme is just gravy and feels thematically appropriate to the mechanics (although I've never held with Richard Garfield's belief that mechanics should trump theme). While certainly not my favorite card game or LCG, I will probably rarely turn down a game.

I love the asymmetric game play, the thematic elements in what the cards do, the references littered throughout the universe, all make for a game that I dove head first into and haven't left.  I have stopped organized play dude to time constraints with the family but I still participate in store championships as well as stay up to date on all cards released.  The game is going through some rough times at the moment. However, the Campaign expansion looks very promising.

Very enjoyable game, very well designed, engaging deck-building, but I feel like it's tough to break into the "community." If you don't have friends who enjoy playing it at your level, you're kind of stuck. I bought two expansions, but wound up selling everything on eBay. No consistent playing partners.

RATING: 9
So far we I've bought every expansion for this as well, up to and including Creation and Control. I played the original 'back in the day' and it was great - this is far superior. 

The game offers a lot of tense decision making and bluffing in a very short amount of time per game. As such its ideal for taking along when you have an hour here or there to play something and are looking for a game with meaningful decisions and interesting game-play.

The game is addictive. The deck-building is excellent for those who enjoy deck-building, and it certainly scratches the itch that's stayed with me from the era of ccg's.

Update: I've taken a bit of a break from collecting every expansion for this. It gets a bit tiring buying up packs every month. Will probably still pick up Honor and Profit at some point.

[BGCOLOR=#A0A0FF][COLOR=#FFFFFF]xxG.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] This rates at least an 8 for me, may go up. Bearing in mind I only played the original Netrunner a couple times, I think this version preserves the core gameplay and feel of the original, adds a strong faction-based balancing system for deckbuilding, and of course great updated art/components from FFG, wrapped in an LCG blanket. Well done!

I really like this game, and considering my dislike for MtG, that's saying quite a bit.  LCG > CCG by far, though I still wonder how many expansions will end up being purchased.  I'm never going to play "seriously" and I have too many other games I like to just focus on one, so I think in the end that's going to drag it down a bit for me.

What can I say that hasn't been said 1000s of times before? When I was at the university I used to play CCGs such as Vampire: the Eternal Struggle and Lord of the Rings TCG. I wish I had known Netrunner back then. It feels like a perfect combination of fun during deckbuilding and fun during gameplay. I'm not sure how the game will develop in the future and there are already some ideas I don't like in the game (eg. currents, the introduction of rotation) but as it is, I can see no other game that could replace A:NR. And that's huge.

FFG changes haven't broken the game, so as this is still NR it's a 10.

Kétszemélyes cyberpunk kártyajáték. Hihetetlenül eltalált két oldalt sikerült megalkotnia a nagynevű szerzőnek. Az egyik fél a jövőben játszó mega céget testesíti meg, ellenfele pedig a minden tudással megáldott hacker, akinek célja megszerezni a jól védett, értékes adatok a cég szervertermeiből. Abszolút különböző a két fél játéka, teljesen egyedi a játékmechanizmus. Mivel régen szerepjátékoztam és volt szerencsém a Shadowrun világához ezért bátran állítom rettentő jól sikerült az adaptáció. Izgalmas partik, nagyon jó végfeltételek, kiegyenlített felek. Már az alapdoboz is nagyon változatos. Időben is max. 1 óra alatt letolható egy parti. Nem igazán lehet hibát találni benne. Nagyon jó játék.

A bit early to judge on my part, but certainly a great concept. May put players in frustrating situations if the card distribution in the deck is anomalous (a problem common to most card or card-driven games where the deck is far from being cycled through in a typical game).

Edit: a genius design, one where mechanics reflect a subject matter wonderfully.

Was so excited to get this being a long time player of Yu-Gi-Oh! back in the day and heard a lot of good about it. However... something just didn't do it for me =(
 Played it with a mate a few times sticking to the same roles and I was actually just a bit bored; even after I customised the decks slightly to fine tune them; and at the same time, I'm aware it is a well made game with a great theme and a lot of people like it. I just couldn't find it.

[i]Fantastic Game with Limitless Potential Tarnished by Over Ambitious Release Schedule[/i]

This is a thrilling game and one of the best examples of asymmetrical gameplay that I know of.

Great design where the decision to give you a menu of actions, especially having control over the rate you draw cards, gives you a greater feeling of control than other similar games.

However, there are too many expansions for my tastes that release too quickly. Why this is bad for the game:

1) Bluffing is hurt when there are too many possibilities. When game was new you could reasonably expect what is in someones deck. As the game expands, not so much.

2) This games main advantage over its competitors is that your in-game decisions matter so much more. Just because you built a deck doesn't mean the gameplay mostly ends there; you now have to play it differently against different opponents or decks. The more cards that are added, however, the more likely you are to go into disadvantaged matchups or metagame decks -- in-game play starts to gradually take a backseat to deck building again.

3) I'd like more time to explore each format and delve in deep, but there is a shakeup every month.

In short, this is one of the best games ever made which is unfortunately (for players like me) such a cash-cow that it has no chance of ever slowing down. So rating is 10 for the game, which has some of the best gameplay ever, but LCG model gets a barely-passing grade from me

Also, if you consider only the core-set, the game does not feel as complete as advertised if you want a deep or balanced game. It's GREAT for what it REALLY is -- an intro into a system, rather than the standalone game option it claims to be (where it's still good but much less than that)

[b]I'd Rather Play:[/b] Yomi. Not as strategic as Netrunner, but has a lot of the tension, opponent-reading, and strategy without relying on "surprises" from not knowing opponent's deck. Netrunner is better for people who want constant shifts in the game, while Yomi is better for fixed-content play (no surprise there, since it was designed that way)

May I be honest?  I'm mixed on this.   love Netrunner and I love Android and so this is the perfect intersection.  But I fFind I don't play it much, since I don't really look fForward to the need to build a deck anytime I want to play a casual game.  I think I should maybe get two copies and build a couple of ready-to-play sets, just so I can pop open the box and hop into a game with a fFriend.

I don't get the fuss about this one. I was asked to try it out today, and really wanted out of the game after about 3 turns. I was relieved after I tried a 'run' and instead hit an 'asset' card that wiped out my hand, ending the game. That's 45 minutes of my life I won't get back. Hated the theme, and it cemented my dislike of the whole 'LCG' genre.

RATING: 9
Bluffing, pressing your luck, spending action points... This game uses a lot of different game mechanics and executes them all well. The depth that this card game has is surprising. Though the rulebook makes the gameplay seem intimidating, it is relatively intuitive. It is also largely replayable due to the different match-ups between faction decks and the amount of card combinations available.

What makes this game unique is the asymmetrical gameplay. It creates a game of cat-and-mouse between the computer hackers (known in this universe as Runners) and the big corporations.

RATING: 10
Possibly the best competitive card game ever made. The action point system is designed so brilliantly that none of the common downsides with these kinds of games are present.

Need more cards? spend a click, draw a card. 

Need more credits? Spend a click for a credit.

"Tutoring," the act of an ability allowing you to search your deck for a specific card, is abundant in "Netrunner." This would be immensely overpowered in any other card game I can think of, but here it just allows you to counter play and build combos with ease, and since both players can do it, it works.

I love the game mechanically and thematically. The lone hacker vs an oppressive mega-corporation is prevalent in every card. So much so a game of "Netunner" can tell a story.

A hacker runs into a mysterious piece of ICE and trips a subroutine. The Weyland Corp. traces the intruder, and finds their approximate location within the city. Suddenly, outside the hacker's apartment window, the entire block explodes in in a fire-ball... Scorched Earth.

It can be played as casually or competitively as desired.

Fantasy Flight's LCG format also means there are no rare cards, you buy a pack you get a playset of every card. There's really not a better way to do it.

NetRunner is a not a game. NetRunner is a secret society. Unless a NetRunner has personally invited you, don't bother purchasing *the game*. 

Tough to learn, near-impossible to master. Once learned, the mechanics immerse players in the cybernoir theme. High-stress. The game-ending win condition can be triggered suddenly, sometimes surprising both players, hitting the loser like a shovel to the face. Best game ever. 

Among my peers, the game is a 10. However, it gets -1 for being extremely inaccessible to noobs.

Netrunner is the best. It is just the best, man. It has it all. Difficult tactical decisions. Bluffing and mind games. Luck in all the right places to keep the game exciting and tense. A deckbuilding aspect that is more about building a deck to suit your own playstyle than MtG-style ULTIMATE COMBOzz bullshit. And, unlike most other deckbuilding games in which 99% of the game is building the deck and then the actual game is just watching the deck play itself, deck construction in Netrunner is just one part of a multifaceted, interesting game.

I actually think that the game itself is quite brilliant and creates an awesome, tense 2-player experience. Unfortunately, I'm really not good at these kinds of games (deck construction and careful deck building), and so it is a somewhat frustrating experience to play it. Still, I would say that if you have to get only one game in the genre, this would be it.

UPDATE: I have grown to appreciate this game more over time, and do think it is the best game in its class. I'm not a fan of deck construction, so that element is lost on me, although I do really enjoy the asymmetric challenge the game itself presents. Certainly well worth owning and playing, if you're into such a thing.

I am not the live-game kind of person, I hate playing against someone who might have cards that I don't have, I hate games where you have to think over your strategy and perfect your deck beforehand, in order to win. I don't want to play with people who could have spent hours watching game reviews and cards reviews.  I don't want to have a PhD in Netrunner-gaming, I just want to enjoy a game where everyone could have the same probability to win. As a result, I can only play with the basic game (no deckbuilding allowed with me :p), knowing that the other player (my partner) knows everything about it and there is no way I can win.  So a bit frustrating.

 Giving it a 9, because some of the cards and identities seem a lot more effective than others. I prefer being the runner over the corp anyday. Game play and strategy can be really different depending on the corp/runner combo. My husband is the only person I've played with so far and after over 20 plays, we're still not bored of it, but tensions do run high during the game, because it's a dueling game and if you're at all competitive, it can be INTENSE. 

I think the gameplay would be totally different if I wasn't always playing with the same person. I want to teach it to my gamer friends, but most are intimidated by the rule book and what they perceive to be a steep learning curve. Even after playing it for four months, I still have to look stuff up sometimes. I like the challenge, but it would be more interesting to play with different people! Overall, it's a solid game that I enjoy playing, particularly if I want a more cerebral, intense gaming experience. 

The only downfall is that it's a Living Card Game with lots of data packs, so if you're not keeping up with them, you are probably at a disadvantage when playing with others. It doesn't lend to casual game play.

RATING: 7
This fills a nice little spot in my collection.  I probably like other two-player duel games better, for example Mage Wars and Diskwars but both of those take upwards of 2 hours to play and both are a little harder to get a new player up and running with.  This game takes probably around 30 minutes per play and isn't too terribly difficult to teach others.

The game is a completely asynchronous card duel.  One player plays a corporation who plays cards with the intent to score them and protect them with cards called Ice.  The corporation plays many of his cards face down and can do a lot of sneaky things this way.  The other player is the Runner, he is trying to steal the cards the corporation plays to score them for himself and otherwise disrupt the corporation player.  Both players have tons of different kinds of cards to augment their ability to do these things.

One thing I realized right away when playing this game though is that the more experience players have with this game the more it changes.  As I said, many of the corporation's cards are played face down and this can lead to some fun strategic options and surprises.  However the more a player knows about the cards and which cards are better and more frequently played and which cards are available to the different corporations the better the runner player can play to avoid those nasty surprises.  The same works the other way around too.  In my first play of this game I used a pretty popular card on my corporation opponent called Account Siphon.  In our second game the corporation player spent his first turn defending against specifically that card.

I'm not sure these changes are for the worse but it definitely changes how the game is played.  It becomes more about playing smart and strategically and less about the exciting "oh, shit!" moments.

I like the LCG model when comparing it to something like a CCG rather than another board/card game like Dominion.  Sure, they release a new deck of cards every month but those decks of cards are between 10-20 bucks and you get a full playset of all the cards released.  Only the base set doesn't give you a full playset of all the cards.  This is A LOT cheaper than keeping up with a CCG but the gameplay and deck building still feel very much like one which is great!

After a few more plays and getting into the deck building I don't like this game as much as I thought.  Everything I said above is still true and I do like the ease of entry, hidden card mechanics, and asynchronous gameplay.  However, each side only does a couple of things.  With all the extra content released for the game and hundreds of options available there are very few cards that do something new.  They all do variations on the same things and for that reason the game gets old pretty quickly.  And this is even more egregious BECAUSE of the amount of content they've released.  Also, the theme never really grabbed me.  I like scifi just fine but the art and flavor text on these cards along with the gameplay just don't get a fun science fiction theme across very well.

Fast game, medium weight, combo driven. It has a very cute bluffing feeling but I miss some strategy here. It feels very much like a tactical responsive game.
The interaction is obvious and the theme is clever.

Rating this game quite high, despite the fact that I sold it. It may be the greatest 2-player asymmetrical game that I ever played. I love the balance and the different corporations that each require their own approach. The games gets from confusing to good, then good to great. To me, it also got from great to overwhelming. 

There is some bluffing involved, which is not my cup of tea, but here, it's simply so well-implemented that I cannot complain. 

I am not sure about the endless expansions to follow the meta, but I guess some are fully into this and I don't want to ruin their fun. I left the train, but it was a great ride while it lasted.

I want to love this. I want to slip into the culture and look forward to every release. But I may not be a LCG or even CCG person - too early to tell.

RATING: 7
Though I played the original I have absolutely no memory of what the game was like.

I have really enjoy playing this version though, and the management of the Corps assets, for both optimum effect AND bluffing the Runner is brilliant. There is a fantastic rhythm to the game with both sides needing to husband resources, with the runner needing to pick the weak spot and get the timing right.

Not enjoyed a CCG style game so much since the heyday of MTG. 13 games in and still very happy exploring the game through the core set decks. I will try some deck building but this will start in earnest when the expansions arrive

One small concern I have about my enjoyment of the game is that (and this might be my lack of a deep understanding of the game) is that it seems so be a money battle -  having the efficient attack/defense structure where it costs more for your opponent to acheive their goals than it does you or having a better money making machine. Out of the box I could never imagine not playing with 3 Hedge Funds/Sure Gambles (and i'd play with 6 if i could). Money feeds ice/breakers and agendas (and in deck building i'm looking for the most efficient) - so i need as much money as possible. My intuitive guess about what the corp is doing is based around their resources. I imagine expansions are going to flesh out the other parts of the game and I don't like the game, for starters. as this efficiency battle - but for it to be a keeper I hope that low income strategies will work in the future

About 20 games in and have tried some deckbuilding with core set - needs more cards as there are too many no brainers in the set.

I love the theme and the asymmetrical setup of the game.  I only have two problems with the game:  (1) is the fact that, with some luck the runner can railroad the corporation quickly before a defense can be setup and (2) the fact that the runner can often be as rich, or richer than a mega-corporation.  Minor gripes overall.

After playing this for a few months, I'm totally into it. The asymmetric play, the bluffing, the mind games... all of them combine to make this an incredible game that I always want to play more of. That's to say nothing of the awesome [url=https://killscreen.com/articles/why-netrunner-matters/]theme and world[/url], which are thoroughly baked into the cards and mechanics.

I love this game.

To be fair, teaching it is a little tough, especially when there's a huge skill differential between the teacher and the new player. I use [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Netrunner/comments/1fvnpb/how_i_teach_netrunner/]this setup[/url] to teach the basics of the game, and then I try to go easy on new players or else secretly give myself extra challenges/handicaps in order to level the field a bit.

Played repeatedly - this is my go to game with a couple of friends for 2 player. None of us really have time for the tournament scene or doing the full LCG thing so we pretty much use the base set.

I love everything about Netrunner from the theme to the artwork but my favourite part is playing as the corp and messing with my opponents head - "Are you sure you want to access that server? It took you so long to replace all the breakers I trashed when you ran into my last Aggressive Secretary..."

Great game.

hmm..not sure if I'm drawn by hype or it's just that cool! ..guess both:D

Edit: I did meditate over it for some nights, seeing all cards (up to Cyber Exodus) at once on some few tables, shuffling tokens of vitural decks over it and recalling my 'feelings' from plays.. and then I realised this wasn't for me and never will be. 
Random draw deck of several kinds of cards (with pretty plain effects) makes only bitter frustration after each play and even before a play, when 'strategising' over the deck building. I don't want to put that much money into such a contradictory construct with tons of 'useless' cards.. But I remember I did once..   
Asymmetry felt nice but bluff didn't work much here for me.. wanted to love it, but it was a mistake in my case.  However, theme and artwork is great. sigh..

E: gladly did get rid of it.. and the day after I found out MageWars that works fine, for me..and LCGish games had a reason to exist again, for me :P

I was dubious about Netrunner at first. The game seemed limited in scope, as if the game designers would run out of design space after a couple of years. Fortunately, they've proven me wrong.

Netrunner is a testament to FFG's ability to take an existing game system, streamline it, give it good artwork, and keep a consistent flow of interesting cards coming.

The game has a great community and a diverse player base. It is undoubtedly the pre-eminent non-collectible card game in the world right now.

+ Play time is just perfect at under an hour
+ Lots of value with 7 decks integrated in the base game

:thumbsdown: DISLIKE
- Good learning curve that's not helped by the crappy rulebook
- You need to play regularly and buy expansion to get into the deck building aspect of the game
- Card design could be a lot better

:star: VERDICT
Just wow! Feels like nothing out there. Replay value is through the roof and the play time means you can play lots of game back to back. Unfortunately, it needs a good time investment and extension buying to get into the deck building which I can't really afford.

RATING: 5
I think this is the very first CCG/LCG/TCG/xCG-style game I've ever played (nope, never tried Magic).  I still need to try out the Corporation side of things, but my initial verdict is that this isn't for me.  Admittedly, theme is important to me and I don't give two toots about the cyberpunk setting (I know pretty much nothing about cyberpunk other than I read the book "Snow Crash" and hated it - nope, never seen Bladerunner).  But the game play itself just feels like a grind: I try this, didn't work; I try this, worked a bit, now how do I get more money?; I try this, get some money; I try this, finally got something; now how do I get even more money?  Every stage of the game feels like the same slog, and there's really not much of a dynamic arc to the experience.  Other than that, the components are decently average, the artwork is sufficiently dull for the cyberpunk setting, everything is fairly functional.  One word of praise I do have to give the design is that on both sides of the table, there are several different factions which all have very different assortments of cards (yet, again, the actually game play doesn't feel all THAT different).  I'll continue to play the game because one of my best gaming friends enjoys it and as a result I do find enjoyment in playing it with that person, but left to my own devices I'd happily give it a pass.  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 1.5/5  Total: 5/10

RATING: 7
Excellent, strongly-themed cyberpunk LCG, the first *CG I have played in a long time that does not cry out to be explained by comparison to its minor differences from Magic: the Gathering. For that alone I am impressed, though the rule changes from the original Netrunner seem to me to have taken it in quite the wrong direction.

One player is a corporation, whose hand, deck, discard pile and played cards are servers which the opponent, a "runner", wants to hack into. Many of the corp's cards are played face down, adding a strong bluffing element even if the contents of the deck are roughly known; played as intended (as a deck construction game) there is room for far more.

Much simpler than expected other than the use of confusing terminology -- but unlike many such games, the jargon really is justified and useful. The theme actually comes through in a way I have never experienced with this genre.

Unfortunately, also moreso than other deck construction games, I'm not sure it's worth playing without involvement in the construction metagame. My strong impression is that too much hinges on the bluffing, the doublethink and the mystery to get much mileage from the pre-constructed "starter" decks in the base game box. I'm not convinced it's worth keeping in my collection for the casual play it will receive, but if I were to pursue CCG-style play with any game it would be with this one.

Although the language takes a little bit of getting used to, and the rules are hard work when trying to find the little details, the game is well worth all of that effort. Play really does develop well, and the game balance seems quite good. The base deck is more than enough for any player looking to get a good amount of play out of this, so I don't feel the need to rush out and buy another box set and all of the expansions - I'm quite happy with what I've got. With a bunch of corps and runners there is plenty to do.

As for gameplay the flow is tense, and exciting, the bluffs work better than I'd both expected and even hoped for. This doesn't feel like an old game at all, and just shows how forward thinking this idea was when first conceived.

Great game like the original. Similar complaints to the original though. The Runner is too open and straight forward for a game that is all about bluffing and out witting your opponent.

Plus, it feels like a lot of the game boils down to luck. Luck that the runner accesses agendas in core servers (your hand or your deck) instead of actually planning their attack correctly.

Finally, the whole LCG format is great, but requiring people to buy 3 copies just to get everything is really lame.

Was way ahead of its time when it was first released.

The one thing I like the most about Netrunner is that card draw isn't as limited as it is in too many CCGs (notably in MTG and Hearthstone). You can cycle through your deck pretty fast so it's rare to lose just because you didn't draw some particular card.

FFG is doing a fantastic job with the game and the Android setting is super-interesting, too.

Awesome game. Only have the core set but once I get a few more plays in and familiarise myself with the decks I will probably get the datapacks/expansions.

This game was a mystery to me.

Not the game itself, rather why I did not enjoy it was a mystery.

I love deck builders, I love the cyber punk theme. I loved laying down ice. I loved the bluffing and trying to outsmart my opponent. I love card games. The cards looked beautiful. I love the concept of the game and everything about the game.

However, for some reason that I cannot explain, I just did not enjoy this game, and I tried many, many times to enjoy it with several different people.

One of the best games I've played. I hesitate to say that it's "THE GAME", but that's mostly because other games have other advantages that this one doesn't. The gameplay has been smooth once we got the basics down. Artwork = sweet. The customization is really fun and building decks is only going to get more enthralling as the game expands. The rules make sense and besides a couple of nasty little tactics the game is fairly even. Since my only real complaint with the game doesn't have anything to do with gameplay, mechanics or balance, then I'll leave that to be covered in a more appropriate space for useless (and probably childish) rants against FFG.

Seems decent from my few plays but it won't get enough table time and relearning the cards every few months does not make for a fun time.  Not the right fit for me.
--
Played it a fair bit more. I love the art and theme. I like how thematically it all makes sense. But then it all falls apart. All this theme in the design makes it all just a little too complicated. There are too many different types of card, too much structure and too many factions. Imho flexibility of design should be a core consideration when making a L/CCG but here they've gone for something very structured and much to its detriment. The one advantage it does offer though is easier deckbuilding for beginners. 

The pre-constructed decks are abysmal. I'm not sure they could have made worse decks for learning. Once you've built something worth playing with, then a few more problems arise. First is the bad shuffle and/or the runner was lucky and grabbed half of the Agenda's needed to win on the the first turn. The second is that if a runner miscalculates when or what to run at the game can instantly end. Experienced play alleviates the latter but it creates a horrific learning curve.

As for the gameplay itself. I've never been a fan of action points for card games.  How to explain it? I suppose that the actions don't really feel like actions. They feel like micro-actions most of the time. Sure occasionally your get a turn when you do multiple runs or can quickly advance a card but the majority are preparation work for the interesting parts and guess what, preparation isn't all the interesting. Other downsides are the ridiculous amount of card interactions that can occur during a run. I'm guessing this is just part and parcel of the LCG format but it seems pretty silly.

I have other concerns as well. 
-The rulebook follows FFG normal format which means it's absolutely fucking terrible as a reference and only okay to learn with when you read it straight through.
-Tons of cards have text that indicate a type of ice/icebreaker that doesn't yet exist. Is this fluff or are those coming in the future? As a beginner it was confusing. 
-The game doesn't lend itself to limited formats due to the aforementioned complex design. This is an egregious offense in light of the LCG format as it essentially requires complete collections. In fact I'd argue that this makes it worse than CCGs.
-I can't get anyone else to play it

So what are we left with? A game in severe need of streamlining designed to keep hardcore players spending money. As a game for casualy players, sure there's plenty of play in the box but it's not very good.

Played it a couple of times now. I still don't understand how this game can be in the "top 20" year after year. It's not a good game. Not even average. The "strategy" is that the runner runs whenever possible. If he's lucky he will hit 7 agenda points before the corporation has built impassable ice-defenses. That's it. I even bought several upgrades to see if the game gets different with them. It doesn't.

It's solid versus assymetrical fun. It takes awhile to teach to new players, especially without having starter decks pre made if you have any of the expansions. Maybe my set's just not organized so good.

Anyhow it's fun, has tons and tons of cards for different deckbuilding strategies and the new draft play mode is pretty wild.

Absolutely, surprisingly good. Very skill based, very good balance between corp and runners, completely different feel to the game depending on your side, very interesting factions. A million things to tinker with. No two games feel the same. THE SINGLE BEST GAME if you are a casual player, playing with casual friends. Absolutely amazing!

I really enjoyed playing it for the first 3-4 cycles and the deluxe expansion up to Data and Destiny. The core gameplay of the game is definitely pretty high up in the mind games/interactivity for me. But the design decisions and various meta game degeneration eventually turned me and my friends away from the game. 

But hey, the good news is I met and became friends with a diverse bunch of gents who are awesome buddies to hang out with. 

I'm seriously considering turning my collection into a cube or perhaps some pre-setup decks to play with people.

The bluffing/poker aspects of the game is the most intriguing mechanic for me, that and the action points to govern actions in the game. 

Not to mention the asymmetric aspects of the 2 players each playing totally different decks (corp vs runner) each with their various IDs that define their play-style and card pool, and between the corp and runner, the winning condition of the game existing only inside the corp's deck and the runner has to attempt to steal that. This just ooze that hacker vs corporation theme and mechanically is just amazing.

All these mechanics were sadly marred by an era of bad card design, which quite likely killed quite a bit of the player base. I'm sure there are people playing it still but for me and my gang we can't really go back to it. Sometimes I do wonder if the basic mechanic structure of the game can be made into a team-based or multiplayer style game. 

We've also seen the light with regards to the LCG model as well.

Pros: Highly strategic which is typically a huge plus. Innovative theme.

Cons: Top of deck plays a factor, so some luck involved. Very complex.

Final thoughts: Fun two-player game. Just too heavy for a lot of people.

RATING: 8
Played this game only with "Mac" vs Jinteki and vice versa (which was in both cases a lather lopsided deal) but we had great fun and could see the potential of this game. Expect this to get better with replay, and of course, get really better with more variability.

However, with all such games it is the question to either sink in or stay out. I will keep my base set for now for the occasional good rump, but Mage Wars keeps being my favorite 2p LCG as of now.

About the game itself: the wonderful asymetric gameplay, the deckbuilding aspect and the overal hand/action management make it a very good game. The tension resulting form the flow of the game is what makes it great. As the Corporation, you never know when you will be visited by some pesky runner. So you have to weigh your options very carefully, bluffing your way out sometimes. As the Runner, gameplay is easier but you have to set the moment to run. You decide when to run. Not the Corporation. Which gives you a big advantage. However, it is up to you to fully utilize that advantage and not let yourself get caught by some unexpected Ice and/or event cards following your Run (especially when traced), but also not have your decision 'where to run' guided by the Corporation. And that is where the bluffing element comes in. 

You'll find yourself thinking:
"Is that remote server easy bait on purpose? And if so, is it not that I should think that it is a trap? Surely he wouldn't put a juicy agenda there. Or is that what he wants me to think? Running against the deck then? Hmm. Heavily protected. Or at least, it seems. Perhaps that one Ice is simply way better than this whole row at R&D." 

Choices, choices.

That is what makes Netrunner great. I wonder however if not every expansion will simply shift the metagame to favorite another 'strongest build'. Of course, there are always counters to a strong build, but then you are tailoring your deck to your opponent's instead of going from your own strengths. Ah well, maybe my perception is simply skewed because of the Jinteki underpowered experience from the base game.

This game will get replayed. Will not buy in yet though.

I loved it the first few times I played. I want some more plays before I pass judgment. The system here is impeccable. My concern is that the base set might be too sparing in the flavor it allots to the various factions as well as in the tactical opportunities provided by the set. I understand Fantasy Flight are trying to create a new wing for their Android franchise, but I'm worried that they might have been too stingy between the flimsy quality of the cards, the $15-for-3-each-of-20-cards expansions and the tactical limitations of the starter set. I feel like I've been sold only part of a game for a full $40 price tag, and I'm really hoping that more plays prove me wrong. Had I waited a few weeks, I could have paid $26 and felt much better about the purchase. Again, we'll see.

Edit: Expansions were not tightly designed at all and further play has confirmed my worries about the base set. Still mechanically sound and an excellent, if incomplete and awkwardly expanded card game. They focused on providing deck builders a meta game rather than provide players a better game--and the result is a weaker game with deck-builders content enough with the meta-game not to notice.

It's a bit long to play, but this is my favorite living card game. Oh boy. It's beautiful, it's solid, it's challenging and now it's improved through the LCG format and some rule updates.
There's a level of bluffing, of strategy and what I love is that no matter how good your deck is, the player's choices and strategies are what really makes a difference in a game. 
In addition to that, the completely asymmetrical play style between runner and corp is very interesting, each with different play styles and goals. Great game!

Wow... is it possible to give a higher score than a 10?

The Living Card Game style is fantastic, as you don't end up spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars to try to grab those elusive few rares, only to end up with 20 duplicates of the same cards. 

Android: Netrunner is impeccably balanced and is deeper and more complex/strategic than all other collectible or living card games. Hundreds upon hundreds of hours of entertainment here... I can't recommend it highly enough!

Android: Netrunner is a good game but it’s expensive. There’s an endless release of expansions and if you bought every one it would cost hundreds of pounds. You only need a subset to play and you can pick and choose but never the less it’s costly. The game itself is quick and skill is more important than luck.

Been waiting to play Netrunner ever since I first got into CCG's in 1997ish and the magazines were saying netrunner was the best ccg at the time.  Never really did play it, but we did manage to acquire two starters and ran with that a while in school.

Fast forward to FFG's announcement and I was so happy.

And finally got it for christmas and what can I say.  I love this at the moment.

Blew me away.

I love the asymetric play and hidden information. The point system for deck building is also great, as it allows for even more surprises, you can never be completly sure what you're up against.

The current card pool is not that big at the moment which seem to limit certain corporations but that drawback will diminish with the release of future data packs.
Also with two base sets you will only need one of each pack for casual deck buildind which makes this one a winner.

My best gaming experience of 2012.

The most strategic, best designed of any CCG/TCG ever made.  Unlimited replayability.  Great diversity in deck design.  Amazingly good at maintaining thematic integrity.  Great artwork.  Suffers very slightly from some fiddly rules and card interaction rulings that don't quite follow logic, but that's a fairly common occurrence in FFG's LCGs.
Update - dropped from 8 to 7 due to the addition of cards from recent expansions that add some disappointing effects that just seem out of place but, unfortunately, are cards necessary in a deck for competitive play.

Another game I really want to love. I can see that there's more under the hood than I've discovered in a few games, but have never had a great experience with it so far. Guess it's one of those "I should have been 14 and played this a whole summer to _get_ it" games...

FINALLY got around to playing this (the criticism about the overuse of game-specific jargon was absolutely a delay into get into the first game).  One we got going, I can see why this game is popular (and why people who play a lot need to get expansions); since we will only ever be playing intermittently, the base game should be more than enough for us. The game is highly thematic but well integrated. I do wish some of the text was a bit clearer on the individual cards. I did get through with a win as the hacker and we got a sample some possible strategies for future play.

RATING: 4
First play: 20 minutes of teaching and then on the first run into R&D, I hit a snare. Lose all my cards; game over.

We pretend that card didn't happen, put it to one side and carry on.

Later, in 2 runs at R&D, I pull 2 agendas back to back, I'm now 5-0 up and the other player basically has no chance at this point. All essentially just luck of the draw.

Essentially, this is another typical FFG game for me: lots of artwork, lots of stupid cards that I need to be able to read upside down from across the table, very few meaningful decisions (hmm, I can run freely at that pile, or try that heavily protected one; let's play this card and see if it's worth it - nope, it's a bluff), every time I play a card in to my display, I then have to check the other 8 cards to see if they do something, oh and lots of jargon that 'adds' theme, but makes it largely incomprehensible.

It's like an A-Z of bad game design. Poor. Even by FFG standards.

So this is the same game we used to have a long time ago, but it's been updated.  And it's no longer a CCG, which was my main problem with it the last time I played it.

It's a good game.  Fun, entertaining, fairly inexpensive for the amount of game you get in the box.  If you're going to play a CCG Game, I suppose this is one of the better ones to get into.  It has the benefit of being very different based on which side you're playing, and you have to build two decks instead of just one, so there's a lot to explore.  

However, playing the game requires constant updates, and keeping up, and just not something I have the time and energy for, I'm out.

Other games (Like Star Wars LCG) stand a better chance.

34 oldalas játékszabály, ennek ellenére a játékmechanizmus nem olyan bonyolult.

Arra számítottam, hogy kicsit jobban átjön a számítógéphálózatos világ a téma tekintetében. De a fő mechanizmus az ice kontra icebreaker nem volt ismerős nekem. Az is fura, hogy a cég trace-el támadhat, amit a runner link-ekkel védhet. Semmi firewall, vagy trojan, vagy ilyenek.

Az előzetes pakliépítés mechanizmusa nekem még mindig bizarnak hat. Némi stratego érzésem volt, mert titkosan el kell helyezni csapdákat, aztán ha az ellenfél arra támad, akkor megkapja.

One of a couple of games that I've devoted a huge chunk of my life to. A remarkable design, especially in comparison to MtG: the board is largely permanent, the economy is largely not.

But I still have nostalgic feelings for it.

I played a LOT of the original Netrunner back in the day - don't see a "need" in my case to get this one, but will definitley keep an eye on it.

Will be interested to see if they can't slow down a Corps "fast processing" deck - it's nearly unbeatable in the original game, since it moves so much faster than a Runner can.

UPDATE: Just order via NKG - looking forward to this very much!

UPDATE 2: Well, they didn't screw it up - I can say that much! The factions are an un-neccesary addition, but otherwise, it looks like the new version is OK!

Netrunner is a good strategic 1v1 card game. I enjoy its asymmetry and the interactions among the rules and among the cards. (And the flavor's nice too, I guess. :P) However, I am hesitant to invest the money or the time it would take to introduce more variety or competitiveness to it. In particular I would expect to acquire three more small data packs to reach an adequate level of variety/power across all factions, or one small and one large data pack for a specific Corp or Runner faction.

If you shied away from Magic: The Gathering for mechanical, thematic, or balance considerations, I would encourage you to give Netrunner a try. If for deck-building reasons, Netrunner might still resolve them if your primary issue was having to choose to purchase specific good singles or to buy the booster packs at risk of randomness. (A lot of people say you can build with just the core and still be content; I'm not convinced of this, as the options seem rather limited even with cross-faction imports.)

There are fan-made variants for arbitrarily many Corp-Runner pairs (Big Sellout) and Corp v 3 Runners.

So far so good. I enjoy the asymmetrical play and tactical feel of each turn. In my limited experience with the game so far, I am still having trouble getting a decent money engine going. We are all just stumbling around a bit, experimenting with different ICE, programs, and combinations. I also wonder if Fantasy Flight's starter decks wouldn't benefit from expansion and customization. I look forward to building my own decks and digging into this game.

Update: After some expansion and many additional plays, I enjoy this game more and more. The deck-building experience is one I didn't know I was missing since my day of playing Magic. Having to manage the strategy from both sides, corp and runner, adds complications and variety. This is a very solid game.

Another update: The problem I'm running into is that most opponent around here are way more serious about the game than I am: tournaments, in-depth discussion of strategy and card combinations, etc. I'm looking for casual play, but the nature of the game pushes people towards the other end of the spectrum.

Android NetRunner essentially sells me on two things: firstly, I love the hidden card system, as the corporate player essentially sets up a shield of bluffs that the the hacker must decipher, and the action point system. Not only are those mechanics unique, interesting and really fun, but they really ramp up the depth of strategy. 

This game probably doesn't rate higher for me simply because I suck at it, and I didn't get hooked into deck building.

I'm not sure why I don't like this game more. I love the theme. The mechanics are great for the most part, if a little fiddly sometimes, with a few easily forgotten or misinterpreted rules. But mainly I've been put off by a few bad experiences, where the players (especially the corp) draw all the wrong cards at the wrong times, and end up being entirely defenceless. I know this game couldn't possibly have been scored as highly as it has if it all comes down to the luck of the draw; but that's certainly been my experience of it so far.

Phew I can see why it's been on the Hotness for so long - it's great with assymetric sides going at each other, a possible 12 combinations of factions, and some very neat gameplay this one's a winner. However very messy rules because of terminology - I think if I hadn't been taught this I would have struggled absorbing teh rule book. Once you're there your flying, but it seems a steep learning curve initially.

Ratings-wise, this appears to be the most beloved of the Fantasy Flight living card games, but I think I like several of the other titles in the line (like Warhammer Invasion, Lord of the Rings: The Card Game and Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game) better. The asymmetrical design is kind of nifty, but I think the deck-building aspect of Netrunner is far more important than in the other LCGs and achieving balance between the very different runner and corporation decks can be difficult, leading to some lopsided games. With some of the other Fantasy Flight LCG's quickly cobbling together two decks of relatively equal power is pretty easy. That ease of casual deck-building is missing in Netrunner. On the plus side, the game is deep and interesting. But I don't think I'm going to play it often enough to get beyond the casual experience, so Netrunner will never shine for me as it does to diehard fans.

This is the most addicting game I have ever played, until they started using those NAPD rules.  I played this game for 2 years, and I could not stop.  Eventually, I felt like this game was broken(e.g. corps too fast for runners, runners that could break into any server).  I would recommend if you are looking for a 2 player VERY technical game.

I'm not a huge card game player.  I will admit I find Magic to be a good game, although I only ever play it with my friends spare decks because I am not into having to constantly upgrade my decks and re-tweak.  Android: Netrunner has a similar gameplay style without the need to constantly buy new cards etc, while at the same time has variety in the characters/corporations you play with so it's not always the same 1 to 1 matchup.  The game is fun, and thematically feels like you're trying to hack, or stop a hacker.

RATING: 6.5
This one will definitely get more chances as we played it horribly wrong (which isn't too difficult with all the errata and FAQs), so the rating is very preliminary. Currently I'd rate the game as a 9 for the netrunner and a 5 for the megacorporation. The netrunner makes all the action, setting the stage for his virtual jabs whereas the megacorporation just sits and waits (turtles). If you want to put it positively, the megacorp plans its next sinister moves and gets the kicks watching the runner being ensnared in the traps it has set. But really when it comes to fun, go for the runner.
Now I just can't give a middle 7, when odds are quite high a play style is forced upon me, I do not gain much pleasure out of. I guess, I'll just have to make the megacorps palatable to new players. Other than that the game comes with the outstanding art which has become standard for any FFg Games and has a very interesting concept.

After 10 games: Great so far. Want to play more.
The decks seem to be more similar to each other than magic the gathering decks but you have more interesting decisions while playing it. I hope deckbuilding is as great as magic then you have a good game.

Update:
Awesome awesome game! The mechanic is brilliant and fits perfectly to the theme. The identity card makes the playability of the cards much deeper. You have a lot of interesting decisions when you play. Much cheaper than magic. 

The community is fantastic also.

Finally decided to comment on the game. One of the best games I own. I'm at the point currently that all I think about is deckbuilding with this game. It scratches that cyberpunk itch.

RATING: 4
I have a threshold for CCGs based on complexity of deck building... The more complicated it is, the more I like it UNTIL a certain threshold, at which poinit becomes so complex it becomes a chore. Netrunner is so complicated it started at that point of highly engaging, but became chore like and unenjoyable after, like, two major expansions. The game is brutally competitive in terms of rewarding good play. It sounds good, but it means the best player wins so consistently, you should expect to never win against your betters... Depending how you rank in your play group, this may mean it's no fun because you always lose, or no one want to play you because you always win.

RATING: 7
I adore the original Netrunner -- and I'm one of the lucky few to have a halfway decent collection (enough for six very playable decks.)  So I was hesitant as to whether or not I'd want to take the plunge on the reboot.

Well, now I've held it, and played it.  And the answer is yes, I want it.  I love the Android universe, and there's a lot of fun, original card ideas in here that made me smile. Will I get suckered into buying all the expansions?  Gosh.  Time will tell.

The only thing that's bothering me so far is the format.  At this point in time (and for my foreseeable future) there won't be a lot of surprises.  Haas-Bioroid will have the same ICE every game, Anarchs will have the same breakers....I doubt enough of my friends will get into the deckbuilding aspect.

EDIT: And now I have it -- thanks, Justin!  The fact that I have received it as a gift makes it much more likely that I'll end up buying expansions.  Wish I had a FLGS!

EDIT: I have no interest in buying any expansions, and most of my friends didn't really go for this.  So as it stands, there's fun to be had here, but without plunging into the whole LCG lifestyle I'm not likely to get much mileage out of the base game.  I'll probably just stick with the old Netrunner, for which I have hundreds more cards, and just feel like a curmudgeonly old hipster.

I don't mean to rock the boat, but I think NetRunner is a bit over-rated. The instructions can be daunting, and cards riddled with double negatives--reminiscent of political voting ballots. I find this CCG hard to get anyone to play.

RATING: 10
Really awesome expandable card game. My first attempt at one of FFG's living card games was A Game of Thrones and it was very disappointing. It didn't work very well for two players, the rules were badly written and left out a lot of information, and you needed to buy at least two copies of the game just to make it work. Ridiculous.

So I was a little worried about trying this game. So far, though, it has been fantastic. The deck-building is simple and you only have to do as much as you want to do (creating a simple deck just involves combining all the neutral cards with all of a faction's cards) and the game is very replayable right out of the box, without the need to buy a bunch of extra stuff.

Update: Still love this game. There have been about eight data packs and one bigger expansion so far, and the game is still excellent. I was a little worried that the game would be changed too much by that many expansions, but the core gameplay is still pretty much the same, with the extra cards just adding a lot of variety and different strategies. Probably my favorite card game of all time.

Even with just the base set and without doing any real deckbuilding, this game has exceeded all my expectations.

After recently playing a set (one play of each side), my opponent and I were amazed at how tense and how close the match was.

I want all the expansions and I hope to get others into it so I can play against "unknown" decks instead of ones I know about. 

I haven't played a game this unique ever before.

Like others I enjoy the asymmetry of playing the two sides. As a runner, it's fun to charge up and risk a run. As a corporation is fun to bluff and trap your opponent.

However, on the downside, my initial impression is a bad shuffle can considerably hamstring your efforts. With more experience I suspect the mulligan option will be a necessity.

I look forward to more plays.

RATING: 6
What a cool game. I've probably spent more time thinking about it than I have playing it. I really appreciate how having a top-tier deck doesn't mean auto-winning. You have to be able to bluff and call bluffs, learn how to manage your hand, and always be prepared for the worst. The game is very tense, and there's so many cool ways to trick your opponent or get the upper hand. 

On the other hand, Netrunner requires a huge time investment outside of the game. To get the most out of it, you have to constantly tweak decks, follow the meta, etc. I don't mind a bit of customization, but Netrunner is better suited as a lifestyle game.

RATING: 7
A very interesting 2p game, one of the best for 1vs1 aggressive gameplay.

The difference in roles (runners vs corps) is extreme, and the different factions also vary extremelly well. The actual gameplay is engaging, fun and agonising, and the bluffing element is supreme. The core gameplay is extremelly free, which lets the players fully develop their strategies without bothering with unecessary phase details, and the fact that the game works in such a free way is a testament of its supreme design. The deckbuilding aspect is intriguing.

The economy of the game is simple and boring compared to the bluffing element, and the cards that bother with it seem to be there just for the sake of more cards, even if they do make a difference in victory or defeat. The base factions are not very well balanced in the core set, though this is a minor issue in a game that encoureges deck-building. The LCG model is also a money eating problem in competitive games.

Overall, it is a great 2p game but it didn't inspire me to the level I thought it would (the problem of great expectations.) Despite that, it is a great game.

I bumped the score up after more plays. This game definately grows on you. The more intricacies you learn and building your killer decks is a fun process. My only complaint is that the base game leaves almost no room what so ever to customize. You must purchase at least one data pack to have a good wealth of options. The good news is that once you purchase a data pack with your base game it will keep you busy for quite awhile!

RATING: 10
So I'm probably going to have a very different take on this one than most folks who enjoy it. 

What I like: 
-The core gameset! Holy crap is this value for money! So many different factions on both, totally different sides! I was blown away by this. 
-The fact that the gameplay of the two sides are completely different
-Massive replay value and if you want more you can go out and get even more cards
-Lovely mix of bluffing, gambling, playing smart and interesting decisions
-Looks good

What I do not like
-The deck building when purchasing more cards. I do not recommend if you aren't in it to play competitively. I have tried this quite a bit, and it's okay fun, but some of the combos you can make are just ridiculous. With all these different user created decks, sometimes you just face decks that absolutely hard counter yours making this particular game session uninteresting as there is now nothing you can do in the actual game to win. Yeah you can change your deck, but then something else is going to ruin you. To me it is also too much "setting up game/decks" versus actual playing time. Also it gets too expensive and is no longer the amazing value for money that the core set is. 

All in all: I love this!

A very good asymmetrical card game. I'm a big fan of the living card game model compared to collectable card games, even if it does eliminate the rush of opening a rare/valuable card.

This game might be a bit difficult to pick up for someone who hasn't played CCGs before, but players familiar with games like Magic shouldn't have much trouble learning it.

I really like the asymmetrical nature of the two sides in this game. In addition to different mechanics, the two sides encourage different "out of game" skills, such as being deceptive in the case of the Corporation and knowing when to be aggressive in the case of the Runner.

This plays very similar to the original. however the deckbuilding rules are different and the added factions change things up a bit, all positive in my opinion... however this is my first lcg and i was under the impression when you bought a set you got full playsets of all cards... apparently this isnt the case.. not to excited about the prospect of having to buy more then one base set to make a deck

[thing=124742][/thing] is two players a game in which one plays with the runners trying to expose the dirty dealings of the corporations, the side which is played by the other player. The goal for the corporation is to advance its agendas, while the runners want to find them and take them (to use as evidence, I guess), and there are four places in which they can try to do this:
- the headquarters (the hand of cards of the corps player);
- the database (the corps deck);
- the archives (the discard pile);
- and in the search and development (the area in front of the corps player).

Each of these "places" can be proteced by ice - barriers or traps of some kind, putted there to stop the runs. Beside this, the corp can put other traps disguise as agendas, since the ice and agendas go face down in the table - so the game has this bluff element to it. To face this things, the runners have their own tools and ways to play.

Is in this assimetrical way that the game goes on. The actions for each side has similarities, but the deck can be totally different - this is a LCG, after all.

I enjoyed the way the game handles the spatial play area, making everything a point of attention: the discard, the deck, the hand, not only the area in front of the player, which is the norm. Really smart!

So [thing=124742][/thing] is a good game, one that I'm willing to try more times, though certainly won't enter into the madness that it has become! I hope, at least.

Bought it. Learned how to play. Showed wife. She wasn't impressed (theme mostly I think). Put the box on a shelf. Never played it. Still waiting on the right moment to try it.
It is hard with 2p games though. I can play them at lunch at work if they are not too complicated but if they are - I rarely get to bring them to the table.

Ok. Started playing. Got hooked. Spending way to much money on expansions :)

Update again. The game evolves way to fast for me. Unable to keep up I find noone to play with. New players find it too hard to learn the game and I am no fun to play with for players that keep up with all the latest. That is sad cause I really like the game.

Quite a bit of fun and I really enjoy the theme

Doubt I want to get too far into deck building but just the base was enough fun to warrant me playing many more times - 

Need more plays to rate correctly but think it will go up some

Printed the player boards off of here as mousepad mats and goes a very long way to help my enjoyment of the game - almost a must have if you are going to play and a beginner since it helps you visualize what the hell is going on

It's expensive to get on board with, incredibly hard to learn, and all-consuming. 

But it is also the best game I've every played. And continue to play.

RATING: 6.5
The rating is for the base game only, not the system. I actually had a pretty fun time playing Netrunner for an evening. However, even after 3 plays I was seeing that the fun would get stale pretty quick without expanding the game. like so many FF games, the core set offers only a taste. This would be fine if it cam with tapas pricing, but the price of the core set sees it competing with many richer game experiences. This is a very expensive lifestyle game, and I'm not ready to dive into the deep end yet.

RATING: 5
The jargon is rather annoying and the text on some of the cards is a bit opaque at times. Why call a hand of cards a deck, and the discard pile the archive? It's unnecessary when simple clear language would have worked better. As far as I can see the only justification is to try and shoehorn a paper thin theme onto the card game. The game itself is fiddly, utterly inelegant and let down by a poorly written rulebook. 

Having said all of that though, once you're past the nomenclature barrier, it is fast and fun. I just don't think that's enough in an overcrowded collection of games. There are many more interesting and enjoyable games to be played which don't require the large investment of time and effort to learn. 

Sold my copy, unfortunately in the end it came down to the use of annoying terms when simpler language would suffice was probably the straw that broke the camel's back.

RATING: 8.5
If theme is what you like, there is no way this game can disappoint. From  game design to extensive card descriptions, Android is incredibly immersive. It's asymmetrical game play also makes it very unique. Never thought a cyberpunk futuristic dystopia was a setting I'd enjoy so much. Go figure. 

Warning -- getting through the rules can be taxing at first, and then bordering on annoying by the end. The cards also have extensive descriptions so game play can be slow while players are making their decisions. Play only when you have ample time on your hands.

Believe the hype! I see a feeding frenzy at Gen Con 2012 over Netrunner. I see it is rocketing up the BGG charts. I look at a few of the videos and reviews and it looks like it might be fun. Not on the top of my wish list and I'm not a fan of constructing decks. But I have received a gift card to my FLGS and use it to buy the game. 

After a few plays, Netrunner is all I want to play and there are plenty of opponents available. This game is intense. It is surprisingly easy to learn and I like that you have to play your opponent as well as your cards. Very much like poker or launching / repelling an invasion in a war game.

I have played this game since its FFG release in 2012, and still love it. This was also my first introduction to the LCG model, which I have found to be a big improvement over the old days of MtG, or Decipher's Star Trek TNG CCG. 

It has been a rocky road at times, but with the game's third lead designer completing the rollout of the revised core set, a removed/restricted list and the latest MWL the game has been much improved. We all survived the first rotation, and are enjoying the most recent cycle of new cards. The deck-building aspect is challenging but exciting, and there's nothing better than assembling a combo for a strong play.

Will probably play this game until its gone.

Never played Magic. Didn't really care for it. 

Played the Pokemon CCG, but when I say play, I mean collected (kid with pocket money and obsessions, fool I was).

Netrunner however, is in a league of it's own. I don't own or play any other LCG/CCG-model games so I can't compare it to the other heavy hitters like L5R or... um... my point exactly. When I say league of it's own I am talking about the game experience itself, not it's business model or it's theme or even mechanisms. 

This game is one of the most satisfying things I can do with my time, should I choose to play a game. Whether it lasts 10 minutes or 50, win or lose, I can always find peace and satisfaction within the experience. 

You are truly allowed to express yourself in the way you play, not just in how you build your deck and the rules you like to bend with your card choices but at the table and how you look your opponent in the eye and declare with a quiver "I'm going to install this card here...", trying to convey both the truth and a lie at the same time. Or as the runner, staring grimly at the increasing walls of ice in front of you blocking you from your goals, your mind races between the decisions, weighing your risks and rewards until finally you decide it's time to reveal that card from your hand that you have had since the beginning. It's time to run on the big one. It's time to get stupid.

The caveat here is you really need to play with people you like. Some people build annoying decks that will rub you the wrong way and they WILL sit smugly across from you and drink your rage like a fine wine, but most of all this game is truly an intimate experience between two people because of the nature of preparation that goes into it. Onlookers can do little but look on in silent awe as a game unfolds as the Magic Circle in this realm only has two seats. 
Play with your friends, play with people in your game group, play competitively if you want to but be WARNED. This game is deep and serious. It is intricate and vastly convoluted. It is not complicated to understand and it is not detached from it's theme in a way that makes the game mechanisms jarring to learn (quite the opposite in fact!), it will take time and many, many games before you understand how to weigh your options correctly (and even then there is always a generous helping of "listen to your heart" decisions), you will also need to build a number of different decks before you see how they fit together in a way you like.
In short, the barrier to entry is very high. Which brings me to my rating. This game is a faux-10 for me. It has all the qualities of a perfect game, but the lacking quality may just be me... Allow me to ramble:

The game cannot score a 10 because of how it grows. I will not always be around to pick up the next data pack or deluxe expansion. I will not always have the time to read over every card and be aware that the rules can now be bent in that way. This is not a detriment to the game, in fact it is incredible that the game continues to grow and thrive. It is amazing that there will be new styles of play and new tricks and secrets to tuck away into a deck and unleash on some poor soul who thought that "today seems like a good day to start a nice little mega-corp". This only means that the Netrunner that I know and love will not always be there. It will not always be the Netrunner that is being played in stores and tournaments, and talked about across various ports of the interwebs.
The Netrunner I rate a 10 is already dead. It shed it's perfect outer layer and has been happily living as a 9. It will do so for some time, I imagine, until another game is able to capture this feeling for me.

This feeling. 

This game has a unique feeling that is separate from the satisfaction of being a walking lexicon of card effects. It is more than the fluid execution of a well-crafted deck, or the elated victory found at the bottom of a well-guarded server. It surpasses these things and becomes something more. You FEEL like a cyber-punk runner, geared to the teeth with hardware build for all occasions, your mind buzzing with access codes to software installed across a myriad of devices as your terminal light washes you with a pale white glow. You receive a call from your associate, the goods have arrived, tonight is the night, you may only have one chance to get past that wall while the filthy corp only has chump change to spare on rezzing half-assed ice you know you could break with basic algorithmic execution. 

This game is reaching a zenith for me, it will begin to set on my life and I would encourage anyone interested to jump in before... oh I dunno... the end of 2015? By then the barrier to entry should bar out almost all but the most committed, the ones who were late to the party and don't mind playing catch-ups. For the rest. Get in now before the corp puts up the next wall of ice and you find yourself short on the time and the creds needed to get what you really want..

First a disclaimer: I know I am not the targeted audience for LCCs', but I was intrigued at the hype for Netrunner. The game concept and theme is very well developed. The terminology for the game, while tough for a newbie to parse and digest, is nevertheless extremely thematic and bursting with flavor. ICE, agendas, main frame, subroutines....etc. everything makes so much sense taken in the context of the game and actions. Heck, "meat" damage sounds so alluring.

My two plays were mediocre at best. The one thing about all LCCs in general is the amount of time and energy that is invested in learning to play the game and playing it well. Even for the core game without any expansions, the variety is astounding. However, multiple plays are required for any two players to appreciate the game design. Therein lies the biggest issue for me: I just don't have the time nor energy to invest in multiple game plays. Hence, I am not the target audience. I find that the runner breaking through the barriers installed by the corporation to be really cool, but boils down to dumb luck as to which card is drawn. An agenda scores you points. Anything else is a waste of time. Each run can cost multiple credits and these hard earned credits can result in a spectacular bust. Toward the latter half of the game, I felt that each turn boils down to earning credits either to setup a run or to score agendas.

Not my cup of tea but I can appreciate the game design.

This is damn near perfect. 50+ games in and I'm really starting to accept and like the game for what it is, which is by and large a bluffing game with a small amount of deck building. My initial issue was that I approached the game with those last two reversed, and got my hopes repeatedly crushed as wins and losses came down to much more luck than I was expecting.

That said, now that I've had this many games to really explore how the game works, I've come to accept how the strategy/luck balance plays out and have adjusted my expectations accordingly. The amount of effort deckbuilding requires vs. how easy it is for games to come down to a coin flip still bothers me, but the variety of the card pool keeps me coming back for more.

Very preliminary thoughts after one introductory play: I really enjoyed the theme and it is well implemented. Asymmetry is cool too. I'm undecided about the mechanics atm. They felt ok, but didn't excite that much. For example, somehow the 4 actions round sturcture didn't put my pants on fire... But we'll see after few plays how it turns out!

very very good card game.it convinces you to be a hacker or an evil corp.so much bluff and hand management.although the two sides play totally diffirent  they are well balanced.the fact that you can make your own deck gives the game tons of replayability.play time is among 15-45 minutes.i think the corp is a liiiittle bit over power compared to the runner.the luck aspect from drawing cards from your deck can ruin your strategy and thats the only disadvantage i found on the game.

This was really fun when it came out. Exploring it was great and it was quite the adventure. After a bad experience with the local community around here, I ended up falling out of the scene.

I did end up trying some new decks after a few more data packs came out. I didn't realise Netrunner had changed so much! It felt like a completely different beast and not for the better.

This game highlighted a serious flaw of the LCG model. While it's definitely nice to be able to get access to all the cards without having to chase cards on the secondary market, the fact that the packs simply do not add enough cards to influence the metagame is a serious flaw. 

Not only this, but without rotation, the metagame ends up getting stale without substantial deck innovation. I'm not sure how Netrunner ended up the way it is now, but it was definitely way more enjoyable when it first came out. It's now become a combo heavy field, with no end in sight.

Update 6/11/14: Looks like I called it? FFG just announced a rotation policy for their LCGs. I wonder if there will be any backlash considering the fact you now have to constantly buy cards like a CCG. After finding out about the details, the rotation policy seems half baked. Not too sure why the big boxes don't rotate too, nor why the rotation is so far apart. This is still going to have all the issues I raised, and with every additional big box addition, it's just going to add to the bloat.

Update 9/11/14: Looks like the backlash is here.

Update 8/07/15: I'm never going to play this game ever again, so the updated rating reflects that. The fact that rotation is so slow and that the number of cards added has either too much impact or no impact at all is a downside in my eyes. The cost is a huge issue too, irrespective of the LCG model.

Big props to FFG for listening to the community and going through the trouble to license and reprint this fantastic game. The 1996 original was [i]way[/i] ahead of its time, with fascinating asymmetry and a ton of bluffing and psychology. The main obstacle to playing it was availability, compounded by the loopy deckbuilding rules for constructed play that allowed unlimited copies of a single card. In recreating NR as an LCG, FFG neatly solved both of those problems. The result preserves 99% of what made the original NR great while finally making the game accessible to non-fanatics. The minor mechanical differences are irrelevant IMO, just different takes on the same idea. I do agree with the criticism that the reboot lacks some of the charm of the original's art and flavor text, which was quirky in the way that games often used to be before they became such a well-defined industry. However, the FFG aesthetics are fine - a bit slick and manufactured, but not so much so that they detract from the game.

All that being said, A:NR is still not a game for everybody. Many of the mechanics are unique, and the asymmetric gameplay makes it impossible for new players to learn the game simply by copying his opponent's moves. The game takes a little patience and some genuine interest to get into. The core set helps with that by providing an excellent out-of-the-box experience with the premade factions. But still... this is much more of a gamer's game than simple MtG decks provide.

Finally, while the core set is clearly looking ahead to the expansion packs and serious constructed play, I think there's plenty of value here even without buying anything else. With so much of the gameplay dependent on bluffing and hidden information, you can easily play just the basic Shaper/Jinteki matchup numerous times. Add in the other faction match-ups, tweak a few cards through the deckbuilding rules, and you've got more than enough gameplay here to justify the cost.

A beautiful game where mechanics and theme are intertwined through and through. You play this game. You pilot your deck. The deck does NOT play you. 

Didn't draw the card you wanted? Just use an action to draw up. Don't have resources? Use actions to get them. Analyze the board. Make your move. 

No boosters. No expensive decks. You can probably own most or all of the cards for less then the highest tier Magic decks, and that's for EVERY card with 3 copies. 

There is ONE problem, though- the Core Set. Though it is great to get into the game, it is a bain for competitive players. You have to buy about 2 or 3 because the Core Set only contains 1-ofs of certain important cards.

It's a problem, but that doesn't stop Netrunner from being my favorite card game of all time.

This game is really hard for me to rate.

It's incredibly executed and fun to play. The asymmetrical play, the variety of cards, the cat and mouse game, it's all amazing. But that only works once you understand it.

But trying to figure out this game takes a ridiculous amount of dedication. It's great that the language is authentic (I assume it is, anyway, having never been a hacker), but some straightforward explanation of what the cards do would be really helpful.

Fantasy Flight's videos saved us from getting really angry, but many plays in, I'm still consulting the rulebook. That's tiring.

RATING: 9
Love it. We only have 2 base sets, and a couple of expansions, but I love the way it plays. Every game is tense (unless it's over really quickly) due to the way agendas are scored. endless variety. I wish we had other people to play with, but it is still good with the 2 of us building decks and facing off against each other.

RATING: 2
Highly luck based, doesn't really fix the issues I have with most card games. The rules are a mess and the game/cards are not very intuitive for new players (although I am not a "new player") Constant release of new sets is both a plus and minus.  I also feel like the BGG rating system is being abused to raise this game more then it should.

En principio era un juego que no me atraía nada, pero fue jugar las dos primeras partidas y descubrir como de distintas eran las sensaciones al jugar de un bando o de otro. Mi preferido es jugar como corporación porque me produce dos cosas o mucha risa o mucho estrés, me encanta engañar, o ver como irremediablemente el runner consigue romper los hielos y va a ganar la partida. La función del runner es atacar, atacar y atacar, no le queda otra. Casi siempre en tensión porque nunca sabe lo que se va a encontrar por el camino o al llegar al objetivo final.

I've got a total of 6 plays in now, pretty much exclusively with the recommended start Corp and Netrunner.  Haven't been blown away with the game like other people on this site.  I've noticed I keep getting credit screwed, giving me a very Magic "mana screwed" vibe... and I have had much more fun playing magic over this.  My opponent mentioned he'd rather play Magic.  :P

Still, I'm going to keep trying to play this game and see if it gets any better.

RATING: 8.5
2-player asymmetrical card game: cyberpunk hackers trying to steal data and resources from online mega-corporations. The list of potential cards to include in your deck grows continually, but does not require purchase of random card packs. Instead, the game expands with fixed card packs on a regular basis. Best for players dedicated to repeat plays of the same game.

I enjoy playing runner and corp equally, and mainly play Jinteki (corp) or Kit/Dinosaur (runner) decks. One of my favorite features of this game is that every card pack has set cards, nothing random. This helps eliminate the pay-to-play feel of other deckbuilders or Trading Card Games like Magic. With Netrunner, you know that if you win or lose, it's about skill and practice, not rarity of cards.

Tense asymmetrical cyberpunk two-player LCG. Love playing it, but find it hard to get motivated to get around to deck-building. Love the theme. 

With the combination of expansions and data packs I currently own, I'm finding the runner wins a lot more often than the corp. Thinking of expanding more with more corp-centric cards when I have the funds.

There's a lot of conflicting information on what the best decks to start with as new players are. We chose a recommended setup that we found on the forums here, and if he hadn't chosen not to, my partner would have flat-lined me on his second turn. So maybe that one needed some work. :P

Will probably increase score after I get more playtime in and find out if the higher strategies are more fun.  As it was with starter recommendations there were too many "well it is or it isn't" gambles that will end the game with one player as the winner and the other as loser but not much strategy went into the decision (for example hitting traps off the random deck or hitting a scoring agenda to finish the 7 points off - neither player controlled which occurred the runner just knew one was likely to happen accessing the top 3 cards.)

Being a fan of the first one I had high hopes, and was not disappointed.  

All plays of base game include the expansions as well, they are added as they come out.  (Currently own up to and including "All that Remains")

The expansions have come out so fast it's easy to fall behind unless this is the only thing I am keeping tabs on.  I love the game but am discovering I don't like maintaining decks and the constantly changing environment.  Rating lowered to reflect that part of the experience even though I do rate the actual playing of the game high.

RATING: 6
I miss the darker, goofier art from the original, but the world here is more cohesive, and benefits from a universe that is used outside this particular game, notably in the original [gameid=39339] boardgame and even some novels.  The gameplay here is crisp, and the deckbuilding is good.  the thing is, I find myself less enthused with every play.  The only way you're going to get interest out of this game is by going into deck-building with this game, and that's going to require a heavy investment in new cards.  It may be an LCG, meaning that you can be guaranteed to get all the cards by buying certain packages, but that doesn't really fix the fact that you still have to buy a ton of product.

After a couple plays with 'What Lies Ahead' and having one of the most tense and thrilling games I ever played, this shot up a few decimal places. (9.3 to 9.5)
Finally released myself from my comfort zone and played as the runner. I think I'll up the score, because it just keeps getting better and better. (9.5 to 9.6)
One of my most recent games was such and up and down thrill ride. Every trick in the book was pulled and the tables were turned at least three times. Such an amazing game. Getting more time with different runner factions and expansions. I'm giving the game a 9.8.
I honestly can't measure the quality of this game. I'm always finding myself in more creative and exciting games one after the other. Game is getting a 10. Pretty much perfect.

Comment after one game as a netrunner. The game mechanics feel good and clear, but our game ended quite soon, so it's hard to say anything for sure. My game was looking quite good, but then I made a run to the server, which allowed the corporation to deal some serious net damage to me, which ended the game. Before that I was leading 3-2.

Cards and other components are pretty, cyberpunk theme is good.

This game is awesome. The only CCG I enjoy more is the old Star Wars CCG created by Decipher. The main knock is that it's too complex and intense. And it can certainly be that way, no doubt. The game and the community have a huge competitive slant. I'm not much of a fan of that, so I take measures to keep it light-hearted, like limiting the card pool available to build decks from.

Regardless though, this is one of the coolest games I have ever played. The ideas, the application of theme, the production, the art, etc. is all top-notch.

RATING: 9
Netrunner is a fantastic asymmetrical game between a Runner "Hacker" and Mega Corporations "Corps". The back and forth between the Runner and the Corp starts as soon as the game does. Lots of bluffing on both sides with interesting game play on either side.
With the LCG format more and more cards are being introduced to the Meta allowing for customized deck building and increasing the variety from match to match. 
The Artwork and lots of flavor text on the cards really captures the dystopian "Cyberpunk" future. 
FFG has really modernized this title and brought it back much better than before.

*** PERMANENT PLACE IN COLLECTION

UPDATE: We realised Jinteki was weak and Jon preferred playing the runner. After six plays, I really like this game - it isn't just bluffing. Jon remains to be convinced. He thinks it's a decent game but nowhere like a perfect 10.

UPDATE: After four plays, I'd rather play BattleCON or Yomi for advanced bluffing with combat. The unexpanded base pack has less depth and I think it depends heavily on deck-building. The appeal seems to be theme.

Massively impressed after two plays. It's like playing Magic the Gathering where the only colour is blue and it's developed to the hilt. Loads of control, mind games and bluffing.

The starter kit feels a bit thin, even after two plays. I could do with some more cool cards, I think.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Played casually out of the box it is about getting the most out of a random stream of cards with lots of special powers; plus blind bluffing and outguessing. If you are into deck construction and "tournament" play it may be interesting and very good, but I am not so this is not at all for me.

Objectively, the game is probably much better than my personal very low rating, but as I have absolutely no interest in playing it again so be it.

I never played the original Netrunner, so I don't know how this version compares to it (other than it being non-collectible), but I like the way it works.  The asymmetrical play is a big draw, and I haven't played enough of it yet to get a good feel for how balanced it is, and I like that the theme of the game works with the mechanisms.  It's a helpful reminder for how the game flows, and pretty cool, to boot.  It's been a long time since I've played any CCG-ish game, and this one is different enough that it doesn't feel much like one, so I imagine it will be a while before I get around to the deck-building elements of the game.  For now, though, I'm intrigued.

There are a lot of things I like about the game: Interaction is very high, and there is an appropriate mixture of luck and strategy. The rules and strategies are easy enough, that no analysis paralysis is to be feared, and the playtime is very moderate. Since I am married to a gamer, two player games are always very welcome with me. Just ask my husband and on it goes. :-)

Wonderful artwork and the theme is likeable, too. The very distinct mechanisms for the two opponents is fun and adds to the replay value - along with the fractions and light deck building integrated into the core game. I am no fan of extensive deck building. I prefer the actual playing over the planning and strategising just with the rules and probabilities. Fortunately with LCG I can easily avoid that. I just don't buy any extensions - maybe one later when the desire for more variety awakes.

Another LCG money sink. The asymmetrical gameplay is great, and the out of box variety in the core set is superb. I find the whole cyber punk theme very cool. When you play as the runner you actually feel like you're hacking into a system, as the corporation you try to accomplish your own devious agendas, while trying to keep the runners from accessing the servers by securing them with ICE. I love all the cunning and bluffing.

RATING: 10
The original Netrunner had a serious cult following and Fantasy Flight's re-imagining of the classic game has shown everyone just why that happened. The game's mechanisms convey the theme extremely well and playing feels like you are engaged in a hacker vs. internet security cyber-war. Not only that, but the gameplay features loads of bluffing and allows you to actually play your opponent, not just his online crafted netdeck. Skill wins out, almost every time.

So what's different about Netrunner? Most of what you know about deck construction doesn't apply in this game. Often times it can be beneficial to build a tool box of one-offs as opposed to multiple copies of power cards. If you run into a deck that features a combo that you aren't equipped for...YOU CAN STILL WIN! You can bluff, misdirect and steal a victory anyway. Which is precisely why this game has such a stellar reputation.

Very similar to the original, which is good in that there wasn't very much wrong with the original - but still a missed opportunity to reduce the game length and/or streamline some of the more needlessly complex bits (there are a LOT of rules, and it seems like they could be condensed a little without significantly narrowing the decision tree). I like the theme, but the art and flavor are still a bit of a turn-off - again, like the original. I'm not totally sold on the LCG model being significantly better than CCGs - though at least you can buy a single box and have some customization options for lots of casual games, which is more than you can say about most CCGs.

But overall, it's one of the better card games I've played. I'd definitely recommend anyone try it if they aren't afraid of a learning curve or a little time investment outside of the game.

Utterly fantastic. My new go-to for 1v1 card games. The game manages to hit that remarkable ability to be a card game that isn't all about luck and deckbuilding, but actually game play and interaction between the players. And unlike previous LCG games I've played in the past, the Core Set has enough cards for intelligent deck building and enough variety to keep the game fresh for a long time. Anyone who likes to play competitive card games should give this game a try it is phenomenal.

Easy to pick up and the asymmetrical play between the runner and the corp is really interesting. The different runner decks could use a little better balancing and the card layouts are (while pretty) inconsistent and a tad visually confusing, but this is overall my favorite 2-player game. Replay value is great.

I used to love this game, but I got burned out on it.  It was the psi games (essentially a rock-paper-scissors minima) that ruined it for me.  I also thought the release schedule was too aggressive and I'd only have about 3 weeks to feel like I had fully digested the new cards before having to buy another pack.

All that said, it is an amazing game and if you are looking to get into an LCG, you can't really go wrong with Netrunner.

I am getting into this game. I think its biggest weakness may be the scoring method, despite how clever it is.

Great asymmetry and deck building is really fun. Simple limits on cards from other factions make the restrictions simpler and less luck-reliant than deck building with typed resources.

I was never a huge fan of cyberpunk settings. I'm always fine with it but I never seek it out.

So when I say they get the theme/feel of this game down really well, I mean it.

The core set is basic, yes, but it's a great starting point to get new gamers and M:TG pros alike aligned on how this game works.


Watch the YouTube video on how to play this game. The rule book is very hard to get through, and you're going to need to give it a few solid reads before the rules really start to click.

The cyberpunk theme is great. The game itself showed promise, but I think this will take a few more plays to "get it," as we kind of stumbled through the rules during the initial playthroughs (rather than learning them beforehand). The layout of cards in play is kind of awkward; the game could really benefit from some sort of play mats to keep card placement consistent.

Playtested this one, which was exciting but also frustrating (I was right about Account Siphon, among several other things). Some good things, certainly, and great to have it back in print. Not sold on the new trace mechanism, but then, not sold on the old one either. Factions came out pretty nicely, though Criminal's lack of breakers still grates. And the lack of run-ending ice still annoys (there's still too much "trick" ice).

But the overall package is (fairly) balanced and appealing. However, deckbuilding is required, and that's a huge strike for me. I created and tested a good [thread=1069815]deal-and-play variant[/thread] that will only improve as sets deepen, but it's harder to simulate a (non-existent) starter box in this brave new LCG world. 

As to the game itself, it's brilliant. Great blend of luck and skill, deeply asymmetrical, lives up to Garfield's own statement that "in Magic your cards play you, while in NR you play your cards". I'm a little disappointed that any form of fast advance has been allowed to flourish, but it's a better constructed experience now than in the original game, where there was just too much leeway for degeneracy.

I was hesitant to play Netrunner because of how crazy I went over Magic when I initially tried that CCG. Now with Android Netrunner being an LCG, there are differences, sure. But I was wary. Well, a friend of mine finally taught me the game, and it was really fun. I love the theme of hacking into megacorps and stealing their data, and the artwork does wonders for the theme. I love asynchronous play, and this game has it in spades. Something I'd like to continue to try, for sure (though not going to go crazy like I did with Magic), and I'll probably end up purchasing the starter set and a few expansions soonish.

An asymmetrical card game, where one players is a mega coorperation that build servers, the other is a hacker/runner trying to hack the coorperation. 
The coorperation must defend themself quick, but the runner must watch out not to fall into an ambush.
A deck building game like Magic, but with a very different flow and theme. There are many strategies to pick from, and part of the fun is making your own desc to pit it against other players.

This is an excellent two player card game.  

My problem is that I hate deckbuilding.  I just don't want to invest that much time into a game.  So, if FFG could find a way to release sort of a slightly more complete set of decks that I could play with now and again without messing with the deckbuilding, the rating might go up a point.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Strategic, engrossing, thematic, exciting...This is easily the best 2-player game, card or otherwise, that I have played. 

I only have the core set, one major expansion and one data pack and I feel I can be very competitive with people who have subscribed from the beginning.

Deckbuilding is fun for me, so I love that aspect. (If you 1/10 haters don't like deckbuilding, why did you buy the freakin' game?) But I like that in A:NR, a great deck piloted by a bad player will likely still lose. Decks don't win the game by themselves. The game is about 30% deck and 70% player skill.

I've read people's comments that there is no strategy involved beyond bluffing, but I just simply don't see how that's true. Choosing whether or not to spend that last click to get money or to make a run can literally win or lose you the game. And there are hundreds of those decisions every match. It's very complex and rewarding and absolutely requires strategy.

Yes, the technical jargon is a bit overwhelming at first, but its certainly not impossible. I read the rulebook about two times through before my first match and felt like I had a pretty good handle on the mechanics. Not everyone will pick it up as fast as the next, and it definitely helps to have someone who has played before many times with you, but it's not as bad as everyone makes it sound.

The fact that its got a tough learning curve and that the box design for the core set is just plain bad is the only reason I knocked off a 0.5 point. 

I'm not going to take points off because of the money-sink in the expansions and data packs. It's a collectible card game (LCG format doesn't change that, just makes it more fair) and its clear that's what you are getting into from the start.

The sheer variety and really impressive asymmetrical nature make this game a perfect fit for my gaming sensibilities. Yet, what raises Netrunner above most other CCG/LCGs that I've played is the level of impact of the meta-game. While smart deck-building and good draws do play a part in Netrunner as in most other games of its kind, a clever player will take advantage of the bluff/double-bluff element, meaning that raw luck-of-the-draw can be mitigated by careful duping of your opponent. I like that factor a lot and that's why I have to give Netrunner high marks.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Absolutely amazing game. In most respects better than the original and the team they have on this is doing Garfield's original design justice. 

My favorite game to come out in years if not my entire life.

UPDATE: 7 months in and I play this more now than when I first got it. The new isn't close to worn off and I get new people to play with every day. Couldn't be happier with this one (unless maybe organized play came together a little more organically).

UPDATE: Still the best game in my collection - passed over 300 plays and I still won't turn down a game.

UPDATE 2/5/2014: I'm approaching 400 plays now and it isn't close to getting stale. New data packs are something I always look forward to.

UPDATE 6/1/2015: Still the most played game in my collection. And it still surprises me every time I play it. LOVE this game.

UPDATE 5/12/2016: I don't play it nearly as much as I used to but that is because of lack of time + a new infant in the house. The game is still intriguing and I'm still buying multiples of every pack that releases. Still the most fun you can have in ~40 minutes.

Very thematic with a functional asymmetry. Has somewhat of a learning curve with the core mechanics not to even mention the additional data packs.

Highly tematic game. The rules at first are impossible, too much terminology; follow some good tutorial on the net, play some turns and everything becomes much much clearer.

After 102 plays, this is probably my absolute favorite two player game. The limiting factor of the game is the knowledge of the other player, so a regular group is key. Having played with only one other player for ~75 games, a meta of 2 is an option, but you really want more than that for the variety of opponents and decks. Additionally, the game [i]can be[/i] expensive: two core sets (three if you can swing it) and one of every expansion is going to run you near $200.

However, I did say that this is my absolute favorite two player game and I mean it. Let's get the obvious qualities out of the way: the asymmetric play is a wonderful breath of fresh air. One player is the runner—the hacker—and it's their job to get in and steal agendas from the evil corporation who's either bluffing or attempting to keep the runner out. The runner is constantly prodding and poking the servers, trying to find vulnerabilities and installing programs that allow him to breakthrough the ICE subroutines. The corporation meanwhile is trying to fool the runner to run on traps or damaging sentries. 

The fact that each side is so different is the most compelling part of this game, but that's not everything:

- The deckbuilding options are always increasing with an ever expanding cardpool thanks to a regular release schedule of known cards
- The flexibility of play styles are huge: you can sit back and build up a rig, poke and prod early, or try something wildly different; you can build up huge walls of ICE, hurt the runner, make the runner hurt themselves, or find lateral ways of using resources to your benefit
- Economy is a huge factor and it's not always as simple as it seems, there are times when you want less money and there are times when you want more money, pay attention!

If I could only own one game, it would be Cosmic Encounter, but if I could only own two, it would probably be Cosmic and Netrunner.

After nearly 300 games, I'm starting to lose steam and interest. It's still a very good game mechanically, but I've lost almost all interest in building decks.

Love the theme and the bluffing element of the game. Not the easiest game to learn due to a lot of rules. But once you get your head around it, it is a ton of fun.

This game really should come with a player mat. Got some custom printed for myself and it helps.

Would get a higher score if they could have somehow made it easier to learn/teach without the game losing anything and included a nice player mat.

Edit: After playing this more, found that luck played too much of a role in it, so decided to trade it.

RATING: 10
[Full Disclosure: I have been playing the original Netrunner card game since it came out in 1996, and have in this time logged hundreds of multi-hour games. As such, I am both biased to love the core gameplay, and to be skeptical of changes to the formula.  With that said...]

Android: Netrunner is excellent, featuring many well-motivated design improvements over the original game, while still remaining extremely faithful.

PROS (relative to original):
- New setting is both coherent and compelling
- LCG format is more accessible and easy to get your friends to play
- Identity cards connect me to the setting and story, provide base link, and give the corp something to put ice in front of when defending HQ
- Factioning creates better sense of character/flavor mid-game, constrains/speeds-up deck-building for the better
- New simplified trace/link system removes deck filler, streamlines encounters, has similar feel to the original
- New ICE and agenda cards are wildly more varied and interesting
- The art is actually good!  The original was extremely hit-or-miss, but its charm and fundamental aesthetic signatures are preserved

CONS (relative to original):
- Not a lot of cards yet, so deckbuilding isn't particularly satisfying (though this will almost certainly change as the expansions are released)
- Game is still hard to learn, despite excellent new manual and streamlined rules
- Flavor text isn't as strong as in the original '96 release

All in all, a masterful reboot.  If the expansions remain solid, this game may supplant the original as my favorite 2-player game.

I too enjoy mostly medium games and fillers with the occasional heavier game thrown into the mix.
I played Android: Netrunner 4 times now. I love its asymmetrical gameplay and that it can be quick, once you know the cards. I definitely see why it's considered the best LCG for two players. However, I find the theme quite okay, but not overwhelmingly good.
But my biggest gripe with it, is that can't teach new people very easily, as the terminology is just absurdly unnecessary. Just call it a draw pile, for Pete's sake! You really need to know all cards to have a decent chance at winning. Without deckbuilding it's just not as much fun.
I think there are better 2-player games out there, atleast for me.

Cyberpunk hackers jacking corporate data guarded by lethal security defense systems. Willing to risk it all to foil greedy capitalist agendas, for personal profit and just because they can.

Essentially not having what you need when you need it.  For us, wins are often determined by who had the best shuffle.  I'm sure the pro's have this figured out.

This game just is not for me. I don't really know what about it I dislike so much. It isn't a game I hate it just has not gone over well in 2-3 plays. It seemed mostly that the "starter decks" described in the instructions were definitely suited to play against a specific counter part. Otherwise several cards would be entirely dead. Granted this game is meant to promote deck building prior to play but this experience made me very disinterested in digging that deep in the game. There is more than enough to learn in the game besides the somewhat convoluted rules for building decks. I think in the right scenario I may have liked this much more but I simply can't recommend it.

Right now, the deckbuilding is pretty forced with strategies that simply don’t have the depth of cardpool required to be effective.

Very fun. Can be stressful or casual depending on the mood.

Jon bought this first, and we played a few times. They were all extremely stressful matches, and I absolutely loved it. We were so busy with finishing our majors though.

(Plus, we were playing his game of Thunderstone when we had more time). 

I eventually got it myself and play it every once in a while. I love it, but I rarely get someone to play it with me (most likely because of the deck building and learning-each-card aspect of the game).

Netrunner has gone through growing pains after a few stellar years. Design problems with some cards caused the 2016 tournaments to see reduced attendance. FFG addressed some of the most unbalanced card combinations and the game is back on better footing  with more competitive builds. Another issue that has caused me to lower the rating is that the barriers to entry are not insignificant. To get into the game in a more than casual way requires a few hundred dollars and dedication.

Only slight point off could be the LCG/CCG thing. I know I know they are different in the sense you know what you're a getting...but it's still a money pit.
Sure you know what you're getting into when you dip your toes into the LCG pool. And arguably people say that you can select the expansions you need. For many who are in this hobby though, they suffer from a completionist attitude and find it hard to skip expansions.
For myself though, I'll continue to collect until I've built a number of reasonable decks and or noone wants to play any further.

Having only tried a few games with the standard decks, I can assert that Netrunner is an unexpectedly good combination of bluffing, luck, gumption, and fragility.  Our games went slightly longer than expected, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.

If I can arrange back-to-back sessions of Android and Netrunner on the same day, those will be hours well spent.  I don't play much of either game with adults, but as kid-adult shared experiences both are top of the line.

Bonus: I'll never get into deckbuilding with Netrunner, as the unexpanded base game is more than enough for my own casual purposes.  That's a huge sigh of relief given the time and money that I spent on M:TG years ago.

Love the cyberpunk feel.
Great head to head dueling with cards.

I like that you do feel the battle.
The intensity of: 
"Which card is the right one to go after?"
"Is it a trap?"
"Can I afford to rez that ice if I need it?"
"You got rid of all my credits?"
"What do you mean you get to see 6 from my R&D?!?!?!"

There is an upkeep cost but everyone gets the same cards. No going through random packs looking for that 1 special "MtG type" card.
I am in a weekly play group and like to play at least 1 tourney a month.

Love to play. I own, and see myself playing for a long time to come.

I remember liking this game a lot when it was the CCG. But it did not resonate with me this time. I'd be willing to give it another chance, and it certainly wasn't bad. But I'd rather play many card games than Netrunner.

RATING: 5
The original was possibly the best implementation of a theme in CCG game mechanics that I can think of.  Its awesome that the corp's hand, deck and discards are all hackable servers.

this isnt really that game.  its got a few of its core things going on but its all about the gimmick mechanics of each of the themed factions in typical FFG style.

if you thought call of cthulhu was a great game you will love this.

the good :

• The art is good (the design is an abysmal vomit of stylization)
• The back of the card makes it fairly obvious which direction the cards are facing which is nice when you are obsessive about shuffling so that the cards all face the same way.

the bad :
• The choice to make 'factions' hurts playability in that no runner or corp deck feels as functional as it should (did.)  The goal to add unique faction flavors has superseded the goal of good game, good mechanics, and that is par for the course with FFG.  

• The card design is an abysmal vomit of stylization (the art is good)
• The card stock is not great
• LCG

The more I revisit Android Netrunner the less enthusiastic I am about it. I haven't been able to get into the deck building and while the core mechanics are neat other asymmetric games have supplanted it in my collection.

This review is based on the core set alone. I've played a lot of Netrunner, both casually and in a tournament, setting and it's a great game overall but the core set has some flaws. The factions in the core set are not balanced. Criminal, Haas Bioroid, and Wayland are over powered compared to the other core factions. You do not see this in other games like the Summoner Wars Master Set. I feel like anyone who wants to enjoy Netrunner long term will need to invest in a few data packs (expansions) to give it replay-ability. Cards like Plascrete Carapace and Jackson Howard fix fundamental flaws in the core set but this also adds $30 to the price tag. 

If I were to rate "Netrunner" as a whole I'd give it a 9.5. The game is incredibly balanced and so far FFG has done a great job making sure there is no power creep in the card pool. I own 2 cores and every data pack (as of Lunar Cycle) but the core set itself falls short as an "out of the box" standalone experience. Games like Summoner Ward and Lord of the Rings the Card Game provide a much more rounded out of the box experience.

Incredible cool card game. I like the fact that both players play with different goals in mind, and also the constant pressure you feel from the other player. Most of the time, I feel like I'm loosing while my opponent feels the same way. Great tention to have! 

Also the ability to bluff as the Corp player is a nice option in the game. Are you willing to risk hacking into a server, knowing that the Corp player might have laid a trap there for you? Or that he might be bluffing that it's a trap and actually going to the win?

Its kinda stupid though that they haven't included 3 copies of each card in the base set. It doesn't mesh well with the while LCG idea!

RATING: 9
8 Plays: Very cool asymmetrical game. We haven't even gotten to the deckbuilding part and I like it a lot. Turns move pretty quickly and there's a good amount of variety and difference between games. The factions mostly behave differently and each have a different flavor. At first, I thought the game was slightly too long but I don't feel that way anymore. It's actually pretty crazy how much this feels like a board game and not "just" a card game. 8 plays in we are starting to see some tactics/strategies emerge and the differences among corps and runners. Still haven't gotten to deck building, and haven't even seen all of the IDs yet. Plan on starting that after ~30 plays.

60+ plays: I have deckbuilt from the Corp side for over 40 plays now. The game is very, very good. Different factions allow for different main strategies and IDs help mix it up within factions. It kind of sucks having to buy packs to keep things semi-fresh, especially when it's a weaker pack but the pool of cards is overall very good.

100+ plays: We have now switched sides after playing about 80 exclusive to one side. The runner is very interesting. Where the Corp is about building a puzzle, the Runner has to have a more well-rounded kit to deal with anything.

200+ plays: We started playing as part of a local group, around 8-10 players. Being part of a meta was very fun for me and I liked how competitive things were. I was very into ANR for several months and had a respectable win rate.

Now: The group slowly splintered off as people burnt out until only 3-4 people actively played. I went away on vacation, causing me to miss a few weeks, and when I came back basically everybody had just stopped playing. After not playing for about 2 months, I strangely fell completely out of it and found myself back into "regular" board games.

Bottom line: This is still one of the best games I've ever played and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a dueling deck-builder. The catch is you must have a decent group to play with, including some people who are into it at least as much as you are. I played from 11/2013-7/2015.

Have never gone beyond having just the base set. Not able to play much as players I know tend to be quite serious and collect all the expansions - so wouldn't get much of a game from me. Have though about selling them - but you never know I might find a willing opponent. At the moment I don't feel inclined to invest time in learning the game and it's strategies well for the limited pay-off with no regular chances to play. It's also a symptom of owning so many games now that there's always something more appropriate to play.

An exceptional game that was lost in the tides of time, re-found, and re-invigorated. Love it, and I highly enjoy playing with people of the same skill. A lot like chess, this game is truly the most enjoyable with players of a similar skill level, as higher level players will easily crush new players, and inexperienced ones will have no idea of the best course of action to take. Start with someone new and learn together! It's my favorite way. The only qualm I can have is that having a lesser card pool means there are many things which can become difficult to combat, as the player with less cards won't have all of the necessary ways of defending themselves.

Was craving Magic the Gathering, but didn't want to commit to that kind of cardboard crack.  NetRunner gives exactly that.  While I haven't really gone on to get any of the expansions (i'm not sure will or won't), the base set provides enough of a stand-alone game to warrant recommending it to any CCG fan who wants something fun for less commitment.  the A-symmetrical tower-defense gameplay is pretty unique.  
If there is one *problem* with the game, it would be it's apparent inaccessibility due mainly to the fact that it is littered with techno-jargon and theme that sitting down and explaining it to a new player is difficult and tedious.  It's not a complicated game - but the fact that both players are playing VERY differently, combined with the terminology that differs, not only from other games, but with your opponents terminology [for some very similar mechanics (a draw deck is both the "Stack" and R&D" depending on which side youre playing)] makes this game a little difficult to peek peoples' interest in.
But it has a great theme, fun gameplay, and a good amount of variability in commitment (the LCG format is fantastic) - something that is lacking for most similar CCGs

Hands down the greatest asymmetrical game ever conceived.  Just brilliant; Garfield says this is his best design and he's right.  The cards are gorgeous, evocative, and often hilarious: the ICE "Archer" makes reference to a "danger zone" in its flavor text, and the card "Bad Times" has the ISBN for the book "The Andromeda Strain" buried in its flavor text.

Excellent game! I was dubious as I'm much more into the fantasy genre but after playing Netrunner with a friend I had to pick it up for myself.

Really interesting, unique game play with lots of strategy, lots of fun, great artwork, great tokens, great value.

It plays very well straight out of the box and you've essentially got 7 different decks to play with. The starter decks are a little imbalanced though and some of the cards are rather bad, so a few expansion packs do add a lot by allowing you to weed out your least favourite cards.

Takes a bit to get the hang of at the beginning, but after the first 2-3 games everything goes smoothly. 

The plus side is that not only both sides play a bit differently (corp and the runners), but so do different characters. I bet it is even better, when the decks are mixed and constructed on ones own, as I have just tried the default set-up for now.

Fascinating. Never felt attracted to Magic so it was only through this design that I learned to appreciate Garfield. What a way to use cards! Basic game works just fine – we started making custom decks only after more than 50 plays, than reverted back to pre-made ones and the play was equally good. Pity it is a LCG so without further investment it is hard to find players apart from spouse and newcomers. Fast, unpredictable, yet strategic. The theme also attracts me so I've even read some of the novels although they are lousy SF and more like crime dramas. 
Brilliant game - fast, asymmetric, rewarding, bluffing rich, a bit economic, highly interactive...

Great mix between Dominion and MTG. Does away with the random booster pack collecting of MTG, and utilizes the strength of the "fixed set" card packs from Dominion.

All in all I love the cyberpunk theme and really look forward to playing this more.

I like the game. I really do. I just don't like the genre. LCGs and CCGs all suffer from the same problem for me, and that is that much of the game takes place when you're not actually playing - the deck customization is so important if you're going to be competitive with other fans.

I don't mind deck customization - I find it interesting. It is, however, time consuming, and if I was going to sit down and play this game out of the box with someone that didn't know the rules, it would be hours before we actually got moving with custom decks, which is really where the game shines.

The mechanics themselves are excellent. Netrunner is a very good asymmetric duel between Corp and Runner, and the cards can let you pursue a number of different strategies, depending on how you tweak your deck.

slow, boring, and expensive. I would normally give this game a two as it is technically a game, but the fanboys dictate that i must vote this a 1. 
Get your niche trash out of the top 20 already.

Great cardgame if you like bluffing, tricks, mindgames and player psychology. 

Original artwork and fantastic theme.

Great mechanics , best mechanisms of a collectible card game. There is nothing that resembles it. 

Unlike Mtg you'll need to think about the cards in your hand and how to play them. You'll also need to read your opponent to succeed. 

Asymetrical play : both sides need a different way of thinking when playing. 

Hours of fun with metathinking, deckbuilding and analysing cards and tactics (if you are into that)

Best LCG hands down

On difficulty: it didn't take me long to learn. A few mistakes in the beginning as the mechanisms are pretty stand alone or play different from other ccg's. There is different terminology for all gameconcepts, yet I didn't find it particularly hard to learn that little bit vocabulary. 

On perceived luck: luck does play a role, however a good player and well constructed deck mitigates the luck , an unlikely draw can always happen such is the nature of cardgames. 
Every game I played teached me something, the game teaches you to become a better player over time, to avoid the pitfalls that happened before. 

"ANR implies a lot of different sets of skills like long term strategy, short term tactics, likelihood management, resource management, deduction, bluffing, hand management, deck management, waiting-for-the-right-moment, press your luck..." quoted ionas.

This game used to be great around the time of the first and second cycles. Today, there's too much bloat and decks are so tight I can't even imagine how boring it is to build decks to play competitively, with so much recusrion and mandatory must haves.

I miss the excitment of matches where you didn't know what you were up against and every game and you'd stand on the edge of your chair pulling your hair. I wonder if it's still possible to bring that back.

I love the asymmetrical game play. Though not the most intuitive game play, it is beautiful, thematic, and has quite a lot of strategic depth.

I like Android: Netrunner, but it require *infrastructure* to play. If you have a dedicated group to play, if you can take advantage of the deck construction aspects; add 2 points to the rating. Without that: really not worthwhile.

Pros:

*Great cyberpunk theme that's fleshed out in everything from the cards themselves to the how the game is played.

*Amazing Asymmetrical gameplay providing a different experience depending on what side you play on.

*Deep strategy with an element of bluffing.

Cons:

*Great cyberpunk theme taken to the extreme. This includes different, and many times non-intuitive names. For example if you're playing the Runner your hand is called the "Grip," but if you're playing the corporation your hand is "HQ." This makes the game difficult to learn because you have to memorize new terms for everything.

*The core set includes only 2 of some cards and 1 of others where you can meaning if you want the maximum number of all cards you need to buy 3 core sets.

RATING: 8.25
As much as I may rate Android: Netrunner highly, I fear that any game with an evolving meta, shaped by an ever-increasing pool of cards, makes it impossible to keep up with and ultimately just play casually, especially in my case. It really becomes a lifestyle, requiring long-term dedication to that of eSports. And while LCGs may mitigate the FoMO-induced collectability aspect found in CCGs, it still ends up being a money sink in the long run.

That being said as for the game itself, it may well be my favourite TCG. The theme, the depth and the asymmetry, makes it very unique. As with other games in this genre the learning curve is extremely high, not to mention understanding action timing.

Only recommended if you either have enough time to dedicate yourself to the meta or don't care about it at all - definitely not suited for inbetweeners.

I was very intrigued when I heard this was coming back into print. I had never played the original but it had always interested me. Having played it now, I can understand folks' fascination. The game indeed is excellent and varied. I have read up on the differences between this version of the game and the original Netrunner, and it sounds like all the changes were for the better. If nothing else, I'm just happy to be able to acquire and enjoy this game again.

Likes: Two player, heads-up.  A huge head game for both players.  The LCG format allows me to buy what I want when I want it.

Dislikes: Pretty hard to teach. There's a lot of reaction from friends regarding 'systems' and buying into them.

Erst 1 x gespielt. Auf englisch schwierig wegen der komplexen Regeln und weil jede Karte etwas anderes macht. Man muss sehr viel lesen, verschiedene Bezeichnungen lernen und irgendwie kamen wir nicht richtig rein. Keine Bewertung, weil ich das Gefühl habe, dass das Spiel nach einer Runde und auf englisch noch nicht fair bewertbar ist.

The game that has taken up the most thought-time in my mind-brain and it is spectacular. Nothing will match building something almost as large as the magic scene in the small town I was living in around this game when it was new. I find it hard to keep up with the meta given my current lifestyle, and can't really afford to own all the cards, but gosh this is my favorite game design. :')

3 copies of the Core Set owned.

A fantastic remake of the original (which I used to enjoy thoroughly).

I'm glad they finally went with better distribution of single and dual copies and that you can now have excellent decks with only 2 sets (one is still a bit iffy in my opinion, but also not that bad).

2 személyes deckbuilder. Nagyon fordulatossá és izgalmassá teszi, hogy a szemben álló felek teljesen másképpen kell játsszák. Itt is igaz, ha nem ismered a kártyákat, de az ellenfeled igen, akkor nem nyerhetsz.

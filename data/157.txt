RANK: 1030

RATING: 6
Not to everyone's tastes - little player interaction, potentially lots of downtime and analysis paralysis, with some heavy swings of luck. And it's got crayons. But it is surprisingly engaging and it's easy to get engrossed in a very well themed game. Can be very enjoyable with the right group / mood.

One of the best games I own. It requires
a moderate amount of planning (couple of
moves), but also the flexibility to change
plans when drawing different cards.

RATING: 6.5
   Eurorails feels (my opinion) good in the way the contracts and their values are distributed (I will mention when I play, I remove contract number #22, that contract's value being weirdly different, highest value of the three being at $9). By distributed well, I mean the value of the contracts is well balanced (again, it is my opinion that they seem that way), the 3 possibilities being spread apart on the map and having 3 different values, each contract having a payoff in the 10-15, 15-25, 25-35 range (there are 60's in there for Spain-related contracts, of course).
   I will say however, that I have never (nor seen anyone else I have played with) bothered with ANY of the Scandinavian cities. No goods there are THAT rare, unlike Spain, which not only has high value deliveries but also more-rare goods to pick up(specifically Cork and Fruit), making the trips there more valuable.

I love this game. In an alternate universe, I would rate this a 9.

The fact that I like it more than anyone in my usual playing group drags it down.  It is too long, too un-interactive, too fiddly, and too boring for my friends and family.  For me, I will happily fiddle away with cards and crayons for the chance to build a rail empire. I have a soft-spot for any game that lets me construct something, so the expanding rail system offers incremental rewards from start to finish.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Three reasons I didn't like this:

1. The event cards just randomly punish people. 
2. The victory conditions are wildly unbalanced (the connection condition is much easier to achieve than the money condition). I may be wrong about this, but given point 3 below I don't have the desire to find out.  
3. The game is just slow.  Often your turn is just moving your train 9 or 12 spaces (when you're on a long route). Other times your turn grinds to a halt because you can't plan on other people's turns because you need to wait until you get your new cards to decide what to do next. 

I would much rather play Steam or Power Grid or First Train to Nuremberg or Baltimore and Ohio or even Ticket to Ride.

I like this one a lot since the cities are more spread out.  Basically you decided if you need to go to Spain or Italy since you need all but one of the Major cities.  However, you will miss out on certain delivery if you skip either one. This is the original big box 1993 version.

This rail game seems to lack the balance of the others in Mayfair&#039;s system. I&#039;ve spent many a game ditching my hand just to get one load I could carry.  Maybe the map is too spread out or the payoffs are not in step with what it takes to build in Europe?  I&#039;d say stick with Empire Builder or Iron Dragon.

I enjoy all of the crayon rails.  I have heard that there is not a "best route" for EuroRails since the board is big.  Also, I like the idea of making a major city in Scandanavia and requiring connection to all but one major city.  Use the public locking rules -- they make the game more strategic.

We really enjoy these crayon rail games. We play with quite a few house rules. It's really enjoyable to watch the rail lines grow. There's quite a bit of solitaire action, but when someone does take that final resource, it bites you hard. I enjoy this with two and three players. More than that, though I haven't played with, seems like it would take to long. Highly recommended.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A very approachable theme that non-gamers can relate to. It's a very simple pick-up and deliver game. 

The quintessential example of multi-player solitaire that has zero inter-personal interaction. Overly long and prone to mind-numbing AP while each independent player hunts for symbols all over the game board. I understand its potential broad appeal but it's certainly not for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

In all significant regards the Winsome Trainsport games do it better.  There really is very little reason to play these.

Update: I used to rate this a 3, however I've taken to playing the Empire Builder series with my kids.  They're a fine way to introduce concepts of geography, transport dynamics, ROI, budgeting etc while practicing basic arithmetic in a family setting.  They also provide a perfectly pleasant almost dreamy period of just hanging out and almost doing nothing that has more than a little family value.  I appreciate that.  I still don't think much of them as games, they're more shared activities than games, but I'm actually in the strange position of regularly advocating their play now!

I bought this when a friend convinced me that this was a great game. I think that it is too long for what it is, he still thinks it is great.
Update, comment from a playing of Iron Dragon

	
I don't understand the appeal of any of the crayon rail games, on turn 2 someone was eliminated because a bridge was washed out in front of him and you are not allowed to turn around and he had no money to rebuild (it was only the second turn) and so that was it, he was out. The end game was sort fun, but the 4 hrs it took to get there was worse than getting teeth pulled, I will NEVER play one of these games again!

Excellent crayon rail game.  Can't wait to try again.  This is the best pick up and deliver that I've played unless you include Roads and Boats (but that's a different animal mostly).  The ruleset for Eurorails is small and intuitive.  1.5 - 2 hours per player is probably what you're looking at after a couple of plays.  Nothing too crazy.
This might end up a "10" after more plays.

Garage sale game, paid $8.  It's a sequel to Empire Builder, with a European map board.  Unique in that you use crayons to draw your rail lines on the board.  This was my best garage sale find that year.  I bought it at the Saskatoon Exhibition area community garage sale.  I love the game.  People unfamiliar with the location of European cities are at a disadvantage.

The main reason to play this or any other game in this series is because you get to draw on the board.  Otherwise, it's a pretty straightforward economic race game.

This is "Empire Builder Goes To Europe."  It's strong on logistics, rewarding players who are good at figuring out the most efficient way of making money.  Sometimes the short run-and-delivery is worth more than that big expensive load of oranges that you have to drag clear across Europe in order to deliver.  Game length of this game, however, is pretty discouraging to the folks I usually game with, so I don't get to play this nearly as often as I'd like.

This game does have some things going for it.  But it also has some significant downsides.

On one hand, I like the basic concept - a combination of route building and economic engine building.  I also really enjoy figuring out how to make my hand of cards into a profitable run.  So the game does hold a lot of interest to me.  However, there are at least four things wrong with it, which are bad enough to make me quite hesitant about playing again.

1) Too much downtime!  This might be a particular problem with the people I have played with, but it can seem a long time before it gets around to your turn.  Worse yet, most of your turns you don't actually make any meaningful decisions - just move your train along.  So the wait before you get to actually do something interesting again can seem interminable.

2) Very little player interaction.

3) There's a lot of luck in those cards.  Granted, there is skill in the game, too, but particularly for a game this long there is really an unacceptable amount of luck. 

4) Calculating the exact route to take (once you know which cities you want to hit) is a bit tedious.  I don't strongly dislike it, but neither is it really very interesting for me, and it makes a bad combination with #1 (waiting for other players to calculate), and also #3 (why think so hard when the luck of the cards is more important anyways?)

A very enjoyable, albeit lengthy game. Tends to go on a bit even with quick start rules. Highly malleable, making house rules easy to tack on. Arguably, half the game is spent building your rail line, and the other half running the train. With smart play, then end game can be quite close. Using the quick start rules, two player games can be over in 120 minutes. With four players, the games can easily run 180 minutes.

I haven't played it in a while, but I loved this game growing up. I received it for Christmas when I was about 10.  I think that the Alps (and other large mountains) and ferries add a lot to the game. Interestingly, some games they increase player interaction and other games they can decrease player interaction.

Clearly, in my opinion the best of the crayon rail games. Interesting destinations and loads. Remote corners of the board and ferries make for some interesting connections. Have trouble getting family to play since they do not know all the city locations.

the rules are very well laid out and highly understandable even though they may seem daunting.
The only thing that lets the game down is the crayons which do not mark very well.  Other than that it's a nice game.

One of my favourite games. Quite apart from my own enjoyment, it's simple enough to let lots of people join in who might be put off by more rules-heavy or more complicated games.

This is by far the game that my wife and I enjoy playing the most. The two of us can play through this two or three times in a weekend if we really set our mind to doing it.
It just has a nice complexity that requires planning several moves ahead. Chance has some bearing only in that you never know what "loads" are coming to come up when you draw.
There are few cases where taking a gamble can pay off really big or make for a long struggle to come out on top.
Any way it goes it turns out to be a fun game just because it's generally not until the very end, or close to it, that you really know who's going to win.
The only complaint I have with the game is that if you play with inexperienced players, the time to play can absolutely baloon as they try to grapple with the mechanics of planning their moves.

RATING: 7
A more convoluted version of Empire Builder, with ferries, alpines, ocean inlets, and generally more challenging terrain in which to build an railroad empire. The system holds up well, as it has with the other incarnations, and it is possible to keep this to around 4 hrs with four people with the "fast trains" rules. At this point, it is personal preference of which one of the series people like. Rating: "8".

Update (01/01/12) 4 plays: With 3 experienced players, using "fast train" rules, it is possible to keep this to 2 hours. Crayon rail games can be mindless, relaxing fun, due to the relatively limited interaction, and can be a great way to decompress after a night of heavy gaming.

Update (01/10/14) 8 plays: Note to self: Do not use this as an introduction to crayon rails! Three new terrain types, challenging map, and smaller payoffs for contracts makes this a much more difficult system to swallow with one sitting--stick with Empire Builder.

Update (06/04/2015) 9 plays: Smaller payoffs make for a longer, draggier, frustrating game. Stronger preference for Iron Dragon. Down a notch to a "7".

It's like India Rails... in Europe.  I'm starting to pick up on the strategy; a lot of it is in choosing the right starting location.  There is a high luck factor in the cards and the game is quite long, but the first is acceptable to me and the second is actually desirable for the contexts in which I play it.  It's more a feeling of peacefully constructing infrastructure rather than fiercely competing over resources, but there are times I like that. (3 plays)

I tend to love most crayon games, and each of the Empire Builder games have had just enough differences that I'd buy a couple for variety.  Pick up and deliver where you need to build your rail line and fulfil contracts.  Can be a little repetitive running cargo, and a little cut throat getting into a city to cut off a rival's access.  No where near as mean as Age of Steam.

I really like this game.  Will play but it takes a while to finish.  Took us 5 hours to complete the first game by the rules, and seven by the way we played (through the cards once).

My favorite of the crayon games, but like all of this type, play with quick thinkers and builders, otherwise this will BORE you to tears. I hate the idea of dragging along an extra high-cost commodity and then hoping to get lucky with it. Most games among equal players come down to this. Bad design. That said, the game is kind of neat, and it&#039;s cool jockeying for position. This needed more incentive to build into Scandanavia.

Rated after a single 2-player game with my wife. I prefer the smaller maps (India and British) when playing with 2, but I did enjoy this map more than the Empire Builder map.  This is my favorite of the larger maps when we have the time for the extended game.  We played with the Fast Rules, so we didn't have to connect the cities.

Still an interesting game... and it makes you learn (or relearn) the geography of Europe :)

A crayon-rails game centered in Europe. The idea is quite simple, build rails to connect cities, and move your train on those rails to deliver goods. The game slows down when players are calculating the most efficient way to build their track. Its okay to play once in a while, but for such a simple repetitive game, its probably an hour or two longer than it needs to be.

RATING: 8
Load cards and engines are improved.
Updated board-- more joints makes things harder to erase and I expect de-lamination issues later on. Otherwise not bad.
Load tokens are hard to read and the ink has bled on some. Don't like them.
Movement tokens ("trains") are odd round thing with points. Cheap, and not an improvement over what was a weak component in the last game.
Money is very thick. Annoying. Hopefully some use will stop them from sticking together.
The crayons don't work. They are too light, and they don't mark well. They are crap. I'm most disappointed in those.

The chunnel and reduced ferry prices, plus the two new "incentive" load cards are an improvement, as are the re-jigged trade routes on the cards (more focus on Scandanavia and on different types of loads, less "Cork to Cork").

Overall, I'd prefer to get better crayons then keep these load cards and keep the old board.

When I need a gateway game, this is usually what I reach for.  And when I need a nice three or four player game for experienced gamers, we might reach for this as well.  There's a lot of re-playability, and its a ton of fun (who doesn't like to draw on a map with crayons).  Sure, it can be multi-player solitaire, but the geography has lots of bottlenecks, and there are certain routes everyone competes for (like getting into Holland cheap).  If you play with too many new people at once it can drag, but with experienced players, people can move/build simultaneously and things move right along.

The game is an effort in creatign efficiency and can be very enjoyable for certain types of players, but in the end it almost seems like you could play this game by yourself, acting as all four players, and I woudl think the result would be very similar

As a member of the Empire Builder family, Eurorails is a charmingly uncomplicated track-builder. Most of the tension comes from the first few rounds, where careless planning or overspending could screw-up the rest of your game. After building a few connections the game gets to speed and runs fast(er) with 2 or 3 players. It feels very similar to Railroad Tycoon/Railways of the World, but much dryer.

An excellent design, but it can take a little long (not necessarily a deterrent for me).

Update: I'm not so sure the design is that excellent. It gets a little boring after the first play which isn't a good sign.

This is a pretty boring game. It takes too long for what it is. I do, however, look forward to teaching this to my son when he gets to be 6 or so. I'd probably enjoy it then.

Mmm... I like a lot of the decisions that need to be taken in the game, the optimization process that goes on to maximize your money/turn generated, but the game takes quite a bit of time to complete, the offer/demand system is quite random, and the game gets quite repetitive after 10-12 turns. Once your network is built, all you have to do is pick up stuff and deliver it, and hope that you can do it faster than the other guys. Where you can go/how much money you make is dictated by the awefully random order cards, so the end game felt quite unsatisfying. Would be willing to play again to see what I may have missed.

RATING: 9
My second favorite now after Martian has taken over first place.  This is a solid 9 for me but only if (and these are all official variants I would suggest to anyone wanting a faster game):

*play with only 2 or 3 players
*70 million to start
*3 Pre game building phases played in switchback
*5 demand cards to start, keep 3
*The two train speeds are 12/16, not 9/12
*tax card is removed
*Optional but good: loans are not allowed

Other good variants to consider:
Open Contracts
Warehousing
200M to win

I like the crayon rails series, but I love them when they play a little bit faster.

There's nothing wrong with this 20-year old classic. An excellent one for whiling away the long winter afternoons, it's intuitive, easily-taught and an excellent exercise in economy, especially if you play without bank loans. It would be nice if it were about half an hour shorter, mind you, and the components are nothing to shout about. I'd gladly have paid £20 extra for decent counters, a map that looks prettier and won't fray, and some viable alternative to wax crayons.

All the Rails games are solid.  They're not flashy and you don't kill anything so it tends to get passed up for other games; but after playing Euro Rails for the first time, most people say "Wow, a game where you deliver pigs sounded stupid but it was pretty fun."
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
"Another solid crayon rails game, and fun solo (win in as few turns as possible). As with the other full-size games in the series, I won't play with more than 2p, because it just takes too long with too many (and/or new) players."

What I like:
- Fun logistical puzzle
- Low confrontation (if played with certain rules and player counts)

What I don't like:
- My first game (2p) was exactly 3 hours; 2nd with the same 2p was 130 minutes
- I would be happier with fewer mileposts on the board

I am indifferent on the train theme, but I do enjoy most pickup-and-deliver games. I enjoy the route building, running the train, managing money, and the way the contracts work. 

It just moves slow, at least when you don't really know the game: Allow 90 minutes per newbie, although I know that experts can finish in 30-45 minutes per player.

I can imagine that a 3p or 4p game could be much too crowded for me (not to mention even longer). I like it 2p with loose rules about connecting into cities.

I would put the weight around 2.7, agreeing with the BGG voters. The rules are probably about 2.5, but the open-ended nature of it, along with the depth that follows, increases the overall weight.

Eurorails has very little conflict as you ride your rails trying to get upgrades to your train and gathering goods for big payouts. There is a slight learning curve as you try to determine the best way to draw out your rails cheaply and deliver your good efficiently. I believe the game would be suitable for couples if you like this sort of game.

Despite its length, this game is very easy to learn and comprehend.  While the game's lack of complexity may be inadequate when you're looking for a real brain-burner, generally I find this game to be a nice, relaxing activity.

Eurorails is really my favorite crayon rails map.  The varied geography with large bodies of water everywhere really makes things interesting for me.

Found at Value Village Thrift on 11/28/2007 for $2.98. Complete 1990 edition. One split corner, but the cards were still in shrink.

This game is horrible to play if anyone at the table has a case of AP. The game is quite long, and can allow for quite a bit of downtime. Decent enough components, and the game sets up, and tears down quickly, so that is a plus. Seems to be the most fun at the beginning, when you are planning out your strategy. The second half of the game is nothing more than a race however, so it loses a few points from me for that.

This was my first Eurogame after Settler's of Catan. Thus it still holds a special place for me. I've played many games with my wife and she loves it too. Have had great success teaching to non gamer friends. Needs a hefty time investment though (4-5 hours with 4 players) You can speed it up by drawing a communal route with a neutral colour and by playing with 2 trains.

We play with the public locking rules. (If you’re playing this variant, don’t combine this with the variant in which players operate more than one train!) Simple and gratifying, but way too long! It’s also very irritating to constantly to look all over the board for cities that produce a specific good. (The public locking rules help alleviate this since you can help each other find cities on the map.) If the density of the mileposts were smaller, perhaps this would be a quicker and less exhausting game.

My favourite game.  It helped me fall in love with board games.  I love the way you build your network and how you can see it develop throughout the game.  I also love the way you manage your routes to try to get as much money as you can.  It feels like I am actually trekking across all those European countries, and when I make the long trips up to Britain, or Scandinavia, etc. it feel s like I really am going a long distance.

Great pick-up and deliver game with some tight economics and fun network building.  I like how you can pay others to use their track -  I wish the cost were perhaps a bit lower relative to building track to incentivize it more, as that can offer more player interaction of choosing to use track of players lagging income wise.  Events can feel a bit random, although they help prevent you from taking the game too seriously.  There can be a lot of downtime when you're just waiting to move your train 9 or 12 spaces.  I feel like if the rules required that you stop your movement and end your turn to drop-off goods, then you would haven't to wait for players to receive a new delivery card and decide mid-turn where they're going to go next.  If I were to redesign it, I would break the turns into phase rounds: 1. everyone moves, picking up any goods they want; 2. everyone drops off goods and gets new delivery cards, if applicable; 3. in turn, each player can buy track and upgrades, with start player rotating each round; 4. activate event, and reveal new event that will activate at the end of next turn.  I have played Empire Builder but don't remember how similar it is - I'm interested in exploring the many other versions to see how they modify the system.

This is another of the Empire Builder series that I like a lot.  Some say this is the best of the real world maps, but I'm not sure I agree.  The load cards and rules try to send you to all areas of the board.  However, it seems that you are more successful if you resist this pressure and only journey to the far reaches when absolutely necessary.  Still, it's a nice big map and a good change of pace from the original.  [9]
------------------------------------------
I've had an interesting relationship with this game over the years.  Apparently, at some point int the distant past, I thought of this as a nine.  It's been a very long time since I've thought that highly of it.  Still, I think it rates an 8, if for no other reason than the large map.  Even so, it would be at the bottom of my list of eights and is in danger of losing a spot to Australian Rails as well.

My biggest issue, which I seem to be in the minority on, is that the game really does not seem to reward efficient railbuilding as much as some of the others do.  In fact, it seems to really reward pursuit of the big payouts.  There's nothing particularly wrong with that objectively I suppose.  I just prefer that it were not that way.  I also don't buy into this belief that this game is somehow more balanced loadwise, delivery-wise, or whatever than the other games in the series, particularly Empire Builder.  Well, everyone is welcome to their own opinion, I suppose.

Another problem is related to the large map, and particularly in the two player games I play most.  There are significant areas of the board that are ignored.  Even in a game with several players, there are generally several areas that no one visits unless they want to lose.  

And the biggest problem of all is that there is no Finland.  For shame. [05/24/2009]

I like the pick-up and deliver. It's more of a race game than an interactive one. It's also a bit longer than it probably should be, but I still enjoy it.

Great geography tool for teaching kids. As all the crayon games go, it just kind of depends on what scenario you want to play. My favorite of these is Iron Dragon with it's fantasy theme, different races and other unique rules. However, I always like mixing it up from time to time, as they all have their own charm.

Classic Crayon Rail game.  This along with Empire Builder are the definitive 'pick up and deliever' games.  

it is fun trying to maximize your route while trying to collect cash for deliveries.  The 'luck' factor can play hugely in what demand cards you get; but for the most part, the player with the most efficient track can make the fastest most lucrative deliveries.  

Is a little long for what it is; but it is an enjoyable train game.

I played the various crayon rail games when I returned to boardgaming back in 2000.  As I continued to play them, I found myself less interested in playing them.  Is it multiplayer solitaire ... perhaps.  They are okay games, just not great.  I would rather play something else.

A very durable addition to the Mayfair rails collection.  This is not the one I would choose to play solitaire, but it is an excellent game for 2 or 3.

RATING: 10
Out of all the Mayfair rail games, this is my second favorite (the first would be Iron Dragon.)  The gameplay is simple and the map is wide open enough that there aren't too many bottlenecks where everyone is trying to build through the same stretch at once.  The disaster cards also hit fairly hard.  Usually in the Mayfair rail games the disasters seem to happen off on some other part of the board (unless they're floods).  In this game, the disasters seem well-balanced enough to be equally disastrous for most players.

I've only played this once and it was with two experienced players: a friend and boyfriend (now hubby).   Hubby owns this and Iron Dragon.

It is so loooooong.  I didn't know what I was doing.  They did.  It was tedious to the nth degree.. 

There are some games I don't like to play very much (plain Catan is one) but I will play them.  Not this.  I told my hubby "no more of those damn crayon games!"  So he and his friend will plan a special night to play these crayon games together.

Ugh.  I'm sure if I played it more, studied more, I would maybe enjoy it.  But there are so many other games I don't play enough, so I'm not wasting any more time on these games.

The first crayon rail game I have played, and I love it.  Some complain that it takes too long.  What we do is circle the spot our train is at, pack it, then bring it out next time we have some time.  I've found that its great fun to spread your railroad empire building out over several days!

RATING: 6.9
This game was my second foray into Crayon Rail games. I had recently played British Rails for the first time. I don't really feel like these are two separate games so much as variant maps for the same game a la Powergrid.

So my first comment will be how this differs from the other Crayon Rail game I played, which is primarily in geography. There's also ferrys in this version, which force you to end your turn and then cause you to move at half rate your following turn. In general they seem like bad things to tangle with very often.

The rest of my comments are going to be more about Crayon Games in general. There's three main issues I have with CR games, ranging from minor and medium to serious.

My minor complaint is that there's a lot of information to front load. You need to learn (if you don't already know) the geography, and then learn which items are rare and where everything is produced. This is helped by cheat sheets but it's still a lot for a first play. Over multiple plays this would become much less of a problem.

My mid-level complaint is that the turn structure is a bit wonky. There are rounds where it takes 60 seconds for everyone to take their turns as everyone is running their train and building nothing. But then there are turns where it might take minutes to get back to you as people have to recalculate based on new cards and build new track. This leads to some downtime issues. The game is probably best at two or three players for this reason.

My serious complaint is about randomness. There's two main issues here. Foremost is the events. Events can just randomly crap on people. In this particular play for example the winner never lost a turn to events, while another player lost at least two turns, and had several turns that were less than optimal due to events. I had an event that cost me about 1/4th of my final score. But the randomness of events is easily remedied... just play without them.

The more intractable random issue is the delivery cards. When you deliver a good, you draw a random replacement delivery card. Sometimes that delivery doesn't work at all. It requires you to go all over the board to places you don't already go. And it might not even pay that well. Other times it requires a pickup and delivery that you've already built to and can easily accomplish. Or it might synergize with other card in your hand allowing you to pick up a single good and deliver it to multiple locations that are convenient for you. Or, best of all, it requires you to deliver a good that you already have on your train (and if you've carried a rare good from far away that can be mega-bucks).

These random cards can really impact the game. If two players are close, the one who gets the better delivery card has a real leg up. This can be mitigated by taking a turn to flush your hand, but already there's a penalty as you've wasted a turn... and you might not get any better cards.

It just seems as though the skill elements of the game (route-building and pick-up/delivery planning) can be swamped by this random element of the game. And it's a fairly long deep game to have the outcome be potentially decided by a swing of random luck.

The crayon railroad games were fun for a while but I have grown tired of them. The problem in my opinion is there is so little interaction between the players. It is like everyone is playing a solitare game and there just happens to be other players on the board. They also seem to run pretty long. If I'm going to invest this much time I would rather play Rail Baron.

I love the idea and the mechanics behind the crayon rails system.  Unfortunately, the game is far too long with the written rules for it to get played more than very occasionally.  Faster house-rule trains (and fewer players) might help.

ED: Last couple of times I played this, we set the train speeds at 12 and 16 rather than 9 and 12.  It's a huge improvement.

'Multi-player solitaire' describes this well.  It's an interesting exercise, trying to maximize efficiency and balancing extending the network (long-term gains) vs. making short-term cash.  Also, knowing when to stop building and just stockpile cash seems to be a question of timing that's not totally obvious - should I build to do a delivery on one of my present cards, or should I skip my turn and hope to get new cards that allow me to stay within my existant network.  Still, the lack of player interaction really hurts this game.

Crayon games were the bees knees back in the flapper era (at least, I think they're that old) before dice and television were invented.

They're still pleasant enough in the 21st century when run in 2-player mode. With more than two, the downtime makes you want to seek out an axe and prune down the player count until it IS a 2-player game.

And yes, you will curse the ferries for dragging out a game that is already unnecessarily long.

I love the concept of these crayon rail line routing games. It's a very cool to mix the childlike tactile fun of crayons with the high strategy of railroad routing and trade dominance. 

This game takes FOREVER to play though. I've only played once and that game took about 14 hours to complete. The 12 player AdCiv game in the next room finished before we did.

I've been playing this game during lunch at work. It's easy enough to put away and set back up for the next session to continue. I was one of three people and all of us enjoyed it very much. After a while, we started playing with variations and eventually introduced a crude supply and demand economics that made it much more challenging.

My go-to drinking game.  Best drawing game I've found.

RATING: 2
This version of Telestrations doesn't really work.  The phrases and words are vastly harder to illustrate and it seems like most of the artwork would devolve to just drawing genitalia.  I like genitalia jokes as much as the next idiot, but this just doesn't work as a party game.  The original Telestrations is far superior.

The idea for Telestrations is great. But the cards... We used to find out our own passwords, as even people working with English had troubles to get all meanings of passwords from cards. (Also I heard that the marker goes out quickly.)

the "after dark" component isn't needed. it's pretty easy to go "dark" with the regular game.
also easy to play this game with paper, but the dry erase pads make everything much smoother.

Always gets people laughing which is why I love it so much. The cards that come with it are pretty weak so I recommend players make up their own subjects.

Telestrations meets Cards Against Humanity!  Probably more funny is how "clean" clues go south quickly and "dirty" ones tend to become more innocent when drawn.  Not sure if I like the removal of the timer as it seems this can back things up quite a bit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is really just a filler game.  It's silly and gets the group going ok but it's one of those games where it doesn't really have a clear end or anything really too it.  You play this to get some giggles going but that's it's only real value.

It's dirty Telestrations. This game along with the regular version is a MUST party game. So many laughs! The makers are too thick to draw well in this version.

Gets old a lot faster than regular Telestrations. Many of the words/phrases are impossible to draw, or impossible to distinguish. And there are only so many times you can draw genitalia and giggle.

Same as the original with very slightly dirtier content. Most of the cards could be in the original version.

Surprisingly fun for being Telestrations with an adult theme.  Unlike CAH, there is still creativity in the drawings which keeps the spirit of Telestrations.  The game is also setup with phrases instead of a single word which has always made the game shine better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The most laughter, the hardest laughs I've ever seen from a boardgame. The best party game out there, until proven otherwise.

Update: Like many/most games, novelty wears off with repeated plays. While I still think it's the best party game out there, you'll need to switch it up and come back to this game from time to time. The adult version has a tendency to reduce to the same crude images/ideas over and over again, which is a bummer.

Impromptu Game Night Pick-Up. Not bad!

EDIT:
Bumped this up a bit. This is really fun with the right group. My major complaint is how bad my face hurts from laughing so hard; it's almost TOO funny!

You guys know the cards are just there as a guide, right? And you can swap in cards from pretty much *any* party game and have it generally still work? (Codenames, Charades, Concept, Cards Against Humanity, etc*) - just give a handful to choose from. Or just come up with your own words!


* I don't know why they all start with C, either.

Drags everyone down to a low brow state of mind and minimizes the potential for creative play. I loathe "adult" versions of perfectly good games. Just play Telestrations, and insert the occasional dick joke, FOR FUCK'S SAKE!

Seems like most Telestrations games I play end up being After Dark type games anyways. Still, these cards provide the necessary suggestion in that direction straight away. Not for the kids/faint-hearted.

This is an adult version of the award winning Telestrations. Gameplay is the same, but the word content has changed to more adult fare. Some of the word cards now include stuff such as "Anaconda", "Jackhammer", "Doggie Style", and "Human Centipede".

'the after dark' is probably not really necessary to have fun, but this game make us always laugh so bad 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
The "after dark" cards feel forced. It's as though they are shoehorning them into a system that doesn't need them to be fun. I found they were much much harder to draw than the base cards as well. If you like Cards Against Humanity, then this is in the same genre (though more tame) but I think I would much rather play with the regular cards.

RATING: 8.5
I first played this winding down in the hotel after a friend's bachelor party and had to go out and buy it for myself.  Groups I've played with break out into tears laughing so hard after presenting their pad.  Yeah, it's the adult version and not the normal, but half the humor is in how awful a person can draw G-rated pictures but then that same timid friend you knew so well can produce great stick figure smut.

More like an activity than a game. You get a few laughs, but if everyone is good at drawing it does not work.

It's like Telestrations for Bad People. In other words, it's Telestrations mixed with Cards Against Humanity, which makes it even better than the base game.  It's better when you're drunk, and they even provide beer coasters because they know exactly what you are doing while playing this.   Could very well be the perfect party game.

Exactly what it sets out to be; a more adult-oriented version of Telestrations. It doesn't go so far off the deep end as something like, say, Cards Against Humanity, but there's enough of that in here if you want it. Some of the words and phrases are just plain impossible to draw though, which leads to some great games. I don't know that this breathes much new life into Telestrations as an overall experience, but it's worth it if you tend to play with a more mature crowd.

This game is solid when played with a decent group who want to be silly. If you play with folks who do not really want to be silly and want to play practical, then its not a lot of fun. I would say this game has a lot of expectation associated with it.

2.15.16 Exact same as Telestrations but just more adult. While it does open up some avenues, really it just becomes a one trick pony and can leave the accessibility of the original game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I'm usually not a fan of adult games. They tend to be crude and try to be funny at the same time and it just fails miserably. This one is a rare exception. Love this one and it always makes my belly hurt from laughter.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This one is great. To be fair, Telestrations would probably garner a similar rating. The fun of this version is you can go as dirty as you want to, but also as conservative as you want to as well. Different groups will scale either way, and the cards give you a level of obscenity that varies. I don't get the big groups that this game wants.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game made us laugh harder than possibly any other we've ever played.  After playing it a few times, I came to realize I still like the original game more.  This game really limits who you can play with, such as many family members or friends who could be awkward when prompted to draw or guess certain things..  It is for a more niche audience.  It's an awesome party game, and it even comes with coasters.

I enjoy a good game of Telestraions and this one is slightly better than the original since it comes with word card prompts that you'd actually want to use!

This is Telestrations with "adult" themed clues.  I put adult in quotes because while some of them are certainly adult such as "doggy style" or "human centipede", others are just very normal words.  I like having adult R-rated fun and already have a ton of family-friendly party games so for me this is strictly better than vanilla Telestrations.  I just wish they were a little more bold with the selection of clues.

Things going off the rails into risque areas is the point of Telestrations. Why would you want to start there? There's no inadvertent dirtying of innocence in this version.

RATING: 4
Pretty disappointed by the cards. Expected a little more "dirty" to what was being drawn. I think people looking for an adult version of Telestrations are better off buying the regular game and mashing it up with Cards Against Humanity.

{1 play • 4 players} We had a blast with this one.  I'd heard it was all memory, and in theory, if you can play that way then, yeah, you'll probably win in a cake walk.  But in practice, we were all just trying to remember a few specific spots... and dang if we just kept messing up, causing much laughter all around.  I know part of my enjoyment of this one was us being in the right mood, and also the gorgeously produced board and bits, so I suspect my rating will drop with subsequent plays... but maybe not that far.  There is one problem, though: it seems like you're more likely to win by giving away your final vampire on someone else's bad move rather than winning the game on your turn by making a good move.  That not only feels wrong, but it encourages the far-too-serious player to vamp (pun intended) when down to his last vampire - just keeping picking the safe-but-wrong casket and wait for someone to hand you the win.  Of course, maybe there's a game end rule we got wrong, but you could just as easily prohibit players from giving away their last vampire, forcing them to win on their turn only.

Please note that this rating is based on the fact of what the game is trying to be. It is a kids game, and one with a memory aspect. It is, without a doubt, the most strategic and choice-filled game of that type I have ever played. The theme is rich and enjoyable, and the components top-notch. As a kids memory game, it is almost perfect, and certainly worthy of the title "excellent".

RATING: 6
Interesting Memory variant.  One nice aspect is the design seems fairly modular, such that it's not hard to peel off some of the rules to make it easier to understand for a larger age range.  Taking the rules for garlic out, for instance, still leaves a good Memory game, but it becomes also more accessible at the cost of some of the strategy.  Also easier to make shorter by just reducing the number of vampires that need to be placed.  At its heart, it is really just Memory, but the theme, bits, and some bells and whistles make it a much improved version.

RATING: 3
Memory games aren't really my bag...I do quite like the theme on this one, but I have such a terrible recall that playing this game with me ends up being very, very random. I think the problem is that it would take quite a bit of effort to actually keep track of what all the colours are, where the vampires are buried, and where the garlic is and that the theme and feel of the game conflicts with that in my mind...I can't take it overly seriously, and I don't care enough to engage it with a large amount of effort.

I think the game is a good enough representative of its genre...I just don't think that any game with memory skills such as this is ever going to rate highly with me.

With 60 tiles to keep track of throughout the game, Dicke Luft in der Gruft is tough and has some clever mechanisms that elevate it above the average tile flipping memory game.  Very nice production; the extra thick sarchophagus lid tiles are great and the sunken graves is a really neat effect on the board.  I'm terrible at this game, but I still like to play it.

RATING: 4
Basically a game of Concentration, in which you try to match up locations from memory, with some added rules. The construction of the board is nicely done; a double-thick board with cutouts for graves, that have separate grave lids that rest over them. Anyone can easily pick up how to play this game.

RATING: 6
Colourful memory game where players are trying to get rid of their "hand" of vampires by either finding a matching, unoccupied, crypt - or by handing them off to other players when they make an error.  There are 60 crypts, 60 vampires and after 30 seconds everything looks very much alike.  Remembering what went where is much harder than it sounds.  To add, ahem, flavour to the game, players can seed crypts with garlic to further foil their opponents.  As memory games go, this game is very good.  The components are amazing - from the double thickness game board, to the thick and chunky crypt lid tiles.  The theme may be a bit dark, but it's lightened considerably by the cute artwork - not a lot to worry about here.

I have some problems to rate this game. It is a childrens game and as I never play with children I can't rate it fairly for what it is. So perhaps I shouldn't rate it at all. But we played it with a bunch of adults and really had fun with it. It is a nice memory game with a fair amount of schadenfreude (ist this an english word?). So I will rate it as an short adult fun game and hope it is fair to the game ;)
Perhaps it is even better as a childrens game!

Memory game - nice components (29/12/10). UPDATE: Review is qualified by the fact that I got this game cheap ($10), and I need to play if a few more times, but seemingly just a memory game - still, nice solid bits - rating 6 (17/12/11). UPDATE: Actual, whilst billed as a family game, this is a fairly serious memory game with nice bits and good theme. A keeper increased by 1 to 7 (Aug 2013).  UPDATE: Actually, memory games are just not what I play these days, so gone (Rating 5.622, Jan 17)

RATING: 7
Excellent memory game.  While this moniker usually consigns people's expectations to the "been there, done that" bin, this game has more going for it.  

Sixty covered coffins adorn the board non-symmetrically.  Players find homes for their vampires (game comes with 10 of each in six colors total) in empty graves on the board covered by coffin lids.   

In order to get rid of a vampire, the vampire's color must match the coffin's lid color and the grave must be empty. Revealing an occupied coffin = gain a wooden stake = three stakes and you're given more vampires by the other players to get rid of.  

Garlic cloves may also be placed (three per player), which prevents vampire placement (and also allows the player who placed said garlic to give away one of their vampires).  

Quick, easy, fast, and fun. Scales beautifully for adults as well as children, and also plays fine for 2 (playing with four colors instead of the full six).  

The theme might not be suitable for some children (vampires, graves, coffins, a cemetary), but the graphics and design is playful enough that it's equivalent to a Halloween old-fashioned ghost story - the vampires are cartoonish and non-threatening but are as "friendly" as Casper the Ghost. The bits and  game board are beautifully designed (no wood like many Zoch games, but still first rate). 

If you aren't into horror-themed games or memory games, I'd still give this a try; it has a casual party vibe to it that may hook you.

I own an enormous wooden copy of this game that must have been used for demoing at conventions or something. It weighs approximately a million pounds and lives in my garage. That seems like a lot of hassle for a children's game. But I'll let you in on a secret. I've shamelessly enjoyed this game with all adults as well.

This is first and foremost a memory game, and that really is not my preferred type of game. I enjoy making decisions in games, especially when there isn't necessarily a "correct" answer. But memory games, like trivia games, demand a different type of intellect which is a binary right/wrong answer and I find that much less compelling. That said, there are a few other little twists that make this a good deal better than plain old Memory. 

First of all, you are trying to match a couple of your cards to the board, rather than all players finding matches on the board. So a spot on the board that is not useful to you may be quite valuable to someone else. This creates interesting interaction. Another problem with memory games is that you can sometimes end your turn by revealing an easy point for the next player, but this game solves that with "cloves of garlic." Essentially, when revealing a spot you cannot use, you may put garlic under it which protects if from being turned over. If someone forgets that your garlic is there and reveals it, not only do they not get a match, but you get to give them one of your cards. Finally, as the game progresses, matches get harder and harder to find as the graves fill up with vampire cards, and yet are not removed. Remembering which ones are empty and which ones are full is an important skill. 

I find it very hard to believe anyone could keep perfect track of everything on the board (which is usually possible in most memory games) and that overall confusion creates a shared experience with the other players, leading to memorable emotional moments when revealing those spots on the board. It's been well received by all kids and adults I've tried it with, so even though it doesn't really check all the boxes for me, it seems destined to be a keeper.

This is more of a kids style game, a lot of memory involved.  The game, board and bits are really high quality, all very nicely done.  Game flows well and we all laugh and make vampire comments.   A 4 year old can play it easily.  We don't use the rat tokens at all though and the game doesn't seem to suffer at all.***A year later, the kids still bring this one out to play and it has held up well and is still enjoyed.

It's a memory game, but with vampires and garlic and stakes and rat plagues.  As a minor nitpick, I'm not that thrilled with the art (the style is a weird sort of European-cartoony thing), but it's not bad and the game is solid.  Quite challenging, really.

RATING: 6
Yeah, it's just a memory game, but there are elements that take the formula and just make it more fun.  Most notable is the fact that as the game goes on, and more crypts get filled, the game gets harder and more tense, because a mistake can set you back.  This increasing risk element gives it a sort of "Can't Stop" flavor (even though you normally always take just one turn), along with the whooping it up that comes along.

I notice that folks in our group who played it (Dave Arnott, Lincoln) gave it among the highest ratings, so the fun is probably very dependent on the group and the mood.

I only gave it a 6 because, although it's very good for what it is, it still is what it is... a memory game.

Rated from a child's point of view. The theme may be a bit too much for the young ones. I suggest just not talking about the theme then and just focus on the game-elements.

It's colourful and is basically just memory (with a little twist to teach them some more gaming aspects to move on after this). This means they are good at it and have a good chance of winning from me.

Light memory game.  I will pick this one up when my kids are a little older.  Funny to play with adults who can't remember anything.  Nice looking board.  Rat plagues are worthless...not sure why they are even in the game. 

Edit: Did in fact pick it up now that the kids are older and they loved it.  Even my 3 year old can participate, which is rare. Still feel the same about the rat plagues. 

Update: My three year old is now five and this is by far her favorite game.  She'd rate it a 10...always wants to play it and is constantly pushing it to the table.  We play a shortened version where you start with fewer vampires and only get one garlic.

I am rating this as a children's game.  This is an excellent variation on the typical "memory" game that is so popular with children(probably because it is one of the few non-dexterity games in which kids can routinely beat their parents).   We play with only 2 or 3 rats in the game as the information gained from "rat plagues" is so significant that I feel the events should come more infrequently.  The garlic provides an interesting hint of "screw your neighbor" to the game (although it nicely avoids direct conflict because you never know who will spring your trap -- indeed it might be yourself on a subsequent turn.

We played this once with friends and had a very enjoyable time. The game is very light, and suitable for children. We are not usually interested in memory games, but this one really has a twist. After most of the vampires are "buried," it gets truly frightening to open a coffin that you aren't sure about. You can almost imagine the vampire jumping out to grab you. On the other hand, it is just a memory game - probably great for parties, but not something we would be likely to grab off the shelf first.

Memory game with a fun theme. Unlike basic memorygames this one gets harder as game progresses towards the end. Setting up the game takes a while and it is too much hassle for just one game. Luckily it is fast enough to play 2-3 games. Two-player game is very different and not very good. Surprisingly playable even with 6 players but better with 3-5 players.

[Children's Game] A memory game with a unique twist. Fun to play with children. The age recommendation on the box is "six and up", which is very suitable, since the game is a little long for a 6-year-old, and the rules and strategies are also a bit demanding. 

My tester (age 6) was very successful at opening empty graves, but she did not manage to take her strategy to the next level. That is, trying to open graves that match the vampire colors she already has available. For her younger sister (age 5) the game was way too complex and therefore uninteresting.

Very good component quality, both in terms of graphics and durability.

Played once.

A beautiful game but quite complex.

A memory game that is perhaps too hard because there is so much to remember.

Also, it's too long in my opinion.  The end game is tedious because finding the empty tombs is so hard.

Wouldn't want to play again.

My 6 year old son liked it though.

RATING: 6
With more players means you have to remember more when it comes to your turn, so the memory element can be so overwhelming. (But you need more players so that you don't start with many vampires). Then there are the situations where players have won by others mis"stakes". Can I say that the tactical blocking of the garlic can leave a bad taste in the mouth for some. Otherwise, there is some fun and tension from uncertainty of "what's in this crypt", and what you do find (Ahhh, garlic). All this has made this game  popular.

Tough memory game. Fun if the players don't take it too serious.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It simply has too many places to remember (60?!) - that's beyond most human's ability to reasonably recall, so it boils down to "Can I take advantage of a player before me finding a garlic for a color I need?".

I was surprised at the multiple negative gameplay elements - a player is punished when picking a grave that's already occupied, and punished when there's a garlic in there (15 in a 5 player game, and they get re-used so more like 25).
Later in the game, there simply aren't enough unoccupied graves to reasonably put the vampires into. Since the garlic doesn't go away (and that doesn't feel right - I'm thinking they should be removed when found), the cumulative penalties of opening occupied graves and finding garlic would become interminable.

I think house rules could only help this title - reducing the stake penalty to 5 or so, and removing the garlic would help gameplay, and most importantly - [b]reduce the game play length[/b] : that's the real problem with the punishing aspects- they all increase game length (which is a killer for a memory kid's game).

A memory game that gets harder, not easier, as the game progresses.  Not only does one need to remember the colour of the crypt, but more importantly, one needs to remember which are filled.

Nice theme and bits - good for a memory game. The end drags FOR AGES if you can't find the last couple of graves.

As a variant I'd say that you can declare a winner when one player gets down to their last four vampires (in a 2-3 player game), or two vampires (in a 4-6 player game). Without this house rule I'd rate this game a 4 because it can just drag on and on and on... well past its 30 minute welcome.

Also, you should never be allowed to turn over the same grave in a subsequent turn unless you can place a vampire in it - if you can't then it's the same penalty as three stakes.

Quite frankly, I enjoy playing Dawn Under more than playing Fury of Dracula - so my rating has to reflect that. (Note: gameplay is nothing alike.) Seriously, this is the best game I've played that strongly features a memory mechanic. In Dawn Under, each player tries to find available coffins (located in a graveyard - spooky!) for his/her vampires before the burning sun climbs over the horizon. 60 vampires are evenly divided between the players, and each arranges them in a row like this: XXOOOOOOOOOOOOXX, where the X's represent upturned vampires and the O's represent hidden (turned down) vampires. (As vampires either enter coffins or go to other players, new vampires are turned up to maintain the "two up on each side" configuration. The first player to successfully place all vampires into empty coffins wins. A player turning up a coffin lid on an occupied coffin must collect a wooden stake. Collect three stakes, and each of your opponents gets to unload one vampire on you. So, a player that keeps blundering into taken coffins will collect more and more vampires from other players. Each player also has three garlic tokens which can be placed into empty coffins (for those situations where you reveal a coffin that does not match the color of one of your available vampires). The garlic acts a little like a bomb - a player that uncovers one must take a vampire from the garlic owner. If the garlic owner stumbles into her own garlic, each other player gives her a vampire. Ouch!

In the early stages of the game, it's a race to find matching coffins. But as the coffins begin to fill, the focus turns more towards avoiding stake collection and strategically placing garlic (and trying to recall where you placed it!). Games progress at a good speed, providing just the right amount of reward for the work required by the game (actually more so, as not that much work is required [complexity wise - memory work is another thing altogether]). The theme is just beautiful. These are the cutest vampires you can imagine, making the game perfect for little kids who like things to be "scary" but who aren't truly ready for serious scares. The coloration is vibrant and fun, the stakes aren't sharpened, and the vampires look like they would give great hugs. The  other memory game in our household is Enchanted Forest. I don't see it getting played again. If you have kids, get this game. If you don't, but you like memory games, this is a great one.

RATING: 6
[Zoch 04 edition] {Vampire, kid; memory; optimal 4-6p} Dawn Under is a challenging memory game for adults and kids. The rules are more complex than other memory games and it requires the greatest memory span.

The major problem of this game is the late game dragging especially when everyone knows that only garlic remains.  Some house rules must be present to destroy all garlics at late game; for example, each player is given chances to name whether a coffin contains a garlic - if he's right, throw the garlic away and place his vampire, if he's wrong get vampires from the previous player.  Or each garlic can only be used once.

The coffins, garlic and vampires are very cute and sturdy.  The artwork is hilarious.  Very suitable for children to play.

Since there are around 60 coffins, it's impossible to remember all occupied coffins. Therefore, the vampires are frequently transferred to each player continually, which embraces plenty of player interactions.  Despite the chaos, players with better memory have higher chance of winning. DU may drag on when all players are looking for a vacant coffin by trial and error :laugh:

This is a good try for first-time designer.  Keep up the good work!

[Expansion] "Frische Luft fur die Gruft" is a very good expansion. It increases player interaction and provide more tactical options. It's not expensive. Better get this.

Kids will like it better than I did.  This is a whimsical game about finding empty graves in which to put your vampires.  Put your vampires to rest first and you win the game.  Setup time was a little too long for my liking.  You have to shuffle tons of tiles and then place them all on the game board before you can begin.  My kids liked the play but the memory element was way too heavy for my liking.  Still, good with the right group.

I can see the interest and challenge in the game, but my short-term memory is awful, and when I try to remember where 40 coffin lids are located on the board, the game becomes too much like work.  I can see how this would play differently with more players, but still....  Cute, and interesting, but not my thing.

Fun memory game.  Good artwork, nice components.  Many things to try to remember in this: garlic, grave colors, empty graves.  Can be rather difficult.

This game's a great example of why ratings are mostly silly. If you don't like memory games, you won't like this, as it doesn't pretend to be anything else. But if you do (and I do, as my memory is faulty but malleable), this is best of breed. Totally different feel than most of this ilk, as it gets more difficult as it proceeds. I like the endgame conditions (where you may win by giving a vampire away), as it creates more tension for everyone and prevents interminable vampire-swapping. The rats are a little complex for kids, but it's nice to break up the routine, so...hard call.

RATING: 6.8
A solid memory game with heavy Euro overtones in that there more than just a memory element but an objective that requires strategy even if only in small amounts.  The board and bits are of excellent quality and the game is simple and fun both with kids and adults or any combination thereof.

Een unieke manier van memory, die daadwerkelijk moeilijker wordt naarmate het spel vorderd.

It's basically memory. There are some twists however. I think that for adults this game is about a 4.5, but with kids I could see it going up a bit. Playing with 6 is extremely difficult, and you will be amazed when you see how many graves were empty at the end.

Holy crap!  This game is hard!  For a kids memory-style game, this one can't be beat.  Excellent, excellent quality, cute graphics (I like the toilet paper roll in one of the crypts, btw).  Towards the end, turning over lids was intense - lots of anxiety on my part, I just wanted to bonk my head against the table.  Even my husband said that as far as memory games go, this is the best one he's ever played.

It is really complex and confusing memory game. Very funny but hard to remember. Rat plague seems broken and hard to understand for kids.

Pure memory games shouldn't be this rock steady.

Stake! Garlic! Stake! Garlic!

If only all minions of the undead could be defeated with simple tricks of cognitive recall.

Played once (with 5 players). It is not much more than a plain memory game, but the production is nice and the little vampires are cute.

Great quality components. Great art. Basically a memory game with a little strategy (you can hide 'traps' under empty graves)

This is probably the most fun I've ever had playing "Memory".  I'm terrible at it, but it's OK for what it is and it's fun even when it isn't your turn (the tension if someone uncovers a crypt with a vampire or not).

This game is goofy...but I like it.  It's essentially a memory game, but don't kid yourself, it's tough.  I always have fun playing Dawn Under despite it's simplicity.

Yes, I know, it's a memory game, but it's a good one. And it's hard. I mean really hard.

Great fun this kiddie game. Essentially just a memory game (which I suck at), but for some reason I had a blast when I played this.

Juego de memoria en el que debes intentar colocar a tus vampiros en las criptas de su color evitando los ajos.

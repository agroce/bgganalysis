If you're going to jump into PT this is the set to get. Comprehensive rules, interesting variant play styles, and solid cards to start with. I've enjoyed all of PT, but this set is great. And it comes in a nice solid box that will fit your whole collection.

An amazingly fun game!  I almost didn't buy this game because I don't like manga/chibi-style art, but I'm so glad I did.  A rich, deep tactical gaming experience combined with easy rules (once you get familiar with the sequence of play), fairly quick play, and incredible variety.  Add to this affordable cost, deck-building options and best of all excellent solo rules found in the BGG files sections makes this an 11, not a 10.  This rating is for all the Pixel tactics sets, which, conveniently, all fit, sleeved in the Deluxe box.

RATING: 8.6
The only thing that would make this better is if a playmat were included. However, it does at least come with a better paper one than the backside of the rulebooks. Beyond that you've got a nice sturdy collector's box for all your previous Pixel Tactics sets. AND it serves as a 'Pixel Tactics 6' with new sets of characters, new artwork Leader cards, dividers, and a smaller bonus pack. Unless you're just satisfied with a single Pixel Tactics pack, then I'd say this was an essential accessory/expansion in one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a fun one-on-one team-based card game. The artwork is reminiscent of old 8-bit fighting games, as indicated by the name, and it looks good. Characters are interesting and game design straightforward while supporting a surprising amount of depth. A good game worth picking up for when you need a two-player game.

Certainly not a bad game, but definitely NOT for me. The strategy skills needed is very intense, and the way the cards are designed is just fiddly and visually confusing. It's too easy too look at the wrong thing at the wrong time, and you pretty much have to have already played it several times to have any chance of doing well. I can't really think how the card layouts could have been improved for easier readability, at least not in any sort of reasonable or inexpensive way, but geez. Really disliked it.

Side note- This will not impact my rating of the game, I know I like the game as I own and play Pixel Tactics 1-3 but I feel it is worth mentioning the awful treatment of backers especially EU backers by Level 99 games. Not just delays which is to be expected in Kickstarter projects but the severity of the delays for a mostly complete card game, the long periods of silence, the biggest issue I have is that people lucky enogth to be able to attend bgg.con picked this up months ago, The US were deliverd this in December, Retail outlits started selling the game in January, there was no real backer bonus for pre ordering this through kickstarter and EU backers paid alot more for supporting this project yet were treated like we do not matter to Level 99 and still have not recieved the project.

I was interested in Pixel Tactics from the first time I saw a video about it on Youtube. At the time, it was very hard to find Pixel Tactics in Western Australia. I managed to get my hands on a copy of Pixel Tactics 3, which I carried with me everywhere.

Then I saw the Kickstarter for the Deluxe version, incorporating all the different versions that were so hard to find. Delighted. While I don't have a regular opponent to really dig into the game with, I love introducing others to this - there's a fair bit of randomness to the inexperienced, so it's a great game to keep lighthearted in.

i am very much enjoying this game as i have been wanting it for almost 10 months when i first discovered PT. it still has some of the disappointingly amateurish mistakes weve seen from the company with typos and inconsistent language on the cards etc. several of the HD cards are completely different than their originals, but in all, if youre a fan of the series, it really is something you'll want to find to hold your cards from older sets and complete the collection.

The rulebook also has quite a bit of new playstyles, which is really awesome coming from someone who likes to play multiple formats of MTG. Cannot recommend this game enough.

Daughter and I love Pixel Tactics, and the Deluxe box is a nice addition.  Very sturdy box, nice dividers for everything, holds sleeved cards very well.  Additional chits help track status effects in the game and a nice updated rulebook that isn't on the flip side of the paper game mat.  Only thing that could have made this better would have been to have a playmat or fold out board instead of the cheap paper mats (instead of a separate purchase that likely won't fit in the deluxe box anyhow).

Too much reading when you first play, and the iconography isn't that helpful. The balance is bad too. But all of that is kind of the point, and with the right playing partner this can be a ton of fun as you learn the decks together.

I love Pixel Tactics, but I haven’t played the deluxe edition. I hope to do it soon, but there are some things that bug me.

First of all, I have been unable to find the rulebook online. Level 99 Games has some rulebooks on their website, but they are obsolete. In this day and age, not having access to the rulebook seem ludicrous. (The last online rulebook I could find was Pixel Tactics 3).

Second, they changed a lot of core rules. I hate when publishers do this and Level99 do this often (besides Pixel Tactics, they changed BattleCON: War of Indines and NOIR: Deductive Mystery Game) so buying their games when they just come to the market seems like a bad idea. They will change it within the year and your game will become obsolete. I’m talking about core rules changes, if they just reworded the cards so they would be clearer I wouldn’t have an issue, but they change the core rules and that’s very disrespectful with the original backers, supporters and customers who bought the game in the first place. This deluxe edition, changes the amount of cards you can have in your hand, attack powers no longer exist so they don’t trigger “attack effects” and I’m sure there are other changes I haven’t seen yet (perhaps how traps work). The changes seem small and they are, but they have a huge impact in play and having two sets of rules is difficult when playing with other players who doesn’t know the updated rules. If you are going to change something, you can do it as an official variant  when you release an expansion, but that’s not the case here. If I want to have all my Pixel Tactics updated, I would have to buy again the number 1 2, and 3 sets.

Third, the deluxe edition comes with many new cards (chase leaders, bases, commons) but the rules to play with them are in effect only if you play in league mode, not casual mode. Furthermore they explain some of the cards in a small couple of paragraphs while the rulebook is many pages long. On the good side it does explain many ways (some new) to play the game.

Bottom line, I’m disenchanted with any publisher who changes the core rules of its games. So far I have encountered this behavior with Level 99 Games and with Stonemaier Games (Viticulture has changed 3 times in 3 years and they also changed Euphoria :/).

Initial rating: 7.0 (October 2016)

I finally played Pixel Tactics Deluxe. The game box works great to hold all the previously released sets, it even holds the sleeved cards without any issue :thumbsup:. I don’t know if it will hold the upcoming Megaman set but I think so as the box still has lots of room for cards.
 
The deluxe edition comes with a comprehensive rulebook that adds many ways to play (a huge plus) but it also changed some previously established rules (a huge minus). Besides the great box, it also comes with 25 new heroes/leaders, with bases, common cards, dividers and chase leaders and that’s great! At this point, the replayability of the whole series is through the roof. I love the idea of mixing sets to change the game, many of my favorite games have this characteristic (Dungeon Twister, Dominion, Summoner Wars).
 
I have only played with it once, so I still  cannot comment about the power level of each card. It added traps, a mechanism that was new for me (I think Pixel tactics 4 added traps before but I haven’t played with it yet) and I really liked it. Having traps in play makes your opponent much more cautious, it is a physiological gambit that I love.

The art continues to be good, I like pixel art.

I feel bad that I played this edition first before playing Pixel tactics 3,4 and 5. I will make an effort to get those played in order, mainly to see how each set evolve and build upon the sets that came before.

As with any other Pixel Tactics, the game is easy to teach (you can do in under 7 minutes), fun to play (every card has 5 different uses), has meaningful decisions, and it plays in about 35 minutes if both players know the game (1 hour with new players). Some matches can be longer than that if you can heal your leader a lot but that’s a minor issue for me.

Bottom line, Pixel Tactics Deluxe is a good 2 player game with lots of depth and replayability. The deluxe box is very welcomed and I want to play the game again soon. A keeper in my game collection.

Kickstarted and got everything. Lots of smart things to do, and tons of options with each card. Wave system works great and leads to great moments. Each leader makes your team work in a completely different way. Not sure if the best of it's kind, but the one I enjoy the most. Only problem is that it competes for table-time with other 2 player games such as BattleCon, which is better.

Pixel Tactics the BigBox (tm) edition. Nice storage solution with some nice extra cards, some fun pretty stuff and some stuff that probably won't ever hit your table (looking at you, bases and common card decks thingie). Great way to complete your collection but only really something I'd recommend if you're already a fan. Due to price (compared to normal PT1-5 sets) I would NOT recommend this as a starting point to see whether or not you like Pixel Tactics.

Pixel Tactics Deluxe is a perfect place to start playing the game. This large box contains enough cards for two players, rules, punch tokens, and storage space for all the other Pixel Tactics games in print.

Fun game with some great design ideas. Improved with the purchase draft mode so that players don't have to spend time deck building. "Common" cards help reduce the complexity of the game.

Cons: 
- Overly-complex board states with too much text to keep track of.
- Some imbalanced cards

Would love to try campaigns, but it's so difficult finding players.

As an added bonus, this particular entry in the Pixel Tactics series comes with a sturdy box with which to hold your entire Pixel Tactics collection and then some! Also comes with not just two standard decks (one in each color), but also an exclusive minipack, a collection of bases and commons (for league play), a large number of HD leader cards, and a comprehensive rulebook with many new gameplay modes.

Easily the best of the Pixel Tactics series so far and a great deal whether you are new to Pixel Tactics or a seasoned veteran!

This is quite possibly the best collector box I have ever seen. It fits all the other pixel tactics beautifully in 2 ways. you can take the cards out of their individual boxes and separate the games with the included dividers (which there are enough to indicate each individual game, each expansion, and a bunch of extras for deck building and are very high quality), or keep them in their individual boxes and put the boxes themselves in the bigger collector's box. I have mine setup with the cards taking up 2 of the 3 rows, and the 3rd row I keep the blue and red pixel tactics boxes. The red box contains all the hitpoint counters, and the blue one has all the statuses and player markers. The box itself is very sturdy and extremily well built. No exposed cardboard edges or anything. It is LEGIT.

Initial impressions. I've never played Pixel Tactics before; I kickstarted the whole package and when it arrived I felt very leery. "Uh oh, another bad choice in kickstarters." Then I played with my son. Oh my. This is a lot of craziness in one tiny package. So many cards, so overpowered. He womped me, I womped him. I set up killer moves and then he killed me in one move before I could execute. This is semi controlled chaos and loads of fun. Three downchecks: The chaos may be too much for some; there is certainly skill and planning, but only up to a point, and chaos dominates. This is not a thinky brain burner game, or shouldn't be. Downcheck 2, analysis paralysis players might make it a long draggy game, insisting on checking every card as it comes into play, that would make this game much less fun. Downcheck 3, tiny text. I'm 52, my eyes no so good no more. I can handle the small print but it's smaller than is comfortable. That's not really bad game design as there is only so much space, but it still is an issue.

The whole deluxe package is very nice. A big box with dividers to hold all the cards. The rules could be a wee bit better written, and I can foresee the need to go online and search out errata, but so far I'm very pleased.

Honestly worth it just for the box if you, like me, have a ton of Pixel Tactics stuff.  The box will hold everything they've made so far with plenty of room for more. It also comes with it's own set of new hero cards, some of the vanity leader cards, new bases cards, and new common hero cards (although I think the common hero cards are kind of worthless).  Oh, and dividers to separate and organize all your cards and a new rulebook.  The rulebook is also a welcome change to the giant city map-sized rule poster they had been including in their games.

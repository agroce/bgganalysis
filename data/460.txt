A great game. Very playable. I played in, and ran, lots of postal games in the 1970s and 1980s, when it was probably the 2nd most popular postal game, after Diplomacy. I own 20 or so of the original maps, and my kids all played it as they grew up. Still a regular to play when we get together at Christmas, etc.

RATING: 5
This didn't quite do it for me, which is a shame because it looks and feels like it ought to be a very likeable game. I felt overly handicapped by poor dice rolls/turn order in the initial building phase, watching as others to beat me to contested routes and cities (boo hoo).

An old classic of building railroads and then "racing" trains that is as much fun today as when it first appeared back in the 70s.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A very simple rail game with a "racing" element thrown into the mix instead of a "business" element.  It's fun, but not as much fun as the "business" railroad games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The grand-daddy of all the crayon rail games. Perhaps a little too reliant on dice rolls for modern tastes but, over the game, the sheer number of rolls entirely mitigates the random element and the most efficient networks are always, always rewarded. Lots of alternative maps around for variety too. Cant go wrong with this one.

RATING: 6
A distant cousin to the Empire Builder series of games, Railway Rivals (and the German version, Dampfross) work a lot better with larger numbers (3+) of players than Empire Builder does. Not a great classic, as it takes a bit too long to play for what it is and has a modest downtime problem, but still a decent game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I really like the game concept of building tracks and then racing the trains, but this one runs far too long for it to be all that enjoyable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun railway building game from the mid-seventies. The dice rolling aspect of the 'races' may put some off but the rolls generally even out to reward the better railway planner and provide quite a lot of unexpected excitement. The London/Liverpool map plays quite differently from the Western USA map with its sparsely populated centre and everyone starting along the same edge. NB. Trying to win in the latter scenario without building westwards is unlikely to work. Very good for such an oldie!

London/Liverpool map - 3 plays. Western USA map - 10 plays.

House rule: I recommend playing with hidden money to maintain the suspense throughout the game with turn order rotating around the table.

RATING: 7
Same game as Dampfross, which I own. - There is just something magical about railroad games for me. I love building things. This game really focuses on route building and if you use a 2,3,3,4,4,5 die it cuts back on some of the luck. But I've never felt a need to do this I also like the racing part of the game.

It was more engaging than I would have thought. I think the dice rolling is a bit unnecessary, but I'd play it again.

After one play, I find I get the track building and connections of a crayon-rail game, with the excitement of racing.  Very nice game, only marred by length (we played about 2 hours, and were about 2/3 done).  If the playing time comes down, rating will go up.

This game looks like the precursor to the crayone rails series.  You can tell it is old as the mechanics show their age.  Lots of luck involved. You build your rail network before you know anything about what deliveries your going to be able to make.  Luck in how the cards come out determine whether you can compete for deliveries.  If you can't, this game has a lot of downtime.  Also, the deliveries are based on die-rolling, so more luck there.  I'm not sure this deserves a 6, but the die-rolling/racing is kind of a hoot...cheering for 6's and bemoaning the 1's.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Crayon rail game where players draw their tracks on the board.  At a certain point in the game, races begin over the drawn tracks.  Races are dice driven, which may deter some, however it's a fun game.  Same game as Dampfross.

Swedish traslation of the game. The possetive is that more maps seams to be part of the game then i the original. Sadly enough the translation is bad. The trains are cubes and all money is gone and replaced with points that you pay to build and get fore lines. Have played the enlish version and that is superior. The rating is the translated swedish version. If I owned the original one I would have given it a higher rating.

RATING: 10
Excellent edition of a great railway game, what the Americans style as a crayon-rail game because you draw the railways on the board as you progress. The racing is a simple dice-roller, but the mix of drawing rails and then racing and then spending the proceeds drawing more rails keeps the game interesting throughout. David Watts has produced a wide variety of laminated maps. This edition has England and US maps.

RATING: 5
An old standard that hasn't aged well. It predates pretty much every other train game, including 18xx, so you can forgive it its simple nature, but the genre has come a long way since this came out. OK there's an element of trying to build efficient routes, but it isn't worth thinking too hard and playing time kills it for me (3 hours on some maps).

This was one of my favorites during the '90s, but for some reason it didn't get played very often in our group.  I think the crayon drawing and numerous variant maps reminds people of Empire Builder, which is a turn off for some, but it's really a very different game.

Basically it's Games Workshop's version of Dampfroß.  The British map plays better than the US, but the game still flows very well.  Luck of the draw can give a player a bit of an edge, but the game's length tends to even out the luck elements.

Well deserving of its Spiel des Jahres.

I'm a sucker for any game where you build something in the first stage and play out different mechanics across it in the second. Vanilla D6 roll-and-move as a noisy way to determine the most efficient of several routes is an amusing sort of horse race for a while, but takes far too long.

RATING: 5
Definitely a good bit of dice rolling in this game which will drive some people crazy with the luck factor.  With the number of times you have to roll the die, the luck likely evens out to some extent.  The game is composed of two parts.  First, you seek to build your railroad network which ideally can get to many places in the USA or Europe.  The other part of the game is then all about racing with a slight bit of track building involved after every other race.  In both phases, the die controls much of the action as phase one you roll the die to determine how much money you can use to build track and in the second phase you roll the die to determine how far you go on the track in the race.  To me, if the game was a half hour shorter, I would enjoy the game much more, but it tends to drag on too long.

Venerable railway building game from David Watts. Millions (OK dozens) of maps are available to give a bit of variety. The track drawing is the heart of the game, and it is nice watching your network develop (or not). It lacks the sophistication of more modern counterparts and the races are just not that much fun. 8 by post, 5 face-to-face.

I really enjoy the tension of the building and then the racing phase.  An interesting and simple game that has been pushed aside by the crayon rail games and others.

Very elegant design that is really two games in one.  Building efficient routes while picking up city bonuses is part one.  Racing for serious cash is part two.   The fun is in the racing.  We usually played with six players which gives you lots of options for partnering with other players during the races.  Sure there is lots of luck but the drama is high.

The original and best rail game if you want a life as well. Easy rules, gets more outings than any other game I own. Some maps work much better than others - our favourite is the Lancs/Yorks map. Racing can get tedious as closing the gap on an early leader can be difficult.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.8
Perhaps not something that holds up very well these days, but of great historical significance. The first half of the game, in which players extend routes, competing for the $6,000 bonus granted to the first to connect to each city, is decidedly more interesting than the second half's roll and move race game. Too long, for certain, it benefits from some serious house ruling. A game system that cries out for a contemporary update, as there's a great concept at its core.

An inferior ancestor to the modern day crayon games, hence no need to have this in the collection anymore. The reward for efficient track here is simply to be the first to build to various cities and then improve your odds of winning the end-game race, though if dice go against you, too bad, game over. I much prefer the newer challenges of finding time-efficient deliveries, which make more thematic sense as well.

RATING: 8
The game of railbuilding and racing.  The racing element is bit random and long, recommend a couple fixes:
-  Roll multiple colored dice and treat the red die as the first rolled, white and second, blue is third, etc.  Ignore any dice that aren't need to complete the route.  This cuts race time in half.
-  Use averaging dice (2,3,3,4,4,5 OR treat 1 as a 3 and 6 as a 4.)  This greatly reduces the luck element without eliminating it.

I haven't actually played RR since I was a student in  the 1980s but it is an important game for me as it convinced me that playing board games as an adult could be fun. Shame I then waited so long to notice that the Germans (and occasionally others) were producing fun, interesting games for grown-ups that I would enjoy.

RATING: 2
Yuk.  I had nearly 0 fun during my one and only game of Railway Rivals.  Building track was often annoying as you would watch someone else beat you to a certain city.  So I hated the building...  which is easily 3 hours worth of game alone.   I also didn't enjoy the races...  mountains were a pain in the ass, and the chaos of the dice made some sure things - losing propositions.  Overall, I can say that some of the mechanics were interesting, but the game was WAY, WAY, WAY too long to be fun.

Surprisingly fun. It's roll-and-move, but everyone's racing on their own track that they built during the game. Once the race starts it's in the "hands" of the dice and you're only a spectator. Still, it's pretty exciting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Classic railway race game. The game is split into two phases, the first where players construct their lines on a map using marker pens, the second where players race along the constructed tracks from one city to another by rolling dice. Points are awarded for being the first and second player to run a train between two particular cities. The game was way ahead of its time when originally published and has set the template for many railway games that have followed. It has dated in some ways since, which is understandable considering its age, with the rolling of dice for racing purposes proving to be unsatisfactory. There is still a lot to admire here though and far from being a complete luckfest the game does reward good strategic decisions during the route building.

Played once.  I liked the two phases of the game.  I found the track building interesting as you try to have the most efficient network between the approximately 36 dots.  The race was also clever in your ability to use others networks for a fee.  The dice also wasn't a big deal because generally if you have the shortest route you will win and there are enough races that it should balance out.  
What I had a little trouble with was the order the races came out.  If the first couple races come out, when the networks are fairly independent, on your network, it's a big advantage; you get 10-30k advantage on your opponents and there is so much more track building and the number of available race locations is being reduced that by the end everybody is everywhere the trains will go and the last few races are pretty evenly distributed.  That early advantage was about the margin of victory.  I would need to play some more to see if this can be overcome by clever track building or not. 2008/06/20

Innovative in its day but past its sell-by date. OK, it now looks a bit rubbish.

Brilliant game, just the right combination of simple rules and complex strategy with a touch of luck. I can still hear David's voice echoing round conventions summoning players...

A fine game by email or post when you have a GM to do the dull bits for you.  But face-to-face, it will bore you to death. Far, far too long for what it is, especially in the racing rounds when there is less skill than in Snakes & Ladders.

A classic older game which could do with a significant facelift, both on the components and in the rules

I am the owner of many maps, having purchased personally from the game designer. This game keeps coming out of the gaming cupboard year after year.

Quicker than Empire Builder and more enjoyable with the varied mapboards

An old favourite. I've made my own maps – fun to play, although a bit messy because of the use of felt pens.

I was very, very surprised about this beautiful 2 player game. I think it is very good balanced, smart and have a nice theme. The artwork is great and it is addictive. It is not a game where war is the center point. No, it is a high light and often the last option to fight against your opponent. The game feeling is absolutly great. I don't know what I play first, when I want to play a 2 player game. Twilight Struggle or Polis - for me... both are the same extremly good stuff.

This game might forever be better than I can appreciate. My first play was extremely rough, second play improved my understanding. It isn't terribly complex in the end (although I feel the combat system is overwrought) and moves along steadily. It is perhaps a touch too tight in construction, but other than that, I can't knock any aspect. I like it as a two player war-euro, but it has little chances to get to my game table.

Visto vídeos, leídas y entendidas a la perfección las reglas, y tras probarlo... juegazo!
Se nota que se han reducido las reglas para ser más jugable, porque es un concepto de juego magnífico. Un gran gestión de recursos, con mayorías, bloqueos de comercio, etc. más que centrado en la lucha directa (que también está muy conseguida y sencilla con las cartas) consiguiendo meterte en el tema y la tensión de las guerras del Peloponeso entre las dos ciudades.

Hay que sacar tiempo y probarlo más.

Pretty good.  I am just getting into it now.  It strikes me as being as tough and unforgiving as a Martin Wallace game like Age of Steam.  You sometimes have to do three things to do the one that you want to do or you get in a mess.  I'm sure that there are many ways to increase your efficiency, but it's also partly about surviving at the start and making sure your people are fed.

Fantastic take on the Peloponnesian Wars, this has some abstractions and yet any reader of Thucydides will notice they are often adopting historical strategies.  It is very unforgiving though.

A fantastic game that is not only mechanically fun but also very thematic to those who know about the theme. I was surprised how many times I was saying: "This really happened in history." For example, never having enough food and especially never really being able to knock the other league fully out of the war or even in cases an area around a polis. The game mechanics are also really tight and balanced, keeping the game feeling very tense as one mistake could mean tipping the fragile balance of Athens and Sparta. The many extra cards, projects and scenarios also means a lot of replay value. The game rules are also not too hard to understand for the dept of play offered. 
 
Downside is the card quality and the tracking board has cubes on it's flat surface, meaning an unlucky bump loses the information unless you remember it. 

Lastly there is a decent tutorial online by connectmore but I still suggest reading the rulebook afterwards to clarify some details. In conclusion, theme, game and a reasonable amount of rules, not to be missed.

RATING: 7
A light medium weight resource maximizing-for victory points game.

Beautiful production on components, but the map though beautiful, seems slightly smaller for the wood cubes and disc that comes with it.

The number of pages in rules booklet could be cut in half as the other half are just designer notes and chrome.

The geographic location for Athenians and Spartans render their strategies towards a naval or hoplites heavy/dependency plan. In such a set up, and uneven distribution of initial resources, it's inevitable the resource management part of the game forces a certain strategy to be played. The war part of the game might not even happen among new gamers. But if veterans to this game, the battles on strategic locations would seem inevitable.

Overall, an entertaining game that is worth replays.

Great game for two! I like the setting and I like the mechanics. But it needs at least a second or maybe third game to fully grasp the way to play this. When and how far stretch the own forces?
Polis (cities) with low population are very vulnerable for a rebellion/civil war. Also no or too few forces in a home region allow the opponent to seize control there and then besiege the small "side" Polis - allowing the opponent to collect in your home region with is a MAJOR drawback.

RATING: 8.85
Speaking as a semi-retired grognard and current euro player, I have NEVER encountered a game as deep as Polis! From the grognard perspective, it is certainly not a wargame: combat is too abstracted and too rare to qualify for that. As for Polis being a euro, it ain't: the lack of control, the relatively detailed level of simulation, and the rather unique take on euroish mechanics rules that out. So what kind of game is it? It is Polis: currently, there is no other game like it.

The rules are easy enough to get a handle on (once one is past the poorly worded sections, especially regarding combat); but I think a lifetime may be required to master the game, which is why I rate it a 9, rather than a 10. There will be times when I'll hate Polis after losing due to my own incompetence. But then, I'll spend the next week thinking about how I could have done better, and then be eager to try again. A legal form of heroin, I guess. Even if you win a game of Polis, you'll still be thinking, "Yeah, that was good...I guess...but if only I had tried THIS, I would have won even better!" 

Fifty years from now, this game will still be played. I can't say that about many other games from the past ten years. It's a shame it can only be played with two.

A wargame where it is possible for the two sides to peacefully coexist?  A resource management game that I don't hate?  What strange beast is this?

Polis is about the management of seven resources.  All are not of equal value. Prestige is victory points, but needs to be spent in order to move your forces, harvest resources and do battle.  Ever more wheat is needed to feed a growing population  - and population is also victory points.  Then there is silver, the currency that funds your efforts to destabilise other city states and bring them into your faction.  Run short of any of those three and you will be falling behind in a game of only four turns.

What makes this resource management palatable for me is that it both drives and limits the growth of Athens and Sparta. This isn't a game of individual player boards and everyone contributing to build some monument to Greek culture; it is about two expanding powers whose "interaction" increases as the game progresses.

I also like how Polis is constantly presenting tough decisions: about the timing and ordering of actions, about how far you can expand while keeping everyone fed, and about those trade-offs of prestige points for actions.  Event cards add some historical spice and variability.

Others have mentioned the dratted four-sided dice and besieging.  I agree that this is the game's one real blemish.  The loss of actions represented by repeated failed siege rolls can be critical in a short, closely contested game.  However, as others have commented, this is an easy thing to house rule.  Of greater concern are event cards that can have a heavy impact on a game that's often a knife-edge struggle to feed your population and stay ahead of the other guy.

Production quality is excellent and the artwork is pleasing.  The rules are not written in idiomatic English, but, on early acquiantance, seem complete and, despite the odd turns of phrase, unambiguous.

At first glance, this seems to be a war-style area control game. 

WRONG! This is one of the tightest resource management games I have ever played, with players struggling to find the resources they want. 

Nice theme implementation. The two cities of Athens and Sparta really play diferrent. Clever battle mechanic.

I would definitely play this again!

Fantastic game.

The strategies start to become more clear and sophisticated with each match.

Athens won easily the first time, until we learned how to use the Spartan army advantage on the ground to deplete Athens of cubes and collect resources first.  Now I gotta learn how to counter that by using Athens' navies to choke the Spartan trading operation.

This game presents a very well balanced mix of empire building and resource management with a healthy dose of open conflict and manoeuvering without being a full fledged wargame.

Not to mention the good quality of the components.
This game will become a hit as soon as an american or a german publisher picks it up.

It is a great buy for both the euro and wargaming crowds.

Mostanában nem volt időm ilyen komplex játékokra, mint ez, kicsit meg is ijedtem a szabály hosszától, de szerencsére eléggé letisztult. Ritkán veszek manapság ránézésre játékot, de ezzel régóta szemeztem, valahogy már külsőre (és témára) meggyőzött. Szerintem elég erős wargame beütése van, és bár egy elég erős gazdasági vonal is van benne (a nyersanyagok nyilvántartására külön táblánk van), de szerintem az csak a díszlet. A csata rendszere nagyon emlékeztetett a Hannibáléra, annak ellenére, hogy más a konkrét szabálya, de azzal hogy külön paklival harcolgatunk, kap a játék itt is egy plusz dimenziót. Ott is tetszett, itt is tetszik, szerintem nagyon jó része a játéknak, még ha nem is volt benne szerencsém:) Ráadásul elég egyedi, hogy a csatának nincs egyfajta drámai vége (vesztettél, adózz, vagy vonulj vissza, stb.), inkább csak egyfajta ritkítás, ha túl sokan vannak egy mezőn:) A győzelmi pontokat nem a csata végén, hanem közben lehet szerezni (kivéve ha valaki önként visszavonul). Ami szintén tetszik, hogy nem csak ostromban, hanem ármánykodással (vesztegetéssel) is lehet várost szerezni, persze nem olcsó. A gazdasági rész (begyűjtés/kereskedelem) is egész egyedi, és a földrajzi apró kivételek és a 2 fél apró aszimmetriái tényleg wargame-es gondossággal vannak megalkotva: tematikus a játék (még a kaja is megromlik), de nem zavaróan sok a szabály, a segédlet részletes, de lehetne még alaposabb talán. Egy játék után nagyon úgy tűnik, hogy Athénnal a tengerre kell rágyúrni, Spártával meg a szárazföldre, bár a kezdést mi csak nüansznyi előnynek éreztük a csatában, az esetek nagyobb részében nem a kezdő nyert. Az események nagyon nagy változatosságban jelennek meg, egy játékban csak a tizedük kerül sorra (nem is beszélve a promó eseményekről). Talán ebben még lehetne jobb a játék, ha több esemény kerülne játékba, még jobban átjönne a hangulat, de elég erősek az események, szóval ha mondjuk 5-ször ennyi jönne, akkor kicsit káoszos lenne tőle az egész. A búza egyértelműen a játék kulcsa, de mindenképp sokutasnak érzem. Szinte mindenre van válasz: ha blokkolom a tengeren, akkor vagy nekem támad, vagy jön szárazföldön. Ha elfoglalom erővel a városát, átcsábít diplomáciával egy másik várost, stb. Egy olyan hibát érzek benne, hogy kis figyelmetlenséggel akár 15 perc alatt is el lehet szállni és game over:) De akkor max jön egy viszavágó. A leszakadás kérdése érdekes, én úgy éreztem, 10+ pontot már nem lehet behozni a 4. körben, de kockáztatva, rárontva az ellenfél városaira azért nem kizárt. A szerencse szerepe nem kicsi, két helyen jelenik meg durván: az ostrom egy kockadobással dől el, a csata meg kártyákkal:) Mégsem zavart, pedig van ahol szokott. Játékidő kezdőknél szerintem 1 óra/kör, de akinek sok a 4 kör, az játszhat 1 vagy 2 körös scenariót is! És még egy pozitívum: Bonyolultság ide, 12 féle akció oda... a játék végén a győztes megállapítása hihetetlenül egyszerű. 3 könnyen megjegyezhető tételből adódik össze a pontszám, nem kell 10 féle szirszar pontot összeszámolgatni (emiatt közben is elég jól követhető az állás!). Szabályban csak pár kérdéses dolog volt: pl. egy városban 1 féle projectből 1 építhető?
A játék nagyon hangulatos, és nívós, aki szereti a görög törit, vagy akár a wargame-eket, bonyolultabb statégiaiakat, annak mindenképp ajánlom. Ha lenne időm, szívesen játszanék vele rendszeresen is, de így pár hónapos gyerkőc mellett ez az 1 parti is csoda volt, viszont nagy erénye számomra, hogy fenn van a yucatán. Sajnálom, hogy ilyen ritkaságszámba megy, nagyobb ismertséget érdemelne! Nyelvfüggőség nem vészes, a játéksegédletet azért nem árt lefordítani.

This is a great addition to the civ/area control genre. The game features simple rules and is beatiful in the eye. However it is deeper than it seems at a first glance and takes a long time to master. There are several strategies available to try. I do not find it a design flaw, but the game is harder than what I would like, that is why I will probably not play it as often. However my excellent rating stands.

Rating after one play... Is it a Euro, Weuro, Empire building, Wargame or just a plain strategy game? For me, it is a combination of all of the above. ...but who cares what category it falls in! This gamer's game is an underrated gem that deserves a better following for it's excellent and clever design. 

There is definitely a learning curve to the strategies and mechanics that this game holds and a more experienced player will probably have the upper hand. The rules are relatively simple to understand, but the gameplay is deep. The components are excellent and beautiful with the only minor gripe being that the cards are a little on the thin side which was quickly fixed by sleeves. 

I'm looking forward to discovering the depth that this game has to offer. Fran Diaz will definitely be on my radar of designers to follow because of this game.

A very interesting and unique game unlike any other I have played. Every resource in the game (including your victory points) are a commodity that you need to spend to survive, grow, and prosper. The game truly has an interwoven feel, and while playing it you can feel that you are balancing on a knife's edge. From the start of the game, you have a wide open playing field and it can be hard to see which options to explore. The fact that many of the most useful actions in the game (such as collecting resources from your population) cost you prestige (victory points) makes each decision to try this a tough one. Resources and points are always at a premium, there is a difficult (Agricola-like) tension to feeding your population, and there is a great timing aspect to your actions and passing. 

It is the kind of game that will keep you thinking about it long after you have finished playing, and where you can tell that repeated play would pay off. A totally unique and innovative euro design that I would recommend everyone into heavier euro games tries at least once.

Although we played it with a wrong rule that would make the game slightly different, my will to play it again is very low.
It seems that the attacking side has some advantages and this causes that Sparta will rule the land and Athens the Sea. So Sparta will have the cities and Athens the markets.
The real VPS come from wheat.  It doesn’t matter if you have a lot of cities if you lack wheat to feed them and even worse to increase their population.

Aunque tiene un reglamento que deja algo que desear por la forma en que está escrito, Polis te sumerge en una especie de gestión de recursos/wargame donde tendrás que compensar el crecimiento demográfico con la expansión militar. Tener que alimentar a la población a la vez que recibes suministros para crear tropas y proyectos obliga a planificar la estrategia. ¿Jugaré a dejar a la otra liga fuera de combate en la fase 4 o esperaré para lanzar una guerra total en las fases 5a y 5b?
Al final todo se decide en la última ronda, con batallas y asedios por toda Grecia.

An excellent Euro-wargame.  There is a wargame here, I'm sure of it, but it feels like a violent fight for resources.  The economic elements of this game brilliantly offset the military aspects.  While luck of the die can make this game irritating, there's no reason to rely on it.  The cards can also be a bit irritating, but much less so, and it is a wargame after all.  Verdict: the die can be mitigated in several ways and the luck of the cards isn't too bad.  A brilliant economic wargame.

Es un euro con mucho sabor a wargame. Se juega en cuatro rondas.. y en cada ronda se van alternando los jugadores ejecutando dos acciones cada vez un número indeterminado de turnos. Cuando ambos pasan se avanza a la sigueinte ronda. Gana quien más puntos de victoria consigue al final de la cuarta ronda calculados sumando puntos de prestigio, poblacion de las polis que domines y puntos de prestigio por proyectos finalizados.
Exiten doce posibles acciones, divididas en tres categorías (Desarrollo, militar y políticas). Es sólo para dos jugadores. Creo que es muy buen juego, aunque sospecho que hay que jugarlo mucho para sacarle todo su jugo.

Many interesting ideas. Trading, diplomacy, battle...seems to have it all. Still, once you´ve fallen behind, it´s over. There´s no way to come back. And this can happen right in the first turn. One or two lucky or unlucky roles can decide the game. From then on, the weaker player has less and less options, while the better player just runs away. For me, this destroys every game, no matter how good it is.

I have never ever been so overwhelmed by ressource management.

First round: "Ok, I have something of everthing. Looks like I can work with that."

Second round: "That was a good round. So what am I going to do now? Wait. I don't have ressources. What?!? Crap, how do I get everything that I need? Oh oh..."

Many interesting things here but at the end everything seems to be boiled down to who draws the best cards in the combats: ambush, mercenaries, peltasts, archers, etc. What's the strategy here? Just play the less common cards and pray.

Surely I haven't played enough games but I found too randomness: combat cards and besige rolls, which are too important on this game.

great euro wargame. the logistical decisions can be very challenging and poor planning can leave you without a key resource.   the seige mechanic can screw you so i sort of wish this was modified. though the resource management can get fiddly, most things are simplified without too many nitpicky rules and exceptions.  the battle system is rather too simplistic for my tastes but it generally works even if the luck aspect can be irritating.  nice components!

This is a tentative rating until I've played the game a few more times, but I have to say that I really like Polis as a Euroey wargame or wargamey Euro or whatever, a genre that I'm not always all that enthusiastic about. I know next to nothing about the history of the conflict, but Polis seems to work fairly well as a thumbnail sketch of what was going on in the Poleis and gives the player several different ways win. Much more thematically coherent than I've come to expect from most eurogames. Really, I am amazed at how well this thing works as both a game and a broad overview of how the conflict worked and/or played itself out. 

Things to remember:

Grab cities in areas that produce stuff you will need. 

Don't be overly aggressive. It's really easy to overextend yourself. 

Athens should look for early sea-dominace and maintain it?

Don't neglect trading as a viable option.

Battles are chancey, and will probably work better as a threat than in delivering actual results. If your overall game is hanging on winning any given battle, you've probably already lost. 

More to come....

A two-player only civ game. The first play was clearly a learning play, as you have to learn how to balance resources, prestige, and military actions. I clearly didn't, and handcuffed myself with no ability to really expand or gain resources.

Still...

There's some things I really liked about the game, and I'm curious to try again to see if more knowledge about the game leads to smarter and more enjoyable play on my part.

Enjoyable game. Like most games covering these wars, it is a wide open, dynamic affair. This one has a big focus on resource management. In fact, it is what drives the game. But combats are bloody and volatile and are critical inflection points.

Clever game that works its dime-store Thucydides theme in smart ways. Overstuffed with things to do (teaching the game is a bit of a slog, especially if the rules are not on the tip of your tongue) but actually quite pacey once you get started. More like a Euro with a few stray wargamish elements than a true wargame-Euro hybrid.

People talk about games being tough and unforgiving, and when they do they're usually talking about a game that gives their opponent(s) the opportunity to pull off a devastating and/or cruel move against them; Polis is this.

But Polis is also a game where the rules themselves, the game itself as a system, is just poised to punch you straight in the mouth if you don't think through every move up to and including the opening two. It's a smooth, innovative and interesting system but the extent to which you will want to revisit it is directly proportional to the extent to which you are motivated by phrases like "I want to hurt this the way it hurt me."

I grasp the rules but I cannot truly get a grip on the strategy, not yet. But I guess I'm encouraged by the realization that I want to hurt this the way it hurt me.

Polis is an asymmetric 2p [b]civ-light[/b], [b]economic[/b], [b]resource management[/b], [b]war game[/b] hybrid. This game will appeal to anyone who appreciates an in-depth experience in any of these genres. [b]Area control/influence [/b] and strategic [b]area movement[/b] on the map are key to having access (or to prevent access) to the resources required to build your engine and to grow your civilisation. 

A 4 sided die is used [b](dice rolling)[/b] to determine resource market values of the goods and if Polis besieging attempts are successful, which incorporates a small element of [b]luck[/b] (that can easily be mitigated and planned for).  

Battles are resolved by [b]card drafting[/b] from the Battle deck, then playing cards against each other in hopes to either eliminate the defending player's units and/or earn prestige.

Take the fire alarm out of your game's room because it will go off - your brain will be burning…but in a good way! Fantastic Game!

Tight and open ended resource management conflict simulation. Could easily have been designed by Martin Wallace, a wonderful and elegant system that works very well. Requires many plays to understand the interlocking systems, and even more to start formulating a strategy.

The rulebook is imprecise, but the geek has this covered. Excellent game for gamers that do not shy from conflict. Keeper.

RATING: 3
I cannot really remember what triggered my interest in Polis. Probably the beautiful map of the first edition which invites playing like nothing else. There was, I think, also talk of it being a weuro / waro / hybrid, but then for just 2 players. Back in the days I was still quite sensitive for that sort of thing, and it was only the very long explanation at the Spiel booth that stayed my hand: my partner was simply not up to absorbing those rules on a regular basis. But the attraction persisted, and when the German reprint went on sale two years later, I brought home a copy figuring that at the price it was going for it was worth a shot.

I found the rules to be elaborate, but not undoable. Explaining them takes time, though; and although they aren't that difficult in practice there's still a lot of stuff to remember. What I [i]hadn't[/i] counted on was the glacial pace of the game despite all the 'cool' actions; and that in fact Polis is a game of [i]three[/i] rather than two players: the game itself is as much an opponent of the players. Literally [i]everything[/i] you can think of to make some progress is curtailed by the game. Lots of military actions? Cost prestige, and no prestige means no fun. Have the prestige but now need the cannon fodder? Comes right out of your population which grows very, very sparingly. Oh, you need more grain for this? Well, first you need trade vessels (costing wood and population), then you need tradeable goods (requiring cannon fodder and costing prestige) and then you get a [i]tiny[/i] amount of grain. Which is first used to feed the population, then grows the cities, and then spoils by 50% rounding in your disfavour. ([i]Excuse me, favour, that's an erratum. Not that it matters much.[/i]) And if you've got lots of military power, chances are that you won't have enough population in your supply to grow the cities much. Combat? A complex and semi-random procedure with battle cards which could easily have been replaced by a roll on a CRT; and because combat is difficult to start (chalk it up to the game again) the amount of randomness essentially dominates matters here. Curiously enough, because of the cube shortages in your supply you may at times even play to lose here: a gimmicky and gamey mechanism. Taking over cities? Roll a die, and pay prestige. With any luck you end up with more prestige than you started out with. And without a city, you cannot tax surrounding areas (costing prestige again), and thus cannot obtain grain. Market? Prices are adjusted on the basis of 1D4 or max(2D4). The list of bars and stop-signs is endless.

I suppose that some people find this sort of pushback fun, that you need to keep going because at some point luck is with you and you manage to take over a few key areas, thus awarding you with much-needed breathing and manoeuvring room until the next dearth of options. But I find it grating boredom, especially since the game takes as long as it does. The BGG entry mentions at the time of writing 90 to 120 minutes... well, I suppose that if you are forced to play the Salpinx card without prestige that the game can be cut short unexpectedly. Likewise rounds ought not to be played until you [i]really[/i] can do no more, because you don't get any resources for the next round, and are likely to flap around like a fish on the shore. So perhaps there is some truth in the playing time, but at a price: the game [i]again[/i] dictating how it wants to be played. Now of course all games are guilty of this, but in Polis the ratio of directives versus your own options is very, very off, especially considering the game's nature.

At the heart of this issue is simply a difference in design philosophy. Were I to create a game, I'd go for an open-ended system where players can do mostly whatever they like. Polis is the opposite. It's a tightly guarded and controlled ecosystem where players are leashed and brought to heel at nearly every convenience. This isn't really the [i]railroading[/i] I spoke of in earlier versions of this comment because the game doesn't really tell you what to do. On the other hand it [i]does[/i] tell you what you can't, again and again and again, leaving you with no option but to proceed where it doesn't curtail you. In this it resembles a game which game out a few years later, AquaSphere, which is just as much an iron maiden with a with nails left out to allow for [i]some[/i] wriggle room without, overtly, being railroaded.

All in all this game is going to be let go: it's too much fighting over scraps and too little about going your own way. It's too bad, really, as the idea of a strong 2P weuro / waro [i]does[/i] have merits. But when they're given shape like this, I'm going to pass and move on to something else.

This game is one of the better games I know of which have simple mechanism, but many tough choices.  The first play was quite different than we expected, in that there was less direct conflict between our Hoplites, and more careful resource management.  The first round certainly had interaction as you denied opportunity to your opponent with your choices, but the last round we found less interaction and most focus going towards just holding our empires together; in fact we both ran out of influence in the last round which prevented us from doing all we would have liked.  Definitely like the historical links of this game and want to get some more plays in.

unfortunately, they totally ruined this game by changing rules on siege and normal fights... siege now is totally random and this has a very heavy impact on game. My impression is that they changed this rules without really any playtest at all. In my humble opinion the game should be replanned on less rounds (3 or 2), with combat based on bluff like on previous version of the game (or, for example like in dungeon twister) and a siege without rolling any die (for example losing automatically 1 cube but succeding, or losing as many prestige as half the defense value of the polis..) All other things works pretty well, I'm convinced that this game can be "saved" to become a really good game, but so far, it deserves a 5/10 (my evaluation is based on previous set of rules...)

Not quite what I expected as far as a war-game goes. This one is very Euro-y, and seems to put too much emphasis on restrictions and scarcity (actions/resources/military). While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it results in a fragile game that can be easily won or lost in the first turn. A good design, but one that doesn't feel "fun" to me.

Brutal game! We were so busy trying not to lose cities through starvation that we never actually had a battle (although there were a couple of sieges in the last round). We sat down to play immediately upon popping the shrinkwrap, though, so we had no idea what to do up front and probably put ourselves in that hole.

I won as Sparta by building lots of statues and temples, while my Athenian opponent rampaged across the map conquering neutral cities. Go figure!

The key takeaway from my first play is that both players enjoyed the game more and more as it progressed and its subtleties became clear. It'll definitely hit the table again soon, at which time I'll rate it. This could be a strong 9.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A few plays in now, initial impressions are good. Solid mechanics, lots of choices, and tough decisions to make. You have to balance conquering cities versus the cost to feed their population. The battle system is reminiscent of Hannibal: Rome vs Carthage, but it's simpler, faster, and ties in the concept of prestige to boot. The market system is reasonable, and is an interesting element unto itself.

The game has taken some minor flak for the siege rules, but here I think you're supposed to force the issue with your Proxenos rather than repeatedly beat your head into a wall if things don't go well. That, or play with any one of the many proposed variants to suit your needs. Also, the rules that shipped with the game aren't good, but the designer has posted an updated version here that's much better.

Anyway, thumbs up.

Update: Had to drop my rating. Too many games boiling down to a single bad beat in a battle where one guy draws nothing but Phalanxes and the other poor slob can't match. And it's usually Sparta beating Athens. Beyond that, though, it's just too difficult to get to the table. The problem is that it's not very suitable for the euro crowd since it's only 2p and a bit long, and not suitable for the wargamer crowd who don't find it deep enough. The effective result is that none of my gamer buddies really want to play it.

Plus, I just don't think the balance is there. Short of bad luck and/or bad play, Sparta should win most games.

Traded.

Totally unfair, provisional rating, unfair because this is only based on one play. This is a pretty elegant game and I love how you have to basically cash in your victory points (population or prestige) to do anything. Lots of depth to be uncovered here. Pretty baffling initially, not in terms of rules, but in terms of the depth of the game. This is not a game that eases you in, but one that tosses you into the deep end and expects you to learn how to swim.

Players represent Athens or Sparta, and refight the Peloponnesian War.  Tight, tense two player game where players alternate taking two actions, from a choice of twelve, to further their cause.  Actions are roughly divided into construction (build an army, fleet, merchants, projects), warfare (go fight stuff), and politics (trade, or stir up unrest with your devilish ambassador).  The object is to expand your empire, grow your economy, keep the people fed, and the cities topped up.  Your final score is your prestige plus city population, but you need to spend both these things to raise armies and go to war.   What a dilemma.  Very early days, but this game is stunning.  Possibly the perfect hybrid Euro/wargame.

RATING: 8
Very interesting, very intense game experience. Not sure what type of game this is (someone suggested the term "Weuro", a combination of wargame and euro), being neither a straight resource management, wargame or others.
The rules could use a good copy editing/trimming, having been obviously not been written by an English speaker, although the intentions are clear in general. Some of the details or reason for some rules aren't obvious at first, but when the game is played, you understand quickly why the choices were made.
Very comparable to a two player Wallace title, with the first few turns being uncertain for the players, trying to see what needs to be done to get the all important Prestige points. As the game progresses, strategies and understanding will dawn. 
Very good game, needs to be played again soon.

This is one of my top 2 player games ever. Completely engrossing and ridiculously unapologetic in it's difficulty. You WILL mess up repeatedly, leading to your civilization grinding to a halt as you spend turn after turn trying to recover from badly managed resources. 

However a time eventually comes when the mechanics completely click, and it is so worth the wait. The Athenians playing to their strengths of political influence, bribery, trading and naval conflict. The Spartans waging war across the land, capturing territory and taking their populace for every resource they are worth. 

This game is a masterpiece that will leave you thinking about it for hours afterwards.

More impressed than i was expecting to be. This game mechanically reminds me of Tresham's 1980 Civ with its population growth and food demand mechanics and area control. The game flows nicely and is very well produced. From a historical perspective it does well for a euro i guess. Many of the historical events/characters are retired to an event deck that isn't used that much in the game. Much of the history comes from the map geography. Athens will be in trouble if they lose the Cyclades/Aegean, and Syracuse is actually worth attacking (for both sides though).

A fantastically constructed game, with intriguing and tense game play. Fascinating to play, even if it is a lot to take into account, and not easy to not overlook anything.
I would have ranked it a 10, but the influence of the die in the Besieging action is too big, as the roll of one die can swing the game. It is easily houseruled (which I did), which I think a 9 is valid...

Interesting mix of Euro and wargame features with a very manageable set of rules. I particularly like how the game restricts player actions by having to pay in prestige for all actions potentially detrimental to your neighbours or subjects (like moving troops, imposing taxes, etc.). Expanding your empire and keeping your populace happy are quite challenging that way.

On the other hand, the siege rolls really bother me. They are a very prominent and fairly regularly used feature that can have extraordinary strong effects on the game (most especially when the besieger gets lucky).

I purchased this in 2014 and have been able to play it once. I love its execution on its theme. Players immediately grasp how central trade is to the game. So far I don't like the battles very much but it's much more interesting than my other game on this subject: Perikles. I also don't like that dice are used to resolve sieges, but as in Twilight Struggle managing that risk is doable. Teaching all 12 actions in the game is also a little difficult. 

I can't wait to play this again. The way movement and blockading works is very elegant and fun. This might replace Twilight Struggle for me.

Eine echte Kante als abendfüllender, taktischer Dauer-Positionskampf von Angesicht zu Angesicht, der Sitzfleisch und Nerven abverlangt. Dabei kann der Glücksfaktor in Form eines pyramidischen Würfels und der Schlachtkarten erheblich sein. Alternativ muss man Poleis mit dem Proxenos einnehmen und auf Kämpfe verzichten. Im Angesicht dieses Glücksfaktors und der brutalen Spielzeit sollten Strategen, die alles im Griff haben wollen, einen grossen Pfeil- und Bogen um die antike Ägäis machen.

Rating Polis has been one of the more difficult ratings for me. Clearly, it is a solid game based on the number of people who enjoy it.  What they see in it is what I saw in it: a very opaque Euro/civ hybrid that crushes its players with constant scarcity and a struggle to survive. The question is whether or not you find this feeling enjoyable.  For those who love the game, they got it right: they struggled like everyone else with their first game and continued to play games until certain strategies started working. From their reports, they love the puzzle that Polis provides and how it creates a situation where you are balancing on a thread the whole time between you and your opponent, attempting to come out on top.  For me, I just didn't get the feeling from my first play like I wanted to explore the game for a second time. Unfortunately, I was immediately put off by the rules. They were poorly written, taking quite straightforward mechanics and obfuscating them with clunky sentences and poor organization.  They did nothing to assist the player with getting a broad sense of what the game was about and how to proceed.  After reading the rules, I sat there for my first move, pretty much frozen in a feeling of unknowing.  Again- this isn't a rare experience for first timers and even for first timers who have grown to love the game.  But I slowly worked through each action, trying things out, suffering the whole time (along with my opponent).  The winner was the player who suffered less a shade than their opponent.  With every round, by the time I had food figured out, I was drained of any momentum to do anything else. And frankly I found the actions were incredibly boring and quite abstracted from the theme, more so than I think the designer (and even some of the fans) believe them to be.  The whole game just felt perfunctory for the first time.  And once again: this isn't a rare experience for first timers.  Which is why I rated this game higher than I usually would for a game I didn't enjoy for the most part.  It has a solid structure of a good game, but a bad rulebook and a lack of any attempt to make the game coherent for first-time players.  This simply didn't work for me and probably soured my experience more than it should have.  This doesn't mean you might not enjoy it.  You might enjoy the puzzle.  Frankly, games that attempt to create tension through all-out scarcity don't thrill me.  Repeated plays will have you doing better each time, so the question is- what kind of games do you want to be spending your time playing?

RATING: 8
Wow - one of the best Euro / War Game Hybrids I've played.  Firstly, It definitely has the two things I like most in a game: strategy and explosiveness.  Secondly, this is a fine example of how well design-for-effect can work.  A satisfying number of options are presented each round as the players alternate taking two actions each.  Turns are fast.  The mechanics of each action are simple and the rules intuitive. Doing what you need to do before your opponent makes it more difficult, risky and/or costly create a delicious tension that is absorbing and delightful.  The game length is easily justified by the truly strategic options available - you get to watch your plan unfold as the hours flash by. One player can run away with it, but this is not uncommon in war games.  With a max player count of 2, the player who is unrecoverably behind simply resigns, sot it's not really a "problem".

This is one hell of a game.  One game so far as the Spartans - a 27-12 loss.  I didn't leave myself enough ways to gain resources each round and it resulted in two highly unproductive last two rounds.  The rules are not complex, but the gameplay is very deep.

Another loss as Spartans, 25-21. This game had five or six battles as we both tried to get more prestige in order to complete more actions. 

I love this game, but what's with the die???

After three plays (each with a bunch of rules mistakes), I love it.  I've got it down to about half the time the first game took.  I can see this playing in under an hour with two experienced players.  The die still drives me nuts, and I know there are diceless siege variants, but what the hell - it may not roll well, but I can live with it.  This is just about a 10 for me.

Good euro light wargame although gathering resourcses and VP conversion is the main focus. Combat uses a hidden auction mechanic (both sides play a card and compare "rock-paper-scissors" style) which is not my favourite mechanism in any game and sieges are resolved on a dice roll so the outcome is quite random and the consequences of failure are very high - both negatives in a game where resouces are very tight and a random setback can be devastating. But overall a good interactive Euro!

All the bits are very good.

Interesting and very strategic game. 

It has manoeuvre, war, commerce and civilization like choices. A heap of stuff to think about. 

That amounts for a steep learning curve, but I think it is a neat little game with absolutely gorgeous components that plays in a reasonable time. 

UPDATE
Ok this has gone up. Since the VASSAL module for it is going to be available, this is going to be a sure keeper. 

UPDATE
Re-played this recently. It really is a good game. For now if Athens has a free reign in the sea, Sparta is dead. Therefore no superpower can be allowed to have complete control in any strategic sector. Just how I like it. :) In other words FANTASTIC GAME worth having and keeping. 

UPDATE
Was finally able to play Sparta. By 5a I was nearly wiped out from the seas and the Athenians were slowly strangling me, BUT Athens had been utterly wiped out on the mainland, so Sparta had free reign, also Athens had no way to create more hoplites, therefore the game was practically in Spartan hands. 

Interesting. This game continues getting better with each game I play. 

UPDATE
I'm trying my hand at the scenarios and I must say they are pretty interesting, especially because early mishaps won't kill you! :D This remains a tremendous, unforgiving game, worth having in one's collection.

Fantastic game. I know its abstracted history but a lot of attention clearly went into giving it flow and feel appropriate to its historical subject.

Polis is one of those games that is difficult to categorize. At once, it is a Euro resource acquisition/conversion game with an Agricola-esque food angst while simultaneously being (light) War game with its maneuvering, combat, blockades, and pillage. 

The game is one of brinksmanship. Not only because almost every action that builds towards gaining more prestige also cost you prestige, but your polis (i.e., cities) are vulnerable to being overtaken (and your hard-laboured projects stolen from you), your armies (which claim resources) run down, or your escape routes blocked off. This game exceptionally fits the oft-used moniker of "knife-fight-in-a-phone-booth."

The asymmetry is also beautiful here as it requires both sides to play radically differently -- Sparta with its straight forward beat-down and Athens playing a more devious political and route (trade, naval, and, as best it can, land) controlling game. This is done without the need of additional rules either -- the asymmetry is built right into the initial board positioning as well as the one major differentiation between the two sides: who gets to make the first swing on land (Sparta) and at sea (Athens). 

With your two actions per turn, you can't cover all of your bases -- yet you still need to apply and/or respond to so much pressure -- this is a feature I often appreciate of games. Even the micro-economy is nicely realized as well as a means of applying small increments of pressure via supply and demand, potentially cutting a player out of a trade! The small amounts of variability and randomness breath a lot of life into the tension here as well -- nothing is a sure bet: conquering polis requires rolling a D4, battles require matching symbols (a la Hannibal), and an event card can give you or take away that micro-advantage you so desperately need.

Lastly, the game is beautiful with its pared down yet colourful aesthetics. Mercury did a great job with the production on this.

Way too euroy (all those ressources) & not enough war-ish for my taste.. asa a game uses simple cubes to represent armies or ships instead of counters or models i'm out.
That might placate a euro-gamer to play a game about conflict but it's too much of an abstraction/reduction in my view to feel any kind of excitement playing the thing.

RATING: 5
Too long for the amount of randomness of just a few rolls -- don't believe the quoted 90 minutes (card combat is also quite random). More like double that. 

A lot of running around to levy taxes is probably just wasted motion -- could have saved time by just instituting a single income phase. Ironic that while you have to run your troops around to collect taxes, once they are levied they just show up exactly where you need them as if by magic. 

Athens appears to have the advantage with its Anaconda strategy (American Civil War reference).

Only played 2 games.  Not sure how much variability there will be between games so I'll have to play more to find out.  I wish more than 4 events happened during a game.

After the 3rd game with Sparta winning every game the imbalance (of Sparta's land strength) is starting to annoy me.

I'll give it one more go.

I had high expectations with Polis... and amazingly they have been met!

Polis is an eurogame, that mix different mechanics (since area control to economic issues). 

I love that the victory points (population + prestige) are at the same time resources that you need to fight the other player; that forces you to a constant search of equilibrium. You can't expand too much, but you can't either stay quiet while the other player moves his hoplites. 

Great game!

Polis is a stunning design that combines economic and military strategic planning, while remaining playable in a reasonable amount of time (~2 hours). The core of the game is gaining and maintaining prestige. The problem is that you also have to feed your population, and in order to do that (and to generally expand your empire), you'll have to do some military operations, which all cost prestige to use. The only way to really gain any significant amount of prestige is by winning battles, so you'll have to be aggressive against your opponent. In the end, you're faced with a very difficult balancing act where you never feel like you can really do what you need to do.

The game is tough, unforgiving, yet fun. It defies categorization: it's not like any euro game, it's not like any wargame, and it definitely doesn't feel ameritrashy at all. Thus, I can't recommend it on any of those grounds. Basically, if you enjoy difficult, "think-y" strategy games, and you don't mind aggression and attacking in your games, then this is for you. Buy it now.

After 6 plays I have revised the score to the maximum. I may change it in the future, but so far this this hybrid between resource management and strategic combat is the most fascinating game I have played in a long time (ever?). It is unforgiving and it has a very steep learning curve, but the sensations the game leaves and the strategic possibilities are such that you won't be able to take it out of your head. I found the asynchronous turn base experience on board game arena a perfect way to learn the game. Moreover the quality of the components for the new second edition makes you want to own it even if you just play online. 
In sum, if you want a deep strategic game and feel like an ancient Greek General this is a must. This game should be ranked near TS. 
Edit: after 10 plays I confirm my top score for this game

I love the 'euro'-ness of this game sprinkled with a little war gaming. 

I have yet to play in person, but have about 15 games under my belt on BGA. I have barely scratched the strategic surface of this game and I love that. It can be very chess-like in that one mistake against a veteran opponent can ruin your game, but with multiple plays, you get the chance to learn from them. And there seem to be so many different strategies to uncover and pursue. I thought at the beginning - and still do - that it's a game best learned by two players at the same time, though obviously I'm a little past that.

The battle mechanism satisfies me because it's not dice. The way the cards work, showing how many cards of a type are in the deck, allows you to make educated decisions on which to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Excellent game!  Polis is a tense two-player waro (war-euro).  Every decision feels meaningful, and taking actions in the correct order absolutely matters.  The way in which the different mechanisms combine makes for a tightly-interlocking game where each action you take can open up more actions for your next round of play.  After a handful of plays there seem to be a number of viable strategies, though it seems like standard Spartan openings are going to become the norm.  There's nothing wrong with that!

Athens may seem a bit weaker than Sparta, since naval battles don't happen anywhere near as often as land battles, but control of the seas and the power that comes from that is a subtle but strong advantage.  I look forward to more plays, and my rating my go up with time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Polis offers a unique blend of everything I look for in a game: a vast decision space, meaningful interaction, resource management, advanced planning, long-range strategy, situational tactics, etc. Excellent theme that is implemented well, and the attention to detail and historical accuracy of this game take the design to a level far above the norm. It is admittedly a fairly dense game that requires a thorough knowledge of the rules to play well and enjoy; which means you also need a dedicated partner or group of friends who are willing to learn this at the same level. Those minor caveats aside, this game is a remarkable contribution to the hobby.

Auch, my brain hurts! So much going on and almost too many actions and too many resources to keep track of. Would be nicer with some galley pieces, I kept picking them up as if they where hoplites. But it worked very well and you really have to strategize to do well. Battle system was a little random yes, but also fast and fluint. Event cards was better than I had thought, added some flavor to the rounds. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A highly-constrained 2-player resource management and slug-fest. The cost to do most things is very high in this one, so every decision is a big one. Combat is inevitable, but plays less of a role in the outcome than you may at first think. This is the very definition of a weuro (wargame/eurogame cross-breed).

I feel as if I like this game more in theory than in fact. I look at the objectives and the game play and I think "I'll love this.", but then I play it and feel frustrated most of the game by what I can't do or fail to accomplish. It might be the uncertain prospects of success (dice rolls) in some of your basic actions that rubs me the wrong way. I really like constraints in games, but not so much when they are an all or nothing affair. I like being forced to make a sub-optimal choice, but not going home entirely empty-handed. Makes me feel like I wasted a turn or action through no fault of my own.

I don't think this is a flaw of the game, but a matter of taste. I do think this is a very well-designed game that I can appreciate, but there are other things I'd rather be playing.

Brilliant design that encourages players to think about more than just the military operations. Capturing cities is simply not enough. The economic infrastructure to support cities is required. Spartan hoplites might be able to subsist on gristle and olive pits. But your smiths and merchants can't. Of course, that only matters if you want armour and weapons.  

Had the rulebook been clearer then it would have had gotten a '10', methinks.

Polis is a wargame with a 'euro' resource management system. While I can understand its high rating due to its uniqueness it's just ok for me. My main gripe is with the high stake siege rolls that are too decisive and too rare to balance out over the course of a game. Additionally, I didn't like how it played out as a slugfest but that might have been due to a fatal strategy of waging a land war as Athens against Sparta for Korinth. That stretched the playing time beyond the acceptable.
Nonetheless, I give it the benefit of doubt with my rating of 7 as the resource management part is well done and gives enough food for thought unless the game gets stalled in endless battles.

Terrific game that captures the epic sweep of the Pelopponesian War in all its dimensions, yet is playable in a short evening.  The decision-making feels right for the level the player represents, as he directs trade, diplomatic efforts, taxation, and the military.  Some subsystems feel a little involved but only relative to the smoothness of the overall design.  Native English speakers, don't be put off by the rulebook translation - it's quirky but complete, with a charm all its own.  Highly recommended.

*All Comments Based on Solo Play*

I like the way the game harnesses eurogame economic management with area control wargame ideas to serve a thematic, ALMOST simulative purpose. It does a good job of illustrating the reasons for strategic conflict. Even when the abstractions are more salient than the representation it somehow continues to feel more narrative than gamey, and the results seem to follow historical lines. I found the gameplay to be both light and quick while showing hints at deeper strategies. Would the breadth of strategy exist without the randomizing elements? Would the game be better without them? It sort of feels like this game is seminal and that these ideas could be crytalized a bit further into something classic. I think this game will reward many plays despite or maybe because of it's quirks.

Has the elusive balance of a managable size and scope with a strong sense of development and meaningful progression.

Works well solo. Even with the combat cards.

This is a tightly wound two player game where you need to manage the resources very carefully.  Going off to war can be a painful decision and must be carefully done at specific moments when you need to deny an opponent a key location or access to the seas.  Battle casualties will set you back in establishing and strengthening your economy.  There are 12 possible actions of which you do two every turn until you pass and only four total rounds to the game.  One needs to consider which polis' to besiege and take over to obtain the necessary resources or deny your opponent the same.  

Expect the first game to be frustrating and an exercise in futility if battles are a priority...use your hoplites to build an infrastructure first if possible.  I'm not sure how I feel about the randomness of the die roll for besieging cities...particularly ones that are of value 4 considering the lack of rolls potentially evening out over the course of the game.  That would be my biggest source of irritation for the game as there is no method to modify those die rolls.

[b]Polis presents a highly replayable, unique and outstanding economic war game experience.[/b]
r{[i]This asymmetrical two-player competition for resources, territory, population and ultimately prestige marries a beautifully illustrated ancient Greek theme with tension-filled, decision making opportunities every turn to produce a very satisfying finish, win or lose.[/i]}r

SYNOPSIS
Polis combines a light war game with a tight economic struggle. Sparta and Athens take turns building rival civilizations by expanding their reach and influence among ancient Greek city-states. Territorial expansion through warfare or diplomatic skill is balanced against the need to sustain a growing populace through efficient resource collection and trade. Prestige accumulated throughout the game is particularly precious as it must be spent enforcing military actions while also counting in combination with final population totals towards determining victory.

COMMENTS
This game demands well thought out strategic planning but also rewards midgame tactical play, taking advantage of the few random elements which can prove disruptive at times. Games typically last 2-3+ hours but are so highly engaging I hardly notice how long it takes to finish play. Every game leaves me thinking about my experience the following day; considering my moves and mistakes, imagining all the 'what if' scenarios that could have gone a different way and planning on ways to improve the next time. This game fills me with the excitement I felt when playing Puerto Rico for the first time and discovering the world of German-style board games which is high praise indeed.

Polis is infused throughout with historical references to support its theme. Much like Sekigahara: The Unification of Japan, Polis references its inspirations by basing each side's strengths and weaknesses broadly to their namesakes and by designing elements of game play which suggest certain strategies aligned to historical precedents. It's not immersive per se but rather reflective of the struggle between those two great neighboring civilizations.

PROS+, CONS- & NOTES*
+ Depth of open decision space allows for varied direct and/or indirect conflict.
+ Limitation of turn sequences inspires chess-like puzzle solving strategies to accomplish tasks.
+ Subtle advantages represent the theme well.
+ Historical event cards add thematic action to game play.
+ Included alternate scenarios allow for quicker play.
- Management of scarce resources can be unforgiving.
- Battles determined by card game and sieges by four-sided die rolls considered too random/luck-filled for some.
- Some aspects of game seem unintuitive, especially compared to other war games, e.g. moving and fighting forces.
- Hard for beginners to understand what to do initially and how to play effectively until more familiar and experienced with the game.
* Rule book includes many good illustrative examples of rules and play, but earlier version was poorly translated.
* Simple abstraction of population and combat units uses same cubes to represent both.

I knocked this down from a 9. I don't know if this was planned (I assume so) but as Athens, if the game goes to the final round, there's really not much you can do to win. Sparta can take over all territories and gain prestige pretty much at will.

Other than that, it's a great game with simple rules and interesting decisions.

An instant favorite, even though it is about as forgiving as a dwarf's book of grudges.  

At first glance it seems to be an Euro-area-control-war-game hybrid.  The rules do a great job of forcing a balance between the this-for-that-resource-management and the maneuvering and use of cubes/forces.  This is a game that definitely rewards repeated play.

WOW! Just discovered this game. It was totally a spontaneous buy, but something about it was intriguing. That 2 hour+ how to play video is daunting. It's actually easier to just learn the first game from the rulebook. It's actually really easy. Asymmetrical play, tight resource availability, very interesting decisions, and a combat system that is just wonderful. If there is any drawback at all to this game it's that it can't be shared with more than one other person at a time. There needs to be a 2-4 player version!!

First impression after playing just a few times online.  This is a very thematic, interesting, challenging, evocative, beautiful duel.  Every misstep can and will cost you the match.  The challenge in the first games is not to show who has the most brawn, but who can feed his people while maintaining enough prestige to avoid being ostracized.  Intelligent restraint and careful gambles are required before you can shout "This Is Sparta" or smugly assert Athens' intellectual superiority.  What a wonderful game.

A current favorite, in part because I'm still figuring this one out. Wargame with resource-tight Euro economy. Both aspects support each other and combine into a sweet brain-burner. Keeps you on your toes and can be punishing if you're not careful.

A very ambitious game that tries to compress the whole Peloponnesian War into only a few turns.  On the way it unfortunately constrains play so much that while it takes on an interesting puzzle character, often doing little is best and on can't do much anyway.  

In a way the nature of this game seems similar to that of High Frontier (which means similar to balancing a meatball on the tip of a slightly wet spaghetti). The difference appears to be that Polis is *less* forgiving than High Frontier. (Sort of like High Frontier with a single rocket launch per player.)  It is a quite tense game and the brain burner aspects are impressive but seem to leave you frequently with little to do but pass and watch the wheat grow. So while it is interesting to see what happens, I end up being slightly bored much of the time.

It does join the hallowed ranks of the "this is not a wargame" wargames (such as After the Holocaust or King of Kings), although the brush is very broad. This decade we invest in olive oil while building armaments with the metal mined in the previous decade because switching whole sectors of the economy on and off is more effective; maintaining population is tough which is ok but maintaining standing armies is for free which is just weird.  I haven't checked but do the "projects" all belong to the historical Peloponnesian War period?  Because clearly only a fraction of them will ever see the light of day in any one game. In fact I suspect that the game would make for a decent historical representation of yearly turns if maintaining armies was more expensive and moving them cheaper.

Would be interesting to see a game played by two grand masters to see what level of activity they would wring from the engine.  On the whole though, I think King of Kings is more fun.

A really interesting game where it feels like the game is actively fighting against you and it's very easy to paint yourself into a corner! There are loads of options, perhaps more than I would usually like, but it does make the game feel very wide open, and your options non-obvious. 

I felt a bit overwhelmed during my first game, but as it went along the options became clearer... the strategy still feels opaque to me, though! There's definitely a lot more to chew on that what I've already taken a bit of.

11/22/14 Played what I assume was the campaign game in 3.5 hours, losing badly with Athens, using the just released Mercury Games (2nd?) edition.
-  Polis is a Euro/war game fusion. The box says 90-120 minutes. Pffft! I didn't read the rules but the owner said even this "improved" second edition suffers from what is most likely a poor translation. He mentioned the same items being called different things in different places; which is not conducive to grasping the game. What I did note was some of the things listed on the player boards as actions/phases could have been worded better. As is several were somewhat poor choices, obscuring the actual meaning. Examples: "Collection" instead of taxation, "Goods adjustment" instead of spoilage, "Phoros" an end of round activity where I *think* you could exchange prestige points for silver or maybe visa versa. 
-  Polis is a game where you can NOT expect to do well, or even passable your first (or second) game. There are just too many moving parts, options, and resource tightness. As to the components, they were very nice, except the cards (and these are the "improved" second edition ones) are rather thin. 
- Its a game like Le Havre, where you have extreme resource scarcity. And therefore you spend 90% of your efforts "fighting the game system" instead of your opponent. Hence a limited amount of battles. The game is definitely a brain burner. 
-  I'm glad I got to play it, and look forward to butting heads with it again. Though right now I'm glad I wasn't the one who had to buy it (and decipher the rules); something I'd seriously considered before today.

This is a potentially incredible game, but it has a few mechanisms which I find to be a bit aggravating despite the fact that similar mechanisms don't bother me in other games which I enjoy quite a bit.  


Basically this is a big old logistics game, with a wide set of interrelated decisions to be made (GREAT!). The theme is integrated at times, but basically arbitrary, though I like it enough, who doesn't like ancient Greece? The level of player interaction is defined by the players, which is fine.  So on paper this is working for me thus far.  And as you learn the game more and more, you realize that the scope is pretty cool, the different ways that different resources can be traded with other resources in order to ultimately make the final resources that you want, which can actually be acquired in two places, the population of your overall ruled area and your "prestige" aka VPs.

So, problems are: 

1. The dice roll on the besiege move already costs a prestige to try, and then can cost you more by failing, and as your faction improves there is little that can be done to increase your likelihood of winning the besiege, the odds are the odds from the beginning.  Luck with no mitigation is meh.  

2. Luck in the battle card mechanism. Since you are drawing at every battle, there is no way to improve your chances once the battle begins, or in advance of it really aside from timing the battle yourself so you can have a numbers advantage.  There is *some* tactical skill in the card play, but basically its luck, some memory and some statistical optimization, but you can't improve your army or really mitigate the downside of battle.

3. The project chit pull can be more or less advantageous depending on what gets pulled in the first round especially, though obviously this isn't super problematic, and probably comes out in the wash.

Ultimately, I think that the superior strategic play wins this game most of the time, but there's something just kind of fundamentally disappointing about the fact that these little things can shift that based entirely on luck when two skilled and equally matched players are doing this.  I don't mind luck in more fully integrated war games, with their historical immersion and generally suboptimal mechanical disruptions (COIN card pulls for instance), but this simply isn't that.  It's more of a Splotter style abstract without the perfect/near perfect information, but at these random junctions, and why?  

I'm probably rating this lower than I would if I weren't disappointed by this game.  I'll continue to play and see if my feelings change, but there are just so many great games with deep decision spaces which bother me WAY less.  Even ones with random card pulls like the Eklund/Wehrle Pax games.

What a wonderful melange of resource gathering, battling with card decks, balancing actions and score in a workable historical setting.  Using victory points to undertake actions was a great twist.  Double thumbs up for effort from the designer, and proud to now have a copy.

Have played four times now, and each game came out quite differently.  Great that there is a difference in 'feel' between games.  I have yet to play Sparta, however...

This game is half way between an eurogame and a wargame. All the euro part is historically based: distribution of ressources between ancient Greek regions, crucial role of population to feed the armies and importance of leader's prestige. The military part of the game is enriched with diplomacy interventions and differentiated Athens and Sparte combat abilities. The main thing is that Polis is tracing very heavy ties between all those dimensions of the game, so each player's decision is very difficult to make.

Has got a lot of potential. The rules are a bit messy and the card translations need to be re-worked. The major thing that bothers me with this game is that every round you draw an event card from a deck of maybe 10 and some of them are actually "no event".

Edit: Designer suggests pulling out the "no event" cards after a few plays. It was just a way to allow new players to get into the game more slowly since some of the events are really powerful. 
Kudos for the designer to take the time and repsond to the players.

After 1 play.

I'm not going to rate this immediately as I realise that there is a lot I've missed or do not yet fully understand with this game. However I can say that I am totally unimpressed with the combat system. Sure if you have more units there then you can draw more cards supposedly giving you an advantage, but you have no knowledge about the cards that your opponent has drawn. So if I'm lucky my opponent will play cards I can counter and I'll play cards that they can't, however it can totally go the other way too and you can be hosed. Obviously the same thing can happen with dice combat but it is a lot less frustrating to me to roll poorly than to have a hand of awesome cards that do no damage to the opponent because I happened to choose cards that they can counter. It is even worse to have what looks like a good hand only for your opponent to play 2 cards of the one type you cannot defend against. Yuck yuck yuck!

The other thing I disliked after my first play was the passing rule. When you pass you opponent can keep performing actions. Now these actions do cost them money but because you've passed there is nothing you can do to counter. Hence I found myself doing piffling little actions that cost me for very little benefit, so I stopped and then my opponent urinated all over me.

Was this game fun? Not on that play it wasn't and at them moment I can't see where the fun would come in.

I was worried that Polis would disappoint as nothing more than yet another cube-pushing resource converter, and yes that's a significant focus of the game. However, the difficulty the game presents struck my fancy far more than the typical "points for everything" style you find in games from Feld & Friends. I had a really hard time getting anything going properly; as soon as I thought I was onto something, I found I'd screwed myself in some major way and spent the next round(s) digging myself out of my hole. Even though there might not be much functional difference between "screwing yourself" and "getting a low score" in a more typical Euro, I still somehow enjoyed this more.

Part of it was certainly the fact that conflict was an option. Even as I was trying to peaceably run around extorting the citizenry for resources as efficiently as possible, I knew there was another whole side to this game, blockading my opponent, sieging his cities, and so on. We didn't explore that much, but it's nice to have in the mix.

In the end, I'm definitely interested in playing this again, even if it didn't blow me away. I'm not entirely sure there's a whole lot here apart from struggling to pull off some relatively short-term plans to get x, y, and z. Despite the dice, sieges are actually pretty dry, and you really have to seek out conflict; even then, I'm not sure how effective it is. To the extent that this devolves into simply acquiring resources for three hours, I'm not so interested. But if there really is some interplay and especially long-term strategies you can work into your play, then I'd say this is a keeper.

A Euro take on the Peloponnesian War. It doesdn't quite work for me, due to the loosey-goosey map iconography and movement rules. And did someone say this was a war, with bloodshed? Somehow I missed that.

RATING: 5
Very good game but my first play was definitely a learning game as my Spartans were soundly defeated. Players alternate taking 2 out of 12 possible actions until both players pass which then moves to an end phase.  The game lasts for 5 turns but I called it on turn 3 after I felt like I was checkmated. It's very puzzle-like to try to get the resources you need while avoiding getting bankrupt on prestige points (thus losing the game).  The one aspect I didn't like was card-based combat system.  There was absolutely no strategy to it. It was purely luck of the draw.  Using the card system used Hanibal: Rome vs. Carthage would have made the game much more fun and interesting.   

Update: I played this again months latter and had to call the game yet again.  I suck at this game.

Polis has been praised by many but I seldom find an opponent for a long 2 player game and cymric's comments are not encouraging.

"[Polis] a tightly guarded and controlled ecosystem where players are leashed and brought to heel at nearly every convenience. This isn't really the railroading I spoke of in earlier versions of this comment because the game doesn't really tell you what to do. On the other hand it does tell you what you can't, again and again and again, leaving you with no option but to proceed where it doesn't curtail you."

In this 2 player game of Athens versus Sparta, each player takes two actions in turn order. There are 12 possible actions, covering the building of units, moving and collecting from provinces. Each province gives a population but requires wheat to feed and at the end of each round, you have to feed and have the option to grow them. The tension in the game is that each province produces different types of goods, and you can only collect once a turn. Meanwhile your opponent can interfere with you. 

There are trade routes which can be blocked by galleys. A neat historical twist is that the Spartans attack first on land, and Athena attacks first in sea. Battles are resolved by playing cards from your hand. 

There are many tough decisions and it's worth playing more. The playing time is around 3 hrs.  I couldn't wrap my head around all the actions yet, and would like to review all the rules to make sure I understand them. But each turn you are constantly worrying about your provinces or what your opponent is going to do. A good  eurogame, with some elements of a wargame. Rating likely to rise with more plays.

Need more plays. May be another 10. Love the resource management and prestige generation already. Trying to understand the proxy meeple more.

Needs a better rulebook. Translation was a bit rough.

Update: After a few plays, I have come to realize this game suffers largely from AP issues. In the later rounds, it becomes more difficult to find an optimal move. Once a move is done, the map changes every forethought on a premeditated move. I assume it becomes easier once the game is played multiple times. Feels like 20 games in, I may have a better outlook on this one. Still enjoy it though.

Muddled through 1.5 rounds, and enjoyed it very much. It's a map-based civ game with clear euro roots, dealing with the city-states of ancient Greece in the time of the Peloponnesian conflict. It has similarities to the very dryyyyyy Twilight Struggle (for example, both share an almost war-game caliber historical verisimilitude) but is so much more my type of 2-player conflict -- multiple paths to scoring points, resource management -- all those wonderful, familiar euro trappings -- and a system of direct conflict that I'd describe as euro-y.

*遊戲總共進行四輪(3,4,5a,5b)，每輪分兩個階段，由聲望（Prestige）低的玩家首先開始行動，如果聲望一樣，斯巴達先。
***行動階段  輪流進行，每次要進行兩個不同的行動(每次行動後結算戰爭)，不做的可跳過(可在第二的行動跳過)，沒跳過的玩家可任意執行行動直到跳過，但每次執行行動前先要支付1個自己的資源（金屬，木頭，葡萄酒，橄欖油，銀，小麥）。

>>發展行動  城邦最後人口都不能使用
1.創建重步兵 選一個城邦將人口方塊(城邦板塊旁的)放到版圖上對應領地上，每個花費1金屬或1銀，城邦Epidamnos和Abdera不能創建重步兵。
2.創建戰艦  選一個城邦將人口方塊放到版圖上城邦箭頭指示的海域上，每個花費1木頭或1銀，城邦Sparta和Thebai不能創建戰艦。
*放置戰艦跟步兵方塊時，每輪上限等輪數前方數字，上限為每個人的個別上限
3.創建商船：選一個有船錨標記的城邦將移除人口方塊，放船到對應顏色貿易海域上(印有貓頭鷹標記或Λ標記的圓圈)，每個花費1木頭或1銀，只能在自己顏色的城邦做，無數量限制
4.啟動工程  拿該城邦能夠建設的工程支付其費用，放在該城邦上面，城邦上面有工程的不能再拿

>>軍事行動 每次行動要先花費1點聲望
*控制該地域或海域代表方塊數大於對方
5.移動重步兵  選一個目的地，每個重步兵要逐個移動，且海域跟陸域只能選一種(移動到海跟海到陸地不算)，無法通過方塊比對手少的區域(可抵達)，達到上限的區域也不能通過(戰艦不算在內)，不能進入城邦Epidamnos，Abdera和外國地區。
*IONIA和SIKELIA地區與希臘本土視為被海洋隔開，只能從海上往返，城邦Chalkis，Korkyra和Chios不視為島嶼，他們是城邦所在陸域的一部分
6.移動戰艦 規則同步兵，只能在海域移動
7.圍攻城邦 必須控制該區域且有方塊數至少等同於城邦城防值(最左數字)，不能圍攻兩方本城。擲骰檢定
>大於等於城防值就成功，拿取城邦板塊(包括所有的工程)，中立城邦獲得基礎人口，敵方城邦當前人口數量換成你的，最後，進攻方獲得等於城防值的聲望，如果敵方使臣在城內，則被俘虜
>小於城防值失敗，進攻方失去一個重步兵，如果該城邦屬於對手，則城邦還要損失1人口方塊，當城邦無人口時變為中立城邦
8.徵收貢物 選一個你的城邦，將該地區內的己方重步兵放到圖板左方對應城邦的貢物格，並獲得對應的資源（同種資源時必須從左至右放置），放一個圓片在該貢物格，表示此輪不能在該地區再次徵收，步兵方塊回該地區，在自己的家鄉地區(同顏色)進行徵收不要花費聲望
*地區ACHAIA無城邦，有重步兵即可執行徵收，但每行動輪也只能徵收1次。

>>政治行動
9.貿易 經由圖板商路(必須不被敵方控制)移動一艘商船到外國市場放到空的船貨格(只有小於等於輪次個格開放)，商船放置時不必從左至右，不能放了不貿易，上半的圖示是支付的資源，下半則是兌換的資源(黃色小麥白色銀)
*1.如果斯巴達的兩個商業城市被雅典控制，則斯巴達不能再執行任何貿易。2.每次貿易行動只能進行1次貿易。
>貨物兌換根據圖板該貨物目前位置跟對應的交換數字，支付對應數量資源拿交換的數字資源，然後擲骰調整市場價值右移
>白銀購買小麥1比1，但購買數量仍然要與船貨格下半的數字一致，擲骰2次，取大的結果，將標記往左移動
*如果貿易港所在海域被對手控制，則港內的商船都無法貿易。例外，陸地貿易。
>陸地貿易：即使貿易港被封鎖，控制城邦Epidamnos的玩家仍可以與Illyria貿易；控制城邦Abdera的玩家仍可以與Thraki貿易。
10.移動使臣 規則同步兵，但不受控制跟上限規則影響，途徑的每個敵人單位，都要向其支付1銀(不是給對手)，陸上移動時起始地和目的地的敵方重步兵也要
*每個城邦只允許有1個使臣，使臣不能直接從海上移動到城邦Sparta和Thebai，也不能從Sparta和Thebai直接移動到海上(因為沒有箭頭)
11.釋放使臣 支付2銀給對手，將使臣放回自己的本城。
12.煽動內戰 需要該城邦有使臣存在，花費基礎人口X2(中立)X3(敵方)數量的銀，獲得所賄賂的人口數的聲望，該板塊跟工程都拿走
*不能煽動本城

**戰鬥  在一個玩家回合結束後，如果有8個以上的雙方單位在同一區域，則戰鬥發生，如果一方已經PASS，則戰鬥要等到雙方都PASS以後才會發生（如果此時仍然符合戰鬥觸發條件）。抽等於自己單位數量的戰鬥牌。進攻方先亮出2張戰鬥牌，然後防守方嘗試打出對應的陣型，卡牌上方式陸戰，下方是海戰，防守方每張不一樣的牌失去一個方塊，進攻方拿該牌上方的聲望，對應的陣型則進攻方或的卡牌數字差值的聲望(最小0)，之後，進攻方抽2張戰鬥牌；防守方每損失1個單位則少抽1張戰鬥牌，最多抽2張，之後攻守交換再一次
*陸地上紅色為先功方，海上藍色為先功方
*打出戰鬥牌SALPINX CALL的玩家必須失去1點聲望，但該牌只有在進攻時才一定會殺死對手一個單位（即使對手打出MERCENARIES也要死一個單位）。
MERCENARIES在進攻時不會殺死敵軍。
若以下情況發生，則戰鬥立刻結束（即使區域仍符合戰鬥觸發條件也要立刻結束戰鬥；但當下一個玩家的回合結束後，如果仍然符合戰鬥觸發條件，戰鬥會再次發生）
1.戰鬥牌堆沒有足夠的牌。
2.在抽牌前，某方支付對手1聲望，宣佈撤退。可以在戰鬥剛開始時就宣佈撤退。
3.某玩家在該區域擁有的單位數只有1。
戰鬥結束後，將棄牌、手牌和牌庫全部混在一起重洗，以備下次戰鬥使用。

*行動輪結束階段
1.工程  工程板塊移到城邦下方，並獲得標明的聲望，中立城邦的也會完成
*工程Artist的效果是向上取整。
2.供養 支付所有城邦人口方塊總數相等的小麥，不夠付的可改付聲望或是放棄該城邦(取消該城邦的所有工程)，但不能移除城邦人口
3.人口增長 一比一支付小麥來增加城邦的人口，增長不能超過城邦中間數字，總數不能超過右邊數字
4.特大城市 每個超出其中間數字的城邦拿1點聲望
5.貯藏損耗 橄欖油、葡萄酒和小麥的庫存量減半(總數/2向上取整)。第4輪跳過此階段。
6.貢金 可以將聲望以1:1比例轉換成銀。可選擇是否兌換。第4輪跳過此階段。

*準備下一個行動輪
行動輪標記往右移，從貢物格移除所有的圓片，將商船放回貿易港，開新的3個新工程(舊的棄掉)，抽取一張新事件卡牌

*遊戲結束
1.某玩家不能滿足其本城的小麥/聲望供養需求，則該玩家立刻輸掉遊戲
2.某玩家在新事件卡牌結算前聲望0則輸掉
3.因任何原因，玩家要失去聲望，但已沒有聲望可以失去，立刻輸掉遊戲
4.第4輪結束，所有城邦的人口方塊數加上當前聲望跟工程板塊括號內數字，總分高者獲勝，平手則比六種資源總數

*家鄉地區：即雅典在Attika地區，斯巴達在Lakedaimon地區
*本城：雅典的本城是Athenai，斯巴達的本城是Sparta
*科林斯棧道：控制城邦Korinthos的玩家可利用棧道（圖版上並未標出棧道）讓自己的重步兵/商船/戰艦/使臣直接在KYKLADES和IONIO PELAGOS之間移動。

**變體規則**
*圍攻變體 當圍攻中立城邦失敗時，將被殺死的重步兵放置到被圍攻的城邦板塊上，如果玩家在下一個回合繼續圍攻該城邦，玩家會因每個在被圍攻城邦板塊上的重步兵而獲得擲骰結果+1的修正。如果玩家在他的下一個回合不再繼續圍攻該城邦或玩家失去對相關地區的控制權，則移走被殺死的重步兵。
*第一次遊戲變體
如果這是你的第一次遊戲，記住，你只要玩3個行動輪，而不是4個（遊戲將在第5α行動輪結束）。

I feel that 'prestige' is misnamed: the political standing of Athens or Sparta shouldn't plummet just because they're moving some troops around. 'Political will' or 'political capital' might fit better.
Some other commentators have mentioned the frustration of the besiege die roll, and I agree. Rolling a pyramid-shaped D4 is already an unpleasant experience (better to use a custom 8- or 12-sided D4), and adding luck that can't be mitigated to that makes it worse.
Also, the way you have to send your armies around collecting resources makes it feel less wargame, more pickup and deliver.
On the plus side, the game looks gorgeous and is generally smooth and elegant in its mechanisms (besieging excepted, but there is an official diceless variant for that).
Overall, I think euro gamers will take to this, but wargamers may be disappointed.

Not sure how to rate this game. I've had one play. It's really not a wargame. There are some random aspect (events, siege results, battles), but overall, it's mostly about managing the limited resources on hand. It seems there's never enough wheat to do anything. Once you've feed your existing cities, whatever's is used to increase population. I didn't find there was any incentive to "conquer" other cities, as the "wheat footprint" simply increased with no evident benefit. 

The game appears deceptively simple, but the choices to make are not so simple...

What an incredibly interesting game. There are so many choices and options and points are in constant flux. The rulebook makes this game seem far more complex than it is. At it's core, the game is not that difficult, but man is there so much to think about in this game. Actions are simple and quick, yet each one is agonizing. Yes, there is stuff that is cut throat, but it's not nearly as bad because both parties have to do it to survive.

This game is either going up to a 9 or a 10 or it's going to drop down a point due to how tough it is to get to the table.

Reluctant to rate this so low low, as I do really like the concept. The economy of the game is quite harsh and you can come close to losing the game without player interaction. However, I do not enjoy the combat, which mostly gets decided on the first 2 cards. There doesn't seem to be much potential to outplay the opponent with tactical movement or card play. You end up playing the game (or getting played by the game) and not the player.

Die rolling to capture a city owned by nobody and you lose the battle, a part of your army, your action point and prestige on a 1, which happened 3 times in the second age. Why is this in the game?

Devilishly clever game. You can't make war on the first round, so you can get spread your hegemony and get your economy underway. But those two goals require a careful balance, as more mouths to feed require more grain. And for grain, you need merchant trades. And for merchant trades, you need resources to trade. To draw resources,  you lose prestige - the currency for most of the common actions, and also VPs. So how do you get prestige? By growing your hegemony, and by building projects - which require resources. All the while, your opponent is spreading his influence, building up forces...

Everything is a trade-off. No choices are obvious. Even before outright war kicks off, every move your opponent makes casts a shadow on your endeavors - depressing the value of the resources you want to sell, blocking land access to a territory with resources you need, threatening to block trade routes. Taken together, it generates a tremendous tension.

And this isn't a bloodless, sterile cube-pusher. Polis is an insightful and evocative simulation of the wars between Athens and Sparta. The designers hit this one out of the park.

Ein Zwei-Spieler-Game, das die Konfrontation zwischen Sparta und Athen während des Peloponnesischen Krieges auf einfache, tendenziell wenig (!) konfrontative Weise darstellt und in maximal 2,5 Stunden spielbar ist (bei Regelkenntnis dürfte sich die Spieldauer bis auf 1,5 Stunden verkürzen). Wenig konfrontative Konfrontation? Ja, der Sieger ist derjenige, der über die größte Bevölkerung (Massaker sind da kontraproduktiv) und über das meiste Prestige verfügt, das man u.a. durch kulturelle Errungenschaften gewinnt, aber durch jedwede militärische Aktion wie durch die Unfähigkeit, seine möglichst wachsende Bevölkerung mit Getreide zu versorgen, verspielt. Kurz: In „Polis“ dreht sich mehr um das clevere Management eines erst auszubauenden, überschaubaren Reiches als um die dennoch spannenden, in einem Minigame ausgetragenen Kämpfe.

Based on 1 learning game - this is a resource collection game through and through, with a little bit of combat/die rolling (rolling d4's suck).  It's the type of game where you use up almost all your resources each round and are focused on how to get more the next round, especially wheat, wheat, wheat (although you can use prestige to cover missing wheat).  Prestige (and silver) seem tough to get early on (you lose immediately if you go to 0 and a lot of your actions require spending 1 prestige), but once you have a few more cities, you quickly focus on how are you going to get enough wheat to feed all your pop/grow your cities over their base pop if possible.  The card-based combat system is nothing special, probably the worst part of the game for me. Resource collection/trading reminds me ever so slightly of Concordia, but the way you use your total pop from the 1-2 cities you have in an area to collect resources feels pretty unique.  The main reason I don't give it an 8 is my general preference for 3+ player games over 2p-only; this system could work perfectly well for a multiplayer game.

Resisted this one for a while, but like in a good way, you know? I knew I would fall into it eventually, it hit all the marks for me--complex euro, light wargame, no hidden information, 2p, Peloponnesian War, good looking map, etc. It was inevitable, our relationship, but still I enjoyed the flirtation period, the slow pull that culminated in my purchase, after a play with a friend.

Tons of depth. Feels really good to lock down a turn and finally play everything in the right order--no mean feat!

RATING: 4
Many options, but very limited in what you can do given intense resource scarcity. You mostly spend time worrying about feeding your populous, which limits projects and conflict to maybe one or two or three per game.

Playing time is perfect and I admire the artwork and support from the designer and the two included scenarios, plus the bonus one found on BGG seem worth trying. 

The combat system is not as fun as it first appears, and the prestige and board position you gain from it seems limited, non-decisive, which seems to be the opposite of what a (rare) battle should be. It's hard to imagine naval battles occurring much. 

I'd like this game to have toned down the resource management and upped the wargame element.

Got absolutely destroyed as Athens in my first go-around, possibly because I lacked a good source for wheat and also, most likely, because I'm bad at getting economic engines to build up steam until I know a game better.

A very tough resource management and area control game. I need to play more. Not very sure about the replay value, despite the fact that the game comes with 2-3 additional scenarios. The first moves of both players seems to be the same every time if you have an idea about what's going on.

RATING: 9
I'm still a little undecided as to how much I like this. The indecision is between a lot and a heck of a lot. Weighing on my mind are the besieging die rolls - yes it is possible to roll a one more than seven times in a row. I've said it applies thematically about the Space Race in Twilight Struggle and I'll say it again here - I don't mind the luck of the dice, but I do have a feeling that there should be a modifier rewarding failed besieging attempts to apply to future attempts. Instead there are penalties built in. Oh well, it is what it is. (Just played a game where I failed five besiege attempts in a row against level 2 Polis - only my first besiege attempt in the game succeeded. There should be a 75% chance of success each roll. Well that game sucked! Dice, eh.)

The game is very simple to grasp. The rules are written in an odd phraseology, but it helps to read it like a conversation in a thick Spanish accent. (You might hear Fernando Alonso or Plácido Domingo, but I prefer to imagine Penélope Cruz.) The examples are excellent and although the rules are apparently being cleaned up as I type this, I was able to grasp everything quite easily with the help of the examples. What I mean to say is that I didn't find the rulebook as difficult to understand as I'd heard it would be. It's very well laid out and is in many respects one of the better ones I've come across.

The components are good quality. Tiles that punch out beautifully always make a good impression upon me. A board and pieces that will stand up to many games. The cards are very much on the thin side (nice art), but I double sleeved mine (yes, I said "double" and I don't sleeve many of my games), because without it I wasn't sure they'd hold up too well to repeated plays - and I'm hoping to see repeated plays out of Polis. Not a problem.

There's no one thing that's particularly groundbreaking about Polis, but the theme marries well with the mechanics to deliver a very good, very tight gaming experience. It's got a well thought out management of resources (population and other), positioning, trade, card driven combat uncertainty, options and replayability. I think I quite like it, but those die rolls... argh... they bug me sometimes. (And is it just me, or are four sided dice hard to pick up?) I suppose I should just stay away from Korinthos and Syrakousai if I'm not going to roll a 4. Hmm. Dice - you just never know.

Now, it has been pointed out to me that I perhaps shouldn't expect to be too lucky/foolish and go for the more valuable polis with my Proxenos. Failure costs after all. Common sense tells me that although using my Proxenos is a sure thing (and therefore the intelligent thing to do), I'm a cheapskate and civil war is very costly (who cares about the people - silver isn't that easy to come by after all). Okay, okay, using my Proxenos makes sense, but the optimist in me wants to try my lucky die and thinks I'm entitled to a four now and then (when I want it, of course). Seriously though, if my opponent is rolling fours and I'm rolling ones then that's the game. I can play as cleverly as I want, but it's not going to help. Now, this would really bug me in a four hour game, but here (if it happens a lot), it's just moderately irritating because it's only a 90 minute time investment. (Did I mention that I thought modifiers for failed attempts were a good idea? Ah look at me trying to modify a well play tested game. Jeez, I'm annoying myself. Write out 500 times: I must learn to accept it the way it is, I must learn to accept it...)

Polis: Fight for the Hegemony - go out and buy yourself a copy. It reminds me of Hannibal RvC, The End of the Triumvirate, in fact lots of other games I enjoy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Polis is an excellent and tight resource management game where every action has to be weighed very carefully. Mistakes can easily lead to playing oneself into a corner from which it can be hard to escape.

If I have one criticism it is that bad die rolls during sieges can be frustrating and consequential. I prefer to play with the variant rule (described in the official rule book) where an unsuccessful siege adds +1 to the siege roll of the following turn.  

*Update: After a few more games the sieges don't frustrate me much anymore. If your game position is going to hinge on a siege roll, you probably should not be sieging, but be looking for other options. If a failed siege roll won't break you, then by all means roll that die!

So, I've played this a few times and I have to say that it's pretty interesting.  It isn't the easiest game for me to wrap my brain around and some of the play tends to seem a bit rote as there are some areas that you are always going to go for.  There are lots of things that interest me in this and I'm glad that it's implemented online on BGA as it might be a little fiddly to play live.  Doesn't stop me from owning it though.  :-)

[2 plays] Incomplete game, although I think Carter's Athenians had the edge on my Spartans economically and would have won if we had continued into the wee hours.

This is a fascinating economic war game, far more about positioning and economics than battle, but the ignoring the wargame aspects could be totally devastating as trade, income, and wheat for your population would all dry up. I really want to play it again soon while it is fresh in our minds. I expect my rating could go up.

2nd game incomplete, but we both played very differently. I think my Spartans had a slight edge, but who knows. Learned a bunch more and had fun.

Наряду с Клаустрофобией и карточными Колонизаторами, вторая полноценная дуэльная игра. Но здесь совсем другой антураж. Игра превзошла всякие ожидания. Особенно к третьей партии, когда уже стали понятны базовые основы успешного развития нации. При том, что предполагал, что беру некую стратегическую боевую игру, на деле оказалось, что бои здесь имеют больше тактический характер, нежели масштабный стратегический. Да, и не в боях прелесть данной игры, а скорее в необычности придуманных действий и их сочетаний!

Old PnP 2 player game on the peloponnesian war. A mix of commerce and warfare. I'm pretty sure I'll love this one, it's the next on the list to learn.

I like Weuros, or however they are called. I think the future will give us many good games like this. I surely prefer those to traditional hex&counter wargames.

Kellemes kis kétszemélyes játék a Polis, ahol az egyik fél Spártát, a másik Athént testesíti meg. Katonákat és csatahajókat gyártunk, amivel területeket szerzünk Görögország területén, illetve kereskedőkkel a közeli államokkal kereskedhetünk főleg búza szerzése céljából, ez ugyanis a kulcs nyersanyag a játékban, amivel a körök végén a városainkban lakó embereket kell ellátnunk és ezzel tudjuk növelni is a számukat, ami az egyik győzelmi pont szerző lehetőség. Hódításokkal és különböző kulturális építmények építésével szerezhetünk még győzelmi pontokat. A játék 4 körös, ami kevésnek tűnik, de minden körben végtelen akciója van mindkét félnek. 2 akciót hajt végre az egyik, majd 2 a másik fél. Érdekesség, hogy körönként nő az egy területen állomásoztatható katonák száma, így a játék vége felé több lehetőségünk van a körünkben velük cselekedni. A csata bár erősen szerencsefüggő jól megoldott kártyák segítségével. Míg Sparta főleg tartományai kizsigerelésével, Athén kereskedéssel tud megfelelő mennyiségű búzát begyűjteni, ezért kicsit különböző a két fél tipikus játéka, de a rengeteg lehetőség miatt változatosan lehet a győzelemre hajtani. Hibájának talán az hozható fel, hogy ha hibákat vét az egyik fél, a másik elhúzhat úgy, hogy ne legyen esélye a másiknak. A szabály ismertetése azért nem rövid és a játék is bőven elhúzódhat, ezért nem biztos, hogy gyakran kerülne elő egy-egy társaságban, ettől függetlenül egyértelműen tetszett a Polis.

At first it felt a bit of a dry brain burner, being so centred on resource management. But then, a grand narrative emerged with an elegant depiction of the distinct issues faced by both poleis, as well as a touch of epos through the card driven combat system I was initially so wary of. Quite possibly a masterpiece.

Very interesting Euro style economic conflict game. I don't say wargame because it isn't really. It's not that complicated to learn the rules but very hard to play well; proper play is not intuitive. I've played a fair bit and I still feel super clueless as to what exactly is good play. I like it a lot but this is not a game I'd recommend to everyone. Too odd for many. Also super brutally punishing. One stupid move can destroy you. Lovely clean components too.

A few years later and I need to add a few more words: This game remains one of my favorites. I think the randomness in sieges is a minor flaw but a very forgivable one. This game is so weirdly challenging and so adorably charming that I'm just tickled that I own it (even though most of my games have actually been online at Board Game Arena).

Great theme play.  Game is fairly easy to learn and play.  Your options are a bit overwhelming at first.  Game is fun.  The market dynamic, taxing of provinces, and combat are interesting mechanics.  The components are excellent - beautiful mounted board, wood playing pieces, well laid out player mats and somewhat durable cards with fair artwork.  The English rulebook is terrible - very poor translation.  Game time is about 2 hours which feels right.

Holy cow this game.  Can't believe I haven't rated it before now...an amazing take on the Peloponnesian wars, with a beautiful resource engine at its core and a wonderful maneuver and battle system.  I don't know any other games like this and there should be lots of them!

Minor quibbles:  not sure game is balanced (Sparta seems to have the upper hand), some have complained about the siege system which doesn't bother me but CAN tip the game one way or another based on luck, and I had a weird edge case arise in one game where it felt like we were trapped in an unintended (by the designer) situation.

[2013-02-12] Very intriguing game, I love it. Even the first move in the first turn is already a hard struggle. Building troops? Easy. Conquering other cities? Also easy, but this might leave your home town undefended! So, better to build galleys first? But you need the wood to trade in for food! And remeber the prestige cost for military actions...
Man, this game is a challenge, but with very decent components and an acceptable play time.

I don't like the importance of luck when besieging larger city states, on the one hand, and I find the combat system a little bit over-engineered compared to the very slim and elegant design elsewhere. Both aspects are doomed to be houseruled, I'd say.

As of now, I'm not sure I get it.  I thought this might be a good semi wargame to supplement my love for Twilight Struggle, but I just don't get this one at all yet. 

Those seiges are way too random and so much of the game hinges on those early sieges.  Maybe I shouldn't be trying them as much, but the amount of silver we can get hasn't really been up there so far during our games.  We're probably missing something, and I'm still exploring this, though the online implementation at BGA seems like it's got at least a few bugs that we've come across. 

In the end, It's an interesting diversion, but I don't think it will catch on for me.  I might try that diceless siege variant though.

Hybrid of war and eurogame.

Most of the game you`re really under pressure. You need prestige points to collect resources, move your army and start a siege. You get new prestige by conquer new territories. If you have more territories, you need more food. You can get the food by collect resources from territories or from trade. For the trade you need resources or money. You can`t play static.

RATING: 9.5
Polis transfers you into period of wars. But you will rely more on tactics and moving of troops with emphasis on dominance, than on force and direct battle conflict. Great atmosphere and excellent gameplay awaits you in game designed specially for two players. It guarantees broad options for your choices, which can be used during rounds with no strictly given length and simple rules. Choice from twelve different actions and toll for military actions only raises tension of the whole match. Units can be moved as far as you want, but they have to have all the same destination. Moreover you must respect stacking limit of hoplites (soldiers) in these territories ,while moving them. Allowed numbers are raising as time in match goes by, which makes also for more tense experience to the end of game. Polis brings more scenarios from the same time period of greek history and guarantees real freedom in each of them and plenty of roads to victory. But only one can prevail. Do not leave it on chance and lead your men towards your vision on greater good!

Rating will likely go up with further plays, as I think this game is one with a steep learning curve. For us, it was our first game and I guess we did a tremendously bad job, because both of us didn't anticipate just how much effort you have to invest into nourishing your people, just how expensive waging war is, how extremely valuable resources are (don't spend resources during the first round lightly!) and how hard it is to get your hands on the much needed resources (which are really scarce) Starting from round 5 alpha there wasn't many options at hand for both of us, since we hardly had anything on our tableaus speaking for a rather poor engine we had built up to that point.
The battle system, while adding minor random elements (just like sieging a neutral city), is rather interesting. Now sieging neutral cities is a pretty huge aspect and a very contrasting element of luck in a ruleset that otherwise does its best fighting off good luck/bad luck factors fairly good. Somehow it doesn't mix well with the rest of the game, like a debris.

A deep civ builder with war-game touches and euro mechanics? For 2 players? Sounds like I should have a look (and I got it cheap, too). After my first play I feel very intrigued by what I have seen, there is a lot going on and a lot of freedom about what to do, it is feeling far less restrictive than many other games in my collection, but still has a great puzzly euro feel. Second play was solo and it works really great despite the battle cards. This game wants to be studied to see strategy, but is really rewarding even played solo. Will definitely try to get more plays in. Could even become a 9 with more plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
This game blew me away. So many options and so much going. The rules are tight and clear and the game play is so rich and expansive. 

Learning curve: the rules help a great deal, but there is still a lot going on and enough mechanics and systems that it can seem daunting and difficult to grasp. Still, this is a pretty accessible game overall, medium to medium-heavy weight and with a reasonable play time of (I would say) 2-3 hours (the upper end being if you are the type to get analysis paralysis or to enjoy thinking through possible moves before executing your turn).

The key is balancing your resource management. Prestige represents political influence and power and at the end of the game that plus population equals your score. Makes sense. But you must spend prestige to do pretty much anything with your military, including moving forces around. How do you get prestige? Well, one way is by conquering a polis with your military. Reciprocal feedback, baby! If you aren't careful, you will paint yourself into a chicken and egg situation early on where you are constantly prestige-poor and can't "do anything". The other important resource is wheat, which is hard to get and must be sought after. Trade is crucial here, so watch your trade routes and build up a good navy. Oh, but to do that you will need to spend wood, so get a good supply of that, too, and also population... oh, but population, like prestige, ends up being your victory points, so don't build needlessly. By the way, your land army also costs population, and also metal. You'll want that, too, with the same caveats.

Oh. And, about that population that you want so bad because it counts as victory points? Well, be careful... you have to feed the population at the end of each round and you do that with wheat, so go see what I said about wheat. You'll need that to grow your population, too. Olive oil and wine are nice, because you can trade them for wheat, so if you have access to the right markets, try and use that to your advantage there. You can also get silver that way. Silver is awesome because it's a kind of wildcard resource that you can substitute for (mostly) any other resource, like use it instead of metal when building land units. You can also use it at trade ports to buy wheat. That can be a lifesaver. By the way, trading affects market values... so if you trade too much in one thing you will quickly flood the market and cause inflation due to lower demand of that commodity. Or you can do this intentionally to devalue something your opponent needs to trade more than you do.

Whew. Like, I said... lots and lots of resource management. There's also a proxenos, kind of like a diplomatic envoy, and this guy can be key to getting prestige by taking cities with political, rather than military, means. Essentially you BUY them... with silver. Lots of it. So, yeah, get silver. There are also projects you can build and the specific geography of the Aegean matters for a lot here, too. Even the Diolkos , a paved walkway where ships could be transported by land across the Isthmus of Corinth, is accounted for. 

The awesome thing about this game is that there's no easy answer. Everything is so tightly interconnected and interdependent that you want (and need) to do everything, but you can't. You must choose a specific, focused, strategy. Become strong in some areas and manage your weaknesses very selectively trying not to overlook a fatal flaw. Your opponent will do the same. Try to use your strength against your opponent's weaknesses.

Is this a wargame? Absolutely! Albeit one that focuses on politics, trade, economics, and logistics rather than just combat itself. In fact, combat is downplayed here compared to most other games, but I think that might be a more accurate simulation in some regards. It is fitting for the subject matter. Battles themselves are resolved with cards in a system simpler than, but comparable to, Hannibal: Rome vs Carthage. It feels simplistic and abstract, sure, but any more so than just rolling dice? There's enough interesting going on in these little mini-games to give me a better feel of the capriciousness and chance of battle, while still letting me feel as if I'm influencing its outcome in a meaningful way with my tactical decisions.

There is SO much history in this game. It is exceedingly rich and deep, both in abstract strategic terms, and if you like your Peloponnesian War, this will make you happy. The event cards offer some great historical counterfactuals and hypotheticals, as well as accounting for many real events. The effects are subtle, but can be deceptively game-changing. It's all quite brilliant and done with a lot of love, thought, and integrity. I love that it uses the Greek transliterations of words and names. If Thucydides made a game... this would be it!

Components are exceptionally nice. Great quality and value. This is one of those games that when you open the box, you step back and gush over it all. Card quality could be better, but small complaint. Everything from the art to the pieces feels like a real sophisticated game. Sorry if that sounds pretentious, but I just hate buying something meant to be played by adults that looks like it was made to be a kids toy.

Anyhow, my highest praise for this game. This game deserves more attention than it's gotten.

This is an intense game with a lot of strategies. Instinctively, it feels like Sparta has an advantage, but both sides have their advantages and strengths. I look forward to diving deeper into this game. The card driven combat is interesting. Unpredictable, but with strategy. My only criticism is the event cards. Some feel game changing with little the player can do to prepare for.

03/13/17 - Lowering my score. It's a great game, but the game is not balanced. It's really unfortunate, because the game is very well designed. Also, the battles have too much effect on the game with little the player (especially Athens) can do prepare for battles.

This is a gem as game and as representation of the Peloponnesian war. This is a very meaty game. Both sides have several viable options for win. The game has only 4 turns, but it gets more and more intense as the game progresses. A lot of options, and the question is what is more efficient? Brilliant design. A lot of exploitation of given circumstances. The production value is very high. My only complaint is the rules. The rules are much better than the original print and play version. But the language is not flowing and there are no examples in a couple of critical areas. You need to read the FAQ posted here in BGG to clarify a couple of things. Read the rules, read them again, then read the FAQ, and then play the game, and then play the game again. After this process, you will appreciate how good is this game!

At the start of my first game, I sat and stared at the board wondering what I could possibly do.  But it wasn't a frustrating feeling somehow, it was intriguing and inviting.  I like the asymmetry of this game.  I like the range of actions available and how this range can get limited quickly.  I like the tough, meaningful decisions.  I like that your strategy may need to adapt and I like that you can interfere with your opponent more or less as the game condition and your own position evolves. I like the toughness of this game.  I love the feel and look of the components.  This game led me to read three books on the War (plus Thucydides' account) and all I read reinforced my appreciation of the game.

Brilliant Game

Called a "Weuro" this is one of those games I call a "History" game like "Maria" and "Friedrich".

The military aspects of this game dominate every decision, but one must be aware of resource collection and political standing. Do something politically unwelcome and your prestige goes down even if it was the right thing to do.

Like "Maria" and "Friedrich" it is often the wisest thing to run away from a battle instead of fight it; the threat of a remaining military unit is greater than the battle it could have won.

Good strategic economic game of 5th century Greece. The game is all about building up your prestige through trading and control. The restrictive rules on combat mean that there is very little of it. This is really not too bad when you realize that the game covers a very long period of time. One funky thing was the event cards. There are 8 cards for each of the four "rounds" but you only draw one. Also, many of the cards say, "No event." Just seems a bit of a letdown. On the other hand, when an even occurs, it is usually very consequential.

I keep reducing my rating with each play. I understand the notion of having hoplites collect resources, but it would have made more sense to have the population in a given Polis produce wheat/wine/oil etc. Instead the population serve no functional purpose aside from being made into armies or naval/merchant piece. Your population(in many cases) needs an army to feed itself while the cost of maintaining an army and navy is... free? The minimum threshold for battle in a region is nonsensical. Most projects can be placed in an unconquerable capital. The events do little to add variability to the game or give it any distinct flavor. As the game progresses, I have less freedom of choice (maybe Sophoclean determinism is part of the theme). I believe that there is PLENTY of room for me to improve with Athens, but the required number of plays to do so is a poor investment of time that could be spent with a game that's more competitive and fun. I really don't like bashing a designer's work, particularly one that is so responsive to questions and supportive of their game, but I was very disappointed with the game. I wish that someone had warned me to steer clear of it.

Never has a game been so intensely frustrating for me to play, and yet so intricately perfect.  The gameplay is an exercise in futility, as it is common for me to groan as my opponent seizes on a move that I didn't quite have enough actions to prevent him from trying.

It's not often that direct conflict games see an economic engine as rich as this one, and it's an excellent way of modeling this war, particularly as it was fought over many grueling years and flare-ups.  The mechanic of Athenian Navy vs. Spartan land troops is very well done with a very simple battle system.  Every mechanic in this game feels familiar, but the whole of it is a very new beast.  The different commodities have a mind-bending interrelation that will have you gnashing your teeth, wanting to have all of them.  Beautiful components make the experience an extra special treat.  

After 9 games, I am unsure about balance.  Once the Spartans identify the most important provinces, they have a significant edge in keeping them.  Once we figured that out, we've only a few times where the Athenian player was able to sneak it out.  That said, there's some promising openings we haven't tried, so I don't feel comfortable passing a final judgement yet.

Still, even if we do declare the game imbalanced, getting there has been a ton of fun. 
 Recommended for the two-player aficionados out there.

One of my favorite things in games is when the economy is tied to some spatial element. Polis is a magnificent example of this- trying to expand and feed your empire is a delicate balancing act, exacerbated by your opponent's ability to disrupt your plans. Players attack each others' units, besiege or instigate civil war in each others' cities, and blockade each others' trade routes, among other things. Spatial positioning, as well as managing a tight economy, are the name of the game. Not to mention the fun battle system highly reminiscent of Hannibal: Rome vs Carthage, and for those hung up on theme this has it in spades. An excellent game that I expect to be one of my 2p go-tos moving forward.

Polis is an intriguing mix of a civilization game, a cube pushing Euro game and a straight up war game. All of these things influence game play, but none of them dominate. Set during the Peloponnesian War, the players as Athens and Sparta try to spread their influence throughout Greece. This backdrop works well, because the bickering city-states of the era have been translated into a very interesting resource management game.

For the most part, what players are trying to do is increase the population of their cities, as well as bring new ones into the empire. The problem, is those growing cities consume a lot of food and unlike the modern world, centralized farming and distribution of food was not yet a thing. So to get that food, you have to send out soldiers to get it. (Because as I mentioned earlier, these city-states do not like to cooperate!) Of course drafting soldiers reduces the population, negating the need for food. So you go conquer more city-states, which need food...and on and on.

This tug of war shows up in every aspect of the game, the cities and food are just one of many. Fighting is costly and usually unproductive, as there just aren't enough men to solidify your hold on conquered territories and they will often flip back to your opponent. Unfortunately, every action you take to run your empire requires prestige points, as only a leader that has seized glory in battle is worthy of being followed. So you will find yourself fighting losing battles over worthless scraps of land, just to eek out a little glory to fund your next endeavor. It's absolutely brilliant and really brings home the feeling of Empire building in ancient Greece.

First Impression: This looks like a very well made area control game. An added bonus for this is that it's a two player game. This has received priority to hit our gaming table.

Very compelling two player game.  Not entirely sure of all the strategic levers to pull yet, but I'll explore it more in future plays.

This game is an amazingly tight resource management euro (think Agricola) with some wargaming throwing in.
I'm afraid I just don't have the time to learn it.

Tough choices in an ever escalating race to avoid economic blockade and collapse. For economic resource building this is a good as it gets.  Excellent!

Pues no se que decir de este juego salvo que me gusta. Me le hice en Print And Play cuando su autor le colgó de forma gratuita en la BSK y en cuanto me entere que le sacaban a la venta me apunte al preorder
Calidad de materiales excelente, sin excesiva complejidad de reglas pero con profundidad de juego, cuidado al detalle, buena ambientación histórica.......Me encanta

Empieza despacito pero ya vas planificando tus movimientos para después, que el juego se acelera y se convierte en una gran experiencia. Totalmente recomendable

A bit disappointed considering the hype.  The rulebook's translation leaves a lot to be desired.  The rulebook would really benefit from an extended example of play because it is difficult to understand how everything works together during your first game.  The two sides are asymmetrical and you have to understand and play to their strengths.  The game plays a bit strange.  After one game, I'm still trying to decide what I think about this game.  I was not really crazy about losing prestige points every time you moved, started a siege, or collected.

This game fulfills my desire for a strategic wargame with resource management that looks and feels somewhat like a euro. 

Inside is a very good truely strategic game with a lot of depth. It succeeds in giving me the feeling of fighting the peloponnesian conflict on several levels and everything from putting blockades, sneaking with your diplomat, trading, clashing with armies, pillaging, building monuments... combines gameplaywise. There are plenty of meaningfull decisions to be made each turn and you constantly are positioning yourself to strike at the opponent at the right time. 

Combat is done with cards, I like the cardplay because it's quick and easy and I think it's better than dice. 

Minor critique is the siege mechanic that could have been better, but the developer already tried to make a workable diceless variant and there are other acceptable variants.

Juego de desarrollo económico y militar dónde compite Esparta contra Atenas. Debes conquistar ciudades para lograr producir bienes que te harán gaanr PV, los cuales tb sirven para realizar acciones contra tu enemigo.

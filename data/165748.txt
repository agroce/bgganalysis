I sold it because the rules were pretty damn fiddly and there was limited replay value IMO, but I enjoyed my time with it. Wish I kept it since it went OOP.

A great game? Maybe not, but it does what it was designed to do very well. Great fun. Especially with a larger grou of horror fans.

THEME THEME THEME!

I found this game to be fun and tense.  Once you are going, it's really easy to get into.  You gotta like the old school hex and counter games.  Don't expect minis, mounted board, etc.  Get the right people and it's a blast!

This is another special game "happening" from Nate Hayden - an homage to old school "magazine game" components and gameplay as well as, of course, slasher flicks. As with his other games, form and content inform each other and the process involves the product. This is art, folks. The game feels like you're transported into one of those awful, creepy movies in some ways. All of this said, the game requires your cooperation with the designer to bring about the atmosphere and the game experience; if you want the game to provide packaged, promised fun for you, it won't. It's not for everyone and it's not for every gaming occasion even for me. Nate's games don't offer consistency anyway, they offer a special experience. You have to be interested in and in the right mood to do your part to receive it. Speaking for myself, I am already jumping in the black van and speeding off down the dirt road with him.

The Emperors of Eternal Evil have done it again.  Low-fi, sordid, underground feel that comes across like an early 90's Metal Zine.  The game is pretty simple but is full of flavor and produces a natural tension due to running away from a superior foe that will cut you down if they catch you.  The game has a penchant for producing memorable scenes just like Cave Evil.  Great stuff that really sticks in your mind.

Don't expect balance though and you can easily get eliminated early, stuck watching as the rest of the group plays.  It's capricious and doesn't pull any punches in that way.  This is definitely more about the entire package than the specific gameplay mechanisms.

This hobby/medium needs more provocative, renegade concepts like this. Blows away pretty much all of the Kickstarter bullshit at which you people throw your money.

All cut out and ready to go. Possibly following my plays of ABD this month. Gotta keep on Resolution track and all. 

Reminds me that I need to play Cave Evil more. Barely scratched the corpsepaint. 

Aug 28 - played a few more solo games of Cave Evil and learned this one in the same week. Wasn't way into Psycho Raiders, but it's totally NOT a good solo game for me, so grain of salt.

This is probably.more of an experience than a game, but it's thematically strong, riffing exploitation films from the 1970s.

Very old school. Very outdated. Very modern. This game is forward thinking in that it looks back and realizes that what was done in the past wasn't wrong, it wasn't clunky and new doesn't equal better. This game through the rules, presentation, production and everything else creates more narrative, theme and story than any amount of flavor text or freelance drawings.

UPDATE:  Just came in the mail AND YES YOU NEED TO READ THAT AS A DOUBLE ENTENDRE

These guys are clearly making games to please an audience that consists only of themselves and their personal demons—[i]without compromise[/i].  If you're not sure it's for you then it straight-up isn't—the velvet ropes are there to save the timid from any further discomfort.

But if you see yourself in this, if the howl from the page calls to something darker beyond the horizon of your eyes... well, then follow it home.

UPDATE:  First play told an amazing story even though we botched a bunch of rules.  If you think of this as a grindhouse simulator, a set of RPG skirmish rules, it ends up as a kick-ass party game.  Can't wait to play again!

Excellent effort! Everything you want in a creepy, nighttime death derby. EEE is cornering the market on this genre; and quite aptly I believe. Splendid art, well researched rules, and extra helpings of gruesome sauce.

Cave Evil lite. Perfect for large groups with a fondness for slasher flicks and wonky fun. I can't really imagine a better implementation of the theme. 80s mechanics, 80s flicks. I love it as much as it wants to be loved.

A fun murder simulator.  A must for fans of Texas Chainsaw Massacre and other genre films.  A blast with all groups - would be less fun if it were balanced.  Where else do you grab keys from the town mechanic, hop into his car with him only to find out he's with the Psycho Raiders, who approach and burn you and the car to a crisp.

Mayhem incarnate. This game is a brutally asymmetric hex and counter game simulating a horror movie scenario. The Raiders are much more powerful than the Campers and will easily kill them with enough opportunity. I'd like to play this as the Campers as I think there are some interesting possibilities there. Either way, this nails the theme and lends itself to cinematic moments.

Psycho Raiders plays like an unholy offspring of Rob Zombie and Steve Jackson, with retro mechanics and a splatterpunk theme. The design is not polished, but it delivers a singular experience, punctuated by crude but effective artwork. I made a two-disc soundtrack to play during my games, based entirely on the Top 40 charts circa 1978.

RATING: 9
This is probably my favourite game in terms of concept, and its execution almost fully lives up to that concept.  

The game is grim, grimy and bloody, but still generates plenty of laughs and cheers as it takes the players back to memories of experiencing grindhouse horror movies like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Last House on the Left, and I Spit on Your Grave.  The theme shines through with each and every mechanic, much like the headlights of a black van scouring a dark field for its hidden prey.

The game itself works very, very well, with a couple of hiccups.  The rulebook could be written a little tighter and more logically laid out to make this relatively simple game (though with lots of exceptions) easier to learn, teach and reference.  The worst offence, though, is the incredibly muddy printing of the map.  It shouldn't be so difficult to differentiate the roads, fields and trees.  I'm going to have to use a marker to better outline the trees, which is something I really shouldn't have to bother with.

Besides a few production issues, though, Psycho Raiders provides an engaging, hilarious, tense, and wholly unique experience.

I was pretty content just to solo this (even though dealing with the hide tokens requires a little bit of finesse, but to my delight I've managed to get this to the table versus actual opponents.  And man, this game is a piece of work.

I'm not generally a fan of watching horror movies (because I'm a wuss) but I love the culture.  And so does Nate Hayden, clearly.  The game is a loving throwback to the magazine games of the 70s, complete with kinda-vague rules and probably too much chrome to really be a great "game."  But who cares?  This is a simulation!  

Kudos to Mr. Hayden for having the balls to embrace that.  If this game was balanced, it wouldn't work.  It's hell to be a camper.  Even if you do manage to shake your pursuers for a little while, you're never safe -- one moment you're feeling like you might make it, the next moment a masked maniac is hacking you apart with a machete.  The art, the radio stations(!), and the overall design create a terrifyingly evocative experience that makes me cringe even as I can't wait to play it again.  It's not for everyone, by a long shot, but if you feel a sick thrill somewhere in your guts upon reading about this game, do yourself a favor and track this down.

Not a huge statement of a game but really does generate atmosphere. Must play in a darkened room with Psycho Radio in the background. Good stuff I'm telling you. A must if you are a Horror junkie.

RATING: 5
I'm glad I tried the game once, but it's not for me. I don't play with anyone that would enjoy playing as campers, so it's more a shelf-stuffer with kitschy components. I had assumed a game of this nature would have tension or suspense, but it felt more like a blend of tedium and inevitability. I'd recommend browsing through the kill cards and calling it a day. Maybe there's possibility for a "Final Girl" variant that would give the campers something interesting to do.

RATING: 7
A hex-and-counter game whose 70's slasher movie theme, and the narrative it generates, reigns supreme.  The art is a bit amatuerish (by design?) in spots, but very evocative of the old-school slasher movie theme.  As in those movies, the game is stacked against the campers who are out-numbered, out-muscled, and out-gunned.  Characters/players will be eliminated from the game.  The gameplay strives for a sandbox openness, but the rules are a bit disorganized and have some loose ends.  But since the game has more than a touch of RPG to it, any loose end rules can be thematically tied up on the fly.  It's a magazine game so the cards need to be cut and most of the charts are on the map.  The magazine also includes a comicbook story to provide a backstory which segues right into the start of the game.  And for even more thematic immersion, there is an online radio (Psycho Raidio) to provide background music and ambient noise!  Can be played with anywhere from 2-12 people and the more the merrier since it is a social and atmospheric game.  When playing with seven each player can take a camper (3) or a raider (4).  I'll sheepishly admit I have never liked slasher movies, but I do like creepy and spooky which this game delivers in spades.  The theme and its presentation certainly isn't for everyone (it comes with an X rating!), but there is no other game like it.

My rating may yet rise!

I was astonished when I first saw a glimpse of this game - how had nobody pointed me in its direction before?

This is an under-the-radar 'video nasty' - with a surprisingly thorough set of rules. If this title had been released in the UK in the 80s, it would have attained cult status by now - and the people who played it branded 'devil worshipers' or worse, I have no doubt.

I don't care if this becomes an 'event' game we only play once a year - its renegade aesthetic earns a place in my collection. Good horror games are way too few.

I have to admit, this game has got under my skin - I haven't been able to stop thinking about it recently. Even going so far as to design an expansion event deck. Make of that what you will.

You should know if this theme will attract or repulse you.  If you can get into it, there is tons of theme here and you end up with a crazy story.  Gameplay is good and the game can be quite tense.  Not balanced, but then this type of game should not be either.

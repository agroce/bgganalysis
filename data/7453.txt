Of the OCS games, this is the least appealing to me I must admit. The play area isn't huge, but the game has a monstrous counter density, somthing OCS typically hasn't been plagued with so much. The situation is interesting, and it's good to have a competant Soviet army on the offensive, tearing up the Germans, but I'm not sure I can bring myself to do the level of micromanagement required by this game.

I own the game. I made the set up. It stayed there for TWO YEARS. I have played big games but this one is intimidating. For committed veterans.

It's an OCS game, a system I am in love with, but it's definately not the best game in that series. It's a slugfest, and due to the counterdensity it is *not* a small game. The soviet player holds the bat and only a competent Nazi can keep him at bay. The game very much favours the soviet player.

A very good OCS game which requires a very special mindset from the axis player to be truly enjoyed.

Overrated...The McDonald's of operational level games. Oh it fills you up and might be satisfying. Just don't look too hard at the actual ingredients.

Note:Good game. Heavy counter density but manageable map size. My rating is more for the OCS but the game is reflective of the entire series.

I've seen comments that this is unplayable, but to me it's the most playable of the monster OCS games, mainly due to the relatively small mapsize which allows it to remain set up for the relatively lengthy periods of time that it takes to play.

RATING: 6.5
The German player is really dangling over the abyss on this one - it is very possible for the Soviets to win quickly near the Dnepr.  Every Axis unit counts!  The Germans will need a strong player to avoid destruction.  I personally like it better as a game than the rating might indicate, but there is no doubt the OB is kind of bogus in light of newer data - the composition of the armies should look more Baltic Gap-ish than CB/GBII-ish.

Great game. Both side have good weapons so you can make huge bloody deadpile. Map size is just 1.5 fullmap, but I suggest 2 players on each side (2vs2). So you can keep the will to fight.

Believe it or not, this makes an excellent introductory game to OCS.

The trick is to make the new players the Soviets. they have lots of toys to play with and can afford to break them (in fact, they *have to* break them in order to break your German toys).

As the teaching player, you take the Germans and you get a challenge - especially if you're working to get the newbie Soviet players up to speed and helping them build solid plans.

When played full-out, it isn't for the faint of heart. It's a slugfest that requires you to create the conditions for operational maneuver, instead of handing you the initial maneuver situation on a plate. Quite the challenge.   :)

high density counter game. Very hard for the german. both side have lots of fine panzer/tank corps units. Nevertheless I have the feeling that some soviet units are overrated.. great game though..
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The concentration of panzer divisions and tank corps in this game is absolutely unique, and you also have the pocket itself to deal with as well as the winter weather.  It's a real strain to play -- gives me a headache just thinking about it, but would still play it again (and again).

Yeah, the counter density is high.  Makes for a very different game than the other OCS titles.  Great slugfest for those with the desire!

RATING: 9
This is my favourite OCS game. It is a monster bloodbath with two equally powerfull enemy mobile formations; however the Germans are totally out of position and the Soviets have a dominance in infantry and artillery. Not for the faint-hearted as the Germans can only survive by being very aggressive. Love it but terrifying!

One of the most-sought after item by the wargamers.  My wargaming friends just grabbed it and gone. Both sides, the German and the Russian, have a lot to do.  It is really a restless game that keeps you coming back for more.

Hube's Pocket covers one of the more chaotic Eastern Front campaigns of WW II with a scenario focusing on each of three major encirclement battles in Ukraine in 1944 along with a campaign covering the whole period.  Rather odd for an OCS game, setup within broad zones is rather free.  This makes setup a crucial part of the strategy.  This is great for competitive game play, but greatly decreases the simulation quality.  My low rating reflects the latter, which is where my interest lies.  I played the Hube's Pocket scenario, probably the one where this issue has greatest impact.  I suspect the campaign game would be better in that respect, allowing one to do decent "what if" experiments.

I played with the OCS 4.2 rules and full errata and found that that worked well with this older game.  Use of the downloadable formation cards was crucial though as the panzer divisions and mech/tank corps would otherwise make unplayably large stack clusters when these two tank-heavy forces grappled.  The materials are near modern OCS standards and held up well over the last 2 decades.

Seems horrendously unbalanced, and after two games we gave up after the 8th and 4th turns, for automatic Soviet wins. However, in speaking with other players I have a lot to learn about how to play this one.

RATING: 9.5
A promising start: many ways to either side and a high density of units on both cards. Hube's Pocket promises to be a great game of OCS.

Un début de campagne prometteur: de nombreux moyens de part et d'autres, une forte densités de pions sur deux cartes. Hube's Pocket s'annonce comme un grand opus d'OCS.

A BIG, high counter-density moster game.  Maybe not the best example of the OCS - too much of a slugfest a the start (see DAK for OCS comments).  Overall, though it&#039;s not a bad game.  Good for teams of 2.

OCS is the way to go for Operational level wargames. That said, I am biased, though. Even if you don't like logistics, one must admit that supply is an important element of warfare. Somewhere along the line, considerations for supply must be included in a wargame of the op level and above.

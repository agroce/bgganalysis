RATING: 8
Let me start here: my wife likes it and she's hard to impress when it comes to games.  After a few games, she concluded "it's really clever".  I concur.  The game is easy to learn but very strategic in how you allocate your cards and their values to create a win condition.  As an added bonus, it plays quickly.  This game is a great appetizer before dinner, or perhaps a dessert afterwards.  And game play is such that children can participate and enjoy it as well.  Recommended.

Best Jason Glover's game I played so far, this was his firts I played that didn't need houserules or discussions about the rules, simple and very efficient mechanics. I enjoyed this game a lot and the playtime is attractive.

very much like Pinata but I actually like this one better. There are some cards with specific moves and adding some of these to the deck changes just the strategy of placing cards on your side or the other. A nice, light two player game.

Kickstarted

I played this twice last night... I'm not sure there is a whole lot of game there. At the end of the second game I had an idea about the 1 and 2 cards, but I wasn't able to convince anyone at the table to play it again.

Totally a sleeper hit with us. I had never even heard of this, but after seeing it recommended in lots of the 2-p. recommendation threads, I took a chance. What a great, simple, but compelling and competitive little game! Hand-management is crucial, as is keeping tabs on what your opponent has played. It is incredibly balanced, as games are often very close, and the tension always ratchets up as you get closer and closer to the end. A brilliant little design, one that the first time I played made me think "why didn't I think of that?"

Fantastic 2 player game! Have played about a dozen times and it has replaced Battle Line and Lost Cities as my two player game of choice. Great artwork and a nice theme. Also, my wife loves it, so that is a HUGE bonus!

Might just replace Battle Line for me... A few more plays of both back to back are needed. For now, great game! I loved the player interaction and unlike some games, never felt "attacked" because of it. Lots of laughs were shared by my wife and I. So if you play with 2, like to puzzle things out, don't mind a little very light conflict, and want to have a good time, try this one out!

Kickstarted this and printed the PnP files.  The cards are gorgeous and learning the game wasn't hard.  We've been enjoying using the special cards.  The only thing we don't like so much are the 3 cards.  They're not really helpful and you can't play them on your opponent, so they often sit in our hands.

I greatly enjoy the 2-player gameplay, the cards interact wonderfully together in conjunction with the theme.  The artwork immerses you in the theme as well.  It's a neat little game and I think it deserves more attention.

Incredibly good two player game. Good short- and long-term planning is key. Easy to teach and plays quickly. Opportunities for reversal of fortune abound. Overall, a great small 2-player game.

This game takes Balloon Cup to the next level. To be fair, it's basically the same game with special ability cards. Those special ability cards, however, are what make this game come alive and soar over its predecessor.

My wife and I quite like this one. It doesn't take long, but has some real strategy. She beats me.

Loving this one for a quicker 2 player game.  Interesting to add in various special cards to see how things change each time.  I think this has a lot of replay value given it can be a different game each time you play.

Two players each represent kingdoms trying to push and pull a series of neutral villages into their sphere of influence, making this an interesting game of competitive diplomacy.

I haven't played Battle Line, but there is game similar called Four Tribes is awesome two player game.

Players have the same base deck of cards, but then can add up to five unique cards. The players represent warring factions who need to convince a bunch of village elders from the four tribes to join their cause, in order to tip the scale in their favor. How do you convince them? Bribery, of course! During the game, players will be laying down all manner of goodies at the feet of the village elders to sway them. And if that doesn’t work? Unleash a Dragon to sabotage the other player’s efforts!

Rebuttal for Five Tribes jokes/comments: Ah,  for cryin’ out loud. That’s the the stinking, most awful, stupid joke and you’re always pullin’ that stinking awful stupid joke. You don’t want in this thing, you don’t get in this thing. Oddball In Kelly's Heroes.

Battle Line variant with some twists, such as that coloured cubes indicate which colour cards can be played adjacent to each battleground and that low-numbered cards can be played on the opponent's side. Winning at a village takes the elder there; the win condition is having all three elders of one colour or one of each, so upsets are possible.

The Sanctuary cards seem significantly overpowered, but the game otherwise works well.

One of my favourite two player games. Quick to learn, love the theme, and a round is under 30 minutes.

Got my copy of the game in the mail today 8/6/14!! My wife and I have been playing all evening and it is a fantastic 2 player game. So glad I backed this project.

I think this is a better deep-thinkers version of Pinata.  Love the look and feel.  I really like the thinning of the deck and tightening of play with the second edition.  Definitely an improvement!

Fun 2 player game, but you need to limit the amount of power cards in the deck to around 3, or else it get's redonkulous.

One of my earlier Kickstarters and a game I thought looked cool.  However I have similar style games and didn't think I'd be able to get it to the table.

Use cards with varying effects to win over village elders. Very interesting head to head with identical decks. Involves bluffing, counting and quite a fair bit of underhandedness.
very enjoyable lunch-hour game

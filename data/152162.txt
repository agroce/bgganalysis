We played and it really sucked for me. Just felt like those with lucky deals (great cards or lots to throw away) got lots of points and mediocre hands were left with few decisions and fewer points.  Felt like many layers of luck and few decision points.

A trick taking game with a lifecycle.  I like how winning a trick may not do anything for you because you don't fulfill the prerequisites to make it work (eg not having a gem in front of your shield to put behind the shield).

RATING: 6
Simple trick-taking game where if you play off suit, you get to move victory points around in the form of 'diamonds' (transparent crystal). They move from the front of your 'safe' into your safe - sometime directly, sometimes from your opponents. Play was as you'd expect - even passing 1-3 cards to your left before you start the hand. So no surprises really, but some nice twists in the off suit play. I liked it well enough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Now here is a trick taking game I enjoyed more than I could have ever imagined just from reading the rules. In an average trick taking game, half of your choices are obvious. In Diamonds however, every choice seemed to count. This is achieved with the mechanics that allows you to take special actions when not following suit. Simply ingenious. You can actually contribute to the game and make meaningful decisions even when you can see that there is no way to win the trick.

Diamonds were indeed not forever this time. This game is like coke zero. I tried it 6 times because I wanted it to live up to the hype but ultimately it just wasn't a good experience. Clearly the diamonds are the best suit, the other suits aren't that great in terms of the powers they grant, and while the components are nice the game just isn't as good as other trick taking games in my collection. I've moved on.

Didn't like the take-that interaction of constantly being stolen from. Finished 4th due to being victimized for having a big pile out of my vault -- yet others had far more in their vault. 

Also a bit counterintuitive on when to play certain cards, and heavily depends on luck of the draw.

Nice trick taking game that, despite being new, has a classic/old game vibe. A player plays a suit and who can follow ir must do so, if you arent able you can play a different suit and perform its action, but can't win the hand, the highest card of the trump wins the hand and whoever played it perform the suit's action and keep the cards to gain a bonus in the end of the round.

RATING: 6
A standard trick taker with a twist.  While winning tricks is rewarded, playing cards that are not of the suit led can be more rewarding.  That is particularly true of diamonds, that allow a gem to be placed safely behind your screen, scoring two points instead of one for a front of screen gem.  This is quite an interesting twist, but it seems to me that the multitude of ways of acquiring gems does slacken this game's tension.

Production quality of the cards is very good and they have a handsome Art Deco look, as one would hope for the price asked.

Excellent as a two player game. (One downside, I find the cards very hard to read because of the poor design)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
An interesting take on standard trick-taking that adds the element for the players winning the hand to collect, move or steal gems, but also for players who off-suit to also perform an action immediately, which keeps you engaged throughout the round.  Once you get the four basic actions down, the game moves along at a good pace, albeit slower then normal trick-taking games.

The only things I didn't like was the card design - the symbols weren't clear enough against the darkened background and the fact the whole deck isn't used, making it impossible to keep track of all the cards.  The former could be addressed by using standard poker cards and the latter by using all the cards each turn, or separating values out as you do in euchre.

The game plays well and the gems add a small additional layer - it's good, but after just 2 plays I'm not 100% sure it is THE trick-taking game I'm seeking.

A respectable, nicely designed variant on trick taking games.  When you are short in a suit, you can play any one of your cards, and that suit has a special "diamond gathering" or "diamond transferring" effect in the game. The goal is to collect as many diamonds as possible, and at the end of the game, they are either scored as one if they are in front of your diamond vault, or as two if they are in your vault.

Some interesting ideas, and some interesting play, but not enough to make me want to play it again.  Bottom line:  I am not sure I would play this game over standard hearts, which is perhaps its closest competitor.

If you are looking for a different take on trick taking card games this might be the game you are looking for.  You are diamond dealers and you have two locations for your diamonds.  First the showroom.  Diamonds here are worth a point each at the end of the game but it is dangerous leaving diamonds here as they can be stolen by other players.  Then there is the vault.  Diamonds here can not be stolen and are worth two points each.  This plays much like hearts but with a twist.  The player who takes a trick gets to perform that suits special ability.  At the end of the round whoever has the most of a suit in their take gets to take that suits action.  I love hearts but would play this over hearts any day.

Because of how easy it is to win tricks or get special actions I don't enjoy this game as much.

I do think the plastic jewels adds to its attractiveness with casual gamers.

I like trick taking games and I like games that are easy to teach and will work for lots of players.  This ticks those spots although I only like the game rather than love.  I like the card powers, I like the power of getting to get power actions for a) winning a trick, b) playing off-suit c) if you dont win a trick in a round and d) for having the most of a suit in your trick pile - but at the end of the day I want something a bit deeper or more different although there is still a decent amount to the game.

This one isn't bad, but it didn't wow me either. I'd play it again, but won't seek it out. The game itself if a fun little trick taking game with a twist in that you can take actions if you win the trick or have the majority of a certain suit at the end of the round. Personally I prefer Bargain Hunter, but if you don't have a trick taking game in your collection to teach non-gamers, this wouldn't be a bad option. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A twist on the tried-and-true trick taking genre. Rather than points, you now have plastic diamonds worth either 1 or 2 points each depending if they are in front or behind your shield. Anyone that's played Hearts or Spades can be taught this game in 2 minutes which makes it a solid option for a casual gaming group. For gamers, it's pretty light. I like the tactile aspect of grabbing and moving diamonds around the table and it also negates the need for pen and paper. In the end I think I prefer Hearts as it gives you an entirely different way to earn points by "shooting the moon" which this game lacks. However, the game is more flexible by having a 60-card deck that allows for up to 6 players and a couple variants on how to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Interesting trick-taking card game. I wouldn't put it up there with the likes of Euchre, as I had heard, but a fun game nonetheless. Easy to teach, but can take some time to remember the actions of each suit. Isn't making it to the table near as much as I had thought, and that's because it just isn't as good as advertised. Still, a keeper.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.25
Good trick taking game with an extra layer of strategy thrown on top. Knowing which off suit to play for which special ability makes this a little more thinky than say, Hearts or Euchre. We played twice back to back with our neighbors, who also really enjoyed it. Keeper! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Really clever trick taking game that rewards you for not being able to follow suit. There are also rewards for not taking tricks and leading in certain suits, giving this game a lot of variable strategy. Do you want to get rid of the only two cards you have in a suit, just so you can not follow suit later on? Do you want to try for the majority in a certain suit? Which suit effects are most attractive to you? Fun, engaging, and balanced gameplay in a trick taker that presents some fabulous twists. Looking forward to future plays.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
I usually like trick taking games, so I actually went into this one thinking I would REALLY like it.. but I kind of thought it was "Eh".  Being able to play out of suite really seems to be the key in this one, and it's something you have no control over.  The special powers were interesting, but didn't wow me.  I also didn't really like the memory element of the hidden scoring.  I'll probably play this a few more times, just to make sure I am not missing something, but so far I was not all that impressed. 

UPDATE:
I did play one rule wrong previously.  We forgot to have the dealer decide how many cards would be passed before starting a round (so we were never passing cards). I got a chance to play this 2p, and it was actually pretty fun.  Still not going to keep this one, as I just have other things I'd rather play.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A new (to me) type of trick-taking card game in which each trick won gives the winner an instant special ability based on the suit that was led.  Additionally, when you cannot follow suit, you get an instant bonus (special ability) based on the sit of the card you played.  There are no trump suits, no target (high points) cards, and the number of tricks won doesn't matter; the goal is to have the most points in gems acquired through special abilities earned.  Since it is more than a plain trick-taking game, I prefer Diamonds to other games in this genre; however, ultimately, I'm not sure Diamonds is well-balanced because you can end up in a rut of useless actions based on the luck of the suits dealt to you.

The game has the familiarity of Hearts, but with an added twist. Every time you win a suit or have to play off-suit, you may use the corresponding action of that color. Goal is to fill your vault with gems. The actions give you options to choose from (do I deliberately want to loose suits so i can play off-colors or do I want to deny specific colors to others by forcing them to play them). One of my go-to tricktaking games at the moment, especially with casual gamers.

Holy crap a NEW trick taker? How long has it been since someone's released one of those!

I really love this genre so there is a strong bias working for me here. I think this is a pretty fun game if you've already got a solid collection of trick takers and are looking for something a little different to play now and then, but this would definitely not be the first one I'd point people to.

The biggest difference to me here from most trick takers is that there's some unpredictability in the card distribution, as unless you're playing with max players (I've not tried that yet) you're NOT dealing out all the cards every hand. Card counting becomes less of an essential skill, and instead it feels sometimes a little more like pushing your luck. I'm not really sure how I feel about this. It sort of feels like a trick taker with one of the biggest strategies removed.

The unique selling point in Diamonds are the suit actions that you can take when you either play offsuit or win a trick. This can make for some clever little choices sometimes, but often it's pretty straightforward. Because there's less predictability in card distribution, you can get hands that just suck for scoring points.

It's also one of those games where you want to take it all or take nothing, but I'm not sure there's actually any real creative plays you can make to achieve either; you're either dealt a hand that will win a ton of tricks or you're dealt a hand that won't win any. Or, obviously, you're dealt an in-between hand and there's not much you can do about it.

So, yeah, it's got some clever ideas but ultimately it feels like you're more at the mercy of the hand you're dealt here than with other trick takers. But, it's also pretty short for a trick taker so I can see this getting some play despite that!

PS: The card art is great but why have the black border around the cards? It just makes holding your cards such that you can see all of the numbers more difficult than it ought to be.

An innovatively bad game.  I love trick-taking card games, and the early descriptions of this game sounded amazing. There aren't many standard trick-takers that have special actions, and none that I know give you actions when you sluff.  However,  in practice, you realize quickly that the simple system employed provides absolutely no strategy.  You try to maximize your number of actions, but that is totally the whim of whom is leading the trick.  The last thing you really want is to be in the lead. So you limit yourself to as few suits as you can and hope that the other players lead the others. Add in the horrible card art, and you have yourself a giant stinker...very sad.

Love card games - kind of hated Diamonds. 

I get what the designer was going for,  getting rid of the useless and automatic sloughs inherent to many trick-taking games. But the actions themselves are bizarrely out of balance, with diamonds requiring one action to get two points, and the others all one action for one point. I get it's called Diamonds but... And the bonus for taking no tricks is laughably small so that is also not viable. Compare that to Hearts where shooting the moon, or the threat of it, looms large over every hand. 

Also, I found there were no interesting decisions to be made in the cardplay (at least that I could find - I could be missing something). All plays seemed automatic, at least to anyone who has ever played cards before. I was never thinking about how to construct the hand in a way that would pay off later in the deal. Just a lot of plays for short-term gain. Even in silly card games there is usually some interesting hand-management. 

And I hated the king-making bash-the leader mechanism of stealing from other players. 

Plus, this can absolutely be played with a regular deck of cards and it seems awfully silly to buy this game. The cardstock does not shuffle well, and the gems make it way overpriced. 

Vastly inferior to both Hearts and Spades (and Clubs for that matter!)

The games reminds me of spades. I played a lot of spades when I was younger and found Diamonds to add a twist to spades. There's nothing here that "wows" me, but diamonds is entertaining enough to fit in as a light filler or a game to play with the family. I have only played it with 2 and I imagine the game better with more players. There is a more strategic variant that I have yet to play. I can see this fitting into my collection nonetheless because it is so easy to pick up and play.

Fairly simple trick taking game with the twist being that when you sluff off cards, you get to take an action based on the suit. It's all very much random and most if the time you don't have a lot of choices to make, but there is something neat going on that I think could make a fairly cool mechanic in some other game someday.

RATING: 6
Pretty standard trick-taker.  Follow suit, highest card wins the trick.  The neat aspect is the special function based on the suit.  What you win with allows you to move Diamonds (VPs) from Spot A to Spot B: from the supply/showroom/other's showroom to your showroom/vault.  Playing off suit also grants those abilities so you are actually relieved to cast off cards. After each round,t eh person collecting the most of each suit gets that action once again. So lots of moving Diamonds in the game.

The flaw I think is that vault (safe) Diamonds are worth 2 VP while showroom (at risk) Diamonds end up at 1 VP.  While it takes a bit of manipulating to get Diamonds in the safety of your vault, they can't be touched which makes it hard to catch up to any perceived leader.  Meanwhile there is a lot of stealing going on with Showroom Diamonds that tends to harm those already doing a poor job of safeguarding the higher value Diamonds.

It might be better to score those at higher points since that is the higher risk.  So banking guarantees a lesser value to give you a more interesting decision.

This game has, for me, replaced: Spades, Euchre, and Hearts. I would much prefer this trick taking game over each of those listed. All the suits are involved and not just 1 or 2 this time. I get the feel of Spades and Hearts mostly with the act of throwing off suit and trying to go Nil in certain situations. A great way to build upon ancient card games.

Box is ridiculously too big, I'm confused why they changed the basic poker deck to numbers 1-15 instead of keeping the traditional ranks, the suit symbol changes were largely detrimental though useable, the graphic design of the faces of the cards hurts readability. Design-wise, it seems like the spade action is substantially weaker and the diamond action substantially stronger such that the randomness of the deal is difficult to overcome in those two suits. It is an interesting idea and has some fun, but ultimately pales in comparison to Tichu, Hearts, and Bridge. I'd even rather play Wizard.

I've always loved Rook and Hearts, etc. Trick taking games are a big passion of my otherwise non-gamer family. I found Diamonds to be a satisfying twist on the classic genre. It only took a few tricks to get the hang of the different suit abilities. I love the little plastic gems. I only wish they would re-do the artwork on the cards. I played a random game with face cards and the gems/tents from Incan Gold (worked really, really well) and I was really satisfied with how clear and straightforward the suits were on the basic playing cards. Clean it up! I might even buy it again.

Our FLGS encouraged me to try this, knowing that I like card games and come from a trick-taking family. The art deco style is beautiful, the gems are cool, and the safe is neat. So I gave it a go.

This is indeed very much like most trick-taking games you're used to - someone leads a suit, if you have a card in that suit you have to play it, otherwise you play another card. The twist here is you get rewarded for which suit you "play off" and also the trick-winner gets rewarded for the suit they won the trick in. Each suit has a special power, with Diamonds being the best. You have a "showroom" in front of your safe which scores you points at the end of the game, and a safe whose gems score you double points.

Super easy to learn and completely ideal if you're into trick-taking games. The advertising here is spot-on - if you like Hearts or Spades, you need to try Diamonds. My only criticism is the art makes some of the card values a little hard to read at first glance. There's some big empty space in the middle of each card which could have been utilized.

MANY hours of Spades and Hearts played growing up, and later Tichu, led to me automatically wanting to play Diamonds.  It's a fresh take on the genre for me.  I quite enjoy it, as I know distinctly when it will be over.  I can plan the start and finish of this one.  And if my Diamonds game box is not within reach, a regular deck of cards, a few cups, and some coins will do the trick nicely.  A promising potential classic for my household.

As of 2017:
Most people who even play trick-taking and/or climbing card games already have a preferred title, and it generally involves a good old deck of cards.  Despite being fun, this one is not universally known, has a unique deck, and requires extra components.  It's fun, but since it only gets played as "Care to try a new trick-taking game," and then not by the same people thereafter, apparently it's not fun enough.

I grew up playing Pinochle and Euchre and this may be the partnership/trick-taking game that gets me back to my roots. It definitely works with 2p, but I have a hunch it's going to shine with 4. 

In normal trick-taking games you lead into your partner's strength. In this one you will probably want to lead into your partner's short suits to score their diamonds, particularly if you can still win the trick by doing so. 

I'm looking forward to more plays.

*Not sure this really needs a special deck. Even with 6p you could just play 8 tricks instead of 10. The plastic diamonds are really nice however.

RATING: 6
This game was debuted to the group with mixed reviews. My reaction was not too favorable, but others liked it. 

I think that everyone agreed the graphic design choices were a little frustrating. The large border makes you have to really spread out your cards to read them in your hand. And the black border makes nicks easily visible. Plus the numbers and suits don’t really stand out very well from the background, so glancing at the trick is not very easy.
 
The game itself is solid, but (for me) it’s missing the two things that make trick-taking games fun -> bidding and taking tricks. OK, so there is trick-taking in this game, but it’s not that important, so it really dampens the excitement of winning the trick. Basically, the game feels very mechanical to me with no sense of excitement until the final points are scored. 

The only "fun" for me in the game is stealing diamonds from other players. However, because you don’t know who is in the lead (unless you’re paying more attention that I’m willing to), I typically just steal randomly from another player, who then steals back from me, and it turns into a diamond stealing feud. I only call that "fun" because it at least allows for some table talk. 

On the plus side, once everyone knows what the card actions are, the game can be played quickly, without much thought, which allows for casual conversation. However, until that point, it can be a fairly quiet game, except for repeated questions about what card does what. 

NOTE: I was playing with my parents, who aren't really gamers. However, they are quite experienced card players, so I was disappointed that the off-suit card action mechanic didn't really transition that well for tranditional card players.

RATING: 7
Interesting trick-taking game. Winning tricks and shedding cards earns points during the hand; at the end, taking the most of a suit or taking no cards are rewarded.

Obviously, this influences the play in two simple directions; taking no cards with lots of shedding or taking lots of tricks. But I suspect the game allows for some mix; taking many cards in a suit with lots of shedding seems potentially viable depending on your hand.

There's an additional layer, too; each suit offers variable and distinct payoffs, adding to the calculation. The sum is an interesting little trick-taker that deserves more play (even though card games aren't my favorite).

There's one almost certain downside, though. One suit offers direct targetting, which seems relatively pointless in the context of the game. It's possible that the game offers enough control to stash gems behind screens when in the lead, but my initial play leads me to doubt it. I won't judge too harshly prematurely, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A good entry into the family-weight trick-taking genre.   It seems a bit too fiddly at first, since almost every trick results in 2-3 suit actions, but it quickly becomes second nature.  As you get more skilled, you learn how to build your hand towards the type of actions you want to happen, and defend against other players stealing your gems.   Simple, clever, and fast.   Grandma can play.

GenCon 2014 demo.  If they get the pricing right, Stronghold probably has another winner with Diamonds.  Takes a minute to learn (rules are in the description), and a bit of luck.  It's more that it's interesting to see who ends up winning rather than trying to master this game because there's certainly luck there.  Out of 60 cards (4 suits x 15 each), perhaps only 40 are in play (in a 4-player game) so you can't count cards as you can in, say, pinochle.  This means you are leading with some cards out of the game.  Hence more fun rather than seriously competitive.

This is a trick-taker that sounds so simple, I wonder why it hasn't been thought of before. Each suit confers a power when you win it. The point here being to get diamonds either in front of your screen (1 pt) or better yet, behind it (2 pts). You can grab diamonds from other players and place them in front of your screen.

What makes it more interesting is that when you are out of the lead suit, you may play another suit and get that benefit. This means you frequently want to rid yourself of a suit or suits so you can be free to play other suits and take those actions. Moreover, if you don't win any suits during a round, you get 2 diamonds behind your screen. Before each round, the dealer decides to pass 1 to 3 cards. Once the light goes on that you may not want to win any tricks at all and use non-lead suit cards for actions, the game opens up into cross-incentivized players playing to win or lose each round.

It all works extremely well even with 6P. Highly recommended for lovers of trick takers.

Trick taking card game with a pile of gems instead of pen & paper points.  Easy rules--learn & play in minutes.  Several avenues of strategy.  Should be my kind of game.

Strategy in passing (often hearts, the weakest suit), playing on void suits, taking tricks quickly to flush out a suit, or not taking any tricks at round end for the diamond reward.  With all those opportunities for strategy, still seems like too much luck with cards dealt.  

I like the pile of gems,  but that is overshadowed by flimsy vaults that fall over & expose hidden gems behind the screen, cards too dark on both sides that confuse dealers & players alike, and numbers that should be larger to stand out more, especially since the cards are so dark on both sides.

As I am sitting here writing this, I cant help but reflect on the game and think of how well it will work in so many situations. Yes, its very traditional feeling...but thats what is wonderful about it. If you like classic trick taking games, you will like this. In some odd way, it reminded me of Split.

Fun, feels like a classic trick taking game, but more fun and more exciting.  Felt like I had to bump the rating down slightly because I just can't get my card game loving family excited about this one, and they were my target audience. Still, it's a hit with others I've played with.

I love Mike Fitzgerald's foray into trick-taking card games a la Hearts and Spades. The actions you can take in off-suits provide that little extra something that is missing from typical games of this ilk, as they make nearly every card matter. Although I liked the inviolability of the player vaults, I didn't care for the way they shield the gems. I feel playing with vaults that opponents can see into (but not take from) would make for a much more engaging and competitive game.

I feel like abstracts should have little to no hidden information.  This has no theme and yet you are just guessing at what others might have.  You don't use all the cards so you can get royally screwed depending on what you are dealt and what you count.  And basically I hate diamonds in general.  False markets and exploitation of people/countries aren't my kind of things.

I like the idea of this game quite a bit and it's easy to teach, but the game unfortunately feels extremely unbalanced. Essentially, the diamonds are just too good. Every game we've played of this has simply gone to the person who has drawn the most of that suit. Might try a variant of making the diamonds act like your choice of a heart or spade to add some strategy back in but not sure it's worth it or not.

Diamonds is a nice little hand management, trick-taking game, where players try to grab and cache as many VP as possible.
A VP action takes place either when you win a trick, or when you are able to play off suit- so maximizing winners is not necessarily as important as your short suits.
Different suits have different VP actions, but maximizing VP by getting more actions is the basic key.
Diamonds is straight forward enough that even w the VP actions, anyone knowing trick-taking games should be able to enjoy it.

RATING: 9
Simple enough to get just about anyone to play (unlike the ladder climbing games) and with lots of subtle decision making. The constant tactile aspect of the game is a really nice element. It works surprisingly well as a two-player game also. I'd just assume not play the perfect information variant because I don't believe it'd play all that much differently, and even if my memory were that good, the surprise of what's out there is half the fun. There are a few more twists than in a typical trick taker as a result of the interactions and combos of the different suite actions.

My only real complaint is that the suite action iconography could have been better (and been printed on the inside of the player shields). The actions can definitely be memorized after a single game at most, but there seems to be confusion about the actions at first.

Update: After playing Diamonds at different player counts and with different groups, I'm very satisfied with my rating. There is something about this game that people seem drawn to. It's a great holiday/family game that people actually suggest playing (usually I'm the one suggesting). 

I think it's worth noting that Diamonds is great at two players, but it's very different strategically. The two player variant makes for combinations of the actions that simply aren't possible at higher counts. I would say the game is more thoughtful, strategic, and tactical at two. I'm not sure I like Diamonds better at two (it's more fun with ~5), but I certainly appreciate the option for a quieter, less chaotic experience.

Rating is provisional based on one play, and maybe we missed something, but this game seems completely scripted with few real decisions. I don't understand the appeal of this over Hearts.

Update: Reading some other comments here and reviews and now I'm convinced I'm missing something. People talk about the depth of this game, but I didn't see it at all, which makes me think our game was very unusual or we played it incorrectly. Pulling my rating until I can try it again.

My first play was two-player with "Perfect" setup. This was not good. Some rounds we knew how the entire thing was going to go the moment we got our cards. Usually we knew how the 2 or 3 tricks had to be played. I don't think I'm ever going to play with a perfect setup again for two. That being said, I can see how it's interesting to play with this setup when there are 4 or more players. I am looking forward to trying it again with a random setup with my wife. As I suspected, it's not as interesting as [thing=37628][/thing], but it has potential.

I grew up on trick-taking games and generally find them very comforting.  Diamonds captures this very well. It adds special abilities for each suit; this is enough of a change to make things slightly more interesting while still being simple enough to retain the trick-taking feel and also appeal to a wide audience. 

There's a lot to think about in the game and I think that it would be possible to get very good at it--of course, it's still a card game and a lot depends on the draw, but card counting could be..really good. 

Anyway, good stuff. (1 play)

A charming little trick-taking game in which each suit can grant you a special action when a card is played off-suit or is the trick-winning card.  This adds a whole layer to the card selection process and somewhat mitigates a bad hand.  The only problem is that one of the actions is useless without having taken one of the other ones first, meaning if you get a lot of that suit in the first round you won't be making much progress.

I have limited experience with "trick taking" games, but Diamonds is a very well produced card game with an innovative game mechanism that leads to the players making a lot of interesting decisions - like "should I intentionally attempt to 'lose' this hand just to get X benefit." 

I'm really enjoying this game and look forward to more.

RATING: 6
Diamonds is Hearts for modern gamers. It adds enough new twists with minimal additional complexity to create some genuinely interesting decisions, in particular the question as to how to score points: either trying to take as many tricks as possible or playing off-suit frequently and avoiding tricks.

There is still a non-trivial amount of luck (especially when an opponent happens to keep playing cards that force on-suit play with low-numbered cards), but give Mike Fitzgerald credit: he made a game that should make everyone never want to play Hearts again.

Initial Rating: 5.5 (January 2017)

There was a time I loved trick-taking games (I still like Wizard) but I no longer do, still, I had some fun playing Diamonds.

The rules are very easy to teach, you can do it under 5 minutes, playtime is around 30 minutes. 

The game´s components are very well done, the diamonds look gorgeous on the table and the cards themselves have a neat back and have a good card stock quality.

The core trick taking game’s rules are in effect, but Diamonds also add powers if you win a trick or if you don´t follow the lead card, that’s neat! The goal of the game is to amass the greater amount of diamonds in and outside your vault. Unlike most trick taking games, this one has a “take that” element as you can steal diamonds from other players. I’m still not sure how I feel about this.
 
Best with 4 players.

I have played the game twice now, so I’m still not sure how much luck affects the game. It could be that the suits themselves are unbalanced. I need more plays to verify but on the whole, I don’t care much about that because it plays so fast!

Bottom line, Diamonds is among the best trick taking games I have played, but still it isn’t a game for me. It is a perfect game to play with the family or with non-gamers. If you like trick taking games you should like the game. It is much better than Clubs. I already sold my copy of the game but I would play again if requested.

Diamonds does something pretty special, taking a trick-taking game and giving players powers when they can not match suit or if they win the most cards of a suit.  This alone takes what would be a pretty standard trick-taker and elevates it to one of my favorites.  Good stuff here and beautiful components as well.

Really just a point salad card game. You get something no matter what you do, so it feels like a Feld, where there doesn't seem to be enough of a reason to pursue one strategy over another unless you're playing at an expert level, and I never foresee investing the effort to get there.

A good trick-taking game, plus it's more fun, fast, and interactive than many.

You can play with a standard deck, aces high.  Use ~50 pennies (or cubes, beads, chips, etc.), plus a few nickels or dimes.

To play with 6 players (3 teams of 2) with a standard deck, add the 2 jokers and deal 9-card hands.  The jokers are trumps:  You may play a joker if you can't follow suit.  Your joker wins the trick; you take the action of the trick's suit.  (Red joker beats black joker.)

12-01-2014 - Quick card trick game that incorporates gems for scoring.  Taking tricks and such isn't enough, you gather the gems by winning tricks, stealing form other players, and other means.  A refreshing twist on this type of game.  I'm not all in, but my wife loved it as she's more into card games than I am.  6 for me, probably a 8+ for her.

01-09-2015 - After some more time with this I like it even better.  Up to a 7.  I'm not real big on card-only games, but this one does have some strategy to it, and it's quick enough to not get monotonous.

Great way of implementation on trick taking.  It seems to be better to have worse cards and only a couple of suits to really get synergy.  Like that element of it.  At times it is very difficult to have the lead since you will most likely not get to do an action.

Really like this one.

Diamonds is a trick-taking card game in which players collect Diamonds — not cards bearing that suit, mind you, but rather actual "Diamond Crystals" (acrylic crystals) included in the game.

What makes the game of Diamonds different from other trick-taking card games is that when you cannot follow suit you get a "Suit Action" based on what suit you do play. Suit Actions are also taken by the winner of each trick, as well as at the end of a full Round of play.

Suit Actions will enable players to take Diamond Crystals from the Supply, moving them to their Showroom (where they may score 1 point) or to their Vault (where they will score 2 points). The Vault is a secure area, but the Showroom is vulnerable to theft by the other players.

I'm not going to rush out and purchase this one, but it is a pretty solid trick taker.  I just have too many other trick taking games that I'd still prefer to play over this one.  Easy rules, easy play and it works well two player.  The unique concept in the game is that there are four special actions that can be taken dependent upon suit - and you get to take one any time you are forced to play a card out of suit, win a trick in a suit with highest card, and have won the most cards in a suit at the end of the round.

For being called the Pocket Line, I certainly have no idea how that box will fit into a pocket!  :-)

An okay trick tacking game, but seems more like gamey editions to a trick tacking game than a well thought out game. I am sucker for trick tacking games but this one just sort of fell flat on me. It also is very dependent upon the cards you draw what actions you can take throughout the game. Overall I would rather play about 10 other trick tacking games before this one, but it isn't a bad game by any stretch of the imagination.

Decent game. The corner numbers aren't close enough to the card edge for easy viewing while in your hand. Requires fanning them out more than is usual with regular playing cards, which can be tiresome. Nice gems included with the game. I prefer the team play variant.

I really enjoy trick-taking games. There's been a recent trend in them to complicate them up by having every card have a special power or represent multiple values or whatever, so it's nice to see one that is pretty straightforward. I don't know why it doesn't just use a regular deck dealt all the way out, though.

This is a trick-taking game that you really can put in front of people who play traditional trick-takers (particularly those who know Hearts, Oh Heck, or other games where you deliberately slough off cards) and not have them freak out.

The balance of playing to win tricks (control your choice of actions, draw off opponents' cards, gain the end-round bonus actions) vs playing to lose them (taking an off-suit action without requiring a good card, bonus end-round actions if you go null) is good. What you can't afford is to get stuck in a hand where you're always following suit but unable to get the lead.

One knock: the font sacrifices some clarity for ambiance, as do the suit icons. Reading your hand is fine, but reading the cards on the table can be more work than necessary

RATING: 7
A fun trick taking game where you are trying to collect diamonds and put them into your vault or in front of you vault.  Diamonds allow you to put a diamond in the supply directly into your vault.  Hearts put cards in front of your vault, spades put a card in front of your vault into your vault, and clubs allow you to take one diamond from in front of another persons vault.  

Diamonds in your vault are 2 points, in front are 1 point.  Most points wins.  

A very accessible family friendly game.  The card quality is not that great.  It should have linen finish and does not.  If you play a lot of times, the cards will become "sticky".  But other than that, a fine game.

Diamonds is a nice trick taking game with a twist. Great for non gamers as it is basically a traditional card game with a special power for taking a trick, the game has a bit of strategy for not being able to follow suit to get bonuses, or to not take a trick in a round.

Phenomenal trick taking game!  It plays odd and even number players.  It gives you the option to play free-for-all or partners.  The addition of special suite powers puts this game over the top.

Me gusta mucho las acciones de las cartas, las que se dan por tener la mayoría de cartas de algún palo y que hayan puesto una acción especial si no ganaste ningún trick.

Makes me nostalgic for old-school trick-taking games, but is different enough and has enough replayability that I consider this an instant classic.

I like the idea of trick-taking games, but they're generally not my first choice to play.  They tend to favor experienced players so it's hard to introduce new players, plus I just have a hard time getting my head around any solid strategy.  With that in mind, I really tend to enjoy this game.  I love the constant reward for playing off-suit as well as for winning tricks.  It's also interesting that not all of the suits are always helpful to you, which varies your strategy through the game.  The four suit actions make for some interesting play and make it difficult to really keep track of who's winning.  Definitely one I will happily continue to play.

Disappointed in this one... had high expectations, and maybe that is the issue.

There were not enough decisions per minute to keep me interested - many hands can just be played on autopilot.  It seemed like the "pass 1,2, or 3" mechanic was not enough to allow me to short-suit myself so that I could leverage the off-suit actions.  Luck in the card draw was too significant of a factor.

Played with 6 players - so all of the cards were in play. 
 Maybe this would have more tension and be more enjoyable with 4 or 5.

RATING: 8
Diamonds is a trick taking game with a great twist to make it stand out from the trick-taking pack. 

The basic rules of trick-taking are in play (follow suit where possible, play anything else when you can't) but their are 2 main change-ups. 

First, each of the suits has an associated action. If a player wins a trick by following suit then they get that action. If they are able to play off-suit they get that action immediately. 

The second change-up is that the players are trying to get diamonds into their collection from the supply. But there are two locations that diamonds can be held. Diamonds in your showroom are worth 1 point but these can be stolen by other players via one of the suit actions. The other location is your vault and any diamonds transferred to here are worth 2 points and are protected. 

The game unfolds over a number of rounds with the players trying to acquire diamonds from the supply and getting them into their vault. At the same time they are also trying to steal diamonds from the open showrooms of the other players. 

But all of this must be done whilst still playing a trick-taking game. The players must also give away between 1-3 cards at the start of each round (dealer's choice) and this allows players to try and manipulate their hand to short-suit themselves and the like. 

This is a Mike Fitzgerald Game (Mystery Rummy and Baseball Highlights 2045 fame) so I am not surprised it is a great design.

A must have for my collection.

I judged it harshly on a first play with 3 but came around on a second play with 2 (note: second time was as a side game during a slow-ish Aqua Sphere session). It's far from the upper echelon of card games, but I can accept that Diamonds scratches a specific card game itch.

Gioco che riprende le regole del tressette e ci aggiunge qualche elemento scenico tipo i simpatici diamanti e la cassaforte dove accumularne. Oltre alle tradizionali regole del famoso gioco di carte qui si aggiunge un draft iniziale, e la possibilità di vincere non solo quando ci si aggiudica una mano ma anche quando si riesce a non rispondere al seme corretto. Ogni seme poi è abbinato ad un azione particolare che permette appunto di acquisire, rubare o stivare diamanti. Un semplice gioco di carte carino e veloce.

I like trick-taking games. A lot. Diamonds is essentially a regular ol' trick-taking game with an ordinary, standard deck of cards. The only differences is that you're collecting gems and the cards go up to 15. This one is cool because the twist is that each suit has a special ability. That's so simple it's pure genius.

[b]Diamonds[/b]

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]Along with Parade, Diamonds has become the go to card game when my dad, son and I get together. I love classic card games, my dad and I have played hundreds of games of Cribbage) so I was happy to introduce my dad to a new trick taker that he enjoyed right away. Diamonds takes familiar mechanics from those games and creates a brilliant trick taker that is infinitely replayable. The ability to take a suit action if you can't follow the lead is what really makes Diamonds shine and makes it worth seeking out. In my opinion an instant classic; if you like classic card games or trick takers in general you owe it to yourself to play Diamonds.[/i]

 [COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8/10):[/COLOR]

[i]- Amazing artwork and graphic design, I love the art deco style.
- A fresh take on the trick taking genre, if you don't follow the suit led you get to take the special action granted by the card you played.
- As the dealer you get to decide how many cards [i](1 to 3)[/i] to pass leading to some creative play since you don't always know what your final hand will look like.
- There is a lot of player interaction since you are constantly stealing diamonds from other players and then trying to vault them before the same happens to you.

I am looking forward to getting this game and playing with my dad and son. I can see this being in the rotation with Parade.[/i]

A nice variant on hearts, with players accumulating to different values of plastic diamonds for scoring. 

The game provides the standard four suits, but cards are numbered 1-15, and when someone can't stay with the suit of choice, that person gets to use a different suit's special ability to potentially claim diamonds--either from an opponent or a bank, or to move them from one place to a more secure one. But ultimately the person who wins the most tricks will end up accumulating the most diamonds. 

Players play a set number of rounds depending up the total number of players. There are also special two-player rules. Just a really solid variant of a standard game--to me in the same way "Mystery Rummy" is a variant on rummy that makes a familiar game more interesting. 

I had read a lot of great things about this game and wanted to get something new that my wife and non-gamer friends might play. In May of 2015 I taught the game to my sister, who liked it. 

Purchased February 2015.

Great trick-taking game for veteran and new gamers alike. Very easy to learn and play.

Also, the partner/team variations offer more replayability, too. Great addition to my shelf. Engaging and always fun to play.

Its point of differentiation is that each suit provides a different type of gem-getting (ie score) benefit when you win a trick in that led suit, as well as each time you play offsuit when you can't follow. Which provides unusually significant benefits for being short-suited (which is interesting). Otherwise though there's not much "clever" one can bring to it. Good hands will score well, having lots of diamond cards (the best suit) will score well, and low to middling hands without a short suit won't, regardless of how well you count cards. It's easy to teach and pleasant to play though, which is always good.

I love Tichu so I was interested in the somewhat hyped game Diamonds. I have played it twice, but it felt unexciting and mechanical, like no one cared about what happened.

RATING: 6
I have had some fun playing this game and it is easy to get people to play since most people have played some sort of trick taking game in their past.  It is a pure trick taking game with suit actions added so it should appeal to a wide variety of gamers. It does not have quite the tension of climbing games like Haggis or Tichu, but it should be a lot of fun in a variety of settings. The diamond tokens alone add a nice tactile feel to playing the game and can easily rope in observers.

It's just whist with a couple of twists, but the pieces make it look nice and pleasing to play. It also has a bit of take that, but not too much. Pleasantly surprised with it. It is a bit expensive for what it is.

RATING: 6
Diamonds feels very much like a traditional trick-taking game.  However, instead of keeping score with a paper and pencil, players are trying to accumulate gem tokens.  During a round, players must follow suit as usual, but if they cannot, they get to perform a special ability according to the suit of the card that they do play.  These special abilities manipulate the gem tokens--you can get new tokens, steal other player's tokens, or put the tokens in your safe so they cannot be stolen.  Then, at the end of the round, whoever amasses the most of each suit card gets to take that suit's ability.  It definitely works for fans of the genre, but trick-taking doesn't really do much for me.

Although luck of the deal is always a factor, a good trick taking game will give you strategic options even with a poor hand. That doesn't seem to be the case here. Diamond-suited cards are simply the best to have, because diamonds in your vault are both safer and worth more points.
Also: The components are pretty, but don't fit the game very well. Since making change would tell other players something about the hidden diamonds in your vault (and since the diamonds out front get stolen or hidden one at a time) the higher denomination diamonds never get used.

I had high hopes for Diamonds. Maybe too high. I like trick-taking, and the special powers in the game were interesting, but I think they elevated the role of luck a little too much. First, not all cards are used, so card counting is not as reliable as it is with most trick-takers. Second, some of the suit-powers are just strictly better than others. A person dealt a handful of diamonds is going to do well regardless of what anyone else has or does in the round. I didn’t hate the game, and I think many families will enjoy it. However, I think I’d rather play Hearts.

Diamonds is a twist on Hearts and Spades and made it a gamer's game out of it. It feels like there are a few paths to victory but so far luck of the draw dictated my first game (I came in last). Losing didn't sour the game for me though, but the people I played with has analysis paralysis and dragged a 30 minute game into a 45 min game. We pulled the plug at round 4 for a 5-player game because it was going for too long. I'd like it to be a 20-30 mins game like the box suggested.

---- Update ----
Maybe this game was over hyped a bit but after 5 games under my belt I felt the game is pretty random even with perfect diamond variant (we always played this way). The desire to play this game has dropped so rating from 8 -> 7. Oh and the card design makes the cards hard to read and have to fan out the cards made the rating dropped too.

RATING: 6
OK trick-taking game. Nice idea of how each suit has a different ability, but it makes then in some cases some suits are better for you then others and is therefore increases the luck. For example: in our game all my diamonds were in my vault. I had tons of spades, but they were useless for me.

Really solid, simple trick taking game. Play that suit if you have it, highest lead of suit wins the trick and gets to perform an action based on that suits special power. The interesting element is you gain perks if you are forced to play off suit. Makes someone second guess fully winning all tricks if another person is going to be gaining the same value.

Diamonds got a lot of love in a recent trick-takers geeklist, and I love a trick-taker! But while I enjoyed this one, I felt that maybe it was aimed more at the 'gateway' end of the tricktaker market, while I've played so many that I'm always on the lookout for quirky twists. So as Clubs is to climbing games, Diamonds is to trick-takers perhaps?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is the best trick-taking game I have played, though that isn't necessarily saying much.

I like the special powers of the different suits, and I like the strategy of trying to run out of a suit so you can play off-suit cards and activate their powers. I also like the catch-up mechanic where if you don't win any suits you get some diamonds in your vault, so you can try to game the round to not win any tricks if your hand is awful.

In the end, it's still a trick-taking game though. There's not a lot of deep decision-making or strategy going on, and it can be frustrating to get dealt bad hands several times in a row.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
7.5 - Played a few times, definitely fills the niche of a simple card game with a little bit extra to it.  I've been surprised at how many people I game with don't know or don't remember how to play hearts but even then it's simple to teach.  This will likely get a lot more play the next time I visit family.

*****
6.5 - I played this again and while I appreciate the game the flow is awfully clunky.  We're constantly reminding each other that whoever took the trick to takes an action for doing so.  Players refer to the cheat sheets every time they play a card because with the exception of the club there isn't an intuitive connection to the suits.  And the diamonds, which are the entire point of the game, feel tacked on.  I enjoy a light card game but the point scoring gets in the way of the game since it's in the middle of each trick.

Can't imagine playing this with less than 4 players, but with four or more it can be fun.  A bit random for a trick-taking game, but works with 5 or 6.  The only "meaningful" decision you can make is who to steal a diamond from.
It's not as good as Spades - or many other trick-taking games.

RATING: 7
This was a fun different trick taking game.  I was not crazy about the beat on the leader mechanic where you can steal diamonds from other players.  One player gets the lead on the first hand and then everyone steals form that player.  One player constantly just stole from another player for some reason.  Also, the numbers are way too far toward the middle of the cards making you have to spread your hand way out to see the numbers.

RATING: 7
Played 21-02-2015. Rated after 1 play. Fun take on trick-taking. Basically it's a very standard trick taking game with special abilties. You have a 'showroom' or not protected stash of gems that are worth 1 VP, and a vault in which those gems are worth 2 VPs. The winner of the trick leads the next card. The twist is, if you cannot follow suit, you get to play off-suit AND get the special ability of the suit. At the end of the round when all hands are empty, you count who has the most of each suit, those players also get to take the action of the suit once more.

Each trick you have to follow suit. The winner of the trick gets a special ability of the color he led. Diamonds lets you put one gem from the supply directly into your vault, Hearts allows you to move a gem from the supply to your 'showroom'. Spades allows you to 'bank' one gem from your 'showroom' to your vault and clubs allow you to steal one from your opponents showroom and move it to your showroom.

I liked it a lot. The components are nice, the artstyle on the cards fantastic. Downside is that the box is quite big for the components and takes up more space than it should (I think), the card quality is not that high unfortunately and the MSRP is high.

I'm not getting all the love for this new trick-taking game.  Without there being anything dangerous to take, it just seems that who ever got dealt the better cards wins.  There's a little bit of decisions in passing cards to get out of suit and then what card to play when out of the played suit, but this game is very light and does not improve at all on classics like Hearts.  I guess it's a lot less stressful, might be a better choice when playing with kids.

Played thrice and enjoyed it quite a bit each time. Clever use of suit powers keep players engaged because you get actions whenever you can break suit.

This is a really clever game that I find rather frustrating. When you have decisions in this game I think it is a lot of fun, but I found myself frequently being stuck having to play the hand I was dealt. It can be wearing to win gems in front of you it gives a false impression that you are ahead and serves up gems for others to plunder from. 

It is far better to win nothing and take two gems behind the screen than it is is to win one or two tricks, losing the bonuses, especially when the only thing that you've had the chance to do is line up gems for people to steal.

I gave my copy to someone that really enjoyed it, yay!

I should also mention that the art on the cards is fantastic.

I loooooooove trick takers. Love. So of course I have been very excited about this game. I need many more plays of this to determine where it falls in the spectrum of trick takers, but so far it is very very promising. It's like Hearts or Spades with the addition of special suit "powers" that allow you to score points when you play off-suit or have the most of a suit at the end of a round. Because of the way the Diamonds flow from stockpile->showroom->vault using Suit Actions, you must carefully plan the order of your play. I recommend experienced trick takers play the "perfect information" variant.

after several more plays, rating on this is up in the air.  i'm not sure if it's fun or broken.  that's an issue with trick takers: repeated plays are necessary, and it is often hard to get a group to play a game consistently.

1 play, prototype

Mary taught the rest of us (me, Cedric, Martin).

This is a pretty basic trick taking game (cards 1-15 in 4 suits, deal 10/player, must follow suit if possible) with a twist: each suit has a power. The winner of the trick acts on the power, which moves plastic gem "diamonds" in various ways, with the main goal being to get as many of these as you can behind your screen. People who don't follow suit also get the special power of the suit they did play. After 10 tricks, players count all their cards per suit: player with most gets the special power. After n hands, gems score points (more for those behind screen, I think?).

It was enjoyable enough, but the prototype artwork was a bit difficult to read. Will try it again in final form, although I prefer climbing games like Tichu and Chimera over these.

Once upon a time, long before I got into designer games, I was a huge fan of trick-taking card games.  Specifically Spades, which I played every day at school.  I still enjoy trick-taking games today, they are quick, fun, social experiences but I am also much more into deeper designer game experiences.  So a hybrid game like this is a nice addition to my collection.

Granted, deep hardly describes this game.  It is really just a trick-taking game played with a deck of 60 cards instead of 52 (same 4 suits but numbered 1-15).  The small addition to this formula is that each suit relates to an action with these diamonds that are each player's points.

The diamond suit allows you to take a diamond from the supply and put it in your vault (diamonds in your vault are worth 2 points and are "locked").  Hearts let you take a diamond and put it in front of your vault (only worth 1 point at game end and can be stolen).  Spades let you put a diamond from in front of your vault in your vault.  And clubs let you take a diamond from in front of another player's vault and put it in front of yours.

You get to take these actions whenever you win a trick led with that suit.  You also get these actions immediately when you play off-suit and at the end of a round each player who has the majority of each suit from won tricks gets that action.  Any player who took no tricks at all gets 2 diamond actions.

This makeup makes the best strategy to play off suit as much as possible during the game and collect no tricks for the two diamond actions.  This isn't the easiest to do as anyone who has attempted to go nil in Spades can tell you.  In the end there isn't a whole lot here to make this more than another trick-taking game played with a standard deck of cards.  But what is here makes it just a little more intriguing and it is something you could play with pretty much anybody.  I still need to try the partner variant, I like trick-taking with a partner so this might be my cup of tea.

[Stronghold Games 2014 edition] {Diamonds; trick-taking; optimal 4p} Diamonds adds a twist to traditional trick taking game.  When you cannot follow a suit, you can get a suit action.  So, it’s not that bad when you cannot win a trick.

It is also a nice challenging hand management game that you need to find ways to secure your crystals into the vault to get better score.

I think 4p is better.  The game will not last too long.  But the down side is 20 cards would not be used in a round, which increases some luck.

The production quality is good, but the card illustration is boring.

- need to follow the lead suit.

Saw on the GenCon BGGTV stream and had to have it.
My Ex and I used to play a lot of Spades and Hearts, plus other sundry trick taking games so I knew I'd like it, and with it being almost a standard deck of cards I felt I could teach it quickly.
The fact that you seldom "throw away" a card helps keep all players engaged.

Nice enough trick-taker, where points are determined by jewels in front of & behind your screen. Trick winner takes a suit-specific action to gain / steal / store a jewel, as does anyone who plays out of suit (no trumps per se).

Rather over-produced, over-sized & over-priced.

Nice twist on a trick taking game which really makes you think of what suit you want to invest in at the start of each round to try and have a winning strategy though ultimately, it is a simple trick taking game. However, even losing tricks still means you can do something and whilst the 'take 2 diamonds if you don't win any tricks in a round' appears overpowered, doesn't appear to make any difference and the winner tends to be the win that plays the smartest. Nice quick game and have played 2 and 4 player.

Basic trick taking game with some minor twists that make it better than normal. Nothing super amazing (like Tichu) but definitely a good entry level path to trick taking games that doesn't stray too far from the norm.

EDIT: After playing it again I feel like it doesn't hold up as much as I want. It is comparable to Hearts and Spades, but not as fun as other games. I think Indulgence might be a bit better.

Diamonds is a well done trick taking card game. Players are trying to collect diamonds by winning tricks or throwing off. Each suit has a different special ability associated with it, with diamonds being the best. If you like trick taking games like Spades or Euchre then you will most definitely enjoy this game as it is perhaps the best of its kind.

Rating as a 2P "perfect" game only.
The game is completely draw dependent and offers no decisions that are non-obvious. I would expect better results with more players, but at it's heart I'm not sure what the game offers that is unique enough for this to make a dent in the market. I also can't figure out the point of hiding your vault diamonds. 

It also has the same problem as every other standard deck card game, and that is that everyone already has the components making it a hard sell.

When the complete distribution of cards is known, this is actually a really good game, and I'd give it a 7.5 rating, but at many player counts, some cards are not dealt, and the game suffers as a result; incomplete information is OK for a trick-taking game only if you're able to deduce the unknown through solid play.

tl;dr: it's a trick taking game!

Yes, trick taking games are a dime a dozen and as you should know I'll compare each and every one of them with [thing=354][/thing]. Because :) And guess what? I still haven't found any that comes close. But this one is pretty solid. The twist (every one has one, no?) in this one is that each suit has a kicker action which you get to use when you win a trick... and when you can't follow! And that's pretty huge. Keep the right cards so you can play them when you can't follow. Because in this game that is a good thing.
What did bother me is that it is pretty hard to take the lead away from someone once they they get going.
All in all a solid game, but it's no Sticheln :)

Pretty fun.  The Diamonds are by far the best trick to win as they are auto points.  Being able to use the abilities of cards you sluff off seemed too good.  I recognize that this probably the part of the game that will become clearer to me with more plays.

This game is very good at training your memory and logic. You have to learn when to win and when to lose in order to play your cards well and get the win at the end. I think it would make a great gateway game for kids, as it is educative and fun at the same time!

Need something that brings a bit of a twist to the Hearts and Spades? Diamonds is here to bring that sweet freshness. Players are collecting diamonds based on winning card tricks (a la hearts) or playing off suit if they cannot follow. I would take this game to play with people who are used to playing the classic card games to breath some new life into those gaming circles. I wouldn't recommend this game to most seasoned gamers, but it's an excellent gateway game for those who have only played spades / hearts / bridge / rook / dominos / monopoly.

Exceedingly pleasant trick-taking game that makes losing a trick just as important as winning. However, I'm not a fan of the gem-stealing ability as it adds an unnecessary king-making opportunity that feels out of place. Also, I'd like to try the perfect information version so that players can better anticipate which cards have yet to be played. In other words, I like the basic innovation. I just wish the surrounding game was more geared towards serious players. But of course that's a matter of where you are as a card player and what you're looking for in terms of weight.

I'm not a big fan of trick taking games that are played with a non-standard deck of cards.  Bridge, Hearts, Spades, Euchre, and Pinocle have survived years of play and I've yet to find a designer trick taking game that's as good as those.  Diamonds is no exception.

The suit abilities are kind of interesting, although I'm not a big fan of the stealing.  The strategy in the game is otherwise very weird.  You want to take tricks, but you also don't want to take tricks?  Maybe strategy would become more apparent after more plays, but it seems very random.  I would never play this if I had the option to play Spades or Bridge.

I love trick-taking games and enjoy playing clever new ones with novel twists. Diamonds has that twist - the fact that even sloughing when you can't follow suit gives you a special action. The problem here is that the actions given by hearts and clubs are almost irrelevant, and the spades action weak compared with the instant point-banking ability given by diamonds. Being dealt the most diamonds will almost always give you the victory. Sad ... this could have been much better ...

Way overpriced for a standard deck of cards and some cheap plastic gems, but luckily this can be played with any standard deck of cards, a Sticheln deck, or most similarly, a Clubs deck. Just add some homemade player screens (made from cardstock or taken from a board game that uses screens) and some generic counters and print the rules. Planning to try it out soon.

I used these plastic diamonds http://www.amazon.com/Diamond-Confetti-Wedding-Bridal-Decorations/dp/B002MNWESY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1409227399&sr=8-1&keywords=plastic+diamonds and a Clubs deck and it works great.

Update: Unfortunately, the game just isn't very good. Some of the suit powers are really useful and some are almost useless, which means that you can have no chance if you get a bad hand of cards.

One of the best card trick taking games. Brilliant mechanics and components!

RATING: 5.5
First I will say one thing: I really like traditional card games. I played a lot of [thing=6887][/thing] back in college (seriously, a lot, in the level of thousand plays) and also a good deal (hundreds) of [thing=19969][/thing], a trick-taking that combines also lots of bluff, yelling and trash-talk. Finally, I played, for years, games of [thing=17104][/thing] with my family. I know this type of games, and know them well.

[thing=152162][/thing] presents itself in the tagline: "If you like Hearts and Spades, you will love... Diamonds". How could I resist?

Well, I did, for quite a while. Firt, because I couldn't find it anywhere, and, then, when I realised that the price was really steep for a "tradicional" card game. But I have bitten the bullet and purchased it.

[b]How is it played?[/b]

[thing=152162][/thing] works a lot like Hearts, only thing is that each suit has an action associated with it, activated only for the person that won the trick and for those that didn't followed the suit of the trick. The purpose of the game is to score the highest amount of points by collecting diamonds - in the vault (behind the player's screen) the diamond is worth 2 points, and in the showroom (in front the screen) it is worth 1 point.

The suit actions are:

- Diamonds: take 1 diamond from the bank and put it in your vault;
- Hearts: take 1 diamond from the bank and put it in your showroom;
- Spades: take 1 diamond from your showroom and put it in your vault;
- Clubs: take 1 diamond from someone else's showroom and put it in your showroom.

Players, as usual, have to follow the suit opened in the trick. Everytime someone can't follow suit, she can played whatever suit she wants, and apply the effect immediately. The winner of the trick keeps it, with a card of the suit on top, for end of the round purposes.

Everyone starts with 3 diamonds in the showroom.

After the distribution of the cards (10 for each player), the dealer will decide how many cards will be passed left (always left) - 1, 2 or 3. Then, the person to the left of the dealer will start the first trick.

The play lasts for an amount of round equal to the number of players, and each round is comprised of 10 tricks. At the end of each round, players see the ones that acquired more tricks for each of the four suits - the player with the most Diamonds tricks will do a Diamond action, the player with the most Hearts tricks will do a Hearts action, and so on. In case of a tie, the action isn't done. The players that didn't won a trick do two Diamonds actions.

At the end of all the rounds, the player with the most points will be the winner.

[b]What I liked?[/b]

As I said, I like traditional card games as most of them are really easy to teach and to play, and with enough variation, simply due to how shuffling works, to keep themselves interesting even after hundreds of plays. [thing=152162][/thing] doesn't stray from this - the "complication" of each suit having a different action isn't not even close to a major one - they should be pretty easy to remember, and each player has a player aid to help in this. However, I will mention that, when playing with experient players, veterans of hundreds of board games, even as far as in the final rounds there were still people making mistakes and forgetting how things work. Is amazing how the brain works: it seems that if the players expect the game to be easy to understand, they will get the rules by osmosis, putting the same effort made to keep breathing.

Anyway, the components are pretty great (and explain the price tag): the diamonds are beautiful enough to became the object of attention of passing persons. The cards are well done and differentiated enough (each suit have, along with the symbol, different internal art and colors), so mistakes in playing the wrong suit wasn't an issue. The box isn't big, beign, nonetheless, large enough to hold the sleeved cards.

And the coolest thing is the idea to make not participating in the suit the most exciting time. In [thing=6887][/thing], after the Queen has been tossed, not following the suit has, most of the time, little consequence, and you might play absentmindedly. Not in [thing=152162][/thing], as this is the moment the game shines the most. So, basically, every hand matters.

[b]What I didn't liked?[/b]

There isn't many players that like games that allow the "bash the leader", as everyone puts themselves in the position of the leader, beign attacked. Now, there isn't a good way to deal with this in several board and card games - is basically required, in [thing=93][/thing], to give problems for the person ahead; you just have to attack the gang with the most people alive in [thing=170][/thing]; inflate the price of an auction, for the richest to reach deeper in her pockets, in [thing=46][/thing]; or simply bury a science card in [thing=68448][/thing].

Games with interaction will have this more or less present. The ones with less interaction will usually have some "break" for the leader, in order to make the game harder for those ahead (the catch-up). If neither of this is present, a third danger arises: the runaway leader, with little to no chance to be catched. Is a fine balance in all of this, and very complicated to be reached in designs.

All this preamble is to contextualize this: in [thing=152162][/thing], as said earlier, the Clubs action allows for players to steal others, and, mainly, this serves to attack the leader. This isn't a problem on itself, as beign a game with the luck of the draw, someone sure can receive better cards and activate more actions and get more diamonds. The Clubs works to stop a runaway leader. The deal is: this isn't really the way it works - you get a lot of the dreadful "attack the apparent leader".

As in [thing=152162][/thing] there are open points (showroom) and hidden points (vault), it requires a nice amount of attention of the players to actually try to know which player is leading. However, the danger of this is the much more usual "I think he is ahead" - you could be right, you could be wrong. And this is precisely why most persons in my group dislike [thing=40692][/thing] - in round 1 and 2 someone acquire lots of points. "He is the leader", and a finger is pointed. It is now round 8 and there are still people thinking that the same one is leading, "because remember that 14 points? A lot, dude! I'm most definitely haven't beign able to catch-up to that! Attack him, now!... Ah, nice. Hey, I won! Who would thought of that?!", smirkes away into the sunset.

[thing=152162][/thing] even acts against itself on this, as it gives the players the false idea of wealth, with the diamonds in the showroom. Picture the following situation, just after you activated a Clubs action:

- You: 4 diamonds in the showroom
- P2: 3 diamonds in the showroom
- P3: 9 diamonds in the showroom
- P4: 1 diamonds in the showroom
- P5: 6 diamonds in the showroom

Sure, in a proper game you would have more to work on, but considering only the above, chances are that you would steal from P3 or P5, right? This is also the logic that I saw at the table several times - I will steal of the player with the most. But, when considering all the actions present in the game, the logic should be more the inverse: the less diamonds someone have in the showroom, more the player will have in the vault. However, then we have the Spades action. Someone could be activating them a lot, having few diamonds in the showroom, and still be almost 50% behind the one activating Diamonds.

Therefore, I know this isn't a rule (as depends more on activations made so far), but is a fair approximation, as the distribution of the cards won't be balanced in just a few rounds (would require something in line of near infinite hands of cards), however, it is fair to consider activations around the same, just in different suits. So, if I activated lots of Diamonds and Spades, less is the chance I will have more diamonds in the showroom.

Now, is important to add that isn't only the amount of a type of suit you receive that matters, but the amount you can activate. With a hand with 3 / 3 / 2 / 2, chances are you won't activate many of these (unless high numbers are in place). Anyway, is is very possible that is worst to have 3 medium-low Diamonds (even this beign the best suit) than 3 of other suits (even considering the same range of numbers on the cards).

Well, the "attack the apparent leader" was a big issue for me, even though I understand that it won't matter as much with more watchful players and less prone to be distracted by shiny objects (but the latter is the ones I get when playing card games).

Now, another nuisance: only in 6 players all the cards will be present in play. With less player, counting cards is useless when 10, 20, 30 cards don't even show up. Maybe this was exactly the purpose of the designer, to make [thing=152162][/thing] more appealing for those that can't or don't want to count cards, and those that don't like the memory aspect in games. It makes also more friendly for casual play. I get that. Still, for me, in a game with randomly given cards, the only sort of control possible is count cards - don't even need to be hardcore about it, just that "I guess all Spades were played". Luckly the solution is pretty easy: give 12 cards when playing with 5, and 15 when playing with 4. It will increase the duration of the play, but...

A play already takes way more time than I thought it would. It says in the box 20-30 minutes. Yeah, right. Everytime I played with 5, the game lasted for around 50 minutes. I will give the treatment of 10 minutes per players if asked how much time the [thing=152162][/thing] lasts, when considering play + shuffle. And rounds in [thing=152162][/thing] takes more time than those in [thing=6887][/thing], when considering all the activations. Don't be misled: you won't play a full game, with 4+ players in 30 minutes, unless you rush everyone, and this will lots of fun, eh?

[b]Final thoughts:[/b]

Tough. [thing=152162][/thing] goes into that vein of games I enjoy a lot, but my plays so far were lackluster. But my second was better than my first, and the third better than the second. I took more than my fair share of time to actually "get" [thing=6887][/thing] and play it properly. One do can get better at [thing=6887][/thing], even with the randomness present in its, well, heart. Therefore, I didn't wrote off [thing=152162][/thing] just yet. I just wish I could see a way to keep Clubs as a differentiated action (like, the player with the most diamonds in the Vault, takes one from it and put it in the showroom - yes, this would take away the hidden aspect, but [thing=6887][/thing] works well with the open score, and, still, the player would keep the diamond, to give more work for the Spades. All of this is just mumbles, pay no heed) more able to actually hit the leader, not the third struggling player. Still, I will keep the rules as they are for now.

Who knows, maybe someday [thing=152162][/thing] will reach the thousand plays of [thing=6887][/thing], as it sure have the same rough start for me, and [thing=6887][/thing] turned alright.

Amazing additions to a standard trick taking games to step up the game, but prone to AP!

This is a great trick taking game.  If you like Hearts and Spades, I think you'll really like this one as well.  I took this over to my friend's house and she and her husband really liked it.  They play games with me to be nice, but it's not really their thing.  This is a game they asked to play again.

RATING: 6.5
Enjoyable little trick-taking game.  Randomness can give a pretty big advantage here and there (e.g. high diamond hands are excellent, or you can have strong spades when you can't use the spade effect), but there's room for some interesting choices to be made.

9/12/2014: This game is a big hit, but I thought it was ok. Best strategy is to do your best to avoid taking tricks, run out of certain suits, then play cards out of suit to automatically get the rewards.

Trickier than it looks! There's a neat interplay of tactics involved, and it doesn't suffer for not having a trump suit. It may not take a top spot for me when it comes to trick-taking games, but I can see myself playing it again.

Simple trick taking game. Diamonds are the best cards, as they allow to get the points directly to the vault.

I have a thing about playing contemporary games that are versions of traditional card games - the thing is, many of them work really well, and this is one of them... perhaps one that will strike a cord with fans of those traditional games, then.

Trick taking card game. Follow suit. Meat of the game is suit and off suit actions to manipulate and acquire crystal tokens to secretly store behind your vault. Beautiful art decco printed cards of a 60 card deck of the basic suits valued 1-15. Unlike typical trick takers, this game gives you strategic options even with a traditionally weak drawn hand.

As anyone who knows me knows, if I win a game the first time I play it, I will probably have good things to say about it.  Probably (Five Tribes is an exception; won that game every time I played it, yet still don't like it).  Anyhow, this game I played once and won.  I would like to think it was due my amazing strategy, or maybe it was just luck, but yeah, this game is pretty good so I'd play it if it was suggested.

A solid weight family card game. Every one i have taught this game to has enjoyed it. There may be a smudge of strategy but a fair amount of luck in what you're dealt. 
Still it's easy to teach and a great gateway card game

I thought the [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/image/2724721/diamonds]vaults[/url] were submarine hatches, so the first trick ended in depth charges and an "admiral's salute".  Awkward!

Trick taking game. But it does it great, this is already been played many times before or after a main game.

Almost everyone gets to do someting good. And even if you didn't get any tricks you still get gems to put in your vault.

We play with a fixed deck and 6 rounds with 3 players.

Very simple gamed up trick taking game. 

Very easy to teach, and just as easy to forget. A great choice if you're playing with non-gamers or just want to table talk and not worry to much about the game. 

Games with higher player counts run a bit long, but they're my favorite as it's just so relaxing and fun.

This is a game that I could have picked up at GenCon 2014 when I was picking up my copy of Panamax but wasn't even on my radar until my wife and I were invited over to a neighbors house who was having a euchre tournament. I had played my fair share of euchre growing up but had overlooked "card games" since getting in to the hobby as they didn't seem as interesting. Well... how wrong was I? I forgot how much fun trick-taking games could be.

The simple addition of being able to gain a benefit from not following suit or not winning any tricks, adds so much to the game as you're constantly engaged. Being able to perform additional actions at the end of a round based on the the number of cards that you have in a particular suit is great, and who wouldn't enjoy playing around with a giant pile of plastic "diamonds".

This is a very versatile trick taking game that is fun for both seasoned and casual gamers and something that I should play more.

Typical trick taking game. I'm not as sold on it as the recent hype. Even with the "special" off suit abilities there seems to be very little decision making and it always feels like there is an obvious choice to make. Then it comes down to what cards you are dealt.

A standard trick-taker that has a fun twist. It works for 2P, which is how I mainly play, but is better with more. I enjoy trick takers but, unless they're really special or unique, I don't feel like I need to own them. So it's a case of: it's not you, it's me.

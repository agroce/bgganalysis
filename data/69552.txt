Unfortunately, this game has a lot of design and rule weaknesses. Roomcards made from cardboard and only one character by one player would be better. I could say more... but a better note, it is not. So, a great game mechanics and idea goes under.

We have torched the hive several time, but each game has been fun whether it happens or not. Winning a game can become impossible for any player at any point, so if that bothers you, this game is not for you.

Update: Now usually too easy for uninfected with 4 players.

151117 The fiddliness of the game is a problem.

130929 Now that I've played some great games at resistance, I have to say its a bit fiddly for what it is.  Not a bad game (though I have issues with the rulebook) but resistance gets straight to the point.  And I like elegance in my games.

120909 Tense mean paranoia game.  It IS fragile, but not in a way that you can't work around it.   You need to frame the game experience right and if you have the right card it is a very tight game.
I also completely rewrote the rules so put me in the camp that the rulebook sucks balls.  But still, this is definitely worth playing if that's what you're looking for.

The whole group is waiting to play this again. Accusations were flying around the table. The game felt tense, and no one was sure who to trust. I hadn't a clue who the infected was until I heat scanned my buddy, which I did because I wanted to see if he had a specific item, and there I see the infected card. 

This game has so many issues, but it shines in my group. We play it about once a year, and it's a blast.

RATING: 6
This game CAN be a ton of fun. However, there are some significant drawbacks in the rulebook. I mean, a human can't shoot a gun? WTF? Why do I start the game with a weapon that has no ammo? Androids can't win? Why do I have to trade everytime I go into a room? The game mechanics and the game theme do not match up at all. Why does a gas can cancel out an infection attempt? Makes no thematic sense. To get the full enjoyment of this one, prepare to modify the game with a few house rules.

The best games transcend their components to be a unique experience for the players to share.  Panic Station is one such game, and I used to rate it highly because it managed to be so memorable with so few components.   The production isn't perfect, but to quibble over those would be to diminish this fantastic game.

The problem, though, is that while playing the game can be fun, the game itself isn't fun.  Sounds like a paradox....but that is what this game is.   Everything about it should be fun, and yet, the rules are such a mess, I'm not sure whether anyone has ever played the game as the designer intended.

Some more plays have convinced me that this is worthwhile. I advise people to read Dumon's thread on How to teach Panic Station, as the game has a great potential for being misunderstood (the poor thing).

The premise seems really cool and the artwork is slick. At first glance, it seems like a nifty card based dungeon crawler with a traitor mechanic.

Rules in the box were not good, but fixed up with a download off the net v2.1 I think from their web-site. The game improved a lot when we started playing in the spirit of "It's better to win with as few people on your team as possible!". Still a little annoyed infected players get eaten by bugs, and players have no defense from 'exchanging-fluids' on their turn. Might write up an optional rule or two for these. Having fun with it at the moment!

It's a mess of a game that feels unfinished, but I enjoyed playing it with my gaming group. There are some interesting ideas, but overall it seems to have a lot of tacked on arbitrary rules that don't even make sense thematically. Still, the traitor mechanic makes for some fun light role-playing, but ultimately this is a novelty item.

RATING: 5
At heart, Panic Station is a dungeon crawler, somewhat reminiscent of Doom in its theme and of Claustrophobia in its simplicity, single objective (burn the parasites' hive) and unvariegated monsters.  What adds interest is the concept of infection and the paranoia that induces quite effectively.  

I've played the game twice using the version 1 rules and both plays have felt unsatisfactory in different ways.  In our first game with six players, the crowded rooms and our inexperience led to a rapid victory for the parasites.  Our second attempt with four felt very gamey as we swapped gas cards like crazy until we realised that nobody was infected, and exploited the bizarre explore rules to locate and torch the hive in double-quick time.  

So, my early impressions are that Panic Station is a fragile beast.  Played in the right spirit and with some help from the cards coming out in the right sequence, it could be fun.  Otherwise, it just won't be for one reason or another.

Panic Station is packaged in a sturdy tin and the components inside are acceptable.  The artwork is satisfyingly grungy, though the parasites could have been scarier.  The rules left us asking questions.

RATING: 5.5
I like the premise, but my first two games were both anti-climaxes, with no infections achieved and easy (but drawn out and tedious) wins for the humans. I'm not sure the mix of a thematic game with some very gamey and non-intuitive rules really works.

However my third game (played under protest) was a bit more enjoyable, because at the last minute there was a sudden turn-around and win for the host. An enjoyable play-- but I still think the game has flaws and that enjoyment hinges on a very skilful or lucky host.

(NB The rules supplied are very unclear, but the updated 2.1 rules available online are much clearer, definitely use these in future).

So this game should be subtitled "Trading Gas Cans" because that is what it results in if you play with the out of the box rules. 

I was contacted by a designer (David Ausloos)of the game and said that the rules have been updated online and in future editions.  Sorry, but I rate the game based on what the rules say (barring errata), not on variants of the game after the fact.

Rules are extremely convoluted in an attempt to make the mechanics work, but the game does not flow at all. It could at least be considered "atmospheric", but even thematically the game doesn't make much sense. What is it with the virus, the parasites, the hive? The traitor mechanics (virus contagion) is totally unrelated to the physical threat of parasites, and neither is directly connected to the win condition (destroying the hive). I could go on but you get the point.

The game that stands awkwardly between Battlestar Gallactica and Resistance. The theme often makes no sense (eg. You give gasoline to avoid being infected...), and that leaves us a completely uninteresting game.

Not my sort of game, co-op with hidden traitor. I started as the traitor and mainly killed time hoping to find a time to infect without it being obvious.
Ended up with a non-player giving things away and ruining the result, although it seemed I'd managed to infect without others picking up on it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Didn't care for this game...someone at the table summed it up perfectly: 
"This feels like 80 or 90% of a complete game".

The never changing turn order seemed bizarre especially since unlocked doors via computer only lasted for the rest of that turn (rather than AT LEAST until it got back to that person). Sure that fact can be strategic, but it really felt unnecessary to make player order so important for things like who went to the computer.

Also it seemed like a "run away" strat for everyone uninfected seemed very plausible...anyone that went toward you just looks really suspicious.

Once you get a knife it seemed easy to enter a room and not trade.

Finally the game is too short, you really want to (as the infected) get people to trust you so they don't give you a gas can so you can infect them successfully...but that means multiple trades (which makes you suspicious if you want that) and the game simply isn't long enough to facilitate that. In the second game we played the person to get infected only had 2 turns before we were able to burn the hive...because it was the last of the first 9 cards.

Trading needs to be more "required" to win.

It's possible we were playing it wrong, but I didn't like what seemed to be there enough to find out, nor do I think it'd really matter.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Having survived as the last human left alive, and then shot, that meant that I was the only loser in the game.  That feels a little unfair!  Also, being first player, meant that I could never benefit from getting the doors unlocked.  (And yes, it was behind a locked door....)

Edit: the designer has indicated that revised V2.2 rules clarify a lot of things, and modify turn order, which would have been a big help!  And I should point out that "co-operative" games (which I think this kinda qualifies as) are not my favourite genre.  In fact, I don't like any of them!

Sikerült még 2011-ben kipróbálni az egyik legnagyobb visszhangot kapott ezévi Esseni játékot. Ráadásul az asztalnál a játékosok fele nagyon rutinos volt, 20+ játékkal. A játékot megelőzően elég szélsőséges véleményekkel találkoztam, kíváncsian vártam, milyen élmény lesz.

Nos, érdekes a játék, kb. ez a 4. általam ismert ilyen típusú játék, amiben titkos személyiségek küzdenek ellentétes célokért. 2 parti alapján nem rossz, de nem is érzem átütőnek. Azt mondják a rutinosak, hogy az igazi feszültségét nem sikerült megtapasztalnom, mert elég lapos partik voltak, értsd: túl egyértelmű volt végig a szereposztás. Ennek ellenére látom benne a fantáziát.

A játék előnyei: nagy az újrajátszhatóság, vannak benne ötletes dolgok (scannalés pl., meg maga a tárgycsere).
Hátrányai: Túl egyértelműnek tűnik mindkét féllel, hogy mit kell csinálni. Másrészt elég ha egy valaki bénázik, és azzal elronthatja az egész játékélményt. Meglepően hosszú volt ahhoz képest, hogy viszonylag egyszerű maga a szabály. Másfél óra volt egy parti.

A kiegyensúlyozottságot és a szerencsét nem kérem számon, mivel ez egy partijáték, de akár 5 perc alatt is vége lehet:)

A Resistance-szel azonos pontot adok rá, de mindkettővel játszani kellene még. Teljesen más súlycsoport egyébként, ez sokkal bonyolultabb.

Initial Impression: This game has an interesting theme and a great traitor mechanism. I enjoyed my plays of it. However, I can see that the game has some serious drawbacks if not played with the right group of players. It can feel "gamey" at times if winning is all that matters to the players. I feel this game should be played for the experience rather than "to win".

After five plays and a couple of demos, this game does exactly what I was hoping it would do. It creates a tense atmosphere where each trade with another player not only causes you to rethink your strategy but has every other player around the table studying your face to see whether you are now one of the infected.  I've had nothing but fun playing this game and look forward to many future plays!

First Play: Played with inexperienced gamers who didn't really understand the card passing process and got it horribly wrong. As a result the game was a complete farse that took 1 hour 45 minutes including rule explaining and ended up with three players confessing they had played incorrectly from the outset.

OK this is an extreme and poor intro to the game but it is incredibly fragile if someone makes a mistake. The rule book isn't particularly clear and the enjoyment factor comes 90% from the attituude of the players. 

Can't say I'd rush to play this one again and one that would never join my collection.

I have finally played a game of this, and I must say that I really enjoyed it. Playing up the paranoia added great tension for all of us. By end game, I had trusted the wrong person and thought that the Host was the only innocent player left! I had been infected, too, and we did win through infection. It was a great experience, and I hope to play again! However, a player that is picky about thematic mechanics can tear the game apart if you let them. Hint: don't.

Yet another unoriginal addition to the betrayal/witch-hunt trend that broke out in the last years: I’m not a fan of the genre but at least other games (such as The Resistance) keep the things simple and swift.

Panic Station instead burdens the players with an uselessy heavy and complex rules system, some of which are too unrealistic to let the players immerse in the game and they only make the game duller: just to mention a couple, there’s no real reason why a character can’t be infected should he swap his gas tank when receiving an infection card; nor there is it to explain why an android can be infected and, when it happens, why it immediately trasmits the parasite to its owner even though he’s in the other corner of the always-too-cramped station.

I trusted this game could change my dislike for the genre: sadly though it has only strengthened it.

RATING: 5
After two plays I can't say I'm impressed. The first game concluded without the host infecting anyone, while in the second it proved impossible to escape infection. I don't mind the weird abstractions (like the fact that clearly the android and human pieces are connected by a long transfusion pipe that means they share blood), but the suspicion phase doesn't last long enough for my liking.

Given the designer's comments, it seems like roleplayers are the target crowd - people used to not playing to win, and capable of adopting a role/motivation. For that reason would give it another go but am still unconvinced that the rules 'work'.

Would need to be talked into another game.

Definitely group dependant. Excellent with the right crowd. Requires some suspension of disbelief. Definitely doesn't warrant the level of criticism that it has received. I would say that you only win if you destroy the HIVE or if you are the original host and infect everyone.

The second traitor game (after battlestar galactica) I ever played. I'm really starting to become a fan of the genre ;) Plz do not try to play this with ppl who do not like traitor games or do not want to engage in some tabletalk, they will most likely ruin the gaming experience for everyone on the table.

The Englisch and Dutch rulebook contradict each-other at some fronts and a few rules are not that clearly explained in the rulebook. When you get the hang of it, this is a great game which can be played in a pretty short time.

RATING: 4
I found this game a mess. There are many rules ambiguities, and many complicated interactions. The rules make no sense thematically, (why does a gas can prevent infection?) which for a game that can only be enjoyed on that level is a pretty big problem. BY FAR, the best strategy to win is to allow yourself to become infected and attack the others. I'm pretty sure reasonable winning play would have everyone but one person infected in the first couple of turns and game over.

Only played it twice so far and didn't really understand it the first time. I liked it but will have to play it a bit more to know for sure what I like and what I don't like about it. It's probably good to know each other as there is a bit of meta-game in this one, but all in all I think it's a good game.

Nice artwork and theme. I don't really like the 'trooper linked to android' concept. It doesn't really make sense. I was hoping for gameplay more akin to the film, 'The Thing'. The rules as published led to lots of questions and have since been revised and generally improved upon so maybe it's better than I remember.

RATING: 5
Rated 6 after one play with six players. One play, and it's hard to tell what I'd think of this game over time. On the one hand, I really love the idea of "The Thing" in a board game. It's a great theme, and the play length is reasonable. 

I do have some concerns. It's possible for players to get confused. And if they do, there's nothing in the game to actually document which side he/she is on; everyone is accountable for mentally tracking their role. I wish there were tiles instead of cards for rooms. And, some rules just seem unintuitive--a monster moving [i]out of[/i] a room full of people? Only androids can shoot bullets? I can explore a room through a secured door, but I can't enter it? I get why some of those rules are in place from a gameplay perspective, but thematically, it is wonky.

In our game, the humans started out fine until multiple players quickly got infected. I have no idea how the humans are supposed to win. It's only one play, but my suspicion is that this game has a great core of an idea, but some flaws that might be hard to overcome.

Ridiculously fun quick hidden traitor game that takes less than an hour to play. You have to be willing to play in the spirit of the game. "Gaming" the system is a recipe for a bad night.

Increased to 8.5. This game is fantastic with 5 or 6. Less than that and its a little silly and too easy to figure out. It's not so much a game as an experience. I'm good with that.

Wish I could like this one more than I do.  It's a bear to teach and the rules are bizarre and counterintuitive.  I have never really felt paranoia while playing it, in any case, because the ruleset gets in the way of the theme.

Played one game and it dragged.
Fault of the players and not the game.
Need to start fast and go hard, it's too short a game to worry about making a mistake or making the optimal play.

Second game much better and way more fun.
Update. Better and better, a solid 7 in fact!

RATING: 5
Panic Station is The Resistance with more theme and less smooth mechanics, which makes it less abstract and more RPG. Some will enjoy this more, and some will enjoy it less.

Some of the mechanics are a bit clunky, but may work if you're more interested in the feeling that anyone could infect you soon.

In addition, the rules have been improved in version 2 of the rules, which makes learning and teaching the game easier.

Many of the mechanics didn't really make sense thematically, and it felt very bland overall. How is one supposed to feel the suspense if they know what the room will contain before they enter it, for instance? It also appeared to be quite imbalanced, particularly in favour of the parasites. I'll be passing on it.

Disappointing after one game.  I've been trying to find a good "werewolf" game that clicks well with my group, and this one didn't do it for me (along with The Thing, Lupusburg, Are you the Traitor?)  It ended with everyone being infected, which was kind of anti-climactic.  (We all won, yet we all kind of lost, really...)

Uh...I stuck the stickers on this. I attempted to play with some friends to no avail - we couldn't even really start the game. I felt it was a bit convoluted, themeatically messy and less accesible compared to other co-op games I know.

RATING: 4
Played this in Essen 2011 (twice, we couldn't believe it was that bad after the first round and all the hype here).

At least for us, the mechanics simply didn't work out, in both games all players were infected after after a few rounds. 

I had expected much more, but alas, even ignoring the ridiculous logic behind some of the game mechanics (concerning guns, ammo, etc.), it was just another (albeit pretty primitive) cooperation type "dungeon crawl" type of game with a "traitor" aspect.

If you want the traitor aspect which works, check out Battlestar Galactica. If you want a cooperative type dungeon crawl that works... well, there are dozens out there. Almost all of them better.

P.S.: I have changed my vote from 2 to 4, as I have been contacted by the author with some helpful tips on how to play the game (maybe should have been included with the rules?), which I am sure would increase the change that this could be playable and/or fun (though it really really didn't work for us).

Unfortunately, I don't believe I'd get my friends to give it another try.

First play only - it was a blast: paranoia everywhere and nail-biting closeness to the end!

But if your group likes to be gamey instead of playey, then the game falls apart, you will not like to resist the infection, because as the infected the game is too easy to win! (forthcoming rules are likely to change that - just to keep you informed)

RATING: 5
Components: There are several things I'd change here. First, the room cards need to be sturdy tiles. With so much commotion on the table, and pawns moving all the time, the cards are constantly rotating. Second, the action cards need to have explanations on them (with an equal amount of text on each), because otherwise players are trying to get questions answered about their cards, but without revealing information about their hand. Third, the heat scan cards could be tokens or something in a distinct shape, and the character cards could be tiles or player boards with health markers. I think that in an attempt to have all components be playing cards it adds a lot of visual clutter to the play area, because there are cards all over the place that all basically look the same.

Experience: Um, hmm. One play so far. It definitely made sense for the experienced players to give us guidance. I was able to out the host by tricking her into thinking I didn't have a gas can to exchange, and that was basically that. Want to play again, to see if it's more tense.

Paranoïa is present, it can manifest on different levels depending on the play of the host. Does he/she manifest him/herself subtle or goes for the agressive infestation. Balance is fine and cards like the antidote sure can deliver a twist. I personally like the grenade, sure delivers a punch.

You can tweak the difficulty further by manipulating the amount of gaz can cards.

A group of space marines board a space station in distress.  Unbeknownst to the others, one of the marines was quickly infected by an alien parasite, becoming the Host and trying to spread the infection to his teammates.  Every teammate the Host manages to secretly infect joins him in trying to destroy the humans, leaving the humans with no idea whom to trust.  Only by collecting sufficient fuel for one of their flamethrowers and burning down the Hive can the humans survive, but it might turn out that the player helpfully gathering your gas cans has been infected all along...

First game was 4 players.  There is a lot going on in this game ... and really has "something"... I can't quite put my finger on it.

2nd Play: Played it a second time with 4 players.
I spent considerable hours putting together a player aid, including a flow-chart for Move & Search actions which helped immensely.

Everyone agreed that it was a [b]much[/b] better game the second time through - and I attribute this to the player aids & flow charts I created.

3rd Play:  5 player game.  Made two modifications: Troopers can attack with flamethrowers, and used a d6 instead of d4 for Parasite spawning & movement. It seems the more players, the better!

I gotta try this with a full compliment of 6 players!

RATING: 5
Hard for me to rate after one play.   I generally dislike co-ops games and traitor games, and this is no exception.   I do appreciate that it manages to capture the BSG-like back-and-forth of "you're infected" and "no, YOU are infected".   The rules are rough the first time through.  The game requires one play to get that under your belt so that the players can play the game and not be stuck trying to play the rules.   For an experienced table, this would be a faster BSG alternative, but I'm just not convinced that I want to become an experienced player at this.

Warning: I tried the game with 2-players, which is what you should not do! We played it just to get the gist of it so that we can teach it to other players.

A test-run game. 2 players game; 1 player controlling 2 teams.

Felt kind of easy to infect other player if you're the host/infected. But it could be because we were controlling two teams each (duh!). Gas card is important!

We didn't bother killing the parasites (there were a lot swarming) thus at one point there were no more parasite tokens to be spawned. This obviously because all characters are infected at this point. This goes on and on and we kept exploring just for the sake to reach the computer/control room to do the heat scan so that we can end game.

My impression is still baseless but so far this game was just an okay experience for me. I need to try this game with more players because I seriously think it shines with the max capacity.

Disclaimer : I have a personal quibble with the author but still, a boardgame is a boardgame is... And perhaps he has indeed created something unique, everyone deserves a chance...
Even though I was demo'ing the game at Essen, I never had a chance to actually play it but... unfortunately... I did last weekend. Some friends invited me in, asked me to shed my opinion on the game (as they couldn't see where they were missing out on the "fun" part) and so I eagerly participated, hoping to spot their mistakes in playing. I did print out and learn the latest rules beforehand (2.4 if I'm not mistaken) but it went terribly wrong even with these rules. One player tried to infect the 3 others, failed, we had no more gas cards, and so on... During the game, I couldn't shake off the idea that the author just gathered some ideas and threw them together. I'm even shocked to see that there's one mechanic in there which seems to be taken directly from The Resistance (cards given in secret, shuffled separately), one of my favourite games that excels in originality and fun factor. 
So alas, we didn't enjoy ourselves and those friends were indeed playing it correctly. So I can not rate this highly (what an understatement) and there's not much in there that warrants a purchase or a replay. Perhaps he should stick with just designing the art-part of other boardgames? As people do seem to like that?

Initial impressions out of the box were pretty bad - the stickers/discs are a tough fit and the rules are some of the worst I've ever seen. With the updated rules on BGG (though having to "patch" rules will make me think twice about buying other Stronghold products) the game itself is alright, although a bit of bad luck can ruin a whole game for you (or straight up eliminate you) pretty quickly.

RATING: 9
Despite screwing up the first few plays (flubbing rules that were clearly in the rulebook), I could see the game had promise. On our first correct playthrough, it totally paid off. We've had some absolutely tense moments of paranoia and distrust, and by the third round, trading becomes an act of pure terror. Every time we felt the game was unbalanced, the team that was assumed to be screwed won. That sort of tension can't be understated. A total blast.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
This game totally lived up to its billing, and by that I mean the reputation that I'd read on BGG: no clear way to win the game, multiple rules rewrites immediately upon release. It's a neat idea in that the theme is fun and I like the forced trade mechanic but once the infection starts, there doesn't seem much point to the game. I was second infected and then I infected the other three players. We were sitting there saying, "So we all won... er, lost.. er, won... er..." The guy who was the original host said he "won the most" (kidding) but I was the one who did most of the infecting, so ...? In any case, it didn't feel satisfying in the least. I'll give it another try but I don't see the point in playing something that seems half-baked.

Some tension, but player AP where it served no purpose dragged this intial play and lowered my enthusiasism a great deal. If it had been role-playing and negotiation I would have been intrigued, but alas it t'was but a brain fart.

Did they even play test this at all?

To protect yourself from infection you trade away the resource you need to win the game! 
Kill the infected player and lose all the gas cans and then the game.

Type: Co-op
Time: 40 mins

I was excited to play this Co-op game. It isn't a bad game, just not as good as I hoped.

I like the concept, the graphics, the short duration, and the building of an area that changes with each game. Unfortunately, by several means it is easy to identify the infected person. It is humorous to try to avoid or kill off the infected, but humor isn't enough to encourage repeated game play here.

The components could have been better quality, but then the price would have escalated, and since I don't think this game will see the table often, I appreciate the lower price. It does come in a nice metal box.

I need to play the revised rules posted here on BGG--hopefully it will improve the game. I have to wonder how much this game was play tested before release.

EDIT: New rules have improved the play, rating increased. Here is a first--I actually threw out the old rules.

A relatively simple co-operative game about avoiding infection and defeating the hive mind. I may be missing something, but it feels like it's pretty easy to get infected, and not as much fun when all of the infected players "win" together (minus the last person to get infected). It still feels a little rough around the edges to me.

The foundations upon which Panic Station is built are solid. There certainly is a game in the spreading of the infection and the mounting overall paranoia. The execution in this particular case, however, is lacking in parts, even if you ignore the horrendously bad rulebook and some gaping thematic inconsistencies. In particular, the game seems awfully dependent on the order of equipment cards in the deck and easily breaks down if they don't align properly. (Of course, it also depends a lot on the players, but for games of this ilk I suppose that's par for the course.)

I'd suggest The Resistance as a game that aims for similar effects and manages to pull it off without all the extra baggage and falling apart halfway through.

Multiple owners. Basically you play through the movie The Thing with robot partners. someone is infected and is trying to infect you before you destroy the hive/queen thing. Do you trade with the other guy or do you shoot him?

This was such a confusing game to learn, I've never seen a game work against its own theme so much.  The game starts with a good idea but some of the mechanics ruin what could have been an interesting traitor-style bug hunt.

As is, out of the box Panic Station is a mess.  It offers a great theme, and almost feels like the mechanics should work, but in the end plays like a prototype more than a polished design.  The only Panic I initially felt was if I wasted my money.

I realize there is an extensive faq available, but with so many ambiguities and in game questions this really should have been settled before hitting the street.  

I understand the whole "play within the spirit" of the design, but grinding halts to play, and mechanics that need tweaking to work efficiently all should have been ironed out. It is inexcusable to make so many clarifications post release, and so many typos and omissions in the rule book.

Panic Station has the germ that could make a great game, but seems to have been rushed through development.  I will play again, but with much trepidation and very little enthusiasm.  

Here's hoping the rules 2.0 can fix the game.

Ran quite a few sessions of this game at our store. At first it was a little confusing as written but we worked through it easy enough. The new FAQs and updates will help newbies if they get confused. The tight paranoid feeling of The Thing movie is well captured in this game. Yes, there are ways that players can purposely work the game in situations to all get infected and "win". This is not treated as a win situation in our shop. Also, we always make sure there is a host from the beginning to avoid the "dont search and tiptoe around" method hoping for no host and an easy human win. So many games can be considered "broken" if players "work" the system...  Why set out to try to break a system by playing against the idea of the game? Let's see... in checkers if I let you in to king all your pieces then theoretically we can both win since we're now allies. bleh.   Yea I know, infect for gas trade stopping infection doesnt seem to make logical sense.  So, we just treated it as it was the fossil fuels that had the parasites trapped until mining at the station freed them. So using fuel on them makes them immobile (aka uninfecting)  We have a lot of fun with it.

this is one of the worst games I have ever played. The idea... THE IDEA of it... man, what could have been. But alas, the execution is terrible. First game, the infected guy try to infect the other three players, his attempt failed on all three accounts... that's it for him, no more infecting abilities (not to mention he had all our gas cards - the cards that help the human's meet their end-goal). The second game, everyone is infected early on, everyone continues to walk around and explore... nobody realizes that the game has been over for a half an hour... seriously avoid this game, get Battlestar Galactica - what's that? you have Battlestar Galactica, go play that again (or the Resistance for shorter games) just don't play this steaming pile of garbage that everyone has been raving about.

This game doesn't achieve the backstabbing perfection that can be seen in a game like The Resistance.  However, there is a lot more going on here in terms of tactics and strategy, and the exploration/item-collecting portion of the game can be fairly fun.
And there is a very nice sense of paranoia every time you trade with another player.
As noted, the rules are a bit of a mess.  I downloaded the newest version, asked 3 questions on the forums, and that was enough for us to be good to go with no problems in 2 games.
My group had no problem thinking of winning as the humans being a "preferable" win, and there were no cheesy attempts to join the infected in the hopes of winning more easily.
It's not the best game, but I thought the main complaints against the game were blown out of proportion.

BOTTOM LINE: Panic Station could be great fun with the right group - one that has reached the point where it can effectively "play the table" as well as it can "play the game." But the rules in the box are very leaky and in some places even broken. Rules update v2.2 helps, but is still sloppy in places.

I want to like Panic Station. I think it could be excellent with the right group, but games with new players always give us the feeling, "next time, this game will be better, now that I know how it plays out." But there is never a "next time" because every time I've played, there has been a mix of players who liked the game and players who didn't really like it. So I'm not sure whether I'll ever have the right group for it, and I will probably trade my copy.

I've played it four times. First time was with the rules in the box, plus the clarifications on things like exploring from the BGG forums. In other words, we played it "correctly," but before the starting setup had been changed. Second and third times were also before v2 rules came out, but we modified things so that the host was guaranteed to come out on turn 1 or in the initial deal (still giving everyone one guaranteed gas can). We also rotated the start player Puerto Rico style (so that if you're first this round, you will be last the following round). Fourth time was with the v2.2 rules (no guaranteed gas can, less active parasites but no one misses a turn in the rotation, changes to computer use).

Our first game was fun, but problematic. The locked computer room came up early, and someone performed a heat scan on the second turn of the game. The heat scan showed no one infected. A quick mental count of how many cards we had drawn through searching revealed that the very next card in the deck HAD to be the host card. We realized that we could have easily won as the humans if we just stopped searching, and explored until we found the hive. But that would have made for a very stupid and boring experience. I had already had already drawn ammo and a knife, so I decided to bite the bullet and search a 3-card storage room. Even though everyone knew that I was the host, I won the game. It was a four player game, and I was able to infect another player by forcing multiple trades and running him out of gas cans. We killed the human of the third player, and I had already disposed of the android of the fourth player. So there was only one "real" human left, and he had just two action points. The "good guys" had all the keycards, so the human cowered in a locked computer room, remotely exploring and searching. He eventually finding an energy drink that allowed him to make a run for it past the parasites that were gathering outside his door. (We were playing that his searching spawned parasites in the open part of the card, not in the computer chamber. I think this is incorrect, and we played this way also for out second and third games, but not the fourth.) But although he dodged the parasites, it was going to take him two turns to reach the hive, and we killed him before he got there.

That first game was actually the most enjoyable of my four plays, although I had very mixed feelings because it was clear that the dynamics of assigning the host were not properly analyzed and that a fix was needed. The obvious solution was to make sure that the host card would appear earlier. Another solution would be to require searching on each of the first two turns. A third solution would be to make heat scans unavailable until later in the game (but this could still cause problems for very cautious groups who aren't inclined to search much.

I've played with 4, 5, and 6 players. I didn't like 6 players - there was just way too much downtime. All my games have had at least two or three new players, and I sense that it's a game that can only reach its full potential when everyone has played and fully understands the rules, the strategies, and the mind games. Host players tend to reveal themselves too quickly when they're new players, and often aren't prepared with a good response when someone accuses them of trying to infect them.

You will need to download the latest rules if you want to play that game and print a player aid for each player to make sure everyone understand the rules and what every item does.
The goal of the game is to find the parasite hive and destroy it.  All players work together but at some point during the game, one player become the host and his objective is to protect the hive.  The host can try to infect other player as well.  Everytime a player move in a room with another player he must trade a card (the way to infect other player is by trading card).  It can be pretty stressful.

Art and theme are very dark, but it fits a contagion on a derelict ship well enough.  You start out basically helpless hoping to find weapons and not get infected.  Someone will be infected, however, and attempt to spread.  By playing scans with your actions, you can sometimes deduce what section of the ship the infected are in based on their previous actions.  

The game tin is nice, but very over sized compared to the bits.  I'd say the components leave 80% air.  The box is nice enough you'll likely want to keep it, so maybe you can stuff it with other card and dice games or accessories.

First two games seemed quite unbalanced; it seemed virtually impossible for the "good guys" to lose.  The first game was won in a couple rounds.  The second game took a while longer but was still won handily... one of the "good guys" took one point of damage once.  It's certainly possible that we misread the rules in some way but it seems like things were pretty straightforward.

I downloaded the updated rules. They address a few of the problems. But they don't address the fundamental problem I have with the game. Players are ENCOURAGED to get infected because you win if you are infected so long as you are not the last one infected. This goal does not sit well with me or my group.

RATING: 6
I waited until I've played several times to write this.  There is a good game in here, but I'm not sure its worth all the bullshit you go through to get to it.  This game has a lot of issues.

PROS:

Traitor mechanic is fun, and you spend a lot of the game accusing each other.  It captures this particular aspect of BSG in an hour long game.  I can't really say enough about this, I thought The Resistance really failed in this regard, and werewolf, though fun, doesn't capture it the way BSG did.  Panic Station GOT IT when it played BSG and replicated it on a small scale here VERY well.  Once a couple people get infected there is a TON of paranoia.  These are truly the game's shining moments.  

The rules, although poorly written, are actually very simple once you get everything understood.  Combat is easy, your turn is simple, lots of options usually and its not always easy to see what the best options are.  Overall pretty good decision making.

CONS:

The rules are a total cluster****.  We've got it down now, but if you are trying to learn the game from a rulebook may God have mercy on your soul.  There are a bunch of little pain in the ass exceptions you have to learn just to make the game functional.  You can't trade someone else's blood splat, unless its all you have left.  You can't use any item if you have 5 cards or less.  Don't trade your own blood unless you are infected.  Well you are allowed to, but you never would.  Only in the new rules you can't.  What?  Just don't do it.  

Theme:  its a nearly abstract game.  The theme is just pasted on with no connection to the mechanics.  Why can't the androids use gasoline?  Why can they be infected?  The question go on and on.  Like many others have said, if they do a second edition with fixed rulebook and a hacking re-theme it would probably rub people the right way.  As it is there are a lot of unanswered questions and rules that don't tie in to the theme at all.  

Balance:  4 players makes it too easy on the humans, 6 makes it too east on the infected, and even with 5, it feels like a lot of luck is involved.  Humans draw too many gas cans, infected have a hard game.  Humans fail to draw gas cans, the infected have an easy game.

Overall I have very mixed feelings about the game.

Played at Gen Con.  I actually enjoyed playing, but I don't think I would if I ever played it again.  It is much too fiddly with excess rules.  Worse, though, is the fragility of the ruleset.  There are just too many opportunities for cheating, mistakes, or collusion which could break the game during any given play.  And there just isn't interesting tension in passing a gas can every time to protect your own ass.

I'm a sucker for the traitor mechanic.. and they did a great job with it at panic station. At Battlestar Galactica it is the looming doubt of treachery, and here you have it at the end of a gun. Mixed in with the outer threat of the aliens, love it.
But one should mention that the rules aren't the most natural. They are needed for the "infection mechanic" but if one of the players makes a mistake during the game it could ruin the game. That's why every player should play through the whole infection process one or two times, before starting the game.

______________

With this one it's hard to find people to play with. It's right in the middle-ground.. too complex for a "quick" game, but too light for people who like complex games.. :(

The rules are all but intuitive, should've been tweaked some more.

Although the game has its moments, the mechanics are so terribly at odds with the theme that it simply seems silly. Unarmed marines assault a space station looking for ammo and fuel, "passing gas" to fend off an alien parasite, ad nauseum. The real battle in this game is between the theme and the mechanics, not between marines and alien parasites!

But wait, there's more! In my last play, the game went on and on until we gave up out of boredom. Once we pulled the plug and saw the actual situation, we discovered that neither side could have possibly won. If we hadn't bailed, we might still be playing this borderline broken game!

Potentially infinite games with no possibility for either side to win and no way of knowing this is the case, is simply not indicative of good game design.

On my trade pile since I played [thing=75828][/thing] and [thing=41114][/thing].

The game is broken.  The rules aren't clear but after playing it twice I have figured out what the rules mean.  Putting a card in front of you does not take any actions - using the card takes actions.

When I first played with the owner of a copy of this game, the owner said you spend 1 action to put something in front of you - turns out this is not the case.  It never takes an action to put something in front of you - only to use it if it has a 1x on it (or a hand with a 1 etc.).

A co-operative game with a traitor, similar to Shadows over Camelot or Battlestar Galactica, the difference being that the traitor can force others on to their side.

This sounded like a really intriguing idea that I wanted to love. The game itself is one of the most utterly horrible, broken and boring games I've ever played.

It doesn't work at all well as a simple dungeon crawl, or as a tactical battle, or as a hand management game, and the one hook it might have had - the paranoia - also simply doesn't work (even in the updated rules).

Nice idea but needs a serious injection of fun, better win conditions (if you're playing to win you're playing it wrong? what the frak?), better and more suspensful exploration, a way for the host to attempt infection without being blindingly obvious, the list goes on - basically a complete overhaul of every single rule to make this even remotely playable.

RATING: 5
Traitor-based co-ops aren't really my thing, so it's hard for me to judge which ones are better than others.  Still, this is a very interesting idea. I think the idea of having traitors pass cards in trades to others, secretly increasing the number of infected as time goes on, is pretty brilliant.  I'm also pleased that it, like The Resistance, plays fairly quickly.  

I do think the gas-can-as-infection-nullifier is a little clunky and introduces the possibility for players to make mistakes. I also found that the sheer number of little social interactions among players made it impractical for the infected players to remain secret in the one full game of this I played.  (1.5 plays)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Well. Okay. So hidden traitor games don't appeal to me that much to begin with, so that was a strike against it, and the first time I tried to play, something was wrong with the rules and we all got stuck next to the door, so that wasn't great either.  But there's more to evaluate the game on than that.  I think the idea of passing around traitor status by secretly trading cards is kind of brilliant, but the execution isn't so great.  There's a lot of potential for confusion, mostly stemming from the gas can exception (Oh! This is a virus! Am I infected? Did I trade a gas can away? Gah! Let me see!), and at the end of the game it's possible to create a situation where it's more or less mathematically impossible for one side to win and all the identities are already out. Meh. Disappointing. (1.5 plays)

Based on the rules 1.0, which are pretty much broken:
The game didn't get to me, the way I hoped it would. It didn't feel like playing the game, rather than the system.
I appreciate all the work that is done to address the issues. Might give this another chance, when the rules are properly fixed and tested. First impressions are still hard to replace.

This game breaks in so many ways. There is numerous conventions that groups can fall into, and many of them will result in the game grinding to a halt.

There are many defenses from stalwart fans explaining that the game is better with expansions, or how it only works if people "play it right", whatever that means. That may be true, but I generally buy games in the hopes that they will hold up to repeated play, not fall apart under the weight of it unless I and my entire group support it.

Its ok.  It felt like there were WAY too many gas cans.  The infected never had any opportunity to gain against the 5 of us because we ALL had gas cans.

The deck probably needs stacking to ensure only 1/2 or less of the cans come out in the initial hands.

Don't get me started on the "suspend dis-belief" flamethrower on person but no gas, human can't shoot gun rules... -1 for that.

RATING: 7.5
First off, download the 2.1 rules, much much clearer and will help you avoid the potential pitfalls that some of the low-raters have had. Of course its group dependant like all these types are but maybe even slightly more so this time and the 'system' is somewhat sensitive, count on game 1 as a learning game. 

Most are going to get what they expect here, a traitor game in 45mins - 1hour; think shorter BSG or Resistance combined with a Dungeon Crawl. I think the theme complaints are silly, sure there is a stretch here or there, big bluddy deal, overall the theme is strong and one of the high points, if you've seen the movie you won't be disappointed with the theme.  

I'm not totally sold on the mechanics, yet. I need to play more to make up my mind but I do have a hesitation or two right now, will end up between a 7 and 9 for me depending on if they fade into the background enough to let the 'game' blossom and/or augment the experience (I think they will). 

The forced trade mechanic is the cool part of the game for sure, since its a 'hidden' trade and the main inducer of the tension and paranoia in the game. As a Human, you are always worried about getting "infected" through a trade and you will usually face a tough decision on whether or not to trust someone [i]each[/i] trade. Come time to trade, you have to choose whether or not to give up your only protection (gascans) from future infection AND also the one thing the Humans need to win the game. The gascans are precious, and cunning infectors will suck them away from you...  

Best with 6 for sure, then 5. I will be modifying my copy to play 8 or 9, not sure if the game will handle more, in a good way. It can also be noted the system is pretty open and easily tweakable; like playing a slightly more competitive game for VP's or even a 3 game campaign (both of which I posted in variant section) or playing a preset scenario with additional or slightly altered goals, some good ideas have been posted and many more will come I'm sure. 

-----------

Hidden Identity is one of my fav mechanics and this game seems to make great use of it. Read rules and preordered, likely a 9 for me, could even be a 10 if it plays anything like the session reports indicate and no issues surface. I really liked BSG but not the length so this will be a great alternative.

There's something unsatisfying about the mechanics of this game.  Maybe I just don't get it, but it seems like there would be times that it would be beneficial when you're not  yet infected to try to get infected instead of trying to win for your side.  I'll probably give it another chance, though.  I usually like cooperatives.

Panic Station didn't really leave a very good first impression: One player described it as "a paranoia type game, without the paranoia". Initial rating based on two four-player games - perhaps the game is more interesting with more players, but I guess I will never know.

Not really a competitive game, despite the presence of victory conditions: Players actually trying to achieve the victory conditions discover that this might lead to boring, anticlimactic games, and it seems sub-optimal play is required for the game to really work. That might be OK in an RPG, but not in a boardgame with strict rules, victory conditions and winners and losers. Yes, having fun is the main goal of playing (even for people trying to win), but when playing a competitive game, the whole context is "... while trying to win the game". Nothing kills the whole point of playing boardgames easier than people playing for different reasons than trying to do their best to win.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (July 2012)

I was expecting a great game, the art, title and theme were very exciting to me. It has my favorite mechanism (hidden roles) so I was hugely disappointed with the game play. I feel there is a good game in here, however the rules feel under developed to me and when I play this it begins to be boring pretty soon. I have never read any version of the rules but I will do so in the future.

My main issue is that it is pretty easy to infect people, also most of the people I played with WANTED to be infected, and that degenerated in a game where there was only one human alive and all other players were infected. IMO the game has not defined clearly both sides motivations nor a way to enforce the “spirit” of the game, I really hate that all players can lose (infected), and thus win (except the last player). If you begin as a human, you should do your best to win the game as a human, not changing teams at mid game. There should be a limit of how many infected players could be at the same time. I’m not sure how to fix this, but this break the game for me. When this has happened (only one human player left) the game has dragged on taking a lot of time, the human has virtually no chance at winning so he goes to a corner of the map (trying to lock himself up) and stays there until we kill him. Very boring and anticlimactic.

The heat scans are great to play. Very fun and atmospheric.

A broken (or fragile at best) game for me, still it can be fun with the right group or when there is more than one human alive. I believe there is a way to rescue this game so I will be playing it again (besides many people in my game groups have this).

Probably the worst co-op/traitor game that I've played by a wide margin.  I was tempted to give it a 1 since it has some major issues.  We played with the 4th revision of the rules and it still had those main issues.  There are some cool ideas on how to infect others but it was pretty obvious who the dangerous people where but no way to avoid them except by giving away the only thing you could win the game with.

The feel of this game is very different from other traitor games due to the dynamic alliances which is refreshing.

It is a little bit fiddly due to the layer of mechanics required to support secret infections: in particular, there's no way to verify that a person has successfully guarded against an infection. Expect the first few games to be "ruined" by misplays which cannot be corrected due  to all the hidden information, especially if you're playing with newbies. This somewhat limits the accessibility of this game.
 
There are also concerns with the victory condition, as described in the threads on the forum.

Needs a few more plays to see if how the metagame evolves

edit: Game experience can vary very wildly from one game to another... sometimes it's really easy, sometimes it's really tense...

RATING: 4
A fun, but clunky little game. Edge cases pop up all over the place that don't seem particularly well-handled in the rule book. My favorite is when the infectors run out of their three infections, the infectors are forced to flee because their gas cans will get stolen otherwise. Oh, and making the little critters teleport away from you when there aren't any left in the chit bank is a good one too. Still, it's fast and allows fun interaction between players. I like it.

It is a fun co-op game where you are trying to put out the infection. Someone is the infector and they try to infect others. You start out paranoid of being infected, but it is nice that if you get infected you are switched to the infected team so you still have a chance to win.

I went into the game with the wrong expectations.  I expected a game akin to The Resistance, but I can see that this is more of an experiential thing, not as much talk.  I wanted to like the game, but it definitely seems more fragile and deserves another couple plays before making a final call.  I like these types of games, and I like that it doesn't last too long, but I just need more experience.

On a side note I was happy to see the BGG community win out on this game.  I am starting to get really annoyed with game designers that are also very active BGG users and feel the need to cover most threads involving their game.  Of course this is welcome when covering rules questions, but lately there have been more designers and publishers that are too defensive when it comes to discussing their games.  

This one in particular worked out well.  At the beginning, negative reports were dismissed with an attitude that I took to be a "you're not playing it right" response, even if that's not how the designer intended it.  But as the concerns involving the rules kept coming in, it became apparent that the deficiencies were on the part of the designer/publisher.  The myriad rules updates attest to this.

I was very tempted to lower my rating based on the Horrible rule book, the flimsy cards and the lack of a standard box. (Game comes in a tin.)  Rated on those items it would be a 5.  
(Addition) The updated and much better rules are on BGG in the files.  Much improved rules plus FAQ, but still not perfect.  I'm still not a fan of that tin box.

The game itself is quite good and I know we will play it relatively often.  It reminds me of a cross between Sucking Vacuum and The Resistance.  Those are both games that we have had loads of fun with.
(Addition) I'm gonna house rule that this game is only played with 5 or 6 players.  There is also a learning curve on how to be sneaky as an infected player.

I owned this game, and played it 5-6 times.  It seems awesome, but failed every time.  The revised rules, which seem good, are clunky.

Acquired in Maths trade Feb 2012

Nice suspense filled co operative game. Played with both 5 and 6 players. It isn't as good as Battlestar Galactica, but then it only takes around 45 minutes to play. Much to admire in a design that can play in such a short time frame. First two games resulted in tight affairs with the infected outnumbering the non infected, but still ending in the hive getting burned. The second game in particular was a skin of the teeth win. Looking forwards to playing this one again. A definite non trade as it went down so well.

Excellent co-op/traitor game. Be sure you're playing with the online, revised ruleset, which fixes many issues with the printed rules.

The game is challenging for both the human team and the parasite host. In most of my plays, there's been a healthy sense of paranoia as you play.

If you're a fan of co-op/traitor games, I highly recommend this. Best played with 6. Do not play with 4 unless everyone playing has played it before.

I love John Carpenter's The Thing (1982) as well as a game with a hidden traitor element, so it comes as no surprise that the theme touches very close to me. However, the presentation and game play leave a lot to be desired with this one. This game's rating could be a point lower or higher based on more plays, but I think right now for the actions you are able to take and decisions you are able to make in the game that I'd rather just play Betrayal at the House on the Hill.

Hmm, this is a weird one. I kind of like the idea of the game and especially that it is designed to give you a BSG-like experience. The biggest issue is that the rules are somewhat obtuse and therefore it is hard to get a working game going. The infection rules are also quite volatile and it happens very easily that the game converges to funny states. On top of that, there a lot of thematic disconnects that kind of kill the atmosphere of the game. The real pity is that I think that these disconnects would have been avoidable...

Alright, though a little 'clunky' for what it is.

Played with the v2.0 rules and it was better. Still seems to have some rough edges and too much rests on the first encounter.

Thos GAS cannisters seem the problem. If everyone does GasGas trades then they are safe. As soon as someone doesn't give you a Gas in a trade they are suspicious. Then with the scanner you can simply check them out.

If the host gets lucky then it may make for a good game but if the humans have even a slight sense of logic then they should be pretty safe.

* First - ask "Who has a gas cannister?"
* Now only trade with those people
* Always trade GasGas, if they don't give you a cannister, they are the infected.
* If someone trades with someone who hasn't got gas, they are the infected.

Is that it?

Wanted to like this one, but found too many thematic issues (Humans can't shoot? If you infect the android the human is also infected somehow and vice versa? You use gasoline that you find IN the base for the flamethrower you brought to disinfect the base? Why would trading gasoline protect you from infection?) that I couldn't hand-wave away. Also disliked the character art and the fact that there's a chance that you can potentially never unlock security doors.

Plays reasonably well, but this one could have been better.

RATING: 6
The idea of Panic Station is great. Humans are trying to find the hive with their android counterparts, burn it and hope that all the humans don't get infected in the process. Thematically, this game is great. The implementation however, is lacking.

First- The Rules. You may want to get a copy of Rosetta stone to decipher the rules. for every rule, there is an exception. For example, if you search a room the first time you get an item, the second time you get an item but it spawns a parasite but not where you are you have to roll to determine its location, unless there is no where for it to go then it stays with you. Oh man... rough.

Second- I don't like the table talking to where you can say. "yea he just tried to infect me" or "I know its that guy because he didnt try to give me gasoline" While I can see how it can add tension, it almost spoils the complete mystery of the game. 

Third- The restrictions of characters makes no sense. A human can't shoot a gun but the robot can? A robot can't set fire only a human can? A robot can infect someone with blood? Makes no sense to me.

On a side note, the copy of the game we got, brand new, was missing 2 wooden pieces, so we had to improvise. Annoying. 

I think once the wrinkles in this game get ironed out it will be great!

Definitely the game purchase I regret the most. Probably the only game I own that I would absolutely not play again, ever.

The rules are poorly written, thematically illogical, and generally just incompetently executed and weird.

When I introduced it to my friends, every time I told them a rule, they looked at me like I was crazy. "Only robots can use guns? Seriously?" "I can't NOT trade with a person unless I try to kill them? WTF?"

It's like the designer couldn't be bothered to have his rules make sense, or come up with a theme that would better fit his crazy rules.

In any case, the whole thing is just dumb, and I'll never again listen to the friendly local game store owner who convinced me to buy it.

The game idea and the main mechanics are absolutely fantastic. I love this game. But unfortunately, the game is only designed as a framework for role playing.

If those improvements were made, I would give it a 10.

The best way to play this game is as a fun, socializing strategy game.  It also has some tactics towards the endgame when Humans vs Infected/Host are trying to determine a path of victory by destroying/salvaging The Hive.  There are lots of little rules here and there so it's best to be taught from an experienced player.  The heart of the game lies in determining who is lying or telling the truth and reading other players poker face.  Are they Infected?  Or are they Human?  Whom do you trust enough to trade cards with?  For the humans, how do you find the Hive and combine three gas cans to explode and win?  For the Host or Infected, how do you lure others' trust and infect them and keep them away from finding the Hive?  

If this game is played with quiet, reserved or non-social types of players, I doubt they would enjoy it enough?  A mixture is good.

If you can past the the horrendous rule set and figure out how to play, this game is a blast with the right group.  If you don't like games with a traitor element, stay far away.  In this one I really appreciate how the parasite can really spread his influence and force people to change teams with the trading card mechanism.  I know some worry that there is an issue with humans always just trading gas cards and the first person not to is a parasite, but if you are agreeing to this right off the bat, then I wonder if you are truly playing in the spirit of the game.  Besides, do the same every time and you get predictable and in these types of games, you want to avoid this!  In my book, this will easily surpass Shadows Over Camelot as this plays quickly and is in a smaller box.

It may have just been the group but when people don't talk this game gets very boring very quickly.  Half the fun is supposed to be the constant bantering as you accuse people of being infected.

i really liked this game.
all the suspense and tension and horror.  very thematic

the game do suffer from some bugs and players have to have the right attitude to enjoy the game.  It is not a Eurogame, but thematic game.  You play for the experience.

There are some problems with 6 players esp if the infector is last in turn order.  It is a big disadvantage for him.

Be paranoid. Everyone really is out to get you even if you are on their side sometimes. A sort of cooperative game where the traitor can "recruit" other traitors from amongst your friends. Once things start going downhill it goes fast. If you suspect someone stay away from them! I think I still like Battlestar Galactica for my Co-op with traitor but this one is good if you don't have time for that.

Outstanding intensity, great theme, and short makes this game a must.  My biggest complaint is that the game is error prone. Players must not make the mistake of using the wrong card when doing a scan, they must also not make the mistake of handing out another player's infection card by mistake instead of their own, and must be clear on infecting/blocking infection via gaz. These mistakes have ruined 3 of my games therefore it is crucial to be clear with everyone how the infection mechanism works using examples.

I never played a game that swung this widely in how much it is fun to play. Some games were just awesome, while the next one might be just aweful. In the end, I don't like games where a dead end is possible (in one game, all the different options to open doors were outside of the area were I and some other players were locked in, so that we couldn't do anything), so the rating is pretty low.

The most godawful game I've played in the last few months.  This one is so complicated and convoluted I don't think any of the 4 players enjoyed it.  Took forever to finish, and I was falling asleep between turns because there was just no excitement at all.  Maybe I need another play, but I am hoping to avoid that for at least a year or longer.

A game that at first seemed broken (due to the many little rules to remember), is now one of the game that I try to pull out every gaming night. With a strong 'Aliens' theme and each game lasting around 60 minutes, the experience you get in each game makes me think I'm re-living a movie experience. It is a game for those who love the feeling of paranoia, trust and betrayal.

Note: For my gaming group, we play with the 2nd host variant all the time now. It makes the game better, more challenging, and more paranoid.

The greatest disappointment of 2011 releases. I've expected this game because I love this idea. However the game seems to be underdeveloped and not tested well. In each play the game has behaved in unpredictable way in first rounds. 

In first case all humans except the host have been killed very early by parasites before they undertook any action. Despite sufficient amount of weapons and ammunition humans have been eliminated due to unfortune dice rolls. Due to the rules humans can't defend against parasite upon its entrance to the location but must wait until their action. So if parasite enters the location it always hurts all present alive individuals who are always defenseless (they have to wait for their action to defend). With bad luck with dice this leads to quick elimination with no possibility to react. 

In second play two humans staying in the location already occupied from all 4 sides have been drawing together 6 location cards per round thus leading quickly to ending up the deck and drawing the cocoon card. They've been placing location cards in most desirable location because they couldn't place them in adjacent location and the game has finished after 20 minutes with no satisfaction. 

Regretfully one extra point for fantastic box ;-)

Let's be honest: The forced trading is gamey. Not to mention the fact that humans can't shoot guns, androids can't use the flamethrower, the humans don't bring enough gas for the flamethrower, the androids don't (necessarily) bring guns or ammo, infecting one teammate automatically infects the other, etc. Gamey. [i]Extremely [/i]gamey. The amount of hand-waving required to buy into the thing is absurd. But if you are willing to do so, the game does seem to work. The revised rules are absolutely necessary to make this game fun and playable. But once adopted, the game can become a frantic, paranoia-laced romp.  Enthusiastic players may turn into raving lunatics when they begin to suspect someone--or want to deflect suspicion away from themselves. Or they may put on their best poker faces. Who knows? There are lots of possibilities for play acting and sabotage.

Looking forward to giving this one a go as it gained a lot of hype at Essen. Sounds it like it has a couple of design choices that don't quite work thematically, but that shouldn't make it any less fun. Deserved a little better than a tin box though, which seems to make the game appear a little tacky/cheap presentation-wise. I know this isn't the case by any means, but it still gives off that vibe.

RATING: 3
Little panic, weak aliens, have to shoot you 4 times, nonsense of protecting oneself with a gas can, awkward rules about placing map cards, not knowing your own ship layout, only one of your two characters can shoot... this just didn't work.  Plus, the rantings of the designer left a poor taste in my mouth.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Interesting game, but some of the logical inconsistencies make it a hard sell. Mainly, why can you trade items between your two characters if they are on other sides of the map? Why can humans not carry guns, but they can carry flame throwers? Why can robots fire weapons, but humans can't? I know it's all done to increase gameplay decisions, but do the artificial rules serve only to cover up for thin mechanics and gameplay? Sometimes I'm OK with artificial rules, but these are too logically inconsistent to me, and sour the experience. With all that said, if you can get passed the issues with the mechanics, the gameplay is tense and interesting, but needs the right crowd.

Best w/6, 5-6:

Teaching this game can be wonky since there are so many apparent thematic holes, and on top of that if someone plays incorrectly they can ruin the game, but....it's still a lot of fun and can be banged out in 30-45 minutes.  Yes, there are better games with a traitor aspect (Battlestar comes to mind), but this game moves quick and has lots of tense moments.  I enjoy it.  UPDATE :  this game works well with the right group.  I just need to find that group.  They must like hidden roles, take that, bluffing, and be ok with cumbersome rules.

As a gaming experience, I would say Panic Station  is terrific fun. Yes, we had to work through to clarify some of the rules which definitely could have been more clear. So, yes, the rules need tightening up and I look forward to the revised version. There is also potential for the team to “game” things by not searching too many rooms and hope to survive with minimum defensive items to get to the Hive but that is really against the spirit of the game and playing by the spirit of the game is important to enjoy it. Having said that, I’m hoping the rules revision will make “gaming” things more obviously counterproductive. Also, I would certainly recommend including the suggested rule change of including the Host card in the initial distribution of cards so that you are guaranteed a Host is in play early enough but also not allowing the Host to start spreading the infestation until at least 2 rounds have passed. Simple.

I definitely had the right crowd playing with me and we had a great time laughing, accusing, threatening, all in a great social spirit and we had a LOT of fun. The system worked well for the most part, played fast despite a few rules niggles, which common sense agreement soon sorted out, the threats from the bugs and from other players was tense and as the remaining humans realized they didn’t know who to trust, it was all quite both tense and hilarious. Lots of shouting and laughs. The tension level is brilliant and really adds to the game as you worry whether this card swap will be the one that does you in. Again, not a game for everyone, but well suited for those who enjoy the social side and won’t take it all too seriously.

As a game design, I think it will evolve a bit and tighten up which it needs to. The earliest version of the rules, from what I have read were not broken, in my view, but surely needed clarification. The version 1.3 that I have worked pretty well. I suspect that this will be a “marmite” game with many who love it and some who just don’t like it at all. Those who claim it’s broken, certainly in the current version, make me think that they may be more fond of Euro/analysis games and maybe just aren’t comfortable with a bit of ambiguity and that’s fine. They just shouldn’t waste their time with more social games looking for something that isn’t there.

Overall, I rate Panic Station as a very good game. I do wonder if it was a bit rushed and hence the rules weren’t tight and clear enough or whether the play testing let the designer down a little.  Regardless though, the updated rules are coming which I am very pleased about but as it stands, this is still a very good game and I really like the theme, tension, mechanics, art, etc. It all worked very well for me.

Broken. Simply one of the worst games I've played.  Early in the game my human was shot dead with just one other player's actions, then 5 of the 6 players were infected leaving my android character alone as the sole non-infected character (obvious because I never traded cards in the game) about halfway into the game.  Well this sucked because no one wanted to find out using the computer scanner how many were left uninfected, which means the game didn't have a distinct end and could go on and on.  Oh and it was an infected individual that put the scanner room behind security doors and had the only access card so it was inaccessible anyway to anyone else.  My android eventually found the hive but had no way of dealing with it (only humans can fry the hive).  So it was turn after turn of frustration for all players.  There were a good number of other details that just added insult to injury.  It had no clear end, no clear winner, don't really see how the non-infected players really could win the game, on and on...

The gal next to me told me afterwords she had tried it again because the first time she played it was so incredibly bad she thought it must've been just that one experience.  Nope, just as bad the second time around she says.

(in all fairness, this was based off my one play, though we did have a rep from the game publisher showing us the game so at least we didn't play it wrong)

Panic Statin has problems. It feels particularly like it should work as a pseudo-role-playing-game, but the theme is constantly disrupted by obvious gameplay contrivances. Meanwhile, the traitor mechanics tend to swing wildly in favour of one team or the other very early on, requiring a long but pointless slog to the end of the game. 

Rejected.

RATING: 7
I think this game has a lot of potential.  It starts off as a cooperative game with 4 to 6 players working together.  Eventually someone gets infected by the parasites and then secretly starts trying to infect the others on the team.  The tension is strong and the artwork is nicely evocative of the theme for the most part.

Some groups will have a little trouble with the logic of the trading mechanic, and there is the possibility of player elimination.

As much as I love this game, I think the choice made by the publisher/designer to make it language independent was a poor one.  The images on the cards give you very little clue about what they actually do, so we were passing the rule book around heavily in throughout the game.  I recommend this game, but choose cautiously for your group.

RATING: 3
Theory.  Oh, how I love a game in theory.

Let's start with the rulebook, which needs a ton of clarification out of the box.  The Android-Trooper split adds a level of tension with players but completely breaks logic with the "cards transfer upon death" thing.  And it seems pretty clear after two plays that it's very difficult to infect others, what with everyone transferring gas as a defense mechanism and only 3 cards to infect others.

I like the idea of this game so much.  It's the execution that falls on its face.  Even after 2 major and 3 minor rulebook updates in less than 2 weeks -- seriously?  was this game ever blind-playtested by strangers? -- it's clear there's still bugs in the system that need to get ironed out.  I'll revisit the game in a few months; but right now the game is simply, clearly, not finished.

The initial idea is very good (and could have lead to a BSG in one hour), and the parasitism more clever than a basic cylon/felon mechanism with no decision. Sadly in practice, the game is not finalized enough in its rules and leads to weird situations. Maybe I have to wait for Panic Station Reloaded.

RATING: 4
Fails on so many levels that it sure looks like the game was published mainly because of the designer's massive hype campaign.

Shows severe lack of playtesting, particularly blind playtesting. The game works only if played like the designer wants you to, not when played like gamers try to. The rulebook is poorly structured, uses inconsistent terminology and implicit declarations, and generally fails at communicating the rules or game structure in any helpful way. 

Multiple essential game situations where a careless player can completely ruin everyone's deductions and pretty much the entire session: Trading, heat scan, having to remember to resolve a parasite immediately when drawn.

Multiple ideas that make no thematic sense whatsoever.

Really poor graphic design: When the cards are in your hand, all you see is black. The cards also have no hints about their function at all, and there aren't any player aids included either.

I think outings of this might fall under the category of experiences rather than games. It can happen that you do everything right (of your limited options anyway) and end up losing simply because the infector chose you last to trade with. One person starts as the infector and his job is to trade his infection cards with the non-infected. That infection will only work if the non-infected trader doesn't play a defense card at the same time. It's a bit like trading disasters in Civilisation, except here the game, sorry, the experience, is done in 30 minutes or so. Anyway, all the infected win (except the last one) if everyone's infected. Meanwhile the non-infected are exploring the board (adding cards) as fast as possible to get the Hive card out, and win if they can blast it with 3 defense cards (except you gotta trade 'em away to stop being infected). That's about how hard the decisions are - 4 action points to be used to move, explore, pick up a card or whack someone if you're lucky enough to pick up ammo (characters have 4 hit points). Killing everyone else probably seems a good idea regardless of infection! Anyway, it's tactically light. Enjoying this comes down to playing for the drama and accepting what happens. I'm just not sure it's capable of providing an equally satisfying experience for all players.

Super tense fun !! Thematic card game !! A light cross between The Resistance and something from the Space Hulk universe. It truly felt like [b]John Carpenter's The Thing put to a board/card game[/b]. 

Fiddly, but forgivable rules and thematic blunders. Just find a good group and [b]PLAY THIS THING!![/b] (see what I did there?) This is a game I wish I could play more often.

After several tries, this game simply doesn't make it. I tried it with people who really love traitor mechanics and hidden alliance games. But they would just look at the game incredulously... so would I. Nothing makes sense here and the rules don't help... at all.... on the contrary. This is a new record holder for the title of worst rules ever! Friedemann Friese! Make way, for here is Panic Station!

The only reason I don't give it a 1 is because the theme is really appealing. But that's it. I dislike the art style but was willing to overlook that, I dislike that the "tiles" are cards and not actual tiles but I was willing to overlook that, I hate the rules but was willing to overlook that... the game didn't bring it so all of the above imploded. A convoluted game that has several flaws. I even read the infinitely improved Pegasus version of the rules (in German) and it doesn't save the game. What's with "The last player to be infected looses the game, all other win", so I asked... how will we know? The answer in the rules: "players will have to discuss the last turns they played to determine that"... why do we have to be bothered doing that??

If I want to discuss the last few turns it's because I want to discuss strategy or whatever... not because the rules tell me that I have to to determine who won and who didn't... Sorry... nice idea... bad game.

Excellent game!  Make sure you use the newest rules for initial startup.  The host (traitor) must find a balance of being too aggressive (getting discovered) vs being too passive.  The growth potential of the host is what makes this game great.  This game despite it saying is a 4-6 player game is actually only a 5-6 player game.  Playing with 4 doesn't work out well.

1 play so far with game breaking rule mistakes (multiple trade with same character). I might play this again with correct and newer rules, but I am not in hurry. And why? Because the original winning condition sucks - if everyone gets infected then all players win. Where is the motivation to play your part as a human survivor? Rules should support the thematic play not vice versa. Also the mechanics do not let traitors stay hidden really and this means paranoia effect does not come into play that much.

Maybe it´s not fair to rate it since my only rating is based on one wronly played session, but this rating implicates also the lack of wish to try it again.

This game sold very well and was sold out almost immediately. This made I had some high expectations when I could finally play this. My first play however was a very big disappointment. From the mimics of Kelly when she got her first cards and her being keen to trade with other people, it was from the start clear who was the host. However if you don't have any ammo or don't get new petrol-cards, you can block it once when she tries to infect you, but the second time you're infected. Will try it once with 5 or 6 players, but don't think this is a keeper.

Bought this thinking it would be similar to Battlestar Galactica in game play, but it wasn't for my group.  The rules are muddled and confusing.

Extremely disappointing. The interesting part of the game was over after a couple rounds when I found out who the host was as he tried to infect me unsuccessfully. After that it turned into a move-and-shoot. I am told this game depends on "playing correctly" and it didn't grab me at all. A game needs a hook if it requires multiple plays with the same group in order to shine. This game doesn't have one.

God knows I do love my traitor games and while this is not the innovative and revolutionary game some people thought it might be, it is a solid entry in the genre. The rules are terrible, counter-intuitive and have not been proofread, but the gameplay is still good and fun so don't let that deter you and look our for some good reference sheets and rules on the geek. Only played this once so cannot really say how much is strategy and how much is just randomness and luck, I felt there was a lack of control over some elements but maybe that is just because I never played it before. Good one.

Ive been told theres a new printing of the rulebook that fixes some of my issues with the game but without changing quite a few of the bare bones mechanics i cant see this being completely unbroken. Too many chances for a completely anti-climactic game to occur. The human players can exploit the rules on the scanner in the first couple rounds of the game to 100% narrow down the infected player. Not a lot of game left to play after that happens.

Players explore some ill-defined government base seeking out an alien egg-thing so they can blow it up with petrol cans. They improvise an explosion with petrol cans but they bring sentient combat droids with them as support.
One of the players is a host, an infected alien who can seek to infect the other players and tries to interfere, secretly, with the other players strategy. 
The game has some interesting mechanisms and refreshing ideas on the co-operative game with hidden traitor set up but it can be a bit clunky in places.

While the game could be played with fewer players (perhaps to get a feel for the game play), it really needs 6 players to shine.  With 6P, the board is very claustrophobic, the items are spread out amongst more players, and the atmosphere of the game is more apparent.

Only (minor) downside to the game is that there is no checks and balances for incorrect play, so it is important that players understand the infection mechanism and when infection cards can be traded.  But then again, it is only a game, so if things get too messed up, just start over and try again.

This game along with The Resistance are by far my favorite of the traitor games.  Panic Station is very thematic, feeling a lot like the movie The Thing.  It can drag on a bit if people get wounded and have 1 or 2 actions per turn.  The rules are not well written, so you really want to read through them carefully and decide how to rule on all possible eventualities before teaching the game.

    Rating based on just one play, but the game just seemed like a bag of rules and options shaken up and thrown onto the table.  The map tiles we drew were a mess.  Nothing would fit.  We pretty much just filled in rules as we went along and the game ended in a degenerate state where everyone but one was infected but none of us knew it.  It was a session of "let's play pretend."  

    All that said, there was a bit of alcohol in the mix and a LOT of goofing off and throwing jokes around, so it was a good time.  I don't know if that was the game so much as the people, and I don't know if the game could sustain it over multiple plays.  But I had fun playing, so all in all it was a good experience.

    Again, after just one play, so take it for what it's worth.  In my opinion coming away from one game this critter needs to go back into the oven for another 20 minutes.  Maybe 40.

It's rare that I don't like a thematic game, but I wasn't impressed.  Most likely due to the fact that you need the "right" group for this game to be "good". Game designer's over-defensive/passive-aggressive comments are also huge put-down.  


Edit:  Reluctantly played the 3rd time.  Wanted to give it a shot again, maybe with a different group and a person who knows all the rules would be fun.  Sad to say that no one had fun at the table.  Convulated rules and anti-themematic elements just signals that it's badly designed.

Too much trouble to find the right group with the right settings and hoping for the right game so I can maybe have fun like the designer claimed.  Going back to games like Shadown Hunters and BSG where ANY group I've played with at ANY experience level usually have a blast.

I was the host in the first game. This is an exciting role ... all others should be paranoid. But I am not sure if the game is really that good like it seemed. Of course I like deduction games. Hopefully this game is balanced, unfortunately I believe that it's hard for the human side to win the game. Maybe I'm wrong, I'll see it within the next games.
One obvious critic: one card hand for two characters, even if they are not in the same room. And why can only androids shoot while humans are predestinated to flame the hive? Conditioned by the gameplay mechanic.

EDIT: Decided to give this game away because it developed to a rather seldom choice of what to play. The gameplay feels juddery and somehow half-baked. Traded for "Nuns on the Run".

RATING: 5
Rating after only one play. I feel this rating is particularly subject to change should I get the chance to play again. There is a strong psychological element in this game that seems to be the main source of the enjoyment that players would derive. In the game that I played, most players didn't know each other - and many were learning for the first time - so I think it's possible that the psychological part of the game didn't get much chance to come together. The game is essentially a 2 v 2 team game where players all start on one team and can at any point be transfered over to the other team. I'm not sure how I feel about this yet. I'm not a fan of pure coops. Since this game is to a large degree cooperative, my personal bias could be affecting my reaction negatively. If you like cooperative games then you would have the opposite bias. I still remain curious about this game and would like to try it again.

A thematic mess of a game.  This is a game I see as being inspired by the classic horror film The Thing From Another World and gameplay-wise from one of the haunts in Betrayal at the House on the Hill.

The first game I played of this went too quick (not a terrible thing) with an easy human victory, the second went way too long (a terrible thing) and we spent as much time talking about how the rules worked as we did paying attention to the game.

It's a hidden team game where a secret infected player attempts to infect others to bring them onto their team, but I don't feel the gameplay AT ALL.

There's not a lot of game here.  It's more fun than Death Angel (which it sort of felt like), however there are much sleeker games in this genre.  While it DOES bring something new to the table, it doesn't do it particularly well.

There are much better hidden team games out there, I see no reason to play this.  Playing this feels like carrying a bale of hay without a rope.  All players have to really work to keep the bale together to make it to the end. 

Edit: Rating lowered from 4 to 1, I won't ever play this game again, and after reflecting on it, it is broken.

They made [i]John Carpenter's The Thing[/i] into a board game! Kinda!

I haven't had this much paranoia since I played Battlestar Galactica. That part is awesome.

The less-awesome parts:
:star: This game is [b]clunky[/b].
:star: It can be hard for the main infected to infect others. Once that happens, I can see the game taking off and being very hard for the humans. But in both games the Infected couldn't get anyone else infected, and once they've blown through their 3 cards, it's pretty much over for them.
:star: There are a TON of things that make no thematic (or common) sense at all. The game asks you to just hand-wave it away and ignore it. That just makes it all seem sillier.
:star: The game box says 40 minutes to play, but its pants are clearly on fire.
:star: The rules book isn't very good.

I think there should be another infected card in the deck somewhere. And if the guy already infected gets it, he can give it to someone else and they can't block it. Of course, this might swing the game in the bad guys' direction. But as-is, if someone has two gas cans, the game is an auto-lose for the bad guys? Seems bad. It's just too fragile.

The idea of this game is awesome. I think it failed in the execution. 
------------------------------------------------
Update: Played again two weeks after our first play. 
:star: We played by the 2nd edition rules--just like we did last time. 
:star: Everyone knew how to play. 
:star: I'm not sure how long we played, but it was at LEAST 90 minutes. 

I stand by my assertion that this is just too fragile. 

Luke had a Body Scanner card early on and chose to scan Stalker. Had he chosen to scan me instead, I (as the Host) was screwed. It would have been my word against Luke's--and everyone would know the Host was either me or Luke. Could I overcome it? Maybe, but now I have to spend time (a very precious thing in this game) convincing people it's Luke and not me. And the clock's ticking. 

Or I could strong-arm my way through and blast one person--whom I'm pretty sure only has one gas can--with multiple blood cards. But then I'm outed, too, and people will be gunning for me (literally). I didn't draw a single weapon or bullet in this game, so again, I'm screwed. 

[b]I played it coy.[/b] I had at least two trades--and possibly three or four; I can't remember exactly--where I gave people nice, safe items. I finally made my move, and Stalker came really, [i]really[/i], REALLY close to giving me a gas can. Again, if he'd done that, I was screwed. Yes, he didn't, and yes, it was the start of the end for the humans.

But that's where it falls apart for me. The game was [i]that[/i] close to blowing up again, even though I'd been biding my time. The game's just too short for you to play the Long Con. So you have to play the Medium Con, and there's a darn good chance it'll blow up in your face. 

There was fun paranoia. There was an exquisite moment where Kevin suspected I'd infected Stalker and he tried to talk Luke into running a scan. Had Luke done that, it would have been obvious that it was indeed Stalker and me. But Luke didn't. The scan happened one (or two) turns later, and by that time there'd been one more trade (I think), and that was enough uncertainty that people couldn't be sure who the two infected were now. That was a tense and wonderful series of events. 

But at that length, I don't like that we're going to have either a great, fun, paranoid romp, or a broken, aborted, frustrating slog--and to have that decided by one person's small, unknowing choice...

The first time we cracked this out my friends and I (total of 5 players) played 6 rounds straight, and killed pretty much an entire Sunday. The length of time per round and the fact that they almost never played out in a similar fashion made each round feel fresh.

The amount of suspection and distrust that forms after a few trades and couple of accusations is quite suprising. Even using a key item like the heat scanner and calling someone out still raises suspesion around both parties as it could be a deception by the host.

While many have said that it is easy to break the game by everyone agreeing not to trade, we simply do not do this, as yes... it would break the game. We also play with an in house room that keeping your characters in the reactor (safe) room for more than 1 turn causes you to lose 1 health per additional turn.

In a 4 player game, we usually take out a gas can, or put fewer gas into the starting cards in order to make things more interesting. We have introduced many friends to this game, even those that do not play board games, and it has never received anything but praise.

My kind of game....
Under the old rules I would've rated it less due to a poorly made rulebook, but now it earns the full ten from me.
"Bullets for Infection?"

NEW EDIT: Sometimes the rules get a little bogged down with people who over think this game (planning out their every move for about 10 minutes each round). But the game is mostly about the suspense and laughs.

Fragile! 

what you need:For first play - the latest rules (2.2), player aides (a must!) and a good rules explainer.
for all the plays - no laughing (seriously) and a willingness to play a couple of games in a row. 

What the game offers is a neat narrative and atmosphere in a very short time. What it isn't however (not all people agree with me on this) is a game with traitor mechanics like Werewolf or Resistance. This is more about a story than the struggle between two groups. If you have a group willing to roll with it, it's neat. 

Also: I like to solo it. :blush: It has enough narrative that it works for me. 

Edit: needs the right group. The atmospehere is provided by the game and quite strongly so. The game has many problems, but if you get the right group it delivers a strong narrative and drama.

Played this one three times at BGG Con 2011. What an interesting card game with a flavorful traitor mechanic. I personally love this game but you ABSOLUTELY have to have a group that is willing to interact.

If your group normally looks down at their game pieces and says very little during a game then this is NOT for you.  This game will be enjoyable or miserable depending upon the group that you play with.

[1 play] For me, since I love the movie "The Thing", the theme of this game and the paranoia instilled by the infection is delicious. I really enjoyed the psychology involved in our first play of this. I have doubts that it has great replayability, however. In its favor, I do think it would play extremely quickly once everyone has the rules nailed down.

Nice artwork. Use a tablecloth for the map cards.

Card, Betrayal/Hidden Role, Adventure. Provisional rating after one play at BGGcon. It's not a complicated system, but I'm not sure we're playing it right. We heard that the v2.2 rules changed/corrected a lot of stuff in the first English printing. As it stands, it seems (a) nigh impossible for the humans to win, and (b) the infection tracking system breaks at least piece of equipment.

One of the problems for me is that even if I "know" you are infected, there is no way for me to stop you from coming to get me because I can't act out of turn. Assuming I had ammo, I could shoot you 4 times and kill you in 1 turn if we're in the same room, but by then you've already infected me.

I'd like to play again with the current, correct rules and see how it goes.

[2011-10-29]
Az egyik felkapott 2011-es esseni játék volt a Panic Station, nagyon nagy lelkesedéssel ültem le hozzá játszani és talán a legnagyobb társasjátékos csalódás volt az eddigi "pályafutásom" során.
A játék kerettörténetét is sokkal hosszabban részletesen is le lehetett volna írni, ehelyett csak pár mondatból tudjuk meg, hogy egy alakulat tagjai vagyunk, akik információt szereztek egy gonosz parazita létformáról, amit el kell pusztítani egy földalatti állomáson. A játékosok egyenként két karaktert irányítanak, egy embert és egy robotot (4-4 életponttal és 2-2 akcióponttal). Az ember tudja csak megnyeri a játékot, ha három kanna benzint szétlocsolva felgyújtja a parazita fészkét. Az androidnak van csak fegyvere kezdetben és a játék végéig is csak ő használhat lőfegyvert. A két karakter játék folyamán szerzett tárgyai viszont olyanok, mintha mindkettejüknél lennének egyszerre. A játékosok szobákat tudnak felfedezni, ezzel növelve az állomás nagyságát és egyre közelebb jutni a fészekhez, kutatni tudnak egy szobában, amivel tárgyakhoz jutnak, illetve mozogni és tárgyakat használni tudnak a kezdetben 4 akciópontjukkal, amit tetszés szerint oszthatnak el a két karakterük között. Tárgyak szerzése közben kerülhet olyan kártya hozzánk, ami kijelöli, hogy gazdatestek leszünk és kezdhetjük terjeszteni a vírust a többi ember között. Három víruskártyával kezd mindenki a saját színében, amit átadva egy másik egészséges játékosnak - a kötelező találkozásokkor végrehajtandó csere folyamán - fertőzi meg, ha az nem benzinkannát ad cserébe. Ez a dolog öli meg alapjaiban a játékot sajnos. Ugyanis a hőszkennelésen kívül is elég jól kideríthető a sok cserét kieszközölő játékosról, hogy ki a vírushordozó vagy fertőzött így vele kerülni kell a cserét, de ez elkerülhetetlen főleg, ha egyre nő a fertőzöttek száma. A cserekor muszáj benzinkannát adnunk, ha nem akarunk megfertőződni, de ezzel csökken az esélyünk a végső cél elérésére. A benzinkannák száma elég kicsi és ha ezeket begyűjtik a csere folyamán a fertőzöttek, akkor az egészséges játékosok nem győzhetnek. Pontosabban győzhetnek, ugyanis a fertőzöttek is győznek, ha meghal minden ember vagy mindenki fertőzött lesz. Így az se világos, hogy kell korrekten játszani, ha látjuk fertőzöttként könnyebb nyerési lehetőségünk van. Fertőzöttként pedig annyi a dolgunk, hogy egyfolytában kutassunk, amivel megszerezhetjük a tárgypakli minden benzinkannáját és már el is értük a célunk. 4 akcióponttal és csoportos kereséssel egy körben 4*2=8 lapot tudunk megszerezni a kevés lapból álló tárgypakliból. Szinte lehetetlen az egészségesek céljának elérése, kevés játékos esetén főleg.
A szabály, sajnos nem jól felépített másrészt hiányos és nem egyértelmű. Már a harmadik FAQ-ot adják ki hozzá, pedig nemrég jelent meg a játék. A kivitelezéstől sem ájul el az ember, mert komor szobalapok még elmennek, de a tárgyak képeihez nem igazán alkottak egyedi kinézetet. Jó nagy csalódás a Panic Station. Jót nehéz találni benne. Kettest érdemelne, de azért adok hármast, mert úgy tudom már új játékmenetet is kitaláltak hozzá, ami lehet lényegében javítja a játék alapvető hibáját.

It doesn't work mechanically or thematically. While many think it works experientially, don't bother with it unless you just must have novelty. There are far better games with traitor mechanics out there and you will get as much or more suspense out of any of them.

RATING: 7
An interesting cooperative with a really cool traitor mechanic. I can't believe that this game hasn't been made yet, with an alien assimilating people that are trying to defeat the source of the infestation. The tension naturally lies in trying to work together to get the hive cleansed while worrying about who has become infected. The printed rules are totally bogus in the initial version, but the latest rules on the Geek should make for an entertaining game. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I want to love this game, but I just can't ignore the problems. Incentives to win don't necessarily align with the theme, which means allowing yourself to be infected can be a winning strategy. That's bad. What's more, many of the rules make no sense. They feel [i]ad hoc[/i], meant solely to balance the game. For a thematic game, that's a problem. Also, on my second play, the infected player quit in disgust; his options disappeared once we began to attack him early on. He might've avoided this with better play, but Battlestar Galactica handles this problem better by giving traitors something to do even after they've been outed. Unlike BSG, this game feels untested and unfinished, too dependent on the players.

This is one of the best multiplayer games I've played. There's lots of mind games involved. Is she infected? Why is she acting so suspiciously?

It gets better with time - players get better at deception. Mind games on top of mind games.

What separates it from games like the Resistance is if you don't feel like overthinking things, there are guns and grenades, so you can just blow stuff up! This makes it a blast to play no matter what mood you're in.

This just did not work for our group. We might not have played it completely correctly, and I still love the art of the floor tiles, but most people seemed more puzzled than intrigued and the traiter mechanism got busted super early, leaving us to slog through the rest of the game. 

I really wanted this to work, but somehow it didn't. 
Math-traded it, but am still interested in the concept.

A cute hybrid of Pandemic, Space Hulk and The Resistance.

My rating is as it is because the design [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/730104/cant-touch-this-a-broken-4-players-game]encourages a degenerate strategy[/url] -- the host generally can't do much without revealing themselves, which is not the correct outcome of a "hidden traitor" game. Playing in a "fun" way requires playing suboptimally, which to me means that the game is simply broken.

The current rules are a huge improvement over those shipped with the game, however, so maybe by the time it gets to version 17 (at the current rate of change, that will be next week) these issues will be ironed out. I don't like the genre enough to give it another chance.

With the right group and a house rule or two, Panic Station could make for quite the enjoyable experience (but certainly will fall flat for more groups than it sings for). If you have any interest in this game and can find it for under $10, I'd pull the trigger. However, if you need to spend more than that to acquire it, there are a handful of other hidden role games that are more deserving of your money and have a better chance of making it into your regular rotation.

I really don't understand what all the complaints are.

We played this, managed through the rules and all had a great time playing the game.

Lots of deception, lots of paranoia. What more do people want? I like this. A lot.

Update: we've had great games of this and we've had games where it fell a little flat and not a lot happened. It is fast enough that I can basically overlook it, but because of it (and other reasons) I'd always choose The Resistance over this.

Further update: From memory, I think that 50% of the plays have been good or excellent and the other half have fallen flat. That isn't a high enough hit rate for me. That, and the game really doesn't function with 4 players.

Rating down from 7.1 to 5.

It reminds me of a mixture of Battlestar Galactica and Space Hulk, only just half the characters can fight (IF they have ammo, and that's a big if) and the only way to defend against the traitors is to give them resources that are at the same time your only win condition. 
The Infected are pretty overpowered and there is almost no reason not to just join them as soon as possible.

Not to mention players can be excluded from the game very quickly, or - even worse - made completely impotent, still on the board but unable to do anything:
If you're wounded you only have one action. Either move OR fight. IF your character even CAN fight in the first place. Good luck catching someone that runs from you.

RATING: 7.5
I'm basing this review on one play, mind you it was with experienced players.  Still the few times we had to refer to the rules were very painful.  I can't  even fathom learning this game blind.  At it's heart it's a great little traitor game that borrows quite a bit from other titles but has some unique twists.  It plays a little like BSG but without the huge time investment (which is a win).  It seems challenging to win as the uninfected, having to issue that trust to others around the table, likely plays better with a full group (we played with 4).  After I was infected I really got into enjoying the game and sewing the paranoia until it was time to get stabby on a droid.  The theme is great invoking the feel of "The Thing" and the components aren't bad either.  I do feel that they should be using "Infested" rather then "Infected" but at the end of the day compared to everything else wrong with the terrible rules, thats a pretty minor detail.  Cards could have some text or detail included, but I'm thankful they don't for obvious reasons related to the rules.

My first game of panic station had 6 players, and was taught by someone who was in turn taught the game from Essen. We played a set of rules printed out from BGG, not the original rules. They were probably 2.2.

The first game we aborted because someone accidentally passed the initial virus card instead of one of his infection cards. We restarted the game.

In the second game, the person that was infected initially passed non-infection cards, but the first time he did pass an infection he was caught by someone passing a gas canister and accused. He didn't do a very good job of denying it.

We were playing with the Essen promo of the antidote, which was a mistake in hindsight. The antidote was passed to the person infected. The rest of the game was just a slog to find the hive with no tension.

Overall I thought the game was OK. I'll gladly play it again which may improve my rating. For this to happen though I need some more tension and paranoia. You really need the person infected to be very smart about trading away his infection. If he gets caught by a gas canister the first time he tries, it seems very tricky for him to win.

Update after another play: Panic station has the potential for a great game but after 2 out of 2 duds, I'd rather play the consistently great Battlestar Galactica.

Sadly, I just hated this game.  Which is very disappointing, because I was really looking forward to an insidious paranoia-filled infection game that would keep everyone guessing until the very end.  The mechanics available here just do not support the awesome theme.

Confusing to first-time players, broken out of the box (the game can conclude without any players becoming infected, it's easier to win if you switch to the infected side), it makes no logical sense sometimes (explore one room & open up a new room on the opposite side of the station, trade gas cans to stop infection?, 5-card hand "minimum"), and punishingly difficult to lie when you become infected (everyone watches your face as you trade).  During our 6-player game, we all knew which two players were infected and because of how the cards came out, there was nothing we could do to win as humans.  The Hive was 5 spaces away from the Reactor room, game over.  And i still can't figure out why exactly I have an Android following me around.

I can see some players liking this game, but only if you play "in the spirit of the game" and "for the fun of it" because when you start gaming this system it falls apart quickly.  Apologies to Stronghold Games since I love the game "Confusion" but this is my least favorite game of 2011.

UPDATE:  Taught me a valuable lesson as a designer which I have carried over into 2012 as my own game hit the shelves.  Opinions are simply opinions.

This is a very cool game, I wish there were a deluxe edition with higher quality components (namely cardboard tiles instead of playing cards) along the lines of Ausloos' other games Dark Darker Darkest and Rogue Agent.

I still didn't get this one: it is easier to just give in and became infected as soon as possible. Better sooner than later. I guess the game could use something like a sleeper phase (that is part of the [b]Battlestar Galactica[/b]). I believe a set number of infected could be more of a use than the mechanic of infect others.

Because any action other than go into a completely different direction than the others, is a strong indicative of a infected person. Sure, maybe the map won't allow someone to move further away. Then he should wait. Just wait until the others gather some distance, then he can move again anywere else.

I don't know. I played 3 times and I still don't get what makes the humans carry flamethrowers and aren't able to use them to burn down parasites - sure, it would use a gas can, but it beats taking enough damage to die. Or why only the droids can use weapons and became infected. The droids should be able to brawl with their enhance strenght and limbs to fight the parasites with bare hands. The humans should use the weapons.

A theme driven game [u]must[/u] make sense. If they make sense, even if the mechanics are somewhat clumsy, it didn't matter all that much. I like [b]Arkham Horror[/b] more than a person should like a game, but I know that it has some mechanics that make the gameplay fiddly, but they make sense in the setting. I can say: "You can't trade and Ally. Why? He is [u]your[/u] friend, not his/hers. And the Clues? Well, you don't know if they are true, so you don't share more than the minimum."

Anyway, I can make a sense of it. In Panic Station many things I can't, so when I explain the game I don't have the sureness to pass the theme to the players.

"Why humans can't use weapons?"

... They... don't have... hands?

"Why shouldn't I became infected?"

... Uh... the... bite really hurts?

"How can a droid became infected?"

... Hã... No... antivirus?

These and other bits make this one a game that could be something more, but just can't get there.

This game is very dependant upon those playing it, how well the rules are explained, and a need to get into the spirit of the game and ignore all the mechanics that don't make "thematic sense".  Get past that and this is a game that will give you tales to tell of lucky escapes, desperate searches for ammo and fuel, and how your friends betrayed you.

A really fun concept, with some very interesting things to say about the hidden-agenda genre. Sadly however, both plays were marred by the rulebook. It was very poorly written and (as far as we could tell) also kind of broken. Going in knowing that there are clarifications would at least get around that hiccup though, so hopefully you won't have the same experience that we did.

Been playing this several times a year for almost 5 years. Despite some ambiguities in the rules (corner-case stuff mostly), it is my favorite hidden-identity game. Took a while to learn how to teach it effectively to new players, but now can do it reliably in 20 minutes.

Because the traitor has the ability to create more traitors, even when you're "it" you aren't stuck playing alone. The fact that no one knows when new traitors are created leads to great post-game rundowns of exactly what was going on and who knew what when.

Gameplay is simple enough to be easy to teach, options are usually broad enough that you have control of your fate, and extremely bad luck can still be turned around if you end up switching teams.

This game has consistently created good stories for me, and I always enjoy teaching it to new players, or playing with friends that know it.

The game as described by the designer and the psychology of game theory as applies to the situation are completely at odds. If you want to win, you want to become infected. The more other people realize this, the more likely it is the infected will win. It becomes a race to get infected. Also, the mechanics make no thematic sense whatsoever. It seems like a thought experiment that got about 90% of the way before realizing it didn't work, but it was too late to turn back.

Hard to explain (requires big dose of creativity to make each mechanics seems logical) but fun to play - very rich and deep gameplay, two our groups like it a lot. Playing with 4 has it's flaws, playing with 5-6 is very good.

Some tips for explaining:

Troopers - scientists;
Bioandroids -mentally connected with scientist, they can be infected because the're BIOandroids and then mental connection starts working for parasites;
this station - just last point in the dangerous journey of the heroes to save humanity, that's why they may have no bullets and weapon - they spend all this before;
Some time before scientists find out that parasites afraid of the gasoline;
Tranding gas for defending from infection symbolises spending gasoline to protect yourself (spending, because parasite player will not give it back to anyone) .
If you trade gas with non-infected player - just some good exchange between two friends :)
etc.

I hope it will help to somebody.

First up let me say I was looking forward to the buzz about this game at Essen 2011, it sounded great, and secondly some of our group taught Panic Station at Stronghold over the weekend so we were alright with the rules.

Then I played it. I rated PS at 1 for the 'You wont catch me dead playing this' part of the rating and for the fact this may have been the single least enjoyable gaming experience I have ever had. 1 hour+ of circular arguing, no tension and very little game. Too much pointless stuff happening to be fun and quick like Resistance, not enough game to be interesting like BSG.

This game is not broken, I repeat not broken! You just need to immerse deep into the game. If you think that the human can easily change side into infected in order to get onto the winning side, then you're not immersing the game. It's like real life, when a human in that kind of situation, hell you're better dead than get infected. So. do your best not to get infected.

I like the game, the paranoia and terror it delivers are awesome. And this game can really shine based on the group. Though the rules are a bit overwhelming.

The core concept is interesting, but the implementation left me a bit unconvinced. Wouldn't mind playing again to reassess, but I get the feeling that there is (or at least should be) a game that does the same thing but more to my taste, i.e. without the gratuitous dungeon crawl mechanic and other chrome which really aren't my cup of tea. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Easily among my least favorite game I've ever played. The mechanics are a joke. The art and components are average at very best. No way to track whether you have been infected. You can't really ask questions because with a hidden agenda, any question may reveal your true identity. And every single time someone gets infected, its almost guaranteed (or at least highly likely) they will react in some way revealing not only the person being infect but also the person doing the infecting. This is a HUGE deal in a bluffing style game. And most social deduction/bluffing games are very light which minimizes the need for questions during play. That is not the case with this game as it have so many fiddly rules. I would be happy to never play this game again.

Panic Station is a paranoia-driven partly cooperative game in which you control two characters in the Extermination Corps sent out by the government to investigate the presence of fiendish alien life forms.
\13\\13\
Players need to move both their Androids and Troopers through the base, exploring and gathering equipment that will help them to complete their mission: to find and destroy the Parasite Hive hidden somewhere in the inner depths of this hell. When a player manages to get his Trooper into the Hive location and play three gas can cards to fuel his Flamethrower, he wins the game for the humans.
\13\\13\
However, one of the players is a Host. He must keep this identity secret, infecting as many team members as possible to gain allies and prevent the humans from completing their mission. Only players who carefully watch the behavior of team members and find a good balance between cooperation and paranoia will stand a chance against the infected players and roaming parasites.
\13\\13\
The game uses a unique exponential traitor-system and combines tactical play with a compelling psychological mindgame amongst players.
\13\\13\
Panic Station is a game of growing paranoia in which no one can truly trust anyone. Can you maintain your sanity and destroy the source of this evil?

This game is hard to rate. It strikes me as the type of game that will be a little clunky 9 times out of 10, but that 10th time will be something you'll all talk about for years.

Ultimately, I think it asks too much of the players. I'm OK with a few "you can't do that or the game will break" things in a design (e.g., taking credit for individual cards in Battlestar Galactica), but this game has too many of those: don't play assuming you'll be the one infected and try to have everyone win that way; don't trade gas can for gas can in an organized way; I'm thinking even "make sure you search frequently" might be one, as in our game hand sizes maintained pretty consistently small (for about half the game I couldn't even play a card since every time I drew one it was a parasite and I couldn't go below the hand minimum) and therefore everyone mostly just had one gas can and one not gas can, so the gas cans moved around pretty regularly.

I'd be more willing to play this again than most games I rate a 6, but only with the right group.

What is most disappointing about Panic Station is its great potential. There is something in proximity to a brilliant game here but it's buried beneath a mess of loose mechanisms & mathematical predictability/determination. The ideas & encouraged behaviours in this are brilliant, but they just don't execute well at all. As Vlaada Chvatil said to Ignacy Trzewiczek early in the design process of Robinson, "You don't have control of your game..." & this is what happens when you don't have Vlaada test for you.

I could see this one as an 8-9 rated game EASILY if (IF) the rules get sorted out a bit better. The flow of the game is confusing as it is anyway without the loose rulebook.

Having said that - usually rules inconsistencies and and unclear rulebook put games into the "6 and lower" rating territory. This game is fun and immersive enough to warrant a greater than 7 just on theme and gameplay alone. Really interesting traitor mechanic game.


I dig it.

RATING: 5.8
BEWARE: all the comment based on a single experience with a horrible explanation at Essen 2011. The rate is 5.5 but i write 5.8 just not to ruin avarages based on a bad experience.

Good thing about this game is the atmosphere of suspect it creates after u understand the game. art is a bit too dark and symbols do not help very much in understanding the meaning of the cards.
the mechanism of infection could be a clever one but it came out as a complete mess and total confusion. it is too easy to cheat or simply to make some mistake during the check phase. i find the mechanism of gas quite absurd and not working properly. maybe it was just the wrong explanation

RATING: 2.5
Rating accordinig to the BGG rating guidelines: Likely won't play this, but could be convicted. The designer told me [geekurl=/geeklist/142398/item/2152784?commentid=2961558#comment2961558]here[/geekurl] that this game isn't for me:

"This is above all a metagame experience"
"The game is very open-ended in structure, meaning that it takes a few plays at least to grasp what is possible"
"The V1.1 rules were admittingly a disaster area"
"It is crucial that all players know the system well before starting a first session."
" This is a game that has players forming strategies over several games, rather than within one game"
"the game is not imbalanced. It is VERY group-depending."
"It works best with players who know each other and are not afraid to accuse other players, lie, mainpulate"

in a sum: needs a fix group to play with; not suited for play in my gaming club where each play would include several new players

The infection mechanism is hugely clever, which is why it's so painful that Panic Station crashes and burns more often than it succeeds.  If the game isn't played exactly in the intended spirit - by each and every player - it simply doesn't work.

On the publishing side, not including player aids was a colossal act of dumbness.  Nothing ruins the game more quickly than players needing to consult the rulebook after every trade to see what a new item does, as the simple act of reading lets everyone know that the received card wasn't an infection card.

And how do you respond when a player reveals in the first round that "Our friend Joe just passed me an infection card. Everyone avoid him."  Uh, thanks?  Next game, please?

All of which is a real shame, because casual to medium-casual gamers - who I thought would be the target audience - don't have the patience for dealing with Panic's full-geek level of complexity.  So what could have been a power hit is instead a niche experience for John Carpenter fans.

If the game becomes part of your group's regular gaming beat, and not too many new players join up, I could see this going somewhere.  If not, do your best to enjoy the ride.

[i]Update:[/i]

I keep hoping that Panic Station will receive a better reception with different players, but that never happens.  Everyone ends up hating it.  Always.

It's an experience that's far too fragile.  The first few rounds need to go perfectly for the game to be properly balanced, atmospheric, and fun - but that requirement is rarely met.  Panic Station never hits the perfect lift-off, which immediately kills it dead. Another year of testing and development was sorely needed, but never pursued.

House rules might work wonders, but no one thinks it's worth the time.  Minimally, disallowing table talk for the first 1-3 rounds seems reasonable.

From session to session, the game can be a solid 7, but the odds are greater that it winds up being a 3 or 2. Weighted averages being what they are, a 4 rating is where the dust settles.

I really like the concept of this game, and I'm looking forward to playing it enough with the same group to get past any "first play" hiccups with the rules and strategy.

The original printed rules did have some issue [i](mostly minor things that were blown way out of proportion in the forums)[/i], but the designer has done an excellent job dealing with that and the updated rulebook (v2.2 - in the files section) is a big improvement.


If you're the kind of person that always needs to solve games and will over-analyze them to death, or if you're the kind of person that cares more about "winning" than actually playing and enjoying a game, you'll want to look elsewhere.    Fun-suckers like you will not enjoy this game, and all you'll really do is ruin it for others.

After a lengthy rules explanation, I expected a lot more meat from this game. It ran very short, maybe 25-30 minutes with very little infection for us. I think we were all expecting something a bit longer so the host wasn't aggressive. I think I'd need a couple more plays for a more fair review.

Although I liked the game that I played of this, I expect that a lot more games flop than finish well. The first infection success or failure plays a huge role in whether humans or the infected win. If that infection is a dud, the root player is pretty much screwed. We also never found that the parasites did anything. They just hung out and pretended to be dangerous.

The paranoia induced by this game is great, though. If you like Werewolf style hidden evils, you should try this game at least.

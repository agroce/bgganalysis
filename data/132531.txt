There is something of a 'choose your own adventure' feel to this game and the strategies develop quickly during a short time frame. Some psychological strategy and careful observance can be a path to victory when all else fails. And cool dice, too!

Another game that is STRICTLY WORSE as a boardgame as opposed to being a PC game.

+ Yay dice. 

- We secretly roll dice and secretly assign them, behind a screen. What?! This is the greatest invitation to cheating i have ever seen in any game. 
"Don't play with cheaters."
Don't design games to have glaring holes that can be exploited at any moment by anyone without any consequences.

- Zero interaction. Literally. Zero. Interaction. The game has four hundred components and they manage to put ZERO interaction in. Invade others' planets. Work together on some developments. Trade goods. Kill their workforce, fight with ships, bribe, bluff, negotiate... Nope. None of it. The game BEGS to be interactive and they manage to destroy all traces of life in it. Shut up, sit down, stare at your part of the game, collect points, go home. 
Singleplayer multiplayer boardgames are the worst.

- There's no reason to play this live. You gain NOTHING from playing live that you couldn't gain online. That's a mark of a miserable game. It is only more fiddly, clunky, chaotic, slow. 

- A bunch of rules that flavorfully make no sense. The kind you put in to make the game flow exactly as planned, with no regard to flavor. Another classic example of good game design.

2.5/10
Enjoy your spot in the top 100, Roll. You're everything that most BGG raters want.

Kinda hard to get into in the first game, but after two games, we looked at each other, and declared our love to the game.

Will bring it for our vacation, and hope to get many, many games under our belt there.

It's hard to give a review after just two games, especially with a game like this, but you could just feel there is something to it. We kept starving us selves from resources, but once our little machine started going, it was just so satisfying. Highly recommended.

I suspect that this will, over time, grow on me in much the same way that Race for the Galaxy did. I like the mechanism where you add more options through specialized dice over the course of the game. Quite clever. There's a real game in here, certainly.

Apesar de o jogo ser "maior" do que seu irmão mais velho Race For The Galaxy (caixa maior, mais componentes, mais jogadores) ele continua trazendo as mesmas sensações. Seria um jogo irrepreensível e com mecânicas bem integradas se não fosse o furo de design que faz você TER que confiar no que acontece atrás do escudo do adversário. Isso é MUITO estranho.

I dislike Race for the Galaxy and will always play San Juan instead which I enjoy very much. All of the small icons on the player cards I find annoying. In contrast I really like this game and to me it very much feels like a race. Curiously I've only ever played it 2 player (8 games so far) and I think it works very well with this number. Here's hoping for some expansions! In short, highly recommended!

It's a good game, and I'm enjoying playing it a lot, but some of the design choices are clunky: It is unintuitive to place dice results onto phase spaces where the symbols don't match (also to do the same thing when re-assigning dice); the hidden turns behind the screens are an odd feature - totally understand why they are there - but in a game with so much unintuitive stuff going on, this opens up a lot of scope for mistakes by new players going un-noticed; the gameplay is totally uninteractive.

That said, I love simultaneous play, and RFTG scores big on that point. The engine-building is very satisfying, the game length is just right, and the game seems well balanced. I like the aesthetics too.

My favourite genre is dice-rolling, and I have many such games, but this game doesn't feel like a dice game in any real sense. It has MANY dice included, but the rolling of the dice is of minimal importance in the overall gameplay (because dice can be placed on non-matching spaces etc.). There are few opportunities to re-roll dice, combine dice, add up results, push-your-luck: all staples of the dice genre. I have chosen to think of this as an engine-building game to sit alongside San Juan and others of that ilk. As a dice game it disappoints.

That all said, overall, it's a pretty nice package.

RATING: 6
3 plays / 2,5 players

LIKE: Rolling dice and finding combos can be fun and interesting.
DISLIKE: it's difficult to know the combos and what to look for the first time playing. Minimal player interaction. Small text on the planets are a negative for me. You really need to know the tiles well.

OVERALL: The dice make the game. I liked it, but low player interaction keeps it from being a great game. This game becomes an efficiency race, which has been done to many times over.

I am not a fan of Race for the Galaxy and this one only fares slightly better for me. I love the space spanning theme. I don't love the esoteric combinations. And I really dislike the roll behind the screen. With certain players, I doubt honesty. With others, it is easy to make a mistake. And it feels like a clunky way to assure variety to decisions. So not for me really.

RATING: 4
I am genuinely amazed. A dice game that is actually harder to teach and more complicated than the original game. And still, Roll for the Galaxy manages to be shallower and a less satisfying experience. 

RollftG does not offer the same agonizing trade-offs as its mother because you are not closing doors when paying for the cards in your hand. The only good thing left in RollftG is the action selection and leeching, which is now twice as complicated as before. Usually you would expect complex games to have a lot of depth, since you are balancing between many things, but not in RollftG. You just have a number of choices with a myriad of restrictions but none of them seemed very interesting.

Due to the unnecessary and non-rewarding complexity and the lack of trade-offs, I most likely won't play this again.

RATING: 8.5
Fantastic game!  I wouldn't go so far as to call it a Race for the Galaxy killer, but my gaming group likes Roll better than Race because of Race's difficult iconography.

Roll is fast and fun with lots of strategy.  I prefer games like Roll with input randomness (i.e. the random element happens and then you make decisions on that out, rather than having a random element determine the outcome of your decisions), and the random factor in Roll makes for challenging decision making while also being something you can affect by choosing which dice you add to your civilization.

I was never able to work up enough interest to learn Race for the Galaxy. The complex iconography just never clicked for me and the game felt overly complicated and not worth the pay off. Roll has become a fantastic alternative that lets me quickly learn and experience (an admittedly less intricate) race for the Galaxy at a mechanically more approachable level. I really enjoy this version and probably will never bother with the card game version now. The game sets up, plays, and teaches very efficiently and I just have a lot more fun playing it than the card game.

+ Tactical Decisions
You are constantly figuring out how to use your resources as efficiently as possible. It may feel like you are at the mercy of luck when you are rolling dice or drawing tiles, but there is almost always a way to turn things in your favor. Every round is a challenging puzzle that is rewarding to solve.  

+ Reading Other Players
An important part of the game is being able to anticipate what other players will do so that you can take advantage of their phase selection. It is especially gratifying when you are able to pull this off. 

+ Satisfying Engine Building
Building your empire by gaining dice from settlements and acquiring special abilities from developments is fun. There is always something to look forward to.

- Multiplayer Solitaire
Because most of the game takes place behind the player screens, it is easy to focus on your own tableau and ignore the rest of the table. Even if you are paying attention, it is hard to keep track of what everyone is doing and what their special abilities are. This is probably something that will get better with more plays and familiarity with the game.

RATING: 6
The best thing is that this can be an intro to the card game.  Adding text to the tiles is a godsend but the hieroglyphics are still there and allocating dice makes the game much, much longer than Race.  I like it more if the game was under 30 minutes.

Being a big fan of tableau building games, I quite enjoy Roll for the Galaxy. I've been looking for a cool heavier dice game for quite some time and so far this is the best one I've played!

As far as visual impact is concerned, while I really like the artwork in this game, I wish that the graphic design could be a little bit clearer and less gray. As it is, it's functional but not quite so eye-catchy and still too busy at times. I have a mixed impression of the component quality as well. On the one hand I absolutely love the dice! They're good quality, have bright colors and a well thought-out iconography. I also like the thickness of the tile, but - on the other hand - I unfortunately cannot say the same about the player boards, which are too thin for my taste. 

Mechanism-wise instead build combos and cool interactions is one of my favorite things in games and Roll for the Galaxy offers this in spades! There's just so many ways to personalize your game, as you develop new technology and settle new planets, and there's also an excellent replay value in the base box already. Yet I also find myself enjoying a lot the element of dice manipulation that this title offers. Ever since the Voyages of Marco Polo I've been very intrigued by this kind of mechanism and Roll for the Galaxy makes no exception. 

Unfortunately though I do have a few minor dislike about the game. For one thing there's not really much interaction between the players besides enabling the actions and therefore the whole game can feel really solitaire, especially with 4 or 5 players. Also there's a considerable amount of luck, in particular concerning the drawing of the tiles. Depending on your strategy and the various synergies that you have built in front of you, you might need to draw a certain type of tile and yet lose a great deal of explore actions trying to find something useful. There're ways around this problem, but it's still hard to control, ironically much more so than the dice.

For these reasons my enjoyment of the game isn't as high as it could have been. Still I quite enjoy Roll for the Galaxy, especially at lower player counts. A solid game that I'll play gladly from time to time.

1st play: Wow, when I started hearing this game was good, I thought there was no way it could live up to the hype. After enjoying the Alien Orb expansion cards, and hating the orb, I was weary of this new twist to one of my old favorites. This game delivers, and might actually be a slight improvement over the original at higher player counts. I can't remember the last time my game-group buddies and I played a new game twice in one night(Aside from 15 minute social deduction games), but this one we did.

2nd play: Still excellent, the decisions to make each round are fun, the dice push you in one way or another, but you can still control your fate. I'm looking forward to the inevitable expansion at some point, but the game doesn't need it. This is an improvement over race in some ways, but not so much that it replaces it. Solid entry in the "for the galaxy" trilogy.

Great game, Tom Lehmann was able to create a completely different game using the same feeling of Race for the Galaxy. Don't think this is an easy game because it's a Dice Game, it is very though and interesting, very interesting design. I'm a huge fan of Race for the Galaxy and this one is very good, too.

Nice twist on a deck builder by swapping cards for dice.  Plays quick but still offers lots of tough decisions.  I like the mechanic of selecting which action you want to play after the dice are rolled while opponents do the same and only selected action dice are retained while the rest are sent back to the cup which adds a fun element of 'game theory'.

RATING: 7
I'm not a fan of dice rolling. When a well executed plan fails because of a dice roll, it just frustrates me - even if it happens to someone else resulting in my favor. However, in RollFTG, your dice rolls can largely be mitigated in such a way that luck is greatly reduced and can usually still be saved to execute your plan or even lead you down another favorable path.

Being able to bet on how the other player(s) will execute a phase is fun... Even when the plan doesn't work out, it's great to see how everyone was hoping the dice would play out. I also enjoy the multiple avenues to victory, being able to watch what your opponents are doing to gauge out how well off you are and to be able to adjust your plan to get a leg up and get back in the running again. I've been able to adjust my plan every time to accommodate what's on the board and pull out big score runs quickly. Very satisfying! Locked in at 45 minutes regardless of player count is a little bit of a let down. I wish it were just slightly longer, but it doesn't deter me overall. Better to end too soon than to drag too long.

This is a beast for me to wrap my head around and teach. Since everything is pretty much executed at the same time, I find it difficult to explain this game in a logical format. Once the rules are understood though, it's easy to play.

We haven't played this is a while, but I'd always be in for a game.

This is actually one of the better dice games that I've played. But it's still a dice game. People can potentially be shut out due to the dice not giving them any options (NOTE: I was playing with the wrong rule for the longest time, You may assign ANY die to ANY action to activate that action regardless of the die's result.).

There is a fair amount of multiplayer solitaire in Roll. But honestly, the game has actually grown on me over time. I enjoy playing it now more than I enjoyed it several plays ago. So that's a pretty good design.

Race for the Galaxy is a favourite game and inevitably that colours my reaction to Roll...

Roll is a clever implementation of the action selection and tableau building of Race using dice and tiles.  On brief acquaintance, the luck of the dice seems about the same as the luck of the cards; the dice have plenty of wild results and several developments offer the power to re-arrange them. Nonetheless, I prefer the speed and simplicity of choosing an action card over rolling, arranging and re-arranging a bunch of dice.  Ultimately, I don't think that Roll improves on Race, nor does it offer me a significantly different experience.  However, gamers without my baggage may find Roll the more accessible game. 

Production quality is very good.  The dice needed to be small, but the icons on them are clear.  The artwork is good, though less prominent than in Race.

I dread teaching this one, but once everyone gets a couple of rounds under their belt they at least understand the dice mechanic, even if mastery of role selection takes longer. It would be nice to play this a couple of times in quick succession to really cememnt the rules.

Probably a bit tricky for children, due to the confusing role selection mechanic and strategies for engine building.

Το εξαιρετικό Race for the Galaxy σε έκδοση με ζάρια και tiles αντί για κάρτες?? Μμμμ όχι ακριβώς. Το Rollftg πατάει πάνω στους δοκιμασμένος μηχανισμούς του Rtfg αλλά είναι ξεχωριστό παιχνίδι και έχει δικιά του αίσθηση και προσωπικότητα. 

Μια σημαντική αλλαγή είναι η προσθήκη του χρήματος σαν resource στο παιχνίδι. Τα χρήματα καθορίζουν πόσα ζάρια έχεις στην διάθεση σου κάθε γύρα ενώ στο Race οι κάρτες είναι ταυτόχρονα και χρήμα. Αυτό πρακτικά σημαίνει πως ο παίκτης πλέον δεν κοιτάει ένα πλήθος καρτών με διάφορα abilities και δεν χρειάζεται να διαλέγει συνεχώς τι να κρατήσει και τι να πετάξει. Άρα το παιχνίδι είναι σαφώς πιο φιλικό προς τους νέους παίκτες καθώς γλυτώνουν την μεγάλη και συνεχή ροή πληροφοριών που τους δυσκολεύει στο Race. 

Μια άλλη αλλαγή είναι πως πλέον πρώτα γίνεται η παραγωγή των υλικών και μετά η κατανάλωση. Αυτή είναι μια πιο φυσική αλληλουχία των πραγμάτων και πλέον μπορείς να βρεις ένα πλανήτη μέσω exploration, να τον αποικήσεις με settle, να παράγεις και να πουλήσεις την παραγωγή στην ίδια γύρα. 

Για όποιον φοβάται τα ζάρια να πω πως η τύχη παίζει μικρό ρόλο, δεν υπάρχουν κακιές ζαριές. Το παιχνίδι προσφέρει μεγάλη παραμετροποίηση των ζαριών. Απλά να σημειώσω πως δε μου αρέσει που ρίχνουμε τα ζάρια πίσω από την οθόνη μας. Θέλω να υπάρχει διαύγεια.  

Είναι ένα εξαιρετικό παιχνίδι με πολλές επιλογές και αρκετά προσβάσιμο σε νέους παίκτες.

RATING: 7
Initial thoughts after just a few plays: The dice action selection works really well: it's a whole extra layer of tactical decision making every turn. It seems even more important than in Race to guess what other players will do, and it's easy to see from the dice on their build queues and production worlds what they might be up to. On the other hand, it is harder to see what other players' special powers are across the table because they are described in writing. That brings its own big advantage, though, in that there is less of a steep learning curve for newbies as there isn't the same (wonderful) iconography to learn. One generally sees far fewer tiles in this compared to the number of cards you see in Race: I wonder if that means it's harder to find synergies, or whether they are more dependent on the luck of the draw. Just a tentative thought, and I will enjoy finding out as I hope to play this game a lot.

:arrowE: [u]Synopsis[/u]:
I stated in the Puerto Rico entry above that consequent Role Selection games are just not as good. I'd say that's true, with one exception--Roll for the Galaxy.* 

Rather than select a single role on a turn, each player rolls their available dice to represent different phases which will be activated during the round. Multiple phases can be active at the same time, and any reserve dice not allocated to choosing your phase, but which match phases activated by other players, are also consumed and allow for multiple actions each round. Explore tiles, Develop technologies, Settle planets, Produce and Ship goods, and assign dice creatively to manage your economy. 

:arrowE: [u]What I like most[/u]:
Assigning dice! After each player rolls their dice and sees which symbols are available, one (of whatever symbol) is used to select a phase and the rest are placed under their respective phases as potential bonuses. However, every player can set aside a single die to reassign another single die to any phase. On top of that, a number of developments specialize in adding and boosting reassignment power, leading to a TON of "luck" mitigation and very strong control over your economy. Also, those dice are just awesome, and there are so many of them! So many!!!

:arrowE: [u]What I like least[/u]:
While there is a lot of agency available to swap out potential tiles through the Explore phase, there are some games where your available worlds and developments simply don't synergize. You'll still play well, but you're to have to be very crafty to adapt and win by other means.

*[size=7]No, I have not played much Race for the Galaxy, but frankly, I don't care. I so thoroughly enjoy Roll for the Galaxy that I see no reason to attempt to dethrone it. [/size]

RATING: 7.25
A game I am only just beginning to grok and properly enjoy. Suffers from an odd play time: 15 minutes too long to be a filler and 15 minutes too short to feel satisfying on its own. For a game so simply about optimal engine building it also feels bizarrely mechanically dilute to me; the dice are easily made inconsequential, some tiles are OP compared to others, and the guessing your opponent's move introduces risk rather than meaningful interaction, in my opinion. I like to feel the engine in a game throb: the heft of each die in Castles of Burgundy does this for me, whereas Roll is a much looser game with little direct system feedback.

All plays including Ambition expansion.

For start, I'm gonna rate this game a 7.5. It's a good game with some interesting decisions to be made and it has the potential of high replayability. Its rating will go up if I'm not mistaken with the amount of replayability here. Since I'm not coming from RftG, I can't compare between these two games.

Over time, I kept enjoying this game and its clever usage of dice. Even after 20 plays, the game feels fresh (partially affected by expansion starter tiles) and enjoyable for me. No doubt it has become one of my favourites.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Much easier to play than Race for the Galaxy. Absolutely no player interaction which is rather disappointing and the theme is barely there. Unfortunately also suffers from some of Race for the Galaxy's shortcomings when it comes to scoring; if you're far ahead in number of built cards but behind on points, there's zero incentive for you to end the game apart from just getting it over with. Some form of hidden scoring would help mitigate this issue. Neat game that I enjoy playing but my wife isn't so excited by it because of the mentioned issues. Highly random game where it seems to come down to who can manage the randomness better. Sold to make room in our collection for other games.

No danger of replacing Race for the Galaxy with this.  I don't know what it was, but I couldn't find the fun in it for the life of me.  

I appreciate the double-sided tiles increasing the chance I draw what I want, but I couldn't stand constantly spending half my dice just to get the other half of my dice back every turn.  I also never felt like the dice were preventing me from what I wanted to do, making me wonder why I even needed to roll dice in the first place.

In a few words: Would MUCH rather play Race for the Galaxy

I knew coming in that this really wasn't going to be a game for me because of all of the dice rolling and I was proved correct.

Issues:
You want to do an action and you HOPE that the dice roll in your favor.  Sure, you can mitigate it with some "reassign" cards abilities, but there were times where just had no good options to take.  

Dice games in most instances are easier than their board game counter parts.  Knowing all of the rules of Race for the Galaxy can take a while to learn, but once you know the symbology, you know 99% of the cards.  There are a few exceptions (I'm look at you gambling world!) but in whole, they are explainable just with icons on the card.  In Roll, there are a ton of cards text about reassigning and the reassigning phase just takes too long.

I've only played a couple of two-player games so far, but I'm really digging this game. Setup only takes a couple of minutes if you sorted the pieces right in your last tear-down, and everything is so tactile. The tiles for planets/developments feel great, the dice are fun to roll, the plastic dice cups are solid and not flimsy, and you're pretty much always doing something. 

There were a couple of rounds where one of us finished quickly and the other was still placing their dice, so there might be some downtime between quick players waiting.  Some see this as a downside, but I see it as time to either talk to other players or read up on the abilities your planets or developments give you.

My first two games lasted 40 and 20 minutes, with the latter a "rush to end conditions" from one player that ended up being a lot of fun.

My only gripe is the rulebook. As someone who's never played Race for the Galaxy, it took a couple of YouTube tutorials to figure out how to actually play this game. The gameplay itself is pretty simple, but the rulebook was a confusing mess on my first read-through. I'm going to try to find a cheat sheet to help me explain the rules to new players.

First impression: This game is on my list of favorites. I'll update my review after a few more playthroughs if anything changes, but, so far, I'd highly recommend it.

Very quick/satisfying tableau building.  Neat luck mitigation mechanics.

Too little player interaction for me.  Never feel like I have to look at my opponent's tableau.

Also, it seems like the develop/settle strategy is overpowered, (and thus factions/homeworlds that give red dice are also OP.)  Can't say this for sure at only 4 plays so far, but this doesn't change the fact that the metagame is starting to feel stale.

Roll for the Galaxy has some of the best use of dice I have seen in a tabletop game. 

However, for a game driven by dice rolling, the dice are not the most random element.    The Development/Settlement tiles drawn from the bag are where the real luck lies.  Certain tiles are extremely powerful on their own, not even requiring a synergy with the rest of the player's tableau. 

This lack of balance is my biggest problem with the game and for me, this is the reason it does not hold a candle to Race for the Galaxy.

An interesting role-selection, economic snowballing game built of the model of Race of the Galaxy and San Juan. More and more, I've wanted the additional strategies of Race combined with the ease of play of San Juan, and Roll does go in that direction. The developments and worlds in Roll are more like building in San Juan, in having only one ability or granting dice to the player. That ease the requirement for iconography and makes learning easier. The role selection in this game is harsh than in Race: in RftG, it easy to get work around phases that you hoped would be selected but weren't, whereas in Roll, there's no chance to readjust.

My only complaint is that it seems to go by a bit too quick -- it maybe to easy to tableau rush, given you have to build nine worlds/developments instead of 11.

One play. Not sure if this is a game for me. I enjoyed the initial phase where you are deciding what single action to activate, basing your decision on second-guessing what other players may do. But that's about the only time there's any player interaction. Mainly you're not aware of other players at all, they're just moving dice and planet cards around in increasingly random ways as the game goes on, legitimately you have to assume, but you're not really following anyone because the action is simultaneous and even if you did follow them I'm not sure you could do anything to counter their plans, if they have any. Then it's over and time to add up VPs and someone is a winner and I'm not really sure what that was all about.

I LOVE this game.  Roll for the Galaxy is to Race for the Galaxy what one Wes Anderson film is to another.  The two games share an "aesthetic" but are completely enjoyable on their own.

I need some level of engaging player interaction . . . and this beast, as brilliant as it may be, needs something deeper than the surprise behind the selection board to cut the mustard.   I pay less and less attention to what others are doing with every roll.  Eventually deteriorates to the point where I'm not even sure if any of the players are on the same turn. There's just lots of semi-organized rolling, tile grabbing and point salad.   Gets a slight bump for being such a fantastic production. Simply put, it's no Ra: The Dice Game.

Nekem jobban tetszik, mint az rftg. Persze ott elegáns az, hogy minimális kellékkel operál (gyakorlatilag csak kártyák és GYP-jelzők vannak), de nekem ez valahogy több, és nem csak a színesebb kellékek miatt. Itt az akcióválasztás jobban ki van találva, és általánosságban a munkások körforgása is jól működik. Könnyebb mint a nagy elődje, és bár nem rövidebb, azért a kockák pakolgatása ellenére is lement fél óra alatt egy kétszemélyes parti. Szerintem 5-en is tuti lemegy egy órán belül a szimultán végrehajtás miatt. Felmerült a fórumokon, hogy a paraván mögött lehet csalni, de végül is ha valaki hajlamos, minden játékban tud csalni. Szerintem ezen a szinten ez egyszerűen nem jellemző. A kockák egyébként sajnos kisebbek mint amit reméltem, így vigyázni kell rá, hogy ne forduljanak el a tologatás közben.
Elég kiegyensúlyozottnak tűnt két fővel, átlagosan 3-4 pont különbséggel végeztünk. Szinte mindig más módon nyertünk.
A nyelvfüggőség ellenére is sokkal letisztultabbnak éreztem a lapkákat, mint az Rftg többfunkciós lapjait. Itt sokkal kevesebb fajta ikon van egyébként. A garantált 1 pénz jó dolog, de azért így is meg lehet akadni, ha nem gondolkozunk előre.
Az alapkoncepció nagyon hasonló maradt (fázisok, bolygó színek, stb.), mégis sokkal másabb lett mint az előd. Szerintem jól meg fognak férni egymás mellett:) Én szívesebben játszom a kockással, de ma már az Rftg-nek sem vagyok úgy ellene, mint amikor először kipróbáltam.
Összességében megértem a nagy lelkesedést, egyértelműen felnő a régihez (vagy tán túl is nő rajta), de valószínűleg sosem lesz a kedvencem.

I -for one- believe that people liking Race for the Galaxy for its mathy, puzzle-solving nature might totally hate this game. Me on the other hand, being more dice-oriented by nature and not than much into the puzzle-solving 100%, find the game muuuuuuuuch more enjoyable that RaceftG, to the point that I might consider the possibility of not playing RaceftG anymore. So much easier to teach to new players, more easy going while still keeping somewhat the 'ups, i messed up this turn, that is gonna come back and haunt me' sensation, specially since you might reaaally want all your dice to show one particular face and end up having none of them. well, at least it wasn't your fault..or was it?!?

A very nice game, has the feel of race for the galaxy and with some different dice mechanics the result is a bit longer game with very different strategies.

This is by far the best dice version of another game I love.

Everything is quite familiar to RFTG: the turn phases, worlds and developments, production and consuption/trading.
The game is definitely very polished, and quite straightforward (at least for players familiar with Race).

There are many different ways to manipulate dice results, so the luck element is quite manageable: it seems it's far more important  to explore into tiles that work well together (like is drawing comboing cards in Race).

There is just a couple of things keeping me from giving an higher rating:
- while Race is a GREAT 2-player game, Roll seem defintely better with more players.
- Race is the greatest game for a 30 minutes time-slot: once the novelty wears off, will Roll be chosen over Race often enough?

Anyway, I am defintely looking forward to some more plays!

Initial Impression: This game translates the Race for the Galaxy card game into a dice game very well. If you enjoyed the former, chances are that you'll like the latter. Unfortunately for me, I've never been a big fan of the "dice building" genre, so the game leaves me with a "take it or leave it" feeling. I find the dice manipulation aspect of the game a tad too fiddly for my taste. Given the choice I would prefer to play the card game.

The start was a bit hesitating, but after a while the game came clear and after a while, I wanted a second chance. If I wasn't grapped by the game, I would not wanted a second chance. The dice manupilation and choices are very nice and the idea of the actions played and not played are great. This makes the game a bit less strategic, but raise the chances of every player which isn't bad.

Once we got the iconography down, this game played fast and we wanted to start again. There's still more depth to uncover as our scores have increased with each play. The RNG doesn't seem to be in the dice, since the game gives you so much opportunity to control the dice. Instead, the RNG comes down to the tile pull (though you do get a bit of control over that, too, just less than the dice).  

1/14/17: Ambition has been purchased, but not played yet.

4/7/2017: 12-14 total plays. We're ready to incorporate Ambition.

Edit, June 2017: Finally got around to playing Ambition. Did not use the objectives. The new dice are a welcome addition. The added tiles should keep our interest up in the game, too. The game can exhibit some imbalance if someone has luck with tile pulls and starting tiles. When this edge-case arises the game seems to offer little in the way of combating the resulting synergy, as good strategy on behalf of the unlucky player and/or bad strategy on behalf of the lucky player has little effect on the outcome. The latter situation--when the lucky player makes a few strategy mistakes but not enough to impact the outcome--is especially problematic, as it just drags the game out for the losing party and diminishes a bunch of the game's fun. I'm not sure if that can be fixed on the individual game level due to the randomness between the tile pull and the dice rolling. It's something that likely needs to be lived with. Thankfully (?), the edge case has only happened in about 1 of our approx. 20 games. It's a blip on the radar. Had this happened as one of our first games, this may have greatly impacted our opinion of the game.

First impression is a negative one. Rolling dice secretly and assigning them to actions does not make for competitive play as it is too easy to cheat. I feel like the game has been dumbed down, the decision points reduced. Roll feels clunky, Race elegant. No way I would ever choose to play one over the other.

10/16: The dice are an extremely fiddly, uninteresting way to achieve semi-random input for choices. One of the most interesting parts of Race for the Galaxy is looking at what your opponents are doing and trying to predict their action choice. With Roll, your action choice is either easy enough to achieve despite the randomness that there is no point to randomizing in the first place, or it's unpredictable enough that you are essentially playing multiplayer solitaire. Neither of these outcomes is a good argument for using dice. The dual-use tiles are fine. Getting a little more choice is always nice.

No solitary rules makes this a game I can't play.

So why keeping it ? Perhaps I'll wait for a decent solo expansion, but in the meantime it is gathering dust.

Also avoid it when you are a "theme" board gamer. The game is as much about space as my mother is Napoleon.

I don't play games to beat scores and I think that's the problem and why I like these theme based HP Lovecraft games or the Legendary Marvel card games.

Initially I didn't like Roll for the Galaxy, thought it was unbalanced, and gave it a 4 rating.

However, with extra play Ive really come to respect it. It is more balanced than I'd initially thought.

I do find it a bit short; it seems like at's all over while it's still getting started.

Great game. Lots of fun tiles to build your engine. Lots of good decisions to make. My only gripe is that I wish the games lasted a little longer. In my last game I felt like I was just picking up steam when I had to pull off a big combo to take the rest of the VP and end the game for the win.

Very neat engine building game with a clever use of dice. Icons can be a bit intimidating initially but becomes intuitive after awhile. Very minimal player interaction but that's okay, the gameplay more than compensate for it. For a game with dice, there's so many ways to mitigate the luck that it's not a factor at all. It feels like a race with multiple pathway to victory.

I know this game is widely adored. With repeat plays, this will likely rise. For my first play, I just didn't catch on in time. The iconography was confusing to me and I didn't understand how limited the dice were at first. Your game can quickly be ruined if you go for tech and planets that are too expensive early. I definitely want to try this again some day.

(Based on one 2-player game), using the same background as it's parent, 'Race for the galaxy', an interesting dice allocation game with the similar twin goals of either using up all the Victory Point tokens or hitting 12 tiles in the tableau. Lacks the simplicity of the cards-only game but conversely, does not require the players to memorise the infamously-complex iconography of "Race".

Inferior to its older brother in every possible way. I particularly dislike how the military strategy basically doesn't stand out from the other approaches in this game. I will admit that the dice system that the designer conceived here is a clever one. Maybe if I hadn't already known RFTG I would have liked this one more, but for now I can see absolutely no reason why to play this instead of the original.

I think what makes this game so much fun is the combination of aesthetic and experience that just makes you want more.

Not too many games carry that feel for me.

Race for the Galaxy with dice. This game seems like it would be easier to pick up than Race for anyone who had trouble with the original. But, it's not an easy game with no rules... gamers will be more likely to just pick up and play than most. I'd play it again, but I won't seek it out.

Fun game, very nice dice and tiles, and I like solving how to maximize the outcomes of every roll. It's also a pretty quick game once players know the rules. My favorite part is how much luck mitigation can be involved. Through careful selection of what to work towards, you can really end up with lots of applications for what may have been "useless" rolls.

The dice rolling, the tile drawing and the placing of the dice to the corresponding phase implement even more luck than in Race for the galaxy. It is a well designed game, but I certainly prefer the card game.

I had not played Race for the Galaxy before I played Roll for the Galaxy, so the learning curve was steep. Not just in remembering to do everything, and remembering the differences between "Develop" and "Settle," but in teaching the game to other people. It was easy to get mixed up. Having said all of that though, I can confirm that my fellow player and I had a good game. While it's compatible with two players, this definitely felt like a game best expressed on the higher end of its player number, 3 or 4 seems appropriate. 5 seems like it might get a little long.

I prefer this sequel to its predecessor, "Race for the Galaxy", not just because it uses dice, but because there are piles of dice and they are used in a very clever way to both plan actions and pick an action you want. You start off with some dice manipulation ability from the bat, and during the game get progressively better at manipulating dice, or add a lot more dice to use. The key here is to build your tile tableau engine to be as fruitful as possible on your turn.

Plenty of strategy and intensity in this one. I love most things about this game. My main complaint is that your only interaction with other players comes from figuring out which phases they will activate and using it to your advantage. I'm not sure this is ultimately a bad thing though, as engine building can be very frustrating when other players can easily break what you've built.

Highly recommend this one. As of 1/11/2017, this was once in my top 5 all time, and is currently firmly in my top 20. Doesn't hurt that the wife loves it too.

The problem with this game is very little interaction between players. Played with 4 and 2 players and you end up just  focusing on what to do with your dice and how to use your powers since the other players don't influence you almost at all (other than selecting the phase).

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
One of the more interesting dice games based on a previous game (usually they are not very good).  I like how the role choice comes through in this one, and it is was always a tough choice to try to figure out what others might do.  One I expect to play much more (at all player counts... Only 4 so far), however at this point I think I was expecting it to be a better game than it was.  There are interesting combos, but I am not sure for how many plays they will seem interesting.

So good...
It's quick to play, I can set it up in no time, so easy to teach to new players and after about 8 plays it still feels fresh. The mechanics are solid. There is never any downtime unless people take a few seconds to decide something. The randomness of the dice is mitigated by development powers. I love how every move you make matters, but it isn't entirely punishing that new players will get completely crushed and never want to play again.

It definitely feels a little imbalanced towards develop/settle strategies, but I only play 2p so that is probably the issue. I don't even really mind it too much either way.

Redoes Race for the Galaxy with dice. Easier to learn and get into. Less complicated decisions that you don't have all the information for. There's less well-defined strategy, but it comes with a game that's much easier to start playing. Collecting and rolling dice is also fun. 

Games can be 30 minutes if you push it or up to an hour. 

I would play this before Race for the Galaxy, but it doesn't quite replace it.

I love this game and I don't generally like games with dice.  There are so many ways to mitigate the luck of a dice roll and with a large variety of dice with different symbol distributions it doesn't feel chaotic.  It feels very calculated.  The engine building is great.  Should you develop technologies to help you mitigate the chance or should you roll the dice?

I am a fan of Race For the Galaxy, so was immediately interested in this variation on the theme. After one play with our game group, I was sold. There are all sorts of interesting decisions and lines of play to explore. It will be familiar to anyone who has played the card version but different enough to be a refreshing experience. I liked the card version but much prefer this implementation.  I'm looking forward to playing this a lot more.

Played it twice - so my rating might change if I play it again (probably downwards ...)

Obvious comparisons with Race for the Galaxy (which I like), overall Roll is less fun, more random and less depth - but has a ton of tiny text, lots of effects (potentially) to remember and it's pretty impossible to check what your opponents are doing, making it even more a heads down multi-solo affair.

Overall, solid 'meh'.

Very glad I tried before I bought.

10x10 2016, 2017. Although it's based on another game, Roll for the Galaxy feels a bit different than any other game I've played.  The Race for the Galaxy base is there and that's based on Puerto Rico.  So that action selection mechanism where your action is then shared by your opponents has some roots.  And tableau building is nothing new.  But combine that with the dice chucking and somehow it feels very different.  There's something so tactile and fun and rattling a bunch of different colored dice around.  Plays quick and has some depth.  Also, somehow this is easier to teach and get into than Race.

Easier to explain and play than its card-based predecessor, this game still covers a lot of the same ground. Does it quite well, too. The dice add some randomness to the game; but with all the reassignment abilities, the overall effect feels less random. I'm still trying to get some more games in, which might drive the rating up further.

Initial impression (4 games): This is an excellent game with wide appeal.  It plays quickly, is clever, and yet is very easy to learn.  

Race for the Galaxy is all about figuring out which one or two cards in your hand you are actually going to play, while using the rest to pay for them.  The angst of paying with perfectly good, usable cards is a necessary byproduct of the tough decisions the game presents, but it feels bad.  In contrast, Roll for the Galaxy feels good.  You are at the mercy of the dice, but you have enough power to make just about any roll work for you.  That power feels good.  Getting more dice feels good.  Hearing those dice rattle in your cup feels good.  

This is a game that wants people to like it, and it succeeds admirably without becoming less game.

The dice are fun! But the most multiplayer solitaire that has ever solitaired.

(I think it aims to do different things than Race with its design, but in comparison, it lacks the nuanced interaction, the compelling hand management, the depth, the speed, is more random - it even takes up more table space!)

One play.  Hard to rate.  It's true to Race.  Don't have a feel for the building related things aspect.  I just built a lot of buildings to get a lot of dice.  Game is fine,  Mechanics are interesting.  Just not sure I want to play it again.

After a couple more plays, I really like the selection mechanic.  Still don't feel that I have a grasp of the game, but it's worth playing.

Allan gave me this game for Christmas 2015. I have played twice (2 players but I was both of them) ao far and I love it. I love the dice, I love how fast it is, I love building up my dice pool and world/technology tableau. It's just great. I'm still working on focusing on the worlds you begin with and just trying to build from there. I may try some solo games where I just roll for both other people. Sometimes you MAY be able to guess your opponent's choice of activating but not always. So hopefully playing solo but rolling 2 randomizer dice will make it fun to get the combos down and stuff. I'm very excited though and I love the game!

I've played this with 2, 3, 4, and 5 players. Always a fun experience for sure.

Great first game of this - at Gamealot 2015. Would definitely like to try again. I think I like this more than Race for the Galaxy, which I haven't played in quite a while. My memories of Race though are that it is more all-over-the place in terms of types of cards: too dense and convoluted. Roll definitely seems more streamlined, and if I could straight-up trade my copy of Race for Roll I would.

10/03/15: Second play, bumped from 7.5 to an 8. Good pace, interesting strategies.

Highly recommended, be ready to spend 30 minutes wrapping your head around it, but once over the hump the learning curve really levels out and allows for some delicious choices. One of my favs.

EDIT: Having now played Race for the Galaxy(which I loved), I can see how one could own both of these as they are quite different. Race is more combo-rific than Roll is, but this game has a real intuitive feel to it that I can't help but love. It's a euro that you can play from the gut, and reading the other players is more important I think than in it's predecessor. I don't play this as often anymore, sadly, but whenever I do, I am just blown away by how good it is. Still love Roll... may buy Race too?

It is simpler than Race, partly through clarification of the symbology, but partly through the mechanisms.

A wonderful reimplementation of another very good game. It doesn't really feel like a dice game (any more than, say, Castles of Burgundy feels like a dice game). The dice just give you options, and if you don't like your options, there are ways to change them. 

Some of the development powers are incredibly powerful, and certain combos can occasionally result in a runaway leader. But the game is short and light enough that it doesn't bother me. It just means you can play again!

Roll has grown on me. When I first played it I liked how all the game mechanics fit together and the nice decisions about building your tableau and generating enough income, but it just seemed kinda random - too random really. Not so much about the dice; I like the way the different dice work quite a bit. It was more about the tile draws. Sometimes you get nice, synergizing tiles and sometimes you waste turns of exploring trying to find something that remotely works. The card game has the same thing of course, but you cycle *much* more quickly in the card game and see a lot more cards. In Roll, the homeward combo plus your initial tile draws can make a huge difference; good matches and you can just start playing, otherwise you may still be digging for something, anything, after everyone else already has an engine going. I've been saddled with Space Pirates plus Epsilon Eridani a couple times, and it's a terrible combo - no dice into the cup initially, no production world, and a very poor early-game money generation power, when money is so critical. It makes to tough to win. Given all this, I think the explore action is a little pricey and there aren't enough exploration-booster tiles in the bad.

Also, the iconography is not great. After the crisp, clear Race for the Galaxy design, Roll for the Galaxy is a bit of a muddled mess and you end up having to fall back to the text, which (of course) is too small and not readable enough.

Still, I think this can all be true - it probably is - and the game can still be quite fun, even very good - which I think it probably is. Like Race, sometimes you don't get the cards, and it's a game about managing and coping with a quickly-changing playing environment, one where you not only have to manage your own stuff but take advantage of everyone else's actions. The dice management strategies are related to, but quite different from, Race. The game is streamlined, plays quickly and easily, it's great that there is so much simultaneous plotting and so limited downtime (a recurring bugbear for dice games). There is a lot to like. I suspect the balance probably isn't quite where it should be, but it's close enough to make for a fun game.

Strategy Note: Early game income is of course the key. You have to do everything in your power to get some kind of income engine going early, at the expense of any kind of long-term strategy. You can develop strategy once you've got the means to support cycling enough dice to give you options.

Just a random note: Race was really terrific as a 2-player game. Roll is just OK, and is much better multiplayer. 3 or 4 is probably the sweet spot. 5 is fine too.

Many times, the dice version of a game is obviously just a cash grab on the property, with the dice game being some silly little watered down version of the original.  However, with Roll for the Galaxy, it is evident that much thought went into the game to make it stand on it's own legs, which is great to see!

If you're familiar with Race, Roll has almost all familiar ideas, just implemented in a way that makes the game work extremely well with a dice management system as the main engine.  Many aspects of the game have been cleverly streamlined to allow it to work very well and stand alone, while maintaining all of the familiarity of the original.

If you like loads of custom dice that come together for a very good game, and you like Race for the Galaxy, I don't see much reason you wouldn't like this.

The dice version of Race for the Galaxy is a fun and relatively quick Euro-style game with lots and lots of rolling. The game can be a bit daunting at first with the multitude of icons to learn and the rules of each action, but once you get started, it's very easy to understand. Components are nice and the dice are very colorful, which helps in bringing in players. Despite the randomness of the dice rolls, there is enough ways to mitigate your rolls that I never felt cheated out of some points. Definitely recommended for anyone who enjoys a good dice game!

I enjoyed my play of Roll for the Galaxy and think it is a very good design.  It's probably the best possible outcome of a RftG dice game.

However, I definitely prefer Race as it felt like the dice hamstrung my ability to leech off others actions and predict what others would do.  I also wasn't too fond of being stuck with developing/settling the top tile in your stack or not being able to cycle through the tiles to get what you want.

TEXT ON THE CARDS! THANK FUCKING CHRIST!

This game made me realize just how esoteric RftG's iconography really is - because even when paired with explanatory text I still stare at it and my eyes glaze over in confusion.

Anyway - this alone is a huge win and makes the game a lot easier to get into. This captures much of the feel of Race in a pretty substantial dice game. Quite possibly the meatiest dice game I've played. There's lots of good little decisions here - particularly in the double-sided tiles. Good stuff!

Update: It took me awhile to really suss out the strategies here - for a long time I just could not figure out how to manage balance my dice/money economy, but after two wins in a row last night I think I've finally got it!

So yeah it took longer here for the strategy to really click with me, but a dozenish games in now and I think Roll may end up having better longevity than Race. One of the big things is just because of the variety of starting tiles! It's such a small change but it has such a huge impact. And of course, the dice. They've done a really excellent job of balancing the randomness such that it influences the choices you make, without being wholly beholden to your rolls.

I will say this lacks some of the tension I find in Race's cards-as-currency system for me. There's tough choices, but nothing feels quite as agonizing to me as having to discard 2 cards I really want for a planet I desperately need.

Do I like this more than Race now? The answer is... "quite possibly."

God I thought I was done with Race for the Galaxy. 

Just too much of a pure engine-builder, optimization game for me to find it very interesting. 

I like that you have to consider what other people are likely to take for their action, but there is a little too much double think there. I often needed to take an action, assumed another player who also needed to would, but they also passed with me in mind. Sometimes people just don't roll what they need and you can't leech so careful thought is often not rewarded, maybe too often than seemed comfortable to me -- Taking into account what dice they have, and how many pips of actions that die has seems possible but beyond the scope of where I want to go in this game. --

In the end, just not the kind of game for me. I still find that Puerto Rico does this kind of action selection better than any other game and in pretty much the same amount of time.

Having played RollFTG I have had to decrease my rating of RaceFTG – I’m probably not going to play Race now that I’ve tried this! It’s not that I like Roll for the Galaxy a lot, but it just fixed some of the problems I had with Race for the Galaxy.

It takes care of the fiddly icons; yes, Roll also features a lot of icons, but they are much, much more intuitive, and there is also some text on the tiles which explains what they do! I’ve found that Roll makes more sense and is easier to explain.

Roll is a VERY ”solitaire” game – you really can’t do anything to beat your opponent… This might be a negative for many players, but I found that it was a quite pleasant experience to puzzle with your own player board. The interaction comes in the phase selection where you need to guess which phases the other players are going to activate so you can benefit from that. Cool little mechanism.

It’s a dice game, yes. That means that there is bound to be a certain amount of luck, and yes, you can roll horribly bad and be screwed for a round, but it shouldn’t be too devastating throughout the game – mainly because there are ways to manipulate the dice rolls! First of all you can use any die to activate one (and only one!) phase, it doesn’t have to match. And you can also use “dictate”; i.e. spend exactly one die, which you cannot use this round but will get back for free for the next round, to change any other die to whatever you want. This makes the game flexible and is something I was impressed with during my plays. And even if you do make a crappy roll and cannot activate much, you simply get the dice back for free for the next round, so you get compensated. Oh, and speaking of the dice, I like that there are 7 different kinds and that they have different chances of rolling the different phases. An example; the red dice don’t have any shipping, so if you get a lot of red dice you probably just want to settle a lot of planets.

I also like the various phases, but I especially have to accentuate the explore phase; a very important phase as it’s one of the ways of getting income (which you need to buy dice each rounds) and the only way of getting new planets/developments. And when you draw new tiles from the bag, you can always decide to throw away your old planets in order to draw additional tiles – so even if you got a bad tile, you can always just discard it in the next explore phase if you want. That’s pretty cool!

I’ve played it with 2 and with 4, and both player counts work well! The 2p version has a dummy player which actually works okay, although it’s a little more random compared to guessing which phases the other players are going to activate (because you can make educated guesses)! The game takes about half an hour across the player counts, which is a perfect length in my opinion.

Like Race there are two main strategies: using trade to get VPs (which is a slower strategy but has potential for a lot of points) or rushing to get 12 planets and ending the game before the other strategies start to shine.

Lots to like here, fits right in. I do like the card game better because it's less fiddly and easier to play, but Roll is great implementation.

I've described this game as Race for the Galaxy meets Quarriors.  It's a fun, faster-paced (or at least it feels faster-paced) remix of Race for the Galaxy that substitutes cards for oodles of custom dice.

It's a fun game that's gone over well with every group I've introduced it to.  The core mechanics are difficult to explain, and new players definitely feel overwhelmed by the (necessary) explanations of what the six actions do.  But after a few rounds (and rounds go by very quickly) everyone gets the hang of it, and we're off to the Race[s].

The game has enough strategic diversity to keep it feeling fresh.  The high-randomness doesn't feel oppressive, and you get the feeling that the game still rewards strategy and forward-thinking, despite the fact that it's all dice rolls and random tile draws.

The only real down-side is that there is almost zero player interaction, making the game effectively multi-player solitaire.  Race for the Galaxy also suffers from this somewhat.  It's not a deal-breaker, but for players who like interaction this game could feel lacking.

No reason to care about the planets or techs other than what they do. Games always keep my interest throughout. Feels very well thought out.

I don't like the dramatic lack of player interaction.  What people do in their tableau makes no difference.  I find players spend more time looking at their dice rolls than the game state.

It's also terrible that you can't do the action unless you happen to roll the action someone else picked.  Thus the player gets a consequence free action which is bad for a role selection game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Best role selection game out there. Fast playing with excellent decision space. The thematics are a bit thin given the nature of the game, but it plays fast enough to overlook that. I consider this a "must have" for any serious gamer.

I'm not one to complain about the "solataire" aspect of games, but this one is a little over the top. The big interaction is the choosing of actions to be active that round, but the random dice really take away a lot of options for tactical play in that area.  It's a neat game, but it does somewhat play itself.

Intereting first play.  I can see the similarities to Glory to Rome.

The explore action with money compensate the way produce consumed is changed.  As Race you need 2 locations pair to run produce consume strategy, which has been reduced to 1 in Roll, I can see how explore buff up the explore/expand strategy.  I still think it's not the best strategy though, especially as settle/develop eats up dice.

These are only 2 things that concern me after first play.

Need more plays.

After a first play we played through this one a bit too fast, and I am sure we missed a few rules along the way. The action selection works well with the dice and there are some nice tiles that can produce some good combos. You can definitely get some nice bonuses for each of the actions and it definitely is good to explore to get dice back as much as you can. I definitely want to try this one again and it definitely has the "just one more game" feel.

Although the game play is so solitaire, it is not a problem for me.  From the strategic point of view, I prefer to the Race for the Galaxy.  But it is fun to roll and arrange actions!  Getting more fun after 3 plays!  Lack of user interaction is the main drawback of this game.

Love San Juan, so this reimagining of the reimagining (Race for the Galaxy) of the reimagining (San Juan) of the original (Puerto Rico) get high marks. Adding dice and double-sided tiles was GENIUS.
This is my favorite game that I have played with 2+ players.

RATING: 6
I'm at odds about whether or not I want to like this game. 

Pros:
Once you get past the initial learning plateau, the game is pretty easy to understand.  An entire round may happen in less than a minute, especially if everyone is familiar with the rules.  

I like the fact that as a development strategy, you have to choose between technologies, settling new worlds, getting money (which helps with the first two), and scoring points to win the game. 

You're constantly wanting to make the best move you can at the mercy of the random die rolls, but fortunately as the game goes on you can increasingly mitigate that randomness and develop a strategy. 


Cons:
For one, the biggest gripe I have is that the player interaction is fairly minimal at best.  Yes, it is pretty much group solitaire.  You can try to predict what your opponents are going to do.  If you're lucky, you'll get additional action types per turn, but that's IT as far as interaction goes.  There's never a need to talk/negotiate/threaten/cooperate at all, you just have to announce what phase the game is currently in.  

The game feels rather short.  The rules specify that the game ends when the victory point pile is empty or one player reaches twelve total tiles in their "tableau."  In my opinion this happens way too quickly.  Sometimes within about 15 minutes.  The player who reaches 12 tiles first is often going to the the winner, even if they mostly ignored collecting actual victory points.  

Overall, I like the fact that there is variety each time you play as you start with a new faction/homeworld, and new technologies/dice to acquire.  

What I don't like is that underneath that superficial layer of randomness, the game isn't all that complex or deep.  It's an OK game, but perhaps it's missing one more layer, like incentivized/cooperative trading between players, an opportunity for military engagements, or actual setbacks challenges to building a space empire. 

As it stands, the game is a nice stepping stone into a larger genre but too simple for me to enjoy consistently.   I'll try the expansion packs

This game seems built for a very particular audience that has exhausted Race but still wants to solve a new puzzle covering very nearly the same decision space.  In this sense the game is totally derivative.  But calling this game derivative seems like an silly criticism.  

So, let's start again.  Roll is an exceptionally well-wrought game that nonetheless feels totally unoriginal once you get past the the initial charm of rolling pretty bits of plastic. I'm not a huge fan of the original game, but I'm always happy to play it.  Roll for the Galaxy removes the central questions of its older brother and replaces it with silly roll optimization and dice play.  Interested in this game?  Go buy a copy of Race for the Galaxy.  Already have that game?  Play it more. Tired of Race for the Galaxy? Find something harder or more interesting.

I liked this game although given the choice I would likely pick Race over it 7 times out of 10. Roll would get the nod based on speed of set up and honestly the novelty factor.

more so than race, this game really creates a sense of isolation where the rest of the other players don't feel a part of your game. i can't quite explain why this doesn't feel as stark in race but it may just be my familiarity with that game.

well worth it to play though and I can see many folks liking this more.

I actually like this game quite a bit.  I'm not being derogatory with that first sentence, just honest.  If that makes sense to you, then buy this game.
This totally replaced Race for me, mainly because it can play five people.  With this and San Juan available, I have a hard time understanding why people still play Race.

This game is a blast. I haven't played it enough yet (loud dice and sleeping children don't mix). Usually I play it 2 player, but it shines with 4 or more! The fun part of this game is the dice manipulation and "pokering" your opponents so they place dice on actions they think you will take. Sure people could cheat at this game fairly easily, but I don't play with those people.

There are lots of things to love here. It really captures the feeling of RftG, but manages to be its own game. 

Components: The dice are small, but adequate and there are TONS of them in the box. The tiles are nice and thick, but the tile bag is too small. The money markers for the players are somewhat ambiguously shaped, but that just means you get to decide whether yours is a astronaut or a space ship. Love that it includes dice cups (I'm a sucker for dice cups) and that the box is the same dimensions as the Dominion box.

Gameplay: The gameplay is good and pretty easy to understand and teach. The player screen doubles as a player aid and does a good job of capturing all the important rules. The thing I like least is waiting for people to futz with their dice behind their screens. It makes the game go slowly and you constantly need to ask people if they are ready. Turns can happen simultaneously (as in RftG) which is chaotic and makes it feel less like you are playing a game with others and a lot more like you are playing by yourself. This is compounded by the fact that the text on the tiles is small and hard to read at any distance so you can't easily tell what your opponents have going for them. This could be mitigated somewhat by better knowledge of the powers by tile name.

Verdict: Some fun. I'm happy to play, but I'm probably not going to suggest it mostly because of the player downtime and solitaire-feeling gameplay.

Gift from my amazing Secret Santa 2016 and it became at once my new favourite game! A perfect 10 when combined with the Ambition expansion as it really needs more starting worlds and factions for replayability.

Update: After several plays the only thing that annoys me is that it finishes too quickly. 12 worlds/developments feels too little so we're gonna experiment with more.

It's hard to grade this game without referencing "Race for the Galaxy." A couple elements hold "Roll" back from the lofty heights of its older brother One is the lack of bonuses for selecting a particular phase. I thought that element added a lot of strategy to "Race" and I feel its absence here. (Though it's worth noting that this - along with a reduction in symbology reliance - make "Roll" and easier game to learn.)

The other issue I have with "Roll" is that I don't dig the premium placed on correctly guessing how your opponents will place their dice. Reading your opponents is a big part of many games and usually I don't mind it because there's usually some other viable path to take if you guess wrong. But here, if you've loaded a bunch of dice in a phase that nobody picks, you're pretty much screwed. String a few wasted rounds like that together and voila! You're out of the game, perhaps well before its ending.

Despite these issues, "Roll" remains a very fun game. If you like dice games and/or don't feel like dealing with the oppressive symbology of "Race," then this might be right up your alley.

I was surprised by the fact how fast this can be.

It is a really cool game, fun and fast rounds with almost no downtime. I've never felt like I have no good option or even better usually I felt like I have more good options.

I have only one negative thing to say: it is not so easy to pick it up. In the beginning it seems to be a bit overwhelming. And the rulebook is missing to clarify a few rare occasions.

I like this more than the card game. It's been long enough since I played the card game that I can't exactly articulate why. The game just seems to work well with dice, I guess. The only obvious ding is that the game is (still) heavily multi-player solitaire. The most interaction you can hope for is guessing what actions other players will select. But since it's simultaneous, there's a bit of prisoner's dilemma. The only other ding, if you can call it that, is that the game is not auditable by players. Meaning that players have to roll the dice behind their own screen, then arrange them, all of which is done secretly. It would be trivial to change faces if someone wanted to. Meaning that players should not even think about playing this with others who are prone or tempted to cheat, or even with players prone to suspicion of others. It requires complete trust in others. For me that's fine with most people I play with, fortunately.

This is a streamlined version of Race for the Galaxy, using dice instead of cards, which is always better! :D

Plus the phases order has been changed, simplifying the acquisition of victory points through production.

Each player roll its dice and sort them behind its screen. Then, he chooses a phase to be played this turn.

After the screens are lifted, all the chosen phases take place, players acquire new tiles, put tiles in play, produce ressources, acquire new dice and gain victory points.
Then another turn begins.

Very fun (more so than the card, in my opinion)!

It's Race For The Galaxy with dice. Great game, great production, smooth gameplay with variable setup. Veterans can dive right in, pursuing largely the same strategies and combos from RftG.

More approachable, yet slightly less brilliant than its predecessor.

Overall, a "deck builder" or "engine builder".  I've played about a half-dozen times and it just doesn't work for me. It's a standard euro-style "playing solitare in a group" type game. There's really no interactions between other players and no way to really affect their plays, so I don't even bother watching what they are doing. (sure, I could look and try to figure out what action they are going to do this turn, but I just don't see the point.) I find the variety of dice colors and faces overwhelming.  in short, it feels like an exercise to roll dice with no real reason for doing so. The theme is completely ignorable.

I was initially concerned that it would be too complicated to be fun but the mechanics are great at mitigating the randomness of the dice such that you're always left with a little flexibility to act.

RATING: 6
Over hyped, over priced. This is another one of those games like Caverna, is claim to fame is it isn't Agricola, doesn't has the warts it has, the dated feeling. Caverna is nothing more then a church activity, a kitty litter box vs sandbox.

I have no interest in Race for the Galaxy, just too many icons, the learning curve, this blocks newbie playing as the experience players will ruin it.

In Roll for the Galaxy there is nothing clever or new here, it does feel like you seen this game before , the dice being the difference,  and I am not talking about Race for the Galaxy. 

It's better the Dice Master, with its over expensive cost,  running well over $100, all its rehashed versions of the same old same old,  some word processing type cranking on new card text, so if you need a dice game RftG isn't bad. The tile text could use bigger text to see at a distance. It's just isn't  revolutionary.

For the money I don't understand the lack of engraved dice? The dice are the size of Dice Master but unlike DM, RftG the images seem to be painted, silk screened on? This is a big deal to me for a game retailers  at $60, below $40 seems more like it.

The short play time is a plus but can't say I like the hidden rolling of the dice. It's a bit like solitaire, guess it's no different then drawing cards str8 from a draft, but still it's rather a  nuisance lowering their screen bring it back up.

Looking at other players tiles for insight into what they may play, select is problematic, and this is the only player interaction and I would really won't call it that.

My guess is the expansion might add a little to the needed interaction? Doesn't it have goals, or first achieved?

Could have been more room in that box for storage.

Still it is playable, if it were any longer would not be worth playing.

Playing this was kind of surreal. All these worlds and developments that I *know*, but which don't do what I know they do, but do work together much like I'd expect...

A little bit heavier and more strategic than its counterparts (Race for the Galaxy). Strange, since usually with dice everything seems to be more "casual", but not this one. It feels more thematic, more strategic, and somehow more fulfilling.

So much fun to play! Best game of 2015 (so far). I actually like it more than Race for the Galaxy. The dice mitigation mechanisms are very innovative. It doesn't really play like any other dice game I've ever played.

Unfortunately, in my experience (but contrary to the designers'), the produce/consume strategy seems underpowered compared to a simplistic explore/settle strategy. I find that a little frustrating because I enjoy the challenge of finding the worlds that synergize well with each other and gaining and using the appropriately colored dice for producing and shipping to maximize victory points. That just seems a lot more fun to me than just settling a bunch of low-cost worlds as fast as possible, but that simplistic strategy usually wins. I think the game desperately needs an expansion to flesh out and boost alternative strategies.

I admit I initially bought this game mostly because of the number of dice included.

But thankfully it turned out to be a really good game. I have never played Race for the Galaxy, but had heard of it and knew it was generally well liked.

Then I heard people say this was better.

The mechanics are easy to pick up and the games don't take long as all players are going at the same time (all experienced players can make games very quick!).

There are a good number of tiles in the game and the random selection of these make games different to each other, allowing for replay-ability.

I don't see me turning down a chance to play this, anytime soon.

Pretty fun, but we had to ban the piracy starting faction. That card is on a whole other power level than any of the others. 
Besides that, it's a pretty fun game. It actually plays a lot like a planting and harvesting game, tbh. Pretty clever.

As a big fan of Race (well, at least the base game and 1st expansion), and although I've only played Roll twice thus far, I think Roll might be even better than Race.  It's all the flavor of Race, but with even more strategic decisions and 111 dice!  And not to worry, there's a ton of ways to mitigate wonky dice rolls in this very well designed game.  And it also looks like it plays 2-5 very well (I played 2-player last night).

I haven't played Race so can't compare the two. I love the mechanics of the game - there's a decent amount of strategy here, and although there is obviously a big chunk of luck with the dice-rolling, there's plenty of mitigation that should mean it doesn't affect you too much. What I did find is that the luck of your starting tiles actually affects the game far more, and it's frustrating when you get a bad combination.

Rate 7 after 2 plays. Won't be adding it to my collection. Feels fun and probably a lot of strategy in there to find. But the big knock is the multiplayer-solo feel of the game. Sure you got to be interactive to guess what the other player is trying to do, but that interactivity didn't come out naturally.

After a number of plays, I think this is going to be purged.

In short, I just don't see why I'd play this over Race.  At least Jump Drive (the other member of the Race family) takes 10-15 minutes (though 2PA Race takes maybe 20-25...), while Roll takes the same time as Race.

Further, Roll is very restrictive, by the nature of the dice rolls and also by the limited number of tiles that you see.  That last point is understated, I think, and it took me a long time to see it as the reason I don't like this as much.  The main problem is that, when you ship goods, you get money instead of cards.  In Race, Trading a good could get you a grip of cards, which could either provide you with what you needed, or could give you a whole new direction.  In Roll, you just get money to get your dice back.

With Race, you get two ways to find a new strategy: Explore (esp. Deep Explore) or Consume:Trade.  With Roll, you only get Explore, which itself is far more limiting (you need a lot of dice to see a lot of tiles).  Coupled with the fact that Roll starts you with 3/12 tiles in your Tableau, you are very much steered in one direction and are just hoping that the tiles support that. 

Because of this, Roll games feel very much on rails, but with the off-chance that your plans just won't work due to the roll of the dice.  Race requires far more thought about choosing and pursuing a strategy.

Having played Race for the Galaxy a fair bit, it was harder than I expected to shift gears into this one.  My friends who had not played Race enjoyed it more than I did.  I think the artwork and dice are well done, but Race is already a somewhat complex card game, and when you add in the dice, there's a decent chance that you just will not be able to execute your plans even with the best planning.

Man, I just want to eat these dice like they're candy. I imagine the purple dice taste like cotton candy and the green like sour apple and the white like marshmallow. I want to shake them around in my colorful cup and pour them right down my gullet.

The fact that I don't is testament to the fact that I really like this game and that I think rolling these colorful and delicious dice to do neat things like explore planets and develop new technologies and produce weird alien goods is incredibly neat. It plays quickly, has a surprising depth of strategy, and the theme is actually very delightful if you allow yourself to slow down and take a look at what that planet you've been settling actually is. It's low on player interaction but, in a game of this length with such brisk pacing, I don't mind nearly as much as I would otherwise.

Takes the best parts of Race for the Galaxy and dice-placement games and folds them into one very tidy package.  This game has a fantastic pace about it, and if you play with people who aren't prone to AP, you can wrap it up in under half an hour.

Unfortunately, after half a dozen plays, it already feels stale.  I'm told the expansion adds more variety, but I'd really like to have seen that replayability in the base game.

Race for the galaxy est devenu un classique dans le monde ludique. Une référence même. Comme d'autres avant lui, sa version "jeu de dés" vient d'arriver. Et c'est plutôt une réussite. Déjà, il y a des masses de dés dans la boîtes. Ensuite, il permet de ressentir le plaisir de jeu de son aîné, tout en étant un peu plus simple (j'allais dire, moins expert). Construisez votre pool de dé, bâtissez vos planètes, récoltez vos ressources. Et puis si ça ne vous plait vraiment pas, vous pouvez toujours tester une variante "Perudo for the galaxy".

Roll for the Galaxy has the same fun as Race for the Galaxy for me.  I do like the way that the dice add a visual component to the game.  Since I don't get to play Race very often, it is nice that Roll has that extra mechanic that helps you visualize what is going on.
And I just like dice.
For me it scratches the same itch as Race, but is much more accessible.

I liked this a lot at first, but the game may have have too much going on for my tastes, particularly with the expansion. There are many times times that I have found myself so absorbed in trying to maximize my roll that I have forgotten about some power I have. I enjoy playing it, but feel that I may never have enough comfort with it to just sit back and enjoy it (or maybe I just need to play it more often!). Also, there's a blandness to it that it's older brother didn't have...shouldn't it feel a bit more like space exploration? In play this could be about almost anything.

I've decided I would just far rather play the original, or even Jump Drive, than the dice game and am trading it away.

Very nice dice version of Race for the Galaxy. If I have to choose between the two, I'd go for Roll. Luck and tactical decision making are very well balanced, resulting in a fluently playing fun game. I particularly like the fact that the colour composition of your dice influences the probability of you being able to perform the different actions. This increases the importance of the type (colour) of planet you choose to colonise.

The problem is, every player is on their own. Turns go simultaneously, so you even don't have enough time to investigate what other players are doing. Interaction between players is narrowed to the very nice mechanics of determining the active phases of the game round, and generally that's all.
I like the game, it feels like a very good solitaire, it has some charm, it plays very well, it is very well balanced, and it has numerous dice! But I can't name it the best of the best.

No idea yet what the eventual rating will be, but it's only taken one play of Roll for me to like this version sooo much more than its Race forefather. 

It seems I can only like either the original or the dice variant, but not both. By that logic, probably explains why I love the original Pandemic, but hate Pandemic: The Cure.

Cool use of dice in this game. I like how you kind of gamble on what other players will be choosing to program with their turns in order to accomplish more than just your top priority in the round. 

The problem for me was the iconography on the player sheets and game components. As an avid gamer, I've learned to recognize good graphic design and iconography for actions etc. in a game. This game was the opposite. If they could redo this game with improving on this area, I'm sure I'd find it more enjoyable and less of a chore. As is it caused way too many clarifying questions for the group I played with.

Pros: Stellar quality components, from the colorful dice, cups, player boards and shields, bags and tiles. Dice are fun to manage. Lots of tactical and strategic decisions to make every turn.

Cons: Open to player cheating due to hidden screen, though used dice must be re-bought and playing with trustworthy people offsets this.

Manipulating the dice in this game is different enough that it stands as its own game next to Race.

Dropped the rating by one since I don't find myself trying to get it to the table as much as I once did. With most of the plays being two player, I feel like it's easy to pace with the other player and avoid feeling like there's too much to do with not enough time. Still a game I enjoy to play and will probably bring out more after a short break.

Dropped rating by 1/2 a point after playing recently. Still an excellent tableau building game with the joy of rolling tons of dice. The game does come down to a bit of luck in terms of dice rolls and tile drafts. Will be keeping this to introduce new players into slightly heavier games or when I want something lighter weight to play.

Dropping the rating to a 7. It's a game that doesn't really have a set opening or moves you should make but the play is getting fairly repetitive. The theme of space / world building is mostly ignored at this point and it has become basically symbol manipulation and probability.

Every game is very different. Very early on, after considering your home faction and world, and your early random tiles, you see a path to take.  In one game, I focused on producing/shipping for VPs, then the next game it was all about developing developments.  \

Race for the Galaxy is one of my favorite games of all time and somehow I was a little reluctant to get a dice version of it. After reading some reviews and watching [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/video/62923/roll-galaxy/rahdo-runs-through-roll-galaxy]Rahdo's Runthrough[/url], I gave in and aquired a copy. And I'm glad I did.

While my first play saw me struggling more with the system than doing anything to win me the game, my second game already showed me that Roll for the Galaxy contains all the combo building goodness that I like in Race and some more: Roll for the Galaxy features one of the best use of dice I've seen in any game. You have a lot of control over your faith and if you even manage to get a reassign development into your tableau, you can almost always do something good with what you rolled. Brilliant!

Currently, I do enjoy Race for the Galaxy a tad more than it's dice version because I feel it allows a bit more strategic planning. Nevertheless, I do really like the delicious tactical puzzle posed by the dice. So for now, I'll settle with an 8.
Roll for the Galaxy is just a lot of fun to play and I hope that I can get it to the table a lot in the future.

Limited ability to modify dice rolls out of the box means the game makes too many decisions for you. Developing and Settling strategically can add dice-roll modification options, but comes at the cost of developing a Production/Shipping engine, which seems strong. And not convinced about rolling dice secretly behind screens. #OnePlayJudgement (May 2015)

I never played Race for the Galaxy but Roll is a brilliant space themed dice rolling game. It combines engine building, future planing, and social deduction (guessing what other's will choose for their phase) in a really tight game. It's my girlfriend's favorite game sofar and is simple enough to teach to non gamers.

Negatives: the symbols are really well done ONCE you know the game, but very confusing for new players. The game can be split into two parts: exploring, developing, settling, versus producing and shipping. If no one else is producing and shipping it can be difficult to go for that strategy.  

I personally love playing because you feel good when you're building your empire and even if you lose you have a good time. I can recognize its flaws but they are easy to move past once you understand the game.

Fairly fun and I like the shiny dice (although the colours could be better)  but it's not as good as 'Race'.

- There's more luck in 'Roll' than 'Race'. You have the luck of the draw of the tile (as per Race's card draw) but then you have the luck of the roll on top as well.
- People disappearing behind their screens to work their dice out makes it even more multi-solitaire.
- The digging in the bag multiple times in one round breaks the flow up more.
- Some of the tiles seem more overpowered than the cards (particularly the '5' devs).
- There are icons and there is lots of small text.
- Fiddly.
- There is more scope for the players/game to get out of step due to players operating at different speeds - I've been in games where one player has taken his next roll whilst others are still working out what to do with their previous one.
- The theme engagement is at yet one more level of abstraction than Race - i.e. 'Race' is abstractly representing the building and running of a space empire but 'Roll' is just abstractly representing 'Race'. The actions you are taking in 'Roll' only make thematic sense if translated via 'Race'.

Doesn't replace Race for me but this is the game I will turn to when I want a simpler experience. Makes Alien Artifacts obsolete I guess.

I really like how well it works with the dice and how they interact. Much more smooth than the card game. Perhaps a bit more multiplayer solitaire, but I guess they'll add military and stuff in an expansion. Seems to be overly dependent on getting some income going early in the game which deduct some from the game experience.

After some games I've lowered the rating. Simply too much multi-player solitaire for me, more so than the card game which I love and prefer over this.

I like this one better than Race for the Galaxy.   The iconography is easier to digest and plays more intuitive.  That said, there is a ton of luck in getting the right tile mix to allow you to combo.  On my first play I drew, what I think, is maybe a perfect draw and scored twice as many points as the other players.  So my worry is that in a 5er game, it is likely that at least one player draws into the right situation and dominates.  Keeping it at a 7 for now...until I know for sure.

Not a bad game, but I think Race for the Galaxy is meatier for my taste.

RATING: 7
A nice extension of the Puerto Rico/San Juan family, implementing dice in space of cards.  Surprisingly simple to teach and play.  Not a real lot of strategy involved as the game is over so quickly, you sort of have to luck into an engine to generate points that may win you the game.  After 12 games, every game seems to end with one player building out to 12 tiles - the points game end trigger never gets a look in.  Much better iconography compared to Race For The Galaxy, but won't replace Puerto Rico or San Juan at this stage.  Fun, fast, but definitely not a keeper (but neither was Race).

really cool mechanics and lots of interesting choices. not great for my current group since they're too slow / prefer lighter social games but i think with a good group of players this would be rated higher and get a lot more playtime. only concern is that the game could get stale after you learn all the tiles and find meta strategies, but it seems like it'd be really fun for at least 10 plays, and even after learning everything it could still be enjoyable to minmax the game

Very intelligent re-imagining of Race as a dice game.   At the end of the day, the question will undoubtedly be:  is this better than Race?   Well....   it's certainly longer and more fiddly.   The pace is slower.   But it still gives the same empire-building feel with a lot of interesting choices and a number of interesting strategies to pursue.   The double-sided tiles were an interesting design choice.   The Explore phase feels more complex, while everything else is simpler.   The player screen is really busy, but ultimately very functional and useful.  It definitely left me wanting to play again and again.... and again.   Has proven to be more approachable to those who are lukewarm (or worse) on Race.   Bumping rating up to 9.

RATING: 8
Completely and 100% replaces Race for the Galaxy for me, and mostly because it is so much easier to garner appeal in the game. When you're set up with your dice-cup, your collection of colorful dice and the prospect of gathering more, it's hard not to be eager to get started.

It should be said that, just like Race for the Galaxy, any play with new people is preceded by a fairly hefty rules dump that cannot really be reduced or avoided. It's vital to know all the ins and outs even to start playing, which can intimidate new players - but once they start, they'll quickly get the hang of it.

Interesting twist of Race for the Galaxy. Mechanic were not that easy to grasp from the rules on the first play, but it all clicked together before the second game. Components are great, rolling tiny colorful dice in cool cups is lot of fun. And it's still a race. But will less decision making. More plays is required to make the final judgement.

[b]Update:[/b] Downgraded from 8.5 to 7.5 for total lack of player interaction and mechanisms that will encourage monitoring and control. This almost requires no human opponents, but as a game it's fun. Also, there is little decisions to be made in the direction your civilization will go.

RATING: 6
I sort of enjoyed this but i think its a hot mess of a game. Its theme appears to be Race for the Galaxy, which on one hand is fine but if you have never played Race this game could feel completely arbitrary. It does have the predictability or the clean but difficult decisions of Race and is even more confusing. On the other hand, i find it more relaxing to play. Due to the unpredictability of dice, the game has even less player interaction than Race. In Race the key interaction was guessing your opponents next move, here it depends what they roll.

I'm not really sure who its for. Race fans might be disappointing as this won't be as competitively sharp. My guess is it exists to be BGG hotness for a while and satisfy people who need that big game of the month to explore the rules of over half a dozen plays and then discard.

If you are looking for a dice game that has more depth (and fiddley complexity) than anything else on the market though, this might be what you are looking for. Most dice games are Yahtzee rehashes this at least tries to be something different.

I have never played Race for the Galaxy, yet I have a strange fascination with dice.

I can't really comment on this just yet because I have a feeling that I haven't played it enough to truly get a handle on its intricacies.

It's fun, it's short, but it seems like it's over too soon.  Definitely need to play it more.

A very enjoyable, strategic dice rolling / dice management / tile management game. 
- At the beginning, the rules are complex, the iconography is more confusing than explaning. Expect a steep start. Luckily I my friend knows the rules and is an excellent explainer
- But once you get into the flow and start understanding the mechanics and possible tactics, it is just awesome!

I like my euros to be a little more brutal or a little more interactive.  Aside from phase selection, I forget that I'm playing the game with other people, and I generally start getting bored halfway through the game.

It's one of those rate games that I have absolutely no feelings for either way, and I can't seem to understand why so many people love it.  I also probably wouldn't understand why someone hated it.  I am extremely neutral when it comes to Roll for the Galaxy.  Well that's not entirely true.  I still get a kick out of runaway robots and galactic trendsetters.

Regarding Puerto Rico spinoffs, San Juan 2nd Edition still remains my favorite.

2017-04-23 : wasn't all that happy with the first game I played of it, but remembered my first experience of RFTG and agreed to a second game of it straight away and it was much, much better. Surprisingly for a dice game I think there's less luck involved than with RFTG, except that it's harder to predict what other players are going to pick for their main action. As there's more combinations of things that play of each other, it's also a more solitary game - you're quiet busy with managing your own empire, let alone study what the other players are doing - but maybe this gets better with a couple of dozen plays, who knows ?

I had never thought they would make a dice version of Race for the Galaxy, but it now exists. I actually think this is the first "the dice game" that I've actually enjoyed. It's not just me either, some people even prefer this to Race. I don't think I'm quite there, but at the time of writing this, I haven't played it nearly as much as Race. So, we'll see what happens with additional plays. I think one of the reasons for this game's success is that it has simplified Race since there is a choice of using text or iconography on the tiles and other aspects of the game have been simplified (cost of tiles = VP value, etc). One complaint about this game is that I don't like how dice are manipulated behind a screen. I do trust the people that I currently play with, but with the ease of being able to cheat in this game is usually in the back of my mind. I'm also extremely disappointed with the lack of etched dice. I was ok when the designer said they should be fine, but a friend's copy that didn't see too much play had worn dice. Definitely give this one a try, as the game play is fun!

RATING: 5.5
Muddy art, few interesting strategy decisions and weak theme integration make the game a bland experience that fails to engage the player's imagination. The game overstays its welcome, taking much longer than it should; playing the last few turns just seems like a chore. 

Random factors, especially phase selection, can be annoying and frustrating; I would have preferred a more predictable turn sequence. After rolling dice, you must allocate them to various phases to use them. You can select just one of five possible phases, and you must rely on other players' selections for activating other phases that you might need. As your freedom to allocate is limited, your plans can be frustrated because you can't predict the phase selections of your opponents, and your dice can spend the wasted turn inactive and feckless.

Factions (read: races), developments (read: technologies) and worlds don't add much individual character to a player's empire.  When you get Space Marines, you might think, "Wow, now I'll really have some kind of military power!"  In fact, you just get a red "military" die, which is much like other dice. There are minor differences in the mix of symbols on different dice, but the variations really add very little to game's theme.

Overall, weak theme, lack of engaging strategy decisions and longish playing time make Roll for the Galaxy a game I cannot recommend. Rating: 5.5.

A more accessible, dice-based iteration of Race For The Galaxy. Not quite as deep as the original, but easier to teach.

I like dice and I like Puerto Rico, ergo I like Roll for the Galaxy. It reconfigures the role selection mechanic from PR in a way that feels familiar, yet distinctly different. Developing worlds and technologies is fulfilling, and the short play time makes it a great candidate for double plays.

Played twice. It's good, but I prefer Race For The Galaxy. Compared to Race, this game is a bit more fiddly and in my mind, a bit more complex to explain. Yes, Race is infamous in it's use of icons, but the way information is presented on a single component (the card) is more straightforward. And it's not like there isn't just as many icons spread across the dice, tiles, and player screens.

The game feels well balanced, and if I don't do well I can trace it to something other than 'luck'.

Never played race for the galaxy before diving into this so the learning curve was a little high initially.  Goes a little slow for new players and people who overthink (like me).  Despite the dice it isn't real luck based because of all the modifiers.  Its tough to remember all the modifiers and have to keep reading what you have and keep up with the pace...a few more plays would probably fix that.  Requires an honest group of players because of the hidden dice rolling.  I didn't really think it was the most fun game overall.

You roll some dice then pick one of the five actions and try to guess what other players will be doing as actions. But if you roll bad or get some unlucky tiles your engine might not even start.

This is a great engine builder and I really suck at it. The dice rolling phase selection mechanic is a fantastic idea that makes you think in ways my other games don't. The tiles are cleverly thematic. The components are great. I had to take off a point though because the Developer strategy is a little broken, to the point where the designers had to use the expansion to re-balance it. The Ambition expansion is a must.

9 plays - 8: Still don't really know what i'm doing, bumbling through the game. Enjoyable so far, but should get a lot better with more plays.

Not yet really paying attention to what specific cards opponents have, just trying to manage my pool of dice and cards into some semblance of a strategy.


49 plays - 9.5: the rabbit hole deepens, and deepens. I still feel like i've only discovered the tip of the iceberg. My winrate is absurdly good, yet i still feel lost as to what the optimal play is in most/all spots.

Still don't know how to play engines very well. Mastered dev spam. Don't like worlds anymore.

Very enjoyable, getting close to a 10, but not quite there yet.


136 plays - 6: Explore Big Dev and Dev Spam seem to dominate far too much. Engines are only really viable with collusion / a sucker(s) willing to Produce or Ship for you. The extreme randomness of phase assignment eventually gets really, really annoying.

RATING: 7
It took me several plays to warm up this game but I’ve come to like it for what it is – a competitive, simultaneous puzzle race. I mean, I’d rather play Race itself, but this is a more relaxed version where you play against the dice first and the other players second. Player interaction is not absent but it’s not huge either. 

Sure, you can try and deduce what others will do often they don’t have the dice to do it. On many turns, people do things out of synch and finish up long before others because it just didn’t matter. It often feels very much MPS. The big challenge here is optimizing your own powers and dice each turn. And that's fun. When I first played the game, I found this shift in focus lame, but now I can enjoy the game as a plus filler.

Another reason not to take the game too seriously: the possibility to unintentionally knock over one's dice and forget what they were is very high. Just sayin'...

I bumbled my way through this game with two non-gaming friends .. For 6 hours!  I got all the winning conditions wrong .. 12 planets instead of 12 tiles, I kept all the victory points, forgot to give the starting world .. It took forever!

My NON gaming friends would not quit playing until the game ended.   They fell in love with the whole evolving strategy and noodling through the rules, the phases, and me continuously saying to them "those dice don't go in the cup .. Put them in your civilization".    

Now they want to buy their own copy!

A dynamic thematic role/action selection game that streamlines out the daunting iconography of Race for the Galaxy, but leaves in the best parts of it and adds some interesting "engines" (e.g., can do more than one developments/settle more than one world each turn) that Race doesn't have.  Normally, I shy away from "dice chucking" games but this one is the "glowing" exception to that rule.  Easily teachable to others (e.g., my entire family).

RATING: 7
I continue to find this game underwhelming compared to Race for the Galaxy. The randomness of the dice rolls removes much of the strategic fun for me.  Part of my enjoyment of RaceftG comes from the many different strategies that can lead to victory. Due to the uncertainty caused by the dice rolls, fewer strategies are successful in Roll.  However, Roll seems to be popular with players who find RaceftG's iconography and cards too confusing. So it ends up being an easier sell as an entryway game.

[EDIT] I've been told that the expansions open up the strategies to success.  I can't speak to that as I haven't played with them yet.

A great reimplementation of Race of the Galaxy. I hesitate to say that it's better than the original, but it may be. It does definitely solve some of RftG's issues, such as the hand limit that may forbid certain strategies, or the fact that produce-and-ship strategies required multiple turns in Race. It's not as great as a 2-player game, though, due to the randomness of the "neutral player" behavior. I would play this with 3+ players and Race with 2.

This game is just a lot of fun. It streamlines Race for the Galaxy, and then adds all the dice. Dice-chucking is a blast, but the game maintains its strategic feel and gives you so many different options to choose from. It also has a lot of engine-building mechanics to it, which make it a great planning game.

It's a dice game, but you have a lot of control over "bad rolls".

1. The die distributions are clearly marked on the play aid.  So settle worlds that give you the kind of dice you need.  Furthermore, when you're short on cash, buy back the dice that will suit what you intend to accomplish the next turn.

2. There are no re-rolls.  This is pretty uncommon in dice games.  Instead everybody has a "burn one to reassign one" power, which can be limiting on bad rolls in early turns.  It seems like you want to pick up a Reassign power or two along the way, they've served me pretty well.

I find it easier to "read" other people's intentions in this game, which is useful.  If they have a half-built six-cost, they're probably going to call develop.  If they have a bunch of goods out already, they're probably going to ship.

Also, the roll you call never has to match the face, so you always have one free die reassignment as well.

I feel like I can get more done in a turn in this game than I can in its parent game.

Note, however, that the two player game is much weaker IMO, probably only a 7 or so for me.  It's like playing a three player game where one of the players is a complete moron.

The dice pool building is great since each of the different colored dice offer a unique distribution of actions. In general, players have a lot of flexibility with assigning their dice to actions that they need when they need it, and can still have fun trying to piggy-back off others actions with any extra dice they might have. The developments offer a nice range of effects to help keep your strategies for each game varied and interesting.

I love playing this game, however the caveat to this is, much like it's predecessor Race for the Galaxy, teaching this game to new players leads to constant rule clarifications. I love the engine maintenance, the managing of income vs points is a constant struggle that takes good planning to payoff. The randomness of which tiles you gain may be the one part that I wish was more manageable (I get points for brown goods, but I can't do anything to assist getting specifically brown planet tiles outside of draw randomly from a bag). It does not dampen my experience enough to harm the game, but it is the one issue I wish could be more manageable.
The issue of dice colour vs tile colour, remembering some colours are wild and when colour matters seems to cause issues with new players and I would rather play with people that know how than teach from scratch. Especially with the full 5 player count.
All that aside, one of my favourite games in the collection and would play whenever possible.

RATING: 8.02
Roll for The Galaxy is a really fun, quick and exciting game that is easy to bring to the table, faster to teach than its older sibling Race, and with excellent components.  I may be in the minority here, but I also really like the sound of the dice cups.  Maybe I spent too many years playing Yahtzee in tents when I was a kid.  I thoroughly enjoy RftG's combos and variety of different approaches to building up an engine, then exploiting it for maximum points.  Super fun, and more thinky than most of my other fast-playing games.

I am very much looking forward to the expansion!

This is quite different from race, but I do kind of like it. We played two games back to back and in the first game there was very little in the way of strategy or control as we were all getting to grips with the mechanics, some of which are a little counter-intuitive, but the second game was much better as we all had an understanding of what we were doing and some of the familiar planning and second guessing what action your opponent might take from race for the galaxy came back to this dice version. Overall pretty happy with this one and I expect many more plays. 

I also really like the big chunky phase markers and I am thinking I might chuck raceFTG in with rollFTG and use the markers when playing both games.

This game is not a Race for the Galaxy killer for me.  Race is a more complex and varied game, a far deeper experience.  What I love about Roll is how it simplifies the game into a package that even families can have fun playing.  My kids love this game.  No question the game is still rich, and it has a lot of decisions.  Just not at the level that Race does.  While it does lift some mechanisms from Race, one of the coolest things about Roll is how it stands as a separate, distinctive game from Race.

JAN 2018: After years of Race for the Galaxy in my Top 3, when this went on sale, I decided to grab it for the variety. It went on sale and I scooped it up! The manipulation of dice, and the acquisition of dice do set it apart from RftG. Fun in its own way, but I do wish it had a different theme so that there wasn't so much overlap with RftG. I would like it more and play it more if that were the case, I suspect.

Ratings history: 10|8|8

[b]Fun re-imagination of Race for the Galaxy with dice-driven mechanics, but longer, more expensive, bigger-on-the-table, and not quite as fun for me. I won't buy this, but glad I can play it once in a while.[/b]

PROS:
- more cool art, good components
- the ways you can use your dice are interesting
- because of the tile-draw, lots of variability of play
CONS:
- pales a bit in comparison to older brother
- might be easier to learn, but still not super easy to learn
- dice can still screw ya!

In my opinion, simply not as fun as Race for the Galaxy with one expansion (which is comparable in cost).

This is definitely better than Race for the Galaxy, but that's not saying much.

I do like the dice and rolling them, but that's about where my enjoyment ends.

I like tableau builders, but maybe I don't like space themed ones.  Like Core Worlds, I don't feel like I'm 'building' anything.  I'm just rolling a die to get get more dice, to get more tiles, to activate others, etc. etc. etc., and I couldn't care less about the theme.

I'm not drawn in to the RftG theme, and that is a failure.

A fun game with the perfect level of strategy.  The first time I played, I found the rules EXTREMELY confusing.  Probably the most confused I'd ever been trying to learn a game other than Agricola (which I was inebriated when I was reading the directions, so I don't count it).  2 turns in, I still had no clue what was going on.  It finally started to click on turn 3 and I realized it was actually pretty simple to grasp.  And then I wound up winning soundly.  So if you're confused by it, don't be deterred.

If you love dice chucking this game is definitely for you! It comes with 111 multi-colored dice and variety of double sided tiles to develop your board that adds different power/abilities/dice. Very easy to store the components in the box and pretty fast setup for a game that has so many different dice and tiles. Fast paced game with simultaneous turn-taking and easy to learn the game. This game is very reliant on players being honest and trusting as the dice rolling and selection is done in secret, behind a player screen that everyone gets. The screen also provides information on the mechanics of the game and how stages are performed. There are many ways to negate the pure luck of dice rolling and there is a good amount of depth in the game. Once you understand how each stage is done and have a grasp of the what the different tiles do and offer, this game goes by very fast and has the perfect length between filler games and heavier euro games. Good game to add to the board game collection!

Need to play more to confirm my rating - could go up or down. 

It seems to push all the decision making into one part, where you secretly assign your dice.  But since you don't know what others will pick (or even what they *can* pick, because you don't know what they rolled), many of the decisions you agonize over could become completely useless since the phases didn't get picked by other people.

I enjoy games where you have to try to guess what others are picking while you pick them, but this one punishes you even more for guessing wrong, while simultaneously making it even harder for you to guess correctly since the dice, to certain extent, decide what you can choose.

I would like to try it again, but I wouldn't ever choose this over the original.

Ma sikerült kipróbálnom. Nem rossz. Nekem nagyon hasonlít a race for the galaxyra, ami akár pozitívum is lehetne, de a mértéke miatt azt mondanám, hogy nem venném meg mellé. Az kétségtelen nagy előnye a kártyáshoz képest, hogy nem kell ikontengereket megjegyezni, viszont cserébe nyelvfüggő.
Menete::
1. Dobsz egy rakat kockával.
2. Szétosztod őket az rftgnek megfelelően fázisokra, de csak egy olyat választhatsz, ami garantáltan végre lesz hajtva. A többinél bízol a többiekben.
3. Végrehajtjátok a kiválasztott fázisokat, amik kicsit mások:
- explore: felépíthető lapkákat (bolygók és fejlesztések) húzol egy zsákból
- bolygót építesz (ez kockák rápakolásával megy)
- fejlesztést építesz
- bolygóra termelsz
- bolygóról eladsz pontért vagy pénzért
4. visszavásárolod az elhasznált kockáidat pénzért. Ez érdekes mechanizmus, mert van olyan kör, hogy akár nyolc kockával is dobsz, de olyan is akad, hogy csak eggyel.

A felépített cuccok aztán új kockákat adnak, vagy kockaforgatási lehetőséget, vagy több pontot/pénzt az eladásokért stb.

I like the idea of rolling dice, I like how they are all thematically different. I like how planets give you more dice while developments give you game effects. All good there.

What doesn't work for me is marring all this with the mechanics from Race for the Galaxy. Rolling dice removes or greatly diminishes the amount of control the player has over his strategy when combined with that system. Hence the various ways to mitigate it: reassignment powers, dictate, etc. While they managed to correct that and it is possible to follow a general strategy, it also makes the game extremely fiddly. I would have preferred a streamlined system even if that meant severing the connection to the action selection in Race.

RATING: 6
Roll for the Galaxy is a very clever adaptation of the card game. In some ways it feels amazingly close to the original but there are certainly aspects in which both games differ. The dice version is not as interactive, and especially less strategic and more susceptible to lucky draws than its ancestor since the tile churn is much lower than the card churn in Race.

Even though Roll is a pleasant enough game I'm not sure why I would play the dice game in preference to the card game since both also take about the same time to finish.

Die haptische, heruntergedampfte Mini-Würfel-Variante von RACE als kalorienarme Coke Light. Für den eingefleischten Race-Core-Fan gibt es keinen Grund das leptosome Brüderchen dem mit Kartenzusatzstoffen gefütterten Originalstapel vorzuziehen. Für tendenzielle Bauchspieler wie mich, die sich mit dem Aufbau des galaktischen Engine-Imperiums eher schwer tun, ist ROLL das Spieleerlebnis, das RACE für den Harcorer ist. Der Perry-Rhodan-mässige visuelle SF-Ernst der erwachsenen Gestaltung wurde in die drollige Baby-Würfelei (Würfel verschluckbar) herübergebaeamt. Der duale Mensch besiedelt das All nun Hand in Hand mit ROLL und RACE. Obwohl ich seine Komponenten (Science Fiction, süße Würfen, schnelle Spielzeit) mag, werde ich mit dem beliebten Spiel unerklärlicherweise nicht warm.

RATING: 6
I've played 'Race' enough times to know that it's not really a game I want to pursue any further. Confusing iconography, awkward production/trade phases, and a game that rewards experience with bonus card combos means those who have played the game more will always crush those who have played it less while less-experienced players smell defeat about 10 minutes into it. I do like the spirit of Race and the impressive artwork, but that's about it.  I wanted to try Roll because (again) the spirit of Race is pretty awesome and I was hoping for a game that could capture the spirit but does it in a more straightforward way. I had no idea what to expect (or even if this was the goal of the designers).  What I found was a game almost completely devoid of that "spirit". It's quite MPS (with some indirect interaction) and not a very interesting solitaire game at that. Dice are generalized enough that you can pretty much do what you want without the dice getting in the way.  The designers clearly wanted to avoid the dice dictating your turn, so they went for a way to limit that feeling at the expense of the tension inherent in the core mechanic itself.  For a dice game I'm surprised by how irrelevant the dice felt by the end. Never did I feel like I had to make a crucial decision between one choice or the other. The game was all: build tiles, get some dice, roll some dice, build some more tiles, rush to the end of the game.  There are so many points in the tiles and it's pretty easy to build them that pursuing a produce/trade strategy seemed like a comparative time-waster to throwing everything into high-scoring tiles.  Even mining for the best tiles seems like a waste of time as my impression is working with that you got the first time around is slightly better than spending several turns hunting for better tiles. Certainly there are things to explore in the game for a group who loves it and yes there are ways to counter a player who is just dumping everything into colonize/research.  But for a first-time player and one who wants to be inspired to play more, 'Roll' comes off as fiddly, cumbersome, and for the most part, uninspired game.  My '6' rating is based on the fact that it is well-worked, unique as dice games go, and thoroughly designed. I try to rate games less on personal enjoyment and more on the craft of the game itself.  Plus, benefit of the doubt has to go to the fact that I have only played it once.  Lehmann and the Rio Grande team are no slouches when it comes to building something to its completion, and 'Roll' never comes off as half-baked or impractical. My guess is relative newcomer designer Huang did the majority of the design here and Lehmann simply lent his core ideas to the game.  This isn't to say that Huang's design comes off as amateurish (it doesn't) but rather that the game feels less aligned with what I feel most inspired "Race': The theme.  'Roll' literally gets buried under its mechanisms and feels a shade colder because of it.  Though I have never been a true fan of  'Race', I would rather play Race now that I've experienced both.  Honestly, I'd still rather play San Juan.

Wow, just wow. It is race for the galaxy but way better. Not so much looking for a good card going through tons of cards. 

Great dice mechanic with some luck but where you can influence the outcome and almost always to something great. 

Simultaneous actions makes it go quickly. Almost too quick...if there is one thing that would make it even better it would be if it would be a bit longer with another layer somehow. At least that is what I feel after playing it, but one can always play one more play.

INITIAL IMPRESSION
I enjoy this for playing with 3-5 people race for the galaxy type game.

The game plays out the same and does a good job of capturing the feel of the card game. I do wish some of the developments had different abilities than just rerolls but we will have to see what the expansions bring.

More chances to play RFTG is always a plus in my book


UPDATE
Great dice version of race for the galaxy. It's different in ways but the feel is very much the same. Many people prefer this game over race and I can see why. The game plays fast with simultaneous selection and is easier to get into than race. It also plays well with 2-5 where as race is more of a 2p and possibly 3p game.

The development abilities are more streamlined and simple. The worlds all do pretty much the same thing, give dice of a color + some bonus.

I haven't gotten the expansion yet but I know it will be a hit. Adds tons more starting variability with home worlds and new abilities. Also the multipurpose dice adds more control

I can't see ever getting rid of this game. Quite fun, easy to explain, enough luck & variability, and does not overstay it's welcome (like others of it's ilk).

I've played Race for the Galaxy 300+ times. For me, it's pretty clear that Race is better than Roll, especially for 2 players (the random roll for phase selection is kind of meh.) If you want something more casual, Roll might be the better choice. Roll certainly isn't bad and it's different enough to warrant owning both but for me it's just a good game that doesn't really live up to it's predecessor.

A clever dice game.  I had never played Race for the Galaxy, but my love for dice out-ways most card games which is what attracted me more so than the series.  Nicely balance mechanics, though still a little abstract for my preference.  Definitely on my radar.

Much easier to teach (and play) than its "Race" predecessor. Iconography is better and the game is overall friendlier toward people I typically play with. It also plays well with 5 players, which is a huge plus. And then there's dice!

One of my favorite games from the last few years. I much prefer this over the original Race. I'm a sucker for dice, but the different strategies are fun to pursue, and it's fun to observe your opponents and adapt to their strategies.
Played almost exclusively with the expansion, which adds variety without many extra rules.

Should play quickly, especially if players agree to play simultaneously after their selections.  Dice and tiles add chaos, and the only interaction is the guessing game aspect of selections.  Does a good job of tying itself to the original in a lighter way.  I would expect fans of the original to like it.

Lots of custom dice and cardboard.  Very streamlined feel. Similar, but thankfully different, decisions each turn from the original. The dice building aspect is a great compliment to the tableau building mechanic.

Smart and worthwhile use of the dice. Feels well developed and balanced. Will not sell RftG, but keep both. This is definitely the recommendation for anyone with neither.  A classic redone as another!

I very much like RaceftG and now Roll provides a similar game mechanism but much easier to get into (rules and iconography wise) with dice! And even though dice would normally mean "random", there are many ways to mitigate outcomes so this is not just "yahtzee" (looking at you D'Day Dice).

Interestingly I heard two players comment about the hidden nature of some of the very critical game play - each player manipulates dice behind a screen - so you need to play this with trusted players.

Very good components.

RATING: 9
Still working out the strategies for this one. The random tiles give a lot of potential depth. There's a bit of overhead learning symbols (though not as bad as its sister game Race for the Galaxy for that), and it can be a little too random. The dice mechanics are generally balanced though and they work well.

This game hits a lot of the same sweet spots as Race, but somehow feels like more work. I think it's because there are more currencies to deal with: instead of just cards, there are (a) tiles, (b) dice, and (c) money. You have to do different things to get each of those.

Still a good game, but hasn't summoned the magic that was in Race.

Wh...what did they do? Somehow, they took Race for the Galaxy, or rather, the core of what makes Race awesome, and made it WAAAAY more accessible to the casual gamer!
Even though the iconography is still there (if you're a Race player, this will be 2nd nature by now), but there are explanations right on the tiles! Explanations right on the player screens!
The components are all really nice, the art is beautiful, and the flow of the game is spectacular. Theme, is still a tad hit-or-miss, much like I feel about Race.
I feel this game will get played much more often though! Great job.

Dice version of Race for the Galaxy?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A streamlined version of the classic Race for the Galaxy. I think the dice made the game more understandable and more "fun", but there are a few shortcomings with regards to Race. First off, a lot of the time when picking a phase you are dictated by your roll. This is not necessarily a problem, but it eliminates a level of strategy compared to Race where it was possible to guess what your opponents would pick and play accordingly. Another problem is that the starting worlds are poorly balanced and some drawn tiles are strictly better than others. The unbalanced tiles/cards wasn't a problem in Race as they could be discarded, but in Roll it's harder to get rid of your tiles.

A small problem I had with Roll was also the plastic cups. It's nice to have bright colours, but the plastic makes far too much noise when rolling.

Adding a comment about differences from Race:
[q="GeorgW"]I'll chime in on the differences between Race and Roll. 

Race plays quicker (perhaps due to my group being more familiar with Race) and has a lot more strategy. While on the surface you make the same kind of choices in both games, such as which planets and developments to go for and which phase to choose, the dice in Roll screw up a lot of the depth in these choices that are still present in Race. 

For example when choosing a planet/development. At any given time in Race you have a hand of around 5 cards. This will of course vary, but in previous turns you've probably also chosen to discard cards that you've deemed to be worse than the cards you kept, so you throughout the game you generally have pretty good control of the cards in your hand. This means that if you play the game well and have reasonable luck, you'll usually be able to find planets and developments that have synergy and will help you win the game. In Roll, maybe you rolled 3 eyes so you looked at 3 tiles and chose 1. Maybe that tile is good for you, maybe not. That's the biggest flaw in Roll to me, because it almost eliminates the engine/tableau building aspect of the game.

A second example is picking which phase you want. In Race, that's a tense choice every turn where you're trying to predict what your opponents will do and balancing choosing something that's better for you or worse for your opponents. It's basically the entirety of Race's player interaction, but it's amazing. In roll, sometimes you roll 5 develops, so you choose develop. The randomness makes the prediction more difficult which in turn ruins the entire point of the mechanic.

With that said, there's still some stuff that Roll does better. It's a much newer game and as such has streamlined the rules a bit and is more colourful. It's also switched the phase sequence in order to make things move a little faster and allow for more explosive turns. 

As a summary, Race is the better game for me, but if you're new to both I'd recommend playing Roll first a few times until you're used to the iconography and flow of the game, then buy Race and never look back.[/q]

This is a slick design that presents the players with interesting tactical decisions. For me, though, it loses to Race for the Galaxy on almost every level. Roll is longer, less strategic, less interactive, more mechanical, and much more random (with the dice, yes, but especially with the tile draws).

Those who feel that Race for the Galaxy is too unapproachable, too unforgiving, or too cutthroat will probably prefer Roll for the Galaxy. It will also appeal to Feld-ian gamers who want each turn to be a little tactical optimization puzzle.

I like Race for the Galaxy; I LOVE Roll. Yes, there is a decent helping of luck because the game involves dice rolling, but the luck is within the players' control. Enough dice are included for every possible game situation, which shows the level of care Rio Grande put into producing this. This is one of my favorite games to play over the lunch hour.

UPDATE: Playing Roll brought me back to Race, and since paying Race again, I haven't played Roll.

Not as good as its older brother. Not by a long shot. Most notably because you see far fewer tiles in Roll than you do cards in Race. This severely limits your options. And, you lose out on the tough choice of deciding what to build/settle and what to discard to pay for them.

Still, there is much to enjoy here, especially if you are looking for a clever dice allocation game.

I'm in love with Roll for the Galaxy, just as I was with race. There is a lot of strategic depth that I feel is missing with most games that center around dice. My favorite thing about this one is the tiles themselves, being double sided, one side a planet, and the other a technology. Having this freedom to choose which side is incredible. I also feel like the 6 cost planets/tech, aren't used as heavily as in race, keeping the games a lot tighter. Awesome stuff!!

It is not a bad game, but clearly an effort to appease the simpletons that "hate" cards and love dice.  So we don't have cards; we have tiles . . .

The selection process is cool except for the 2 player version where an extra phase is rolled AFTER the selection.  This adds nothing to strategy and hurts it more than rolling before, or choosing twice.  Why would the 2 player version introduce a lock factor that ruins playing against your opponent?  I see all positive reviews of the 2 player advanced in Race, sad to see Roll doing the opposite.  

I am sure there is some simple house rules fixes, but I assume anyone that likes Roll better than Race isn't interested in having the best play win.

Not bad, but inferior to its parent game in every way, with more randomness and fewer choices. Also, it's harder to scan your tableau for applicable icons each phase, as they are all in the same area of the tiles.

The original card game version, Race for the Galaxy was ok but I didn't love it. However I do love this dice version.  It's difficult to pinpoint why, as mechanically they are similar, but I've enjoyed Roll so much I'll give it a try. 

Greater accessibility and little downtime:
Of all my games it's the game I've played the most. In part, because of the simultaneous player actions, it plays very quickly for a medium weight game. I can get at least a couple of games in a session. For a mid-weight game its rare that you get to give the same group a full game to learn and then a full-on more satisfying game in one evening. The quick turns also help new players stay engaged. 
Roll's greatest advantage over Race are that the card/tile powers are spelled out on the card/tile itself rather than relying on iconography. Not having to internalize iconography (like learning a new language) or refer to a overwhelming array of text on a  player aid (like looking up a dictionary) significantly lowers the bar for entry to this game. In Roll you and your opponents tiles and their powers are are always on display; static and easy to quickly view and understand. In Race the information you need to make decisions is more 'hidden' in terms of deciphering iconography but also just physically as your cards are in hand and must be constantly sifted through to see what they do. In short it's much quicker in Roll for the Galaxy to see what you have to play with and make decisions. Its also easier to teach. 

Theme and immersion:
Theme is highly important to my play experience. It makes teaching a game much easier if you can integrate a familiar narrative or theme that rationalizes/grounds the mechanics and immerses players. For instance explaining how the dice in Roll function I might start with- 
"These dice are your contractors for hire and will work in teams to complete projects for you. They come in various colours corresponding to their type of specialization. As individuals your contractors are able to do a variety of jobs but have preferences meaning they like and are better at certain jobs. But as any leader knows a team of individuals don't always do things the things the way you want. So at times you'll have to use your powers to dictate, coerce these dice 'teams' to do your bidding. When they've finished their work they usually 'retire' to the 'citizenry' to spend their hard earned cash. You'll have to pay for them to come out of retirement and reuse them." Managing teams of wayward space mercenaries-for-hire is probably more thematic and fun to explain than managing dice probabilities.

The great tactile elements of roll add to the theme in subtle but satisfying ways. The tumbling possibilities of every round takes off with the deafening rumble of dice being simultaneously rolled in upto 5 player's rocket shaped cups; simulating the roar, uncertainty and excitement felt watching a NASA rocket launch. Constantly moving the dice and tiles around, delving into the big black bag of tiles and shifting the player 'shields' really gets players interacting in the physical space of the game and immersed in their own little piece of this fantastic galaxy.

Almost everything I hate in a box. Fiddly tactical gameplay that sells depth down the river, slapping a half-life on your decisions the minute you make them, while embracing the stupid iconography and unnecessary complexity of Race. Most damningly of all, this game presents a lateral shift, keeping the same playtime while dumbing down everything that made Race special. Its reduced complexity does not reduce its duration. If anything, it makes it longer than its predecessor.

Race is good despite its iconography issues and solitaire aspects because it pairs fast play with surprising depth (though that depth isn't as considerable as Race's champions claim -- it's still a rather light game). Roll doubles down on those flaws and adds a few more.

Seems like a good game.  As usual, I'm not a big fan of dice games, but this one is kinda fun because there is strategy in using your dice well (and because you can effectively change a dice roll to a different side pretty easily).  I think I like this game better than Race for the Galaxy, which I rarely want to play any more after many sincere attempts to learn how to play it well.  Time will tell...

While this is multi-player solitaire with a bit of deducing what other players might do, the simultaneous nature of it all, its quick playing speed, as well as constant "clack-a-lack" sounds (which make RftG sound like it belongs in a retirement home, or a casino) make it rather enjoyable.

I also assume that there are various paths to victory that are probably well balanced through rigorous play-testing. While not my favorite kind of game, I think it has a lot of broad appeal.

Aesthetically, I wish that it were easier to read from across the table what it is that your opponents tiles do.

The quintessential dice-roller of my board game collection! The diverse starting factions and home worlds lead to a distinct experience every game! From the engine building to the clever dice mitigation, it surprised me how mechanically sound a dice-centric game could be. Roll for the Galaxy plays quick and is almost as quick to learn, thanks to the very helpful player screens and accessible symbology! This game single-handedly made me change my opinion on dice-based competitive board games! And sweet mother Mary do I love the sound of 10+ die rolling in a cup at once... It's so... beautiful...

I like a lot of games, and many leave me with that satisfactory feeling of accomplishment after finishing. But Roll for the Galaxy makes me actively happy (even giggly) *during* the game. I just like rolling those dice and making the best out of the result. Plus the light interaction, betting on other peoples phase selections, and the cool theme, make this a winner for me. Graphics and icons could be better, but well.

I feel like when you hear people say that this game replaces Race for the Galaxy, it is presumed that they are going around constantly trying to recruit people to play gamer games.  I hear the terms "more accessible" and "easier to teach" with Roll for the Galaxy, and, while I'm sure they apply, so what?  Does that make it a better game?  I think that it depends on what your goal is.  For me, Race for the Galaxy is one of the few games where once it ends, you say lets play again.  On the other hand for Roll, you say, that was kind of neat, what's next?

Dice pools instead of cards, driving acquisition of tiles and Galactic domination. I love the engine behind Race for the Galaxy (RftG), and this is SO close, but...  Roll for the Galaxy is a clever re-implementation of RftG, which changes the flavor of how cash is acquired/used, and the feel of the game, even though the end game conditions are almost identical.  Tiles give powers and or dice. Both are critical as players grow in ability to complete tiles and generate VPs.

For those who love dice rolling, the cups and the custom dice are fun to launch. For those who want their cash resources to remain constant on the other hand, getting used to dice management is different from hand management.

Roll never rated as highly as RftG with me personally, but it's a solid game in and of itself. 

Roll for the Galaxy seems to take a little longer to ramp up the motor to the end game, and at times one can be stuck with insufficient dice to have any positive choices.  Limited dice luck can play a large part in success vs. failure. (Dice HATE Me!)

As big a problem is the reduced flow of available builds- in RftG the Cards fly through, giving many opportunities to build or change strategy; Roll is not as fluid, and the number of tiles drawn much less than the the number of cards in Race, which limits overall choices.  Furthermore the stacking mechanism means it is more difficult to re-prioritize from less desired tiles if a good one comes in, which means luck of the draw bag comes into play. (Tiles HATE Me!)

Race for the Galaxy simply shines brighter as a game- in the end I decided to trade this because I'd rather play Race for the Galaxy.

Aspiring interstellar overlords commit handpicked citizens to a mind-warping battle school where they are... [i]changed[/i].  These agents are then dispatched on desperate missions across the cosmos—leading a surgical strike force of war-painted starships, or skin crawling with invisible tattoos that reconfigure into malware under certain wavelengths of light, or their skulls the vessels for a single dangerous idea.

Tomorrow, tomorrow belongs to the Ascendant—and there is no better way to leap for the brass ring than with a boot in your grasping rival's face.

[microbadge=26108]

[i]An unalloyed slam-dunk.[/i]  As a rabid [i]Race[/i] fan I am obviously predisposed to love this, but honestly, [i]Roll[/i] has far exceeded even my naturally high expectations.  Added to everything that's already fantastic about the Mother Game we have a gorgeous feast for the senses—the spray of color, the sound of the dice in the cups, the shaking and slamming, the digging around in that black bag for deliciously textured tiles.

It's a sci-fi jacuzzi with built-in mind-massage attachment.*

[size=7]*Pants optional (but not recommended).[/size]

[b]After 11 plays:[/b]  The response from newbs is overwhelming—all of them have found this far more accessible than [i]Race[/i] proper.  I believe it has to do with the fact that any given [i]Race[/i] game is completely hidden inside an opaque deck of cards, meaning that the game doesn't open up until you're familiar with the contents of that deck, and this requires either a bunch of boring study or many—[i]so many[/i]—crushing defeats.  With [i]Roll[/i], on the other hand, the dice give you a pretty big hint as to what's possible on your turn and so tend to drive play in more obvious directions right out of the gate.

Besides, fiddling around with the dice to "program" your turn feels like you're [i]actually doing something[/i] rather than just looking at a bunch of cards and having no real idea of what to do next.

P$.  They're not "dollars", goddammit—it's pronounced "galacticred" and each one respresents the economic output of an entire solar system across 31.5 megaseconds.

Includes:  [thing=175754]Ambition[/thing]

[size=7][b]A Very Important Note on Space Marine Recruitment:[/b]  As the recruitment protocols are a preëxisting component of the drinking water on most civilized worlds, the consumption of them constitutes retroactive consent.  This is only important for the recruit's relatives as the recruits themselves are neurologically predisposed to be "just fine" with the sudden change in life-trajectory.  [i]Oorah![/i][/size]

Race is the better game. Roll is the better experience. Dice are fun but their function as a way to limit your actions almost disappears entirely after 1 or 2 rounds. What you're left with is a mechanic that feels more like a selling point rather than a compelling obstacle. To get a bit more personal, the amount of plastic contained in this game is over-abundant. When you use less than half the components in every game, that's a poor product design (not poor game design). This game should have been an app. The reliance on gamer etiquette, superfluous upkeep, and plentiful component interaction are all things an app version shines at.

DICE GAME
Etter å ha sett litt flere anmeldelser og spill har jeg virkelig fått lyst til å prøve dette spillet. Virker raskt og har enkle regler samtidig som man må planlegge og ha en strategi. Alike vel har spillet lite interaksjon mellom spillerene utenom at man kan henge på hva den andre spilleren prioriterer som sin hoved-handling. Faller kanskje litt i samme kategori som Castles of Burgundy, men med helt andre spillemekanismer.
Kan virkelig være noe for oss hvis vi har lyst til å prøve et spill i denne kategorien.
Har også en utvidelse - Roll for the Galaxy: Ambition - som bl.a. innfører mål/oppdrag i tillegg til to nye kategorier av terninger og en hel del nye teknologi- og planet-kort.

Ordinarily not a fan of dice games, and I really like the original Race for the Galaxy, so I was highly skeptical of this.  However, I found that there are enough things you can do to mitigate the randomness of dice that I didn't feel totally at the mercy of probability.  The game is much, MUCH easier to teach than Race, because there's no need to memorize all the little symbols (most of which I found intuitive, but many others did not agree).  As a result, I feel like I can play this with new people and we can have one game in which they sort of learn and then immediately play a second game in which they understand what they're doing.  Race has a much steeper learning curve.  I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this one.

I won't go so far as to say this replaces Race for the Galaxy, but I do enjoy it a lot.  It keeps the tableau building aspect, but the engine building functions on the whims of rolled dice.  Lots and lots of dice.  You like rolling dice, don't you?

Instantly fell in love with this. Remarkably easy to understand all the things you can do, which is a considerable amount, and just works like a well-oiled machine. Glad I picked this up and hope it is well-supported with a good flow of expansions over the years. 

Has gone over well with everyone I've introduced it too and is so much easier to teach than Race for the Galaxy, its predecessor. I only wish it had as much, or more, content than Race. There has only been one expansion since it released and it's been quiet with no news of another in sight. Please don't let this one die, it's very highly ranked and sold well, I'm sure. I just want more tiles for the bag!!

Update - 8/28/17 - Still nothing has been announced since Ambition's release, which is a real shame, because I feel this game surpasses Race for the Galaxy, in terms of being more approachable to new gamers, since Race is much harder to explain and a more experienced player will trounce newbies. It irks me so much that the games I love don't get expansions(well more than 1), but this game has a good amount of replay just with the base and Ambition.

It's a very cool dice game. Dice have symbols that let you do different actions (six different types) and the different colored dice have different ratios of the symbols. Over the game, you'll be building an engine to acquire better dice and build tiles that will help you score points, money, or give you more flexibility placing dice.

...and then at the end of the game, you realize you might have just played the whole game completely absorbed in the game. There were four other people at the table too? Oh yeah, I guess there were.

While there are some subtleties where you don't want to have your nose completely buried behind your screen, the experience overall if quite solitaire. Like... the most solitaire board game I've ever played. It leaves me with some mixed feelings.

RATING: 7
For veteran Race players the essence of this game is the same as before, there are two strategies: the settlement rush and produce/ship. You choose one and hope to draw the tiles to match your strategy. Those same veterans will also find that more has changed than they might expect from reading the rules. On the one hand much has been simplified: there are no distinctions between production/windfall worlds or military/non-military worlds. On the other, there is even more luck. You may want to settle, but if you don't get the dice, you can't and for the same reason it's harder to 'leech' off another player's action choice. This strikes me as going in the wrong direction, there's little to distinguish one world from another, while many developments simply allow you to 'reassign', i.e. use a die for an action other than the one rolled. This makes the game feel both more bland and more random, not a great mixture. It also needs 3 players, I'm no fan of the 'roll a white die to choose a third phase' rule in the 2 player version, it introduces a chaos element that can decide a close game. This is the weakest game yet in the Race universe, that doesn't make it bad, just not as great as you might expect.

A friend broke this game for us. Focus on exploring and developing will win you the game by a large margin without much effort or clever play. Taking full advantage of shipping combos and perfect play is no match for this strategy.

I had never played Race for the Galaxy before purchasing this one, the iconography is what kept me away. I'm glad I got this one instead, it seems much more easy to learn but still has a lot of depth! I really enjoy the mechanics and how you can manipulate the dice.

This is such a fun game, it's the first game I decided to rate on BGG. I like the speed of play and the lack of downtime, but that's just a great streamlined mechanism. The play itself is so clever and the custom dice are work so well.

The learning curve is short, I feel a new player would pick up the rules in the first 4 rounds of play and begin to get a better feel for the strategies by the end of the first game.

I love Race for the Galaxy, but rarely play it as I'm always the one who can never remember what the symbols mean and I hold up the game. Within one play of Roll for the Galaxy I was slammin' and had a great time, and the player aid/screen was enough to get me by once i'd gone through the initial teach. I could focus more on the play/flow of the game (which is obviously simplified compared to the card game) and had a terrific experience. A great adapation.

Great game. Very fast and once you get over the hurdle of teaching people how phases work the game goes very quickly. I've taught it multiple times and everyone, EVERYONE I've shown it to has enjoyed it. None of them have played Race though so I can't really get their opinion on that. It might be bias having played Roll first but Race while fun, just wasn't as fun as roll (maybe it's the colorful dice). I'm not a huge fan of how Race puts producing after shipping although I would understand if you disagree. People argue roll is faster than race, I actually disagree if you have two people who know the cards. Roll is just better for me. Simple engine builder with lots of dice mitigation. I really want to try it with Ambition. 2017: 8.5


9.27.2017 Update: Holy smokes Batman. RftG + Ambition brings whole new life to this game. I want to just keep playing. This pushes it to a 9. RftG was getting stale  from seeing the same factions over and over but the new combinations are great. I would've loved to see more draw tiles but here's hoping for that in the next expansion: "Rivalry"

Man this is such a pile of crap. It is even worse than the original game. I am unsure how that was possible. Everything except for the components about this game sucks. There is a lot of luck involved. It is still demanding to make "best choices". You cannot really plan ahead because of bad luck though, and because of that it is monster AP. It is also monster AP because you have to play for every other player to see what they might pick on their dice. The combos are totally unbalanced so are the random starter sets - if bad luck strikes.

Broken. Bad. Crap.

The worst experience since long.

Super duper clashy, and many things are difficult to read, because they don't take into account the fonts against the backgrounds or the font sizes. It would be lower if not for all the tiny, pretty dice.

I enjoyed the game a lot, but I've only played once, and had only played Race- once before that. It was probably about a third way through before I picked up on the ins-and-outs, and further before I realized the kinds of things I should have done.

This is a great strategy game, but I'm the type of person who likes to announce to everyone at the table what I am doing on my turn and does'nt like non-turn based games because I always feel like someone or myself is playing wrong or is cheating without realizing it. It's also hard to keep track of what everyone is doing during the game and to correct others mistakes. Other than that small personal gripe this game is amazing with a lot of replay value. I would rate it higher if it weren't for simultaneous turns but that's just me.

Actually a reasonably smart adaption of the parent game (Race for the Galaxy) into a "dice" game.  However, it really did not scratch any itch for me that Race for the Galaxy did not already do.

I wouldn't turn down a game, but if given a choice between this and the parent game, I would likely pick Race for the Galaxy.

Played twice so far.  Seems like lots of possible combinations with worlds/developments.  game moves quickly with even with 5 players (very little down time) which is nice. But at the same time because it moves so quickly i wasn't really monitoring what other players were doing. interaction a little bit limited, and seems a little bit lucky with the dice rolls.  With 5 players the scores and rankings were almost completely reversed between the two games pointing to luck in rolling as a significant factor.  Still a fun game though.

More plays required to firm up my thoughts on this one.

July 2015:

Should play this a few more times, but I'm pretty sure it will cement itself as another 10.  I love that the dice planning is done simultaneously.

I don't feel like the feature space is quite as large as the card game, but it's pretty damn high.

I love how you need to get a feel for the tempo and understand the life-cycle of your dice.

Just a pile of interesting decisions thrown into a very tight window of time.

I chuckled at how many comments seem to love this simply for the multitude of dice.

Anyway, I have yet to play a game of this (about...7 by now?) where rushing any kind of tableau did not win. Dead serious. To the point where I do not believe anyone that says a full production strat is viable. Taking advantage of the strongest effects is nigh impossible if someone else is running and gunning, unless the dice decide to be merciful.

I don't give many games a 10 rating but this one deserves it. I usually enjoy card driven games more than dice but this one is so good that it's my current favourite. As others have mentioned bad rolls can be mitigated by the dictate power and world and development tiles. I find it extremely useful to stock up on a couple of these to give me more options.

Fantastic game. Highly recommended.

RATING: 7
A mildly entertaining, passable game. Unfortunately, I find that it lacks interesting decisions. The tiles you randomly draw pretty quickly determine what strategy you're going to use for the game (and there are really only two general strategies: build lots of developments and worlds or ship lots of goods), and for the rest of the game you're just thoughtlessly following that strategy. For me at least, there just aren't enough options. Every game seems to end up becoming a series of easy choices that have essentially already been made for you based on what tiles you happened to start with. This doesn't make for an exciting game, and often times the winner seems to be whoever starts with the best combo of tiles.

RATING: 8
Great game. Similar to Race for the Galaxy, of course. I like the dice optimization puzzle at the start of each turn. In exchange for that puzzle, I think it loses a bit of the reading-players aspect of Race. I enjoy playing both.

Turns can drag a bit when players Scout with multiple workers, even with players not prone to AP, just due to the physical tile-handling and the tile bag being a bottleneck.

RATING: 9
Roll. Them. DICE!

A great economic engine building game that uses dice as the pieces for that engine. The artwork and dice and tiles are incredibly aesthetically pleasing, but lying beneath the surface is a very quick, engaging and deceptively deep game experience. The use of dice to determine where workers will be placed in a given round is intuitive to grasp and great fun, but the kicker is that the luck of the dice is able to be mitigated by correctly anticipating how other players will be utilizing their own dice in constructing their engines. This is a great design, and a lot of fun to game around. Games are incredibly quick and competitive. The combos of tile layouts and strategies are quite diverse given how many different possibilities there are, and new, more efficient ways to victory are constantly emerging, making this game quite addicting in the best way. 

Full disclosure: I never win this game. Ever.

*Edit* I won!

Whoever saw Race for the Galaxy and thought: ''You know what this game needs to be better? Dice!'' ?

Why on earth ,replace the free phase selection of the first game with the dependence on dice rolling ?
Why remove the straightforward and quick phase selection with clunky dice that serve no purpose ?
Probably because it is 'cool' and it sells more than just the card game.
I see no reason why i would ever replace the card game with this one.

I bought the game because of the positive reviews and because  people said it was a gateway game to race for the galaxy. If I wanted a similar game I'd rather play Puerto Rico instead. Puerto Rico is easy to grasp, is deep, and feels more thematic without having to read so much card text.

I was very suprised when I first heard about this game, I thought that the original cards game was perfectly fine (except for one of the expansions). And then a friend told me that was a dice game and I was even more shocked, but the truth is that the game is amazing! It is really fun and the dice/workers mechanic works amaizingly! I am not a huge fan of games in which rolling dice is the core mechanic but, this one, is brilliant. It takes more or less the same time to play than the original, but even less complicated as you do not have to shuffle hundreds of cards. The cards have been replaced by tokens and all are kept in a bag, so shuffling is extremely easy.

Inferior to Race for the Galaxy in several ways.

Unintuitive and solitaire (one is too occupied with his own yard to be able to track the tiny abilities' descriptions in opponents' tableaux).  Maybe these impressions will dissolve with time, but they are off-putting enough during the first few tries.

Setting the above aside, the game seems pointless.  Yeah, you can play it, but why if you have RftG at your disposal?

I like the unique powers on the cards and trying to find ones that work together, but like in Race I feel like usually these decisions are pretty straightforward.

Excellent dice implementation of RftG.

My one thought so far is that I miss the card draw being the currency, in that in Race you can build an engine to draw lots of cards and then spend the cards that you don't want to build stuff, whereas in Roll you have to build the engine to get money instead, getting access to lots of tile options requires repeated exploring, which is slower and makes it harder to follow a streamlined strategy.

RATING: N/A
I want some time to put a number on this.  Race is a solid 8 for me - after two plays, this is deeper tactically, is easier to teach, and feels like it COULD be Race's strategic equal.  

I've got hundreds of plays of Race between FtF and online, and if this is better across the board, can I rate it less than a 9?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Roll for the Galaxy is much, much more accessible than its predecessor. The use of dice to limit action selections and mechanics that allow more "wagering" of which actions will be available each turn help simplify the decision process. Even with this loss of control, the game retains plenty of challenging planning and tactical decision-making. Seasoned veterans of Race for the Galaxy might not like these simplifications, but Roll for the Galaxy is the answer for those who have wanted to enjoy the original game but found it to have too steep of a learning and mastery curve.

Race vs Roll?
In Race, you see a BUNCH of cards throughout the game and can alter your strategy accordingly. In Roll, you don't see many tiles, so strategy isn't as important as just developing/settling what you have. Of course, the benefit Roll has is it's fun to play with dice. Both are fun, but I think I prefer Race.

Seems like every game is getting a "dice" version these days to bank off the corresponding board/card game's popularity.  In this case I think this actually takes a card game that requires repeated playing to just learn never mind how to be good at it and turned it into a game a lot easier to pick up.  Short play time also helps.  Obviously with any dice game luck of the rolls can help or hurt you....

Not much difference over original card game. Maybe a little more streamlined but still draggy, tedious, and boring like the original. Don't see the point of this version other than "it's new, it's new!!!"

Unlike other dice variants of beloved titles, this one doesn't bring anything new to the table. It's basically the same structure, just rolling dice. For example, I much prefer Nations dice game over the original Nations. Regardless, there is something that will appeal to different types of gamers with those two games. Not so with Roll/race for the Galaxy. It's basically the same game to me.

The dice and rubbery cups are fun. Not much else going for this. I don't want to play either version again.

Dice version of Race for the Galaxy. Works really well and it's always fun to roll dice.

While dice are involved there's a couple of ways to mitigate the rolls. You start with a power that lets you use a die to change the face of any other die and as the game progresses you can acquire more ways to manipulate the faces on your dice. So far I haven't felt as if the dice were ever really "screwing me over" in any games.

This game is new to me, so not sure if the review will hold up over time.  I love the fact that each turn is a mini-puzzle to solve with your worker selection and trying to anticipate what your opponents will do.  I still occasionally botch the economic aspect of this and get low on dice, but it is a pretty fun abstract empire building game.

I've definitely enjoyed my first couple of plays of 2 and 5 players.  Runs very smooth. Makes my head hurt a little less than Race for the Galaxy.  This hits a lot of my buttons with die rolling, interesting decisions, anticipating your opponents phase selections, and engine building.   I like how fast it can play 5 players with the simultaneous action.  I find myself comparing it some with Alien Frontiers which has a lot more direct interaction, but can take a long time to play with more players.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (February 2015)

For me, Race for the Galaxy is one of the best games ever made. Since the beginning, it had has a permanent spot in my Top Ten favorite games, so I had huge expectations from Roll for the Galaxy, after I played it, I have some mixed feelings for the game, but the overall feeling is that I like it.

If you are familiar with RFTG, the game explanation is a breeze and can be done under 5 minutes, if you have never played RFTG, it still seems the game is easier to teach than its parent game which is a huge plus. The art is very cool (identical to RFTG) and the playtime is around 1 hour but I think it can be reduced a lot by experienced players. The game offers interesting decisions (where to play my dice, should I dictate? Which die to use when doing X action, How many tiles to recycle when scouting, should I play a world or a development?) and the dice are good looking. 

Roll for the Galaxy comes with a great player aid and the components are of good quality. I find the iconography to be very intuitive but I also have the same feeling for its parent game and many friends disagree with me here :D.

The game flows easily, each turn players roll the dice in their cups and then they plan according to what they rolled. You can choose to play any phase with any dice but from that point onward the dice need to match the phase you want to play, so there is some luck in this, I’m still not sure how much the luck factor affects the game. Some dice are better to settle while others are better to develop etc. I really like that.

Bottom line, Roll for the Galaxy does have the same feeling that RFTG has. I feel a seasoned RFTG player has an advantage in this game as well. Most of my friends prefer this new implementation but for me and my girlfriend, it doesn’t even come close to replace RFTG. As it stands Roll for the Galaxy is a borderline 7.0 for me and with more plays its rating can go either way.  I’m still not sure how much the luck factor affects the game and I think Roll for the Galaxy requires less skill to play well. For now I will keep the game and I want to play it again soon.

Current Rating: 7.0

It plays differently as it scales since it's less important to predict what your opponents are doing because a full table of players will naturally allow more phases to occur each round.  It is very much a "heads-down on your own boards" experience, even though you care about what your opponents will do.  My only complaint beyond the necessary secret rolling an manipulation (just don't play with cheaters) is that the simultaneous play that is so great to keep the pace of the game quick makes it tough to appreciate what other players are building and if anyone is inadvertently playing a rule incorrectly.

Got it in Barnes & Noble clearance for $25.47 total. What a steal!

But I think this game is okay. I just wish it had player interaction. People will argue that it does, but only indirectly and even they will admit that it is very small. The player interaction has such a small footprint on this game, that it doesn't do enough for me.

Also engine building is my favorite mechanic and this doesn't do it for me because the process to build it is slow.

Limited player interaction and high luck factor (both in die rolls and tile draw) keep this game pretty shallow.  However between satisfying tactile experience, the odd times where player phase selections align or screw you, and joy of hitting a clutch roll, more fun than it should be.  From limited plays, seems like shipping at least a little is key to winning - no other strategy stands on its own so successfully.

I love rolling the dice and the flexibility I'm offered with placing the dice. Trying to guess at what other people are going to do is great and key to winning the game. There is no interaction with other players past choosing what action your going to trigger and guessing at your opponents choice. my wife's comment was that it felt like a solo game and although we all take points from the same pool she is right. But building your engine is fun and you do feel as though you are racing the other players to end the game first. I do like this game and find it relaxing. The game is colorful and the iconography is easy to follow. I'm keeping hold of this one :)

RATING: 6
Has a very similar feel to Race, but separating out the actions from the cards into separate entities (which is essentially what this game primarily does) makes the game a bit lighter strategically but also easier to learn and play. In the end, I gave up on Race because I didn't play it regularly and I tired of explaining the iconography and watching people struggle through it. I didn't hate the game, but didn't enjoy it enough to overcome this hurdle.

Roll struck me as particularly self-absorbed, more so than Race. Not only am I doing my own thing, I'm doing it behind a screen! Yeah, I should anticipate what actions others will pick and ride their choices to make more efficient use of my dice, but I don't know. I felt like I spent the whole game rolling and sorting dice behind my screen and then fiddling with my tableau. Felt a bit lonely.  Again, as with Race, I don't hate it - the dice play is quite clever, in fact - but there are many other games I'd rather be playing. I think I prefer games that have a shared play space. This game has none.

This is the only game I've played where I was tempted to say, "Ken, leave me alone! I'm trying to play a game with you!"

We love this game. It offers lots of interesting choices each round and I am always left wondering what the next interesting combination of tiles is going to offer. Component quality is nice and we love the huge pool of dice and the massive draw bag.

RATING: 7
Rating based on about 8-10 plays thus far.  Definitely prefer this to its progeny, Race for the Galaxy, as I think the game moves more quickly with the dice mechanism and then the simultaneous action selection (which can become a bit of a guessing), plus the help information behind the player screens eases the learning curve present in the iconography with Race that is a little easier with Roll, IMHO.  So, I would play this over its progeny any day.

My enjoyment of this game has grown with repeated plays.  One must chose the tiles they will develop and worlds to settle carefully.  Don't just settle on your draw.  You must make sure there is synergy between your worlds and your developments to build your engine.  Then comes the pivotal moment when you transition from building your engine to using your engine. Knowing when your engine is "good enough" is key.  The follow mechanic is a key nuance in this game.  You must not only have a good strategy, you must be able to read your opponent.  What action does he need to take?  Will he gamble that someone else will initiate it?  For example, is he willing to gamble on you initiating production so he can focus on shipping?  Although this incredible game is not very complex, it would not be recommended as a gateway game.

Roll for the Galaxy (骰越銀河)背負著Race for the Galaxy (銀河競逐)的盛名而發行，即使遊戲結構大同小異，仍然有銀河太空無限發展的趣味存在，我不認為Race會覆蓋Roll的光輝，雖然骰子的隨機尚在，但遊戲路線的變化性仍有相當的吸引力，55張不同的科技及星球也讓這個遊戲更加豐富，遊戲簡單好懂，我想不論是老玩家或是新朋友應該都會喜歡。

Great medium-light Dice Roller that doesn't rely on randomness for its thrills. Theme isn't as present as it could be but honestly it does better than I expected it would. Components are all high quality. A little hard to teach as the terminology can get in peoples way at first. Once they understand the basic mechanisms, though, it's actually a decent game for newer gamers.

I didn't have the best history with Race for the Galaxy... When I first played it, my wife wasn't a fan, which pretty well killed any chance to get deeper into it. And my subsequent plays were with a couple that had played it extensively. It was one of those games that really needs to be played with opponents of your own skill level, and unsurprisingly I was soundly thrashed as they were completing their tableaus as I was beginning to figure out how this whole production and shipping thing worked... Despite this, I was still remarkably interested in Roll for the Galaxy, and its roll selection (zing!) mechanics.

My interest was warranted as it turns out, I'm really quite enamoured with Roll for the Galaxy. While it seems as though it may lack the depth of its predecessor, there are still plenty of options to consider given that each of those numerous tiles is double sided, and can be placed as a development or planet. And the variety of starting tiles and homeworlds combinations give each game a little bit of different flavour, while providing you with an initial strategy to pursue. And I've seen a variety of successful strategies end up winning the game; whether it's a small tableau with a focus on consuming as quickly as possible, or a settlement strategy that attempts to pour planets into the tableau, it's nice to know that there's not one preferred way to win the game. It's satisfying to build your production engine, and when you factor in the the chance to read your opponents' minds and draft additional actions on your turn, it adds a nice deduction element as well.

There is a double dose of luck in the game however. Since it is a blind tile draw, there is always the chance that someone is going to stumble into pulling the exact tiles they need at the exact time they need them. In one game, I was fortunate enough to pull two 6+ development tiles. While it took a while to get both into my tableau, the points plus bonuses they provided helped me easily win the game by a significant margin. Meanwhile, my opponent was stuck pulling low to middling tiles that were providing him additional income, but little else. This is at least a little mitigated by the fact that you can choose the orientation of the tile and place it into the stack as a development or a planet, but the luck element is still there. And secondly, as expected with a game of this nature, the dice have a huge luck factor as well. I have had games where I have been absolutely unable to roll what I needed to progress my civilization. The Dictate action thankfully provides you the ability to reassign a die to whatever action you need, but you will still feel a little hamstrung when you need to assign multiple dice to an action to proceed with your strategy and are only able to commit one each turn. Mercifully, because this plays so quickly, your torture will be brief and it is remarkably easy to re-set and play another game.

As it stands, I haven't ever had a solitary game of Roll for the Galaxy; they always end in a rematch - which to me says a lot about the quality of this game. When your engine is just about to get humming, and someone pulls the last VP chip or throws out their twelfth tile and it comes crashing down, there's an immediate desire to run it all over again and see if you can do better. I can't predict how this game will age; there's a chance that the luck factors will become too burdensome over the course of multiple games. But as it stands right now, the brilliance of the other aspects more than make up for the shortcomings, and I am really looking forward to playing more.

RFTG is one of my favorite card games. Given this and the hype on release, Roll for the Galaxy was a disappointment on its first outing. Strategically, there’s nothing new to be found here although it’s as complex and deep as a dice game could get. The randomness of the cards was replaced with the randomness of the tile draws. In fact, it’s more random as less tiles are drawn. On top, the dice introduce more randomness. The mitigation mechanism of reallocating dice is a crutch. Handling many small dice behind a screen, attributing different symbols, reallocating them are all inelegant and intransparent mechanisms. I would play again but I see no reason to play this instead of the card game so far.

This game took everything about Race for the Galaxy and turned it into a dice game. The confusing symbology is mostly gone, which is perfect for newbies. I easily taught this to someone who had never played proper board games before, and she loved it. I have played this many, many times and I am sure that it will remain in my favourites for a long time.

Haven't decided if I like it better than Race for the Galaxy. It certainly feels quicker.  The only real slowdown was when several people were exploring, but even that seemed quicker than the card game. (I suspect, also, there's less looking ahead than typically done in the card game).

Still, feels a bit more on rails than Race.

Will need to play a few more times.  Think it might be a easier game to get out with more groups than Race though.

You'll just keep dumping all the coloured dice in your cup without much thought, most of the game. Dice are so easily manipulated and most of them have wild sides. I do love the concept and would be interested in engaging with it more however. But for now, it seems more of an exercise in timing rather than planning.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.3
I've played this over 100 times and I'm almost always itching for another game. Huge replayability. Some house rules I like.

-At the start, draw two of each starting tiles for your tableu and pick the combination you want.

-End the game after 18 tiles are placed and increase the victory point chip win condition to 18 VP chips per player in the game.

Some say that the randomness of dice rolling takes away from the strategy in the game. I couldn't disagree more. Unless you're playing a perfect information strategy game there will always be an element of randomness. In this game, the very large random element that dice present is mitigated by basically giving you one completely wild die each time (of your choosing), giving everyone an early game mechanism to change another die to anything you want, AND putting in MANY tiles and abilities that let you control die faces in very fun and interesting ways. If you have a cohesive and thought out strategy, it is viable and can lead to a win. Super well balanced. I feel like instead of coming out with an expansion to fix some problems with race for the galaxy, instead, they reinvented it and improved on things that were less than ideal in race. Brilliant execution.

wowowowoww this may be a contender for the best 2-player game I own so far, with patchwork just slightly ahead because of its' accessibility. It also scales really well. I love the simultaneous play aspect of the game, although the gameplay runs the risk of a multiplayer solitaire feel. I like but don't like that we base the game off the honor system. Its easy to accidentally knock a die over when moving pieces

I'm one of those players who prefer Roll over Race for the Galaxy. The dice mechanics are more elegant and I have consistently come up with strategies that actually worked out playing Roll while I am terribly bad at Race, because card games hate me.

However, I do understand that Race is not a bad game. I just prefer Roll for the Galaxy because I understood this game faster than Race for the Galaxy, which still makes me slow down and rethink my cards because it never seems to really click with me.

I guess having actual credits instead of discarding cards to pay for is the one huge difference for me. If Race had a similar mechanic instead of discarding cards... but I digress, wouldn't be the same game I suppose or unbalanced or whatever.

Love it, especially with the Expansion "Ambitions" which adds more layers to the overall strategies. Would roll with it anytime.

It takes a while to get people up and running but once they do this is a delightful game of rolling dice and exploring the galaxy!

The symbology is clear after a play or two and it seems they attempted to make it a bit easier to get into when compared to Race.

There may be a dominant strategy... but it doesn't really work in our meta of "rush to end the game. If I end the game before others can build big stuff or get their delivery engine running then I'll have won, right?" (spoiler, the meta doesn't work. But sometimes it does and thus those players feel justified xD).

This game is very cool. You have 111 customs dice that look gorgeous and colorful, you have a solid game that took 6 years to develop and you enjoy yourself when you roll the dice and try to come up with a plan for them. The game has luck but has enough things to mitigate bad rolls to the point that sometimes you have enough reassign powers that you roll the dice for procedure. The game is deep and setting your engine up requires good strategic and tactical decisions since you have to adapt to what you draw but ultimately have a goal because your tableau pushes you kinda in a direction. I really need to play this game more.

Love the theme and the fast gameplay. The action selection mechanism in this demands that you pay attention to what your opponents are trying to do. I really like this game at 3 players because it's easier to pay attention to the other players than at higher player counts. A players who can somewhat predict what phases are activated will be more efficient with the dice use. The simultaneous turns also makes the downtime in this game really low and so I always have no problem playing this with 4 or 5 players.

After several plays this one just never clicked. I always felt like the engine building was too gradual, and the game ends before it really gets running.

I traded it for Quantum, and I'm pretty sure both of us feel like we got the better deal.

Initial rating based on solitaire play to learn the game.  Seems easier and quicker to play than Race.  The unofficial solitaire variant is a good opponent.  Still very much like Race in that there isn't a lot of time to build a great engine, you need to monitor your opponent and modify your plans to stay competitive.  

The use of separate tiles for the developments and planets and dice for goods/workers relieves some of the decision making in Race about which cards to use as good or to pay for developments or planets is gone.  I like that change.  This seems like a really good mid-complexity Euro.  No direct interaction, but your actions and choices are definitely influenced by other players.

Often I like dice-handling games but this didn't sit well. I'm not sure whether it's too short for the degree of fiddliness of the rules (just too many dependencies on type, colour, placement, blah etc. of the dice), or too long (and fiddly) for something that is so luck-driven. If the engine was more intuitive and flowing I'd rate this significantly higher.

Picked up on a whim and my SO loves this game! Simple iconography and a whole lotta dice. She tends to love the dice versions of most games (see Pandemic: The Cure) and this one is no exception. This is our competitive version of PtC.

RATING: 7
Includes the Expansions:
Roll for the Galaxy: Ambition (2015)
Roll for the Galaxy: Terraforming Colony/Diversified Economy Promo Tile (2016)

Roll for the Galaxy is more streamlined and entertaining than Race, but it still fell flat with my group. I think we desire more player interaction. Still, I am not willing to give up on it, because I can see the potential. I am keeping it on my shelf, for now.

Sad to say I don't like this any better than Race for the Galaxy. The icons are just too confusing for me and thus I can't seem to develop a viable strategy at all. I'll play it with friends who like it, but I will just be going through the motions.

Kościana wersja Race for the Galaxy. Prostsza ale też wymagająca. Masa kości a mimo to nie bardziej losowa niż karciana wersja. Odpowiednio zarządzając zasobami (kościami) można znacznie ograniczyć i tą minimalną losowość. Ciekawym rozwiązaniem jest to że każdy losowany kafelek ma z jednej strony planetę a z drugiej technologię i samemu można wybrać co wyłożymy. Ci co lubią orginał twierdzą że prostsza i łatwiej nauczyć kogoś w to grać a potem łatwiej wprowadzić w karcianą. Ci co nie lubią często wolą i lubią tę wersję. Mieli mi dosłać z MW jedną brakującą kostkę a że nie wiadomo kiedy to będzie poprosiłem o wysyłkę - ok wysłali po 3tyg po ponownym przypomnieniu wraz z kafelkiem promocyjnym.

I like Race for the Galaxy. I like even more (waaay more) Roll. Yes Roll is easier and maybe a bit less deep thant his brother. But I like that since I can play with much more people around me. Also, for me, Roll has something else that Race has not. Can't say what it is, but I can say that the 111 dice are helping :D

While the idea might be great, the actual bidding and revealing of dice placing works ridiculously. Very steep learning curve, all those texts and planets and such, we were all gamers but just gave up on it. It took too long.

The dice chucking in this game is great. The randomness has been mitigated somewhat, though there is still a good amount of luck involved, not neccasarily a good thing. I find the game to be good, but never really excited to play. Space theme is not my thing though so this might play a roll. Would have been an 8 with a different theme.

It's fun to a seasoned RFTG player, a bit longer and the leeching-on-others'-actions -part suffers a bit from an extra luck factor, because the dice can dictate what others will choose and you'll have a harder time deducting it looking at their tableau.
Expansions later maybe? (And maybe they'll bring a bit of "interaction" as in Rebel vs. Imperium / The Brink of War)

Okay, so I played Race for the Galaxy long, long time ago and back then I did not like the experience (especially compared to San Juan). I had so many problems with it that ever since I did not even feel like giving it another try. Yes, I know it starts to shine after five or ten plays but... no, I did not feel like I want to experiment with it further. But as I like dice games I wanted to give Roll for the Galaxy a try.

I'm not even sure about all the details of the original rules anymore, but I do like many of the differences I noticed. First, the dice part - I think it's clever, allowing quite a bit of freedom but still randomizing your actual 'hand' you can do things with (also, feeling a bit like a deck builder where you choose which cards you want to draw from your deck). I also like that while seemingly the tiles offer fewer different actions than the cards did, what these tiles offer are clearly written on the tiles so even as a beginner I do not have to refer to the rulebook all the time. I like the two-sided tiles that make the possible "shuffling through the deck, looking for certain cards" part of the original just not work here. Also I think it was a wise thing to change the order of the actions this time (first produce, then ship) as otherwise this game would have lasted longer than necessary for a dice game.
So, all in all, I like this one and probably because of the dice I like it more than I liked San Juan. (I guess I'd even buy it if it were released in Hungarian, although the price is very high.) What's more, it might work as an icebreaker for me: now, after more than five years I'm thinking of giving Race for the Galaxy another try.

After a video review: Seems better than race for the galaxy because the iconography is better and the dice makes it easier to manage.

Else I disliked the original simultaneous role election in the original game. Here there is a similar mechanics, but guessing the action taken by other player is not that important.

Seems relatively complex, will have to ry it form myself. Not sure it can actually beat SAnjuan And Puerto Rico for me, but you never know.

I really did not enjoy my first two plays of this game. Although there is a substantial amount of luck mitigation mixed into the mechanics, I still felt like the game was playing me more than I was playing it. My biggest complaint, however, was the feeling of playing a solo game with 3 other people. There is some player interaction, but not enough for me to feel like I was actual playing the game with other people. I went into it really wanting to like this game, and it just fell flat for me and the rest of our gaming group.

Jeder würfelt geheim. Darf nun einen seiner Würfel, unabhängig was er anzeigt, auf eine Phase stellen, die auf jeden Fall gespielt wird. Die anderen Würfel kann man durch Fähigkeiten umarrangieren und darauf hoffen, dass andere Spieler, andere Phasen spielen. Nach dem aufdecken wird geschaut welche Pahsen in der Runde gespielt werden und diese dann abgehandelt... Neue Plättchen bekommen, Plättchen erforschen/besiedeln um somit neue Fähigkeiten und Siegpunkte zu bekommen oder Ressourcen generieren und diese dann mit Phase 5 zu Geld oder Siegpunkten zu machen.
Wenn man die Mechanik verstanden hat geht alles recht flott von der Hand und man kann sogar sich darauf konzentrieren was denn die anderen so tun um spekulieren zu können, welche Pahsen die spielen und ich nicht unbedingt triggern muss.

Die Würfelbecher sollten allerdings mit Flies modifiziert werden.

RATING: 7
I might bump this game up to an 8 eventually, but I've been saying that a lot with Euros and after repeated plays they just start feeling like the same old thing again. Roll is definitely a lot easier to learn than its predecessor, as all the effects are written out clearly besides the iconography. Also the guessing of what action your opponent is going to take felt a lot more important (whether it actually is or not) because you could have a lot of dice be not utilized if you e.g. roll a lot of settle symbols but choose the produce action hoping someone else chooses settle that turn so you can do both. The way you get your tiles to build is neat but I'm not sure if I like it more than Race's cards. I wish you could see more tiles per explore as unless you are willing to abandon previous ones you can only see one per turn, and trading goods no longer lets you see more cards. It's kind of cool how the tile queue works and the double sided nature of the tiles, but it seems to make getting specific tiles a lot harder. Also, playing expensive tiles seems a lot harder in Roll because you need to potentially lock multiple dice out of play for multiple turns to pay for the tile.

I seem to generally not like dice allocation games, but this one I didn't seem to really have a problem with and I actually kind of enjoyed working with what you have, as even if you made poor rolls you at least don't have to pay to return the dice back, and there's some neat management of how many dice you can afford to lock at a time to advance your production/development/settling versus actually needing something to keep your economy afloat for the next round.

Starting with two tiles with one of them being a double tile makes your starting stuff feel much more different than anyone else, and I think that is one thing that this game did much better than Race.

Overall I think I still like Race better, but I think they still feel different enough from each other, and if I could get this game in a trade I think it would be nice both as a spin off and as a way to help people learn to play Race.

Roll for the Galaxy takes the essence of Race for the Galaxy (one of my all-time favorite games), removes the huge learning/teaching hurdle, and adds similar-yet-new-and-fresh-enough mechanics to make it a unique, excellent experience.  Different enough to justify having both games, but due to the intuitiveness and ease of learning, it has all but replaced Race for the Galaxy, as far as games that actually hit the table go.

RATING: 8.5
Just learned this game yesterday.  It took about half of a game for me to understand the iconography.  Once I got it, I immediately wanted to play again.  After we played again I put it on my wishlist. 

I'm partial to dice and worker placement games.  This has a bit of both.  You are building your galaxy and want to do so quickly, but you must rely on the decisions other players make in the game in order for you to complete your tasks.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
My absolute favorite dice game, Roll for the Galaxy takes the concepts presented in Race and just does them way better. I love the way that each die is used as an action, but you have to cycle them fully back through. A lot of people underutilize the ability to put tiles back in the bag, something that addresses most peoples' major complaint about Race, because there's so much flexibility in the strategy you take. Ambition is a phenomenal expansion, adding two new dice types and objectives that can help steer you towards a strategy early on.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I was curious about Roll for the Galaxy since it was announced, but also wondering how it was going to improve on Race for the Galaxy.

I played it a couple of times at the con and it definitely has a cool "feel" to it. There's no doubt that rolling those dice or adding new dice to the cup is a lot more satisfying than drawing cards.

On the other hand, it feels a lot more speculative then Race for the Galaxy because you end up placing dice in actions that you hope other people will call. That didn't feel like a satisfying mechanic to me. I know it's somewhat present in Race, but in a much smaller way and you're not actually gambling with your resources (dice) like you are here.

In the end, it felt like a slower game than Race and didn't add anything past the dice novelty. I'd be sticking to Race in the future.

Really enjoy the flow of this game.  While there isn't any real player interaction, the turns are simultaneous so there is no waiting.  The real stand out point is the fact that even though it is a dice game, it is very much strategy as well.

Great variant of Race (for the Galaxy). Not suited for tournament play at all as manipulating dice behind a screen screams for cheating, but if played for fun, it definitely is fun. If I ever buy it, I replace the dice cups with leather ones as the plastic is way too noisy.

A medium weight game with universal appeal, lots and lots to explore, and beautiful components. It just feels *good* to play.

It replaced Race for me because it is far easier to teach, and the components have an immediate visceral appeal even to non-gamers. It has made many fans among my friend group, even among players who don't enjoy complicated space games, because they simply love the way it looks and feels to play.

It is debatable which game is better, but Race is probably a more intricate puzzle with more variety in engine building and draw variance instead of dice roll variance. (Race is just a pain to teach to people who are turned off by card games that appear complex.)

Birthday gift 2015. Traded (for Tzolkin) June 2016. Played it a few times 2 player. I like it well enough, but have the trouble that I would generally rather play Race for the Galaxy, a slightly odd bash on a game that really does quite well to recreate Race as a dice game. Add to that my wife's indifference to it and the one place it might find favor was in the game group (where some Race haters abide) but that attempt ended in miserable failure and an abandoned game. So it went to the trade pile.

I love Race for the Galaxy, so I had to give this a try. My wife and I played a couple times, and while I found it interesting, my wife just couldn't stand it for some odd reason. (She does like Race for the Galaxy, though.) I think she thought it was too random with all the dice - but also I think she has a negative bias towards dice in general. So now she refuses to play it. Bummer. :(

One of the best tableau building games.  It has a light space theme but works very well with the mechanics.  You are exploring, building developments, settling worlds, trading and consuming goods and producing new goods.  Cards function as money as well as having powers.  You have hard decisions on what to save and what to keep. 

The biggest issue are the iconography and the amount of time it takes for a new player to learn.  Once you know the icons well, the game plays in 30 minutes.  It is immense fun with experienced players.

RATING: 8
Rarely does a dice game implementation outshine the original, but this is one of those times.  The dice decisions and the guesswork of what the other players are going to choose for their action is more interesting.  It still has a little too steep of a learning curve for new players to even understand the mechanics of the game, let alone the strategies and tactics of it all.  The planning phase occurs simultaneously, so it supports 4-5 players surprisingly well.

This is much much easier to comprehend than Race but not because of the manual. 

Watched Miami dice and Gigalad9's walkthroughs. All is now clear.

Phases make sense, just a great implementation. Played solo 2 player game, its pretty easy to forget about the other dice rolled and look at the tiles and decide what they might do and where to go next.

Like this a lot.

SUSD review sold me on this. Random chance of dice rolls is supplemented by being able to change them for a cost of another die. The game is about as random as what cards you draw in the original, with you being able to figure out strategies to make due with what you get. Very neat and every new development/planet tile let's you use more dice, dice in a different way, easier costs to getting the dice back, etc. Even easier to teach than Race, and even better if they've played Race. Likely will never completely replace Race, but it's definitely targeted for a slightly less cerebral experience.

Bought off Amazon. The Guardtower was a full $60, and just wasn't wanting to spend extra $20 to support them.

Found this hard going untill i watched a playthrough on you tube - The art to this game is to explore or hope to explore to give you as much income each round to buy back your citizens - Now this game is excellent - very similar to the card version and you get to chuck dice :)
highly recommended to fans of the card game

Th only downer i have (like the card game) is its all about the 6 point development cards - get the right combo and your score is untouchable - can make for one sided games

Too many dice version adaptations are poorly implemented or seem like they have nothing in common with the parent game. This is not the case with RollFTG. The arcane iconography has stuck around, but now instead of cards you have varied custom dice. This, paired with other tweaks, has widened the appeal of the franchise. I think having dice, something tangible, in one's hand makes the game feel less abstract and easier to related to.

I love this game!  My current favorite dice game.  We will see if it is just a reaction to "the new hotness."  The game may have limited amounts of player interaction, but the interaction it does offer is brilliant.  It will take a new player about one game to figure out what is going on.  I have introduced this game twice.  Each time after the first game I was asked to play the game again.  I find this to be the calling card for a fantastic game.  If you know how to play and are "the teacher" in your group, you may want to sit out and coach the other players during a learning game.

RATING: 8
The news of a reimplementation of one of my favorites as a a dice game initially did not make me sit up and take notice – I don’t feel that I’m anywhere close to exhausting its depth or appeal even after a couple hundred games, and retooling a game to dice usually means simplifying it considerably.

The early comments here on BGG were a first hint that I might be wrong about this, reading the rules strengthened that feeling, and finally playing it convinced that Roll for the Galaxy is a very good game in its own right. While it does not allow for as much strategic planning as Race (and the constant decisions connected to your strategy: what card to play, what to save for later, and which ones to pay for the useful ones), it compensates for that with delicious tactical puzzles posed by your dice. Apart from the ingenious rework of the turn structure, keeping intact all the risks and rewards of leeching from the other players, there are lots of smart little decisions that create both smooth gameplay and a vast decision space. The two-sided Dev/Planet tiles with their balanced sum of cost and the build stack are examples of this.

All in all, I’d recommend giving this one a try to every fan of RaceftG. One caveat: I can’t properly judge how accessible this game will be to anybody not acquainted with the original, but I can’t believe that it will be an easy ride.

I'm a bit of a sucker for dice games and this is easily one of the best.  It plays quickly and makes you want to play again immediately.  There's actually quite a bit to think about as you play - beyond just calculating probabilities.  I love how the different colored dice are specialized in different areas and help shape your strategy.  The tiles add a lot of variety to the game.  

So good, in fact, I'm starting to consider how many of my old dice games need to find a new home.

Updated after 48 plays (from 8.5 to 10): A game is truly special when it makes you fall in love with it again and again.  So many games are good to great for a handful of plays, but then my interest falls off.  Roll is one of those games that just keeps growing on me.

This can be a tough game to teach. While the general consensus is that this game is easier to get into than the card game version, I've found there are a few concepts which are difficult for the first time player to grok. I think the best way to play this game is to get in 2 to 3 back-to-back plays in an evening. There are so many combinations and strategic paths to explore and it has a learning curve before the mechanics click into place. This is a solid design and I look forward to many more plays in the future. I believe this game plays best as a 2 or 3 player game.

I tried Race for the Galaxy on the computer and just could not get into it. Something just didn't sit right for me and I always ended attempting the military route as I understood that better. The consumption and then production ordered may have fubared my enjoyment of the game but I only started to realise this once I started playing Roll for the Galaxy.

This is a great quick game with a lot of depth and variability from game to game. The produce consume actions have been reversed from Race for the Galaxy and seem to me to make more sense this way around. The game flows wonderfully and is very quick. Which for me is fantastic as I like quick games with a lot of depth (Arboretum I am looking at you!).

I haven't got the expansion yet for two reasons. Firstly I haven't felt any where near like having played out the base game, every game still feels like it brings something new to the experience from the combinations of planets/developments I inefficiently select! Secondly I felt it was slightly overpriced and will definately jump on it if it appears cheaper anywhere. Hey like time, money is a limited resource for me!

Just a great game and one I will keep for a long while yet.

Okay, I'll admit it... I have a dice fetish... so there. After having previously played the Race for the Galaxy card game version, my interest was piqued when this game was announced.

This is not nearly as good as race because you have so little control over what developments and worlds you get. Phase selection is more interesting but it just feels like you make whatever you have too much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This one was a surprise for me.

While I understand the mechanics and subtle nuances with Race for the Galaxy, I've always found Race to be strictly a two player game.  With the numerous icons and heavy decision making, all it takes is one player or two players to take their sweet time to ruin Race's fast paced gameplay hence the preference for a two player as opposed to a 3 or 4 player experience.  The problems with Race is further compounded by the steep difficulty curve with the various symbols to understand and interpret for a new player

Roll for the Galaxy fixes many of the issues I've had with Race while maintaining the engine building and puzzle solving of the original daddy.  While completing a game can take a bit longer than regular Race, I'm willing to accept a longer game if it's easier to teach and less AP-prone.

Gone are the awkward icons replaced with text at the bottom.  Furthermore, each development and world do only ONE thing, as opposed to several things at once.  Planets will always give you a die, while Developments gives you a new ability to work with your engine building.  Another major improvement is that all tiles, which replace the cards, are double sided.  One side is always a Planet and the other side is a Development.  This means whenever you draw tiles, you can always get something useful.  If you don't like your tiles, you can exchange existing tiles you own with tiles in the bag, thus giving you some form of mitigation.

Another improvement is paying for things.  Instead of using cards in your hand, you get "space bucks" that allow you to buy discarded dice back into your cup to use for the next turn.  This eliminates a potential AP behavior of deciding which cards to discard and simply have the player buy whatever dice they need.  Sure, it removes much of the depth of the game, but it also makes the game faster and more enjoyable for everyone at the table.  

There are more things I like about this game but those are the major highlights for me.  To me, this is one of the best engine builders out there that I prefer more than the original Race for the Galaxy or behemoths like Terraforming Mars.  There is some player interaction in here, but they are subtle like a game of Gin Rummy as opposed to in-your-face interaction like Blood Rage or Kemet.  Definitely one of the bigger highlights in 2017 for me.

A perfect example of a game with relatively simple/streamlined rules but offers a good amount of depth and variation by offering a diverse set of tiles. Of course, the interactions among the tiles is quite robust as well. Overall, the components are solid, although I can't overlook that the player boards are paper rather than cardboard. I also don't like that the dice are screen-printed and many are off-center. The gameplay is smooth and turns go by quickly. I like it quite a bit, and I have never played RFTG. I think it's a little heavier than what it's listed at. It's definitely not a gateway, and I'm not sure it's even a "next step" game, but for any seasoned gamer, this is a great one.

After one play: Nice mix of dice pool management and tableau building. Rulebook makes the game seem more complex than it is, though some elements are counter-intuitive. Simultaneous hidden phase selection is vaguely Glass Road-esque. Colour blindness is not an issue with this game, thankfully.

Multiple plays later - fast, short, addictive. Easy when you know how and not too bad to teach after all. The terminology gets in the way a bit, but otherwise I am loving this as a thinky filler game.

Oddly I always get this weird niggle like I am playing this game wrong, but I am yet to work out why. It's like I always feel I'm missing something, despite generally doing very well.

Bought at Kingslayer Comics 8/1/16 using MTG Store Credit.

It doesn't feel like there are as many viable strategies as Race.  In Race, there are more cards that make alternative strategies like mass developments more viable.  In Roll, you NEED to trade to consistently be able to buy back your dice.  Overall, there's just something... "meh" about it whenever we finish a game.  It's solid, but not quite up to par with the rest of the collection.

Explore feels a bit fiddly, and I can see it taking a good long while in a 4 player game.

Pros:

--Beautiful components. The gorgeous tiles make building your tableau a joy.

--Simultaneous action resolution. Keeping downtime low increases the fun factor immensely.

--Multiple, engaging strategies without being too mathy. 

--Luck mitigation. While it's a dice game, there a million ways to alter your dice and reduce your bad luck - in fact, doing so is the chief tactical component of the game.

--That addictive magical something that keeps you coming back for one more turn or one more game.

Cons:

--A bit more of a non-intuitive learning curve than most light games have - while it's a reasonably light game, it's not a gateway game.

--Some strategies seem a bit better than others - it seems generally easier to win through building developments than by consuming goods.

Très bien mais sensations trop proches de RFTG (doublon). Qu'apporte t'il réellement ? Le système de dés complexifie et densifie la phase de choix d'action au détriment de la gestion d'une main de cartes (plus tactique, moins stratégique ? et encore). Moins immersif car nez dans les dés plutôt que dans les cartes.

I like dice, I like tableau building and I like space. I had some problems with Race for the Galaxy, but I should try that one a few more times now I know I really like Roll.

Right now it looks like I like Roll better: clearer iconography and sleeker design. 

The few games with my wife made it better: it's a step up from 7 Wonders and now with dice and tiles. She also really likes it: 'I want revenge!' She said it was the best game I introduced her to since 7 Wonders.

Edit: played it a lot more: it's fast in setup, it feels good to play this game (I like the use of the dice in this game). And above all: another game my wife will play. :)

RATING: 8
Updated from a 9 to an 8. Great concept, and I really do like the game, but it is chancier than I expected, and the Production/Shipping strategy is totally underpowered and leaves you deprived of money (aka, useable dice!), so you pretty much HAVE to do the "rush tiles as fast and high-point as possible" strategy which relies on the chance of exploring the right tiles from the bag and getting great rolls from the dice....

Despite these problems, it is really very fun and tense, and I do understand the hype.

Didn't like this at first. Played again after a two-year hiatus and enjoyed it more. The rules are actually very simple and there is some intrigue in predicting what phase the other players will select. Being able to play a game in 35-45 minutes is also a huge plus for our group.

I want to like this game, I really do. I just can't. The dice mechanic is actually really cool, but I think the thing that kills it for me is that your dice are semi-random and then whether or not some of them are even useful this turn depends on what other people are choosing. I wasn't really a fan of Race for the Galaxy initially (I'm starting to warm up to it) but Roll just adds RNG to something I'm already iffy on.

Same screwy iconography of Race, but at least there are more writen descriptions on the cards themselves.  Generally speaking I like it.  Not sure if it would take the place of Race but only time will tell - OK, I have to revise, the more I play this the more I like it.  It can slow down the game when you introduce new players but overall the pacing is good.  I would say I like this more than Race at this point

Decent dice game.  If you know Race for the Galaxy, learning this is easy, although initially the dice placement feels a bit wonky.  I like how it handles the number of dice you get to roll.  game plays too quickly, however, and I don';t get much of a feel of doing anything or accomplishing much, just racing to roll enough symbols to build enough stuff to score points.  Still, as far as a dice game goes it is ok.  Still irritating in how you have no way to interfere with the other players.

We just started playing this game, but it is challenging to get your dice moving in the direction you need them to go. A typical game lasts about 45 min to an hour, but we started to get the hang of it after a few go 'rounds. Really love this game along side Tiny Epic Galaxies. They're both different in their own right - but Roll for the Galaxy is a much larger experience. A lot more pieces in play - a lot more strategy - a lot more stuff to look at, consider, and keep an eye on. Very glad we made the purchase and we are happy this is in our library!

This is Euro disguised as a dice rolling game. Although rolling dice is the central mechanic, the game has that solitaire play style where the only interaction is guessing what other people will choose as their main action, letting you ride on it. Still quite fun and it's about efficiency to get the most VP points or race to 12 planets/techs.

I certainly liked some of the mechanisms included in this game but for my taste there were too many possibilities for mistakes and because you play behind a screen it can go without noticing.

After several less convincing reviews I was very surprised to like this. It seemed at first that rolling dice and then selecting actions is pretty stupid. Turns out that picking the number of dice for each action is pretty cool. Also, if you activate an action and place a lot of dice below then others may participate, but they will not get the same payoff (unless they also placed lots of dice, which is risky without activation).

The number of different tiles (planets/techs) seemed sufficient, even without the expansion.

The custom dice are of course very neat.

Played first time with 5 players.  After that full game played, I'm STILL not close to 100% on the rules of the game.  This isn't the kind of game you can just pop out, briefly explain and then play through (Imagine showing a chess board to someone for the first time, explaining how the pieces move and then jump right into a game...ouch).  If I had to describe it, I'd say it's like Twilight Imperium with no combat.  There didn't seem to be really any player interaction.  You're just stuck behind your little screen with your little dice, min-maxing your way along.  Maybe if I play again, after reading the rules, then I'll enjoy it, but so far?  Nope.

I was really impressed with this. Most dice versions of fuller games fail miserably. The good ones manage to distill the action down to a few basics. This one, however, invents a new game but feels incredibly faithful to the original. Managing your dice pool in all its forms and colors adds new dimensions to the game. It's worth a try for Race fans. Non-fans may still like it, but haters won't.

Like it but it's tough to learn if others already know the game well. You have no time to ponder and sort out a strategy, given the simultaneous nature of the game. Everyone sits around and waits for you. I've felt so rushed to play, a couple of times I just did whatever, which is effectively passing a turn (and you won't win that way). It is quite fun, however, playing with folks who move at your current speed, especially with Ambition tossed in. But to get better at it, you must play with others that are at your level or study the thing on your own time.

Surprisingly good dice game. I like exploring worlds and researching tech to build the dice pool and make interesting combo's of special benefits. The action selection with the dice offers enough possibilities to mitigate a bad dice roll. Shipping for money or points gives a nice tension to the game. Components are great also, I really like the little coulored dice and the tiles are nice and thick. Dont care for the artwork though, but it is not that bad that it bugs me. Overal very good dice game that doesn't feel that random and offers interesting choices.

I thought that this would be easier than Race and it was but not as much as I was expecting.  When I went to explain it, it was as complex to explain as Race was.  

It's definitely a lot of fun with dice chucking instead of cards.  It seems to go faster since everyone is in charge of their own stuff in terms of phases so there's no waiting around.  I seem to have waited more when playing Race.

This is an excellent reimagining of Race For The Galaxy. I don't feel like the game is "better" than Race as it's really its own thing. In any case, it's an extremely well-done and engaging mapping of some of the core Race concepts onto a different style of game. In fact, the game feels quite unique. The combination of role selection and worker assignment works great. I also like how there's an element of building up your work force (dice/pool building) alongside the usual Race-style special powers for building up your tableau.

All in all, an impressive piece of game design. My compliments to Wei-Hwa Huang and Tom Lehmann.

Simple, easy to learn, satisfying individual-competive gameplay without it getting too aggressive, and plenty of colorful dice. The turn rounds play quickly without the drag of AP from my other more complex games. The only con I have to share would be the lack of player interaction; it feels a bit too much like solitaire. So at the gain of being non-combative, and even though there is no race for time, it's very easy to tune out the other player and to quickly move through the game rounds since you both play at the same time.

RATING: 8
Has obvious similarities to Race, but feels different enough to warrant owning and playing both. A few differences:

- In Race you're seeing loads of cards and deciding which to play and which to sacrifice. That doesn't happen in Roll. Instead, you draw double-sided tiles (Worlds/Developments); when you explore, you may discard X tiles, then draw (and keep!) X+1 tiles.

- Consume happens after Produce. This is significant.

- No icons to memorize.

Overall, Roll is more beginner-friendly. The randomness of the dice rolls isn't too bad because there are ways to mitigate it. 

Plus, you get roll cupfuls of dice and slam them on the table, so that's good.

Given its Race for the Galaxy roots it was certain I would enjoy this and I do, but without finding it as addictive as the parent game.

The Ambition expansion adds some nice extra features particularly the goals. [12 plays]

Wow, I really like this game! We had to think a little about our first turns on how everything works but after that you really get intrigued by how you can manipulate the dice, getting them from your citizenry into your cup and on the board. I personally like it more than the card game at the moment - at least it's easier to get a grasp on the game than the card game and it has dice - a lot of dice! Would love to play ANYtime. Not much downtime either with more people as everyone plays simultaneously. The dice mostly add randomness but don't make it a luck-fest as you can always select the phase that you want and with the dictate action, you can re-arrange another die, not including the re-arrangements from cards in your empire. 45-60 minutes is easily within reach for most people. The Ambition expansion is also interesting to add to the base game, adding orange and black dice. We haven't played with the ambition tiles yet though. Try to fit all components in expansion box.

I liked it but I didn't feel in LOVE at first play...
My main "problem" with the game is one that I had anticipated before, the rolling and assigning the dice in secret... for me it takes a bit of the enjoyment I get from games, I like to see people making their decisions and thinking along and in this game that just isn't possible.

Also, the possibility of making mistakes during this phase is real and those can only be caught in the next phase and by then it will be impossible to correct them without the secrecy of that phase and what all players have done being compromised...

I also don't usually enjoy games where everyone does everything at the same time, like I said, I like to see the game evolve and see how others think and plan their moves, and once again here this can happen and it's encouraged by the rules and I don't like that... and when I play I'll do the the actions by faction tile order, I know the game will be longer but that's the way I like to play games... if it's to be playing by myself I'll just turn on my xbox...

Despite all that, I liked the game so, there's a good chance I'll like it more with more plays

EDIT:
Played it a few more times and I LOVE IT!!!!

 picked this up at Cancon, it wasn't cheap even with the 20 per cent convention discount, but it was probably the best price I was going to get it for given its weight for shipping (those 111 bespoke dice would incur significant shipping charges) and the shoddy state of the Australia Dollar.

Anyway, got it played for the first time during a Chinese New Year gaming session and I was not disappointed. The game plays very well and was something of a hit with gamer friends who dislike Race for the Galaxy (usually because of the iconography).

This game is a keeper and one that I am sure will see a lot of use in the future.

The box is a bit large and the now-discarded insert a bit worthless, but I hope the over-large box size is intentional to hold future expansions.

Very happy with this game!

Feels like a slight improvement over Race for the Galaxy. More streamlined, more ways to mitigate crummy draws, due to each tile having two sides, and the fact that the explore action lets you chuck unwanted tiles to draw extra tiles. Still, I never was a big fan of Race for the Galaxy. Both are okay games, but I just don't get what the hype is all about, even after numerous plays of both games. It's fun to try to craft a strategy out of the cards/tiles you draw, but I get bored with doing that after a couple plays. Also, it just feels like the winner is the one who got better tiles. Yes, there is a fair amount of skill involved in deciding how to play the tiles you got, but among equally skilled players, it ends up just being a crap shoot. And it's not at all uncommon for a lesser skilled player such as myself to draw a great set of tiles that basically drops a winning strategy right in their lap. That's just a tad more randomness than I tend to enjoy. It's fun for a couple/few occasional plays, then I'm done with it.

Having a blast with this game so far. I don't recommend playing this game with impatient people (they'll complete all five phases ASAP without waiting for others along the way). It's also exhausting to explain this game the first time; I haven't found a good way to go through all of the info. The game is very relaxing and has a cool space theme.
Update: My issue with this game is that people will do all 5 of their phases on their own. There is SOOO little player interaction that it feels basically like solitare. Guessing which phase other players are going to activate is like the only interaction there is.

Very good take on the original card version. It feels like it manages to reach the same depth than it's older brother with a lot smaller learning curve. Also, I think they did great with the action selection system in this game - it is a lot simpler for a new player try to guess what actions other players might be choosing. The use of dice in this game does not feel bad because you can affect the outcome by choosing different colored dice to your cup. 

The one downside I found in this game is that the starting tiles seem to affect your choice of strategy a lot. Some players might like this but I personally want to be more crafty during the game. But overall, a great game and would definitely play again when possible.

I love Race For The Galaxy, but the iconography was a hurdle for non-repeated play with the miss, making it harder to get to the table. Roll fixes this with the text on the tiles, and the dice mechanics is fun, luck while present is mitigated by the reassignment developments. Plays quick, easy to grasp thanks to text, this replaced Race for me.

RATING: 9.25
Once I read the instructions, I knew this was right up my alley: I love Race for the Galaxy, and I really enjoy games that use dice in interesting ways (like Macao and Seasons). Sure enough, I really enjoyed it.  It doesn't have the learning curve of Race (due to the iconography), but it still feels somewhat similar.

In reading others' comments about the game, I get the sense that I (and my wife) find it a bit heavier than most. Once we have a couple of reassign powers developed, deciding which dice to reassign is not always obvious and it can take us a little time to figure out the best move. But I enjoy that -- I was afraid that the game would require too little thought for my tastes, and that's definitely not the case. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.3
Wow! Once you have mastered the various actions and then this really streamlines the Roll for the Galaxy card game. The random tile (world) draw from a bag works well and the dice placement rules mean that you can offset the luck element of rolling badly. It plays quickly (as it should) and for a dice game delivers a surprising amount of strategy.
The more I play this the better this game gets. With players who know what they are doing the game absolutely flies along.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Better than Race for the Galaxy.  Easier to understand, because there are less icons used, and most of the ones that are used have textual descriptions either on the tiles or your player board.  The thematic integration feels better by using the dice (instead of cards in Race) as workers and resources on the tile developments and worlds you've built/settled.  And the dice rolling is fun, since there is always something interesting/good to do with your dice roll.  Total surprise for me.  Will probably purchase.

Not quite as enamored with this game after repeated plays. The dice mechanism, while very innovative and interesting at how you are able to mitigate your dice rolls, wears off on its flashiness pretty quickly.

This is really only a better option if you want to play with more than 2 or 3 people, and even then I'd probably still pull out Puerto Rico over this.

Very hard to grasp the concept of the game, I don't think I've ever had to explain so much before we get the game started.

But once it clicked - it was very straightforward to see how the game moved. Very streamlined and not very luck dependant at all. I initially thought it would be weird to use dice if there is so much luck mitigation, but it doesn't feel that way and works very well. You can still have the odd dice that doesn't fit into your plans but not enough to punish you for having it.

RATING: 9
In the dice version of this game, players roll dice to determine their actions. The dice have the symbols to explore, develop, settle, produce and ship. Different colored dice have more of a certain attribute. You slect a role you want, and you are allowed one non matching dice symbol to be assigned to that role, and further you may "dictate" a futher dice, so you could get 3 dice for that action. 

Instead of cards, the game uses 2 sided tiles which are either settle planets or develpments on either side and you set into your mat to construct.  The shipping action (trade or consume) is moved last into the phase unlike the main game, and when you trade, you use a marker to track the money, rather than use cards in the original game. You then use your money to buy your available dice to use. 

I really like this game. It reminds me of the fun I had when the orginal game came out. You want to get familiar with all the tiles and there are different strategies to pursue. There are 9 starting tiles and 9 double tiles that are dealt out, so you have a wide variety of combinations of starting home worlds. It's clean, and games do clock in at 45 minutes once you get used to the system. I want to get in a ton more games to look at all the tiles.

Race for the Galaxy redone: not a new game per se. Overall there is fun aspects from the original, but the new 'improvements' are not great. It is worth a little extra time investment in the original. 

PROS:
-Game is promoted as a more streamlined than the original. It is, but definitely not significantly so. 
-Windfall planets are removed, which is ok (windfall was an extra layer of complexity). 

CONS:
-Consume has been replaced with ship, which I would argue is more complicated (also convoluted). 
-The option to explore for 5 cards (now tiles) and keep one is no longer available, which is bad; limits combinations and introduces more luck of the draw. 
-The dice dictate what you do more than I like, and makes it incredibly difficult to identify what role others will chose. 
-Dice influencing my decisions takes away skill. 
-More of a solitaire game than the original (which already is quite solitaire based).  
-Game ends abruptly (more so than the original) as you start with a large double tile (1 world and 1 tech) and another world. Thus start the game with 3 tiles in your tableau opposed to 1, and they are randomly selected!

Can't be a 10 for me as I hate the randomeness but it is the shortest strategy game I ever played which did not feel like it was "just" randomness. Can be pretty random and stuff can go really bad for one but at the moment my favorite newcomer.

Short and dice and well designed? What more do you want? Okay... it could be available more and not that overpriced.

Colonizing planets is fun, it's a very colorful game, and the amount of dice you get to roll separates this from most other dice rolling games. 

But I always feel like I have more fun having a ton of dice than I do with actually strategizing, getting points, and taking actions, and I'm not usually entertained by something as simple as rolling a bunch of dice, but that just means this game doesn't offer me much more than that.

I played it now more than 20 times - and I guess I'll play it till I fall - but this game still feels good when I'm at the table.

Quite hard to explain to non-gamer newbies, so I highly advise more experience players to, after playing their own board, help the new guys, pointing at possible initial strategies and teaching them on how to organise the dice properly.

Really split about it as it has some parts I like very much and others I really dislike. The evolving "engine" is nice, as is the theme and artwork, the decisions to make, and the play time of about 45 minutes feels right, maybe even a bit on the short side. I dislike: The mostly solitaire experience as only quick peeks during the action selection phase offer some "player interaction", bad dice rolls in critical moments can really set you back, the sometimes very uneven game play with rounds you can do a lot and others you can do very little, and the non-intuitive game play that makes explaining it properly quite difficult. At least, my initial fear of a dominant production-shipping strategy seems to be unfounded. Overall, a game I can play (at best with people who already know it) but do not have to.

Replacing colourful, well-illustrated cards with tiny, uninteresting dice is never a good thing, so I didn't expect to like Roll For The Galaxy. It was far worse than I had imagined.

Although people have said that Roll For The Galaxy is easier to learn than Race For The Galaxy, the mystified expressions on the faces of several savvy gamers during our initial play spoke otherwise.

Gone are Race's standardized results and bonuses for the various phases chosen, replaced instead with variable results based on the number of phase symbols on dice rolled. This causes a huge amount of chance to be infused into a game where previously there was none; not an improvement when the dice now block you from taking meaningful action, round after round. Also, the conversion of cards to dice meant that the game's currency converted from cards, held in one's hand that displayed the possibility of future turn actions in an eye-catching manner, to dice whose utility needs to be calculated by understanding the chance of certain symbols being rolled.

With this reduction of currency to a strictly monetary value, the designers implemented a recycling program for the dice, rather than them just be expended as cards were in Race. This added an unnecessary economic element on top of an already complicated and iconographically dense game.

So, Roll For The Galaxy is a bland-looking, overly complicated, chance-dominated game that is maddeningly inferior to its predecessor. I can only hope that this piece of garbage was created to gather funds for a streamlined second edition of Race For The Galaxy.

surprisingly excellent game of dice allocation, with maybe 50% concept overlap with RFTG. Perhaps it's surprising given that "Roll for" as a title starter hasn't had a great track record, esp. vis-a-vis the games they take off of. Also, I have a like-loathe relationship with RFTG.

Only have 3 plays. Enjoyable, but felt like the game ends just as your engine gets roaring. Almost wish it went a little bit longer (like requiring 14 or 15 tiles to end the game instead of 12).

Pros:
-Love the dice building
-Good theme, cool tiles

Cons:
-Slightly clunky dice assigning and pool mechanics, especially for newer gamers
-Ends prematurely

EDIT: Since the above review I have gotten Race for the Galaxy, which after ~8 plays seems to be the much better game (at least at 2). Much faster, feels like you have a more cohesive engine, and easier to understand. A lot of people say Roll is easier, but picking up icons in Race seemed faster (with references) than fully picking up the dice assignment mechanics for new players. Will keep Roll for a while to try it at larger player counts.

This is one game where I finally get to enjoy just rolling a pile of dice. Yes, the randomness can get to you at times, but it plays quickly enough to not be such a big deal. It's similar to Race for the Galaxy, so if you've played that, this shouldn't be too hard to play. I still think the game is a bit much for newer players, but I do think that there is a good way yo explain the rules to make it fairly clear.

After enough plays of this and going back to Race, I think I find I enjoy Race a bit more. This is a bit more fiddly than it needs to be, and the complexity of the rules is comparable to Race.

This is not an average "dice conversion" game. It inherits most of the mechanisms from the card game and create some new compelling and smart ones to introduce the dice. It succeeds at preserving most of the feelings of the original game and not just some "marginal connections".

These mechanics create a globally consistent game that is easy to understand and coherent at the same time. The symbols are easier to understand; RftG fans will make the jump very easily. 

Usually dice games do not feature choices beyond how much you "push your luck". This is not the case. There are plenty of choices to be made here. Still, the game is incredibly short. Veterans can play it in 30 minutes or less. All actions are carried on simultaneously, that means there's no time between turns: you are playing during every minute the game lasts.

I have some criticisms though:
-> The initial factions will condition your strategy.
-> It's not as "easy" to guess your rivals' actions (now they depend on what they need, but also on what they roll; you might know the first, but not the second).
-> You can have runaway players in some game, but they get an early good combo. It's almost impossible to catch up, and even if the games are not long, they do not last the 5-10 minutes my Race for the Galaxy games use to last.
-> The dice are very small (yes, yes, I know there are too many of them and it would have affected its price considerably).


Conclusion: The best dice conversion ever (not even close!) and a great game in itself, with an incredibly short lenght.

Waaaaay better than "Race."  Even though it's a dice fest, it feels like you have a lot of control over the outcomes.  I'm sure this will shine with repeated plays.

RATING: 8
Race for the Galaxy veterans are right at home here. Not too hard for new players either because both the tile effects and the turn sequence are very simple. Planets are especially easy to grasp since they have no permanent effects at all, and their instant effect can be very quickly seen from the icon alone. The only tricky part is the million different types of Reassign powers on Developments;  these are not obvious without reading the tile text.

I really like how payments for develop/settle can be accumulated and stacked, which also lowers the luck factor of rolls. Other than that, the game plays pretty much like you'd expect based on Race. Of course, all the rolling behind screens means that this can be played only with absolutely reliable players.

Lots of recycled artwork but that does not diminish the experience. Cardboard quality is somewhere between Chinese and German, i.e. does not stink but has somewhat bland colors and the cutting is rougher than in German games.

Gioco che non mi ha del tutto convinto perché non migliora i difetti di Race for the Galaxy (complessità nel riconoscere le icone + le troppe combo comprensibili solo dopo molte partite), ma aggiunge alcuni difetti (secondo me) non trascurabili, ovvero la casualità del lancio dei dadi che può essere solo parzialmente mitigata dalla scelta del colore dei dadi da aggiungere al proprio lancio. Un gioco in sostanza divertente per giocatori assidui che in poco tempo possono apparecchiare un giochino per nulla banale e che necessità di molta tattica e un po' di intuito ma che per via della pesca delle carte e del lancio dei dadi di presta, forse fin troppo, alla sorte. Gioco comunque da provare.

All the feel of Race, with a great dice mechanic bunged on top and none of that pesky iconography. Much more accessible for wives and girlfriends, and much easier to play time and time over to discover the various combos. There is a lack of interaction, though, and it starts to feel like a solo puzzle in some games.

Unplayable due to badly chosen, confusing dice colours. Obviously neither the designer not the publisher considered colour-blind players. I cannot imagine trying to play while somehow tracking all the dice colours in my head, and of course the dice are custom made. Consequently I had to keep physically examining dice just to keep track of their type. This was tedious for everyone. Otherwise RftG looks quite interesting - I'm genuinely disappointed.

RATING: 8
maybe the best dice game I've played.  First: it does away with the Yahtzee! mechanic (re roll dice you don't like).  Second: it mitigates bad luck with an automatic reassign (i.e. One die gets flipped to whatever face you wish) and with the "Dictate" mechanic (give up one die to reassign a second, once per turn).  Third: once used, dice must be bought back, making for some important economic choices (I.e., not everything you do can do to building your economic engine).

How does it compare to Race?  I like it way better!  One, it cuts out most of Race's symbology which has made Race a no-go for anyone I've played it with who wasn't a prior CCG/LCG player. Two, fewer tiles (analogous to cards in Race) means fewer power combos to give deep players huge advantages. Three: totally anecdotal, but it feels like I can actually accomplish more of what I set out to do in a turn than in Race.

As a fan of Race for the Galaxy and dice games, I just had to try the dice version. Turns out it's even better than the card game (which I still consider the best in its own category).

The dice randomness is entirely mitigated by the rules and the set of tiles you can take advantage of. You can always do something each round, and with a little planning even bad rolls can be used to your advantage.

Every game feels different, and the wide choice of starting tiles really helps with that.

Oh, and the art doesn't bother me like it does with Race. Meaning it's not so bad, in this new game.

[b]Roll For the Galaxy[/b]

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]Race for the Galaxy is my favorite game and I love dice games so I couldn't wait for this to be released. It definitely exceeded my expectations, Roll manages to capture the essence of what makes Race great, but delivers it in a very different play experience. The expansion adds a lot to the base game without introducing new mechanics. The added starting tiles offer the opportunity to draft your starting tiles similar to Race and the new dice build on what was introduced in the base game by allowing you additional flexibility with dice placement. I will mention that Race is still my #1 game, but Roll is probably #3 so not too shabby.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]- Excellent translation of Race for the Galaxy into a meaty dice game.
- Beautiful art and production quality, everything feels/looks top notch.
- Much easier to teach than Race; the iconography is greatly reduced and the tiles have their powers printed on them.
- Double sided tiles are a great solution for the explore action, there are plenty of times when you really would benefit from both options.
- Having produce before ship is more intuitive and helps streamline the produce/ship strategy and
- Purple die; boosts the produce/ship strategy by acting as a wild color (effectively increasing the value of goods consumed).
- There are a lot of strategies to explore in this game giving Roll high replay value.[/i]

I love how it takes elements that I like from Race and streamlines them.  It has alot of good things going for it, but I miss the agonizing decisions of what cards to keep in Race.

There aren't as many decisions as there are in Race, which I thought was going to be a negative for me. But Roll is so much more accessible and so much fun for me and just about every group that I have played it with, that I play it every chance that I get. I'm glad that I have both of them in my collection, and am up for either game just about any time.

I probably have this over-rated -- BUT -- I really enjoy the gameplay of games like San Juan, so...  Our first game ended pretty quickly.

Even so, it was still a relatively close game.

What an amazing smooth game. Slightly difficult to teach only because that content of the tiles and essentially what they do/benefit is not apparent to those new to RFTG universe. The actually mechanic of the game play is really easy to teach and by the second game player are already competitive. The low play time allows this game to be played consecutively multiple times in one game night. I would say this game hovers around the gateway game thresh hold but has so much depth and replay ability for veteran gamers. Cannot wait for the expansion to add more tiles!

RATING: 7
The iterative nature of the dice manipulation provides more involved decision making, but it does make the game feel much longer than Race and that's not a good thing. There are far fewer effects (which you're trying to acquire with the dice) to review and build towards, which means much of the charm of Race (the search and deployment of combos) disappears. Now the effects are more along the lines of build this to get more dice, or manipulate dice, or get better results if this colour die is used to do that. Basically, the effects are much less interesting and the constant dice manipulation decisions grow wearying rather than more exciting as the game progresses.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The dice manipulation and drafting is really cool.  Still, it took me a while - about 10 plays to really get into the groove with this game.  This game is meant to be fast paced.  But there is a lot of symbology and the rule book is not written clearly.  Constantly having to check the rules, and not being able to find a the answer you are looking for quickly, really slows the game down.  Scouting out new worlds also slows the game down.  It takes many plays to really feel comfortable with this game.  But once you know it well enough, it will be a fun and fast filler - about 30 minutes.  It is not deep or intense strategically. But as a light filler, I'd say it gives you meaningful decisions.

Game is addicting fun! Plays faster than Race, IMO. Not a 10 because the dice are too small, IMO, and I wish the tiles cycled differently than the bag mechanism via mega-exploring. After learning this, I couldn't stop thinking about it. I still love Race, but I believe I'm keeping both.

I really really stink at this game. But, I cannot help it, it is FUN!!

"Excellent streamlined interpretation of RftG, although a couple rules are slightly counter-intuitive. If I enjoyed leaching games, this would rate a lot higher. Dice are fun."

- Has the flavor of Roll for the Galaxy, but has fewer icons
- Dice are pretty, and functional

What I don't like:
- Leaching/outguessing are not mechanisms I tend to enjoy
- A couple rules are a bit counter-intuitive
- Screens make it a bit hard to teach

Ok... This is quite good! Really liked this. I think I might pull this out for 3 players rather than RftG. RftG is still my preferred game but I can see this one work really well with 3+ players. Once the rules are taken in, this game doesn't last that long either. Great fun.

Of so I bumped it down after my initial hype over this game. Also, by comparison, this game is just really a game when mixed in with the expansion which is a little bit of a let-down for me. Some of the components should have been part of the base game and it feels like the expansion was designed to deal with some of the issues that made the base-game so slow-paced and heavy credit-dependence.

Race still rules! This is neat but am starting to think that maybe not worth having both and I would keep race in a heart-beat any day.

I have nor decreased its rating further down. I find this game to be fundamentally redundant. The card game is vastly superior, much more elegant, faster and also less noisy. There is no reason why I would ever prefer to play Roll for the Galaxy over Race for the Galaxy...

RATING: 4
Hugely overrated. Wasn't the biggest fan of race, even less a fan of this one. Too easy to manipulate dice to get what you want. Worlds are boring. Zero player interaction. Strange, non intuitive and eye offensive rules that allow you to put a non matching die in a row. 

I'm beginning to think that the top 50 on BGG is nothing but a selection of solo games, proving that the vast amount of gamers here can't find anyone to play with. How else does Mage Knight make it to number 10? 

roll is a watered down version of race. Wife also didn't care for it at all so off to the trade pile it goes.

After first try (a three player game): It feels as complex and balanced as the card game but less complicated. You have less to read, easier play-flow but still as many strategic choices. Love the implementation of the dice. 

I have played this several times now and have had to up my rating since I never grow tired of it. Even if it is less variation than in the card game, and you after several plays recognize many situations it's still fun. 

Nowadays we often play three players with a setup where everyone gets three of each starting tiles and gets to combine them into three pairs. Then we play three matches, one with each pair.

I am not a fan of Race for the Galaxy but I love this game. The whole time I was playing Race for the Galaxy I didn't even really know what was going on. This game really simplified the game, removed the confusing symbols and added a very satisfying dice rolling mechanism. Give it a try if you haven't.

RATING: N/A
I'm kind of disappointed with this game. I've been enjoying my plays and still hasn't given up on it, but I'm kind of surprised that all the rave reviews failed to mention some pretty major faults, in my opinion:
First, there is almost no player interaction. This is the definitely the most mutliplayer solitare in my collection, and I don't know it will stay that way. Sure, the phase selection is pretty big but by golly, that's all there is. If someone gets a great engine going early on because of their faction and a good set up planet, there's literally nothing you can do about it. If you're digging for something and you're not finding it, that's basically it for you. The only other way you can affect another player is going for victory point and speeding up/slowing down the end game condition. Sure, skilled players would pay attention to what other people are doing to try and guess what phases they're going to trigger - but that's a lot of work for very little payoff. Your guess is usually not that much better than assuming equal probabilities. And it's really easy to just focus on what you're doing, and not care too much about what's happening elsewhere. The simultaneous play, while it is assume as there's really no downtime in the game, only exacerbates the problem. Half of the time you won't even see what other people are doing.
Second, there is basically no theme. Which is shocking, as SU&SD praised it for the match of theme and mechanics - I think it's the posterchild of the absence of such connection. I mean, it could be just anything - it's exactly like Spyrium in this way, you have techniques that give you long term abilities and mines that give you stuff. It could have been coal, spyrium, gold, you name it - you could place it anywhere. The pretty dice are just... dice. The blue is blue, the green is green - you never feel like you're splicing genes when you're producing green, you're just producing green. Red has absolutely nothing to do with military, the names are just empty. Perhaps it's because lots of people played race for the galaxy beforehand and I haven't, but the game feels nothing like doing anything in space. It's just an engine building game with production facilities that rewards efficiency. A good one, but it has no theme. I haven't even looked at the art of my tiles or read their titles until I finished my first game - I never really had to think about it while playing, and I think that's a big failure of a game if it doesn't evoke its own theme.

That being said, it's one of the more satisfying engine building games that I've played. The dice rolling and luck mitigation is interesting and exciting. Choosing a phase and guessing what other phases might come is really fun and the risk/reward involved is awesome. The components are great, and I love everything about the simultaneous placement of the dice. For my money, executing the phases should be done sequentially so that people will see what other people are doing. It doesn't take that long anyway (maybe except for exploring, but that's also most important). You just wait your turn to develop/settle/ship, it takes a minute.

In sum, I will play it a few more times with more players but I won't play it with my game group. It's a good game for new people, or people who love avoid conflicts, or people who play slowly - it's a nice little puzzle with a sliver of interaction when you try to figure out what phases other players will go for.

RATING: 5
After several more plays, the excitement of the dice clinking around in the cup has worn off.  The game seems to have more fiddly  procedure than Race and hence does not play as smoothly.  I also do not find the powers on the tiles nearly as interesting nor as varied as the cards in Race.  This is particularly true of the planets.  The planets in Roll are just plain dull.  They give you dice when you build them and after that they are just a location for production.  And the grey planets don't even go that far.  After you get your die from a grey world, the planet just sits there.  A lot of people have said they really like the double sided tiles.  This is scant praise since you see far more cards in Race than tiles in Roll.  So even with the double sided tiles in Roll, you still get more choice in Race.  I will continue to play Race hundreds of times per year (mostly online), but I doubt I play Roll five more times total.

My favorite part of race is seeing my tableau take shape and getting all the cards to work together. This game doesn't really have that, but it does have the puzzle-y aspect of trying to manipulate the dice faces and your dice pool to get the dice to do what you want them to do. Roll is fun, but whenever I play roll it just makes me want to play race, since I like the tableau-building aspect better.

As far as dice implementations go this one is very good perhaps one of the best. Unfortunately I find dice games too random. Is it better than Race? Absolutely not! Too random for me. Die rolls, what actions others pick, tile draw, starting worlds etc. The game is also so much longer too.

Billed as the "dice version of Race for the Galaxy", Roll for the Galaxy doesn't attempt to present a game that's easier or less deep.  As in Race, this game is at its core a role selection game that's about resource management, but instead of the cards being resources, the dice are.  While this game doesn't present the multitude of confusing icons, the array of choices is still dizzying--exemplified by the daunting wall of text on your player screen.  This one definitely take a half-dozen plays just to understand how the system works.  Not sure I'm up for that kind of investment.

Alright, so here is my thoughts on this game. It's definitely not better than the card game. Not even by a long shot. It just feels a lot clunkier than it's predecessor and it's slower as well. The flavor is still there, but it just makes me want to play Race instead. I'm not sure what I think of it as a 2 player game, but it seems to work out mechanically similar to a multiplayer game.

Nice dice, thick cardboard components and a decent rulebook. A lot to like, but so far I'm not in love with it.

[b]Update:[/b] Well, I gave this game a fair shake. I wanted to like and I tried to like it, but it never clicked with me. I absolutely adore Race and this just felt like a cheap knock off. The people that say this game is both easier to teach and easier to learn are full of themselves. The icon system in Race is spectacular. You need 2-3 games of it (see 1-2 hours) and you'll have the game down. Roll just felt too text heavy and the explore phase is obnoxious. The expansion may save this game slightly, but if I had to pick between the two, Race would win 100% of the time. This game is Cult of the New hype.

So.. the dice version of my all time favourite (and most played) board game/card game - Race for the Galaxy. What surprised me most was that the play time for this game is actually longer than the the game it´s based on. But this is a good thing - this allowed this game to have it´s own feet and have almost the depth the card game has. It certailny has been simplified in some areas, but then again the action selection system is much more compicated and deep. The dice luck is well mitigated with the freedom of choosing one die to do any phase you want and also thanks to various powers to manipulate dice. Components are very pretty (although engraved dice would have been nice) and artwork is just amazing. Some of the art has been reused from RftG, but not too much. Of course I still like RftG itself better (more elegant design, plays quicker while still is deeper and more complex) but currently Roll is the hotter game for me - lot to discover for me still.

Ocena po jednej grze. Bardzo podobna do race for the galaxy, ale bardziej się czuje to co się robie. Płacenie kartami było nieco abstrakcyjne, zatrudnianie roobtników (kostek) i wykorzystywanie ich jest bliższe wyobrażneiu tego na czym polega gra.
No i te kostki... :)
Update: po kolejnych grach jednak stwierdzam  że mimo wyżej wymienionych zalet gra jest bardzo statyczna, brak interakcji jest jeszcze bardziej widoczny i doskwierajacy niż w wersji karcianej. 
Nadal uważam że gra jest wizualnie przepiękna.

This game is real fun! For me it is the perfect filler. Easy to learn and .... there are lots of dices!!!!!! But dont be too serious when playing. There is a luck factor. But not the dices are the problem, it is the drawing of techs and worlds which can hurt/push you really hard. But with this in mind you will have a great time playing this fast game.

I really wasn’t sure what to expect from this. I’m a big fan of Race, and dice re-implementations often fall short of their progenitors. However, the designers of Roll have done something very clever. Instead of dumbing the game down by making it a press-your-luck experience, Roll comes in as a tight, thinky dice game more akin to games like Castles of Burgundy or Troyes than Roll Through the Ages and its ilk. Players experienced with Race will jump right into Roll with just a quick explanation. I’ve heard Roll lauded as easier to teach than Race, but I’m not sure that’s entirely the case. Sure, all development and world abilities are explained via text, but there are still plenty of unfamiliar icons that players will have to grasp. 

Regardless, Roll is a really satisfying experience that begs for repeated plays, even back-to-back (a rarity in my groups). I’m not sure it has the same depth as Race. Exploration is more difficult, so the game seems a bit more tactical in that players will often be making the most of the tiles they draw rather than digging for tiles specific to a preferred strategy. Perhaps surprisingly, I don’t feel that the dice are too lucky as the game provides ways to mitigate bad rolls. 

This game sings on so many levels - some depth, interesting tactical play, engine/combo-building, variable set-up, and all in a short play time. For now it’s an 8/10, with a chance to go up.

I get to play this at my local meetup and I had fun even though I lost to all the veterans.

This game is what I envisioned dice games to be like! The dice games I have played so far are too light and random for my taste. (Las Vegas, Dungeon Roll, Elder Sign, Escape from Cursed Temple, Machi Koro, and Zombie Dice) This game is the first one in these games that I've played to reach an 8/10. Kingsburg is too high roll dependent and Alien Frontiers is too confrontational. Manila is a betting game but it is a bit too much like gambling a bit too long.

It is in the veins of PR or San Juan and although I haven't played race for the galaxy this game pretty much sticks 3 rounds into the game. It feels a bit multiplayer solitaire but to play well one needs to guess what role people are going after. I need to learn how to use dictate to my advantage because if you follow the roll results you'll probably lose.

---- Update ----
I got to play this again at my local meetup, but this time with my wife in the game. She said the space theme is too abstract for her so this is gone from the wishlist. I guess theme matters more for her than for me.

This game doesn't really have too much with it's brother, 'Race for the Galaxy'. As far as dice game so, it's ok, but not special. 'Nations: the Dice Game" is certainly a better dice game. You have to try and work out what others will do in the round, but that can be really hard to do as it all depends on their dice roll. The dice are nice, though.

Absolutely awesome game. Once the initial learning curve has been overcome, this just plays smooth and fast but with tons of options for how any given turn works out. Love how much of the game comes from developing a sense of  how the other players empires are unfolding and learning how to properly ride their coat-tails to maximize your own turns. Pure, exquisite joy. may be arguably one of my favorite games of all time.

This is a phenomenally fun, laid back competitive economic game wrapped up in a clever sci fi theme.  Each player can "name" one of five game phases per turn, and only phases named by a player actually happen - but you can "piggy back" your workers on phases your opponents named, leading to a fun and intuitive guessing game where you try to predict your opponent's likely declaration.  This can lead to hilarious accidents with two players each saying "AARGH, I thought YOU were going to name X phase!", having second-guessed each other simultaneously...

Plus you get to shake a big batch of pretty dice in a cup.  Noisy fun!  :)

Having played Race for the Galaxy many times, I like Roll for the Galaxy better. Not just because I can actually win at it against my local group, but some of the mechanics help support a more balanced game I find. I feel the changes to Consume (now called Ship) make for a more balanced game, reducing the problem from Race where you can have many producing worlds with no ability to consume what you produce (thus requiring you to call Consume: Trade to extract any value from them).

It can take a few plays to learn how to read the game state (which might make veteran Race players feel uncomfortable because they're back in a more "novice" position). Overall though, the dice mechanic is well-rounded, a bit chaotic, but overall an excellent and novel way to explore the game.

Feels very different from Race. I'm looking forward to playing more - a lot more! - Roll. I'm not in love with it yet, but I have a feeling that like in Race, you really need to play it enough to get a feel for all the different options and strategies to appreciate it fully. You might see a lot less cards/tiles in Roll compared to Race and I wonder how that changes things. Perhaps Roll is more reactive and about managing your little empire and Race has the tougher strategic choices. It's definitely fun.

Mmm, not sure if this is easier to get into than the card game. As with dice games there is the question of how much luck will dictate your strategy, I think I prefer the option of selecting my main action and piggyback on the other players choice rather than hoping to roll the icons to pick/piggyback the action; the card selecting is cleaner rather than messing around with dice. Also I think I miss the tension of having to discard cards to pay for the development/settle. Nah too fiddly

I was never super into Race for the Galaxy, but I liked it. This game for me blows Race out of the water. It's got a similar feel but it uses this mechanism where each player simultaneously selects their main action in secret, then reveals, and if you guessed what other players were planning, you get rewarded by following their action. I really find that so much fun. Plus the dice are cute like little dicemaster dice. I love that the buildings are verbose and explain what they do to you plainly. I wish there were more ways to really effect the other players. It seems like once a player gets a lead it's hard to overtake them. Nearly every game we have a runaway leader with no way to effect them.

A very fun engine-building optimization game, with a good mix of luck and strategy. It's moderately easy to learn and get into, but there is definitely more to think about as you get more comfortable with the game. I like all the different ways you can modify and reassign your dice, so you don't feel too screwed over by a bad roll. I also like that you have to pay attention to what everyone else is doing, both this turn and their overall strategy, so you know what phases are likely to be activated this turn and how long you might have until the game ends. It also plays pretty quickly and leaves me with that "one more game" feeling.

I never tried Race for the Galaxy, but the symbols in this game seemed extremely intimidating at the beginning. After a couple of turns, everything starts coming together and it becomes very fun and exciting. This just becomes a game of using variable phase orders with a space exploration theme. You need to look at all of the tiles yet to figure out which ones have the best synergies.

RATING: 7
Have you ever played Race for the Galaxy? It's a game where you draw cards, play cards, buy cards, and activate cards, all by spending and using cards you have. AND you choose two actions each turn to activate, and you get to use the actions that other people activate too. It's a game that has a huge following, and lots of people love it. 

I THINK THAT IT IS TRASH. Race for the Galaxy (RftG) is a game of pseudoengine building, wherein you need to have the luck to draw good cards, and then get them in the combinations you need. Optimization of how you use them really doesn't exist; you either get the cards you need or you don't. Nothing about it clicks with me, and it's awful.

Roll for the Galaxy (RollftG) fixes ALL OF THIS. The cards that you use for everything in RftG and are also planets and tech are now just Tiles, and are only used as the things they actually represent. Currency, actions, and the like are now represented by a dice pool that you spend, rehire, and reuse, and generates your available actions in a manipulable fashion, as you acquire, use, and rehire the dice of the colors (and corresponding face distributions) of your choice. This game has actual engines, a buildup represented both in planets and tech built, as well as a tangibly growing die pool, and an ability to buy points or cash (for rehiring spent dice), and to just make an effective engine.

HUZZAH FOR RollftG, and may RftG rot in the hell of ever descending pointy knives.

Another efficiency game that is basically a solitaire game. Try and "solve" your inital setup and gain the most points within the limited time frame that is available until the game ends. Pretty bland and not my type of game (If you like Agricola and similar games, you will love this)

Oct 2016: Played again. Surprisingly fast! However, I still have the same problem with this one as I have with Race for the Galaxy; the actions that I'm doing just don't make sense to me! I don't feel like I'm settling, developing, producing, or shipping. I feel like I'm moving dice around.

Feb 2015: I had a surprisingly amount of fun with this one compared to Race for the Galaxy!

* Although it takes way more space than RftG, I found it a bit less fiddly. There's an additional resource, dice, that's easier to manipulate and visualize than face-down playing cards

* Not being able to perform an action you haven't specifically chosen is more dramatic -- in this game, you're able to perform an action more than once (depending on the dice you roll)

Things that slow the game down or make it clunkier are the use of tiles over cards and the screen that hide the dice. The game really slows down with the Exploration phase as players have to (a) wait for the tile sack, (b) decide how many tiles to get rid of (if any) and (c) decide which side of the tile to use.

Rating improved after playing with 4 players rather than 3.  I still don't like the explore mechanic, and the dice luck in phase selection (quite possibly that latter would improve with more plays).  Prefer Race or Jump Drive depending on context.

Still a bit early to say whether it's a 9 or higher; I've only played it 20 times in the last 2 weeks.

Two weeks later and it's a 10.  Is it as good as Race For The Galaxy (another 10)?  In some ways yes, in some ways no, and in some ways it's better.  In any event, it's a great game and I can't imagine turning down a game, ever.  

Given a few more months, it's conceivable that I'll stop bullying, threatening and cajoling others into playing it, but for now that is my standard operating procedure.  If you see me approaching with the Roll For The Galaxy box under my arm, you have been warned.

Six months later and I still feel the same way about this wonderful game.  And the new expansion only makes it better!

Not a fan of this game. I can see the appeal and do not think it's a bad game at all but it's just not for me. I'm not a fan of dice at all so it is not a surprise that I didn't love this game but I do think the dice are used creatively in this game. I think I didn't like how fast the game can end because it happens right as you start to get on a roll, pardon the pun. Great components.

This offered nothing for me.  Completely undercut the joys of the original game and increased the mess on the table.

I want to love it, but it feels very bland and not as strategic as I liked. It feels like a single player game to me since there are hardly any interactions with other players.

Fans of San Juan and Race for the Galaxy will find familiar mechanics here.  In fact this game stands in the middle of those two mentioned games in terms of difficulty. build an interplanetary empire, and use it to score victory points.  This time, use some dice and the symbols on them instead of just some cards

Roll for the Galaxy has hit the table more than many of my other games. It only takes 20-25 minutes to play for me and my wife. It offers some great strategies that change based upon your starting faction power and your chosen developments. It is very hard to teach. The only way to learn it is to play it. Once you have played it 5-10 times you will be able to pay attention to all your special skills, and really cultivate a strategy each game. What makes this game amazing is how much strategy and thought you can get out of 20 minutes, but a lot of times the final round is over and you kind of wanted a bit more game and strategy. The short time is what makes this game great though. It gives you much more than a filler in a filler time frame. *** WIfe:7

One play in, and I really enjoyed it. I just like the look and flow of this game. It took us three times longer to play than the box says, but it was a learning game. I can see this going a lot faster once all players are familiar with the rules and game flow.

Update: Once all players have played once, the game is much faster if you play as the rules say and all execute each phase simultaneously. If you play with someone who insists on reviewing everyone's move to guarantee it's by the book, this game will slow way down.

I'm knocking this down slightly and raising up Alien Frontiers because, although they are both dice rollers (radically different use of dice), AF does a better job with theme, I think. I just don't get a sense of what it is I'm building in Roll/RaceftG.

Not sure how I feel about this game. I like the die selection mechanism, but wish it was easier to customize a path (drawing planets at random and getting colours that are not ideal, etc). It may be that I don't quite get how to plot an optimal path yet; this keeps me optimistic that the game will probably grow on me with more plays.

Great game! One of my favorites!

I love the dice and tableau building. You can pursue different tactics and you might discover some combos that you never thought would work!

I've seen quite a few complain about the multiplayer-solitaire problem that the game seem to have.
I personally don't have a problem with this. I never feel like I'm playing my own little game. You have to be aware of what the others are doing: What phases will they activate? Do I have enough time to go for this strategy? Should I change anything I'm currently building? etc.

Lots of choices to make. The dice rolling isn't a random luckfest, but very mitigable.

I'm a big fan of dice, and this is the rare type of game that doesn't sacrifice much by transitioning into a dice game, but it's just not quite as fulfilling as Race for the Galaxy. I think it's because I don't enjoy the idea of sacrificing a die to treat another as a wild. It feels too forgiving, even though the game would be way too long without that mechanic. I just wish there was a less awkward method to help keep the pace.

Things I like about Roll for the galaxy:

1) I enjoy how the luck of die rolling is mitigated by the way you place the die.  You can always place one die on any phase regardless of result, which is great.

2) It does a great job of being different from Race for the Galaxy, while still feeling like Race.  All of us that played felt it helped a lot to be familiar with the original game, but that Roll for the galaxy was very much it's own game.

3) The components are well made.  The tiles are thick, durable, and pleasant to look at.  The bags are nice and sturdy.  The dice, while pretty much "no frills" in the looks department, are very functional and easy to read.  Considering how many dice are in the game, I am glad they kept cost down and went with the "spartan" die appearance.

Things I don't like:

Currently I have no issues with Roll for the Galaxy.  Repeated plays may change this, but for now I am quite pleased.

Great game.  I think I prefer it to Race for the Galaxy, but still a little too early to tell for sure.

Race is all about getting cards and using the cards to develop, settle, or sell (after they become goods).  This one is similar, but once you've got a die, you keep it (you don't discard dice), but you need to 'buy it back' prior to being able to use it again.

Fun game.  My son Dallin and I have really enjoyed this one.

A ton of dice?  Yikes...didn't think I'd like it.  Turns out I did.  This is a great game.  It's one that I find myself giggling while I play.

I think this game is better with more players because there are usually more actions happening.

The only negative I have for this game is probably the barrier to entry.  If it's your first time playing it, you won't get it (not fully, anyway).  It takes until the second play to understand and appreciate what is happening.  This ALMOST had me missing out on this great game!  After my first play through I was thinking "meh, whatever...".  After the second play through I was thinking "more? yes, please."

Excellent dice rolling game with worker placement, simultaneous action selection, and just enough dice manipulation to mitigate random die rolls while still maintaining uncertainty of the outcome.

We played a 2 player game and it works excellently without resorting to a full dummy player.  I can't wait to try it with more players, as it seems as though it would scale well.

The theme seems pretty pasted on, as I barely paid any attention to the names of the tiles I was building.  I mainly only cared about their game effects.  However, the mechanics are engaging enough that this didn't bother me.  Theses mechanics have created a deep game that seems to have many different strategies that I can't wait to explore.

There can be some analysis paralysis when deciding what to dice to use, however we found this to be fairly uncommon and only lasted 10-ish seconds when it did occur.  The dice face probability table on the screen is an incredible resource to help situations like this.

RFTG is one of my favourite games but difficult to teach and get others to play.  Like an onion, the layers of strategy only reveal themselves after many plays.  This along with the iconography makes it fall flat for new players.

Roll promises more of the same, but with an easier way to teach and text to explain each icon.

Race is a really good 2 player game , giving each player 2 actions per turn.  Roll doesn't do this so and the player count of 3 or more seems to be the sweet spot.

They both have that mechanism of leaching extra actions off other players, if, you can guess what action they would take it.  So, I would disagree with comments about it being a solitaire game.

Overall, i've not played Roll enough to feel i can fully appreciate & compare to Race but the people that have tried it with me, have all enjoyed it.

As a big Race fan, as well as being as susceptible as the next gamer to the allure of lots of custom dice, this was always going to be a game I ended up getting. Even though we got the game in January 2015, I've not played it that many times - a handful of 2p games, and a couple with 4 or 5. There's no particular reason for that, though - although for the moment I am not actively seeking more plays, I do enjoy the game, finding it a very interesting translation of RftG to a dice-based format, which captures quite a lot of the feel of the original game while also playing quite differently. Race is one of my favourite ever games and I can't quite see Roll ever quite catching up to it in my estimation, but I do find it very enjoyable and can see it getting close if I were able to play it as often as I did Race when I was new to that game. (At that time we had much fewer games so could afford much more frequent plays of the games we particularly enjoyed!)

I've heard a lot of hype about this game in my gaming group, yet strangely managed to never play it or even see it played. So many people I know declared how great they found this game, yet it never seemed to get brought along to gaming meetups. With such vocal backing, it was inevitable that we'd pick it up at some point - which is just what we did a while back.

To start with, the look and components. I have to say, I do like the box art. It's well done and functional, but not flashy. The box is sturdy and holds all components comfortably, with room for expansions (something I really like in a game!). The game tiles are all thick and sturdy, and a good play size, with nice art on both sides. Given how the dice are used ingame, their size is small but appropriate. The quality of the dice is quite good, with all sides identifiable as to their action. The secrecy/information screen feels a little more flimsy, compared to other components, and isn't really a great size/shape if really trying to hide your dice from others. Of course, a simple solution to this is to play with friends who won't cheat - so I don't think this is a major issue.

As a colour blind gamer, I do take issue with the colours of the dice/cards. So many of the different dice just look the same to me, that it really takes away from being able to play the game seamlessly. I am aware that the game was specifically tested with a R/G colour blind tester - and the designers implemented all of his suggestions! Unfortunately, the print run didn't come back like the prototypes. So it's hard to hold the colour issue against them. Since my girlfriend has promised to mark all the dice/cards for me - I can't give negative marks here :) 

Moving onto the gameplay, and I admit that there is a bit to understand in the rules for the game. However, once these are understood, then a game round can move quite quickly. Each dice action is pretty easy to work with once you know what each one does. The game does get a bit more complex when you have multiple developments, and you have to keep track of abilities yourself (or watch other players, if you don't trust them....). But, all in all, a game round is pretty simple and moves quickly.

I read a lot of complaints about the dice in the gameplay. Being a dice based game, dice will go for and against you over the course of a game. That's the nature of rolling a six sided dice. The gameplay is completely based about getting your dice to do actions. Whichever player gets the most dice consistently active each turn, they will win. "Lucky" rolls can't be depended on, ever. But we do have the ability to manipulate our dice! 
We start with two ways to manipulate your rolled dice (choosing your action, and the dictator ability), but can obtain more by building developments. When you have dice manipulation effects in games, getting more is generally the only choice. If you do it, then you gain consistency in your turns - so you can actually choose a strategy to pursue. If you don't - then you're just playing with random dice luck. Either it'll go well and you'll feel great - or it'll go bad and you'll curse the game for just being bad luck. Given that this game is completely about action economy - the more of your dice that are being used for actions, each turn, the better. Getting dice manipulation abilities in other games normally just comes with a cost, given how strong they make the rest of your game. Here, the developments that give you dice manipulation effects ALSO give you points! Um, hell yeah! Now the race is to get these effects early, so all my subsequent turns are more consistent. This means now we have an extra luck element ingame - do you get lucky and draw the cards early that give you dice manipulation or do you not? Add to that, the starting planet/abilities - some are just much stronger than others. Another "getting lucky" draw at the start of the game to add. 

The theme of the game does start to get lost a bit in the gameplay. At no point do I really feel that I'm building a Space Empire. I take a planet, I get a new dice - then mostly ignore that planet (though that's partly to do with the colour blind, mixing up the colours). I get a new development, I try to remember to use my new ability. Of course, we do put the card down and our space on the table expands - but I never really got the feeling of actually building out an Empire. I guess I might just be nitpicking here.

All of these luck elements are fine, though. I don't mind dice, dominant strategies, startup luck, game theme. The next gameplay part is the bit that turns me off most about the game. The game is essentially just a single player game. Another review described it best as "Multiplayer Solitaire". For the first few turns, I took an interest in what my opponent did. How she built up, what dice she was getting, what her new abilities were. After a while, I realised that it didn't matter what she did. She couldn't affect my "Empire" at all. There is no direct interactions between players. The only way that another player affects you is in the action they choose to perform. I appreciate that you can say that there is a strategy here. If you can predict what your opponent will do, then you'll possibily get to do extra actions from dice that wouldn't have did anything that turn. My solution, in each game we've played, is to focus on getting dice manipulation effects. That way, I could properly ignore having to predict what she'd do and still have most of my dice in play each turn. This lack of player interaction is just ridiculous in a 2-5 player game.

Game turns can be pretty quick, but this is not a "fast" game. So, the lack of player interaction feeds into an issue with the lack of any catchup mechanic. If someone falls behind with bad luck early, they're really just playing with no way to ever catch the leader. If there was some kind of player interaction, then the bottom players could collectively gang up to slow down the leader - and give themselves a chance to catchup. But no, the leader is playing his own single player map - so some players will be out of the game, but still forced to play to the end. While our games so far have not seen a runaway leader, I can easily see it happen in 4/5 player games. 


My feelings, as you might guess, are a little torn. So, if I ask myself:
"Is there a game here?" - Yes, there is. There is fun in building up of your "Empire" and it all looks nice with decent quality components. 
"Will I play it again?" - Again, yes. I think I know too many people who seem to really like it to avoid it. 
"Is this a game that I'd ever suggest playing?" - I'd have to say, no. If I'm playing a game with other people, I want to play "with" or "against" them. But here, I'm really doing neither until counting up the scores at the end. There are too many better games on our shelves for me to ever suggest taking this one down.

Going by the BGG rating system, for me it slots in easily as: "4 - Not so good - but could play again."

My favorite of the recent batch of dice games. I'm a big fan of Race for the Galaxy and I've played countless games mostly 2p with my son. Roll takes the genius of Race and strips away the AP around action choices and the challenge of learning the iconography. While Roll shares the theme of Race, the dice mechanic make it a very different game. Only two games so far so it's too early to decide if the strategy has suffered. Bottom line: I'm happy to play it many more times to find out. Really like this game.

I'm not a great fan of games that involve mostly luck, so I tend to stay away from dice games.  But this dice game is incredibly strategic as you can often 'repurpose' your dice. Really good fun, and quite different from game to game.

The only (minor) downside is that it can feel a *bit* like you're each playing your own separate solo game next to each other: a little more interaction would be nice.

I suspect this one is easier for a new player to get used to than the card game.  From initial plays feels a bit more streamlined and faster with many of the same challenges as the card game.  I suspect the separation of resources into dice and tiles instead of everything in the cards helps with the feeling of being streamlined and easier to understand.

That said, suspect the game will have a sweet spot with a few more players.  Three players worked, but don't really see it working as well with 2.  Curious to see if more players is better, though concerned that 5 might bog down just a bit.

While I like dice games, I worry that the luck may be a little high in this one, especially in the 2 player version.  I also worry that the starting worlds are not balanced -- better quality shipping worlds seem vastly better for bootstrapping than a few extra points.  Both issues seem to stem from the importance of shipping to keep your engine running.  Thus, starting with shipping infrastructure and rolling the right faces to keep it going are both important.

update: after another play, I found the game clean but frustrating.  If you don't draw cheap worlds early, you can't get more dice to bootstrap.  If you don't roll settle icons, you can only gain new dice inefficiently.  Once things get rolling, it's fine, but the early game is random and influential.

None-the-less, I find the game somewhat pleasing.

This ranks alongside Five Tribes for the diversity of ways to achieve victory. I think it takes a little bit more than Five Tribes for people to grasp but when they do this game becomes fast and fluid and more than a little bit about trying to read each others mind... please trigger explore, you know you want to.

I'm not sure what the designers were trying to do with this game? The changes from RftG made this game much more luck based yet just as complicated with the rules/symbols for new players.  There is not a lot of strategy involved as everything you do is based on what you can roll.  It's not deep enough to be a strategy game and too deep for a casual game.  The game is just as confusing and complicated for new players and now it's all luck based.  Horrible!

decent enough game, but i think there are only two reasons this remains in my collection: 1.) solos fairly well, and 2.) i don't already own Race. also, the wife likes it, although neither of us care to play often. it's awfully swingy and random, although, i have to admit, not as chaotic as you'd expect a dice game to be. when i first learned the game it was from guys who could seriously compete and expect to win most games. good for them. my wife and i don't care to memorize a few "best tiles" and dig through the bag to find them. actually, i think we don't dig through the bag nearly as much as we probably should. okay, but that's not really the game we'd like to be playing and i have others which really do this for us. hmm, maybe i will get rid of this game. i'm still up in the air whether i'll buy Race or just stick with Jump Drive. i'd recommend this game to anyone with a small collection who wanted to buy a single engine building game which rewards repeated plays, limits boring downtime (simultaneous turns!), and definitely ends when someone is winning (can only build 12 tiles, no switching out early bad tiles for better ones if you're suddenly rich). not recommended for kids since it's not at all hard to cheat and the vigorous cup rattling could easily become too intense for aunts and uncles.

16-06-2015. Sold after 4 plays. I do like the game, but its hard for me to get to the table. I am not interested enough in the game to keep it around to explore it further. Somehow, these kind of games never hit the table.

07-05-2015. Rated after 3 plays. Err.. I didn't like this so much with 2 player. Engine ground to a halt, and many of the dice each turn were wasted utterly.

26-04-2015. Rated after 1 play. I can teach Roll for the Galaxy I think.

It's easy. Each turn, everyone rolls the dice they have in their cups. With the rolled dice, you can activate a role, and take actions showing the die-faces. You are only sure that your role will activate and any action you assigned with it. If you assign dice to a role you don't take yourself, you have to hope/think other players will take the roll.

Using this system, you explore planets and technologies to develop. You research or explore those, both represented by one role. Then one role lets you charge planets with trade goods an lastly you can ship those trade goods to get money or VPs. At the end of your turn, you spend money to regain dice you rolled. If at any time you are not able to take an action because the role was not chosen, you also get those dice back free.

Game is elegant, easy and fun to play. It's quite light, but I suspect interesting depth here. So far, I am intriguied. I do wonder a little if the game has legs, or if it's better than Race. I have not played race.. so I am curious to try that. For now, Roll is on my wish-list, fi it ever come across a cheap-ish copy, I'll instabuy.

I'm really enjoying this. We all agree it is much better than Race for the Galaxy - dice, you don't spend as much time drawing/searching through tiles like you do with cards in Race, and you still have to invest in an action that you think another player will activate to take advantage of it.  My main issue with Race was that there is not a whole lot of table talk/discussion over what others are doing, which is expected with simultaneous actions, but in Roll there is a bit more, as you complain about the dice you rolled and complain that another player didn't choose the phase you thought they would. I'm definitely going to buy this one, and likely try to sell my copy of Race.

This is such a smooth flowing game. It still plays similar to the  Race for the Galaxy game,  however so much easier to understand and to teach. The group we played with were divided. Some really, really loved it and some hated it. But more people love this game than hate it, no real fence sitters when it comes to this game. Players roll dice to do actions to build  out their space empire or create and ship goods for victory points. Not as deep as Race for the Galaxy but even more fun.

Pros: no downtime, all player participation on every turn,  excellent components, fast but engaging gameplay.

Cons: Can still be difficult to teach with foreign game concepts. Learning curve.

Quick paced engine building game. Can accommodate 5 people with little downtime which is nice. Rolling dice is good fun and its the right amount of luck and strategy. Rolling "poorly" never feels that awful as you are given multiple mechanics to change your dice and all the important decisions are left up to the players.

My negative complaint would be that this game has very little player interaction and does not really have a way to encourage it. That is simply part of the game though, so me complaining about it may be like complaining that the sky is blue. Nevertheless, I look for player interaction in my games most of the time so I see it as a downside.

The game is still quality and I enjoy playing it if I'm in the mood.

Race for the Galaxy is one of only three games that I give a [bgcolor=#00CC00][s][color=#00CC00]-[/color][/s][b]10[/b][s][color=#00CC00]-[/color][/s][/bgcolor] rating to. Roll for the Galaxy is essentially an abomination. Alright, not quite an abomination on the level of Ra: The Dice Game. Let's be kinder and say it is instead "a blasphemy." Happier now?

I look forward to watching with bemusement as the critical reception of this game plays out the arc that Trains (a Dominion clone) took a couple years ago.

Phase 1--where we are at as of the moment I'm typing this--is The Gushing, and the "Finally This Replaces..." etc. blah blah. This kind of nonsense will come from variously-motivated folk.

Some of it will come from people who genuinely love Race, and since this game has such a strong echo of Race, these fans will find it to be a very pleasant lark. That's great.

But honestly, I think a lot of The Gushing will come from sincere casual gamers who--though they wanted to like Race--had trouble enjoying it. This would be the crowd you sometimes hear Deploring the Icons. (Which is such nonsense! But that's another tangent!) More likely? Perhaps because they probably had the misfortune of playing Race with other gamers who PLAY A WHOLE LOT OF RACE. And kind of like people who try Dominion casually, when you go up against someone in one of these card games--an opponent who has played the game a thousand times, seriously a thousand times--you are not likely to have a wonderful experience of it. So here's a lot of people who might have been predisposed to like Race, and now are getting a second life on that. Which is great, really.

But as Phase 1 winds down, things will begin to get a little quieter. Roll for the Galaxy is, after all, not a great game. So as that becomes apparent, those that love Race will return to Race, and those that gave Roll a try will drift on to the next thing, except...

Phase 2 (a.k.a. "The Rising Sun Phase"): Suddenly, enthusiasm will get re-lit, as we learn more and more of an impending expansion. The Gushers from Phase 1--who had become strangely quiet--will now reappear briefly. Previous Gushings will have disappeared down the Memory Hole, but the New Line will be that this long-awaited expansion will--what are the phrases we use?--Solve Some of the Problems, or better yet, Add Some Needed Variation to what was, after all, a Good Game that Wasn't Quite There Yet. This phase leads naturally into...

Phase 3. It's a couple of years later. Nobody is talking about or playing the game. Casual players will have drifted off to the next thing, because, well, because that's what casual players do. When cornered, die-hard Race fans will admit that, while Roll for the Galaxy was a lark for a while, in the end, they returned to Race because "it is A Bit More Fun, is A Bit Less Random, and has A Bit More Depth."

Which of course is French for: "it was an abomination."

Err...check that. "A blasphemy."  ;)

Race is so much deeper and superior, I feel. This game has tons of fiddly bits that make setting up and tearing down the game take forever, everyone makes their rolls and choices behind a screen so there's opportunity to set a bad roll to whatever you want and no one would know. And it took out what made Race so much fun and interesting for me, having a hand full of cards that are great and you want to keep but you must discard some in order to build any of them, so which will you choose?

If this came out before Race, I might see the appeal and rated it a bit higher, but this came out after, and I don't understand how anyone could actually prefer this to Race. I have actively avoided game nights where this game was planned so I wouldn't have to play it again.

I originally rated this a 9 but have downgraded it to a 7.  After repeated play it just seems that once you know how and when to capitalise on each of the very few main strategies  your decisions became rather rote depending on the cards you are dealt in you tableau and those that you draw from the bag early on. So in other words, once you know the game it all comes down to blind luck!

Similar theme, different mechanics! Definitely not just a dice *version* of the card game!

I found Roll for the Galaxy mechanically different from Race ("If you've played Race for the Galaxy, you will need to unlearn some rules. If you haven't played Race for the Galaxy, you'll have to learn the rules. Either way, you're even."), and introduce the game this way to experienced gamers. It's kind of information and strategy dense, and most of the players I played with already played Race for the Galaxy. Feel free to post how you teach the game.

"Here's the engine: You need Galactic Credits to move dice from the Citizenry (aka. the unemployment line) to the Cup, use the dice from the Cup to assign to Phases, then return dice used in Phases to the Citizenry. You place Worlds to gain more dice to roll. Developments give you additional abilities. Colored dice are better than the white Home dice.

"Right now, most of you have only one Galactic Credit. You need Galactic Credits to put dice into the Cup from the Citizenry. You can either use Explore to get more Galactic Credits, or Trade, if you have a Good on one or more of your Worlds.

"Roll is a classic "The dice hate you" game. You will either have one Plan A, or multiple Plan C's. There is no Plan B. You can only select one Phase, but may want or be able to do something during other phases. So take a look at other player's worlds. If they have no Goods, they may Produce. If they have a Good, they may Ship. Grey Worlds produce no Goods."

We play the tutorial game open-handed. We analyze and discuss each player's desired moves in detail, and introduce the rules necessary for the player to accomplish this. Answer questions, but focus on questions related to what the current player wants to do. The rules for Exploring to gain Galactic Credits is easy, so we start with a player who's mostly likely to do this, typically a player with no Goods and at least one die under Explore. We first calculate how many GC's he would need to move all his dice into his Cup next turn, then determine how many dice he needs in his Explore phase, then how to select this phase, then Reassignment, if necessary. Next, if a player has a Good on a world, we discuss Trade. If a player has a cheap Development or World in his Construction area, we discuss the Development and Settle phases.

If not all the rules have been introduced, we continue to the next turn. The tutorial ends when each phase has been covered (two turns for five players), making sure all the important details, like the Purple die in scoring VP's, have been mentioned. Not surprisingly, this tutorial takes a long time (two hours for five players) -- but players now know both the rules, and how to plan their moves!

A lot of people say Roll for the Galaxy is better than its cousin, Race for the Galaxy. I'd say they're about even. Roll does some things better, Race does others. 

I think Race is still the more strategic of the two, but Roll feels livelier and has less downtime. I'm not sure if it's shorter but it *feels* shorter, and that definitely scores it some points.

Got in trade. Looking forward to putting some more work in. I read there's also a great Solo variant which is quite exciting. First play was a blast, but then I played Race the following day and felt that was the better game. Now that I own Roll, am sure I'll make the proper judgement after more plays. I do like what am hearing from Rahdo and Joel, that it can be played like a filler (15-20 min) after getting the hang of it.

5 plays: Ok, this game is the shhhhhhhhhhh. Hands down, the best dice game I've ever played. Sooo simple and yet soo deep, and it plays so fast. One of my favorites at the moment. More later, now I just wana play and play. The only thing holding it back from a 10 would be a littl more player interaction and variety on some of the planets, but expansions will probably take care of all that. So for now, i love it for what it is. 

Update: I've won building epic Dynasties and almost never producing. And I won the last game producing and shipping like a madman. Really cool.

Update: Started feeling a little repetetitive in the last couple of games. Also very solitaire experience. My g/f absolutely hated the game and after 5 sessions, it was clear that she would not be persuaded otherwise.

Nice production, fun game. I wouldn't really choose to play it over Race myself, but would be happy to play it if somebody else preferred it. I don't think it's as deep, but it certainly isn't a throwaway game. My honest advice would be to buy Race plus one of the base+1 expansions (Gathering storm, Alien Artifacts) for the money, but I think the dice have a lot of plastic appeal for people at the moment. 

Was nice to see more of the original art, owing to the different shape of the tiles to the cards.

The quality of the components is great, I believe it makes the high price reasonable.
Interaction on the other hand is nearly not there, so if you look for it in games you might want to pass on this. Luck can be decisive some times, but not so often, and even then the game is fast so not a real bother.

Very much like a San Juan with dice, but because the new version of San Juan is such an excellent game (and improvement over the original), it's hard to suggest this instead. It would be a good game to hit the table if I'm feeling like some loud dice rattling. I like the variation between games as I'm dealt new starting planets and developments. It's certainly so simple to follow with the handy screens that it'll be quick to pick up with long breaks between games. There is a certain amount of charm to it and there are some interesting decisions and options to weigh up each turn. The simultaneous rolling and assigning of dice keeps the pace ticking along nicely. As a 60 minute game I can see myself in the mood for exploring this a bit more in the nice light game category. I like the balancing act of using workers for various tasks, but keeping the money coming in so they're not all sitting at the unemployment office (or on developments and planets), instead of in the cup for the next round. The difference between winning and losing is probably in reading what your opponents are going to do. Still, there's not quite enough player interaction for my taste, but it's enjoyable enough.

Race for the Galaxy has been one of my favorite games for many years, and I have many, many plays. 

This new Roll for the Galaxy is wonderful, too. It feels very similar, but definitely not the same. The action selection following the dice rolling is very fresh; this becomes a little personal puzzle every time. There are so many ways to allocate and assign dice that I don't feel too constricted, but it also has a little taste of luck to give each round some flavor. 

The game is not very easy to teach, and takes a few rounds to grock, but once you have it down, it's remarkably smooth and clean. Great game!

Very different from Race. It feels a bit clunkier and is easy to learn, hard to master. The consequences of your actions are  less predictable and it feels like it requires more experience to really oversee the table and the course your actions can take.

A faithful recreation of Race for the Galaxy, with dice.  This still retains most of the positives and negatives of the original.

This was my favorite game from AGF #25. It's a "dice variant" of Race for the Galaxy, a card game that I rarely play because it shares mechanics with San Juan which I think do them better. But Roll for the Galaxy is a novel take on the subject. Familiarly, you need to complete 12 tiles to trigger the game end, the cost to build is a tile is also its victory points, and there are variable phases. Beyond that, it's a fast and interesting dice-allocation game with a huge pile of dice. It's almost solitaire, but there's a subtle depth to the one piece of interaction, which is choosing which one phase you will secretly lock-in. Since only locked phases occur, players take a keen interest in what the others are doing, leading to some gambling and bluffing. I enjoyed it quite a bit!

Everything that's great about Race but without the learning curve and the requirement to know pretty much all the cards inside out.  The ability to see what other players may or may not actually want to do, rather than not knowing what cards they have makes it feel as though you can take more risks, which is what a dice game should be like.

I think Race for the Galaxy is probably a better strategy game (it's certainly faster in my experience), but I'd much rather teach Roll for the Galaxy than Race for the Galaxy. In Roll, there is a ton of variability, particularly once you add the expansion into the mix, and there is still a good amount of strategy. Occasionally one player will get just the right mix of tiles and steamroll everyone else, but most of the time there is a fair amount you can do to improve your chances. Roll is one of my favorite dice games. 

That said, development and settle strategies are a little too strong due to a few tiles that enable those strategies to get going a little too quickly if you get a good combination of them early. I also think a few tiles that enable develop or settle strategies are too efficient. Consume strategies are more viable in higher player count games, where you increase the chance of multiple players calling produce/ship, but they only work in low player count games when no one gets a strong combination for building.

A solid dice twist on Race for the Galaxy.  Normally, the dice versions of games fall flat for me, with a couple of exceptions.  This is definitely one of those exceptions.  Great mechanics that slows down the inevitable Consume x2/Produce strategy that some Race games become.  Double-sided tiles offer some interesting decisions.  Lots of ways to mitigate luck as well.  It's good, but I'll always love Race more.

I've played the prototype and the final version of the game. I did think the final version was a good step up from the prototype I played at Gen Con. I like Race for the Galaxy, but I was nervous this game would just be a way to make more money from the title. I really think Roll for the Galaxy has it's own legs to stand on. I have a feeling my rating might go up with more plays. I've really enjoyed the game so far.

One of my current favorites, so much so I bought the expansion unseen. My family doesn't like the amount of tiles to read and things to keep track of but they love rolling dice. We play it casually as a family. My game friends however are pretty cut throat and games are intense and take a bit longer as people are maximizing each dice placement. I like it both ways; it can be very strategic if you put in the effort.

RATING: 2
(after 1 play)

Nope. Not as good. 

Firstly I must say it's an impressive re-imagining of RFTG, a testament to the designer skills of those involved. The result is actually better than many dice versions of games are, maybe even on the higher level than the line of FFG's another re-imaginings or Arkham Horror. It just fails to deliver exactly the thing I play RftG for, instead this is replaced by the kind of things that make me run away from many euro games.  

RollFTG is a bit simpler than RFTG, way more accessible, because it is in essence an engine building game. I wanted to say I like RFTG because it forces me to think on the spot while RollFTG doesn't, but actually both allow me to think on the spot. However: RFTG demands of me strategic, long term decisions to be made on a spot, big risks, high possible rewards. Whereas RollFTG seems mostly tactical - fiddle with this, change that, adjust this. Selection of tiles is much more random than in RFTG (because: draw engines) - which again makes the game more tactical. 

Summary: it's safer. 
It's more accessible, you don't need as much skill, learning curve is lower, there's less risk, less rewards, less interaction (not that there was much of it to start with). It's more controllable, moves slower, is more forgiving. And supposedly gives you more "choices" (by removing all the hard ones the rest became equal and suddenly more of them are viable). So: exactly what euromasses ordered.

RollFTG is a more typical and "pure" engine building game, which also makes it stand out less between all the engine building euros compared to RFTG.

EDIT rating lowered because I'm not interested in what the game offers. Solid one, but I have RFTG.

I have never played Race for the Galaxy before, but this is a fun little tableau builder in its own right. The management of dice is pretty neat and goes beyond the basic allocation of dice rolls, as you are always looking for ways to expand your dice pool and unlock dice from your citizenry. 

While there's not a ton of interaction, players have to keep an eye out for the phases which are likely to be activated by opponents. It's especially painful if you're the only player who's out of tempo with the rest of the table in producing and shipping.

The main drawback is that it's easy for players to get impatient and begin resolving all phases on their own, which leads to a mess of checking whether everyone is done with their turn. I'd avoid playing this as a 5P game again for that reason alone. Like most tableau builders, I find it's easy to overplay the game to the point of burning out. It's a great game to keep in rotation though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Initial impressions: I like this game. It feels a lot like Race for the Galaxy (not surprising), but there are enough differences that it is definitely its own game. I want to play through several more times to get a better feel for the timing of things.

It might be easier to teach this one to my father. We'll see... he doesn't much care for Race.

RATING: 7.75
Roll for the Galaxy is a solid game where players assign rolled dice to perform actions. Players develop technologies, settle planets, and trade their way to victory points. The component quality is great while the gameplay is only good. 

Fans of Race for the Galaxy should note that with the ability to reassign dice and the double-sided nature of the development/settle tiles, there are more options and decisions in Roll than in Race, and for that I feel that Roll is the better game. Also, the iconography in Roll has accompanying text so that one doesn't have to learn a foreign language of icons just to play the game. 

I still feel that, as far as a space-themed game, Roll for the Galaxy does fall short of Eminent Domain, but that it is still a fun game to play.

[3 plays] Faster and simpler than Race for the Galaxy, but not by a huge amount. The dice avoid some AP perhaps. Comparisons to San Juan help, but the iconography is a burden to me, and the dice and the icons actually make it feel less thematic to me than San Juan. 

To play this competitively, you would really need to study your opponents entire tableau and figure out which phase they are likely to select. That would be crucial, but that is the only thing that makes this an exercise more than a solitaire game.

I think this may be better as a 2 player.

#5 on my Top 100 Games of All Time (2015)

Already a fan of Race for the Galaxy, I was intrigued at the idea of Roll of the Galaxy. I'm not someone that loves dice though. Randomness in cooperative games is just fine- but it's not often welcome in my competitive games. Unless there is a way to mitigate the randomness. And Roll for the Galaxy offers that in many different ways. After my first play of this, I thought 'Whoa. That was amazing! Let's play again!", which isn't something I often say, even if I like a game a lot. But this one plays so quick! And it's so dang fun! It might just make me fall in love with dice after all.

Nagy elvárásaim voltak a játékkal szemben. Egyrészt a nagy előd kártyás változat magasra tette a lécet, másrészt kockás játék sokat kell, hogy mutasson, ahhoz hogy nálam megdöntse az eddigi kedvenceket. Nos 4 db 2 személyes játék után azt kell mondanom erős riválist ismertem meg a Roll for the Galaxy személyében. Kezdjük a jó tulajdonságokkal, mert abból nagyon sokat tudok sorolni. A játék egyszerű, egyszerűbb, mint a kártyás, könnyebben tanítható, gyorsan elsajátítható. Az ikonozást könnyű megtanulni. Az egyes lapkák mindig egy dolgot tudnak és azok a legtöbbször nem különlegesek. A termelő világok megoldása is egyszerűbb a kártyás változathoz képest, az áruk feldolgozása szintén. A kockák helyes használatát kell megérteni és ennyi. A játék gyors, ketten 30 perc vagy még annál is rövidebb idő alatt letolható egy menet és érzésem szerint öten se nyúlna 1 óra fölé, így sok parti lejátszható egymás után. Illetve érzésem szerint minden játékosszámmal jó. Sőt, úgy gondolom többen még jobb, mint ketten. A játék változatos, sok stratégia működik, szinte minden játékom teljesen más volt eddig. A játék szép, bár a kockák csak festettek, nem vésettek, azért szerintem elég tartósak lehetnek. A kockák természetesen visznek szerencsét bele, de mégis úgy érzem a 4 játék alatt, ha 2-3 olyan dobásom volt, amit igazán rossznak értékeltem, a többivel viszont mindig tudtam valami jót kezdeni. Ötletes a pénz szerepének megoldása. Fel kellett ugyanis váltani a lapeldobás mechanizmusát és ez kiválóra sikerült.

Jöjjön pár negatívum. Ha már a pénzzel fejeztem be, itt azzal is kezdem. Az új játékosok figyelmét érdekes módon nem hívja föl a szabály arra, hogy a pénz nagyon fontos a játékban, mert ha nem ügyelünk rá, akkor van esély, hogy több körig csak szenvedünk, míg valahogy újra nem teremtünk belőle többet mint egy. Ugyanis minden körben kapunk egyet, de ez csak egy kockával való dobást tesz lehetővé, ami biztos kudarc. Szóval elfért volna néhány tipp a szabály végén a kezdők számára. A játék nekem érzésre nem más, mint az előd. Azaz nem érezném úgy, hogy kell mindkettő, ha az egyik megvan. Bár a játék változatos, mégis egy full pasziánsz, így lehet sok játék után unalmassá válik. Pedig rengeteg lehetőség lett volna az interakció megteremtésére. Elég ha csak arra gondolok, hogy a saját fejlesztés táblák helyett közös lett volna. Szóval érdekes, hogy a nagy előd legnagyobb kritikáját, a pasziánsz jellegét ebben sem orvosolták. Mivel én szeretem az ilyet, engem nem zavar, de biztos sokakat igen. A téma nekem még annyira sem jön át, mint a kártyás változatban. Még annyit sem kell nézni a lapkákat, mint a testvérnél.

Összességében tetszett a játék, a jó kockás társasok között a helye. Kíváncsi vagyok, hogy jól érzem-e, hogy többen még jobb lehet, ha sikerül kipróbálni, akkor mondok rá végső ítéletet.

[2017-11-05]
Igaz, csak eggyel többen, de hárman játszva jobb a játék, talán 4-en még jobb lehet, mert sokkal több akció végrehajtódik, így a kockák elosztásakor megnövekvő időt a több akció kompenzálja. A szerencse azért erősebb, mint a kártyás változatban és lehet sajnos nagyon szerencsételenül is dobni. Marad a pontszám, de kb. bármikor kategória.

I feel like this game will always be viewed in comparison to Race, and I think that is appropriate. It offers a different take on the core design of Race, but everything it attempts to do, it does worse than its predecessor. The game isn't as intuitive despite adding text to the tiles and the dice, which are recycled over and over, lack the tough choices presented by having to discard the cards you use. The game is also significantly longer and more fiddly. While definitely not a bad game, it doesn't do anything I can't get better from Race.

Excellent dice heavy game about building an space empire. Race for the galaxy is a very polarizing game, Roll however is more enjoyable by all gamer groups from my experience.

Probably will be played among by 3 gaming groups alot and will have its life extended by the expansions. Game however is lacking decent player interaction.

UPside: Variability of tiles and dice rolling ensure replay-ability; dice make the game accessible to a broad audience

DOWNside: Roll is a nice game with interesting mechanisms, but as a spin-off of Race for the Galaxy it is natural to compare Roll with Race-and I find Race to be the superior design in just about every way (but all those colorful dice in Roll are pretty nifty)

Dice-Game adaption of race for the galaxy.

Great parts of Race for the Galaxy got lost in transition as the game never develops a real gameflow.

Also you are to focused with you own buisness, so you tend to miss, what your co-players are doing.

Still, a nice little game, but to expensive for and to bulky for its mechanics.

After a few plays, I'm enjoying it.  This one seems to provide the same kinds of satisfying engine-building dynamics as Race for the Galaxy while the iconography is a magnitude easier to absorb in Roll.

Dice! Custom dice! Custom color-coded dice! HUNDREDS OF CUSTOM COLOUR-CODED DICE WHERE THE THINGS THE DICE DO ARE THEMATICALLY INTEGRATED WITH THE GAME MECHANICS AHHHHHHHHHHHHH BEST.

I find this more thinky than Race, and the different strategies play out differently, because now it's not just about card flow, it's about cash flow. Gradual turn-by-turn assignment of workers to building tasks, ship after produce, and the need to *pay* to produce goods because goods are dice rather than cards you just get for free, are all hugely impactful changes. The little logic puzzle of "here are my dice, how do I rearrange them to get what I need" is delightfully satisfying.

Feels very much like Race for the Galaxy, but with a bit more luck, as you're rolling the dice. There are some reassignment actions which allow you to mitigate the luck, and the VP scoring is a little streamlined. It feels just a bit lighter and more of a casual fun experience than the original. Hard-core competitive players of the original will not be that excited about this game, but those that like variety and more fun will enjoy this one.

UPDATE: I also really enjoy the expansion, and think it's a very nice addition.

A very cool take on the ideas in Race for the Galaxy, but now with dice. This, though, is not just a twist on Yahtzee: the dice, with no reroll (but you can spend one to reallocate) are used in a great way to select actions and to power them. It still feels like Race, but plays faster and seems easier to get into for new players.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Players get a random starting setup: 1 home planet, 1 development and 1 world to build, and a set of dice based on that (plus 3 white dice). Each of the colored dice have a different distribution of faces, as indicated on the player aid.

Each round, players simultaneously roll their dice behind their screens. Place all dice in groups according to their face, then use any one of them to choose one of the 5 game actions (explore, develop, settle, trade/consume, produce). Reveal all dice, then resolve the actions in order.
- Explore: for each die, draw n+1 tiles (n=the number of unbuilt develop/settle tiles you have on your board that you choose to discard; all discards returned to bag at END of this phase). Each tile is double sided, with settlement on one side and development on the other. Choose which side you want, and put tiles at the bottom of the appropriate stacks.
- Develop: move all your develop dice to top development tile (which is finished when it has x dice on it; x=number on the tile)
- Settle: like develop, but for the settlement tile
- Trade: earn $2/die, or sell goods from planets (need a die on the world, and a sell die) for $3-6 (depends on type).
- Consume: use each die, matched with good, to earn VP; base 1VP + 1VP for each die matching the color of the planet where the good is coming from (so max 3VP)
- Produce: place each produce die on a settlement world, max 1 good/world

The game ends when someone has a total of 12 built worlds/settlements, or if the VP pile (starts with 12/player) is empty. Most VP wins!

This is officially my favorite dice version of another game.  I typically don't like dice versions of other games, especially games I already adore and I do adore Race for the Galaxy.  I like dice just fine but typically the way dice versions simplify mechanics of games into dice rolls is akin to surgery with a hatchet.  There are some I do enjoy though and this one was so completely well done.

This will feel very familiar if you have played Race for the Galaxy.  Each player has an income track as well as some number of developments or planets in their queue for researching or settling.  Players also have a prep area for dice as well as a dice cup.  Each round players will buy as many dice as they can/want to from their prep area into their cup, roll them, and assign them to actions.  One die each round can select any phase regardless of what side was rolled.  This guarantees that phase will be played.  The other dice have to go under the columns for the side rolled (with some exceptions such as powers from developments and planets).  So some dice may be wasted if they aren't under the phase you selected and no other player selected it either.

The phases are almost identical to normal Race.  Explore will get you new developments or planets into your queues or money.  Research assigns dice to a development, when it is fully researched it goes into your tableau and the dice are released to your prep area.  Same with settle and planets.  There are also produce and ship phases which put dice on planets as resources and sells them for money or points.  Even the end game is the same as normal Race.  12 tiles or all the VP chits are taken.

Not as good as Race for the galaxy! The dice and world illustrations are lovely but the other cardboard components are ugly. I find the way you put non-matching dice in the 'wrong' columns not very aesthetically pleasing and feel simply 'wrong'. Very fiddly and feels even more solitaire than race. Disappointing :(

I have played Race for the Galaxy a few times, and although I believe it is a more than decent design, I also found it incredibly confusing to play. Roll for the Galaxy, which in essence is a dice based implementation of the same game, does most of the same things, while at the same time being easier to wrap one's head around. That does not, however, mean that it is a game for beginners. It still has a lot of stuff going on, some of which seems difficult to explain to newer players. At the same time, it is a fun, fast played game that I expect will hit the table numerous times in the years to come.

All the action selection goodness in a short and easy to digest package. Lots of ways to manipulate your dice so randomness isn't really an issue in that regard. Seems like the key to optimizing is in paying attention to what your opponents' strategies are and playing off of that. 

Only major negative is in the tile draw. Sometimes bad draws can screw you over. Another minor complaint is that about 2/3 of the way through the game when strategies have been more of less solidified, it can sometimes feel like a slog to the finish. Do the same few actions over and over in order to trigger the end game. 

All in all, quick, easy, and oddly satisfying to play.

This is a great conversion of Race for the Galaxy to a dice game.  Not sure which one I like more but they are both fantastic.

Update: I definitly enjoy Race more, but Roll is still fun. Roll feels more random than Race, but I have no idea if that is true. That's just where my feelings land between the two.

What a great game!  Is it multiplayer solitaire?  Yes, totally.  But it is a perfect balance of acceptable luck (for a less-than 1 hour game) and mostly strategic play.  There is some tactical play, but generally your choices are based on a turn or two downstream.

Dropped by rating by a point since it's entirely possible for a player to get completely screwed by unlucky rolls and poor tile draws.  Especially in a 5 player game this can make the game drag on forever for that player as they watch everyone else race ahead.

Likewise it's even more possible that a single player will end up with incredibly synergistic tile draws that give them a lead which can never be slowed or caught.

Still a solid game that will remain in my collection for a while, just not quite as perfectly balanced as it appeared when we first played.

Innovativ dice mechanic. Never played Rce for the Galaxy, but after this one I dont miss that experience.
Its so fast and almost always everyone likes to start a second game right away.

RATING: 5
This reconfigures Race For The Galaxy to be easier to grasp conceptually by sacrificing that game's main strategy--deciding whether to use a card for its printed purpose or as payment for something else. What it doesn't fix is the basic "multiplayer solitaire" flaw.

RATING: 6
I'm sure it trivializes the development that went into this game to say that it is exactly like you would expect of Race for the Galaxy: the Dice Game.

As in Race, the core of the game is the set of turn phases. When a player rolls their dice, one can be used to choose any phase (which will occur for all players), while the rest must go against the symbol rolled and will activate only if one or more players has chosen that phase. Different coloured dice have different symbol distributions and also score bonus points if they colour-match on "consume" actions.

Watching opponents and leeching from their actions is required for good play in Race too, but the way dice are assigned here forces even beginners to pay attention. This contributes to a general feeling that the Roll is far more accessible than its forebear, which is notoriously hard on new players and I find toes the line of acceptable complexity. (It's much better with computer assistance than without.)

But the luck of the draw seems more pronounced, not to mention the luck of the dice. Worse, I don't get the same sense of depth that made Race such an achievement in design. 

Without the misfortune of being compared to its ancestor I'd probably just call it a good-but-not-great example of a type of game I dislike, but as it is it will always remind me of a better game I would rather be playing.

[RGG 14 Edition] {Space; dice-rolling, variable-phases; optimal 4p} I love Race for the Galaxy.  I like dice games.  I like space theme.  My buddies rated Roll for the Galaxy very high.  Roll for the Galaxy has all the things that I like but I was hesitated to buy it because I don't have much space left at home and it's quite expensive.  Recently, a FLGS is doing a good sale.  I got it then.

The production quality of this game is astonishing.  The dice and dice cups are wonderful.  I really miss RGG games.

Neat variant that doesn't really feel the same as the main game at all. My main problem is everything feels very samey. You don't get cool special abilities that you do in the original game.

Rolling dice is fun.  Rolling dice in a cup is extra fun.  The game and dice are all so colorful, it looks pretty.

Regarding the mechanics, there is quite a bit less luck than you might think from just rolling dice.  Each die has a slightly different action combo on each of its faces, so you can use that to weigh initial probability.  Then there is also a mechanic where you can set aside one die, which allows you to move another die to another action other than what the die face shows.  Then there are tiles you can buy to further change those odds.

Overall, it is a very fun building game.

This is a dice version of Race for the Galaxy.  There is much more randomness than in the card game.  The biggest difference is that the dice roll determines what phases you choose to do.  Also, the dice rolls determine how much you can put into building a development or settling a planet.  Overall, it gives the feel of Race for the Galaxy, but it does add some frustration when you don't get the rolls needed.  Sometimes, you end up not being able to do anything useful or productive for a couple of turns at a time.

RATING: 10
tl;dr: similar yet different

[thing=28143][/thing] has long been one of my favorites and it is my most played game by a huge margin. [thing=21632][/thing] is a dice game that I enjoy quite a bit from the same designer. So [person=150][/person] doing a dice game based on RFTG sounded promising.

I've already played the game twice now, and I've enjoyed both games. You can definitely recognize those RFTG genes in there but it's not a straight conversion. It does bring some new and interesting mechanisms with it. To does feel quite similar yet quite different at the same time.

It seems like there's less of a 'yellow strategy' or 'rebel strategy'. I think the main reason for that is that the amount of tiles that pass through your hands is significantly lower than the amount of cards you get to see in RFTG. So there is less planning and hoping and more using what you get to the best of your abilities.
I think the strategy in this game comes more from managing your dice. Certain colors are better for doing certain actions, so getting the balance right there while still building up a steady income stream to reuse your dice is what the game is all about.

I look forward to exploring this game more because it is clear that there is more there than 2 plays will expose.

A comment on the components: while generally of good quality (don't reach the German standard though) the dice are very cheap looking. Screen printed, really? If this game sees as much play as I hope it will, that will not do, the icons will fade quickly. I expect RGG to send me a free replacement set if that ever happens. The icons should have been embossed.

BGG scale: 7/10

I love worker placement games, and this is a game with multiple layers of just that.  It's a balancing act of sending workers to either get you more workers, currency to keep your workers active, locations, and trade to take multiple routes to victory!

Also, with the different options for players when it comes to starting locations, each game becomes a little different and the same tactic every time isn't always viable, making a game that requires a bit of thinking at all points.

More of a worker placement game than a dice game. The dice keep gameplay interesting, but it isn't a luckfest: the distribution of symbols differs with different type of dice and there are some ways to manipulate the dice if you had a really bad roll. interesting mechanics. Every turn you get to make important decisions: which dice to take back into your cup, which phase to select (while trying to guess what your opponents will select), which type of empire to build. Goal: build the most valuable (pointwise) galactic empire faster than your opponents. This is a game I truly enjoy, and I hope it has cleared the path for me to finally give Race for the Galaxy a try :-) But for now, I can't get enough of the dice :-)

My current favorite game. It has all of the elements that I love, researching and upgrading new technologies and abilities, exploring new worlds, and manipulating the mechanics to maximize your turn. Very fun.

Edit: After several plays, Some of the newness has wore off. Maybe I am missing something, but there is no interaction between players. I feel like I am just going through my motions to build stuff. I can't effect my opponents. Maybe thats why they call it "Race/Roll for the Galaxy". Still a good game, but don't overplay it or it may get old. At least it has for me at least right now.

Just like Alien Artifacts - from one side different than Race for the Galaxy, but yoy feel this is a dice variation of Race for the Galaxy. This game deserve to be a dice version of Race.

As a dice game different from other dice games (no re-roll).

Like that the starting world are 2 combined card, what give you a mini combo at the start. Just like in Race, you can later change your direction. Just like in Race you need keep a flow and you could asume what action need another player. 

I don`t have a problem with rolling the dice behind a screen. Sure you could cheat. But if you can`t trust your players don`t ply with them ANY game.

EDIT: Replaybility is not quit so huge like in Race for the Galaxy.

Much as Race: too much luck; too many icons and special condition. Too be sure, many people like this style of game. I'm iffy and this level of luck and complexity. The luck and special effects definitely make for a more manageable game than Race, but not quite to buy likability. Possibly after more plays. I still suspect a 6 development could choose the winner. In my second game, I won because I got cheap, high-vslue production worlds early--by luck; several turns I shipped for 6 VP and got $6 to buy my dice back.

A great game for casual to advanced players. Strict honesty is required. Produce - ship strategy is a bit weak for 3 players. Never gets boring. Really nice graphics. Expansion is also great but we dont use target tiles. We developed a house rule for a development card (3vp for 5+ settles, instead of 4).

It's like Race for the Galaxy, but much noisier! The main issue with Roll for the Galaxy is that beyond identifying what phases other players will want to activate, there's very little player interaction. So it really does mainly become a solo engine building exercise, where you're keeping on eye on others primarily to guess at what actions they want to execute, and whether they're close to ending the game. No better excuse to roll fistfuls of dice, though! For frequent players, though, it might be nice to get some felt or other padding for those plastic cups.

This is an interesting variation from Race for the Galaxy.  It feels less lucky than race because you don't have to worry as much about which cards you draw, although the starting abilities have a huge influence on the game.  I appreciate how fast it plays and don't really have any complaints.

RATING: 9
The dice system in this is brilliant, I'm not a massive fan of dice but dice collection with mitigation is great after playing Roll. As soon as it finishes I want to play again, and try and build my little empire of dice. I can't get over how well the dice collecting works. However, Race slightly beats Roll for me because of the stack in Roll. It limits options too much, and suuure there are ways around it, but only if you get lucky enough to find one of those tiles. Race gives you a hand of cards to choose from and burn, and while the stack initially seemed cool, it limits your options way too much. The tension of Race is in which cards to keep and which to burn for resources, and while that tension is somewhat replicated here with money management, it isn't as good. The dice however, make this game amazing, and perhaps if Roll had utilised an open stack, I may have liked it better.

Roll for the Galaxy is interesting, but has a Catch 22 problem. Here it is in a nutshell. The game can be very frustrating if you don't roll what you need. Now, there are special powers you can acquire through building developments and settling planets that can change die faces, giving you lots of options. However, once you are rolling seven, eight, nine or more dice and have the ability make red dice into X, and yellow dice into Y, and blue dice into any facing you choose, things get complex and turns start to bog down. And at that point it's no longer a light dice game. Which isn't a problem if you're willing to invest more than the advertised 45 minutes into the game. Not sure at this point if I am ...

This game is a keeper. It's not particularly a gateway game, since it's difficult to grasp, but once understood plays fairly easy and intuitive. It gets to the table regularly and serves as a nice round-up game or small filler game with play-time of about 30-45 minutes.

It does share the same vibe as its card-based brother -- unfortunately, that also includes the ridiculously esoteric iconography, the numerous exceptions written in tiny little text to keep track of, and the lack of any substantial player interaction.  I do think the game would be a decent amount of fun, though, if all players are expereinced enough to overcome the learning curve (and associated analysis paralysis).  

Plus, who doesn't like shaking dice in a plastic cup?  Nobody I want to game with, that's who.

I'm simply amazed how close it sticks to its older sibling. During gameplay I could have sworn I was playing Race for the galaxy as this game has just the same vibe and as such it is the best dice adaptation of a previously succesful board/card game title to date. So I'll be rating this just about the same as I rated Race. Which, at first, I rated a 10, but due to game-breaking or making combos in the beginning (especially when playing with veteran players) I downgraded the game and I don't know yet, if Roll is object to the same weakness.

Far too solitaire for me. Also requires a lot of moving pieces around, so it feels almost like work for me- there's absolutely no down time in this game, for better and for worse. Definitely the most over-rated, disappointing game I've ever purchased. There are some interesting variant ideas for more interaction, but I'm not sure that the constant 'upkeep' the game requires will fix this game's problems for me. It's a high energy game, and it feels like you just got your engine started and then the game ends (so the theme doesn't fit- it doesn't feel epic like I really am conquering the galaxy). Beautiful components and artwork, however, and great production values.

What a great dice game! And this is another game for the "I was wrong" files. I'm a huge fan of RftG, but this one just didn't look that good. Complicated dice? Rolling behind a screen? Sounds bad, but it all just works. You really have to play this to appreciate it.

Plus, I've been growing increasingly frustrated with the countless Yahtzee-style dice games, so this system of using dice feels really fresh. There are lots of decisions every turn, so you never feel like you lost just because of the dice.

RATING: 6
Get this and then you don't need any other dice games. (Except Sagrada. Get Sagrada.)

But seriously the mountain of dice you get is awesome. I always waffle on this game though. When it's fun, it's very fun. You get your engine going and you a rolling a ton of dice and doing everything you want thanks to your engine planning. It really feels like you're doing well when you have a bunch of dice in your cup too.

However, I have some serious issues with it as well. First off, teaching it is a nightmare. The symbols are fine but I rarely pick up a tile or look at my player card and think "oh, this is what that means." Add that to the fact that it is very easy to mess up/miss a rule/accidentally cheat and it makes just playing the game exhausting. And I thought I would have fun just rolling dice!

Next, I don't find the scoring to be satisfying at all. You ship and you can get money or points. You built a tile with a high number so you get points. And that's it. May be just me but I don't feel like my goal is exciting at all.

Finally, the actual dice allocation mechanic - the key part of the game - becomes an afterthought halfway through the game. Once you get a modest engine going, you have pretty much all the options you want every turn. And even if you don't, you've amassed so many dice that you can throw away any two to make any one you want. (That rule is pretty dumb, I think.) Predicting what phases are going to happen is the most exciting part, and even that has the air let out of it a little since if you predict wrong, the dice just go back in the cup, which is not really a big deal.

In all, it has some very good bits and some bad bits.

This is a fun engine builder, but it definitely lacks player interaction. It's basically multiplayer solitaire. The minimal downtime mitigates that somewhat though.

RATING: 7.5
First Impression:
Race for the Galaxy with dice and tiles instead of cards.

What I liked:
a) Everything that applies as a good thing in Race works in Roll as well. Sense of accomplishment, ease of play, important decisions both tactical and strategic, goals, variety, push your luck, fun, and quick gameplay.
b) Components wise, Roll feels much better and much more sturdy than Race. The tiles are plain better than cards, and the fact that they are double adds some nice balance and extra choices. The dice are also great as workers.
c) The game feels less fiddly than Race somehow. Using cards as resources always felt cheap in my eyes.
d) The new economy system is much cleaner, easier to explain and gives a better output, and thus sense of accomplishment than Race.

What I didn't like:
a) Same as in Race, the interaction is too mild for my taste. 
b) It's still a snowball game. Another player pulled out a better combo? You can see you're going to lose half way in and there is nothing you can do about it, even if you play better for the rest of the game.
c) There is a bit more randomness due to the dice rolling than Race, but still it's not much of an issue as you have more capabilities, you choose your dice and you have a lot of ways to make them anything you may want.
c) The major issue is that it is extremelly easy to cheat in this game. Turning a dice to another side is impossible to catch behind a player screen. Really, don't play this unless you can trust your opponents to play fairly.

Overall it's a better game than Race IF you play it with people you trust. People that won't - at the critical moment at the last round when they just can't build that 6 cost winning development because one white dice didn't roll develop (1/6 chance) - be tempted to just roll a die to it's side behind their screens and cry victory.

Roll for the Galaxy is hard game for me to review. It obviously shares a lot with Race for the Galaxy. So the real question for me is how is it different and would I prefer one over the other.

Before I get into that though... let's talk about the graphic design of the game. There's a lot of iconography in the game, some of which is the same as Race, but they did not do a good job of making the game comprehensible. The cheat sheet in particular is undecipherable until you start understanding the game. But even given that, there has to be a better way to display the information. I feel like this is a graphic design fail.

A lot of the game is the same. There are the same actions as RftG, but although some of them are implemented slightly differently, the overall feel is much the same. The main difference is that you have dice instead of cards. And different colored dice have different distributions of actions, most leaning towards a particular set of actions.

Everybody secretly rolls up whatever dice they were able to get into their cups. Then they assign them to whatever action is displayed. They can pick a die and use it to select the action that they want to guarantee will be performed this round. And it doesn't have to be the action shown on that die... so nobody is ever screwed out of an action they really want. And they can also use a die to force another die to be something else.

Finally, everybody reveals their dice. If someone selected an action and you have dice assigned to that action, they activate. Unused dice go back into the cup, used dice have to be repurchased for a buck each. I won't go into much about how the rest of the game differs from Race, as it isn't really material to understanding the differences in the games. It's this action selection mechanic that is really the primary difference.

So how you feel about Roll vs Race comes down to how you feel about the dice. First, let me say that while it seems that this introduces a lot of randomness in the game, everybody in my first game had a way to mitigate that. So in the end, you almost always could get your dice where you wanted. And since you can use one die to select the guaranteed action, you can always have at least one die on the action you want.

What I like about the dice is that it replaces a lot of the card fatigue you feel in Race... where you're constantly shuffling, cycling through cards, exploring through a ton of cards, etc. At times it feels like they said "You know, I love shuffling... I bet I could shoehorn a game into that somehow." The dice cut the card maintenance out of the game making it a lot easier to manage.

But what I like about Race is that the game comes down to picking the right action. You want to pick an action that will help you, without helping someone else, and hopefully also plan so that other people will be picking an action you need on a turn when you don't. There's kinda that same thing in Race, but it's not nearly as pure. Someone else can profit off your actions, not because they planned to, but simply because the dice ended up on the right symbol and they didn't have a way to change them to something else. And it's this distinction that really separates the two games for me and is why I prefer the original.

I like Roll for the Galaxy... but I prefer Race for the Galaxy. I'd probably want to play Roll every once in a while for something different, but most of the time I'd probably rather play Race.

[thing=132531][/thing] is, as many know, the little brother of [thing=28143][/thing]. And, as it happens in many of these case, the little brother is also much bigger, since the parents learned the tricks of raising a game and know that fooling around in dirt may actually be good for it, since it will develop better, thus being able to, being bigger, to conquer its space more easily when come the time for the little brother to leave the nest and explore the universe, taking just some goods with it in order to pay for some action. You know what I mean.

Anyway, [thing=132531][/thing] is indeed bigger: over 100 dice, cards turned into a lot of double-side tiles, players screens and boards, a dice bag, rules and plastics cups for dice rolling stravaganza and bothersome sound to the next table. No matter, I like the sound of the dice rolling and I will make some noise with it.

The game play sounds nearly the same: you choose one action and hope/foresee that the other will call some other actions you want to do. You do both by allocating dice to the actions you want to do - of course, as expected, you have to put them in the face showed after the roll, but you have some ways (and tiles) that allow you to change them from one place to the other. The dice you put in actions that weren't called, return to the cup.

The dice actually used serve basically as the cards in [thing=28143][/thing], but, again, not quite. If you put, say, three dice in the Explore action, you can use one to take a tile from the bag, another to draw other tile, and the third to gain +2 money. If you have 2 dice in the Develop action, you put both of them above the tile in the development area. If you have two dice in the Consume action, you can consume two goods, one for points and other for money, for example. The dice you put above the Develop tile and the World tile stay there, until there are enough dice to match the number required for them. Once this happen, the dice go to the citizenry area (a place in your board for the dice you have, that aren't inside your cup, being rolled).

Every round you can pay $1 for each die you want to take from your citizenry area to put it in your cup. More dice, more chances to do more actions, and also make one action A LOT. Card flow in this game became money/dice flow - you need to keep puting dice from the citizenry inside the cup, or you will may lose the timming of some important actions, and be left behind (much like being without cards in Race).

The game still ends when someone reachs twelve tiles in the personal tableau or when the vps chips end - however, now everyone starts with three tiles (one home planet, and two that represent your "race"). This might make you think: "So this game is faster, right?" No, it isn't. Between rolling the dice, allocating them, reassign them and having them locked in developments and in worlds, [thing=132531][/thing] takes longer to finish. Probably, as happenened with me, with Race, it will probably take less to finish plays with more experience, but I doubt it will ever be as fast as Race, but then, everyone knows usually running beats rolling when it comes to speed in a flat surface like a table.

[b]Ok, but it is better than Race?[/b] Well... No, for me, right now, it isn't. But I will add perspective: I played Race thousands of times, but, it took a while for me to like it at first. After my first play, I avoided it like it was the plague. I didn't understand a thing, someone had basically to play for me, and it was wasted minutes I never manage to get a refund. Once it cliked it was oh-my-god-this-is-great sort of advent. So it was a tall order for [thing=132531][/thing] to accomplish, and it failed in this matter. I found it to be fiddlier, slower and with some more luck added in (not only because of the dice, but also because of the way the tiles work - it is, indeed, awesome to have double-side tiles, so you will always get worlds and/or developments, but since you must put them in the board, the order you draw them matters a lot, as you might have to block, for the moment, something because you have to put the new tile bellow it). But this "luck" thing might just be because I know all the cards in Race, and know the ins and outs, and the same isn't true for Roll, however, I do miss the Explore+5 action, to actually look "deep" for something I truly want.

[b]And the positives?[/b] There are several. I mentioned already one of the big ones: double-sided tiles. Every tile you take have a world in one side and a development on the other. This is awesome! If you have and engine going for colonization, you know you will always find worlds (not necessarily good worlds, be in type or value, but, still, a world), and the same is valid for developments. [thing=132531][/thing] also seemed way easier to teach, mainly because you don't have anymore a Military bonus (military worlds and developments only give you red dice, which are good to colonize and develop), you don't have more windfall worlds (these worlds are still in the game, but they work as the other production worlds, except that they give a production die directly to the cup, and not the citinzery area), the Consume phase now is after the Production (makes easier to use goods), and you never have $0 in the game, so it is basically like ever having at least one card at the start of each round in Race (so Roll is more friendly). The production value is pretty good in [thing=132531][/thing]: the tiles are great, the cups are neat (and plastic doesn't smells bad like one known offender), the screens work pretty well, having some nice set of aids for the players. But I don't like the dice - I know engraving them would make the costs jump, but I don't like painted dice. I always get the feeling that the informations will peel off in no time - [thing=10640][/thing] made me like this.

[b]Will I play it?[/b] Of course. It is a good game, just not as good (so far) as [thing=28143][/thing]. I'm guessing [thing=132531][/thing] will reach a fine status alongside Race (and, of course, because being seen by some as a 2nd edition, it will get higher average ratings, which will help to keep the interest up for longer). And I like the sound of dice rolling inside a cup, so there is this.

I've played this once and really want to play it again. I unfortunately played this at a group gaming day with a guy who: picked up the rule book, declared he was going to teach us the game, then dropped the book on the floor. He did a crap job and I barely learned what to do, much less any strategy. I saw enough to know I want to play again - just maybe with my own normal crew.

Played most of a 2-player game solo to get the rules down

A lot is similar to Race for the Galaxy with a few notable exceptions (if you choose the action u don't get a bonus, etc)

The game was a lot of fun and I look forward to trying it out with a group of maybe 3-4 to start

Best dice game I have played I think

--------------------------------------

Tried a 3-player game with 2 others that have also played RFTG - one who has played it literally 100s of times.   Everyone agreed that this was more fun (at least with our limited plays)

The assigning dice mechanic is a lot of fun and the guys wanted to play 2 more games - back-to-back....a first for our group I think

Fast and fun and, so far, a real winner - hope for even more stuff in upcoming (hopefully) expansions

This really is an ideal medium weight game. I haven't given it a 10, because I don't think it's as accessible as Castles of Mad King Ludwig. Between the icons and the dice selection mechanic, there's just a lot that's not really intuitive. But it's a hell of a lot more intuitive than RftG. The integration of theme is really strong for the tiles the dice and the mechanic. And everything just flows really well once people understand how to play. Oh, and love the sound of a fistful of dice bouncing around in those cups!

Still deciding on this one after a few plays with two and three players. I think I was disappointed that the theme is completely meaningless; the art and text seem ridiculous to me. Something about it that makes me want to pull it out, but each play seems to run a little long and leave me a little flat.

Later: After a few more plays, maybe growing on us a little more than I expected. It's got a good pace to it; you feel almost constantly busy shuffling things around in a pleasing way. I no longer feel that it runs long. There are tiles and combos that can really sway the game if you're lucky enough to get them, so you can't take it too seriously. I like this game, but not sure why it gets as much love as it does. I still think the art is silly, not in a good way.

Later: This has stayed in fairly steady rotation. We added the expansion, which is good (not all of it, just the new dice and tiles). We like pulling it out, it's got a nice flow and feel to it.

Dull solitairish tableau builder, the only interactive mechanic often which is the role selection found in the original card game. The concept of reassigning dice as an ability is introduced here, but predictably this leads to hefty amounts of downtime as players spend too long fiddling away behind their screens.

RATING: 7
RftG has a restrained elegance for a dice chucking heavy game that almost felt like a Euro.  I really liked that the special abilities were not wildly overpowered or overly swingy, allowing quality play by participants to dictate the outcome.  Since I have only played it once it gets a 7 with a reserve to possibly score it higher if repeat plays make it live up to my initial impressions.

RATING: 7
Rating for a two player game - I can see how the game could become better with more players. My 12 year old son and I enjoyed the game, but after the first couple of turns, the game became a bit same-ish, and dragged on a little too long because of that. The most important decision you make each turn is which action to select, and with two players this decision really is not that interesting in and of itself.  The pool building is nice, as is the variety of planet and technology tiles, but I guess I would have preferred the game to play a little bit faster. As it stands, I clearly prefer to play the excellent Race For The Galaxy over this, even though I can see how Roll is more suitable for casual gamers.
UPDATE: Played with three and liked it, but for me the game lacks tension. Personally, I would never pick this game over Race.

Traded April 2017 for Formula D

Update: My initial impressions of this game were good, but I think I was swept up in the hype. My wife and I both prefer Race for the Galaxy over this one. 

The dice drew me in, but they're just too fiddly when combined with the player screens. The extra scoring mechanism for the shipping was a cool addition, but the game is not as intuitive as the reviews led me to believe.

I prefer Race because of the multi-use cards, which makes the game easier to teach and play, and in my experience a hell of a lot faster. The icons are tough at first, but with player aid in hand it shouldn't be a problem. No different than any other game.

Initial impressions: Simplifies a more difficult card game. Easier to grasp and play.

It's a proper game. Not sure tho, why is it so hyped. It's a good worker placement game with some strategy in it. Also, predicting your opponent moves is crucial in this game. It can be fun, but there is almost no emotions. This game is based on a pure math, with predicting what your opponent will do. Rounds are quick, players are doing their turns at the same time. Game itself is also pretty quick, so you can play it few times in a row, with not losing so much time on it.

 Game is oriented around dices(Hence, it's called ROLL for the galaxy, duh) but it's not really random, because 6 sided dices usually have 2-3 same symbols on it, and almost all of them have a wild card symbol on it(some of them even more than one), and you can also choose a dices with symbols you preffer most. And even then, if you somehow didn't manage to get what you want, there's always an option to change your roll value to whatever you like at the cost of one dice(which you can still use it on the next round, with no penalty).

During the game we will also draw a lot of tiles with planets and technology on it, which happens to be very important for the gameplay. We will try to explore the planets, and study the technology. Those will give us very important victory points in the end, and will also have impact on our gameplay, because they have different mechanics, and will help us in different ways, so it's very important to create a somewhat reliable "engine".
 Because we're drawing tiles randomly, we will need some luck to get what we want. It's pretty easy to screw everything up, if we're not paying attention on what we're doing. Luckily there is always a way to replace unfinished tiles to other, random ones, even few of them at once.

I'm not making problems, if someone want to play it with me, but i can only play  this game max one, maybe two times, depends on the mood.  After that, game can be quite boring, because there's almost no interaction between players. Everyone is playing  their own game, making their own goals, with bigger one at the end of the game, which is counting victory points. Mechanic itself is good, but game's lacking some interaction, mostly negative one between players. Game is pretty popular, so maybe one day we will receive an expansion that will fix this problem. But if you love cold math, with predicting what your opponents will do, and you don't really like waiting for other players turn, you might like this game.
 And when you done playing, then you can use those nice looking cups, to drink something colorful. Like those cups.

RATING: 5
This was cute. It was playing a dice game which isn't a variation on Yahtzee but there are flaws in this design. The fact that it's not guaranteed that a particular action will occur makes this quite chaotic. An opponent may want to settle but just hope that someone else is. Or their dice simply don't allow them to settle. That's a bit of an issue. 

I'd like to play this game again, and it was definitely more enjoyable than Race for the Galaxy. Custom dice are cool.

RATING: 8
This is an easy game to pick up with a lot of potential for depth. It's fantastic!

I've played Race for the Galaxy as well. This game's components are far superior. The play is slightly more intuitive, and overall it fells like an improvement on Race. I will admit, that Race had a bit more depth to it.

The big difference is that you simply get more control over what you choose to build in Race for the Galaxy whereas that choice is much more limited in Roll. In effect, I'd say that Roll is much more tactical (what can I do *this* turn), whereas Race is much more strategic (what can I do to setup a good end game).

RATING: 9.9
This game quickly entered my top 10. As expected, it provides a similar feel to Race for the Galaxy, but the dice mechanics smooth out the card flow economy experience. The game has a variety of mechanics to help mitigate luck (e.g. "dictate" and "reassign" powers), so getting the dice to do what you need is more strategy than luck. An immense amount of replay value is derived from the variety of starting combinations of Home World and Faction tiles. In addition, the number of tiles available in the bag is deep enough that you are unlikely to see the same combination of tiles twice. Another fantastic point to Roll is that the reduction in iconography (or rather, the text description of all abilities) makes the game a bit easier to teach than Race.

Amazing game - Race wins for me just for speed of play and comfort, but both are fantastic! Roll wins for new players though.

Another controversial point - lack of downtime outside of the Explore phase! It makes the game super quick, but can make it feel like solitaire.

The iconography is easy to learn. Game plays 2-5, and scales really really well because phases are played simultaneously. One of the very few complaints about Roll for the Galaxy is sometimes the game ends abruptly right before you can get your engine really going. I don't feel this is necessarily an engine builder, its more like... a rhythm builder

I really like this game. I like dice chucking, I like engine/tableau-building, and the mix-n-matchability of this plus the expansion makes each game a bit different. Colorful, solid components, easy set up and tear down means its fun to pull out and play when you're in the mood. Some people would say they dislike the lack of player interaction, but for me player interaction often includes a lot of "take that" options, which I don't prefer, so this works for me.

No active messing with opponents things but watching them to predict what actions they might prioritize makes it so it isn't a completely solo game. Even had it been a solo game, the combinations and decision making process to avoid wasting any dice actions by not being able to buy back everything or by not having good build options or having dice locked up in goods/waiting to finish a big building project makes this game extremely appealing to me.  The race aspect of the name is all too true.  You have to be efficient in every decision and often can benefit by giving up on a given project rather than delaying and trying to force the completion.

Excellent game! First game in a long time that got me into the obsessive "must play more" mindset. Loved Race for the Galaxy in every way and this is the perfect sequel to the series, preserving theme, feel and some basic mechanics but still manages to transform into something that feels fresh. Especially love the partially recycled and same style artwork as it connects this game with Race for the Galaxy and makes it feel familiar and connected to the story. If this proves to be balanced and varying enough in the long run it will be a 10.

Lots of variability and fun to figure out what your strategy is based on your starting tiles and initial tile draws and then "race" to the finish!

I understood the rules, but there's much in mechanics and tactics, that I'd need to learn in order to play this well. I guess this is quite similar to the Race for the Galaxy, but with dice.

I find Race For The Galaxy as a great game. It is one of the best game ever, great and innovative mechanics in tableau building and role selection.
But honestly I suck at it and surely I would hate the game if I continue to play and suck at it. And there it is, the dice version of the game and I like it very much. Lots of dice, but not as random as luck of the draw in Race For The Galaxy.

Great game with a surprisingly steep learning curve. The game really loves using icons in order to keep things shortened, but doesn't do much to explain them without the rulebook. As a result, expect the game's explanation to go on for a while. After getting past the fiddly rules and icons, however, the game is a solid and really great experience. Just don't try playing it at night. Hint: Multiple people shaking cans of 5+ dice each.

RATING: 5
Better than the awful Race For The Galaxy, having been cleaned up and streamlined avoiding the horrible mess of incomprehensible icons. Still primarily a puzzle with random tile draws and dice rolls replacing the random card draws and the same minimal interaction of slightly extended rock-paper-scissors guesswork.

RATING: 9
Good dice game that moves quickly with players who know the rules. Elements of luck are involved so it's not completely cut-and-dry-"fair" but still a lot of fun and enough die manipulation to mitigate luck and make this a great strategy game. Probably one of my favorite dice games so far.

While I've played Race quite a bit and have respect for it, it's never been a personal favorite because I don't particularly care for games where the depth comes from high amounts of information to absorb rather than the intricacies of player interaction. Not that Race is entirely multiplayer solitaire, or even Roll for that matter, but these games are definitely too self-absorbed for my taste (I've come to be wary of any game with a personal tableau).

I give credit to Roll for being a clever dice implementation of the card game, but in practice it felt like more of the same and very monotonous. In sum, geeking out on dice roll odds (or card draw odds) isn't really my thing- I much prefer my opponents' decisions to be the main challenge I'm grappling with.

RATING: 6
I thought because I love Race for the Galaxy that I would love Roll. That isn't the case. Roll seems a lot more fiddly. The mechanics are similar but there is enough different to make them feel different as well. They took away the bonuses for role selection which is something I liked about Race. The planets and technologies seem less diverse. I would much rather play Race. This game is just very "okay".

I have to give them credit for taking the basic design of Race for the Galaxy and distilling it down to a dice game.  There are a lot of cross-incentives going on to keep you having to make choices, and there are a lot of rules that allow you to work around the luck of the dice, or at least manage your odds a bit better.  The game spent a long time in development, and the end result is fairly polished.  I just have to wonder if, once the novelty of playing Race for the Galaxy with dice wears off, I'll choose to play this over Race for the Galaxy.

For me personally Race for the Galaxy >> Roll for the Galaxy. The best thing about Race for the Galaxy is the engine building aspect - Roll for the galaxy makes that inferior by adding dice to it thereby reducing your control over it. What's the point of building an engine if you can't control it when you want! It is not that I don't like games that are luck-driven but Roll feels like its neither here nor there.

Roll for the Galaxy replicates Race for the Galaxy almost exactly, except it uses dice instead of cards. Despite the randomness inherent in die rolling, it does seem like Roll is "easier" due to the amount of luck mitigation built into the system, something that is not found in Race for the Galaxies card mechanics.

I have heard some people say that you can make a value judgement on the two games based on your preference of difficulty level. I'm not so sure, because this game is quite fun, regardless of the existence of Race for the Galaxy. Personally, I think there is room for both.

A version of Race better suited to occasional play. Developments and worlds do not also serve as currency, which means you see fewer of them throughout the game. So less to learn but at the cost of never having to decide whether it is worth spending cards you might otherwise play just to get your engine started a bit earlier.

This also has special rules for two player, but unlike Race, they are not very good.

Took a few 'rounds' of the dice for the mechanics to click for me.  Certainly a good bit of fun optimizing your dice, but doesn't have a lot of player interaction.  You can easily paint yourself in a corner and have to choose a particular option and find yourself hoping someone else will choose certain other options so your other dice won't be wasted.  Jury is still out on this one for me, but definitely want to try it again.

If you love the cardgame, you definitly are going to love the boardgame. It plays very familiar and yet the gamemechanic gives a completely new feel. You roll dice and with the result you try to make the best out of your options. There's only one thing that kind of bothers me a bit. The startingtiles -that provide you with points- can make the difference in winning or losing the session. Several times already the difference between the winner and number two was the difference in points printed on the starting planets. So I often wonder why they didn't choose for startingtiles with the same value ... or at least with less difference. We had games were I started of with 7 points and my wife with 2 points and I finally won with the same 5 point gap. It doesn't feel all that fair. Otherwise a wonderful game, don't get me wrong!

RATING: 7
Allocating dice is a lot of fun, and because of the way exploration works (you can give back any number of tiles to get something else instead) you have way more tools to control luck of the draw. Because of these this is a total Race For The Galaxy killer. But it's a very solitaire game, you sometimes look up to see what your opponent might select or if the game is ending this turn or not, and just like in race, I feel most of the time it's obvious which tiles I want and the game is a bit too much about 6+ tiles. It's enjoyable, but it's not that great when you think about it.

RATING: 7.5
I've never owned, nor played the card game version so I have not basis for comparison.  But as a dice roller, I consider this one a "solid 7".  It has relatively easy rules, is easy to teach, plays fast, but has plenty of choices without being slave to the roll of the dice.  Mostly a multi-player solo style game but you do need to anticipate what actions other players may take that will benefit you.

Never played Race for the Galaxy, so there was a bit of a learning curve; rules aren't complex, but maybe a bit unintuitive. Once learned, it's quite fun with nice strategic and tactical elements in a quick playtime.

Nice experience. After thousands of Race games, this is a breath of fresh air. The game feels more thematic, mainly because you try to manage your population (dice workers). However, dice represent a population of billion of people across the galaxy, so it's not an easy task to set up an efficient supply chain. You need to pay attention to what other people do.

RATING: 8
I very much enjoy this game, it has a great dice allocation mechanism and it's different enough from Race for the Galaxy to justify its own existence. But I have to say that it doesn't offer as many interesting decisions and "meat" (I guess it's because Roll for the Galaxy is more focused on dice management and luck mitigation rather than combo building - and I prefer the latter).  

The game is streamlined  in some areas, but contains some new aspects that initially might be just as confusing as the infamous "Race iconography" so I wouldn't neccessarily call Roll that much more "user friendly". Also, Race plays quicker, smoother and eats less table space.  

I watched and read many reviews saying that Roll completely replaces Race, but it doesn't (at least not for me). If you want a nicer looking, more inviting game then yes, go with Roll. But if all you care for is the rich, deep gameplay experience definitely stick to Race - it has less luck and gives you much more control. There's time and place for both games, but I would pick Race over Roll every time.

Roll for the Galaxy adds a very minimal overhead compared to Race for the Galaxy and offers almost identical game experience in terms of decision making; but only Roll ftG gives an enormously satisfying experience of rolling tons of dice!!

Doesn't really feel like a dice game.

More interactive than the original game because you really have to predict what others are going to do or get shut out.

Also, waaay more newbie friendly, as there are still icons, but planet/development powers are also described in writing on the card.  So, no more frantic passing of the icon sheets.

After a few plays I feel this game is on par with Roll for the Galaxy. Some responsibilities have been transferred from cards to dice which in turn changes some of the mechanics and powers; for example the color of the die often matters, not just the type of worker it is. Assigning the dice (workers) is entirely new and fun aspect of the game and there are even powers that allow flexibility to the assignments.

It's very difficult for me to judge this title. I HATE games when it is possible to cheat behind a screen and I could go at length on the reasons why. So this for me starts very low. But RftG has a wonderful rhythm, nice mechanics and very good components. I can't and I don't want to keep track of what is happening with my opponents, i just go with the flow,  and my very first to games ended after a very short time. There are different ways to win but I find it difficult to plan... there are no "paths to the victory", more than strategic planning it seems to me a drifting toward the end. The nice decision is more a tactical one than a strategic one, "what can i do with these dice now?". There is too much luck in the planet tiles you explore and even if you want to go for a certain strategy you are stuck to develo/settle what you get from the bag.
All in all, a rather fun game but not a good game, at least for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
If you like Race for the Galaxy, but think it's a bit too predictable with your hand of (random) cards, then you should try out Roll for the Galaxy. The hidden information in this game are the dice (instead of the cards) and those dice depict the available options you have when deciding what action to do: explore, develop, settle, produce, or ship. Happily, consume/trade is now just ship and you can either trade goods for money or earn points [b]and[/b] it happens after produce. I like how the tiles (cards?) that you're developing and settling are gained in the explore phase and that you're placing dice on those cards over the course of multiple turns (or in one if you can manage it).

This game is on my Want to Buy list and I'll probably add it to my Christmas wishlist this year.

I have played this game twice now, and I am still not sure I understand the strategy of the game, but it is a lot of fun. Players roll dice simultaneously and place them on the types of actions they would like to take. Actions can provide income or help to expand a players empire with new worlds or technologies. Each world or technology provides new types of dice or different end scoring conditions for the player possessing them. The downside is that with all of the iconography and options it can be difficult to explain. This is a good game for gamers who can relate the rules to other mechanisms, but I don't think I would try to teach it to my family.

Although I love Race for the Galaxy, I had dismissed this game entirely when I first heard about it, because I'm not a fan of dice games. Incredibly, when I did get a chance to play someone else's copy, I was impressed by how much it maintains the flavor of the card game. Not only that, it's easier to teach. I would definitely pull this game out instead of Race when introducing it to new players.

This is more than just a dice version of the classic that we played for so many hours. Although the crap ton of colored dice gave me Quarrior flashbacks.  It is still mostly a fun multi-player solitaire that introduces some very interesting game mechanics. Splitting the game into dice and tiles seems to make the game concepts easier to explain and grasp to new players. I like the luck mitigation options to fix your bad dice rolls. Managing the stack of planets and developments is an interesting strategy mechanic that I'm still getting the hang of. The one thing that I don't like is games that are played behind player screens. We have ours at our side for reference. We aren't that competitive to spy on how the other players are placing their dice actions...mostly we don't spy. This will replace my card version of the game. I like the simultaneous play works for five players and still get in a whole game under 90 minutes.

Pretty light, fast and fun. If it can be called a dice game, its one of my favorite dice games - and its a great game for non-gamers. The aspect of reading what actions the other players will pick gave the game the depth it needed for me. It also felt like you never was screwed by the dice since you could find alternative routes to success. The downside could be that players can cheat very easily, but since its just meant to be a fun, light game it wont be a problem - and I trust my fellow players.

I absolutely despise this game. Full disclosure I play nearly every game with only one other player and this game does use a variant in which a third action is randomly chosen by a "robot" player. In general I dislike games which do this but I don't find it that intrusive in this particular gameIn my opinion that does not reflect why I dislike it so much. I don't like this game for one very specific reason. It is a dice game where what you roll basically doesn't matter at a certain point. I understand balancing to make luck be a lesser deciding factor in games but this is overturned in my opinion. When the game really ramps up in the few times I played it I was rolling so many dice that I could easily do whatever I wanted. I'm sure that is appealing to some but to me it simply means that I make no meaningful choices. I really wanted to like this game is what really bothered me. The dice look cool, is never played race for the galaxy and heard this was more streamlined so I thought the more streamlined version of a game so many love sounds right up my alley. I could not have been more wrong. Retired this game about a week after it arrived at my house.

Quick spin-off of Race for the Galaxy.  Surprisingly, the dice don't add that much randomness, as there are ways to mitigate the rolls.  About an hour per game, once everyone knows the rules.

If you've never seen the movie [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0]Powers of Ten[/url], it goes like this:

We start with a microbe, which is better than RFTG.

Then we move up to a hair on a man's head, which is better than RFTG.

Then - pulling away for a loftier view - we continue our mathematical journey of magnification through the house and city levels and work our way up to continents, planets, the Milky Way, and finally the universe itself. 

And as you pause and reflect at each power of ten, be sure to recall that whatever you are looking at is better than RFTG.

Wow, what a brilliant, brilliant dice-rolling game. The base game has 111 dice -- ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN! 

Each color dice is 'weighted' and is more likely to roll Explore, or Shipping, or Deleopment, etc. so depending on what you're most trying to accomplish will impact what dice you purchase for the next round.

Unfortunately, the theme isn't as appealing to my bride as some others, so it isn't hitting the table as often as I'd like. Fortunately, I do have some other gaming friends who are always up for a game of Roll ftG.

Personal favorite player count is 3, but 4-5 still work they're just not as intense because practically every action is always selected. 

It's a bit easier to teach than Race, and arguably more fun for someone not after the dual hand managing craziness that is Race.

If I had one gripe it would be the noise of the cups + dice.

The only real player interaction is the action phase,  which would be fine if I was able to be more engaged with what I'm building,  but my personal building space didn't offer enpugh interesting decisions for me.  Traded after a bunch of plays trying to see what all the fuss was about. Good design for sure,  but not interesting enough for me to want to own.

Traded for punched but never played copy of De Vulgari Eloquentia in a math trade.

Has the strategy and fun of Race for the Galaxy, without needing to memorize pages of symbols.  A significant improvement, easier to play, and incredibly easier to teach.

Extremely fun dice euro.  Some of the best of Fresco meets some of the best of Alien Frontiers.  Light dice engine building that gets you into the action immediately.

This is a strong 7.5 right now. I really enjoyed the first couple of plays but I need a ton more to really wrap my head around it. Played fairly quickly at 4 and 5 players even with people learning the rules. It feels a little more flexible than RFTG because you can Dictate right out of the gate as well as select a phase with a non-matching face. Once everyone is familiar with the phases, I could see most games finishing up in around 25-35 minutes which is a great time in my opinion.

So many dice!  Understanding how dice are assigned can be bit tricky at first, but once you get the hang of it, then it just becomes a matter of deciding what you want to do.  After 4-5 plays the game really sped up, and we can now finish in about 30 minutes.  Rolling all the dice is super fun, as is trying to race other players based on the strategies they go after. My wife and I have had some really close games with this one.

great game, with race for the galaxy as a great template they build a system that is a bit more player friendly.

This time they used symbols and text. This helps the players.

A 2-5 dice based Euro game. Players roll their dice and use them to select their action for the round and execute that action, but they also do all the actions the other players select. Players build their system, produce and ship goods, and compete to get the most victory points.

I never played Race for the Galaxy but I refuse to believe that it can be better than Roll. This game is incredible. Seeing all the dice on the table brings out your inner kid, urging you to touch and play with them. The fact that the mechanisms on top of that are pretty excellent too make this one of my favorite game.

Simpler and streamlined version of Race for the Galaxy. A lot fewer icons and every tile has explanation text. There is more to do on every turn and you have a construction queue to always remind you what you're going for. It takes a little time to know how to keep your cup full of dice. Overall good game, though maybe not better than Race for the Galaxy.

Okay, right off the bat, the player shields in this game remind me the hell out of the Dicemaster logo used by ICE in 1996. However, this is a tremendous game.

I love role selection, figuring out what actions the other players will select is so much fun to me. Setup and teardown seem much simpler and quicker here than in Race for the Galaxy, but I love how in the latter the cards are also your resources to pay to play said cards. Right now I like both games quite a bit.

Family loves this more than I do, but I don't mind repeated playings for them. Low player interaction. Simultaneous actions keep the game flowing quickly. Blue/Purple dice are difficult for colorblind to distinguish, but not a game breaking issue.

I wasn't all that interested in Roll as Race didn't have much staying power for me... but I walked right to the counter and bought my own copy after getting a chance to play on a friend's copy.  Its unique these days for a dice game not to use the Yatzee mechanic and I really like how dice allocation works in Roll.  Also the text on the tiles minimalizes the barrier to entry for new players compared to Race which is nice.  In my first game the multi-player solitaire feel was very strong, but I'm hoping with more plays and particularly if I play with less than 5 people I will be able to keep track of other player's strategies more easily.  

I'm quickly coming to appreciate this as an accessible tableau building game someplace between a filler and a lighter Euro.  Should get a lot more play unless the "shiny" wears off too fast and I start being annoyed by the strong multi-player solitaire vibe.

Rywalizacja, budowanie imperium z DUŻĄ ilością kostek jako zasobami. Gracze: 2-5 os. Tłumaczenie: średnio krótkie. Wymagania: analityczność, czytanie po angielsku (choć tłumaczyć może inny gracz). Czas: 1h + 0.5h per osoba.

Bez negatywnej interakcji, spokojna jak pasjans, ale bardzo miły aspekt zbierania kostek i turlania ich. Brak downtime'u.

RATING: 4.5
Sorry, played twice now and I still didn't like it. Roll dice; assign it to potential single role selection and you may get other actions if other people choose them.

No direct player interaction, blocking only occurs if you know the game so well that you know player X will do Y, but if you're new to it then you will find its not very clear what actions do, let alone if they are any good to you or are worth attempting to block. Its all a solitare affair. 

Also, I have no idea if I'm doing things right, you end up repeating 3-4 main actions each time witb no real payoff. I find this game dull.

The extravagant dice maneuvering feels excessive but it does a good job of mitigating what I'd expected would be atrocious lucky-roll poisoning.  It's reasonably fun.

(Note, I'm a huge Race or the Galaxy fan, having played it many hundreds of times. This obviously impacts my thinking on Roll for the Galaxy)

After 10+ Plays: I've enjoyed playing this, but it hasn't grabbed me the way Race does.  I think what's holding it back a bit is the flow of resources.  In Race the cardflow seems pretty intuitive in its operation, and thus you can focus on building an engine.  In Roll, the diceflow is a bit clunky, and I think too much effort is expended just making sure you don't paint yourself into a corner where you end the turn with almost no dice in the cup.  I'll probably continue to play it, but it's never going to be in the same league as its cousin.

Build up a galactic civilisation using a selection of dice as your workers. it's a bit awkward to learn at first and not all that deep, but the wide array of planets to settle and technologies to research can lead to some interesting combinations and powers.

I'm gonna be honest, the many custom dice play a big role in this rating. I do really love games that have you roll dice then have you do something with them (see also: Alien Frontiers). There are a lot of games that have you do something, then roll to resolve, which is often really unsatisfying. But using a random element to force you to be flexible is really cool, and there are tons of ways to mitigate that random element. That change alone puts it over Race, though I haven't played enough Race to get super good at it.

RATING: 8
Didn't get on with Race for the Galaxy at all, but I found this much more enjoyable - in every way. There's an amount of trying to second guess what your opponents are going to do so you can best capitalise on that action, but limited interaction beyond that.  However, the remainder of the game is quick, interesting and allows for a few different strategies to gain points (as well as the 'do I push to end the game or do I wait another turn or two to try to ensure I'm in the lead'). It is possible to cheat as dice are rolled behind your screen, but what can be done about that - just don't cheat, douche.

I'm very intrigued to see what expansions might bring - some hidden objectives and some more interaction would catapult this even further.

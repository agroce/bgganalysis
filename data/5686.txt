Best SCIFI Infantry game out there

RATING: 8
It has a couple of issues, but it's still probably my favourite miniatures game. My web site has house rules, and a playtest version of the Phalon rules (written by me).

RATING: 8
My only negative would be that there is very little difference in the characterization of wildly different direct fire weapons, say plasma vs slug thrower.

platoon level hard sci-fi infantry game that is command and control orientated, it's a game that is best taught in order to understand the mechanics.  Though once you've got even 1 or 2 games under your belt you'll be teaching others without trouble.  Excellent

This is the best tactical squad level miniature game on the market hands down.  It's chartless and has hardly any bookeeping.  It has squad based movement, supression, mines, wounded, smoke, morale, troop quality, air operations, artillery, crewed weapons, AFV's, snipers, medics, etc., etc., etc.   If it sounds complicated, it's not.  It gives stunningly accurate reactions of small units on a modern/future battlefield.  I can's priase this game enough.  It uses different die types to simulate troop quality that directly impacts the effectiveness of the troops.  This is squad vs. squad combat, you don't get bogged down rolling tons of dice for each model.  It's also an opposed die roll system, where players take turns moving squads so there is never any down time.   It rewards using real life fire and move tactics.  It's totally generic rules system, so take your favorite minis and background and plug and play.  There is a line of excellent miniatures they produce, but they are by no means nessacary to play the game.  I'd rate this one higher if I could.  It beats the pants off of anything similar on the market.

Pretty good set of miniature skirmish rules, though they feel a little archaic nowadays.

I have an extra copy of the rulebook.

Much nicer than Dirtside II. No longer uses the chit-pulling system. The rebellion against a point system is nice too. Overall, one of the cooler hard scifi games out there.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Best set of hardcore sci fi miniatures rules out there, may be a little too realistic in approach for some players. Basically contemporary military taken into future, realistic, but maybe thats what would put some people off who are more used to say warhammer 40k etc.

inventive, but too incomplete for most miniature wargamers to get into.

Near perfect minis game for small unit, gritty tactical action. Too bad I don't have the time to devote to a minis game.

RATING: 7
Interesting rules for SF combat in 25mm.  Is very enjoyable to read, which is a change from most miniature rules sets.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A very gritty, very hard, sci-fi miniatures rules set.  In many ways it's the anti- Warhammer 40k.  This is a game all about terrain, suppression, and morale.

RATING: N/A
I have Dirtside II and like it based on my read of the rules, but 1:300/1:285 miniatures seem pretty scarce.  15mm are a lot more common (and I could proxy my FoW minis), so I'm interested in getting this game.

One of the truly great miniature games. Elegant combat mechanics and still one of the best depictions of squad based combat out there.

This was the Ground Zero Games attempt to design a ground warfare Sci-Fi title. The system was good if not a bit complex for the time period. I still have my copy but in the last twenty years other systems have left this title in the dust.

Once you get the rules this becomes a great game. Very nice feel to the outcome etc.

I play with 15mm and leave the ranges as published. Makes for a very fun game.

good sci-fi small scale action game. pros: tense and elegant unit activation system. realistic hug the dirt rules instead of advancing through a hail of steel. cons: no aliens. no point system. a bit slow.

Classic sci-fi wargame.  Has all the right elements and excellent (IMHO)rulebook.

RATING: 9
This is by far the best scifi wargame I've ever played.  Stargrunt II has plenty of tactical options, command and control acutally means something, and morale is important.  How you play is more important than what you field, which is rare in miniature games these days. There are no weird "cartoony" things going on (something far too common in scifi games these days). And most importantly, it's fun to play. Highly recommended.

I didn't like Stargrunt II very much - the way it goes about modelling squads (which are really the key maneuver units, rather than individual models) didn't click with me and I wasn't any more impressed with its combat model (which counts rifles to a certain point and then suddenly stops counting and pretends 4 gauss rifles are as good as it ever gets).

Absolutely the best sci-fi small unit tactical game out there, bar none. Be forwarned, you will have to use real unit tactics to succeed - you can't just go out and buy the latest over-priced hyper-model (as in some rulesets). SGII makes you think, and act, like there are real soldiers under your command - the morale, motivation, and slowly degradable qualities of each unit force you to make sound tactical decisons. Activations are key. The rules are loaded with extras, and do not require you to rigidly adhere to one world-view or rule interp. The only negative, a small one, is the alternating unit sequnce - it's effective, but I prefer a little more random surprise (personal preference). It also lacks aliens, for the moment, but several unofficial alien modules are on the web. All in all, great sci-fi miniatures system.

RATING: 8
Excellent squad level skirmish game.  The system works well but breaks down in the face of exotic races or equipment.  Despite its sci-fi theme it's far more applicable as a modern system.

One of the best sci-fi rules, good system of play. Maybe too many counters following the units. Excellent range of figures from the same company (Ground Zero Games).

Great squad-level sci-fi rules. Cover, suppression fire and morale are very important here.

They do a lot right with this game with the basic mechanics.  Close combat is a bit weird, and can have some strange effects on the game scale as the amount of ground that is possible to be covered is huge.  Not so much a fan of the more advanced options -- vehicles, support artillery, etc, but the game shines as a simple skirmish game with a small number of squads per side.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The ruleset and the system is excellent. The default setting is not appealing and incredibly outdated. The setting itself is in my opinion the main obstacle for a greater diffusion of this great game.

I haven't had the chance to play this yet, but I do have a stack of painted 15mm minis from my Laserburn days that are screaming to be used with this system... ;¬)

RATING: 7
Considered a fine tabletop sci-fi miniatures game by long-time players of this game type, Stargrunt II excels in its fine use of scale (often absent from other miniatures games other than historical), off-table use of artillery, air/space support and the like, and its immediate applicability to any line of miniatures, to any type of sci-fi milieu. Unfortunately, it's out of print (such is the fate of good sci-fi miniatures gaming--it seems most players of such games would rather be spoon-fed...).

Our group failed this one on the over-reliance on morale - it was just a bit much.  Otherwise an okay ruleset.

Excellent and very detailed rules for platoon to company level combat (at maximum size).  Close combat and vehicle rules start getting a little too complex for my tastes at certain levels but the rest of the game is spot on IMO.  As simple or as bell and whistley as you want depending on the options you choose.

RATING: 8
Don't let the generic label fool you.  This is a FMA (Full Metal Anorak) System game with great INTERACTIVE play sequence.  The generic is that it can be adapted to most any background (I have done a Star Fleet Battles Ground Combat to SGII/DSII conversion).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
These are, IMHO, probably the best sci fi (or modern era...) mini rules available.  Excellent C&C rules & integrated turn sequence make for a smooth flowing game.  One noticeable omission is a lack of points system for balancing forces (This could be good or bad, depending on your point of view).     The only thing keeping me from giving it a "10" are the lack of detailed TO&E for the various factions.

RATING: 9
As good as Dirtside II is, Stargrunt manages to take its strengths and blow you away.

The ONLY reason this game doesn't get a 10 from me is that A) I don't really do ground combat games that much, and B) I'm stuck in a place where the only ground combat SF games are Warhammer and MechyClixCrack.  The morale and unit systems are simply beautiful in their gritty elegance and attention to detail.

For squad/platoon/company gaming of a mainly infantry/specialist nature in hard sci-fi setting, these are by far the best rules for me. In fact, these have ended up being adapted/simplified to provide the core basics for many other games - from WW1 and RCW to WW2, and Victorian Sci-Fi and VBCW. Great rules, proper fire & movement small unit tactics. And now free to download.

Solid universal sci-fi miniatures system (at a mid-stellar tech level, for Traveller players).  If it doesn't have a rule for your alien race/artifact/vehicle/troop, it easily accepts additions.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A very nice set of modern/sci-fi miniatures rules that works very well for humans, but not so well for alien psychologies that don't react to gunfire the same way we do.  The vehicle/gun construction rules let you build pretty much anything, but are simple and work fairly well in play.

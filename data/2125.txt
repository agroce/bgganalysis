GAME: Amazons
RANK: 3194
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Amazons could be showcased as and example how certain seemingly minor can changes can take the experience to wholly new level. By this I refer to a game named Hey, That's My Fish.  In both games players have the same goal, i.e., to secure the largest possible area to yourself by cutting the board by moving four pawns. 

The most apparent of the changes is the looks. By adding a (paste on) theme and art, Hey, That's My Fish feels much less abstract. The visual representation also makes it much easier to assess the situation and to calculate the worth of each move. So, even though games are often criticised for having a paste on theme, sometimes it is 100% justified and the game is much better with a theme than without.

However, the greatest change is in the basic mechanic how the board evolves. In Amazons you keep adding stuff onto the board, and at least to my eye the Amazon's board in the late game with squares and tens of tokens on it appears very busy and it is quite easy to miss liberties. In contrary, Hey That's My Fish is started with a board full of tiles which are then taken off one by one. In other words, you'll a nice clean table in the end. Effectively both games achieve the same goal but there is a huge difference in playability.

Third change is in the balance. Amazons is a 100% symmetrical game which in practice means that the starting player always has a slight edge. Although, I have to admit that the advantage seems quite small. Hey, That's My Fish features a modular asymmetric board and balancing rules regarding the initial placement of the pawns.

But what do I think about the game then? Well, it is ok for an abstract and would not refuse to play but for the reasons mentioned above I'd rather play Hey, That's My Fish. However, since Amazons does not require anything but the simplest of components (although a lot of them), I could imagine myself playing Amazons when stranded on an island.

Buenísimo. Con tan pocas piezas y un tablero de damas internacionales se puede jugar a este juego de alta estratégia y profundidad. Tiene movimientos muy libres y la finalidad en muchos casos varía ya que si bien tu no debes quedar encerrado, a veces es buena idea quedarte sólo en un territorio.

Tiene ciertos problemas luego de varias jugadas ya que siempre se torna algo repetitivo, los primeros movimientos generalmente no cambian ya que por lo general va de acción/reacción hasta que el primero quede al descubierto y el otro contraataque de una manera mucho mejor.

Okay, this has been (and still is) on my must have list for awhile.  I finally got to play this and it is as good as I thought it would be.  It has a bit of HTMF! in it as you have your pieces and you are trying to block other pieces from moving around freely.  Excellent game of position and blocking.  I will make my own set.

Been playing more on SuperDuperGames.org. This game only goes up in my estimation.

The more I play this, the more I love it.  It's got clarity and depth, which is a somewhat elusive combo.  I always feel like I have a shot at directing the outcome, even when I'm clearly outclassed.  If I had to play just one abstract until the end of time, this would be it.

EDIT: as of Jan 2011 I have begun to log my online plays of this game (only those played "real time", so not from SDG).  Through the end of January I have over 100 plays logged at IG Game Center and Super Duper Games.

I still have a lot to learn about Amazons strategy. Unfortunately, the games I have played seemed to devolve into a game of pure tempo about half way through with perfect clarity for the rest of the game. Such an early tipping point with perfect clarity made for a dénouement that I didn't like so well.

I feel like I should like this game more than I do. It has the same shrinking board grab a piece of it while you can thing going on as Hey That's My Fish and Battle Sheep, but without the annoyhing set up issues of those two. And yet... I don't seem to enjoy it as much as those two. It is a puzzle. At the moment, I feel like perhaps it isn't as quick as those two. In those two you're fighting for your space right off the bat, whereas in this one you start off in a large space and the first moves have no immediate impact that I can tell.

RATING: 9.5
The more that I play this game the more hooked that I become. Players are initially presented with an abundance of moves in the early stages of the game. As play continues and this number dwindles until there are no more moves available. The board is constantly changing as more and more arrows are placed splitting the board into multiple territories. Hopefully you have more squares compared to your opponent. 

Every competitive game that I've played seems to have "That unexpected move" that changes the outcome of the game.

RATING: 10
This is exactly what I wanted Hey! That's My Fish to be like!  The two have very similar mechanics, but Amazons has a lot more meat on its bones.  Like H!TMF, the game ends on somewhat of an anti-climax, but in this case it doesn't feel premature, because the events leading up to it are decisive and involved.  Faster set-up time too!
---
The more I play, the deeper the rabbit hole goes.  Because of the staggering freedom you have on each turn, coupled with the sheer power of the move-and-shoot mechanic, every turn [i]feels[/i] satisfying, which is a rare and magical quality few games are able to produce.  This is quite possibly the best of all modern abstracts.  

My only qualm is that White has a statistically measurable advantage, but I don't think it's substantial enough to justify implementing the pie rule (or any other equalizing means).

Upgraded to a 10. This is as perfect as board games get.  An absolute joy to play.

Sort of a more abstract version of Hey, That's My Fish. The strategy consists of trying to fence yourself off in large areas, and try to limit the opponent to smaller areas. However, sometimes it is not very clear which moves are good and which are bad, although that is probably just my lack of expertise in this game. A nice little abstract.

I'm one of those curious folk who loves Abstract games, and this is one of the best. ‘Elegant’ and ‘Simple’ are words that people use, correctly, to describe Amazons. It is deep and fascinating, and has a curious property that it is tactically flat, i.e. it does not have the tactical interaction of chess, where tactical ideas have to be learnt. This means that it is almost entirely strategic. Decisions are difficult, since the player is aware that concessions must be made to the opponent, and a challenge lies in judging at what point to sacrifice mobility for territory. 

I wish this game had a larger following, so that there would be more players online to play against.

I've been playing this by web at

http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/index.jsp

and after a half-dozen games, I'm hooked.

It would get a higher rating if not for my feeling that the opening game is (at least as far as I can tell) not all that important compared to the middle game, but it lasts a fair amount of time.  Meaning for me at least, I doubt I would choose to play this face-to-face much, I think it would be a touch tedious.  But I love it as a web game.

EDIT: Actually, with more play against better opponents, I am finding that the opening game seems more and more important to me...

EDIT: (20 games later) I hate this game, I always lose!  :-)

I don't understand why Amazons isn't a more popular game - it's easy to improvise a set, very simple to learn, beautifully elegant and profoundly deep. We play on a 10x10 draughts board with chess pawns and go stones. Reminiscent of [thing=188][/thing], which is my #1 game.

[thing=8203][/thing] does a great job of reimplementing the gameplay, extending it to 2-4 players and making it visually appealing.

移動して矢を射つだけのシンプルルール。徐々に盤面が狭まっていきエリアが決まっていくが、相手を閉じ込める=エリアを与えることであり、下手な手を打つと逆に相手を利することになる。相手を封じることと自分のエリアを確保することのバランス取りが面白く、じわじわエリアが確定していくので一手一手は軽く遊びやすい。

RATING: 7
This is one of the more underrated abstract games.  There are so many move choices each turn!  It is quite difficult to figure out exactly what your opponent is going to do, since it is quite easy to overlook his/her strongest move.  However, you know generally what you are supposed to be doing, and you feel like you have a high degree of control over your fate.  The duality of trying to box yourself in large areas, and box your opponents in small areas is highly interesting.  Unfortunately, the first few moves of the game can seem quite random, and it is sometimes not clear what is helping you, and what is hindering you.  The first person to make sense of it all will normally gain the advantage, but there will still be plenty of tactical fighting left.  I generally find abstract games rewarding, but not fun.  This one is actually quite fun though.

An amazing & brilliant abstract game. It's extremely satisfying to ensnare a group of your opponent's pieces while simultaneously freeing yourself from a would-be trap. That feeling alone makes this game worth playing again and again. But it has a lot more to offer than that.

RATING: 8
A territorial game of chess queen pieces.  You cannot capture or reduce your opponent's pieces but rather resort to blocking or locking them out (and in doing so you've cut off a section of the board from yourself as well).  You have to think positive and negative space at the same time with each move.  Easiest way to play is grab a Shogi board (10x10) and use black/white pieces from a Go set...

RATING: 9
Often when something is analysed the simple pleasures of life are forgotten or passed by for a deeper meaning.  A search to define the mechanic or uncover a clever trick by a designer often prevents the critic from seeing what is right in front of them.  Amazons is first a simple pleasure like cartoons on a Saturday morning and that should never be forgotten. Just as the cartoons may have depth and reveal some aspect of the human condition (Re: Simpsons) Amazons can provide a examination of how the balance between attack and defence or investigation into optimum play but I leave that up to you.

Gameplay is reminiscent of an 80s Arcade game before computer games took control of our lives and you can analyse and strategise as much as you hearts content.  But from the beginning to the end Amazons is a pure and simple pleasure.  Draw a grid, get some chess pawns and go pieces and start you wont regret it.

Having been intrigued by Amazons for a while, I printed out a paper grid, grabbed some beads and Icehouse pyramids, and knocked together a set. Reviews had led me to think this would probably be the sort of abstract I enjoy -- fast-playing, easy to teach, but with ample depth to explore.

It's kind of dull, though. Especially towards the end, where I suspect we could just have counted squares in the "eyes" and determined the winner without playing it out. The early and mid-game portions were okay, but not more interesting to me than my favorite abstracts (notably Hive and Yinsh, which take about the same amount of time to play).

I'd play it again if there was reason to think it would be more interesting the second time, but I'm glad I didn't buy it.

This is a tough call, but I'm going to be conservative here. Amazons is interesting, but [gameid=8203] is the same type of game - try to isolate your opponent, but don't allow him to seal off too much area - and just clearly better. I would never choose Amazons over Fish. 

For one thing, Amazons seems to frequently be 'over' earlier, and an early(ish) tipping point is already one small issue with HTMF. And I haven't looked into it systematically, but I don't think the 'heat' is as good here. (In the Berlekamp/Conway/Guy sense.)
I am also concerned about the first-player advantage; pretty sure the Pie Rule is in order.

An abstract we short-term-binged on back when we were learning new abstracts a dozen at a time. There's something compelling about this one, where you move a piece and fire an arrow that occupies a space on the board. Games with shrinking boards are always so alluring to me (Zertz is another I quite like), and this is no different. I cannot pretend to understand anything about it, and like many abstracts, connecting action to outcome takes a while. In other words, I cannot describe a strong move. 

Eventually I'll teach my son how to play this one, but I'm not sure my wife and I will go back to this one since only a few abstracts from this period made it onto our A List, and we don't game enough to spend much time on our B List or C List.

Clever little abstract about boxing your opponent in. I'm not good enough yet to keep the endgame up in the air (most of my games end when we box each other in and none of our pieces are sharing open spaces, relegating the endgame to "how many moves do each of us have left?"). I really like the freedom of movement and the shooting of arrows adds another layer. I need to play this more.

Very elegant game, with an overwhelming abundance of moves to choose between early on, gradually shrinking as the game moves on.

There are interesting strategical tradeoffs to be made - how much is it worth to have numerical advantage in an area?  How much territory can you afford to give the other player in order to end up with 4 queens against two, for example?  How does one weigh flexibility and keeping one's options open against sealing off definite territory?

Amazons is a deep game, yet accessible - as even with random play, the game will progress towards the end, and there will be a winner.  No danger of repetition, and no need for clumsy rules to handle such a situation.

This is a decent abstract game which works kind of like [gameid=8203] but there is no point scoring... the game ends when one player can't move a pawn (they loose).  Plays quickly and its interesting to see the board develop into sectors as you try to keep you pieces in free space.  I do find the ending unsatisfying for some reason as once every section is closed off you can just count the spaces to see who wins... not too different from Go I suppose but I feel like something is missing.

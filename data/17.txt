RATING: 9
I was given a button at a friend's game con, and we all played a tournament all weekend. When I first got this, I could play nothing else for a while. Addictive, but it wore off after a while. Always a good game to get out when you don't have a lot of time. I have some of each set, I believe, including all the Sailor Moon ones.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Quite simply, one of the most elegant, flexible abstract game designs you'll even see. Hundreds of buttons later, I still enjoy working the probabilities on optimal moves and strategies for games. A touchstone in game design to me.

RATING: 7
One of the rare games that plays infinitely better online (at www.buttonmen.dhs.org) than it does in real life.  The ability to change your dice sizes is part of what makes this game so good and is where a lot of the skill comes in, but have you ever seen dice with 11, 17 or 29 sides in real life?  Playing online makes keeping track of a die's size and skills effortless.  Also, online you're not limited to playing with the buttons you happen to have with you.  You can change the matchup after every game.

Fun game if played quickly and in the right spirit.  99.99% of my games were payed online (on the now apparently defunct Buttonmen Online web Game site).  I think some (or most) of the button statistics are now available from various online sources.  

Decent game that does its intended job of filling the time in between games at conventions.  Give it a try at least once or twice, especially with some of the more special dice powers.

Husband rates this 8 but wife doesn't like this game and rates it 4.  Husband thinks a little skill and a little strategy combine to make this fun, plus it can be played in 10 minutes or less, so it's not a huge investment.  Wife just doesn't get it.

Great for those with the die rolling itch needing to be scratched. Simplistic, but ingenious nonetheless. I remember spending hours playing "tournaments" with the piles of button men we procured. I believe all of this was a secret desire to roll more dice under the thin veil of rules. Not really inclined to play this game again.

This is an oddly addicting little FILLER GAME... I always whip this one out between games or while we are waiting. Just grab your bag-o-dice, print off some characters, download the FREE rule set and you are good to go! The best part of this game is it is entirely free! Everything can be found online. Haven't played this one, try it out... now! Button Men is also great during RPG sessions while waiting or... idea... implement the same mechanics into a challenge within the rpg somewhere. Just a though.

Fair.  Not a bad little game, but if I ever saw anyone actually wearing the buttons, I'd pretend not to notice them.  It would work better (and massively cheaper) as cards instead of buttons, and still be equally portable.  So why buttons?  Just to stand out?

This might be about as much asymmetry as you can put into a game and still have me not like it.

Update: Liking it more now that I've played more genuinely asymmetric characters. Still, it's more fun when played online (easy to find opponents, computer does the boring math for you, weird recipes are implementable) and yet then its key selling points are missing (fast to play, you get to roll lots of dice). Not deeply flawed, just unfixably so.

Homemade, with a Touhou retheme.

As a game: Genius. A very simple, low-level idea which becomes a full playable game. It's so simple to homemake(the only components required are dice, and the rules and character stats are in internet).

As a commercial product: Failure. 5$ for EACH button, which only has a bunch of stats? Cheap artwork? This game should be in a box with fighters represented with cards and lots of polyhedrial dice.

The videogame version and the new print&play official card version of CheapAss are a much better format.

RATING: 8
The base rules are very simple (special dice / character powers can be added), play is quick, and it features a nice mix of tactics and luck. Tactical play has more mathematical depth to it than might be apparent at first blush.

This is my favorite dice-centric game. The theme is shallow as a puddle, but that's OK. It doesn't hurt that polyhedral dice are so cool.

The buttons were a neat marketing gimmick for conventions and multiple sales, but cards would be more convenient. 2011: Several Button Men are available as print-as-play downloads from cheapass.com. It would be nice to see this game released as a box set of cards and dice re-themed for families.

RATING: 4
Unimpressive. I like the art, I like the idea even, I'm just not inspired by the actual activity. There is some strategy in it, just not interesting strategy. (I am willing to believe there is some thought that can go into choosing which dice to use in the first place, but I am unlikely to test this hypothesis.) And the scoring system is unappealing; it seems like it's just what was lying around... I capture all my opponents dice, and still lose? yeah, OK.

Played this last Christmas at the annual DC gamers Christmas lunch. We used it as the game with which to choose froma pile of games that we all had brought. I was first in trying the game and got to pick first. I chose 1960:The Making of a President, unreleased at that moment. Later on, at Essen, Christian Leonhard brought it for me. Isn't that cool?

How can a game played with buttons and standard RPG dice be so compelling? Partly it's because rolling dice is fun, partly it's because the design features smart abilities and some surprisingly deep choices. Not the main course, but one of the better appetizers on the menu for my money.

RATING: 7
Good mini-game. A nice mix of luck and strategy. Lots and Lots of buttons (plus you can make your own). Not recommended for kids because most of the buttons have an S&M or gore theme. Too bad -- otherwise the game could be played by 6 and up.

RATING: 10
It looks like some people are missing the point. The strategies involved in selecting your character&#039;s swing dice, capturing your opponent&#039;s dice, then trying to win the majority of sides, make this one of the coolest math-based games to come down the pike in a long time. Try it out for yourself: using the buttons and rules from the various &#039;official&#039; websites, you have all the info you need to select dice and start playing. Watch out though, you may become hooked...

RATING: 7
shockingly, this game is not all luck

...but let's be honest with ourselves, there is still quite a lot of luck.  At least 25% of games are resolved after the initial roll, at least another 25% are won by luck swings during the game, and the rest can have some delightfully subtle strategy.  The game is so short that I don't mind that level of luck.

All that said, the official characters were not all balanced.  Some are provably strictly better than others, and some of the special types of dice get very fiddly and complex.  But there's no need to limit yourself to the official characters, and just picking mixes of normal polydice is surprisingly well balanced.

Finally played a few times with my son. I'm not sure I'm playing it right, because it doesn't seem to have as much strategy as others had led me to believe. It's fine as a super quick filler, but I think I'd rather play something like Martian Dice in this category?

You roll some dice, if you are lucky you can beat your opponent.

A simple, but deep strategy game that lets you make use of all those polyhedral dice you have.

Went to the site, downloaded the images for the base set and printed the rules, then printed out the base set images onto cardstock. Then I mounted them onto cereal box cardboard, sprayed them with Krylon, and cut them out. I'm waiting for a 1 lb bag of dice to show up from Amazon so I can test it, but even if I don't like the game, these cards will make some sweet-looking coasters.

Great game to play online, but definetly too overpriced to actually buy. And they call themselves "Cheapass".

RATING: 3
Roll dice, highest wins, not a lot of game but neat idea and some of the buttons are really neat.  I got the BROM edition which uses d16's so it's always cool to whip out 10 d16's at a gaming group for the "ooohhh's and ahhhhh's" they inspire.  Most gamers haven't rolled a d16 before as so few games use them.

I haven't played a single game in RL yet, even though I own a couple of buttons. Instead, I'm playing online at www.buttonmen.com. Lotsa fun ;-)

While it may be kind of simplistic in its basic form, the game can get quite tricky when the myriad special die types come into play.  If you like to have a lot of luck and just a bit of strategy in your game, this is a good one.  And if you don't like any of the buttons, a cheap Badge-a-Minit lets you make your own -- I did!

Silly little thing, but good for waiting in line at cons.  I think more people should pass out button men buttons at things like Gen Con.  Good way to pass the time.  Also fun if you work at some Bennigans style restaurant where you have to wear a bunch of flair.

Fun and quick game that's useful when you want to play something while waiting somewhere or if you needed a way to pass the time while playing a longer game between turns or just a little silly fun.  Recommended if you're the type of person that lists in their interests, "likes beating people up."

RATING: N/A
This game gained a quick following after one of the major gaming conventions of 1999. It features several characters, represented on actual stickpin buttons, that each have a unique allowance of polyhedral dice. These dice endow each character with fairly unique combat abilities. Players roll the dice against each other and take their opponents' dice as casualties. The object of the game is take out the most die 'sides' during the combat. It's quite simple, quite inventive, and deeper than it would seem at first. I have: Samurai: Honzo / Konami; Diceland; iago / karl; bunnies / lab rat;

A very clever but one dimensional game. An excellent five minute time waster , probably worth what you would pay for it, if you already own the dice.
It's really cool if they have done a cross promotion with another company you like.

Button Men is a great filler, perhaps one of the best with gamers. It is a dice game where knowledge of probability, math, and good tactics determine the winner. 

What's not to like about beating people up in a small, math-heavy abstract game which plays in about five minutes for a full best-of-five match?

The game is now a free print-and-play game, so please do yourself a favor and check it out!

Saying I own it is a little bit of a misnomer.  I have craploads of dice, and some notecards with the unit stats.  That's Notecard Men, I guess.  In any case, this is one of the neatest games I have come across in many years.

The extremely quick nature of this game, and its fascinating tactics and mechanisms make it an oft-replayed game.  Most real-life games of this end with, "Let's play that again."  I used to play this constantly on www.buttonmen.com.

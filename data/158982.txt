So many plusses! Reasonably simple wargame but still with proper manoeuvre and shoot mechanics. Reimplimentation of a good-ole 1983 game - prettified but still has flat cardboard pieces on a great big hex grid. It's a fight between a small number of individual complex units - it even has a check-box locational damage system so I can possibly view it as Federation Commander ultra-light. Includes half dozen custom dice.

Has been criticised for limited plane selection but extra plane sheets here:

I have never played any version of Blue Max, but I've been researching about it, and I have to say that, while some of the negative comments seem fair, some of if it seems very biased (chits are better than cards just because). Also, the card system is very much directional (you can theoretically try to hit an enemy from the same direction over and over and bring it down faster), whereas, in the old system, it was much less meaningful for the planes to have different parts to damage.

Also, I don't care if the planes are historically accurate. I do care about some planes in the original that were practically indistinguishable, just from the graphics. Very realistic.

Enfundado al completo. Hay gente que lo compara con el original, pero es un juego algo más sencillo, para el público y más atractivo. He conseguido que gente que no jugaría a un hexagonado en su vida lo pruebe y le guste. La tensión de saber quién será al que se le muera el piloto es constante y las rachas de mala puntería son legendarias! He jugado ya muchas partidas y no me aburro de él.

NOTA: SOBRESALIENTE

Somewhere between Crimson Skies and Wings of War.
Not as complex as the former, not as simple as the latter.

Would be neat if this was a bit more streamlined and allowed for bigger dogfights.

RATING: 8
One play in, I like the system. The movement options feel appropriate for the era, and the damage cards are an elegant way of handling angle, deflection and critical hits.  So, overall I think this game hits a good mix of realism and abstraction.

While I don't think WWI aerial combat is quite as interesting as WW2 aerial combat owing to the nature of the planes of the era with their low speed, HP and firepower, I think they've done about as good of a job as you can do with these types of planes. Also, nice components.

On a side note, I think the complaints about lack of variety in the plane/flight characteristics are somewhat misguided. The characteristics of the different planes just aren't going to be significantly different within the given game mechanics. You'll need a much grittier, detailed game for those differences to manifest themselves in significant ways, and this just isn't that game, nor is it trying to be.

Sold.  No expansions and the planes included in the game do not make the most compelling match-ups.

Rating based on one F2F game.  Liked the components, nice quick and easy mechanics are enjoyable.

Looking at the other comments, complaints about the artwork not being correct are legitimate, but since I am not an avid WWI air combat historian, I wouldn't have known and it certainly doesn't impact the gameplay.  Note that if you play with the optional altitude rules, you can't see the plane artwork while playing anyway.

I think the comments about the airplane content being low are somewhat baseless.  Given the abstract level of the game, there are only so many ways you can move 0, 1, or 2 hexes per turn.  I think the included planes give a nice spread of variety for 90% of the people that will play it.

I frequently run 10 player game nights, and this could be an ideal game for it; esp. using WoG minis. I have found that 10 player WoG can get a bit finicky with setting up, having room for, and cleaning up all the decks.  The potential overlaps of a ton of airplanes are also easier to deal with in a hex-based game.

X-wing miniatures grandaddy.  Cardboard, and pencil and paper order assingment, but the dog fighting is excellent.  My biggest gripe was how badly the board warped when I opened the box, nearly 3/8" while folded.  But a month staying in my house, with my Magic collection sitting on top of it resolved the problem.

Extremely disappointed in this new edition of a solid game.  With only three aircraft types this new version of the game is not worth picking up IF you already own the game.  The game comes with only six aircraft types when the original game came with around 30 types.  Also shame on the person picking the aircraft types as two of the opposing aircraft's NEVER saw each other in combat. Sopwith Triplane and Fokker Triplane were in different areas and the Sopwith Triplane was phazing out as the Fokker Triplane was coming on line.  The rules are virtually the same as the earlier edition but from one review I read they didn't even include revisions made years ago to some of the aircraft maneuvers.  If you never owned this game then you will be picking up a sound WW1 air war game, yet with limited airplane choices.  But if you can get a copy of an older edition I would suggest doing that before picking this one up.

Highly disappointed. The one and only problem with this game is that a F R E E upgraded, wonderful version done by the same Author, exists. It's called "Canvas Eagles".

I don't see how this... THING... could ever compare with a free wonderful rulebook, a free homeprinted hex map and a bunch of free counters. And let's not speak of the Wings of War minis franchise.

Incomplete. Bad map with bad overimposed hexes orientation. Very bad and confusing manual. This is how you DON'T remake a venerable game - without respect.

Extremely disappointed by this new edition. Editorial mistakes mean that some of the very few aircraft are incorrectly depicted - this is sheer carelessness. More significantly the publishers have stripped out 80% of the aircraft types available to play - this is a crippled version of a great game. Clearly they intend to sell expansions with the missing components, gouging their consumers. Pathetically, they have not included the iconic aircraft included on the front cover. 

Gameplay is equivalent to previous editions - so no complaint there. Of course, this version suffers from a lack of options.

A rip-off. I am unlikely to buy Stratelibri products any time in the future.

Simple and fun, and that with all the rules in (altitude and all). I kind of wish there were something more in the box, like some scenarios and more ship models.

There has been some criticism about the game, but, as I've never played any other Blue Max, I'll leave here something that someone in the fora out there said: "Better this Blue Max than no Blue Max". I really like this kind of game.

EDIT: I've been playing with the Miniatures rules. It is indeed a superior game; the good news is that, if you don't mind using a different ship to simulate the many ships you find in the miniature game, you can easily adapt the new version to that version.

EDIT 2: I highly recommend the new Blue Max stuff you find in Canvas Eagles:

Rather than describe the details of how the game works, I'll make some sweeping comparisons of the two games in terms of their broader conceptual differences.

Wings of War of course uses cards as the planes, and whatever available surface as the field of combat, with maneuver cards played in sets of three, and shooting being automatically successful if in range. Each individual maneuver card is a fairly straightforward move, and in conjunction can produce approximations of the more complex sorts of loopdeloops and chandelles and such that you might find in classical dogfighting.

Meanwhile, in Blue Max, these sorts of bigger combinations are condensed into single moves, often only moving one hex in distance, but changing orientation along the hex. This means that once you're in firing range, it can often turn into a real meat grinder as you sorta spin around within a tight clump firing blindly into the night.

I think that both games do the same thing in different ways, and they both do it really gracefully. I think BlueMax is a bit more condensed with some nice nuance, while Wings of War is a bit nittier and grittier, with every move properly simulated. So while WoW is sorta a WWI airplane simulator, Blue Max is more of a WWI air combat simulator. If those two statements seem the same, you have no reason to be alarmed: You are completely sane.

Very good WW1 dogfight simulation. Has the strength of being hex-based and thus very clear with distance, line of sight and similar. However, this will be hard to get to the table as it is too detailed and rule dense for casual players to grasp and when playing with seasoned gamers I will likely want to play something else.

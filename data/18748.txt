Lightweight CDG that plays fast. Gets quicker the more you play. A game that goes the distance is around four hours unless you want to use the holding boxes, but much of this is thinking time. Its one of those where you just can't wait to see the next hand of cards. Constantly puts the gamer to the question eg. attack up north or recruit down south? Many innovative features combine with high repeat play value. Not exceeded in historical quality & detail by any other CDG.

I like the card art, which blends new and old so effectively you don't notice the difference, the sharpness of the countersheet, and the map. Otherwise I would have brought the physical product to market in manner more in keeping with the quality of the design, however this is so strong it merits a 10 anyway.

Unhappy King Charles is an incredible game.  If you like card driven games, you will probably enjoy it.  The play is fun.  The mechanics work well to capture the theme.  Plus, there are many innovative ideas, such as alt-history cards, core cards for each player (so that you never have a dead hand).  It uses a combined deck, but with different time periods, kind of like the three decks in Paths of Glory or Shifting Sands.  The designer notes are impressive.  The artwork looks great.  The components are top-notch.  The rules are well-written.  There are great tutorials for learning the game, and the designer is very quick at answering questions.

The card-driven games have built up a nice line where the good things can be taken and the bad ones avoided. This game didn't use this basic idea and ended with nothing more than something pretty bland.

It's a game where you avoid battle to gain time, which is an ok principle. I have the impression that there are too little card plays. It's not worth the effort so destroy the local notables.

Further:
* Bombardments takes too long and can easily be lifted.
* There is not really a choice between OPS's and the event. This is really bad when you end up with P-cards when you are a Royallist or R-cards when you are the Parlementary player.
* Too little is done with combat cards.
* Combat proportions are absolute instead of relative. 6 to 2 is the same as 20 to 16.
* Recruitment is too limited.

I loved the game after my first play, but I was inadequately prepared. I had got most of the rules but hadn't really understood they locked together, what I was supposed to be doing, and what I needed to do to stop the Royalists. After a second game (PBEM) I still find the rules quite fiddly-- the complexity isn't as encapsulated into cards as it is in many CDGs. The game creates a wonderfully immersive historical recreation with lots of flavour, but I'm not sure I'll get to the level of rules familiarity that would make it really flow. Also, I think the nature of the conflict (a civil war with no real lines of battle) means the narrative isn't as strong as in some games.

RATING: 7
Having now played this a few times, both solo and ftf, my opinion is that it's a fair game, but definitely not one of my favourites. It plays fairly fast (about three hours) and it's good for a change of pace, as the approach seems to be much more on political control than is usual, even in similar games.

The game seems to develop around movement and sieges rather than battle, which is normally very indecisive. In fact, these are usually mostly a matter of luck, and while I understand the reasons for this, I find it not entirely satisfactory: it feels like you're more worried about not losing rather than winning. 

Overall, it's not a game that's going to see a lot of plays, but one to keep for the different approach and unusual theme, which feels very well adapted.

RATING: 7
Takes some classic CDG mechanics and applies them to the English Civil War. Tense and multifaceted with interesting problems for both players surrounding such issues as recruitment and desertion. Feels relatively historical. Also, the period style of the rules and playbook is great. Good sense of theme.

A few strange decisions, having separate event and ops cards seems like a step backwards. Overly convoluted in a few areas. Lots of luck.

Played only 2 games but I must admit that this one is excellent. A bit too much chrome and rules exceptions but the flavor it gives the game is commendable. A lot of strategy options, decisions to make, trade-offs. Seems well balanced although the King won twice, albeit by a very narro margin the second time.

I did not find it scripted.

First game took 7 hours, second about 5. It is playable in a long evening once you figured the mechanics out.

Make sure to use the 4 page summary in the Files section on BGG. It's all you need afeter a few turns.

Played at BROGFest 2011 for the first time. Very enjoyable game. The rules seemed opaque at first and difficult to get into - I almost gave up actually - but I am very happy that I stuck with it. Colorful. Very evocative of the period and easy to immerse yourself in its world with the art, graphics, fonts and commentary. Strategy seems deep, play is very fast and it all can be done in 3-4 hours. Kudos to the designer!

EDIT: Re-evaluated from an 8 as I don't see myself playing it that much anymore. The re-playability is a bit of a concern for me. It seems much like a basketball game where you trade shots for an action packed 4 quarters, the end is nigh, things are still even, but then the affair is suddenly decided in the last few seconds of the game on foul shots (can the Royals zip around and steal enough spaces at the end) - it seems as if you could just cut the chase down to those last few seconds and all that exertion expended the previous 4 quarters was kind of meaningless. 

It is a shame that a great, tension-filled game devolves into something that feels gimmicky in the last moments. If the game was tweaked so it there was a better chance to win outright at an earlier stage, I think it would be more appealing for me. As it is, there is just a small chance to get a victory like this (or so it seems) and this is really not very likely as each player can easily avoid falling behind with their territorial gains (again, so it seems).

RATING: 6
Attractive card-driven recreation of the English Civil War. My first game went five hours for five turns. (Upate: In my second game, we finished an entire game in 4 hours.) Each turn contains a lot of detailed conditions that need to be met before play can continue to the next turn. It seems I spent a lot time worrying about these conditions (desertion, naval activities, political control, recruitment) instead going after my opponent. This can be good a good thing, because it means your army upkeep should be done well before launching an attack on an enemy. But it came across in my first play as fiddly book-keeping. 

The unit counters use tiny photographs of painted miniatures (as opposed to silhouettes or illustrations) that I found very clever from a production stand point. I think I would have preferred to see an area-to-area map rather than a point-to-point, since the circles fill up with chits quickly and my opponent wanted to cover the town names with PC markers. I recommend off-setting the PC markers so they at least don't cover the town names. ...Or perhaps folks should use those little transparent disks (found in some craft and game shops) in light blue and orange and use those to show political control.

Overall, pretty fun. My ECW buddy rates this much higher. And for a two-player CDG, it's a tight contest once you get the hang of it.

Have played this once on Vassal via PBEM. Not the best game for this type of forum as there is a lot of going back and forth. Don't go into this game expecting there to be a lot of blood letting. Actually winning battles is quite rare in this game...it's more about seizing strategic points in order to control regions. Top class components.

RATING: 8
Another GMT CDG this time by Charles Vassey. The theme is solid and the CDG engine is used to good advantage. Having distinct "ops" vs "event" cards seems a bit retrograde, but the ability to make limited use of otherwise useless cards mitigates this somewhat; and, instead of "Home Cards" (Napoleonic Wars/Wellington), here you have what are referred to as "core cards" that work essentially the same way. You are royally screwed if you find yourself without any ops cards so the core cards make sure you will always have at least two.

The game isn't as long as FtP, PoG or WWII:BtB but a lot longer than either WtP or Hannibal. Even after two games, I found myself making constant references to the rules and the pace seemed sluggish at times. I have to admit I was hoping for something a bit more streamlined and less gritty.

One bright spot is the combat system. We've seen many different approaches taken in these CDGs and none yet seem to have found favour with everyone. However, the system here strikes me as quite good. The combination of interception/evasion, dispersal, and the battle resolution itself leaves a lot of flexibility to both sides regardless of the outcome. Personally, I'm relieved to see we may be moving away from the dice basket approach and back to a workable single die roll.

This game falls into the Wilderness War category for me but with a welcome return to the political control overlay = preliminary favourable rating.

My expectations on this were off I think. I was looking forward to a simple introductory level CDG a bit like We the People but covering the English Civil War UKC is not it - first game we spent ages checking back in the rules, not a good sign. Second game wasn't much better and took too long for the feeling of enjoyment. Now traded, doubt I'll play again.

Preliminary rating after one play.

I really enjoyed playing this. I am new to CDGs, but if this is typical of the enjoyment I can find in them then I will be a happy camper in the future. I enjoyed how the game captured some of the difficulties of maintaining armies in the field with limits to recruitment and the annual desertion. I have always been partial to games that limit what I can do as a player. The fact that battles are often better not fought (and knowing when that is the case) also intrigues me. I find that the map with the units in play is a bit difficult to read and thought that was due to my colour-blindness, but other folks who came by to check the game out while we played also mentioned it. Minor issue really.

When all is said and done, I had fun, which is the most important, perhaps ultimately the only, reason to play a game. 

PROS: Interesting situation for both sides especially with the impact of guaranteed, highly influencial cards. I like how the important cards are added to the deck such that they will show up shortly afterwards, meanwhile retaining some sense of the unknown. Also, a small number of random cards are included in each sessions deck to further impact replayability and tension. Recruiting limits and the impact of desertation further restricts the player, which I like. Combat is risky as it should be.

CONS: Map can be a bit snug once the units get on there. I have some problems instantly identifying what border town is in what region. Might be my colourblind eyes...

An interesting exercise in not fighting battles. This is really a game of area control with armies spending most of their time posturing and projecting and protecting influence. It does require a different way of thinking than with traditional wargames where the object it to build the build and smash. As a result I don't think it's the easiest game to learn. Overall though a fun experience.

RATING: 4
3 plays in, eh. It's OK. I think it's a by-now traditional GMT CDG in that it's held down by excessive complexity and then throttled by pedestrian pacing, excessive length, and a lack of tension. There's some back, some forth, for me none of the events generate measurable excitement or tension, if you don't get the ops you're hosed, not a lot of what you do matters that much, and then the VCs are too coarse to yield much in the way of excitement towards the end, and the whole thing sort of lumbers to conclusion. UKC! is OK, but I'm not lining up to play it again. This was an impulse buy I came to regret, the sort of game I'm trying very hard not to buy in future.
---
Playing again, I'm more inclined to round down than up. UKC! has some fun and evocative stuff in it, but I just can't shake the feeling that it doesn't really add up to anything in the end. It's OK, I'll play again (one more time at least), but I'm having a hard time being sold on how the event deck is structured (I think the Hannibal model is more interesting), the events don't feel that interesting or driving, the victory conditions and power base levels feel wrong (nobody has ever been anywhere close to losing on PCs), and I can't help feeling like this is We the People with twice the length, 8 times the rules, maybe a little more depth, and a functioning battle system. Now, a functioning battle system is worth something. But I dunno.
---
Initial play was fairly promising, and I'm optimistic that maybe after what, about a dozen tries, we'll get a decent CDG again. It's always frustrating when the first couple games using the system are so good, and then we've had so many klunkers. Oh well.

Even though I liked it, there is no denying this game is over-chromed and too fiddly. A lot of the design is solid, then you get to local notables and subordinate generals and recruiting and and forming the NMA and there is a lot of rules grit that makes an otherwise clean system (and one with a fair dollop of luck) unwieldy. Where have all the good game developers gone? There is such a huge chasm these days between the real pros (like Mark Simonitch and Vance von Borries) and the hordes of designer/hobbyists that GMT publishes. We'd all be a lot better off if some of those enthusiastic but inexperienced designers could be given the benefit of an experienced developer. Charles Vasey has a few games to his credit, so he's not in the same category as some of the truly green designers we see, but there is no question in my mind this game really needed some screws to be tightened.
---
Gack, another huge rulebook. For some reason I had thought that UKC was going to be a simpler game; probably just an offhand comment I misinterpreted (maybe the "based on We the People" comment in the game description), but 25 pages becoming the norm for these CDGs from GMT is not good. Learning Clash of Monarchs was a struggle, and I haven't even begun yet on Pursuit of Glory (and may well never do so). Once you get past 20 it gets really hard.

I wish we could find some happy medium between the rule-aversion bordering on paranoia at Columbia and what seems like a complete indifference to rules length at GMT.

Feels like chess with dice and cards.  The random elements are brutal, but not a-historical.  Probably my favorite use of cards in the 18 or so CDGs I've played.  Have definitely learned a lot about the unusual theme from the game.  It really does need an official list of errata and clarifications.  Once you grok the full, clarified rules, and get over the role of chaos in the game (and a few other minor issues), it's really a top shelf design, imho. Excellent as an educational simulation, as well as a pretty wild game.  Seems to need the Wotten Woyalists variant though to be balanced.

The sort of CDG that I like - no hand management or bizarre choices between options that were not mutually exclusive in reality. The game does its subject justice and I feel presents both sides with many of the historical quandaries that shaped the course of the war. The addition of the alt-history cards is a nice option that helps to counterbalance the predictability of the mandatory events (the Covenanters and the NMA), while the first turn, delightfully, gives both sides options before hostilities commence.

The only downside I've encountered thus far is that the progress of the game can be slowed if sides draw the other side's event cards too often, but that's a fairly minor gripe.

Really good CDG, with more subtleties (and more chrome as a result) than some other CDGs, but this is what makes it such a fascinating game. A lot of decisions to be made which depend among other things on your hand of cards, the stage of the Civil War, and of course the off die roll.

The idea of battles not always being decisive is modeled very well in the game, as is the political to and fro of the period at local level. Obvious that the designer is very familiar with his subject. The rulebook needs to be read carefully, and referencing a rule is not always easy during play. However, I would suggest that you will gain good familiarity with the rules after two to three plays.

Can't wait for a mounted map for what is an excellent game.

Some problems from We the People are here 20 years after. 
But We the people was a simple game playable in less then 2 hours, this is not.
This is a simple game filled with chrome. A game that goes to the last turn should take 5 hours. 

I like it but is too fiddly, but we shuld have been spared such things like local noble, local recruitment, militia and veteran units. 
Even more since this is an heavily luck based game.

The bottom line is that this is a game that shows potential but that needed and heavy development, to stand up in the crowd of the plain-boring CDG GMT is publishing these days.

This is a great game.  It has similar mechanics to all the card driven games but there are small differences that have a huge effect on how to play the game.  I'm still trying to figure out how to play it properly but I will have a ton of fun figuring it out.

Pros:
Very fun to play
Plays quick (4 hours)
Great theme
Tense game play
Card design is great

Cons:
The map and counters are frustrating to play with (the colors are really confusing)
Names of regions should be outside of space (can't see them when a control marker is on them).
The cards are really thin, very flimsy (this game deserves better GMT!)
Layout of information on map could have been better
This game deserved better development

In the world of CDW's UKC is a welcome addition. The thing I like most is the way battles and armies are handled: you don't want to assemble large armies and fight, unless you're certain of great gains. Big armies tend to vaporize within a couple of turns.
The amount of rules and exceptions is tolerable for me: definately a lot more than Hannibal, not too much.

Here are some problems I had with this game:
- Unless you are colour blind map and counter are inelegant
- Chrome, chrome, chrome until you choke. This game would have needed a good developer. I like chrome, tables and rules but here with such much randomness and general light game-play it is just adding clunkiness to what could have been an elegant game.
- The game lacks charm: it does`t capture or immerse me at all - it stays cold and just gamey. This might just be a personal taste I guess even if I usually like that period.
- Mainly I find the game is lacking a clear purpose of what it tries to do. A bite of military, a bite of influence, a bite of naval, a bite of events with cards a bite chrome with the names of units and leaders etc. At trying to do a bite of everything if fails at having a clear purpose or two that would give it a distinct personality. It ends up being a somewhat rules/tables heavy patchwork of a lot of things.

Relinquished to BGG Wargame Chain of Generosity, 2017

A highly regarded game that I finally acknowledged that if I haven't played it 9 years, it ain't gonna happen. I blame the English Civil War for not sufficiently firing my imagination. (I feel so insular ... the shame ... the shame.)

RATING: 7.5
Has a lot of personality for a fairly simple rulebook.  I should probably give this an '8' but I feel like I should play it more than once first.

In that one play, I won all 13 battles that were fought!  A truly rare stroke of luck in a long and undistinguished wargaming career.  :)  (See my opponent shadow9d9's ridiculously long review thread for more on this story.)

RATING: 3
Update: We tried again, this time with more perspective as an area control game. Unfortunately, it was still a bad experience. Your choices are limited to flipping one or two PC markers, getting into 50-50 dice offs in combat, or getting into a siege you may never be able to complete because of attrition. And that's only if you manage to get the ops. Otherwise you'll spend most of your turn doing very little. Actual combat is rare. The naval rules are pointless. A game for those who prefer pseudo-historicity over actual game play. It's not interesting, or fun, or even historical. Just play a card (#91 for those interested) and welp, Hull falls. No, there's nothing you can do about it. Bad history, and ham-handed game play.

[This rating sparked a revenge rating on BGG for my own game, and some bizarre criticism on CSW that amounts to little more than trolling, from both Charles Vasey and Lee Brimmicombe-Wood for a game neither have actually played.]
---
Not bad, but there are several elements I just didn't like. The combat system is a total crapshoot, and building up large armies is impossible due to the attrition rules. Not that you would want to build a major army because you probably won't get the ops to move it as often happened in our games. Drawing 14 cards, with exactly 1 of those cards having a ops value, was a very unfun experience.

The chrome is a little excessive, too, and I'm not convinced yet that the Naval rules are necessary at all.

In addition I'd have to say going back to a single-choice CDG was a mistake. It drains an incredible amount of interest out of the game if there's only one possible use for the card, and you can get really hosed if you draw a handful of the other guy's event cards. The cards contain lots of historical flavor but some of the events are incredibly heavy handed (Oxford and Hull can fall with a single card play, if you happen to draw it). Yet, ironically, there's nothing to force King Charles south.

Still, for all that, I want to give the game one more shot before giving up on it completely.

RATING: 5.5
Rating based on only one play - and that against an opponent who had played a few times before so, as the game requires quite precise play, I got somewhat steam-rollered.

Pro's

- Very thematic and I liked the history. A fair bit of chrome to achieve that history but within acceptable complexity level for me. More complex than Hannibal and about the same as Wilderness War.

- I like the Political (area) Control aspect to the game.

Cons

- Battles are decided by a pretty simple dice roll mechanic and since there aren't that many battles there is no chance for the luck of the dice to average out.

- Cards are drawn from a common deck and there are a few cards (Campaigns for example) which are far more powerful than others, and some which are almost worthless to one side. It is therefore easy for skewed card distributions to completely scupper one side.

- Not all of the chrome is necessary.

- Didn't like the lack of flexibility in army composition, i.e. once a brigade joins an army you can not re-assign, split it off to manage the army limit restrictions. This doesn't feel right.

- It felt a bit dull. Playing as Parliament there didn't seem a lot to do apart from place/flip control markers and avoid combat in the Early War due to the Royalist's better brigades and better leaders. 

I will play again, as one play is not enough to judge by, but it would have to leave a better impression to avoid heading for the trade/sale pile.

Interesting take on the CDG genre. You have the old school single strategy deck which I think is good for a game of this era. You can't plan on holding a certain card at some point in the game and thus you have to live with what you get and adapt. I really doubt the forces of the ECW planned far ahead in any event so this solution is great even if I usually prefer one deck for each player.

What makes the game interesting to me is how well it portraits the ECW as I see it (I don't know much about the war really so shoot me if I'm wrong). It's mostly about smaller forces moving around trying to convert the countryside to the right side while avoiding the other players big hitters. It's hard to assemble and move larger armies and it's even harder to force the other player to fight them which makes it a game of trickery and subterfuge. Often you'll start a siege just to force the other player to waste precious card plays to assemble an army and to come to you to relive the siege.

So far I'm impressed. There are a few wrinkles left but I haven't been this excited about a CDG in a while.

Good work!

I'm really torn about this game. Years ago I would have raved about it, played two dozen times, then watch it languish on my shelf. Now I've played so many more games, I see right away that this game is excellent in so many ways but simply does not have a payoff in fun for the complexity and rules-lookup involved. It is incredibly well-deisnged and balanced, and makes the best of use of political control I've seen (better than Hannibal, WtP, or Twilight Struggle). 
 
My only complaints are found in failure to streamline. Asking someone like Jerry Taylor to playtest and develop this game would have done wonders. Hammer of the Scots achieves the same effects of desertion, factional loyalites, and command difficulties with a fraction of the rules. Also a game on the Roundheads might do better to focus on asymmetries of morale, manpower, and political will. Instead I'm doing quite a bit of beancounting where my I game the system to get my veterans on the board. Awesome game  that I'm very enthusiastic about, but for me the time commitment will keep me away.

RATING: 6
2016-12-22 : Only played a couple of turns as I'm struggling with a cold but what was already clear from the start was that this game is all chrome/history : if you removed every rule that was in there for historical reasons you'd end up with a 4-page rulebook. As such, the game is a bit quirky and far from elegant or streamlined, but all for a good cause : it's to immerse the gamer in that setting and time. I also have this nagging feeling that the game can hinge on a single role of the die, making it more an experience game than a duel of skill, but all that remains to be discovered in a future play.
2017-1-10 : A second play confirms my initial impression : lots and lots of chrome, yet still very playable in a long evening and due to the very limited yet very important die rolls more an experience than a balanced game for serious thinkers. Which in this case is a positive thing.

After a lot of discussion with other players, the designer and the developers, not to mention many times at the table; I am a fan.

There is a lot to like in the game and as a simulation of the English Civil War it plays as it is intended; a true challenge for two determined players. 

I do feel the game is marred by some omissions and unfortunate presentation choices in the rulebook, map and counter mix. Most of these have proved to be easily solved and with a little DIY I find the game a treat to play.

[2 plays] These are the most interesting things about UKC for me:

1) Generals can flip political control markers with movement points.  This makes the game extremely dynamic.  It also creates a nice tension between forming somewhat larger armies and smaller, more mobile ones.  

2) The counter mix is extremely limited and further limiting in the where you can bring specific units on.  The constant attrition and bringing of units back on creates some very interesting strategic and tactical decisions not available in other CDGs.

3) The "ace in the hole" mechanic is fantastic.  It allows you to hold back a card or two from round to round, but it's not just that, because it is an entire extra play above and beyond the normal hand.  This makes playing your ace in the hole card a difficult proposition, and cards that allow you to get an extra ace in the hole are a big deal.

4) The distinction between minor and supply fortresses is interesting.  Minor fortresses are useless, except for the fact that they never go out of supply and you have to besiege them to eventually flip the marker there.  So in order to isolate a large area, you're usually forced to either deal with some minor fortresses providing an easy path back to a supply fortress or deal with the much more difficult supply fortress directly.  

5) I love the thematic details in the game.  Things like the brigades are individually named (Assheton's brigade is lovingly known as the asshats and their battle prowess is much to be feared).  It's very rules-laden, but very well done.  It's quite something when a game slowly starts to get me interested in a particular period in history, especially since I couldn't really give a rat's ass about the English Civil War.

6) There are many occurrences that are once or twice in a game affairs like decisive battles.  When you get one it's something to truly be excited about.  The alternate history cards also provide just the right amount of uncertainty that you never know exactly how the overall flow of the game will play out.  

Overall, just a fantastic, tense affair for the 5+ hour game.  I really don't notice the time flying by, and I say that, because there are very few other wargames or games in general that I don't start to get bored of at the 5 hour mark.  

It will be very interesting to see if my feelings change at all over the next few plays.

A really excellent twist on the CDG model.  Things that I really like include the dwindling and irreplaceable force pools, the hidden army displays, and the "core card" idea that stabilizes the number of OPs available per turn.  I like the area control mechanism.  The art is uncluttered and pleasant.  Not an area of history I know too much about, but a winner of at a game.

RATING: 7.5
Good game. Just think of it as some combination of Hannibal: Roman vs. Carthage and Twilight Struggle. It's more complex than Hannibal and has more combat than Twilight Struggle. It all depends on what you are looking for in a card driven wargame. Personally, I'd rank it above other CDG but below Hannibal due to its lack of elegance. If you are not averse to plenty of chrome, or long games, then bump this rating up a point.

As far as strategy tips are concerned I’d say consider this an area control game with a bit of combat. A big battle strategy is just too expensive as far as cards are concerned, and it won't work out profitably most of the time anyway as the defender is able to evade and/or disperse and even when you finally do catch him his losses are usually small.

A great game that rewards a different way of playing. No "who's got the bigger stack?" here, but a lot of hesitations, question of precedence and chaos, 17th century style. So, that is why they fought this way!

Not easy to get into, but the history/rule ratio is still so high that it is worth it... (considering the luck factor, people looking to the "competitive game/rule" ratio might be a bit disappointed, but I am not sure why they are not playing only chess anyway)

Best game on the ECW available, at least at this level.
However to be honest none of the alternatives impress.

I had no problems with the rules and the chrome is necessary for the feel of the war. 

Local Notables are a nice touch, as are the recruiting restrictions.

I see Daniel Berger complaining not historical and talking of Hull falling.
If you allow Hull to be taken you are incompetent

As for historical accuracy - how someone who produced his laughable Gaul game can say that is a joke

UKC is just not that exciting.  Much of the combat and siege actions are at best 50-50 dice-offs due to the desertion and supply mechanics, and the events mainly involve flipping PC markers, which doesn't generate interest for me.  UKC may be historically accurate, but as a game, it just isn't going to hit the table again.

Something is lacking here.  there doesn't seem to be a compelling reason to move Charles south, so much of the history will be distorted (Scots destroyed by Charles, rather than taking over the North).

after three games, the feeling of control over events was missing.

Note that this rating is based purely on UKC as a game, not on my opinions of the designer's antics on BGG.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A heavily underrated game in my opinion. The chrome really adds to the game play and the subtle asymmetry works well. 

Combat is deliberately high risk and risk assessment and mitigation while trying to maintain a good position is crucial in this game. Between two reasonably competent players bluffing and double bluff really come into their own. It is possible to win even when failing on the battlefield.

The cards can swing fortunes and playing to that adds another layer of depth.

Just like the real thing.

in my opinion one of the best cdg games ever produced (far superior to Paths of glory, in comparison). 

It conveys a good perspective on the english civil war and, more generally, in the mechanics of waging war in the XVII century. 
Very clever graphic rendition, expecially for the map. Sound historical research on the matter (strategic/operational context). 

The rules are relatively concise, and generally well written. 

I'm a little concerned about the replayability of unhappy king charles, but, on the whole, this opus is both an intesting simulation and a good game to play

In a nutshell this is We the People with a lot of added chrome, but the atmosphere is great and it really does feel as though you're fighting the Civil War. You have to accept that pre-1645 nothing you do matters very much, that's the nature of the conflict being simulated here, this really was a war in which militia armies struggled to land a knockout blow. Like WtP most of the events are fairly banal although there are a few massively powerful ones especially in the Alternate History deck. The system could afford to lose a few rules, Charles Vasey is clearly an expert on the ECW and has designed a simulation as much as a game. Although I normally prefer dual-use cards, the single-use cards work well here in order to force you to move those lumbering armies at least occasionally. The story arc is also good as the war gathers pace from a quiet start into a violent middle. This is one of the most atmospheric CDGs around, I just wish the rules overhead were a little lighter.

Using the BGG rating scale here.  Though I can't say I would always want to play it (for topical reasons), UKC is an excellent game of the English Civil War.  The accompanying playbook does a marvelous job of making clear the "unusual" nature of 17th century warfare and the mindset players will need to take to win and the game itself delivers. A deep, rich game emphasizing subtlety over brute force...though the occasional haymaker can get thrown.

Unhappy King Charles takes its core system from We the People/Hannibal and applies it to the specifics of the first English Civil War. The designer has added a number of sub-systems and specific rules for this purpose - such as the Local Notables - and, I believe, has succeeded in creating a game of moderate complexity which imparts a considerable degree of historical flavour and recreates the key themes of its subject. Unhappy King Charles also works well as a game. 

There are some minor negative aspects of the game, but they detract only marginally from the whole. The rules book is poorly organised, making it time-consuming to learn the rules (much more so than, for example, the only marginally less complex Successors) and difficult to reference them during play. The rules are, perhaps, a little more complex than they should be (e.g. recruitment), which distracts from the play experience and adds to the time needed to complete a game. Indeed, the length of Unhappy King Charles inevitably means I will play it less often than shorter games such as Hannibal. The only other negative aspect of the game is that the last turn can degenerate into a race for points resulting in a focus on converting PCs in Economic Infrastructures and in any region where neither side has an unassailable position. 

If you have an interest in the period, I would strongly recommend Unhappy King Charles. It should provide a satisfying gaming experience (moderate element of chance, balanced victory conditions) and teach you something about the war in question. If you are new to 17th century warfare, then I would still commend the game to you, while advising that it has a relatively steep learning curve and some historically-justified quirks such as the difficulty in maintaining and moving large armies.

RATING: 5
This is on the heavy side of CDGs.  25 rules of meaty basic rules...
Usually I don't play such complex wargames (15-18 pages of rules being my standard limit).

There are 2 problems with the game:

- way, way, WAY too much of chrome that adds completely nothing (only annoyance) to the game.  Yes, that's why the flavour is rich, but the gaming itself is seriously hurt by many interesting (yeah, when you read a book on the subject...) nuances.  Reading the manual itself is almost monumental task, not mentioning actual understanding, remembering and applying correctly all the rules.  Even then constant check-ups in the manual accompany the games...

- length.  The game is looong.  Maybe you can cut the time with experience, but even then I can imagine 6-7h games (barring no automatic victory - which seems hard).  This is connected with the mentioned complexity of the rules and constant check-ups in the rulebook.

Cut out half of the rules and limit rulebook to 15 pages and you have a winner - BRILLIANT game that is as fun and playable as historically-sound and capturing character of the conflict it represents...

Still, taking into account all above complaints, the game plays much easier and smoothly that the rulebook would suggest and playing it is even FUN to some degree.
Or to some point I should say.  I mean, you can have real fun for a few turns but in the long run (11 turns is a full game length) you can feel the game is tedious or even futile/pointless.  It's just like painful and persistent wrestling or tug-of-war: you exert some influence here and me - here, you - here, me - I revert to previous state.  All that activity interrupted by some battles with modest casaulties and prolonging sieges.  Interesting stuff, that holds the interest, but not for so many hours.  In 4h game that'd be okay, but this game is just too long...

I might sound too critical, because playing UKC definitely wasn't a bad experience.  It was really interesting one with frequent moments of good fun.  But the game just _begs_ to be better (=more playable).  It's a real shame that a such nifty game will remain niche design, appreciated only by the most hardcore gamers willing to dedicate it their patience and time...

--

I particularly liked one mechanism: Core cards.  This could've been implemented in Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage making it even better game...

Finally got this to the table, over a year after picking it up on GMT's P500 scheme. Rating based on one (incomplete) solo play to get the rules - I'm regretting that it took me so long!

Pays an acknowledged debt to Mark Herman's genre-defining 'We the People' (in which it's hardly alone), but through a number of new elements and tweaks to the established order creates a game with its own unique feel.

Just maintaining an army in the field is a challenge in UKC. Similarly significant is the decision to attack (or if attacked, accept battle - you can always melt away if you don't fancy the odds), as recruitment is tight and units lost in battle can very rarely be recruited again. This creates an additional tension as (beyond the permanent loss of scarce units) the difficulty of rebuilding a damaged army means a bad battle loss can lose you a region for a while.

While in many games 'might is right' may be a good tenet, in UKC you really need to think about the size of your armies. Large armies are very powerful (should you actually be able to bring an enemy force to bear), but are hard to assemble, sluggish in movement, and can fall apart in the end of turn desertion phase. If you enjoy endlessly pumping out new armies Command and Conquer style this won't be for you, but if you think you'll enjoy fretting the delicate balance between recruiting smaller, nimbler but more disparate forces and giant, knuckle-dusting but (probably) temporary armies then you'll enjoy this tension in UKC (one of many). Always assuming you can spare the cards to recruit, of course...

Sieges are well implemented, with the tougher fortresses being very hard to crack, although through the 'Blockade and Siege' rule extended sieges are actually rewarded (to an extent at least - it's that balance thing again) in UKC, rather than penalised as in other games in the genre.

While the artwork, rules and supporting materials are first class, for me the only downside is that UKC doesn't benefit from GMT's recent 'deluxe' production quality. While I can vouch for the thick, well-laminated cards, hard-mounted, linen finished boards, stand-up leader counters and glossy, sturdy boxes of 'Washington's War' and the 'Wilderness War' reprint, UKC suffers a little in comparison in that it has a paper map, smallish, thin counters and thin cards that had warped before I'd even played the game. That said, none of this stopped me enjoying the game.

Looking forward to f2f play, which if I enjoy as much as I think I will, will see my rating go up.

No real opinion of this game after one play. It basically adapts the earliest CDG format (We the People) to the English Civil War. Lots of tweaks to the system. The name of the game seems to be army maintenance in the face of desertions and small losses. 

I don't recommend this unless you're well-read in the subject matter or have played a ton of We the People and Hannibal

Played the published version for the first time to see how it changed from my playtests many years ago.  I was pleased to find the period flavor remains strong, the asymmetries between the antagonists have been enhanced, and the pace has been increased.  A flavorful, competitive game on a meaty topic that can be knocked out in three hours - what more can you ask for?

First playthrough entailed much flipping through the rules and accidental cheating, but the game did a remarkable job of maintaining historical levels of force and activity.

Second playthrough was quicker and cleaner, though it's still what I would call a fiddly game. We switched sides, and this time the Royalist victory was even more pronounced, so we're both now on to solve the puzzle of how to win with Parliament.

Do make use of one of the very helpful player-aid sheets available here on B'G'Geek.

Wild and wooly affair, with the potential for absolutely extreme turnarounds.  I've played games where I thought I had the victory sewn up and then one decisive battle victory by my opponent changed everything. Departs from standard CDG mechanics in several quirky ways, but the departures serve to represent the historical reality very well.  The map and counter graphics don't work for me, but the addition of tiddlywinks for control markers helps immensely.  Not for players who like high levels of predictability and control in their games, but mana for those who love games that produce surprising and memorable stories.

What a great CDG, even if it is a bit fiddly. I had to learn the hard way that this is more of an area control game than it is a war game. The key is to use your troops to annoy your opponent, not to win some major battle. Your goal is to flip political control markers to your side on a determined amount of areas to win the game. If you lose focus of that, and start doing things like growing a big force so you can successfully besiege fortresses, it will be game over before you know it.

3 / 5 - Good.

There's a great deal here to admire and enjoy. The basic CDG model is well-implemented and augmented by the added nerves of limited troop pool and unexpectedness of the alt-history cards. Tactically it rarely fails to provide interest or challenge. But I'm held back from a higher rating by the fiddle-factor: it's not *massively* complex, just excessively so with pages of rules devotes to minor issues like chain of command in stacks and niggling exceptions.

A good game with some interesting mechanics and flavor.  Not sure why it pays off to seige stuff as it seems overly hard given the fortress levels and attrition at your heels.  But, perhaps, that's not really the big point of the game.  Events seem lackluster as to their power and affect.  But, that's ok, I suppose.  "gotcha" events that destroy boards aren't that realistic either.

RATING: 8.3
First and most of all, for me the game gives a great narrative. For someone more familiar with English Civil War this must be even better. I like the maneuvers, and planning entire campaigns in advance after seeing the cards at the beginning of the round. 
But there are also some issues. I’d love to see the rules streamlined when it comes to desertion and recruitment. In my opinion it hurts the game – the system is not bad, but if you play the game only once in a while (since it is quite long it’s hard to find time and determined adversary) you can’t get used to such rules on the level where you do them automatically. That element is simply not elegant, however I see that it is integral part of the gameplay – you have to learn how it works and exploit it.

CDG with PC markers that is more complicated than Hannibal and Washington's War/We the People. Too "fiddly" for my taste.  The rule book is not well organized.

I like the more elegant forbearers  "We the People" and Hannibal much more.

A top notch gaming experience this, as all the best CDGs are. The manual seemed daunting at first but the game settled down around the half way point. Despite the complexity, I found the manual to be one of the least ambiguous I have ever seen, so full marks there. The game is a tense, tough struggle, always feeling you were one good hand away from winning, and one bad hand away from being completely out of it. The end game seemed like a bit of a rush for political control, but until that point this was a brutally effective at what it set out to do. Super.

The only downside of this one is the length of play.  I can't imagine finishing an entire 11 turn game in less than 5-6 hours, though I suppose it could be done with decisive players. The problem is, the game gives you a lot of interesting choices, so it's hard to dive into things and play quickly.  It has a lot of neat concepts and it feels like it captures the spirit of the time period.  There are a few "zinger" cards that can be a bummer, but if you play for the long haul they can be dealt with.

RATING: 8.8
UPDATE: A funny thing happened on the way to the beheading. On my second play, the game clicked into place...finally. Perhaps I finally understood all of the interlocking mechanisms and the incredible detail involved. Perhaps it's also because I've done well in both my games, and the tension ratcheted up to unbearable levels. I'm just fascinated that what I thought at 8:00pm in a recent game (a slightly fiddly though historically faithful series of systems) caught fire and blossomed into a masterpiece at 9:00pm. Some wargames I admire and respect, but would never be able to teach. UKC! even I could teach, not because it's simple but because it all, a few niggles notwithstanding, makes sense. And playing the game is one hell of an education! This is a model game for a lot of chrome successfully and accurately applied. 

It's a 7, barely a 7 and movable, but it should easily have been an 8.  Like others, I'm sure, I'm wondering what the developer was doing allowing so many fiddly bits into the main design (as opposed to making them optional rules.) Vasey actually has a fun and fascinating, "We the People-esque" design here, only he can't seem to let it alone.  There's always a tipping point that I am particularly sensitive to with wargames nowadays where I feel the designer is going above and beyond to clutter and chrome up his designs, perhaps due to overindulgence or perhaps due to fear of what the old crusty grognards on CSW would say if he didn't.  But regardless, UKC is well-paced and less complicated than the rulebook would have one think, despite some alarmingly preventable usability and interface issues; I just wish the various elements were more intuitive, but then I'm always wishing that of wargames.

First Impressions after two plays:

Game looks very promising. The concept of local notables which cannot be killed by a simply walkover of a big army and which make their presence felt without moving might set a new standard to simulate local dependencies.

The organisation of the rules could have been better, the terms and wording more sharp and precise, but usually the intention of the rules is clear. I think that much complaining about overchromed rules comes from this disorderly presentation, because some integral parts of the game look like isolated attachments.
Some production 'disfunctionalities' make live miserable (No off-map Scotland box, placement areas of local notables in rulebook instead event card, number of areas in region/needed to control not printed on map etc.).
Somewhat exemplarily for this sloppy approach are Charts&Tables, which start halfway on a page with the end of the designer notes.

**********

Update:
Excellent game.
Somewhat questionable looks the NMA atomic bomb event, which is totally scripted and alters massively the situation on the game board. At least it keeps the game simple without need of some sort of war-status or a stream of connected events showing the radicalisation of the war. Hopefully the artifical effects on play will be living-ruled out (e.g. manipulating Fairfax in the Unemployment Box in preparation for the event). Nevertheless it feels somewhat wrong with that many may-be negative effects on the parlamentarian cause and that much preparation the parlamentarian player has to put into it to avoid disaster.

RATING: 9
Excellent historical and quick-playing CDG. There are some complexities in the rules (recruitment especially) that take some time to get down, but once you've got them, this game moves fast. 

Fun, evocative of the historical challenges, and none of the Events/Ops choice silliness of other CDG. 

NOTE: I was a playtester on UKC, so take my comments and rating with that in mind.

A game that is growing on me more and more. There is an initial learning curve as it looks like a cookie cutter CDG, but it is not. 

The flavour of the era is captured nicely along with it's difficulties. Armies are hard to raise, slow to move and waste away quickly. Use them at the right time them they can be devastating, at other times they are a waste of time and scarce resources.

Replayability is excellent, as there are many different ways to fight the war, in fact avoiding actual pitched battles can be the best thing to do, fight a manoeuvre war in an era when it is difficult to do so. "What-if" cards add new possibilities in different events during the game; the war has not even started but will do so in the first turn, when the war starts is another strategic decision for one of the players.

This is a game where analysis paralysis could be a problem; there are many choices of what to do, each with advantages and disadvantages.

Based on a playtest game with the designer. I am not a fan of card driven games but for a pre-modern, area-control situation it could be adequate, and there are some interesting variations on the theme, such as large armies moving more slowly, and the fascinating political context of the Guelf Revolution. I could be tempted to get a copy.

RATING: 8
Card driven wargame about the English Civil War. It's quite different to most wargames, where armies grow and fade across a map which, at least initially, has no frontline or secure territory.  I have a concern that the main thrust of the game seems to about grabbing Political Centres and the tactic of denying these centres to the Parliamentarians seems a much easier (and safer) choice for the Royalists than going for an earlier military victory - rendering the game not much more than a convoluted, albeit entertaining, area control game. This is a real shame as there is a good battle system and the early manoeuvring and territory grab is really engaging. More plays may prove my initial thoughts wrong and Unhappy King Charles will climb the ratings - I hope so as I found lots to like.

I must mention complexity. The plethora of rules (and flavour procedures) turn out to be simpler than first looks would suggest and the 29 page rule book is easy to digest and reference during play. After our first game we had no questions or ambiguity about any of the rules, which is highly commendable.

Another flip-flop, political control marker based, area majority, card driven game. I have a natural affinity to wanting to like games in this niche but this one fell flat for a couple of reasons. Firstly, the theme is not one I'd naturally gravitate to, but I didn't think the cards, map or rule chrome helped get me there either. I could just as easily be playing in the 1740s or any other era. Secondly, it didn't feel like the game needed as much chrome as it does so it's a hard game to read up and get into. Most of the chrome also feels insignificant and non game defining (eg the 57 rules for placing brigades, the single maritime link). Once you're into the game, like most others in this genre there's a million options and the first plays are just trying things out, with the allure being that multiple play is required to sort out better vs worse strategies. But the first play felt flat (too much chrome, too much flip-flopping, too many potentially decisive battles evaded, close battles too random) so there's little desire to invest further in the game.

Technically, a single deck single use CDG, which means that a lot of your events will end up in your opponents hand and never happen. Tough. Suck it up. If he has your events he's not getting his own and will have his own problems.

CDG of the First English Civil War with the regionalism of the conflict emphasised and few troops able to transverse the board. I suspect it favours the Royalists as they survive most of the games I play. Nicely themed woodcut cards, but the map and counters are overly colourful.

Finally got this to the table - took around 4.5 hours with a Parliamentarian victory (I think His Majestic Highness got captured during the relief of York). Whilst the game does a great job of presenting the First Civil War the game needs all it's special rules to do this  and at times it's a real headache. Its a keeper but i think it'll be at least a year before I play it again.

Excellent game. Models pre-industrial war in some novel and interesting ways, neatly avoiding the trap of those game where the best strategy is to build a monster stack and steamroller all in your path. Here, big armies are hard to move and fall to pieces very swiftly. Balancing the big battalions against the need to take and hold territory is a great puzzle for the player.

Very good CDG - I enjoy it a lot more than We the People.  There's a lot of that tug of war in getting political control markers on the board and preventing isolation, but the theme really comes through.  The cards here are just events, ops, or battle bonuses  - no combined event-or-ops cards like most CDG's. And most events only work for one player, but you can play enemy events for a limited 1-op with no event effect triggering, which I tend to prefer over the "this event will happen whether you like it or not, you just choose when it will happen in the sequence of playing your cards." There are just a few Mandatory events that are like that, and are more like triggers for the next phase of the game.  You always have a 1 and a 2 ops cards, so even if you draw a bunch of events for your enemy, you can still do some good things a turn.

Difficult to amass and move big armies, relatively easy to evade a bigger army (1/3,1/2,or2/3 chance depending on whether your general is more or less skilled than the attacking general), or even just disperse your weaker army (remove it from the board and get half of the units back for free next turn), so big battles are rare, and big losses from battles are even rarer.  

Bigger armies constantly lose units to attrition every turn, and it's hard to get reinforcements out to your generals when they're away from your homebases, which both feels very thematic and makes for interesting planning about how you array your recruits - you kind of have to keep running back to recruiting spots to stock up. Bombardment of fortresses is also really fun - it usually takes 2 to 5 bombardment activations to siege and capture a fortress, so it's likely another enemy general will come and attack you directly during that and break your siege, or you may even decide you need to drop the siege early to go defend somewhere else. It feels almost like a game of Tag.

Criticisms: I thought the rules are well-written and clear, but they are not well organized. It's kind of a mish-mash of turn sequence and describing each part in detail, and is hard to find specifics. And there's just a good bit of fiddly details that really could have been highlighted better or presented in a way that pops out at you. One example is how Royalists recruiting spots are different whether it's the recruitment phase, dispersed units, or recruiting during campaign. It's just pretty easy to make a mistake and recruit brigades where you shouldn't.  
The Major/Minor Campaign cards, which let you activate 2-3 generals regardless of their skill level or size, can be really strong compared to the normal back-and-forth of 1 card, 1 activation, at a time. While it's fun to have these big moments where a player can do a lot without the other player being able to respond, it can feel unfair if only one player is dealt all or most of these.  There are other cards that are of course better (3 ops clearly better than a 1 ops), but there's enough of these that it kind of comes out in the wash, but the Campaigns are rare enough that how they are dealt can be swingy.  My only other criticism is I wish it just played a bit faster.  The turn sequence could have been simplified a bit to streamline the upkeep.

Another purchase that was obvious looking back at my re-enacting history.
With that in mind I of course am proned to be very critical.
In advance I allready had my doubts about the 'what if' rules.
After receiving the game, I was not to happy with the collour of the royalist banners. I think they should be red, but accept this collour might be better suited for gameplay...stil...

A game I can not help but like for the theme alone.
Enjoyed playing it, but figure I have to give it a few more goes before I play it without any errors.

Very clever game. It has a relatively simple base system, but there are quite a lot of small details to remember. As a result, it will take a bit of time to learn; those who prefer a streamlined game over historical accuracy should probably stay away. The rules give the war a very distinctive feel, with intermittent military campaigning, jockeying for political influence and high rates of desertion. I was put off by the lack of an events/ops choice on each card, but now realise that a) there are still plenty of difficult choices anyway and b) the limited number of ops cards is the factor that severely restricts extended military actions, which is one of the most intersting aspects of the game. I really like the way isolation of PCs works, forcing conflict around the various local power centres that supply your PCs. I also like the difficult choices about which area of England should receive your limited resources.

This is one of my favorite maps, but reading the deck-building rules alone gives me a headache. Victor Fernandez's comments also seem right to me.

I look forward to a game one day of greater scope--that is more politico-religious-ethnic, more leaders a la King's War, and covering events in Scotland and Ireland.

Rating based on one partial play. 

Unlike many CDGs, this is played much more on the map than in the cards. So, while you get less dedcision-making excitement than say, Paths of Glory, you do get a genuine boardgame. 

I suspect that this game grows on you, and that the end game is quite tense

RATING: 9
When I first heard the title I think I laughed out loud.  Ridiculous!

Yeah, but it's a fantastic game.  I'd say, in my experience, it's one of the tightest, most well-designed, well-themed, best produced CDGs I've ever had the pleasure of playing.

How do you know you have a great wargame?  One way is the massive interest generated in the history of the conflict depicted.  I went from knowing nothing about the ECW to reading and researching on my own.  Kudos to Mr. Vasey!

Only one thing keeps it from joining Twilight Struggle as a TEN -- I want to play it more just to make sure.  In fact I'm going to go set it up right now.

A subtle CDG which is low on bloodshed but high on finesse. Represents the English Civil War well and offers tough decisions throughout. Well done!

RATING: 9
Interesting.  Conceptually close to predecessor [i]We the People[/i], but more like [i]Hannibal[/i] in broad terms of execution - by which I mean the basic structures are well intact, but when you kick the tires a few little flaws fall out.  Interface issues with the map, counters, and displays are disappointing, but even more surprising is less-than-precise language in what are otherwise well-done rules.  All in all, it's worth working out, and I look forward to getting playtime way the hell down.

[b]Update:[/b] (2010.12.17) The "flaws" and "imprecision" are clarified or merely vanish.  The game is superb and tense, though I do wonder if it's balanced against Parliament... some of the late war Royalist events seem uncommonly good, especially given Charles was on his last rope.

[b]Update:[/b] (2012.04.03) With the rollback changes suggested elsewhere (undoing some late revisions) I feel the balance edges back towards the middle.  A nearly perfect game gets nearly perfecter!

Very good design of the English Civil War. Borrows many game concepts from We the People, but introduces just enough new twists to make this game much more interesting than WtP.
Important new game elements include Limited Ops for discards, Local Notables (!), and Alt-History-Cards.
Recommended.

RATING: 7
Mmmmmm, have mixed feelings about this one. Some elements of the game are great (like the combat system, the siege mechanics, the "what if..." cards) while others are too fiddly (recruitment, control...).
I think the worst is that feeling you keep when you play it: this game shouldn't have been a CDG. Most of the deck are generical "2/3/4... ops action" cards, and many of the other cards have also generical (and clone-type) effects wich ruin the flavour

RATING: 9
Rating updated after more plays. Game is rich in history, and the graphical presentation is amongst the best I've seen.

While there is a lot to absorb here, the taut rulebook - coupled with a playbook that serves as a (new) model of near perfection - makes things very manageable. No errata to speak of either (amazing for a CDG).

Excellent design (with lots of chrome nuggets) w/team development that conveys smooth and tense play. A whole host of options is offered to both sides, and balance + replayability is very good.

UKC! has opened up a whole new era (ECW) for me, and the game is just plain fun to play. Well done lads!

Definitely getting a feel for this. Took it away with us Xmas 2012 and played the first turn as a try out. This pointed up many inconsistencies, which, frankly, were down to my misunderstanding of the rules. Having played but a single move, I can see the cock ups I perpetrated, but also the sheer depth of the game. 

I think we'll be back to this one in short order, so it might end up more highly rated. Certainly a great rarity - the ECW covered as a board game. Hard to imagine, but it looks like it works.

Edit: It's a jewel. I'm deeply impressed. A game that rewards replaying. What more can I say?

Edit 2: played it with t'wife on holiday a week back, and I'm still well impressed. Her, less so, as she did struggle with some of the rules and concepts, which I put down to the fact that I'm fairly shite at explaining rules. Still, We played 6 moves, which isn't bad although I have to say that this is definitely a game where your gameplan *must* be in place when you start, and where you must be extremely careful about your recruitment, lest you end up with armies waiting for generals who can't get started.

Overall, I rate this extremely highly, so I'll be looking for a local opponent to try it out with.

Finally got a first play in.  My initial reaction is very positive, but I'm waiting to get in a second play at least.  There are a lot of rule exceptions to work through, so the first play was a bit long and rulebook reference intensive.  But the play was very solid and I'm eager for another go.

RATING: 8
Unhappy King Charles ! est un jeu qui se distingue par sa complexité, due à de nombreuses exceptions et à des règles innovantes qui nécessitent un temps d'adaptation (désertion, notables locaux, absence de flexibilité des armées, etc.). 

Par contre, il se caractérise aussi par son respect scrupuleux de la réalité historique, et j'en garde le sentiment d'avoir vraiment été plongé dans cette période troublée (et bordélique) de l'histoire de l'Angleterre.

Au final, un excellent jeu, une fois absorbé le corpus de règles quelque peu indigeste.

RATING: 8
At first I didn’t like this game, and it took me several goes to feel comfortable with the rules and the system. I did several solo play throughs, which I had to abandon fairly early on as I forgotten, misunderstand or just plain missed one of the many ‘chrome’ type rules.

Examples of chrome type rules are:

•	Slightly different recruitment rule for both sides and depending whether recruitment was done in the recruitment phase or via a recruitment card
•	Different movement rates depending on the size of the army
•	Some Generals can command more troops than others 
•	Some General can be subordinate to some generals but not to others
•	Slightly different siege rules depending on the type of fortress

However despite my early frustration I stuck at it because:

a) Friends recommended it
b) Subject matter (very few games on the English Civil War)
c) I just shelled out a reasonable amount to money to buy it

I'm very glad I did. There is a lot of chrome/fiddly things to get your head round, but without them it would just be a rather bland wargame. As it is stands, it really feels as though I'm playing history. The game really does comes alive once you’ve fully absorbed the rules. And it plays very quickly, and even when playing it solitaire I find I’m eager just to play one more turn before I go and sort the kids out, make dinner, have a shower etc

If you do play this game I recommend you invest in reading about the war and then you may appreciate why things are as they are in the game. Without a bit of understanding about the subject you may find the game a bit frustrating.

Excellent treatment of the topic. Learning curve is slightly steep but worth the effort. Common complaints I see here is that the game is "dull"-- and that I don't understand at all. The game is unbelievably, at times frighteningly tense-- a single bad decision (especially with regards to dispersal) can be catastrophic, and that's rather lovely I think.

The way counters obstruct the names on the map and info is not present on the map,seem like fairly large oversights.  Mechanics are historically appropriate, but I didn't get a sense of tension over its bloated length, due to it being a game that will almost always go the distance. Moving armies and raising troops is difficult (moreso for the Parliament Player than the Royalist) and the limited uses for cards made play feel similar each game. I can't imagine anyone having a memorable play of this. I certainly haven't. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
One of the best CDGs out there.  This has a lot of great nods to the era.  It's impossible to keep large armies in the field, it's incredibly difficult to move around and force decisive battles, and local political structures have a way of continuously forcing the popular support back to their side.  There's also small rules differences between the factions which have outsized implications that make the two factions quite different to play. It's a great model of the period.

Gameplay wise, although it's a wargame, the battles are mostly useful as a service for manipulating the political situation.  This is a necessary step for simulating something as complex as the English civil war, as this is at least as much a battle for hearts and minds as it is a pure military dominance.  It's a great model of warfare as an extension of politics.

I do have a minor quibble with the use of cards.  Many crucial events of the war won't happen, as if you get one of your opponent's events, you can discard it for a minor operation.  It's not quite as good for you as a full operation card, but it can be crippling to your opponent not to get the event on the card.  Major cards and events can breeze by without note as they just happen to get drawn by the wrong side.  Other games solve this by having individual decks ([gameid=7480]), by automatic triggering of opponent events ([gameid=12333]), or by negotiation to get your events played ([gameid=17392]).  As it is, the game is very board-focused, which robs it of some potential sources of flavor and accuracy.  But this is a minor quibble -- the game as is is very good.

8 is for the interest of what I see and the period. CDG's are perfect for games like these, and the ECW is a fascinating subject, even for Americans, which, btw, the ECW IS part of American History, and is the root of all of our American History, and the impetus for the Constitution and Declaration of Independence.

If you have not seen the BBC series on the English Civil War and Starkey's Monarchs, you have really missed some great stuff.

Also go get the book 'Cousin's Wars'.

BTW, I have ordered it on the P500.

RATING: 9.5
Two plays raise sentiments similar to Wilderness War, except that area control looms much larger here, pushing it more towards Hannibal and Washington's War - to mention two games that are substantially lighter but also less deep.

Heavy on the brain. E.g. how to play the map will take considerable time to get one's head round - and that's before we enter the intricate system of recruitment and deployment points, or the added chrome of minor forces (Scots and Irish) or historic personage. 

Cards mostly on the safe and sane side, though the 'make your opponent discard 2 cards' are brutally effective to cause major mayhem on the board without a chance of swift retribution. 

Favourite innovation: 'decisive victories' which require competent placing of those familiar 'add 2 to combat roll' cards, but reward the drawing of two extra strategy cards to implement straightforwardly. Love this.

Major downside for such a brilliant game is that its playing time can't easily fit into a weekday evening.

I've only played 4 turns consisting solely of early war cards, so I fully expect this rating to go up when I finally get a full game in.

Another CDG triumph for GMT Games. I played as Parliament and the first three turns were a combination stalemate and drubbing as King Charles and Prince Rupert had their way in the North and took out several Local Notables. I foolishly found myself in two battles where Essex lost 2 brigades! 

Everything turned around on the fourth turn. An excellent hand (mostly operations cards plus a Minor Campaign card) allowed me to seize the initiative and I didn't let go. Essex caught the King in the Midlands and won a major victory which resulted in me drawing the City of London card randomly from the discards, delivering a further operations card and a Major Campaign card! The Royalists didn't stand a chance. By the end of the turn I had dispersed the King's army, had my way with the North, and even seen off a mini-offensive by Hopton in the South. 

The Royalists did, however, have the Queen in York with two brigades, so they had the seeds of a comeback which I'm sure would have unfolded to their benefit once the cards turned against me. Still, an exhilarating game that I can't wait to play again.

Laurel and I really love card driven wargames (CDGs), but we really didn't warm to this one. On the surface, it's a decent enough game and the production is excellent. Unfortunately, key elements of the game were for us not that inspiring:
1) We didn't like that cards were either events or points, rather than both (as they are in most other CDGs). This resulted in there being very little hand management and few tough decisions, which for us are some of the best elements of CDGs.
2) We found most of the strategy card events pretty uninspiring.
3) We felt that there were a lack of options within the game, particularly if, as happened, we drew lots of strategy cards with our opponent's events on them.

On the plus side, the combat system was very good. Unfortunately this wasn't enough to stop us from selling it.

Lowered my rating slightly after my PBEM opponent and I gave up late-war due to lack of interest. 

The game is a bit too random and arbitrary for my taste, and there doesn't seem to be much in the way of long-term strategy that one can pursue, unlike For the People or Wilderness War. 

Battles seem to be essentially pointless and rarely if ever decisive, which may in broad strokes have some historical validity, but don't expect to see a Naseby or Marston Moor changing the course of the war.

To be fair, my understanding of this war is not terribly deep, so I may be missing something in terms of strategy.

RATING: N/A
I was really looking forward to this one, but my excitement took a huge nose-dive when it finally arrived.  I already have plenty of wargames with 25 pages of rules sitting around not getting played -- I was planning on this being something else, more in the same vein as We The People in scope, the game it touted as its inspiration.  I hate to admit it, but I basically just threw it on the trade pile without a further thought.  It might turn out to be a decent game, but it's not what I thought I was buying and I don't have room on my shelf for what it turned out to be.

A more pretty variant on Carcassone, with more intuitive farm rules (farmers are now hunters that score points for animals in their field). It feels quite different than regular Carcassone with the prospector pieces forcing everyone to play in a relatively small play area. You could play it more like regular Carcassone without the prospectors, though.

A nice addition to the Carcassone cannon. A couple of different mechanics to points scoring to ring the changes. Farmers are now hunters, and score for animals instead of fields, also there are now surveyors who can massively skew points as they travel across the board! Ooooh...and the meeples have top hats!! Top hats!!

RATING: 5.5
I had high hopes for this one.  I liked the notion of driving the tile placements 'westward', but the advance can be so relentless, that some scoring options simply can't materialize in time.  Add to that hunting score and the dominance that it can have on the final outcome and you're left wondering why anyone built anything as they followed manifest destiny.  By the game's reckoning, settlers should have hunted the animals to extinction, then considered settling - maybe.  

The basics of Carcassonne have a great appeal and finding a new twist on them is a real game design challenge.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
More bloodthirsty than the original, which is great when you're in the mood for Carc but want a little more conflict. Just make sure you use the updated rules, though!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The tiles expand easterly only.  Consequently play seems quicker and Meeples other than farmers are removed as they are left behind.  Probably the most fun of all the Carcassonne games.  I would have preferred Doris's graphics however.  The NW graphics were more like those of the inferior Hunters and Gatherers.  The animal icons were too indistinguishable and other illustrations too computerised.

Had high hopes for this game and felt disappointed, maybe I need another play of it however had two questions.  Can a player lay tiles that expand past the top and bottom of the game boarder.  Secondarily, can you place trappers on newly played tiles east of the surveyors.  You can place tiles to the east of the surveyors to grow the area of the trappers you have already placed, however can you place new trappers?

I don't like this variation of [i][gameid=822][/i].  

The Surveyors advance so fast that the game seems to come down to whomever draws the best tiles which complete features to score.  The Cloister equivalents (called Farms - whose idea was that?) hardly ever score unless you have an open hole to drop them in.

I will play it a few more times before making up my mind about it, but I suspect it will just end up sitting on my shelf and rarely played and might even suffer the same fate as [i][gameid=21385][/i], which also had meeples being removed and the winner being the one who drew the tiles to complete the vacated features.

Surveyors pretty much ensure that the only long-term strategy you can take is to add to your trappers' hunting grounds in the east.  Otherwise, you are stuck with the luck of the draw (as usual), but have *much* less time to finish anything large with your random tiles.  Also, the inclusion of fewer city tiles makes building roads a much better option.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The Surveyors really drive the game toward the "west" which is neat. They also really make building large cities risky. Changes the dynamics of Carc from building and stealing more toward the grabbing of points, and taking chances behind the "front line." In the end, though, forces instant scoring as the only reliable source of points, and therefore makes the game one of hoping for the right tile. Maybe the rumored designer's original rule of not allowing insta-scoring might make it better....

New World adds a clever 'go west' mechanic to Carcassonne, which suits the theme perfectly. All tiles must be played in a generally westward direction, and the new Surveyor meeples move one column to the west with every completed feature. Any meeple that is left behind when the surveyors pass is removed from the board. This is the most advanced stand-alone Carcassonne game. A skilled player will easily leave an inexperienced opponent in the dust.

Got via math trade. This game suits my Carc playing style--I get anxious when cities/roads/etc go unfinished for a long time, and the advancing surveyors make sure you finish your projects and get out quickly. I like it, along with the added 'trapper' mechanic a'la the hunters from Carc H$G.

An ok game. With 4 players, the surveyors get too easily ahead of the map and we eventually cannot score the bonuses. At 2-3 players it was fine.

Rio Grande Games amended the rules. If there are no tiles westward of the surveyors, don't move them. I believe that if we can't move any of the surveyors, then, it does not trigger the removal of the settlers east of them.

Plays really much like original carcassonne eventhough there's a new theme and one new feature. The new feature is settlers who move west during the game and eat up unfinished building projects. This makes game more heated and finishing cities and other building projects hard.Farms (=church in original game) are especially hard to finish and thus almost obsolete in this version. Luck element is also significantly higher.

Is a variety for original game but nothing that would take Carcassone brand to a higher level.

This one is more challenging than the original Carcassonne due to the "leading edge" mechanic. It's tough to get used to, but it's a cool twist on the Carcassonne mechanics.

The main effect is that it makes each meeple feel more urgent, since there is essentially a time-limit on finishing the roads and cities.

I'm a fan of Carcassonne, so I do enjoy this game.  My only disappointment was that it's really not all that different from regular Carcassonne.  Maybe that's OK, but with the vastly different look, I was expecting the gameplay to be different was well.

Jolly Carcassonne variant with a rather more believable theme. Lots of backstabbing as the tiles roll out. You need the FAQs though. we opted to play with Mike Siggins which has much the same effect.

This is a great variation on the standard Carcassonne franchise, and definitely breathes a new life into my desire to play either this or the standard game.  The extra mechanic of the moving surveyors definitely encourages the building of smaller, more manageable cities and roads, and less of the behemoth 20+ tile cities that are prevalent in some standard Carcassonne games.

Another great [gameid=822] game.

Carcassonne refreshed. Quicker and more dynamic. Without building huge "metropolys" - everyone have to score as fast as possible and go forward.  But there is something wrong with some rules (see. http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/337435.) It is almost impossible to score a farm.
Want to play more, but I think it is not tested enough.
Still "Hunters and Gatherers" are my favourite Carcassonne version.

This is a fun game. I like the action and movement of the survaers west to keep the game moving. It gets dull after you draw the same kinds of tiles over and over again. It also gets dull when you draw tiles that just dont fit the plan your trying to make happen. Everyone who played it seemed to like it. I think if we had more people playing it would have been more fun.

RATING: 6
Didn't work with five. A couple of nice ideas with the starting area and surveyors, but with five players they move too fast and it's almost impossible to score anything larger than about three tiles, and tile draw becomes even more random. Didn't go down well, but as I find Carc with more than three not so great anyway, I'll reserve judgement (and rating) until I've tried it with fewer players.

edit: tries with two and three, and while it's clearly better with this number it's still not as good as other Carcs I own so due to space I sold it on.

I do not care for the Surveyors.  Basically you place a meeple on a feature and hope to draw the right tile to finish it.  A couple rounds go by without the right feature and the surveyors kick you off.  Then someone else draws it and gets the points.  Where's the game in that?

     A tile placement game much like the original, in which players take turns drawing a tile, revealing it, then placing it onto the growing map.  As with the original, features such as trails, towns, and fields (analogous to roads, cities, and farms) must match.
     The most significant difference is the surveyors.  The map begins along the northeastern coast of the US.  It expands westward from there.  Two surveyor meeples begin on the east coast.  As a player scores a feature, one surveyor is moved one tile westward.  If one is further ahead, the second surveyor must move west to catch up.  If, when a feature is scored, the meeple on that feature is in the same north-south column as any surveyor(s), it earns a bonus of 4 points.  As the surveyors move westward, any meeples left on incomplete features (except for trappers) east of the surveyors are removed from the board and returned to the players.  A meeple may be placed eastward of the surveyors but it will be removed if it hasn't scored by the time either surveyor moves west.

There are a few scoring twists:
Trails:  Some having trading posts which provide an extra two points.
Farms:  Similar to the monks of the original, a meeple is placed onto a tile which must be surrounded by tiles on all sides to score 9 points.
Trappers:  Like the farmers of the original.  These score one point for each animal sign on a tile in their field.  

My sole complaint is that the animal signs and trading posts are difficult to discern.  Carc Hunters & Gatherers did a much better job with distinguishing these features.

This Carcassonne version has a very nice element to it, namely the pioneers that keep moving west and force the players to finish their "projects" are risk leaving them unfinished. The aim is to finish just when both pioneers are on the same column as you, so you can earn big bonuses. I like this game a lot, but I do think that this version plays better with 4 or 5 players and perhaps somewhat less with 2 or 3. A nice alternative for the original, will play again. Trading away to make room for other games.

We needed another Carcassonne game, and here it is!  Players place tiles, and optionally pawns, to score points for completing roads, buildings, etc.  We all know how to play, so how is this different?  This is not Carcassone of the Languedoc, this is Carcassonne, Virginia.  We're now in the Americas in the 17th century, and there is now Lewis and Clarke - two surveyor pawns - who move west and force pawns to be scored, or be removed for no points.  The rest is pretty much the same game.  The surveyors certainly give Carcassonne a different tempo, with different pressures and tactics coming into play.  I enjoyed it - lovely art on the tiles, but the animals are almost impossible to see.  Worth a look, but I don't need to own it.

Well, it's still Carcassonne, but this variant seems a little underdone.  Could have used some more playtesting, perhaps, or at least better proofreading.  Update: Works much better if you prohibit placing followers in just-completed features.

RATING: 10
It's a more goal oriented version of Carcassonne, where you have time limits to complete your cities and roads, with the prospector mechanic pushing you constantly to the west.  If you like Carcassonne but wanted a little more strategy, this game is awesome!  Still as calm to play, but more to do!

This is Carcassone with an tiny extra element of complexity: Every time someone scores, two masterMeeples advance on the board. If you have a meeple BEHIND both the mastermeeples it is removed without scoring.

I am not a big Carcassonne fan (played it a lot when I first entered the hobby), but I would always like to Play New World over the orginial, since it has a bit more to offer. I also like that the extra element is destructive, and gives you a race against time aswell.

Nice variant, but a bit too competative for my taste. The landowners that keep moving to the right really keep from building a bigger city. And that is really what I like about carc. Not for me, but I would recommend it to someone who hasn't played any carcassonne before.

It's a shorter, faster paced version.

RATING: 4
An odd duck. 

The moving surveyor gimmick in this one means that you can't really build anything too big, but you can try to sneak in behind the line to finish/scavenge something before the next score/move. So, cities and the abbey (or whatever the 3x3 thing is) are hard to come by. Animals in the field typically end up being the biggest score (depending on how vigilant you are).

So, the basic Carcassonne game mechanics are retained with the sole addition of the frontier limitation of the surveyors. There's simply not enough new here and without any additional modifications to mechanics or scoring the game really feels half-baked, or maybe not baked at all.

An odd duck.

I really like the design and artwork.  The surveyors make for a new twist to the Carcassonne concept.

We've played it a few times and like it.  I'm aware that some of the harder core Carcassonne fans have dismissed this version but my wife, who's as hard core a "Carc" fan as anyone I know, liked this game and enjoys playing it.  So, I'd say that validates my belief that this is a worthwhile game to play for Carcassonne fans.

Ultimately, we still choose the regular Carcassonne (with expansions) over this game.

A gift from our 2008 Secret Santa - thanks!

We have one play in, and despite much confusion over surveyor movement and scoring, we enjoyed it.  This one's a bit of a brain burner, like The Discovery.  The artwork on the tiles is definitely the best of the series.

(As with Ark Of the Covenant, I've edited the title so that it's listed with the rest of the series in my collection.)

I like it, but I feel like things score so fast, it is often luck as to whether you can get the right piece fast enough.  Eliminating fast scoring or at least adding one of the tile variants might help, but as it is, I think I'd rather play vanilla carcassonne.  That's fast too, but feels like you have way more control

Another very good looking Carcassonne version. The art in this looks more realistic than usual. I really like the colors and style. The gameplay adds a few twists to original Carcassonne. The timing of scoring is very important, getting the bonus of the big meeples is very important.

Carcassonne with an unforgiving element.  Much easier to run away with this game than the base game.  We've had games where I lapped the scoretrack twice, and had differences in score of greater than 50 points.  Still a big luck factor with the tile drawing, but a little strategy can go much farther in this game than base 
Carcassonne.

Having played the original Carcassonne only once I dont think I can give a good comparison, however I do like the theme of this game much better, and the roles tend to make more sense to me. The ending of the game gets a little boring with two players, but as you add more the fun multiplies.

If you are a huge Carcassonne fan (and own all of the games), you will not find much new here at all.  Of course, you'll probably still get it like I did because you are a fan.

Be warned: This version is the most cutthroat version of Carcassonne I have ever played.  The addition of the surveyors can remove your meeples!

The regular Carcassonne was fast but this one is so hasty. It forces you to buld the smallest cities and the shortest roads possible. But the design of the game is nice and welcoming.

I will play it from time to time but it will never replace the original.

Short term Carcassonne.  The timer on it makes scoring strategy a bit different.  I'm still not sure why I'd buy it if I have the original, though...?  But I guess that's a common sentiment for the endless Carc expansions and remakes.

One play with five. The surveyors are an interesting idea, and they add a more thinky element to the game. At heart, though, it still has that same old Carcassonne feel. Not sure what to think about it yet...playing with five made it very draggy; it might be more enjoyable with fewer players. 

Still, Carcassonne: the Castle is the best version by a long shot (at least of those that I've tried).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Feels a little undercooked. Can tiles extend north and south beyond the line established by the coastline -- in other words, is there a "board edge?" The rules don't say ... Not sure how I feel about the surveyors. They do ratchet up the pace of the game considerably but practically force players into opportunistic vulture moves near the survey line, or quick in-and-outs with abandoned structures left to the east of the line. Fortunately you can throw that stuff out and just play New World as a smallish, self-contained, Thanksgiving-themed version of Carcassonne.

Like the Surveyor mechanic.  Could be played with a standard Carc set, with a couple extra pawns for surveyors.  Otherwise play is almost identical (why original tiles would work).  Art work was muddy/dreary computer generated, and nothing to differentiate similar tiles (like hand art in orginal).  Not a bad game by any means, but I'd much rather pull out Hunters Gatherers or Ark Covenant for better art and play.

As a game itself, it's fantastic, because it's Carcassonne.  But really, it's very little more than a two-meeple expansion for the original Carc with some slightly adjusted rules, and that's how I'm rating it.  The surveyor mechanic is very interesting but hardly worth a new game.  The art on this version is much nicer than that on previous Carc games.

Fun, but not as good as the regular version. The 'westward expansion' mechanic offers some interesting decisions and a very different kind of tension from what you normally get in Carcassonne, but I feel like it takes away more interesting decisions than it gives you. 'Monks' (now 'Farmers' in this version), for instance, are essentially impossible to complete in this game, while the original 'farmers' (now called 'trappers') bring in far fewer points. Also, the graphic design on the tiles is dark and crowded. It's far too easy to mistake a building for an animal or an animal for a building (or to just not notice things altogether).

RATING: 6
Don't know about this game. There seems to be some pretty basic things left out of the rules. Like can you score things even after the surveyor (I'm thinking yes otherwise you'd constantly be starting things and not finishing them) and what happens when the surveyor reaches the currrent westernmost tile (I assume the both sit and wait there until someone adds another tile further to the west and don't move until then even if people continue scoring in the meantime). I think this game might be somewhat more enjoyable after a few plays to become more familiar with it, since it does give a few new and interesting twists over the original Carcassonne.

Is it only me, or do other people find that the trappers end up in big mega-fields with several people scoring the same field? Sort of put a damper on plains building if you were going to benefit another player as much as yourself.

Let me be frank: I hate Carcassonne (even though I said it was a '5'). It's too simplistic for my tastes, plus my gaming group doesn't get it--they got Puerto Rico and Power Grid as their gateway games, but Carcassone was played only once, and now sits on my shelf awaiting a trade. New World is nothing more than a rehash, at a new location, with trappers replacing farmers, and surveyors somehow moving the game along. And yet it doesn't--it is a slow game with 5 people with too much downtime, and very little strategy, and virtually no immersion in the theme, although there is a lot of screw-your-neighbor factor for such a simple game. I got trounced for something like 24 points during the first round, and got lapped in my first and last game of this, so just shoot me. And the box is lying when it says it plays in 30-45 minutes. Our game took 2 painful hours. Yes, I am bitter and livid about my experience, and that is reflected in my ranking.

Another interesting Carcassonne variant.  It takes a few plays to get a feel for the way this one plays as the surveyors really force the pace of the game.  Luck plays a big part of this version, too, as you can score really big if you draw the right tile after a player's meeple has been forced off the board by the movement of the surveyors.

Aug09:

Oh my goodness. This was utter shit.

The rules have tons of gaps. (Can the surveyors go past the tiles? Can you play tiles outside the board? Can you choose the order you score multiple items? Do you move them on completion if nobody gets points?)

They used the "farm" keyword on cloisters.

And the actual play was stupid. We'd build decent sized cities, but the surveyors would boot you off them. Then the next player that drew the cap piece could ninja bounce the whole damn city for tons of points. That's just stupid.

Carcassonne is about investment. Each Meeple is an asset you invest in a feature. You then spend your resources (turns) growing the value of that asset until you cash it out. The surveyors break all of that.

Anyway, horrible.

This resolves two of my issues with Carcassonne (which I still think is an elegant masterpiece): this is more thematic - I feel like I'm exploring the New World, while I never felt like I was building the city of Carcassonne; the Surveyors provide a mechanism for recycling meeples.

I'm not a big Carcassonne fan anyway.  But with the Surveyors, the luck of the tile draws becomes a big factor.  My first play: I had a few plays set up 2 or 3 spaces away from the current location of the Surveyors, but before I could complete them, the Surveyors moved beyond the meeples in play.  I did end up winning, actually, but I'm not particularly interested in playing it again.

I like the looks of this game with the "Pilgrims" and their "Hats". This game is lots of fun for the family. Plays fast too (Less than an hour for the 3 of us), which is a bonus when starting a late night game. We always play with the Surveyors. We like them!

Rating based on playing based on the designer rules -- where you can't score with a meeple on the same turn you play it on.  After a decent number of games with both the "as is" and "designer" rules, we find that we prefer the "designer" rules as the game seems a bit less luck dependent with them and you can plan ahead more.  We usually play with 3 - 5 people (mostly 4).  Hunters and Gatherers is the primary version we play when we play Carcassonne at lunch, so this was a fun change of pace.

Most folks really dont like this game.  I would like to disagree.  After playing for a week, this game with experienced Carc. players is the BEST version there is.  

Rules to  live by:

1. Don't add on to a feature unless you can complete it before the "White Hats" move.  If you do all you do is add to someone elses score.

2. If you cannot get into a good field or complete a feature add your tile to where the White Hats will be.

3.  Try and complete a feature when you are lined up with a White Hat, but dont wait for the perfect move if you do you will be removed.

Our lunchtime group has logged 25+ plays and once we got use to the scoring the winning player only between 2-5 points ahead of everyone else.  

Give it a try you will like it.

This is a tactical, fast-paced dynamic Carcassonne game.

It's fun for family play in part because it is unpredictable and has more chance elements.

Contrary to opinion, it is possible to score farms.  Either by starting one far to the west, or more likely, starting one in a fairly small hole to the east where you need to complete it quickly.

Once your opponents get booted off cities or roads as the surveyors move west, it is possible to go back and reap scores by grabbing their pre-built roads and cities - if you do it fast enough.

I find the most frequent big scores come from small roads and cities where both surveyors are about to be.  The trappers don't score that many points.  Farms are opportunistic.

An interesting twist on Carcassonne.  The addition of the Surveyors adds a nice strategic element to the game, but also breaks the game: Carcassonne is about the luck of the draw, and the beauty of the original game is that it's open plan layout means that bad luck can usually be turned into good, but not so in New World, where the surveyors effectively sweep away parts of the board forcing players to constantly rush ahead. And if one player consistently gets good draws and can score off the Surveyors then they can race ahead leaving all the other players far behind.  Perhaps a house rule where Surveyors do not give bonus is the solution...

Wouldn't choose to play this when I could play Carcassonne instead...

Seven ratings will never be the same again, but I think this game deserves it. It's a nice version of Carc that works well with two. The surveyors add a bit of gambling to the game, which I like. But what is up with the top-hat Meeples? Where're the coonskin caps?

Not as fun as regular Carc. Some interesting new mechanics, like the Surveyors, but not as elegant as the original. I won the game I played and have NEVER won at Carcasonne in my life and probably never will (no spatial reasoning skills). If I can win a spatial game, then I promise, there is something mechanically wrong with the game! While it was great to win, the victory felt a bit hollow (like being the player to roll the most 6's). I would be quite happy not playing this again and sticking to my favorites, Regular Carc and Hs & Gs. On the bright side, the artwork is beautiful; one of the prettiest games I have played!

03/10/09 Played a five-player game, once. I found the game generally fun, but even more dependant on being lucky enough to draw just the right tile.  This changes the Carcassonne experience from what I'd call a 65/35 mix of tactical/strategic, to something like 90/10. So you feel a lot more pressure to complete features, even if its only for 2 or 4 points, than try to build something grandiose. The artwork was generally OK, except the trading posts and the animals were sometimes confused. And the wrong British flag was used on the trading posts and in the cities. There were several rules ambiguities. Its a pleasant change of pace, but I feel the original Carcassonne is better. I think I would rather play New World: A Carcassonne Game in future with less players; maybe three. That way you might have a better chance of completing larger features before your meeples evaporate.
12/22/09 Played a four-player game. The owner says he's yet to see anyone complete a farm, and I believe it. 
01/11/11 Played a four-player game. Finally saw 2-3 farms completed.

Can't rate it yet, because of unresolved rules ambiguities (are you bounded by the 10 wide board, can surveyors wander off the board??).
Playing Yes to both, then so far have had an excellent 2 player experience and a poor 5 player one. (Well Carc is usually rubbish with 5, but we needed a closer after Agricola).

The explorers are a great idea, and actually succeed in what I expect they attempt to do - keeping towns from growing enormous, keeping players concentrated on a smaller area and keeping the game moving - but somehow take away a lot of the fun, ESPECIALLY on four players.

The main problem here... my wife doesn't like tile laying games. That said, I did enjoy this version.. expansion moves inward from the coastline and meeples not yet scored in columns to the west get taken off. It's kinda like a race for the clock thing. This is actually the only Carcassonne game I've played other than The Castle which is only two player, and Carcassonne Online for XBox360. Makes me want to try the other Carcassonnes.

RATING: 6
In this Carcasonne game, players expand from west to east. The twist is that there are two white meeples called surveryors starting on the most western tip of the board. Everytime anyone scores, a surveryor moves east one tile. Any meeple of the same column as a the surveyor scores 4 extra points. Any other meeples to the west of the surveyors are removed, except the trappers, which score like farmers in the original game. 

It adds a neat tactical twist, and is another good gateway game. like the original. There is still lots of luck, though, but easy to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's the seventh stand-alone Carcassonne game in nine years...let that sink in for a moment...and it's the weakest of the ones I've played.  The two surveyors add very little to the formula (even with the designer's preferred method as opposed to the published one), and there seem to be more boring tiles than in other Carc games.  If you have another multi-player Carcassonne game (except maybe The Discovery) and a limited budget, there is simply no reason to buy this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This game has lots of luck in the random tile drafting.  This game creates analysis paralysis as players are trying to plan strategy against a mechanisms that promotes tactics. The rule book has miss prints while the reference sheets contradict.  The benefits are that the worker placement has less luck.

RATING: 6
The worst Carcassonne yet. The surveyors sound like an okay idea at first, but they mostly just steer the game away from long-term planning, and favor instant scoring actions instead.

The rulebook is very ambiguous. Most of all, when combined with the equally ambiguous (and heavily copy-pasted) illustration, it is very unclear on whether the fields actually continue or not in several places. Other holes in the rules include, for example: The rules don't specify at all whether the world ends at the top and bottom rows of the starting coast line (and if it does end there, does that mean that cities and road get completed?), or what to do when there are no tiles for the surveyors to move to. Sounds like the game was rushed in the market without really bothering to blind playtest it.

Edit: The game makes much more sense if you disallow instant scoring moves.

And then there's the infamous naming issue: The Colovini-sonne is called Neues Land in German, while this one is New World in English. Very confusing.

Thanksgiving Carcassonne! The Pilgrims, New World exploration, hunting/trapping, and fall colored trees all remind me of Thanksgiving! Anyway, this is a great new Carc game, that has just enough uniqueness to bring it out when you need a good Carc game...but are in the mood for something a little different! The surveyors are ruthless in denying you your scoring of cities and roads! If they pass your meeples your meeples do not score! But, on the flip side, if they are in your column when you score...then you could get 4 to 8 points more added to your usual score! But still...they are ruthless! The trappers (i.e. farmers in regular Carc) are unafected by the surveyors and claim all the animals in their territory. (Note to self...wife hates it when I steal her animals)!!!

RATING: 7
One of the nicer variants in the Carc world. The tiles and the play are all pretty much the same. Except that there's pressure to score quickly and get your meeples off, induced by the surveyor dudes. These dudes start off on the seaboard edge (from which the tiles get played off) and everytime anyone scores, a surveyor moves one space away from the sea. If ever a meeple falls behind both surveyors, off it comes without scoring. Which leaves opportunities behind (you can play on those unscored abandoned opportunities if you can close it off and score it immediately), making for some randomly big point swings. and encourages people to play on or near the surveyors to gain the big points they offer - if you close something off, get +4 for each surveyor in the same row as your meeple. Then move them on. All of which means a faster game of opportunity hunting and short completions, providing a different feel from the original as this version doesn't contain the setups and competitions for big scoring elements that feature in the original. Worthwhile, but without being a necessary addition.

This is a great variation on regular Carcassonne!  It's fast-paced.  It's tactical.  And has even more take-that.  The game is all about interacting with the 2 surveyor meeples.  You have to stay a head of them, you can't fall behind them, but if you stay side-by-side with them, you can get some nice bonus points.  Don't believe the people who trash this game.  Give it a try.  It's lots of fun!

This game is entertaining just like the other family of Carcassonne games.  The main difference is the movement of one of the two surveyor's after scoring.

After 1 play I don't feel compelled to try it again. Thing is base Carcassonne - with your favourite expansions - is simply a better game. The surveyors mechanic didn't cut it for me and unfortunatelly the rules seem a little forced and not very clever. The race to score as many small features as possible is not fun at all and a lot more prone to unlucky draws than base Carcassonne.

Long story short - stay away! I'm not a die-hard Carcassonne fan, but my wife is and she disliked it as much as I, if not more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
First impressions: Unlike the original Carcassonne, in which the tiles spread out from the center starting tile, play of the tiles in New World (NW) moves relentlessly westward, driven by  surveyor "meeples" who move west every time a player scores a completed road, city or farm.  You only have 5 settler meeples to play, which doesn't seem like enough, but actually is because the meeples on uncompleted features (cities, farms, roads) that are left behind by the westward-moving surveyors are returned to you without scoring, leaving the map rather barren looking.  "Farms" are scored like Cloisters are in Carcassonne.  The spaces that lie between roads, cities, and the map edge (called farms in Carc.) are called "plains" in NW.  Plains can have trappers placed on them (instead of farmers), and one's score for trapping a claim is the number of animals contained in the forests that lie within your claim's borders.  Definitely want to play again.

After one play, I'm not too impressed. The special feature in this Carcassonne variant is intended to give you a new option: finish and score a feature of your own perhaps earlier than you would have otherwise, in order to shut down and render scoreless some features that opponents are working on. But we found that it just constrains where you place your meeples in unpleasant ways. I'd much rather play original Carcassonne.

Bought at a garage sale for $2.  Played it once so far.  If you were just buying one version of Carcassonne, this wouldn't be bad,  it combines some elements of Hunters/Gatherers (simplifies scoring farms....which are called trappers in this game).  It adds two surveyors who are constantly moving west.  They add two elements to the game:  1) a bonus if your meeple scores when a surveyor is on his row, and 2) they return meeples back to the player that are 'unscored' when the surveyors move further west....no meeple is left behind (except for the hunters).

Let me preface my comment by stating I'm a Carcassonne enthusiast: I Enjoy the majority of Carc expansions and spin-offs. My opinion of New World is entirely based on a 5 player experience, And as a 5 player game, New World is a complete failure. 

As I've stared in my comments on standard Carc, I believe it to be optimal at the 3 player level. At 5, the game gets bogged down with too much chaos and way too much down time. New World complicates these flaws even further by adding the surveyors. They can cause all sorts of chaos while you're waiting for your turn. Bad tile draws exaggerate this problem even further. During my game I drew 3 consecutive plain straight road tiles. That left 16 tiles for my opponents to undo my previous work with surveyors and claim it for their own.

Without considering the problematic surveyors, this game neither adds nor refines anything worthwhile in the Carcassonne formula. I see this game as utterly pointless, and a shameless, catan-esque cash in on a popular franchise.

I hope to never see this horrid luck-fest driven game again. My future plays of Carc will be 2-3 players with the standard version + 1 or 2 of these added expansions(inns & cathedrals, traders & builders, abbey and mayor, and the plague). If I'm looking for some variety I'll play Hunters & Gatherers or Ark of the Covenant, both of which are excellent. A game like New World makes me think Carcassonne has reached the end of its expandability life span.

I've always been a fan of Carcassonne, and this one is no exception.  The forced westward march and bonus points from surveyors adds another dimension to the strategy, and a fresh twist on the original.  It's a bit frustrating for new players, and requires a lot of space.  Scoring isn't too bad, and some aspects are easier and more intuitive than the original.  Overall, very enjoyable if you have the time for setup and explanation.

:thumbsup: Contains enough of the Carcassonne-DNA to get started playing quickly (provided you've played Carcassonne before, of course).
:thumbsup: The scoring of fields/farms/meadows is simpler here than in [thing=822][/thing]: just count the animal icons.
:thumbsup: The [i]Surveyors[/i] are an interesting way to put some pressure on completing features and channel the development of the board.

----

:thumbsdown: While beautifully illustrated, the design of the tiles can make it a bit difficult to recognize the animal symbols at times, due to the color palette.

Another stand-alone Carcassonne game, which I really like. It's probably my least favorite so far of the franchise, but that's not a bad thing at all. I still loved it! You are constantly moving west, attempting to stay ahead of the surveyors, who are going to dictate the points you score. It's different, and cool, and Carcassonne. You can't go wrong with this one.

we played it a few times before registering on BGG. It is a nice-looking game, but it is more luck-driven than the basic carcassonne game, so we would always prefer the basic carcassonne instead. (adi)

Why is this game bad?

Well it is just like Carcassonne, which is a great game.  However, instead of being logical, you score or lose your guys in previously built structures when  the advisors move past your row.  This happens when someone else scores.  However, the problem is, this means "Farms" never score, even small cities dont score, and....it was just irritatingly frustrating.

A good variant. Basically, advancing "surveyors" clear out unscored meeples, changing the scoring dynamic. Makes it harder to build up high scoring cities and farms.

  The new surveyors add a sense of urgency to complete you're cites and roads.  Scoring the trappers (aka farmers) is easier now, like in Hunters and Gatherers.  The board builds now in only three directions, making for some tricky play.  Overall my wife and I like it.

Carcassonne with a twist. I originally thought this to be a positive game-changing twist, but I now have my suspicions, as it appears to reward drawing that tile you need at the right time to complete your feature while the surveyors are there (i.e. more luck-based), over shrewd tile-laying to muscle in on your opponent's features.

It does have the prettiest artwork in a Carcassonne game.

A somewhat simple version of Carcassone with only one extra notable mechanic, the surveyors, which force gameplay to move quickly.

I like to play this game instead of Carcassone when I'm after the Carcassone experience without the long gameplay (as I have 5 expansions for Carc, it takes awhile). That said, you could just play base Carcasonne in order to have a "quick game" rather than this game.

It's hard to put my finger on this one.  I thought it was fun, but there is a lot that bothers me as well.  You have to go into it with the mindset that small things are better.  And I recommend not playing it with 5 players, because there's absolutely no way to plan any kind of power move.  By the time it gets to your turn again, the surveyors have likely moved on and you have likely been removed from the board.  I'd like to try it with 3-4 players, though.

RATING: 7
I love this game. However, some of the members in my game group have said they liked the original Carcassonne better with that said, this game seems to be pulled out and played more than the original Carcassonne. I prefer New World to the original Carcassonne.

In this game you have a board that is your score keeper and you build your cities, roads, farms, ect. off of the board to the west. The other difference between this game and the original is the addition of two surveyors. The surveyors give you points if you score in the same colum as they are in. They can also make give up points if either both surveyors move past you or if one surveyor moves while being ahead of you. Another difference is in this game you have trappers and the trappers lay down on the fields known as farms in the original games. They score for each animal shown in the fields you can claim. Also The churches from the original game are now farms.

Those are the only differences in the game as it is pretty much like the original game.

Maybe this is more fun with more than two players, but we found this to be a very frustrating and boring version of Carcassone. I found the art of the cards difficult to parse, and had trouble telling at a glance how many animals were in a plains area, for example, because nothing popped like I would like it to. The surveryors are an interesting mechanic, but in the end it's just not the game for us.

Picked up at a local auction.  We played as straightforward Carcassonne before adding in the surveyors.  Good game but it tends to be long- I just got the big box of carcassonnee and the base game of that plays much quicker.  The kids have got into playing meanly- messing up each other's plans.  Good times.  It is like the base game where they incorporated some of the expansion ideas and then inserted a unique expansion idea (the surveyors).

A great variation on the classic Carcassonne. The surveyors add great pressure to continue moving westward, and provide an incentive to score lots of small features instead of trying to build giant features that lock up your meeples for most of the game - which is good since you only get 5 per player!

The ideal audience for this game is the people who have played Carcassonne to the point of knowing it extremely well -- hey, that's me!  I found this an excellent new dimension in Carcassonne, adding a sort of built-in ticker.  Most of the usual scoring takes place in advance of a gradually moving frontier line.  Carcassonne with moving deadlines.  Very nice design for the old hands.

Nice and quite smooth clone of original [gameid=822]. It has some neat twists, but it is not impressive enough to force me to swap original one for this. Yet, it could be a neat gift for someone, who has no copy of any variants of this perfect game family.

RATING: 6.5
[RGG 2008 Edition] {Carcassonne; tile-laying; optimal 2p} Basically the same Carcassonne.  In this game, players have to race to the west to avoid meeples being removed from the game. Player interaction is good but it can be quite chaotic with more players.

The illustration is so so - I prefer lighter color.

RATING: 7
Just some initial impressions of the game.  The art work for the tiles is really beautiful and attractive.

The scoring board feels as if it is overlarge and could have had more "point" spots on it....at lest some 50/100 tiles or indicators would help.

Though the meeple figures are sort of nice, it seems like it would have been nice to have these look more like covered wagons (though I realize that might seem confusing to the trapper function) thematically anyway.

I enjoy this one more than basic carc. We play an added rule of keeping within the starting tile boundary, and this makes for a closer game. No big city scoring farmers which I've never really got the hang of makes this the carc of choice for me.

Single 3-player game. Carc with a ticking clock which removes as-yet-unscored meeples from the board.

As regular Carcassonne was getting a tad stale (especially with all the expansions) but we like the mechanic I picked this up. We played it with a group of 5 and it was pretty intense; the surveyor really ratchets up the pressure. Bit humorous trying to use the new names and roles and not use the classic version names and roles ("No, it's NOT farm, it's trapping...farming is like the cloister now...") 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
A perfectly reasonable Carc game with a race/risk element, but it is just not as pretty or as fun as original Carc, so why bother?

Update: Playing it again after a long time this really felt as though it had removed all of the interesting aspects from Carcassonne. There's no now real opportunity to battle over control of cities or build large scoring features at the risk of the game ending and only scoring half. All of this is taken away and what is added in is a meaningless luck fest of scoring other people's abandoned features. It was so bad we ended up checking through the rule book expecting to find we'd been playing it incorrectly. 

I'm willing to try it again someday to see if it grows on me, but I have very low hopes for it.

Rating down from 6.8 to 3.5.

Received as a gift. Finally got it to the table.

I think it has some interesting strengths compared to the basic game, and some weaknesses, though these are related.

First, the forced westward expansion was interesting.  It created an nice dynamic.

But...the surveyors outpaced the players' meeples on the board.  It became laughable, since your figures would be out and picked up before they could do anything.

As the basic rules stand, I don't like it quite as much as the basic game.  With a slight tweak of the surveyors, I could enjoy it more than the basic game.

New World Same Old Shit. Very disappointing as they wring the life out of Carc expansions and derivitives. Surveyor mechanics felt very forced and artificial - as well as making little logical sense, and enabled me to joint win by stealing someone else's big city that they had been evicted from for me to glide in and finish it off - urgh! Too random and too prone to fortune. Not keen at all.

RATING: 4
This isn't horrible, but the theme doesn't really work and the major new mechanic - the movement of the surveyors forcing players to score quickly or have their meeple settlers fall behind and be swept from the board - just isn't all that compelling. This certainly isn't an improvement over the any of the other dozen Carcassonne variants out there, and isn't as good as most of them ...

Was promising to start with, but after a few rounds one realise that it just is plain old Carcassonne, but only half the fun. Though with house rules this one could shine (no building north or south of the starting tile, no "holes" allowed if you can help it, &c).

Another Carcassonne spinoff that, like Discovery, just didn't quite do it for me.  Luck is ratcheted up a notch, as is frustration, as you need to draw the right tiles before the surveyors eliminate your meeples from the board.  Then a later lucky draw by another player lets them score the feature you just got kicked off.  I don't play the basic game so much that I really need a change of pace (and own and enjoy Hunters & Gatherers if I ever do), so I don't really see the point of this game for me.  True Carcassonne enthusiasts may see things differently, but I'd always choose to play the base game, possibly with an expansion or two.

In this Carcassonne game, players begin as the early settlers of the United States did on the east coast of America. As they explore westward, they build towns, farms, roads, and compete to score more points than the others players.

The first half of the game is quite nice and feels innovative enough, with nice decisions about wether to put settlers near the frontier or not.
After the two explorers reach the a certain point, this game becomes just a luck fest where you try to find a tile that alone completes a road or city or farm back toward east. No good.

Rating for play with the rules as they come in the box. 

There are online rules that state followers don't get removed on scoring if both surviors are on the westmost tile, which i assuem will improve the game a bti. 
And there is a rule the designer intended (you can't place a meeple on a feature you're finishing with the current tile) that could greatly change the gameplay (not tested yet).

Played it few times with my wife. Both with standard Carcassonne and actual Mayflower rules. It is fun either way. 

New world rules add some additional decision to the game - i.e. do you score short road moving the explorers further west, risking your other "investments"? Also you will never have your meeples stuck waiting for this one and only tile that will let you close a city. They just return back to your hand when explorer move away from them (scoring nothing).  

On the other hand since you are pressed to move west at the end the created landscape is not as nice as with the standard rules. There are lots of holes in the map. And by the way you need a quite a long table :).

Received it as a prize in a contest held by one of the Polish on-line board game shops (rebel.pl - sorry for the small advertisement but I am really happy and I think they deserve mentioning.)

Carcassonne with a bite.  This version is very vicious and seems to encourage quick scorings rather than having your meeple sit on the board for a long time as you build your asset up.  The farms as well as the act of contesting for towns/roads feels pointless because more often than not your guys will get removed before you can complete them.  The surveyors are a pain for sure but they do appear to have an effect of hurrying the game along (since the original has a tendency to drag on every turn).  Long term planning is possible but really has more to do with luck more than anything else.

It's an ok variant and does breathe some life back into the series.  Not something I feel compelled to have however.

Reading the rules, I was dismayed by how similar it was to stock [gameid=822]; however, play proved that the subtle changes were quite nice.  It's [gameid=822] with a sense of urgency provided by the surveyors.  Additionally, they provide greater opportunities for gambling, while helping new players get their ill-placed meeples back.  That is, unless they've turned them all into trappers....
If you already have another [family=2]Carcassonne family[/family] base game (except [thing=12902]The City[/thing] or [thing=7717]The Castle[/thing], since they're bound by walls), you can adopt the surveyor rules and have no need to purchase this.  Otherwise, this would make a fine starting point - especially if you want to avoid the expansionitis of [gameid=822].

After 1 Game: I really did not like this game.  The deficiencies of the rules seem so obvious, I just don't understand how it was published in this condition.  When meeples are kicked off features, big scoring opportunities are left to reward lucky tile draws.

Up to this point I was collecting everything Carcassonne, and that stopped with this game.  I guess I should be thankful, since if this was just crummy instead of awful I'd probably still be buying Carc stuff instead of trading it off.

A remarkably bad rethinking of Carcassone. None of the new mechanics make the game more fun. One could argue that they offer variety, but it's pointless variety.

Not really an improvement, just different. Also makes some pieces very hard to play (especially the 'monasteries')

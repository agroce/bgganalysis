It has a LOT of rules, but the semi-cooperative game plays at a decent pace.  As with many cooperative games, when you're losing, there's no real way to make it up...and if the game's long, you may have a crummy last hour.  I like the combat mechanism.  One of those game that will get better the more you play it, but unless I play it again soon, it will take another 30 minutes to re-learn the rules.

RATING: 8
As others have commented, Mousquetaires feels like a combination of Shadows Over Camelot's multiple, simultaneous quests with Lord of the Rings' linear approach.  It's to the designers' credit that Mousquetaires avoids the former's gamey Rummy-style set collection and the latter's scripted feel.  Added to that, Mousquetaires is both nicely thematic and a challenging game, even in its fully cooperative incarnation.

Production quality is decent, except for possibly the worst ever box insert - the board won't lie flat on it. Artwork is kind of children's story book style, but all quite functional.  The rules are horrible.  As with Confucius one wonders how explaining what's only a moderately complex game can be quite so tortuous.

1 vs others: 3 player easier for Musketeers. 5&4 player easier for Milady. 2 player seems pretty balanced.
Dice are sometimes frustrating, but anyway, being Milady is fun.

I knew this was not going to be my type of game, but decided to tough it out as until now I have been a big fan of Cyril Demaegd and Ystari.  I'm not keen on co-operative games.  They seem fairly pointless to me, with the more experienced or 'loud' players taking over and playing solo.  The rule book to this game was giving the 3 experienced players using it a lot of difficulty.  This was the owner's second attempt to get the game off the ground.  My impression was of Knizia's LotR with added complications.  Arnaud Demaegd's graphics were up to their usual high standard.  

Three of the five players enjoyed enormously.  Two, including me, did not.  Our game took four hours.  The Lady thankfully finally putting me out of my misery.  Probably the worst game experience I can recall for a long tome (since 'After the Flood' - but for very different reasons).  There is probably a reasonable game here, just not my type, hence the rating.

RATING: 7.5
A good fun coop/semi-coop in the mould of /Shadows over Camelot/; manages to be quite thematic and well tied-together between the duels and plots and so on despite the relatively simple and repetitive nature of the mechanics.

Let down seriously by the awful graphic design (albeit with fairly nice illustrations) and pretty bad rulebook layout, but these are definitely worth struggling through.

(Have only played the pure co-op variant so far, but I'm looking forward to trying the one-vs-many option.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I have a suspicion over time my score will suffer like other co-ops like Pandemic/Shadows over Camelot/Lord of the Rings from bossy experienced players, passive new players, and a repeat of mechanics and dialogue. However, my first play of the game was everything I wanted from a co-op that was missing from the previous listed ones.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.25
An incredibly fun and difficult co-op in the 3 Musketeer universe. I would ALWAYS recommend playing this as a full co-op and without the Milady player. Just be prepared, this is one of the worst rulebooks you will ever see. It is atrociously bad. Print out some files here on BGG to walk you through the process. The gameplay is actually very simple (go to Locations, roll some dice, move some tokens around) despite the rules. Not many great lighter games with this theme, so this gets a high recommendation from me!

Great co-op game. It is actually more balanced than it more seemed to be.
If you play against very good mylady, then even the best musketeers seemingly cannot win.
But medium my lady and great musketeers are best way to play the game.

Based on one play, I would say this game is a little too complicated with resources and upgrades which leads to long discussions about maximizing every turn.  This sucks the theme and adventure out of the game and makes the game drag.  Thematically, I was also a little disappointed that the Musketeers were such pussies.

The little gotchas and rule nuances that aren't clear in the rule book can be a pain and it's hard to enjoy without at least three, although five is preferred. Thematically rich, the artwork and fantastic, but too much dice rolling and luck. Set up was terrible and annoyed me every time. Traded it away, couldn't get anyone to play with me, and quite frankly the dice rolling and set up put me off anyway. Really wanted to love this game.

Quick gameplay once players have grasped the rules. The game parallels the book very closely though the main mechanic is similar to Lord of the Rings or Shadows Over Camelot in having to push tokens along tracks to progress the storyline or be defeated. I'm not that taken with that aspect because it can feel totally abstract at times though I did like the dice sword-fighting mechanic [shields block swords, excess swords cause wounds, if no result both lose a die and fight again and the special fencing move dice combination that results in an instant win]. 

Co-operative play is an obvious choice for the Musketeers theme and it works fairly well in this game though it does mean that one player can annoyingly dominate the decision making which to me is a big turn-off. The artwork and minis are all well done. Strangely, the game also includes a sixth player board (Captain of the Musketeers) but not his mini which must be bought separately! Either he's part of the game or he isn't. Make up your minds!

Can be played as a pure co op or one player playing Milady (the adversary.) rule book was tough to figure out. The rule book rewrite in the files section is absolute.
Decent game once the rules are learned.
Too many rules to remember, too many exceptions. When I think about playing again I do not want to spend time to relearn the game from the horrible rule book. I want to play a game that flows with easy to remember rules.

Half a game with the kids in the hour before bedtime. I bought it because of their love for the Dogtanian series and it didn't disappoint. We semi-coopted it with me as Treville & Milady while they each took two musketeers. lots of theme. From the story & lots of fun with the duelling.

Musketeer players try to card 'n' dice their way through a series of quest boards while putting out fires on various tracks that Milady is trying to card 'n' dice her way through first. There's a lot going on, but no one area is particularly complex. It is all very colorful and flavorful, as these games go.

The game seems to be very brittle -- our first try began with a card in play where Milady has to roll six 50/50 successes, rolling 4 dice per turn, to immediately win the game. To get rid of it, the Muskies have to defeat a vile minion in combat and complete a challenge that involves drawing a few of a specific card. Well, the minion was defeated, but the required cards were not drawn in the two turns that it took Milady to complete her mission (6 50/50 successes on 8 rolls is friendly dice but not outrageous).

Basically, it seems like a few bad rolls or draws can pretty much doom the Musketeers in this game -- Milady has about a half-dozen ways to win, including hitting a turn limit, that they have to worry about in addition to completing their win condition. Worth another look, but I'm wondering if the full co-op version of the game might be the way to go.

Finely themed game that ultimately resolves (and often) into a dice fest that is weighted against the heroes.  The game makes up for this by making the middle rounds incredibly easy.  Blegh.

Based on the Three Musketeers novel, this is a game where you are adventuring at different locations in and around Paris, France as either the Musketeers or Milady de Winter. You complete missions at the Louvre or on the Quest for the Queen's Diamonds while protecting your interests at the Bastille and dealing with distractions from Milady in Paris like her arrangement for the kidnapping of Constance (D'Artagnan's girlfriend).

The game has great components especially the dice(!) and is super simple to play, but the rules are absolutely atrocious!!! Thanks to the re-write by Wade Nelson in the Files section we were finally able to figure out how to play which was much more straightforward than the rules made it seem. As 2 players, one player has to control all four Musketeers while the other player is Milady. It works, but it's not ideal. It's definitely more fun to play as the Musketeers than Milady, and definitely a better game for multiple players rather than just 2. This is most obvious while playing the co-op mode which really needs a thinking player rather than an AI to control Milady's actions. We've only played it co-op once though so we might have just been lucky!

Picked up cheap in the works 2014. I might even play it at some point :P


The rulebook here is truly truly awful, still we persisted and after about an hour of putting our heads together, banding ideas around and other general discussion we think we  worked out how it plays. So we set to and played a game, we played the fully co-op version whereby you shuffled the milady cards and play against the game, and actually it was surprisingly good fun.

We all went into the game with the preconception that we were going to trade it away immediately however both T and I have changed our minds. I like a good co-op and this one doesn't dissappoint, there is plenty to do on your turn and the different tracks are sufficiently tight that you simply do not have time to dawdle through the game you actually have  race to England and get those jewels back before Richeleau enacts the final parts of his plan and the queens reputation is ruined .

We immediately played a second game and were all giggling like school girls at just how badly everything was falling apart. Good co-op fun with an awesome theme:)

Feels like Shadows Over Camelot a bit, but not as well balanced.  Seems whoever is in control of M'Lady has the odds slanted well in her favor.

It's also a long play.  Not my favorite.  I will stick with Shadows, Defenders, and Pandemic for cooperative play.

Fun cooperative game, theme comes across well, tension builds nicely, I prefer it to Shadows over Camelot, though it has a similar feel in the way that there are different areas of the Board to attack/defend.  Not straightforward to learn or teach, but once you've played it starts to come together.

Not much in common with the previous games of ystari (except from a worse than ever graphic design), this is a very entertaining and thematic semi coop (one player is the vilainous side).
I like this game more and more.

This game is really inventive, the theme is nice and very present, and there are incentives to be brash (which counteracts the tendancy in coops or team vs one to have one player deciding for all the others).  It is totally different from anything I've tried so far, and runs (as usual for games developped by Ystari) like a swiss clock.

As for the game - this is very decent coop/semi-coop.  

What's important - the game seems balanced and the fight for win lasts until the final turn...

Very good for solo play too.

EDIT: I've seen and played enough.
And the lengthy (and full of nuances) rules don't help either.  It's not a pleasant experience to explain the game to newbies and supervise the play afterwards...

RATING: 7
While it has some problems (almost 100% related to poor rulebook translation), it's an interesting take on the coop genre.  It really solves almost all of the problems that a pure coop has but the inclusion of a Human Intelligence rather than a random puzzle - and it works.  The theme is underused and a classic of adventure.  In addition, the dice are priceless for keeping the tension high and making the game not too samey.  I think there may be a power imbalance towards Milady but more plays will figure that out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A co-op that promises to take 60-90 minutes once the players know the rules. It is apparently best with 2, 3, or 5 - since there are four musketeers the fix for the 4p game is a bit kludgy. Or so I'm told, but I believe it. It is all vs. one, as one player plays Milady de Winter who is plotting to dishonor the queen of France. If she succeeds in this or any other of her other major objectives before the musketeers retrieve the royal diamonds from the queen's lover in London, the forces of Cardinal Richelieu win.

Milady is definitely favored with inexperienced players - I hope this turns out to be an analogue to BSG where the Cylons win the early games until the human players figure out what they're doing.

Solid 7 - potential to rise to 8 but more likely will hold at 7.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
One solo play to get the rules right and one 5p face to face

Tense and fun co-operative game with one player as Milady taking on all the others as Musketeers, who have to co-ordinate well to stand a chance against Milady. 

The Musketeers have more to do (Milady's turns don't take very long) but players of a sadistic nature should enjoy laying traps and ambushes and generally making a pest of themselves as Milady - much like the source inspiration in the book!

One of the most thematic games I've played - excellent evocation of the book and films.

Similar to Fury of Dracula in pitting one (Milady) against a team of four (the Mousquetaires). It's also a main course easily filling the better part of a game night. The planning parts are more Euro while the dice duels inject a heavy dose of Ameritrash. Only having played once as Milady I'm surprised how lean her part is in this game. Each turn, she only has a few small decisions to take while 90% of the game is the Mousquetaire action part with occasional interaction with Milady in the battles. Playing the Mousquetaires is the more interesting part although this part is prone to cooperative bossing. I like the game, I'm just not sure if there's a need to keep it when the same spot can be filled with Fury of Dracula. It doesn't help that the rules are among the hardest to grok for a medium-weight game. Better have a player around that has played before.

Okay I have had this game 7 years now and played it twice in the first year, My first play was with a friend who read the rules because I did not understand a blasted word as they were so badly written that they made no sense. My second play was solo to embed the rules in my brain however after a couple of hours of trying to remind myself of bits from the incomprehensible rules I put it away never to play again. I have seen good games destroyed by  lack of thought in the design process - not sure of how good a game this is yet but it has certainly been severely damaged by whoever designed, assembled and proof read the rules and I have thought twice (no thrice) before buying any Ystari game since which had up until then been auto-buys at Essen.

RATING: 8
Very favorable impressions after first play.  Theme is very well integrated.  Game mechanics create a strong sense of desperation for the musketeer players as they scramble to put out fires across the board.  Game provides many choices and the use of a human adversary for the cooperating players solves the complaint lodged by many about other cooperative games, such as Pandemic, namely, that one player can dominate the coopeartive group, telling everyone else what to do.  In this game, this sort of domination is constrained by the fact that conversations among the musketeers are heard by their human opponent, who will then have advance notice of their plans.  As a result, each musketeer must largely operate on his own, observing the actions of his playing partners, and adatpting his own strategy to complement their actions.

I like playing Milady, and I usually win. :) It is surprisingly easy for the musketeers to forget that, although they can lose the game in several side quests, they can only win in the main one.

Played 10-15 times. Playing against a human Milady player seems very hard for the good guys, what with Rochefort and everything. Playing as Milady was kind of interesting, but not much to do while the 4 good guys were doing there stuff, except rolling a few dice. I rate it a 7 for playing competetively and an 8 for fully co-operative. Once you have read the FAQ, that is. I like the artwork and the game is less repetitive than some other co-ops, like Yggdrasil.

The rulebook is bad, and there are a lot of small nuances you need to work out. There really should have been a sheet just for playing the game without a mylady-player. More details about the various cards would have helped. Also, I think there should have been more background stories for the cards. A missed opportunity.

RATING: 7
Yet another game that fired Shadows over Camelot. While its known who the Milady player is, what he might be up to is not. The graphic design is blech, the rule book is questionable, but there is something in here worth digging down to. Its not easy to teach or learn, and the heroes on the first play are not likely to manage their resources correctly, or realize they need to minimize the chance of dice rolls. The game is tough and unforgiving in that regard in the favor of Milady, but there lies the challenge.

A surprising hit, despite the negative comments from some at BGG Con 2010. The rules are atrocious, but the game is a nice team-vs-team affair with a good feel for the theme of the Musketeers.

One against many. It's pseudo Ameritrash (most progress is achieved via dice combats) with a Euro theme. The Musketeers are trying to fight their way through 4 different quest boards, with the fights mainly being dice competitions and card set melds. Sauron keeps distracting them away though, because he has 4 different ways to win at locations other than the quest, and those distractions need to be managed (more dice competitions and card set melds) and maintained at reasonable levels. Winning these fights gives money, money allows the team to buy equipment which makes future fights and quests easier to win. How to spread this money amongst the team engenders good debate. Even more so does the continual question of what to manage next and who best to do it. And that's the charm of the game. There are many ways to approach the issues and there's continual engagement from all players. Sauron has less to do and fewer real decisions to make, mainly being to put out characters to fight, rolling the dice for them, choosing the traps and challenges that maximises the pressure on the Musketeers, which can make for a fairly dull old time. There isn't the secrecy tension that Shadows or Galactica offer, but it provides much more collective cheering and groaning as fates rise and ebb throughout. The rules aren't great and there's some chrome you'll need to master, but there's some fun to be had if you can invest the time.

RATING: 7
"As a pure co-op, it has more different areas to work on than most. Interesting mix of hand management, role powers, and dice combat. Bummer that you can't play with just 2 musketeers."

What I like:
- Main quest plus 3 ongoing distractions
- The main quest has 4 very different phases
- Several "lose instantly" threats
- AI for solo/co-op is pretty straightforward and effective
- Decent miniatures, and nice custom dice

What I don't like:
- Requires 3 or 4 musketeers in every game
- A bit tricky to learn and teach
- Gender roles inherited from the old literature
- 1-vs-many mode is probably better, if you like that sort of thing

Where most co-ops have one thing you "must do" to win, and one other thing you have to keep under control (a fire, or some diseases), this one has you fighting on 4 fronts simultaneously. If you don't invest in the war, you can lose immediately. If you don't keep the queen's honor intact at the Louvre, you can lose immediately. Unresolved affairs in Paris have catastrophic effects in other areas. But you have to complete the quest to retrieve the jewels within a set number of rounds in order to win. 

As a result, the tension doesn't come from a threat that grows bigger and bigger. Nor does it come from swarms of enemies coming at you. It's more of a constant, multi-headed pressure. Which is a nice change. 

I would put the weight around 3.0, as all the different facets of the game each have their own rules. However, once you learn it, it plays quite smoothly.

Too abstract to be a thematic game: first main quest is to defeat four chips on a track - how thematic is that? And the flow-chart like board design and use in game is also like it is taken from some abstract euro, except even less theme is left there. Not much tension as decisions are quite straight forward or matter little - everything is resolved by dice rolls anyway (strongly in Miladys favour).

An excellent game, and very well balanced.  Players must keep their eyes on the 4 ways Milady can win and the one way the Musketeers can win.

A lot of rules to get to grips with, and there is a 5-page FAQ (see Files section above).  But after a few turns, the game moves along nicely.

On our second 3-player game, the play was very close.  It ended with a win for Milady on the very last possible turn with a Treachery card play advancing the time track.  Otherwise the Musketeers were poised to win with them only having the last part of the last Quest board to complete.

As suggested in the rules, do not play with the sand-timer cards before players are very familiar with the game.

Bah. Just an old generation, bland coop. If you like musketeers, you will probably enjoy it, otherwise, it looks very uninspiring and the graphics are simply ugly. 

The board is huge, where in reality it could be like 1/4 of the size. All you do is wonder between 3 locations and roll the dice. Push some luck, get screwed by rolls (or not) anyway. Looks like there's always just one strategy to follow. 

Wouldn't play again.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The overall appearance may be deceiving in this one. Behind the the Ystari look and Musketeer theme there is actually a very enjoyable, engaging and challenging co-operative game. The term "co-operation" is redefined in this game. The musketeers truly have to work together to last bit of detail or they'll miserably lose the game. Luck is a factor for creating interesting results(I just love the combat in this game. The system is just pure fun.) but the musketeers have to carefully plan their fights and not just rush in every place like a fool. Determining Milady's location is another thing, so there is also a bit of mind-games and deduction element in the game. Milady's role may seem too simple at first but you can play turns badly if you don't realize the long term effects and think about the musketeers' next actions. The timing of cards and enemies is another crucial factor. The powerful cards may be devastating when played at right moment but really weak when the musketeers can counter them. The learning curve is not definitely short in this game, so you'll have to get a few games under your belt until you learn some of the different strategies. Overall all the game elements create a very smooth and fast paced experiment that is truly enjoyable and fun for both the musketeers and Milady. One of the best semi co-op games in the market.

This is a Mr X game, with one player (M'Lady) against a team. Like all Mr X games the immediate question is how does this differ from a two player game, as more experienced players will largely dictate the moves of less experienced. It has the same basic - multiple countdowns to defeat against a quest that needs completing to win that exists in Battlestar Galactica and Shadows over Camelot, but many of elements are too fiddly, too random, and too dull. Overall not a particularly good game.

Basically Shadows over Camelot without the traitor aspect, which makes for a boring game.

This is a very fun narrative game in the tradition of Shadows Over Camelot or Lord of the Rings, though it is more "American" in its design than either of those. It does a great job recreating those moments of dramatic tension from the novel, and it ends up being a terrific experience, much better than I expected it to be.

Part of that expectation comes from the rules, which are an absolute travesty. I highly recommend one of the updated rulesets in the files section, as that will explain the game far better than what is in the box.

"One against all, all against one."

For a cooperative game (for all but one player), this certainly generates more discussion than usual between musketeers. Ultimately it's a letdown for me because I dislike the compromises and different strategies between teammates who need to select one collective path. Without wanting to stamp my foot down I find myself at the whim of teammates with different ideas of how to progress than I. Quite frankly I want to do my own thing and try my own ideas, but instead in an effort to be polite I find myself someone's bitch. So what's the point? I don't want to convince other players that my ideas are better. Isn't that what I could do in a game where I am alone responsible for my actions?

If you like cooperative games then this provides a much better challenge than most of the others in this genre. The theme is nice if you're a fan. The bits and artwork is nice. It certainly generates discussion between players, so it's a very interactive affair. Bad dice rolls can really affect your plans, but that's part of the fun, right? Me? Like with all cooperatives I'd prefer to play a game I can control my own decisions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
(First game rating.)  Excellent two faction game which is properly unbalanced and brutally unforgiving if you don't understand the resource management properly.  It's what the Lord of the Rings: Sauron game ought to have been like.  
The dice-rolling was frustrating but again that was largely because as first-time players we didn't understand how it was intended to work (the Musketeers have inferior dice to the enemies, so they need to expend cards) - having said that, I am worried that having bad rolls at La Rochelle might produce a bad taste since there are no ways around that.
I look forward to playing this again - I suspect that my rating will trend upwards.

Great thematic adventure.  Perfectly captures the story.  The came plays much like most modern cooperatives with building threats working as sandtimers compelling the defenders to contantly juggle their actions and resources.  While the challenges are often abstract it seems more natural here than gamey chuff like saving the world through rummy in shadows over Camelot.

It should be said there is a huge rules overhead to this.  Expect the game to be twice or three times as long as it should be the first game.

A turn begins with Milady playing plots/cards, and program secretely a destination.

Then, each musketeer (D'artagnan, Portos, Aramis or Athos) has 3/4 actions to perform amongst: move, draw a card, get equipments, exchange cards/equipments, do a challenge in one of his 4 characteristics, perform a fight against one of Richelieu's guards, reinforce La Rochelle... Milady can reveal herself and send Rochefort to fight the Musketeers.

Another bargain from The Works. Surprising depth for a seemingly simple game. Has a feel of a Euro-Trash - basically worker placement but with an interesting set of mechanisms reminiscent of Elder Sign with a bit of combat thrown in. Really enjoyable first game, feels like it should have good replayability but there seem to be a limited number of 'mini-quest' cards but it remains to be seen how tiring they get and how quickly. You could always design a few more for flavour though. Nice thinky game that requires keeping a lot of plates spinning for the Musketeers

Provisional rating, one play, as Milady. None of us had played the game before, but I'd read the rules so I taught - and that took a long time.  Once we got going the turns seemed to go quite quickly.

The Musketeers lost quickly in la Rochelle, and afterwards commented that the game was unbalanced. My feeling is that they focussed too much on their objective and not enough on countering mine. 

I like teamwork games so I'd rather have been a Musketeer myself, but their play is largely open while Milady has secrets to keep, so it made more sense to be her. I'm look forward to the time when I'm not the teacher.

French designed co-op with lovely unique look and feel. pleased to get this at the Works sale. Has bags of character and a similarly bonkers play system.

Played once, waiting for more (3pl, no Milady).

Played twice - 1:1, I was Milady, it was great game (for me), won in last round. Up from 7.3.

The game has a sly ambiance.  The illustrations are top-notch, and there's a solid dose of context, background, and storyline crammed into this literary adaptation.

But nowadays, given the current glut of coop and semi-coop games, a new entry in the genre must be truly exceptional to find a spot in my collection.  Mousquetaires doesn't meet the "must own" threshold for me, and I'm barely convinced that I'd want to play it more than 2-3 more times - especially since the Milady player doesn't have much to do.  The all-for-one, one-for all attitude can't carry the day when the Evil One is bored out of her mind.

Darn the rulebook sucks... Still, it's worth to play the game. Really enjoyed it eventually :)

Takes a bit of time to get through all the rules, but this is a good semi-cooperative game.  Very different from other games and overlooked.  Probably more fun to play the musketeers than Milady.

It's a collaborative game that is built seemingly pretty well upon a classic story that doesn't interest me.  That's two steps back before I even start the game.  Nonetheless, it seems like it should appeal to fans of collaborative games (or one-against-all games, such as [thing=3819][/thing]), and it should appeal to musketeers fans.

Reminds me of Knizia's LotR co-op. The rulebook is a nightmare, and there are a lot of tiny rules. But once you get over these initial hurdles it's quite a colourful game.

My first play was in Essen and we didn't immediately catch the bluff part of the game. 
After several games, you start to think after every token that is placed on the board: is it bluff or not ? I think that he thinks that I think that he's bluffing then ....

I really enjoy this game. Congrats to the designer.

I love deduction games, so I was a bit disappointed as I didn’t find Lady Alice exciting, but at least I saved a bit of money as I don’t want to buy it now. We even played with 4 which, by reading the rules for 3 and 5 players, is probably the only way to play it! The reason I didn’t enjoyed Lady Alice was probably the fact that you have to memorize a lot of things as you cannot write down what you know. Yes, the game wouldn’t work well if you could write down everything, but personally I didn’t like that players with better memory had an advantage before the game even began. This might actually make the 3 player game better as you don't need to deduct as much as in the 4p game. I need to try that.

I did like the fact that there is a huge bluffing and double-bluffing aspect! With 4 friends who know each other well, this game has the potential to shine. While I would probably not refuse to play Lady Alice once or twice more, I wouldn’t mind if I never got to play it again, so it’s definitely not a game I would suggest playing.

Clue killer. All the best parts of that game and no roll and move. Adds on a neat little point bidding mechanism that kind of sort of feels tacked on, but it makes sense in terms of keeping players on equal footing. Plays quick, rather fun. A winner in my book.

Players are Sherlock Holmes' street urchins, learning from the master by practising to solve a case.  Cluedo-esque game where players are trying to determine the four aspects to the solution of a case, where each player knows one private clue.  A case is setup in a neat flip book, and players must reveal a happy/grumpy Holmes based on whether they are holding one of the aspects of the case.  Based on information, players take turns placing blind bidding chips on the board against what they think the correct solution is - but some of these chips are bluffs, and others have values that are victory points if correctly positioned.  Bonus points awarded at the end for a correct accusation, and consistency too.  

Very nice bluff/deduction game, plays quickly, looks nice, and feels a little different from other deduction games.  I liked it.

2013-06-03 After two plays, both effected by players making mistakes in the confirmation of deductions phase, Im really Meh! My 11 year old loved both games even though they resulted in a meaningless mess. I am happy to play again, but I am already thinking that a deduction game this is not!

2013-10-20 When you play it right, it's quite a good little game, doesn't overstay its welcome, though is a bit fiddly for my tastes. Oh! and this is most definitely a bluffing game masquerading as a deduction game.

RATING: 9
This is a really brilliant deduction game. It plays like the best aspects of clue, but with the addition of a bluffing and betting mechanic and the removal of having to move around a board. 

The entire instruction manual is amazingly well written in the voice of Sherlock Holmes himself, teaching the Baker Street kids how to properly deduce and bluff their way through a mystery. All of the pieces are extremely high quality, and for the most part the entire game is well designed.

The only real faults that the game has is that it requires a group that is completely trustworthy, because having a player give incorrect information during the suspicion phase can easily ruin a game.

There are a few flaws in the basic design though, that I hope the publisher fixes in later versions:

1) The suspicion and accusation phases are played with little portfolios that you slide a double sided card into. It's very easy to accidentally have a card slide out of it's sleeve, even just partially, and prematurely reveal a result. You have to be really careful with them or you'll end up making everyone redo  that portion.  The game would have been better with a pair of cards with identical backs, similar to Resistance/Avalon.

2) There are two people in the game that look way too close to one another. They both have a very obvious full beard and mustache, and that alone has caused confusion in a few of our games. I wish one of those two characters was removed, and replaced with someone a bit more unique.   The characters' names are different enough, but it's too easy to see a card at a glance and not realize you screwed up until it's too late.

It's one of these game were winning becomes a secondary objective, its very fun to watch other players trying to take the right guess, sometimes going completely in the wrong direction.  We play it a lot with three players which is definitely not optimal, so maybe we should try it next time with 4 players.

RATING: 6
A deduction game that is fairly short and easy. Great production, and the game is simple enough that it doesn't require any note-taking. A neat spiral notebook is used to make your guesses.

One flaw of the game has to do with some of the nice components. Players have one double-sided card used reveal their knowledge. It is slipped into a sleeve and shuffled. In the copy we played, two of the sleeves had come unglued, making them identifiable. It seems like a less fancy production with two cards with the same back (like in The Resistance) would have been a better solution.

Would happily play this one again.

Lady Alice suffers from bad components. The quality of the components is fine; the choice of components is poor. Players put their double-sided "Correct/Incorrect" card secretly into a sleeve. This would be much better if players simply had two different cards. Since the cards are double-sided, players have to turn their backs and secretly put the cards into sleeves. Plus, the cards can slip out of the sleeves, revealing ever so slightly, if a player played a "Correct" or "Incorrect". Furthermore, the sleeves in question came wrapped in rubberbands! This means the sleeves are actually marked! And you can tell who played what card. This is unacceptable in a deduction/bluffing game.

The counters players use for bidding are smaller than pennies. They are very difficult to pick up and move. And since players are using these to bluff ("Did he play a two or a zero?"), this is also unacceptable.

Interesting combination between deduction and bluffing. A good poker player with poor memory would probably be as successful as a player with perfect memory but poor intuition/poker skills in this game that plays best with 4. A refreshing spin on the traditional cluedo style game. There is a bit of an issue with the clue giving stage of the game where yes and no's are placed in an envelope. Unless players are careful the colour of the card can show at the margin giving the clues away.Putting some black tape over the envelope slot helps fix this issue. Overall a great game with good components and a tense feel.

If you are expecting a meaty deduction game keep looking.  This game is light and fairly quick. The bluffing is the best part. After two games it seemed rather simplistic and became stale rather quick, you chose a combination from the book everyone says yes or no you bet . . . rinse and repeat.  Might work better with children.

While I originally thought this was a deduction game, the majority of gameplay revolves around bluffing and reading bluffs in order to figure out what the clues are. There's almost no other way to deduce the clues except by watching what people are betting.

Simple deduction and bluffing, with multiple usability flaws:
- Tiny text on the board.
- The calling cards do not fit their slots on the board.

And like with most deduction games, anyone giving incorrect answers can ruin the game.

Multiple plays with a different mix of ages and people have all had the same result... three to four rounds of boredom and repetition with one sudden round of "the answer is so obvious and everyone races to get the answer so the person who is first for that round wins". Major Sherlock and mystery game lovers have all been greatly disappointed. The art and the rules (written as though it is a personal letter from Holmes) are the good parts of this game. Everything else seems fairly untested.

The best deduction game I've found. The way information is revealed as players try to score keeps the game moving along, and it's the bluffing element that really makes it. It's almost more about reading what people reveal than deduction, so it's not a laboured process of elimination that a lot of deduction games seem to be. Great for the play time, and the only negative is that it's really only a four player game.

What lifts it above a standard deduction game is that the winner isn't necessarily the first person to 'solve the crime'. Instead, after each guess, you get to place a chit (0, 1 or 2) face down on one of the items. At the end of the game, you get points for chits placed on correct items. This adds a layer of bluff - did he put that token there because that's the bit of information he knows for sure? Or is it a zero, trying to get me to waste one of mine? Gorgeous production too.

Alas, not 2-player! Only for 3-5 players.

Very nice art, good simple Clue-like game. We played 4-player (which seems the ideal number since the mystery has 4 aspects to discover) at Essen and enjoyed it.

There is more psychology / bluffing than Mr. Jack (obvious comparison of mystery game from same publisher) as you "invest" in possible clue solutions based partly on what other players seem to invest in.

Also it is a symmetrical game, unlike Mr. Jack.

But it's not simultaneous (mostly) solitaire like P.I. (other obvious comparison of another Essen 2012 mystery game). You definitely pay attention to what the other players are doing.

RATING: 4
I would like this game if I could do one thing. Write down the clues. Look my memory is awful most of the time. I really like Clue because of the deduction and how you really can work through the solution without having seen all of the information. Just by paying attention to who asks what and who answers. Lady Alice could be like that for me too, and probably would be a better game for me than Clue even. But only if Lady Alice also gave each player a small sheet of paper where they can write down the clues they find. Look, I've had my current phone number for 4 years now and I still have to look it up sometimes. 

Lady Alice just stresses me out when I wish it made me use my powers of deduction and puzzle-figuring out skills. I've played this twice and each time I asked my gaming group to be able to write down the clues I discovered but they adamantly denied the request. I don't know how that would change the game. I would make it less confusing, though. 

One other weakness with the game for me is the system of choosing a red or green card to say if you have the clue in question in your hand. It is too easy to choose the wrong card, and this happened at least a couple of times in the two times we played. Or maybe it didn't no one was really sure. 

But I feel that with just a few small tweaks, I think I could really enjoy this game. Even though the theme makes no sense to me, or didn't come across in the game play to me. Playing as children being trained and tested by Sherlock Holmes.

It's quite nice really. The rule book is a tad different with its conversational tone. That "difference" extends to the game itself. At first glance newbies think they've seen this before, but as the game begins little light bulbs start turning on in players' heads. There's a bunch of bluffing going on with just a tad of deduction and a dash of guessing. The reason all this works is that the time investment is around 20 minutes and it just doesn't risk overstaying its welcome. Nice, quick and engaging. Plays well with the family. It all works well and then it's over. Quite nice.

Played once with 3P. Lady Alice is a mashup between Clue and Mastermind - each player holds a clue to the mystery, and players take turns presenting a set of suspected clues, to which each player then indicates whether the clue is in their hand or not. Of course, it is made more difficult by having the players shuffle their indication cards around, so no-one can tell immediately who holds which clue. A clever twist is that players can bet on which clues are in the final solution, so there is an element of bluffing, and even the player who accuses correctly may not end up the winner.

There is a strong element of memory in this, which may not be to everyone's liking, especially for fans of Clue who are used to taking notes down. However, this is still a good deduction game to play within 30 minutes or so.

1 play, 4er

This is a fun little deduction game, with an unusual twist: instead of trying to figure out which cards were removed from the game, each player has 4 cards (a person, a location, a time, and an item); you're trying to determine one card from each other player's set. So there are MANY possible correct answers ... you just have to find one before the other players do! And you get to bid (so that the solver may not actually win, depending on how they bid) and bluff as well! Very interesting little game!

[b]Summary[/b]
The board is divided into 4 areas, one for each of the card types. Each area has a space corresponding to a specific card. Players each get a card of each type, kept secret, as well as bidding chips (000111222).

On your turn:
1. Suspicion.
Announce a combination of the 4 things (using a flip book to make it easier to visualize), different than the previous player's combination. Everyone simultaneously places a yes/no card into a holder, depending on whether or not they have any of those 4 cards. These are all randomized, then revealed:
- if all 4 are NO, mark those items on the board as FALSE
- if all 4 are YES, you get 1VP; game ends immediately; go to final scoring

2. Action.
Next, starting with the player to your left and going around once, players may choose one action:
- place one of their bidding chips onto a space on the board; max 4 chips/space; if another chip there, reveal its number
- pass; if all players pass consecutively, your turn ends
- accuse: similar to step 1, but with 4 YES votes you get 3VP; and with ANY NO votes, you lose the game (though you keep playing, but only to give info to other players)

[u]End of Game[/u]
Remove all bid chips from the board that:
- belong to players who made false accusations
- are numbered 0
- are on any spaces that were not the 4 identified cards
The player with the highest sum (of bid chips on the board and 1 or 3 VP for ending the game) wins!

RATING: 6.5
If you enjoy Clue and you can get exactly 3 other players around the table, you MUST give this game a try!  It takes Clue, removes all the bad parts (such as the roll and move), and adds a really interesting scoring mechanism.  I quite enjoy it, despite some of the components being somewhat poor quality and the limitation of requiring exactly 4 players for an optimal play experience.  It certainly murders Mystery of the Abbey or any other Clue derivative that I've tried.  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 6.5/10

Deduction game. Sorta. Basic mechanics are a bit like Clue; pick four things and ask about them, find out if anyone has them or not - though not WHO has them. And you are looking for which things people DO have, not which they don't. Nice components.

It says you don't need to take notes. Well, you may not be allowed to take notes, but you certainly NEED to take notes. Or have a really exceptional memory. Not being fond of memory games, that was a big hit against it.

Like many modern deduction games, seems to drop 'deduction' in favor of less interesting elements.

Played at Essen and liked the mechanism of point gathering for clues and the ability to win even if you weren't the first to solve the case.  A different take on the deduction element.  Too bad it only plays five and not more.

A deduction game with some bluffing where you win points at the end if you placed your high point pieces on the correct suspects. It's an interesting mechanic, but it feels incomplete as you play through it.

The Thanksgiving turkey came early this year.  And there wasn't even any gravy.

Innovative mechanic for a deduction game, but I don't agree that you do not need to take notes.

Not for 2p = not really for us. Wife won it on one of Catan championships :)
Had to leave behind in Slovakia.

A neat light deduction game that feels different enough from the typical Clue-style games to stand on its own. However, the game is really short and that brevity actually robs it of possible depth. Sometimes a player can win just out of pure luck. I could see this game having big fans, but it's such a slight and simple little thing that it's hard to adore it. I think it's fine but I honestly was expecting more.

Owned it for two years before I finally got a chance to play it, and I have to say this game has earned my respect.  Sure, it's light and almost completely non-strategic, but there is this sense that with all the little decisions you have to make and the amount of dice-rolling, that the better player will win out.   Our first game was a hoot, with my 8-year-old winning by playing the "Cussing Match" card -- good thing he didn't understand what that meant, but he laughed along with me.  Good stuff.

I also appreciate that this is a very small game:  two different decks of cards and a handful of dice -- to which you must add poker chips or some other counters.  As always, the rules presentation isn't very good, and the rules take a turn or two to become second-nature, but those nits do nothing to diminish the sheer fun of Inn-Fighting.

When my youngest was 6, he excitedly asked me to try the "dice rolling" game he'd invented.  The rules were not, as I discovered, unprecedented:  They involved each player rolling a d6 and comparing the results -- high score wins.   We still laugh about this two years later, but we also silently understand that sometimes, ya just gotta roll them bones.   In that spirit, Inn-fighting is a perfect and very worthwhile little game.

A quick and fun game to emulate the bar room brawl of D&D characters.

Downside, a few cards/rules that could have used better wording or more clarifications.

RATING: 4
Dice fest with almost no mitigating/helpful factors.  Pure luck.  Rates as high as it does for two reasons: (1) it has RPG aspects, and (2) I like the theme and implementation of the theme.  Good for what it is - I just don't happen to like what it is.

Yes, this is a beer & pretzels game.  No, it's not much fun.  Yes, it's probably more fun if played while drinking, though I imagine sticking to the rules would be more problematic.

An enjoyable little dice rolling game with fun characters and mechanics. You will need a huge stash of markers (poker chips or glass beads will do) to keep track of hit points and victory points.
Not much to say here about Inn-Fighting: It's fun and quick. Buying it is certainly no mistake.

RATING: 2
A fantasy themed LCR; light, lucky, and includes various cards which allow you to bend the game rules a bit and mess with your opponents.  While the premise of this may sound nice, the game ultimately plays too long for the luck and lack of decisions involved.  This problem is further extended to game play, where players routinely have to wait and check for the success of various actions taken.  All in all, light fun if you're into this kind of thing, but too mindless and fiddly for me.

EMOTICON REVIEW: :meeple:

27,Sept.08
Just read the rules and sounds like a fun party-ish game.[-]The rulebook was fine, despite all the negative criticism in BGG I figured it out easily.[/-]

04,Oct.08
First session with 4 players didn't go well.There was a lot of downtime since the players weren't familiar with the cards.They didn't want to play again.They find it a little complicated despite the fact that all have played Arkham Horror with amazing ease.I think that the main reason was that all players except me were... women.They 're not very compatible with a tavern fight... :) Also for two of them it was the first time they saw a d20.Not a good sign for a D&D campaign that is coming their way ;)
I liked it a lot and can't wait to play again maybe with a different group.

Want to play a Munchkin-esque game with laughs and violence, but you only want to play for 15 minutes?  This is the game.  I will play this, and I will never play Munchkin again - for whatever that's worth.  This game is fun for exactly as long as it takes to play... an admirable trait.

RATING: 3
Based on 1 play with 5 players: Dull dice game with no real interesting decisions to make. Ontop of that, the endgame conditions seem to exist only to lengthen the game unnecessarily. If you have 20+ VP but don't roll the correct dice, you can't call victory? Bull. And since VP is moving about so often, it seems like this game could easily drag on far, far too long due to nothing more than luck.

I bought this on sale for a few dollars less than the normal purchase price, and was pleasantly surprised to find that it far exceeded my expectations. Fairly light hearted, once you teach everyone to play, you're looking at play times between 10 and 35 minutes, tops.

My one gripe would be that the rules are a tiny bit unclear as regards scoring and a few other important bits, but errata was easy enough to find online.

Inn-Fighting is a very well done direct combat card game with mechanics that give you the feel of actuallying fighting in an inn.  Various characters and bystanders keep this short game from getting stale.  Apparently some people think this game is too long (90+ minutes!), but all the games I have played were probably at most 30 minutes, and most people wanted to immediately play again.

2. Clearly state if the defense die has a memory or not.

RATING: 5
Not such a bad little dice game.  I like some things about the system- the way enemy hit point markers become your VP markers when you get a hit. It comes with six nice custom dice and you set aside certain symbols when rolled and they 'build up' in the middle of the board for someone to use as a chance to heal or draw a card, and then get a bonus turn.   The price is cheap at $14.00, which is right for a filler.  I think a serious gamer will get into the spirit or get really bored with Inn Fighting.  The dice do the driving on all your options and there are very few decisions in this game that mean much.  You roll the dice and the best move is pretty obvious.  It's a game of waiting to see who gets the 'big turn' to thump the opponents. I enjoy it with my son and we crack each others skulls with bar stools quite often.  Very light and silly but a good time, and it has a couple little mechanics in it I think are nice.  I'm looking forward to playing it more.

Initial (pre-play) indications are good—a quick, light [i]D&D[/i]-themed dice game.  Or is it [i]LCR[/i] with loose teeth?

UPDATE:  First play with the kids was fun—it's goofy, you get to roll lots of dice and knock chips off of each other's piles, and it has a hearty slug of [i]D&D[/i] flavor.

UP-UPDATE:  A raucous role-playing romp!  This was the runaway hit of the last gamesday.  We played it at least eight times as a filler, two or three times through in a sitting, with much laughter and smack talk.  Absolutely achieves what it sets out to do...  and there's something deeply satisfying about taking a chair to a Halfling.

[b] “THE PARTY ENTERS AN INN, EVERYONE TAKES A SEAT AT A TABLE IN THE CORNER, ORDER A ROUND OF LOCAL ALE… AND SUDDENLY, ALL HELLS BREAKS LOSE WHEN A TABLE NEXT TO YOU STARTS PLAYING A VERY ODD-LOOKING CARD GAME WITH DICE!” [/b]

At first, seeing this game is based on the D&D universe, of which I had no knowledge whatsoever and really had no interest in learning about it, the game looked boring and a bit too simple. It’s not like the game ended up being some sort of Nobel Prize-worthy work of art, but it really got to me and it was an enjoyable experience. Let it be noted that I was slightly drunk when I learned how to play this and all the while the game lasted. Also, me winning while being sh*t-faced could have resulted in me thinking this was the best game ever.

After a few weeks from that, my friends got me a copy of this game for my birthday and we played it right there and it was an awesome game, to my big surprise, especially because I was not drinking that day. From that day on, all D&D based games and simple package card games have never been underestimated again before actually playing them.

On the subject of the game itself, the mechanics are quite interesting. One can not hurt or attack the players that are not right next to oneself, much like it would be in a real bar fight, where a poor bastard’s fight in one corner of the place has nothing to do with another dumbass’ fight in the opposite room. But let’s nor forget, it’s the D&D universe we’re talking about, so magical powers and throwing weapons allow the players to actually hit the players that are not next to them. And those powers, as expected from one of the most rich Fantasy RPGs  ever created, are not silly or weak. They are actually very devastating, if the player controlling them knows how to use them properly.

The presence of dice in the game is also a note-worthy element. On one hand, dice represent the ever present randomness and chance notes on a game, but that’s not the only thing they do. And on the other hand, related to the other thing dice do in this game, you can actually use them to determine if your blows land on some face or stomach and if so, how strong players hit each other. This blows and actions, and sometimes “misses” themselves can be modified using the players’ character qualities and personal abilities, all based in the character’s race and class, and which level they are in a certain moment.

But before finishing this review, it should be noted that the game, for all those not familiarized or interested in the D&D universe and/or RPG games in general, the game might drag on and it will eventually bore them or just lack sense and logic. As fair and sometimes logical (Even for fans of this game as well) that that may sound, the game mechanics themselves are fun and simple and very straightforward, with a few “buts” here and there.

The player who reaches level 10 in the game wins. Sounds easy, but it’s not.  What’s a real certainty about Inn Fighting is that it’s a fun game for the occasional RPG gamer and fan of party games. And despite the fact that I try not to drink a lot, having a beer while playing this game truly makes you feel a bit “feisty”.

[b][i]II. Sliders[/i][/b]

Abstract [b]_______[COLOR=#FF0000][8][/COLOR]__[/b] Themed: Just as with the D&D miniature game, though the game is completely set in the Dungeons & Dragons’ universe, I can’t help thinking the core mechanics and other certain elements could be very well adapted to other environments and situations. Maybe not historical games, but certainly alternative history or other fantasy of sci-fi settings could use this game for their own scenarios, but none of them would work just as well, since the whole leveling idea and certain powers and ideas behind the game are too focused on it working primarily for D&D.

Simple [b]___[COLOR=#FF0000][4][/COLOR]______[/b] Complex: The rules are really easy to learn, but hard to actually master. Not many loopholes and doubts will appear after two or three game sessions of Inn Fighting, but there will always exist certain spots of uncertainty. But all of these problems almost never actually show up, so the game runs pretty smoothly. Its simplicity relies on the turn flow and actions rather than on the rule book.

Strategic [b]_______[COLOR=#FF0000][8][/COLOR]__[/b] Tactical: Picture yourself in a bar, surrounded with monsters and creatures drinking heavily and acting a bit too aggressively towards each other and yourself. If a fight breaks out, it’s hard to think a strategy would work to win the game, especially when the guys next to you are stronger, faster or bigger than you. A good idea for this game is that most of it you’ll spend it looking for the right moment while fending off some drunk idiots blows and spells. And don’t count on your buddies, their hand are full too. 
 
Luck [b]__[COLOR=#FF0000][3][/COLOR]_______[/b] Skill: Sometimes you’ll hit the other guy, sometimes you’ll miss him, and sometimes, both things will happen. It all depends on the dice and how good you are managing the cards you have and the friends you have by your side. But mostly the dice will determine the outcome of a certain decision.

Fiddly [b]______[COLOR=#FF0000][7][/COLOR]___[/b] Elegant: Like I said before, the rules are quite clear and not very usually doubts and questions about them will arise and bring the game to a halt before they’re solved, but this situations are rare. However, reading the whole rules once or twice before playing is recommended, especially for players without much knowledge of the D&D games.
 
Indirect interaction [b]_________[COLOR=#FF0000][10][/COLOR][/b] Direct interaction: Dude, it’s a bar fight... Start punching, throwing chairs and cursing people!

Cutthroat [b]____[COLOR=#FF0000][5][/COLOR]_____[/b] Friendly: As a party game and filler, the game itself is meant to be entertaining and funny, due to the mishaps of a game with dice and the sometimes ludicrous situations that occur while playing. A game this simple cannot be too dependant on the players’ attitude of killing each other at all cost, nor can it be meant for it to be a game of joking and not caring about winning.

Heavy use of language [b]_______[COLOR=#FF0000][7][/COLOR]___[/b] No language needed: There’s a lot of text in the character and event cards and learning how to read them and apply them is also a very important part of the game. But it could be noted that there is not THAT MUCH text in them, because symbols are also present and sometimes they’re quite enough.

Didn't really get into this game.  Seemed like you were aimlessly rolling dice in hopes to roll a certain icon.  You could do this with any kind of dice, there are no decisions to be made you turn is based on what you roll (you don't even really get to pick who you fight, the dice do it for you).
Not very fun.  Would passionately vote against playing this again.  I was even kicking around the idea of buying it, glad I played it first.

Terrible game. The dice dictate practically everything - including whether you attack, who you attack, and how you attack. The sole decision in the game is whether to attack a player's character or his bystanders, and whether to use an action card if you have one. Given the VP bonus for the bystanders and their easiness to kill, if you choose not to attack the bystanders first then you deserve to lose. Some choice.

Can't really describe this game. Many rules to pay attention to (especially Bystander modifications) and text on cards are a bit small. The game is a bit too fiddly for proper gameplay, but if you just want to roll dice and have fun then it doesn't matter.

Out of the box the rules for this game are terrible.  Incomplete and confusing.  There appears to be an interesting game here, but unless you are interested in filling in the blanks and making "house rulings" on almost every page of the rules, avoid this game.  The game re-creates a tavern brawl, but don't be surprised if a fist fight breaks out over the rules as written.

I like dice games and this one looks interesting, but the rules are in need of serious editing and clarification.

Update:  See forum thread http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/1895945#1895945 for rule clarifications.  These clarifications go a long way to filling the gaping holes that exist in the printed rules.  With these clarifications, I have raised my rating from '3' to '5'.

Silly little filler where you roll dice, declare a target, roll some more dice, and keep doing so until someone gets 20 victory points. D&D theme. Better games out there that do this, a la King of Tokyo.

RATING: 2.5
Something of a step forward for the category of the take that card game, in that it is over pretty quickly (at least with three players that know the rules) and there is something of an actual game there. Card balance is a bit dodgy, but not catastrophic. Certainly acceptable for the genre. Nevertheless, it [i]is[/i] a take that game, and it also falls down by making every single effect unique. This makes learning the effects a rather extreme exercise, and barring heavy play, I don't think most people will ever really learn most of them.At the end of the day, this is the best of its category that I know of, but the category is not one I care to visit too often. I could really burn out or get frustrated with Inn-Fighting if I had to play it too often.UPDATE: Played twice with four players. While it adds a little around the edges, it also makes the game noticeably longer on average.I've also realized just how close this is to being LCR with a 12 page rulebook. While I'm not dropping my rating just now, I can see total burnout, and a precipitous drop in rating, on the horizon.UPDATE: Not much game here. 90% of the time you are being played by the dice rather than the other way 'round. The Action (special power) cards seem to be rather marginal and uninteresting more often than not, to boot, while, once in a while, providing huge, game-altering, swings. I could really use a break from this. Down to 3.5

This is a dice-fest, a veritable dance with lady-luck, fast, fun and surprisingly for a D&D game, ooozing with cleavage-based theme.

RATING: 8.25
Rating is based on the type of game this is- lighter, dice rolling, luck plays a part, some randomness due to cards, fast, humourous.  I enjoyed it as it played fast, you do have some decision making and strategy, but nothing terrible.  The best part was there was a nice variety each time we played and you seemed close to winning at times.  There did not seem to be a runaway-from-the pack-leader-gets-stronger aspect to our games.  There's too many ways to beat down someone who jumps out ahead.  Yet it didn't go on and on even though players try to keep a leader in check. It allows for players to have some decison making as to what's the best thing to do each turn, and not just random luck, throw the dice and hope for the best turns.We laughed throughout the game, and all agreed, this game makes a nice, engaging filler.  Glad I picked up a copy...useed (like new), for $7.00.  A bargain!

Initial rating - 6- based on one 5-p game with some play errors. Would like to re-play. 

The character cards are nicely illustrated. The action cardss display a dissapointing lack of quality graphic design. There is a lot of empty space. 

Furthermore there are 7 cards that are poorly worded, vague or ambiguous. There are 2 sets of 2 cards that mechanicly seem to accomplish the same thing, yet they are worded differently. 

Bystanders should have a 2 VP KO bonus tag, mon or icon on them to be consistent with the character cards.

I don't see why this game got such low reviews.  For what it is, it does it very well.  Is it the deep strategic game of Puerto Rico? No.  Or the fun role play fighting game of Arkham Horror? No.

But it is a very simple, fast pasted fun game.  It has a very low level of play, pretty much entirely luck based, family fun game.  And it has great replay value.

Should have some penalty for being KO'd.

A stupid-fun die-rolling game, where what you roll dictates who you hit (player to the left, right or with most VPs) and then roll again to see how much damage you incur based on what your character sheet says. The defender gets to roll a defense die which may trigger their character's defense ability. Get VPs for damage you incur. Rolling enough dice symbols can get you action cards, which mix it up, or additional characters. First to 20 VPs wins. It's simple. It's stupid. It's fast and fun with the right crowd and it matches to theme very nicely indeed.

6 - I've held custody of this game for nearly 7 years before finally playing a full game.  When it was originally purchased it was expected to be a light drinking themed game but upon opening and discovering that it's similar to LCR with a bunch of cards with rules all over them it was sealed back up and forgotten about until a week ago.  I've been expanding my gaming over the past couple years so I decided it was worth giving another chance.  A few of the fiddly bits we had trouble with initially (health counters being returned to the bank and exchanged for victory coutners) still seem unnecessary but they are not difficult.

Received as a white elephant gift at @mad-katt's Christmas party 2014!
1st play rules impressions: The rules scenarios that come up even in a first play are rather horrendous, and make it hard to determine proper play. Some are covered in the rulebook if you read every line, many are not. It makes it hard to slog through an understanding of the gameplay.

House Rules & just some clarifications: (taken from http://acknak.blogspot.com/2007/11/faq-inn-fighting.html) 
* Always re-roll the defense die during your turn. Only the GOLD DICE Action results are kept between turns. 
* So is Initiative rolled every round (then re-rolled once the first player's turn comes up again), or only once at the beginning of the game?!?
* The Power dice target an opponent with the highest VP.
* Even if you have >=20 VP, you have to do damage to an opposing Adventurer to win.
* You never roll defense dice for damage coming from somewhere other than an Attack on you.
* Redirected damage (VP) is given to the person redirecting the damage, not who originally caused it. This can be caused by Bystanders blocking an attack, then causing damage to a different player.
* If your Adventurer is knocked out, do you have to skip a turn when getting your new one, or do you get a fresh one and attack right away?  If it's the latter, than it's a significant advantage to get an Adventurer knocked out, since you are defended when you don't have an Adventurer.
* If there is no Adventurer on your left and you only rolled dice that allow you attack that left Adventurer, you must pass your turn (i.e. you don't "skip" Adventurers that aren't there)
* Special Power effects are applied, whether you get the low or the high damage result.
* The action card Second Swing has a typo. It shouldn’t be talking about re-rolling the Brawl Dice you used for the attack; it should say “Reroll the d20 you used to make the attack.” In other words, you play Second Swing when you’ve rolled a 1 on your attack roll, or rolled low damage when what you need is to roll high.
* Xxyzzt, Beholder Barfly keeps Power attacking as long as he gets High attack result. [i]Reduce High damage to 4[/i] (the extra attack is damaging enough, much less the chance to keep getting High Power attacks).

the Rules could be better organized and I wish that they would have packed a bigger box with counter beads or chits or something of that sort.  If not for some RPG dice on hand, it all would have been SOL for the first play.

The gameplay is fun and though one must think, it's not so heavy a task to sort the game out.

Pros:
- Light-hearted, silly.  Great party game.
- It can be expanded beyond the recommended # of players.  Doing this of course makes the game longer.
- Relatively easy to learn.  Takes a bit of explaining to get started but once the game gets moving people figure it out pretty quick.

Cons:
- There are a few obscure rules that you have to dig around in the rule book to find that make a significant impact on play if you forget about them (which we frequently do).  I'll probably need to make a cheat sheet for next time.

RATING: 6
A very light, simple game with a lot of dice rolling and randomness. Feels like Munchkin but it WILL end in a reasonable amount of time. 

Everyone is a character with variable HP and skill, and 3 forms of attacks (punch, hit with chair, power). Also, may have defense abilities. Each is dealt 2 special action cards which are either actions (played as described) or bystanders (played immediately to your play area when you get them). 

On your turn you roll available dice (6 at start of game). Faces: punch, chair, power, ale, luck. Ale and luck are only usable if at least 3 are rolled; if not, all of these are set aside. Attacks are: punch left, chair right, or power to player with most VP. Attack is a d20   1/symbol you rolled of the attack type; roll above your skill to do the higher damage, below to do lower. Can attack either player or their bystanders (if any). If you do >2 damage or knock target out (do as much or more damage as their HP), they roll the defense die and apply relevant effects. You get VP equal to HP damage they take, plus bonus for knocking them out of game (bonus shown on card). 
Ale action: player with most VP loses as many VP as you rolled ales; you gain those in HP (up to your starting HP). Then, reroll all dice.
Luck action: draw a special action card, then reroll all dice.
At the end of your turn, you leave the ale and luck dice on the table and pass the other dice to the left.

First player to get to 20VP AND do damage to another player on that turn wins the game.

Eh... fun mindless game that I'd play every once in a great while. The main problem I have with the game (besides the huge luck factor and such) is the random fiddly rules. I understand they were trying to keep the D&D flavor, but having all these weird rules just bogs down the game. There is no real player aid that says Bystander knock outs give 2 bonus VP, or that rolling a 1 is an auto miss and a 20 is a crit. How much bonus damage does a crit do? Well, you have to look it up... just like the majority of the obscure rules. Oh well, it is what it is: a light mindless filler. I just think something like King of Tokyo is more fun for the time spent.

Vary vague rules.  Needs clarification or house rules.  House rules solve all problems except luck. This game is basically 90% luck and acting as determined by 1 dice roll. 

House Rule 1: To add strategy to the game, we've decided to trade dice rules for the "BANG! Dice Game" rules. Players roll all white dice to start, get 2 Re-Rolls of any number of dice, and keep any dice desired. All dice are resolved on last roll, pass the dice.  Heal or Luck actions can be resolved with punch, chair, and power attack actions on the same turn, but players do not re-roll after resolving "actions". Do not use Red die except for defense rolls.

House Rule 2: For each punch/chair die rolled, the player may attack one step farther in that direction. P1 Bystander, P1 Adventurer, P2 Bystander, P2 Adventurer, etc.

We played this at a party with 6 people and we needed ages to get into the rules... After we got the rules game pace was really slow and fun didn't occur (at least for me). For a quick action-loaded party fun I would recommend Munchkin (lighter rule set, more funny), but not this game. Sorry.

The box cover says "a D&D dice game" and that's exactly what we're getting here. For me it's a bit too confused and not really so fast either, what with calculating all the exceptions of exceptions that backfire on the attacker at +1 +2 +2 per bystander except on Bank Holidays when a -1 also applies.

Simple, but a blast. Anyone can play this one, make sure you have enough counters. 

The box finally gave out. This is now sleeved in a Plano box with Zombie Dice, a deck of cards, and a ton of glass counters. I may very well keep the Plano in the car as these are the most popular 'anywhere' games I have.

RATING: 5
Its a beer and pretzels hack em wack em.  With regular play, and familiarity with the cards and the rules and the characters and the powers this could raise to as high as an 8.  It is doubtful I will ever accrue that experience, so it just seems like a weird form of a munchkin type game, except it would improve with experience instead of decrease in fun.  It is a once in awhile game, that would shine with repeated play.  This leaves it as an average game, take it or leave it.

Fun light and what the heck.  Fully luck driven of course but neat custom dice and theme is rich.  Much better than 3 Dragon Ante.  Very affordable to boot.

[thing=29198][/thing] is a a dice game where the players assume the control of adventurers and bystanders in a big brawl in the Inn. The attack can happen in three ways: with the fist (attack the player in the left), with the chair (attack the player in the right) or with the thunderbolt (attack the player with most VPs - wich can be yourself).

The round is pretty simple: roll the dice and separate the ones with especial symbols (beer or dice). If the separated dice didn't amount to three dice of one type or more, the player then uses the remaining dice to attack. As I said, the attack comes in three ways, and every adventurer might have different ways to deal with them (a higher amount of damage, or something like this). The player decides the type of attack to be used and chooses which card he will attack (a bystander or the adventurer - to attack the adventurer, the attacker must use 2 or more dice of the same type, so, say, if the attacker only rolled one chair, he must used to attack a bystander, if the player in the right has at least one of them). Then the player rolls a d20 to see if the attack will use the bigger amount of damage (if he rolls equal or higher the Skill number for the adventurer) or the smaller one (if he rolls bellow the Skill number). If a 20 is rolled, the attack gives +1 damage and cannot be defended; if a 1 is rolled, the attack deals -1 damage (which can be zero). Then the defender player rolls the defende die (the red one), to see if the adventurer (or the bystander) manage to fend off the attack, applying the special effects, if any.

For every point of damage dealt, the attacker takes as victory points. If the attack bring down an adventurer, the attacker also gains the knockout bonus (for bystanders the bonus is always 2 VP).

The player then passes the dice to the next player. The dice rolled that got a special result, aren't rolled again until it has three or more dice of the same type. When this happens, the player of the turn can use them to recover hit points (the same amount as the dice with the beer symbols), taking the points from the pool of VPs of the player with the most VPs. Or take an special card (with three or more dice with the dice symbol); the special cards come in two types: the actions (which remain in the hand of the player until he/she uses it) and the bystanders - these must be put in the table immediately. The player of the turn can only use the special dice once in his turn.

The game goes until one player reaches 20 points and, in the same round that this happens, he/she manage to give at least one point of damage. If the player reaches 20 points, but didn't do damage, the game continues, until someone have 20 or more points and do damage in his/her turn.

[thing=29198][/thing] has a little more to it, but this is basically what it is. The game isn't long and, yes, luck plays a huge part on it, but, being quick, I don't mind at all. You will need some way to track the hit points of the adventurers and bystanders - the game don't provide this for you (to keep the box small and the cost low).

[thing=29198][/thing] do have more choices to it than [thing=70323][/thing], but if you didn't liked this one, you will probably don't like [thing=29198][/thing] - you will still be at the mercy of the dice, you cannot even re-roll them (only if you got three dice for the special action, because then you must re-roll the dice).

I wasn't thrilled by it, being more fiddly than [thing=70323][/thing], and the theme for this sort of brawling game works better, for me, with huge monsters.

Good production value. Filler game. Chaotic & lots of luck involved, but it moves fast, so I enjoyed it. 

I actually like enjoy the dice dictate who gets hit. Unlike a lot of "take that" games, it doesnt feel like you're getting "ganged up on" if you start getting hit a lot.

Pretty cool game for a dicefest. The game suffers the same drawbacks as other dicegames (variable game length, bad dice rolls might leave you feeling out of control, etc.), but it plays different enough from other such games to be a worthwile addition to anyone's collection. Add an extra point to the score if you had some exposure to the D&D roleplaying game at some point in your life.

This card and dice game is set in the D&D universe. The setting is a tavern brawl where you have a character with special abilities and you roll a special set of dice that determines the outcome of rounds of fighting. I like this one.

Can be very quick, but a lot of luck is involved.  It can also be annoying that the person in the lead is constantly being harrassed, and someone often wins by just having his/her turn arrive at the right time.

The dice game of champions in the Dungeons & Dragons world.
From the creators of Three-Dragon Ante, the Dungeons & Dragons in-world card game, comes the perfect dice game for D&D players and characters alike. With a roll of the dice, you determine whether to hurl a mug of ale at the warbling bard or smash a chair over the drunken barbarian's back. Treachery and chaos abound, as every game promises a new and hilarious tavern brawling experience. Inside every Inn Fighting box you'll find a rules sheet, a set of 6 special six-sided dice, 1 twenty-sided die, and 52 character cards. Choose a character, trade some dice rolls with your friends, and see who's left standing in the end!
Rob Heinsoo is a Senior Game Designer at Wizards of the Coast, Inc. He co-wrote the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting, worked on several sets for the Dungeons & Dragons Miniatures Game, and designed the popular Three-Dragon Ante card game.

Had fun playing it.  A great quick game to play while waiting for the rest of the party to show up.  There was a lot of back and forth in the game, it is hard to hang on to a lead.  I am looking forward to expansions for this.  Also hoping that someone will come up with 2 player rules.

Rob Heinsoo (the designer) knocked it out of the park for me with "Three-Dragon Ante", so I really wanted to check out his follow-up game. However, Inn-Fighing really didn't bring much to the table - too lucky, a little long, a touch too complex...not a crushing disappointment, but I wish it had been better.

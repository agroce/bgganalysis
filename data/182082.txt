Now this is what vanilla Carcassonne should have been in the first place! A simple yet challenging game without any fiddliness; and without any of the nonsense of most of the expansions. Apart from Hunters & Gatherers and Carc the Castle, this is probably the best Carcassonne has to offer: and it's the trail mechanism that does it!

The weakest game in the Carcassonne family, in my opinion. I was initially drawn by the farming theme and the cute little fruit and veggie tokens, but they didn't add as much interest as I thought they would. Furthermore, the hiker action just felt silly and ill-thought-out. I tried to save this game with some house rule tweaks (modifying what the hiker does, and adding in some lakes like in the Inns and Cathedrals expansion for vanilla Carc), but in the end they weren't enough.

Plays pretty much the same as the original Carcassonne with some slight variations. I've played the original way too much with my wife, so it's always nice to bring this version out to the table

We bought this because my wife loved the description on the box. We both love Carcassonne so she thought we would like this too. This this would be great to teach to nongamer children. a very stripped down version of Carcassonne.

I love this version, it's my favourite after South Seas, yet I seem to play it more, probably because it's less fiddly...

Components: Sturdy tiles; pleasing artwork. The various gardens look great when the game is done. Constrasted to the thematically lifeless original, this is more like Hunters & Gatherers, with its various animals and orchards populating the tiles.

Experience: Just as fun as original Carcassonne. The different crops make equally-sized fields have different values. The animals are easier to score than traditional fields, and yet more fun than abbeys. The traveler option in particular makes roads much more interesting. Overall an improvement. Not as fun as Hunters & Gatherers, but my second favorite of the seven Carcassonne installments I've played.

A nice Carcassonne variant.   If I didn't have Carc already, this would be a good version to get, or to give as a gift.    The moving along the roads is a nice addition.   The way cities are scored with tokens and the farm scoring were neither better nor worse for me...  just different, but nice for a change.

Way too luck-based for my taste: In my one play, one player got heaps of tiles with tokens (12 at the end, including 2 sets!), and I got lots of road ends, so little chance to attack fields or use the wanderer.

RATING: 7
Carcassonne: Over Hill and Dale is a good variation on traditional Carcassonne. We like the "hiking" rule for wanderers and think that we will use this rule in the original game to enhance the value of roads. We also like the harvest tokens.

Great mechanism, great art! It's always a enjoyable thing to just look at the animals portrayed on the tiles. The best standalone version in the whole Carcassonne family by far.

Stand-alone Carcassonne. Makes for a good introduction to new players.
In this one, each time you extend a road that you have a meeple on, the meeple can move to an end of the road, and you score a point for each tile it moved over. This makes building long roads attractive and may incentive other people to cap your roads bwaha. 
Instead of "cities", there are "garden fields". Closing a garden still scores points, but also awards tokens. Collecting tokens will give points at game end. Also having a set of 5 unique tokens gives an extra 10 points.

It's a nice Carcassonne variant with a more kid-friendly approach than usual: both the theme (gardening, wandering and animals) and the artwork (everything is closer than usual so the animals are quite big and you can even see the fruit in the gardens) make it probably the best theme to introduce younger girls (and kids overall) to the world of Carcassonne. I'm also happy that after Doris Matthäus's art was unforgivably replaced by the new edition of Carcassonne & expansions, she did the artwork here, and she used warm, sunny colors for a very pleasant artwork that is a pleasure both to the eye and the heart.
And the mechanism is also a lot more interesting than what I expected after first reading. Fruit etc. tokens don't feel very new after the banana of Seaside, gold nuggets of Gold rush and some expansions like the products of Traders&Builders and the sheep of Hills & sheep, but it's okay. Roads (at last!) can generate quite a lot of points now with the walking rules, which might even result in your opponent intentionally closing your routes. And while the most problematic part of old Carcassonne, farm scoring was completely missing from Carc Star Wars ("boys' Carc" released at the same time as this one), it is kind of missing here as well. But only kind of, as houses are like a mix of fishing huts from Hunters&Gatherers (in that you have two of them here and they are placed and not moved), the farm scoring rule from most Carc spin-offs after Carcassonne (where you scored farms and their equivalents for items, most often animals, that were on them) and cloisters (as you score only for the animals on the 3x3 tiles surrounding your house).
All in all, it's a well-assembled, friendly Carc game which might be fitting some families even more than the original.

(I just hope there would be expansions released - I miss having "road, farm, farm, farm" tiles. :D )

FUN: a little better than the original as it makes roads more interesting, adds the goods from the 2nd expansion and simplifies farmers en cloisters into one.

UNIQUE: all of these Carcassonne versions feel like small variations on the base game.

NEGATIVES: I don't feel like it's worth it to own all these Carcassonne versions.

The analysis that this is 'Carcassonne done right' is pretty much bang on. With less to worry about from a geometric front, a much-needed boost for paths, removal of some of the draw luck, and a diverting little set-collection sub-game, this is a far more enjoyable experience than the original.

A nice standalone Carcassonne game. Nice game balance and complexity level.  Really great art on the tiles.

It's a cute and relaxing variation. Feels less mean than standard Carc, but still with opportunities for stealing/ sharing points.

Nada de especial sem ser a mecânica da boleia, que teria sido mais gira se fosse implementada numa nova expansão para o jogo base, com um novo meeple exclusivo para essa função. Os tokens de cultivo não funcionam, não há qualquer oportunidade estratégica de preferir um token em detrimento de outro, mais valia usarem a regra dos "Comerciantes e Construtores", permitindo a quem fechasse um cultivo ficar com os tokens, embora sem pontos diretos. Os estábulos são uma macacada, não tiram proveito dos diversos animais ilustrados... É bonito e apresentável, mas o pior jogo "Carcassonne" até à data!

Really good family game when you're in the mood for something laidback with the odd bit of meanness. This is a much better version for children as more easily understood conceptually and visually than the original version. My five yr old can play play it quite well.

RATING: 8
Not quite as fun as Hunters & Gatherers and the original, but the limitation makes it a bit of a challenge in some ways. Fields and the bonus crops are the way to get big points. I don't find I do much "wandering" down the roads.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
Fun & mostly peaceful Carcassonne variant that lets you collect fruits and veggies for end game bonuses and wander up and down roads for extra in-game scoring. This one won't replace Base plus Inns/Traders or even (m)any of the other better variants, but will make it to the table from time to time when we are looking for a quicker, relaxing tile laying experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The rule about walking your meeple makes roads a little more interesting, but doesn't really change the game much. The stables and animals were a lot of fun though. Like most of the variants, this is probably a step up from the original game.

[Z-man 15 Edition] {Carcassonne; tile-laying, set-collection; optimal 3-4p} A lovely twist of Carcassonne.  Now, road scoring is more interesting.  Players can score a road multiple times by moving the hikers around.

It is still a family game, but it is more deep than original Carcassonne. Yet, it's more approachable to children for its components and illustration.

I like the 72 tiles.  Now each person has the same number of turns.

The tile illustration is lovely.  It's very children family.  The harvest tokens are cute but it would be wonderful if the tokens become meeples.

Originally, I didn't plan to buy it but it seems it's going OOP.  A FLGS is doing a sale.  So, I grab a copy.


++Hiker wandering to score roads multiple times
+Collect harvest tokens to score additional points, but similar to traders
=Stable is the Monastery
=Path is Road
=Field is City

tl;dr: good but unremarkable

It's good because it is very, very similar to the original. It is unremarkable exactly because it is so similar. It take elements we know from the original or some of it's expansions and rearranges them a bit. For instance the cloisters and farmers are replaced with barns. They have the range of a cloister, but are placed on fields and give you points for the amount of animals depicted on the tiles. Different, but very familiar at the same time.
So this definitely is a very good game, be it a bit redundant.

Nice variation on the original game. A few little changes - the meeple on the path can now walk and gain a point making each path tile worth 2 points (potentially). The placement of the stables has to be watched so that you gain the maximum number of possible points. Fun to play using much of the same strategy used for the original Carcassonne.

RATING: 7.5
Played the draft beta version, not the new kickstarter that was only live for five days and coming out this summer. It felt a lot like Hive with the placement and movement of the tiles, but the scoring adds a lot of tactical decisions. Only some tiles are worth points, and those tiles can be for either player depending on if they are black-side or white-side up and most of the other tiles will flip and move things around. Looking at the kickstarter the rules have been changed a bit (play 2 tiles per turn instead of one) and I think it makes for a better game. It's tough to rate the earlier version, but I still had a good time with it. The production value wasn't that great, but I expect the kickstarter to be better. My biggest criticism is that their campaign only lasted 5 days! If it was up again I would definitely back it but now I'll have to hope it has a large enough release to snag a copy. A really fun 2 player abstract in its earlier form and the new edition might move it up a notch.

Neat 2p abstract tile laying game.  This game reminds me of innovation, in that you do have interesting decisions to make, but there is also a lot of chaos that can occur.  I don't really mind the chaos here though, since the game only last around 45min.  I usually am not a fan of Asmadi games' art direction, but I think the direction they took with this one actually looks good and is very functional (Unlike innovation & impulse to name a few...).  Looking forward to playing more to see how the tiles coming out differently will affect the overall feel of the game!

Great little game.  So good I backed the Kickstarter for the full version which as it turns out is even better.  Eventually I sold my beta edition.

I'm glad I picked-up the full release.  The original was good, but this is just a little better.  The components are much nicer, and the play more interesting.  I still wish I could play it a little faster.

Seems primarily tactical / greedy, but with enough longer-term ramifications involved to satisfy me. The relevance of spatial positioning is also a big plus, of course. :-)

I like the "new tiles cost to play" mechanic; it mitigates the swing of the draft board replenishing - though from my one game so far, I wonder if 1 point is enough!

RATING: 7
Two-player tile laying game; try to end up with the most tiles with your color face up, and each tile has a special ability or action on playing. Quite straightforward, benefits from knowing all the tile abilities. Maybe a half hour?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Sort of a Cosmic Hexagonal Othello: special powers on every tile, and you're battling to flip more tiles to your own color.  But with a small dash of randomness (a draw deck, with a pool of 5 tiles face-up at any time) to keep it from being static.

Juego de colocación de losetas, basado en el draft de losetas, los combos y las mayorías con bastante azar, mucho que leer en las losetas y las aclaraciones de las mismas, y decisiones demasiado evidentes. Diseño feo, juego largo y con constantes vaivenes: da la sensación de que muy mal hay que jugar durante la partida para que al final no sea al que mejor le salgan las losetas en las dos últimas rondas quien gane.

Fun little game, though it's hard to say how to play well. I like this game for reasons that aren't necessarily good -- I like hexes, tile placement, and arbitrary "do some stuff to other tiles" mechanics.

RATING: 5
The drafting's neat, as is the way the game seems to organize itself into several mini-games depending on what order tiles come out in.

But in my one play it combined two things which are hard for me to like-- one, a tug of war that involves undoing your opponent's progress and having yours undone in return, and two, a need to visualize branching trees of moves several turns ahead. I can enjoy either of those in the right circumstances, but maybe not together and in any case probably not here.

Excellent two-player game.  Unique tiles makes it very tarot-like.  Unfortunately, can be brutal on inexperienced players.

RATING: 6.5
Terrific idea, could lead to some AP when considering all the options each turn, but if you play it is a semi-light abstract game, you should do fine. The components look *really* drab, though.

RATING: 6
Equinox really feels like an unholy union. There are parts of Othello, Hive, Innovation (or any other game with a bit of Chudyk madness), and Roborally (or some other game with programming). The short of it is lay two hex-shaped tiles, activitating their crazy immediate, passive, or game-end effects accordingly -- mostly for the purposes of flipping tiles to your colour (i.e., white or black). However, it's not always that simple, there are tiles that act as gravitational wells (i.e., upcoming tiles must be placed adjacent), overcast shadows or street lamps (i.e., all tiles must be placed on their black or white side respectively), amongst other things. The game ends with a programmed sequence in which effects become increasingly devastating (e.g., the last one being to remove the said tile and all tiles surrounding it).

Were it not for a tile market to draft tiles from (as well as the clever rule which dis-incentivizes players from taking newly flipped tiles -- at the cost of giving their opponent an easy point), this game could be a serious AP mess (especially with the ~10 end-game tiles that need to be considered). However, the game continues to feel highly tactical in that, because the board continues to be reshaped (something to avoid dreadful situations), strategic outlook is always foggy at best. My rating could go up with more plays.

I was intrigued, and then got a chance to demo.  I still worry about it being too abstract, but it has kept me thinking about it and wanting to try it some more.  So it's gotta have some fun there.

A few plays in makes it seem like it was indeed too abstract and brain-burny to rise above the amount of fun it provides.

I was expecting so little about this game that it actually worked. However, the game has a lot of problems: too much information, too long for what it is, too random. Some good interaction with the tiles, but some very overpowered.

Beautiful minimalist design that treats you to an interesting intellectual exercise with just enough randomness to not feel like a traditional abstract game.

RATING: 7
Played once.  Two player abstract.  Very similar to Hive in some ways, but with triple the types of tiles.  Really, not a bad abstract at all.  The first several rounds are semi-random, in that you really have no idea how the end of the game will play out, but once the board come into better focus, you have real tough decisions to make.

Like a lighter Lagoon. I like the take that aspect of the game. It is mostly tactical, though, with the only strategy I could think of being to lock important tiles so that they're harder to flip.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a tile-placement game in which the tiles, black on one side and white on the other, can flip or move other tiles, changing who is ahead at any given moment. Additionally, there are some tiles that don't activate until the end of the game. It's tough to get a feel for how things are going, especially when you're new to the game and don't know what kinds of tiles await you in the bag that could severely alter your position. It's more interesting than I initially gave it credit, but there are other things I'd rather play.

RATING: 6
This is one of the best random Kickstarters I've backed. It combines two of my favorite mechanics: tile laying and drafting. I played it a fair amount with one of my co-workers at a past job, and I hope it gets more playtime in the future. I rarely play games with only 1 other person, so it sits on the shelves more than it should.

Excellent two player game.  Plays very fast, many cool options, constant change, interesting scoring, and fun to play.  My wife slaughtered me in our first two games, and I won the last game by one point.  She could could have placed her last tile next to my Freedom, too, but didn't see that!  Very addictive.

Reminded me of Lagoon: Land of Druids but way less pretty. Very abstract and all of the tiles have certain "powers" you have to remember everything and place accordingly. I had lost interest by the end of it. Definitely not a game for me.

RATING: 7
Combolicious 2p tile game from Asmadi. The 35 unique tiles are each double-sided (black and white) and players take turn to place one and enact its special power. The aim is to have more tiles on your side at the end of the game. I've only played once so far but there's lots to explore and it's quick and easy to teach.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The comparisons to Hive make no sense to me.

Light tile laying game where each tile has some unique special power. More tactical rather than strategic -- you might be able to do some planning once you've learned the entire tile set -- all tiles are played in the game -- but luck of the draw seems to nullify this.

Choices, choices, options, options. You're placing hexes with identical text on both sides - a black and a white side. The hexes come in four categories and you're playing either black or white side. You'll receive a point for each tile of yours face up at the end of the game, some end of game scoring bonuses (blue band category hexes), glass beads for immediate scoring and compensation for not having the chance to place a new hex tile.  Reds band hexes have an immediate effect flipping tiles. Purple band hexes have an ongoing effect for the duration of the game. Yellow hexes do stuff immediately.

Playing two hexes down a turn you have the chance to get some good combos in if you can see them. Then your opponent has a go.

The game would be crazy chaotic with more than two players, but thankfully it's two player only in a nice snug box. It can be a bit confusing factoring in all the purple effect cards and some of their extended effects beyond their immediate neighbours. After a bit you'll get the hang of it. I'm looking forward to more plays.

RATING: 4
Tile-laying game with unique actions on each tile.  I'm not sure how I feel about it.  There's a lot of luck in the tile draw, and I'm not sure there's much reward in long-term planning, so there may be too much randomness in the game for my tastes.  Time will tell if only the last few moves are meaningful, and the rest is an extended prologue.  If so, the rating could go lower.  If not, it could go higher, but not much.

RATING: 7
Like Innovation, another Asmadi Games release, Equinox is a game of broken combos -- but there are so many wild, broken, swingy combos that somehow it all works out even.

There are 47 unique, double-sided tiles (white/black), worth one point to the relevant player (white/black) if face up. Some have special powers when placed (Hook: pick up a previously-placed tile and move adjacent to Hook), some activate at the end of the game (Betrayal: +1 point for each different-sided tile adjacent) and some have persistent, distorting effects (Charisma: tiles must be placed adjacent to Charisma).

It's extremely tactical and not to be taken seriously, but very enjoyable.

A clever little tile laying game with some neat choices. I gather this was a pre-production copy and it really looks it; bland artwork and thin tiles.

With a full production makeover, this could be a really pretty game, to join the fact that it's a really clever little game.

A small two-player gem. Fast & furious, creates sudden interstitial moments to grab before they collapse. I don't normally take to programming moves, but this one is somehow seeable.

*

A distillation of special powers into simple positional states, it has that same exuberance & grinning personality that Carl Chudyk brings to his games, though with simpler and immediately intuitive mechanics and the quick tempo of lay-a-tile, pass-the-bag. Each tile has a unique affect, and the power of that tile to influence the game is defined by it's context... when it comes out of the bag and where it's placed slides meaning and value around in a delightful way that begs another quick play.

The naming of the tiles has a wit to them that shadows a minimal thematic latching with such deftness I shook my head with appreciation as the game unfolded.

The look ahead mechanic for the tiles you can choose, and the simplicity of adding a point to the new tile added each turn, heighten the tile choice with turn-order type shenanigans as you pass (hopefully) devilish decisions to your partner. It suits the LoFi (Low Overhead, Full Interaction) movement's goals with charm, the [i]why[/i] questions of a move fill your mind without churn and there are no [i]how[/i] questions, surprise comes out of the bag. 

A perfect pub or cafe game, easy to throw into the backpack too.

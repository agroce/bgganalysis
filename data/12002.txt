A very good two player game. Satisfying theme. Whatever strategies you try it's almost always close and there is a great deal of interesting variety in the game play. Just enough player interaction to keep things very competitive (though more would be better). Would be higher if it wasn't for the weapons card.

Lots of tough decisions to make with the cards (which are very high quality in design), but with most card games, luck of the draw is a factor.  Definitely a strategy game despite this aspect, ala San Juan, with an original feel to it.  Solid theme, interesting gameplay makes me wish the game could accomodate more than 2 players.

The game was fine but I don't know yet. I don't like all the uncertainty from the luck of the draw... all the animals and people cards coming out really make it difficult to plan well. And where's the economic aspect I heard so much about? Storing some junk for a while and then selling it is not incredibly interesting. I've only played one game, which I've won. I'll try another game or two, but right now I'm not sure how it'll stand up over time. I've heard that removing the animal and people cards that you don't like helps the game, but I'm not sure it's worth going to the trouble. Time will tell.

Good game. Really enjoy it. One of 3 games I took away for a week on a houseboat, and got plenty of plays in that week, but sadly none since. I need another holiday, and would gladly take this game along, again.

While I also took the 2 expansions along, in a solid week of playing, Annette and I never felt like breaking them out. The base game is good as it is.

It is very cutthroat with the animal cards, but I still really like this one. It *might* have a run away leader problem and it certainly is entangled with card flows - i.e. if you get the cards, you win. If not, you will not. This is not to say there isn't any skill here because I believe there certainly is. But the form it takes is risk estimatation - in drawing more cards, in keeping certain combinations. Still, I like it quite a bit.

RATING: 6
I can't find anything wrong with Jambo. On the other hand, there's nothing in it that struck me as ingenious. 

Every turn you are optimizing your hand to reach the goal before your opponent. Thus the game is very tactical. The strategy part comes after several plays when you are familiar enough with the cards allowing you to build the type of engine you want. With the engine I am referreing to the three utility cards you can have as permanents. Nevertheless, the game is mostly tactical despite the utility cards.

For a such a light game, the gameplay leans heavily on text. Hence, cannot be played with someone who cannot read or does not know the language.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not bad game, but not as good as I hoped it would be.  An easy to play, light sort of game with yet plenty of strategy. It does take rather a long time compared to some 2 player games, but I'm sure that I'll keep on enjoying this for many years to come and my rating may well go up with more plays.

+ The items can give you neat abilities and help you speed up the buying and selling process; Interesting animal/attack cards.
- Kinda boring; I don't really enjoy the buying and selling of goods in this context.


Why it's previously-owned:
There's nothing about this game that set it apart as either being creative, unique, or fun.  It was decent, but nothing stood out.
This got traded as part of a large online trade.

RATING: 10
[With BOTH expansions -- which is CRITICAL for maximum Jambo playing]

We don't like San Juan at all.  We [i]really[/i] like this.  It feels less luck-driven than San Juan, and the market mechanism works quite well.  Fun, takes longer than most people seem to claim, and is always enjoyable (and usually a close game -- nice for me, since I'm usually the loser when we play... anything).  Lots more variation than you'd think at first, too -- some games you never see small markets, some games you get great utilities and weak animal/people cards.  Some are croc-fests, some are not.  The simple buy/sell "euro" works surprisingly well with the CCG aspect.

Glory to Rome is more exciting.  But it frustrates and disappoints, sometimes, and the learning curve/relearn cost is high, while Jambo just delivers, every game, faithfully.

UPDATE:  at least for now knocking Jambo down a hair:  still a fine game, and if you add up scores, over time the stronger player will win.  But there is a bit more luck than I'd like, now that we've learned to conserve actions better -- I want some (otherwise my wife always wins), but it sometimes feels "unfair" in an irritating way.

This emerges, I think, when you realize that taking the free gold is often a good move.  If that 4th (or 4th + 5th) move is marginal, don't do it!  The gold piles up fast, making endgame come sooner.  Then you can't "wait for a super turn" and may go over 60 quicker to strike before they can get a super-turn.  Which means a decent chance of going out when you "should" then losing when a series of great wares fall into the opponent's lap.  I've been on the winning side of this lately, but it still lowers Jambo's appeal to a fun but rather luckish card game.

UPDATE:  Play with both expansions, and "stalled" games seem way less frequent (none in 6 plays) and the skill-vs-luck balance seems back in the right spot.  Maybe a 10 with both expansions (and some huts, at least store, but not relics -- haven't tried carpets yet).  All huts + carpets is fun, too.  Way to go Rudiger!

A clever little card game with simple yet well-balanced mechanics. The art is beautiful, but the game can be brutal: the "take that" cards are surprisingly nasty, and don't fit the theme very well. Also, you can spend a long time waiting for a specific card, which can lead to boring moments (kinda like when you play Catan and wait for your lucky number to show up on the dice).

Pretty fun, and quick. Indeed, there seems to be quite a bit of luck in the draw, especially when searching for the right ware cards. Having something that allows you to pick your specific wares seems very helpful, and then there are a lot of people / animal cards that just don't seem useful enough to keep. Still, fast enough and seemingly tight enough to be enjoyable.

The combination of Rudiger Dorn and resource management had me wary of this game; I loath the same designer's Goa.  And yet there are some nice elements here.  As others have commented, Jambo is reminiscent of CCGs in the way that you search for effective card combinations and churn through the deck looking for the right card.  The character and animal cards help prevent Jambo from becoming a tiresome efficiency exercise.  The cards are handsome too. And it plays in about a third of the time of Goa.  What's not to like?

Nice trading game in the heart of Africa. Its a 2 players only game, easy to teach and play. Players have 5 actions on their turn. You can use these actions to draw more cards, buy or sell wares and play cards from your hand. There are some animal cards that you can use to mess with your opponent and make the game more interactive. I like the artwork on most cards. The game offers enough choices and replayability.

Another fantastic Kosmos title featuring a lot of aspects I look for in 2 player games.  Is really easy to play and teach, but presents players with a lot of choices about how to go about each turn.  The components all work really well, although I do wish the action markers were double sided.  Features one of my favorite things in gaming, in that you're given a variety of cards that can do a lot of different tricks.  You have utensils which give some more permanent aid, animals to hurt your opponents and people cards you can use to further aid your endeavors.  Plays around 30 minutes and is further supported through two other expansions.

Bought this one a bit of a whim. Players are rival East African merchants, trying to get the most money buying and selling various good from ware cards to and from their stalls. On each of their turns they have five actions (indicted by a shield token) to draw and play cards, including a variety of special cards that have a single use (people), persistent one-per-turn action (utilities) or attack the opponent (animal).

I like it. Nice short trading and card comboing game. The only potential problem seems to be that players could be left in the dust. Probably would want to get the expansions, if I could find them.

Great 2 player game, but hard to give a single rating to. When it's good (ie, you get some decent cards) it's very, very good. Sometimes a long dry spell sets in, though, and you just have to sit there and take it. I've heard the Expansion helps with this; if it does, my rating will be going up!

Nice game, plays well and quickly.  Getting the opponent to monitor the five turns with the turn counters is an excellent idea.  Slight concern that the distribution of the small markets could upset the balance of the game where one player receives all or most of these cards.  Suggest that each player must discard a small market of they do not but it and the opponent allowed to buy it at the higher cost of 6 or maybe more.

Jambo is a pretty quick game, that packs in a pretty good amount of fairly familiar card-play in a neat little package.  The pacing of Jambo is pretty laid back, the game never really feels too tense to me.

The economic aspects of Jambo are actually pretty tight.  It's not going to rival the giants like Power Grid, or trading games like Genoa, but it delivers a pretty solid game in a small package.

Its a good change of pace from other 2-player games like Battleline.

Kicsit csalódás volt, egyrészt mert agyon volt magasztalva, másrészt mert a Goát szeretem:)
A játék túl monoton nekem, és baromi hosszú!! Szerintem több, mint egy óra volt. És mindezt úgy, hogy 2-3 pénzenként araszolgattunk körönként, a kezdeti 20 pénzemhez kb. egy óra alatt csináltam még 18 pénzt (magam sem értem, mire ment el, de a sok kereskedés ellenére is úgy éreztem, egy helyben topogok), aztán jött egy szuper lap, a Portugal nevű, amivel kb. 15 másodperc alatt szereztem 22 pontot!!!! (eladtam 11 árut egyszerre), és megnyertem a teljesen veszett partit (60-60 lett). Lehet, hogy csak oltári nagy szerencsém volt, hogy tele voltam hellyel (6+3+3+3 helyem volt), és épp sok árum volt, és akkor húztam ezt a lapot (amiről nem is tudtam, hogy létezik, mivel az első játékom volt), de akkor is túl erősnek érzem...

Röviden: nem rossz, de kategóriához képest HOSSZÚ (És ugye inkább egy Goa, mint 2 Jambo parti:). Ráadásul nyelvfüggő is:)

Pretty cool card game.  I like it quite a bit and so does my wife.  The rules are very simple and easy to grasp.  Reading the cards reminded me of my MtG days.  I kept thinking of combos  and how all the utility cards were engines that would design with MtG.  I am already hoping that there is an expansion for the game for cooler effects.  This is a nice step up from Battle Line in depth.  Right now I have Lost Cities -> Baattle Line -> Jambo for complexity/depth ladder.

Played twice now.  While there's a bit of luck in getting the small marketplaces, that _might_ be the only low point to the game.  We haven't uncovered anything overly powerful yet (except _maybe_ the Portuguese) and I'm going to hold off giving a rating until we've played a couple more times.  Wavering between a 6 and a 7 right now, but who knows.

Out of Print (OOP).

The key difference is the management of the wares. Since there are only 6 slots, you need to trade efficiently. So the Jambo cards proved to be challenging since we had to work with small wares space. Lost to my wife in the end.

Initial Impression: There's more than meets the eye to this little card game. Although it comes across that your only resources are gold and the trade goods, the cards in your hand represent an important resource as well. With repeated plays, card combinations become more apparent. I need to play more of this game in order to see the benefits of the direct interaction cards.

This is easily my favourite two player game.  If I have made this comment on another game, please disregard as this is my new champion!

I never played CCG's and while I realize that this isn't one, it is supposed to have some of the elements of one.  I like what I have seen thus far!

A little bit of hand management, action point, resource management and money management roll into this game.  I haven't been able to figure out the deeper strategies yet, in fact I have yet to even use all of the different cards.  But, I have enjoyed my games thus far, it is a great deal deeper than what I am used to for two player (ie. Lost Cities, Cribbage, Battle Line) and not as long or tiresome as others (Settlers of Catan Card Game).

[i]Posted: 5/7/09, Rated: 9[/i]

[i]Jambo[/i] has been on my radar for several years, but I never got around to picking up a copy.  The theme didn't really appeal to me.  And as much as I love [i][thing=9216]Goa[/thing][/i], I had yet to decide that I was a fan of [person=381]Rüdiger Dorn[/person].

Then came [i][thing=25643]Arkadia[/thing][/i].  And [i][thing=37907]Diamonds Club[/thing][/i].  And wasn't [i][thing=13642]Louis XIV[/thing][/i] one of his, too?  Okay, I am a fan.  It was finally time to pick up a copy of [i]Jambo[/i].

I shouldn't have waited this long.  [i]Jambo[/i] is a great game.  It's just complex enough to be thoroughly enjoyable, without being unapproachable for my family and friends.  It's designed to be a two player game, which I consider to be a bonus: I prefer games that have been designed for two players, rather than ones which require rules adjustments or a variation to accommodate that number.  Sure, the corollary is that [i]Jambo[/i] won't scale, but that's okay.  As part of the [family=78]Kosmos two-player series[/family], I don't expect it to do so.  So why do I have any regrets?  Two reasons, and neither of them are the result of any flaws in the actual game.

The first has to do with "the cult of the new" here on BGG.  The early adopters.  This phenomenon is not unique to this site.  I was very familiar with it when I was playing computer games online: the mad rush to be playing the latest and greatest titles, with a core group of players jumping from one to the next.  As my discretionary time dwindled, I found it harder and harder to keep up, and eventually lost the desire to even try.  I was glad to find a hobby in board games that wasn't so fickle that I could share with my family.  Only one of those first impressions turned out to be accurate: I can share board games with my family.

The rush to acquire, play, analzye, and ultimately discard games is still very prevalent here on the 'Geek, and I feel like I missed the boat on [i]Jambo[/i].  Many of the forum threads are already three years old, and are lying fallow.  I need to reset my own expectations on this score.

My other regret has to do with the principle mechanic of "power cards."  I'm not sure what to call it, exactly, but that whole concept of playing cards with abilities in combination, à la [i][thing=463]Magic: The Gathering[/thing][/i].  It's the hip, new mechanic being used everywhere.  [i]Jambo's[/i] sibling in the Kosmos line, [i][thing=9446]Blue Moon[/thing][/i] uses it.  [i][thing=31260]Agricola[/thing][/i] incorporates this mechanic.  [i][thing=35677]Le Havre[/thing][/i].  [i][thing=28143]Race for the Galaxy[/thing][/i].  [i][thing=36218]Dominion[/thing][/i].  I'm not saying that these games are all identical, because each one obviously has its own flavor and personality.  However, they all share this same "power card" mechanic which is starting to feel tired.

The fun these games offer is found in the discovery of effective strategies and card combinations.  Jambo definitely delivers on this front.  It's tempting to hold on to too many cards waiting for the "perfect storm" of a combination, but the People and Animal cards will thwart your plans.  The resource management aspect in the form of "wares" is a nice change, adding a dash of complexity with its variety.  The pacing feels just right, and the end game culminates in a tense manner.  [i]Jambo[/i] is a very tight, and well-conceived game.

These games also beg for expansions, and [i]Jambo[/i] is no exception.  With [thing=29510]one already released[/thing] and [thing=46127]another on the way[/thing], there is plenty of replayability to be had.  I am eagerly looking forward to all of them, even if I am arriving a few years late to the dance.

Every time I wrap this game up after a session, I tell myself that I really enjoyed the game and am surprised that I did. I figured it would get dry after awhile (stand after stand after stand of wares - trade in/trade out), but I seem to find new combinations to play around with, and set new goals (whether it helps me win or not - just a note that sometimes I play just to figure out new ideas, rather than just trying to win).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This card game simulates fairly abstract competitive commodity trading to and from a general supply. It uses a whole series of special cards that can break the basic buy-and-sell mechanisms, which enables both traders to manipulate the trading environment to their advantage, with one-off events and through the introduction of gadgets that can be used turn after turn, and which allow the owner to perform specific actions that the basic mechanism don't provide for. A tight Action Point allowance restrict players in their activities each turn.

Jambo confirms my suspicion that Magic and other CCG giants have raised my bar for enjoyable creative card interactivity so high that perfectly wonderful games that put a similar sounding engine underneath the bonnet, only end up frustrating me that you can't do more.

Keep in mind that I still see this as undeniably one of the better "normal" ones out there. The fairly limited pool of special action cards still creates a rich tapestry of alternative approaches, but with the one caveat that the approach that will work for you, depends less on your strategic intentions, and far more on what the communal draw deck spits out at you and your opponent. All cards have a function that will come in useful in certain circumstances. All cards will also prove to be utter rubbish if the cards that go well with it just don't show up. The designer has worked in a great way to allow player's to avoid the usual draw-and-get-stuffed-with-it mechanism, by allowing players to keep digging for a better cards at the cost of Action Points. Which, unfortunately, all too often means digging for cards with commodities on it.

I do have one complaint about the Commodity cards: they are too formulaic for my liking. They work well and I can see why they are set up this way, but it would have been nice to see different set combinations, especially on the cards that have 6 goods on them. Now, far too often, players simply buy and sell after getting two identical cards. Quick instant  profit, rather than facing an intricate rearranging of wares on the stalls. I would welcome brisker use of table space, now there seem to be a few disincentives too many for that. Which is a shame, as the game will probably shine brightest when players make intense use of all their interaction cards, rather than end up digging for the appropriate one for that situation. Notoriously threadbare stands don't encourage that type of play. Making Commodity cards less instantly compatible would force far more wares to the tables between turns, and would encourage players to be more creative as there is more in play to toy around with. I suspect that it would also trigger a few more occasions when one player indeed has a far superior run of the cards, but that would be a trade-off I would be happy to pay. I suspect Magic has made me almost immune to getting annoyed over those statistical blips.

The endgame hides an additional sting in the tail, as your opponent has one turn to match or better your score after you crossed the finish line. So you need to make sure that you can create a gap big enough to survive one firebrand sale on the other stall. It complicates the decision to cash in your last goods, and for a gamer that is a the type of dilemma we play for.

Had the commodity supply and demand been a bit more varied, I would be tempted to bring this out far more often, I think. As it stands, I find that Jambo wants to be a smorgasbord full of possible card variations, but looks far too quickly like plodding along fairly familiar paths. Slowly. It is solid, looks good, and it is well balanced, remarkably so even. But ultimately it lacks additional layers of niftiness that it kinda aspires to, but annoyingly won't let me rise to. It is a good game, and I am happy it finds so many welcoming game tables. It probably deserves that, but it doesn't grab me. Blame it on Magic.

Jambo is all about buying and selling wares, as many as you can, faster and more frequently than your opponent. Some cards can be used to build sweet combos for your own gain, and some will screw over the other guy. Players draw from a common deck, so there is some element of "the luck of the draw" but clever use of your turn's actions can mitigate it.

If I were to make a complaint it would simply be that I don't get enough opportunities for 2-player games, so playing good games like this becomes a challenge.  The components are good quality and the art is great.  I would recommend this for anyone who enjoys strategic 2-player games.

You know what my wife and I thought of this after we were done playing it?  Uno.  Yeah, there's a whole bunch of cards that you can form a strategy with, but they're not in your hand.  We felt that you mostly had to go with what you drew, and so in essense you were just draw and play, ala Uno.

While it has a great theme and artwork, I and my friends who played Jambo with me have felt it was very 'meh'.  Maybe it was the action points.  Maybe it was the sameness of every turn, or the inability to do much planning ahead.  Maybe the expansions add enough to the game to make it worthwhile?

Great game for two! Played it three times now, and it is getting better for each play. As long as you don't mind reading cards (which can contain quite a lot of text), this game is for anyone who wants a good two player game. And the cards are beautiful!

A little bland and repetitive, but still a solid effort from Dorn.  If the game were only 30 minutes this would probably be a 9.  As it is, the game starts to grate a little because a player's infrastructure grows haltingly at first and then proceeds too long in the period after it is assembled.  Despite the inherent variability afforded by a design centered on cards with special abilities, Jambo really doesn't harness it effectively.

RATING: 7
Pretty nice little card game where the luck of the draw is balanced by the myriad tactics available from different card combinations.  Occasionally, you'll still have a blowout game where one side just draws garbage the whole time.  It would be nice if that side weren't always mine.

First impression was good but maybe it's a typical example of "OK and what?". Left me cold and probably it's not an appealing theme for my wife... so this is not a candidate for my collection even I have liked quite a bit my only play until now.

After second play more than 2 years later, I reconsider my initial rating and raise it a little bit, this game is fun and very good when you only have one partner.

The mix of cards seems off... many attack cards but little worth attacking... very few extra market stalls but you need them for the extra space required to buy and sell (unless you get lucky and find identical ware cards).

This is one of those games that I can't even put into words the reason I like it, but like it I do.  I will say that it takes a couple of plays before you really start to see how the game is operating.  The expansions are a great addition, but be warned, expansion 1 on its own has issues.  Combined with expansion 2 though, you'll have a huge card game that is quite fun IMO.

From the same guy who designed Traders of Genoa, Goa and Louis XIV... this is a two player masterpiece to cap off some very impressive multi-players. Great, quick and satisfying resource management game! I dont anticipate getting bored with this gem.

Really cool 2p Kosmos game which is basically about buying and selling goods for a profit.  What really makes the game cool are all the people/animal/utility cards which add a lot of variety to the game and make it a little different each time.  The game is a little heavier and longer than you might expect if your thinking this will be like Lost Cities or something like that, although this is still a light and pretty fast game.  It's takes some plays to get to know the cards but they're pretty simple, for the most part, and once you know them the game really moves along.

1 play.  Overall reaction was "meh".  Not great, not terrible.  But when you're done, not much to say either - no stirring victory or crushing defeat that makes you want a rematch.  Just, "well, let's put that away and do something else".  I'll probably give it one or 2 more chances before trading.

De momento, es pronto para dar un voto definitivo. Sólo he asistido a la explicación de las reglas y jugado un turno. Se trata de un juego comercial ambientado en la Africa profunda. El jugador tiene dos opciones: robar o jugar carta, y puede realizar cinco acciones en cada turno. Algunas cartas te permiten comerciar con mercancías...  que pasan a estar en tu mercado. El mercado tiene capacidad finita (6 posiciones), aunque pueden comprarse otros mercados menores (Con tres posiciones). Curioso el tema del comercio, porque se utilizan las mismas cartas (se compran a un precio y se venden a otro), pero al comprar, te descartas de la carta, por lo que la venta no es trivial.

Tiene buena pinta. Matizaré mi voto cuando haya jugado alguna partida completa.

I've tried this twice, both against the same opponent, and both times the games were blowouts (one for him, one for me).  The cards seemed to vary a lot in power, so not only did it seem like the game was decided mostly by card draw, but the decisions seemed obvious.

Enjoy this game even more than Jaipur. The mechanics are little more "complex" and provide a bit more opportunity for strategy. The theme is fantastic, just like Jaipur.

Nicely done. This turns out to be a decent hand management game. Lots of play options with the different people and animal cards. The cards seem to offer too many things at first, so a couple of plays is needed before proper evaluation. Overall, good planning with timely sale of goods is essential to achieving the 60 point total for victory. UPDATE: Need to be familiar with the people and animal cards to get that edge over less experienced opponents, but when both players have this, can be an exciting, close game.

Sometimes a bit long, and sometimes the cards just cycle through repetatively, but overall fun and solid.  I like the end-game rule; really forces the players to think if they want to go out and risk losing by the opponent tying.  Very satisfying to pull of a great combo, but a bummer when your opponent sets up a card- or ware-generating machine and you don't have any cards to counter; you just watch them pull away.

Jambo is my least favorite Dorn design thus far.  I'm sure you need to play it often to get the full benefit, but I happened to get this one at the same time as other games that are similar but better (Dominion for the drafting, Loyang for the trading).

I like it enough, but don't know how much I'd choose this over other games. The people/animal cards are random and arbitrary (and sometimes mean) and some of the utility cards are WAY more powerful than others. On the other hand, the game is challenging enough to hold my interest and each play is different enough that I can see myself requesting this more often with further experience.

I like the basic mechanic of buying commodities to sell them for a profit, but the power cards are unbalanced and can create a situation where one player pulls ahead and is unstoppable, especially since they are shuffled in with the commodity cards and you only get to draw one card per round (unless you have some of the aforementioned unbalanced power cards).  Not impressed.

This game just feels purely content driven to me. There are plenty of card games that rely on combo-building cards based on random draws, but often they have other, more important mechanics that are the driving force for the strategy behind the game (deckbuilders are about... well, building your deck and tableau games usually have some kind of economic or role selection [RfG, San Juan]) - this just feels like all you're doing is drawing a card and hoping it's useful. The economic game here just feels too straightforward to be interesting.

A good card game for 2 players which isn't quite as quick as many other card games (it usually takes at least half an hour). I like it, but it's not a game I would always choose to play as I like actual board games with a board more, so would probably rather play a euro game which works well with 2 players. Nevertheless, I still enjoy it when I play it and the animal cards offer "take that" moments which I like! Will try it again with the expansions to see if it's better.

Jambo is another solid two-player-only game focused around a deck of cards. I first played this after playing numerous games of Lost Cities and Jaipur with my wife. All three are solid games, and if I don't buy this one, it's only because I already own the other two.

Of the three, Jambo probably offers the best sense of "making a buck," via buying and selling goods. It also has probably the most complexity and length of the three, so it's on the cusp of that "quick filler." It's the only one that has written powers and effects on the cards, but it's nothing too complex to manage. Solid game.

RATING: 8
This is probably one of the best 2-player games I've played (admittedly, I haven't played many!).  It's a trading game that involves buying and selling resources and playing special cards to help at said goal.  The cards are well-written so that little rulebook consultation is needed; even on a first play, the cards are pretty much self-explanatory despite their variety.  This game feels very well-put together and clean, and it has more depth than many mid-length 2-player games.

This is an enjoyable game with very nice card art.  Although there is alot of text on the cards, the game is not overly complicated to learn.  We like the fact that you can keep trying to draw a card that helps you, at the expense of how much you can do during the rest of your turn.  It strikes a nice balance between hoping for a lucky draw and making the best out of what you got.

After one play, I liked this game okay. Gave it a 6. I can see it moving up with more plays. But it probably won't go much higher than a 7.

Update after 3: I thought it would go up. Actually, it goes down. I like good interaction, but the animal cards annoy me. My wife and I almost never use them. Besides that, the game feels more like a race than an economic game. If I want a light race game, I'd rather play Odin's Ravens.

Traded to Pete for Hellas.

A top-merchant buy low, sell high card driven game in which each player is trying to profit the most, gaining gold in order to win the game.

There's a lot of ebb and flow to the game. Card drawing is very random and it can be a while before you get your engine going. You can save up for a big payout or take what comes and chip away at victory.

The big twist is the CCG-like mechanics of the utility cards in which you can tap to give yourself one-time abilities each turn.

Big hit with the wife. Unfortunately, I find it "just ok", possibly due to the rather dull theme and artwork. I think this would work way better if there was a funner theme. Regardless, it's a good game.

RATING: 8
Fun light game of buying and selling goods, with an element of "take that" thrown in.  The tension in gathering ware cards looking for good combinations makes for a fun game.  There's also an element of doing the best with what you have.  There is a good amount of luck, but it can be offset by familiarity with the cards as well as skilled play.

Played only a few times so far.

Very strong candidate of play. Stands up on its own two feet very easily. Some of the item cards have weird effects and don't make sense thematically, but that is the only criticism I can think of within the game boundaries. The buy to sell to buy mechanic is very well put together and it is easy to tell just how thoroughly it has been tested.

Fun little game with quite a few things to explore because of all the special and utility cards. Fairly CCG like in its play, not as variable of course, but still nifty. Essentially an economic game where you use special powers to break some aspect of the game and then try to take advantage. Ultimately has dropped from 7 to a 6 for me just because there is only so much to explore here. It feels CCG-like enough to make me compare it to those types of card games, and in comparison the discovery period is just altogether too short.

RATING: 7
This is a fantastic game, definitely one of the better of the Kosmos 2-player series.  There's a nice degree of depth, the luck typical of card games is mitigated by a few mechanics and special cards, and it's refreshing to see a trading game specifically for two.  Thematically, the game fits with the mechanics well, and it's a _fun_ theme.    The special cards are well-thought out and provide for some interesting interplay such as limited auctions and forced trading.  Sure, not every card is useful 100% of the time but there are also cards that let you discard for various effects and the phase 1 draw affords you the option to keep drawing as long as you have actions.  Overall, a mechanically interesting and superlative game that certainly doesn't deserve some of the negative comments I've seen directed at it.

RATING: 7
This is a good 2 player economic game.  I like that the box is small and that there is very little set up time.  Players take turns taking five action to draw a card, play a card, or use the cards they've played.  There are utility cards that give you a power to use once each turn, animal cards that allow you to attack the other player, person cards that can provide you with help, 5 small market cards to have space for extra goods, and finally, supply cards that allow you to buy and sell goods.  The goal is to buy and sell enough goods to have the most gold at the end of the game.  Game end is triggered by a player ending their turn with 60 gold pieces.  The other player takes one more turn.  If other player ties or exceeds the triggering players gold, they win.

RATING: 3
I started out enthusiastically, but after having played about one third through, I decided that enough was enough. The advertised smart selling and buying of goods is, in fact, an annoying Hellas-esque tug of war where the only smart input required from the players is creating useful combos from cards drawn at random. Cards which allow you to, for example, start a mini-auction, discard opponent's items, exchange items, draw new cards, and so forth. I really cannot be bothered at all to learn all the various abilities and options and combinations and tricks introduced by such a mechanic, and then the game sinks deep into pointlesness. I shall not play this game again; in fact, I shall strive hard to sell it off as soon as possible.

[b]Update[/b] 'Soon' proved to be a relative term, but someone was willing to relieve me of this burden.

I love the art on the cards.

I enjoy the gameplay.

True it is a little lucky sometimes. I don't mind that too much. It is a fast game. It is very straight forward.

I get that fantasy of having and owning and using my equipment cards. It feels like a video game that I would want to play. 

Blue Moon felt like a video game that annoyed me.

There seems to be some similar mmo or a-rpg like aspects of loot and inventory management in this. There is the absolute joy of "owning" fantasy goods, that can do things for you.

I'd laugh at the suggestion of selling it. Ever. It would probably be on up there on the scale of the most genuine, boisterous laugh you could get out of me.

I own the expansions and Asante.

I paid maybe 30 bucks for Jambo and the expansions because I bought it when it was in print. +40 to 45 in value in 4 years huh?

RATING: 3
Components: Pleasant illustrations on the people, animal, and utility cards. Functional illustrations of the goods. Perhaps in an effort to forgo any additional FAQ in the rules (which we still needed), the text-based cards are especially wordy, to the point of being difficult to quickly understand, which is important for the flow of the game, since we are often flipping cards and needing to decide whether to keep the cards or not.

The text on the back of the box is laughable. “Friendly greeting”? This game is anything but friendly. And “Return to the dark continent”?

Experience: Wow, not my kind of game. On the one hand, this is a game of careful money management, where I invest gold to buy resources, hoping to sell them later at a profit. But all the special action cards just trash my sense of strategy and satisfaction. My wares can be stolen or swapped; my cards can be destroyed or negated. It didn't seem to matter how carefully I planned something, because my opponent could just throw some card in my face to scramble my best laid plans. And having an extra stall in my opening hand is a huge advantage.

Initially I didn't think I'd like this game, based on reading its description. But many comments and reviews nudged me to try it. I'm not sorry I tried it, but my initial reaction was the right one: I don't enjoy it.

I can't say I've been a fan of most of Rüdiger Dorn's games, but this is definitely my least favorite.

It's an economic game with special action cards.  Buy low, sell high, sure, but you have a lot of special cards (things, people, animals) to make the job easier for you and/or harder for your opponent.

A very nice resource management game that seems to work better to play more immediate and not plan so far ahead.

Jambo is tough to rate, because what makes it better than most card games is also what makes it a bit worse. It's almost a step towards a board game. It's a very interesting game with a lot of fun trading, decision making, and resource manipulation/economics. The sheer number of different action cards adds variety but it just might be a little much, which is why I sometimes hesitate grabbing for it.

Nice two player card game in which you have to gather at least 60 pieces of gold in order to win the game. This is achieved by trading goods (different combinations of goods can be bought and sold according to the cards that you draw). The card deck contains a lot of persons, animals and objects that can be used as action cards. Each round a player can perform 5 actions. If he only performs 3 or less, he obtains 1 gold.

This game had way too much take that play in it for us. We also felt too restricted by the mechanism for buying and selling goods. We often felt that one of us would get lucky and draw a matching pair of market cards and do a quick buy and then sell play and that would often determine the winner. I know others like this it just is not for us.

This is a frequently recommended two-player game, but we just haven't been able to get into it. It's solid, but we have a few too many games where one player is crippled for the entire game by a lack of one type of card or another, and has very little fun as a result. I hear that the expansions improve some of this, but I'm not willing to buy an expansion to "fix" a game.

Doel van het spel:

Zodra een speler aan het einde van zijn beurt 60 of meer goudstukken bezit, krijgt zijn tegenstander nog 1 beurt. Na deze beurt wint de speler met het meeste goud. In geval van gelijkstand wint de speler die het laatst aan de beurt was. 

Voorbereiding:

+ De spelers zitten tegenover elkaar. 
+ Iedere speler ontvangt één groot marktkraam en een startkapitaal ter waarde van 20 goudstukken. 
+ Schud alle overgebleven speelkaarten en iedere speler trekt 5 handkaarten. 
+ Kies een startspeler. 

Speelverloop:
 
De spelers spelen volgens beurtvolgorde, beginnend bij de startspeler. In iedere beurt heeft de speler 5 acties ter beschikking en voert hij de volgende 2 fasen in volgorde uit: 

1/ Kaarten trekken (niet verplicht) 

De speler trekt de bovenste kaart van de trekstapel en besluit of hij de kaart wil houden of niet. 

+ Houdt hij de kaart, dan gaat hij direct naar fase 2.
+ Legt hij de kaart af, dan mag hij een volgende kaart trekken OF naar fase 2 gaan. 

Per beurt mag de speler maar 1 kaart houden. Iedere kaart dat een speler trekt, kost 1 actie. 

2/ Kaarten spelen 

Het uitspelen van een kaart kost 1 actie (tenzij het anders staat vermeld op de kaart). Er zijn 5 verschillende soorten kaarten: 

+ Kleine marktkramen: Leg deze kaart naast jouw grote markt. Deze blijft liggen tot het einde van het spel. De eerste speler die een klein marktkraam bouwt, betaalt 6 goudstukken. Alle volgende kleine marktkramen kosten maar 3 goudstukken (ook voor de tegenspeler). 

+ Goederenkaarten: Met deze kaart kan je handelsgoederen kopen of verkopen. 

Bij het kopen, betaalt de speler het aantal goudstukken (linksonder) en legt hij de desbetreffende goederen op vrije velden van zijn marktkramen. De kaart wordt afgelegd. Heeft de speler niet genoeg vrije velden OF ontbreekt een betreffende goed, dan mag hij de goederen niet kopen. 

Bij het verkopen krijgt de speler het aantal goudstukken (rechtsonder) en legt hij de desbetreffende goederen uit zijn marktkramen terug in de voorraad. Alle afgebeelde goederen en de kaart moeten afgelegd worden! 

+ Voorwerpen: Deze kaart komt open voor de speler te liggen en hij kan direct gebruik maken van de functie van het voorwerp. Ieder voorwerp kan per beurt maar 1 keer gebruikt worden en een speler kan niet meer dan 3 voorwerpen voor zich hebben liggen. Speelt de speler een 4de voorwerp uit dan moet hij een openliggende kaart afleggen. 

+ Personen: Voer de desbetreffende actie van de kaart uit en leg ze vervolgens af. 

+ Dieren: Voer de desbetreffende actie van de kaart uit en leg ze vervolgens af. De tegenspeler kan buiten zijn beurt een wachter afleggen om zich tegen de gespeelde dierenkaart te beschermen. 

Als een speler aan het einde van zijn beurt nog 2 of meer acties over heeft, dan krijgt hij 1 goudstuk uit de bank.
Belangrijke regels:  

+ Het is toegestaan om al jouw 5 acties te gebruiken voor het trekken van een kaart in fase 1. 
+ Een speler mag ook fase 1 overslaan en zijn beurt direct beginnen met fase 2. 
+ Als een handelsgoed op het 6de vakje van jouw groot marktkraam geplaatst wordt, dan kost jou dat direct 2 goudstukken. Dit bedrag moet je, in geval van gebruiken, iedere keer opnieuw betalen. 
+ Als een speler niet genoeg plaats heeft op zijn marktkramen voor handelsgoederen die hij verkregen heeft bij het uitspelen van personen of dieren, dan mag hij kiezen welke hij op zijn marktkramen legt en welke in de voorraad blijven of daar naar toe gaan. 
+ De tegenspeler houdt met de actie fiches het aantal uitgevoerde acties bij. Voor iedere uitgevoerde actie neemt hij een fiche. Aan het einde van de beurt legt hij de fiches terug in het midden.

I bought Jambo as a first step into the world of CCGs. When I started playing it, I did like the available card combos within the starting deck and I enjoyed my first few games. Now that I've tried other CCGs, my desire to play Jambo has dropped. It's not a bad game and I can play it with my girlfriend, always a big plus, but overall it doesn't provide the same tension that other CCGs provide. Sure, Jambo is not half as complicated as they are, but everytime I play it, I wish I would be playing Warhammer Invasion instead.

A final note: I still have to try Jambo with the two expansions. I read that they make the game much better.

Very fun two player game with interaction. I doubt there is a better two player trading game and probably the best Kosmos two player game in my opinion. The only downside is without expansions it feels like taking the extra gold for not using two of your actions is mandatory to win.

Rating is after one play (thanks, Roger).  I think I started getting a little of the strategic element after it was too late.  Maybe should try again.  But for such a light game there was a lot of downtime to read all the cards (and all the opponent's cards).

RATING: 4
This is based upon my initial impression.  I would have to play it a few more times before it could make it higher (or lower).  To start off with, it seemed like too many rules for what I got.  Also, I pretty much only play 2 player games with my wife.  She would never stand for all of the rules.

Quite surprisingly short and interesting 2 player game.

Good to do 2 of 3, and such with good interest.

Tactics and strategy develop frankly with the more games you play. Interesting strategies can be developped while players race to win the game.

Nice components and welle balanced also.

Neat little game with some interesting combos to build up in the utility cards.  But theme is a little lame (Who are these people who keep selling me silver for 3 so I can sell it for 10?) and there's not much to either think about or compete over.  Starship Catan is much better for two.  Maybe if this had production rules so it could be a full economic game.  Silver mines and such.

RATING: 8
Very nice two player game, almost CCG like in feel.  Players are traders in commodities in an African village.  Each turn they get five actions to spend on either drawing cards from the common deck, looking for one to keep - then on playing the cards in their hand/on the table.  Cards can be purchase/sell "orders" cards, personalities, animals (do something to your opponent) or utilities (game lasting powers).  Nice mix and interaction with the card deck, commodities and gold.  The game ends when someone has amassed 60+ gold - highest total wins.  Very good, some nice things to think about, not too long, plays well.  Great little game.

After further plays, this is still not wowing me and I've lowered the rating. There are many dull points in the game where you can't find something useful and you're just cycling through cards.  The games are very close but the winner seems random or arbitrary. It feels similar but inferior to a game like San Juan, so I don't think this will be seeing many plays.

This game is the great 2-player cardgame I  had hoped for when I tried the Catan Card Game. Whereas the Catan cardgame tries to emulate the boardgame, this game is packed with tight economic decisions and tradeoffs. There are four currencies and various cards let you swap them under different circumstances, much like in Hansa [another of my favorite gems].

RATING: 9
I am really enjoying this game.  Maybe the best of the Kosmos 2-player line?  The card interactions are very well balanced, and the tactical play is exciting.  Very well written rules. 

UPDATE: I still like the game quite a bit, but my tolerance for luck seems to be diminishing slightly, and the cards you draw really play a big role in your success.  You can mitigate this by various means, but they all have a cost, so getting lucky definitely helps.

UPDATE UPDATE: Despite what I said above, I'm starting to believe you largely make your own luck in this game.  If you pick a strategy that doesn't match the cards you're getting, you're in trouble.  If you're flexible and willing to spend some actions drawing cards, then you can usually stay in contention no matter what you get.

Pretty neat 2-player game that has quite a few rules and bit of a learning curve because of the number of special cards.   The click system has just a hint of Netrunner in it, which I like.   Card drawing can only be used up front in the sequence, and basic money taking at the end.   I found the goods cards to be frustrating when combined with the limited storage options on the first play, but with more experience I can see where that can be better managed.   Pretty clever game.

My wife and daughter said they enjoyed this ... but I struggled with finding the fun - not sure why yet ... maybe it will grow on me.

Well, now 2009, and I have begun to enjoy this, so upped the rating

One of the best in the Kosmos 2-player line. Interesting card management that is enhanced by such a large deck. You can never count on a particular card or combination of cards to repeatedly come up, so your strategy has to change from game to game. The expansion only enhances this aspect.

After a couple of initial plays, this sat for a few years. Now that we've played Dominion a bit I reintroduced it to my wife. A very good little two-player that is intriguing enough for her to ask for again. And even though there is a fair amount of "screwage" with the card play, she seems to not take offense. Small Kosmos box travels well.

A neat little card game with decent illustrations. Collecting goods is fun, but it can be tough to have enough market stands to hold what you need to collect. The game plays quickly enough but can be a bit unlucky at times. The expansions really bump this game up a notch. Assante is basically expansion 3 and is logged with this entry.

2016-09-09 : Card combinations and a tiny bit of engine building produce a rather entertaining game with a fair number of take-that moments.

Jambo is a good two player non-collectible card game that feels somewhat like a collectible card game with the exception of both players drawing from the same deck.  You try to buy goods at a low value, and then sell them at a higher value.  There are a number of items that give you special benefits and animal cards that can be used to mess with your opponent.  There is a certain degree of luck as with any card game, but I consider it worth the price of admission.

After about 4 or 5 plays, this game becomes a lot more interesting. This is when strategies for quickly generating wares and ideas for messing with your opponent become obvious the game becomes a lot more dynamic and less dry. 

From someone who has acquired nearly all of the Kosmos two player games, I can say that this game is most likely the best of the series.  

9 to 8: There are some cards that are just worthless in the original deck. I'm hoping the expansion will breathe some life back into this game. 

Update: The expansion is essential. If you look into my collection you'll see that I generally don't purchase expansions for my games. Jambo is a glowing exception for this rule.

Interesting game.  Very simple mechanic, which makes learning how to play the game quite easy.  However, there is great diversity in the cards and possible actions, which allows for considerable depth and variety in play.  Looks like a lot of opportunity for developing strategy and tactics.  After additional plays, I may increase my rating.

Edit: I've actually decreased my rating to a 7. Maybe its because we don't play often enough to be comfortable with all the cards, but it plays longer than it should for what it is.

A nice little game with stunning artwork. The components are all solid as to be expected from the 2er Kosmos series. The game play is easy to pick up and grows in strategy as you get a better grasp of all the specialty cards available in the deck. Luck can influence the outcome, if a player doesn't get the needed mix of cards. Especially a lack of ware cards can really ruin game play.

Jambo's strength lies in the many cards that modify a basic trading system. It can be difficult to predict what your opponent might do next.

This is another game where scoring tends to progress evenly. I also appreciate the ability cards that grant access to goods/gold/cards, helping to manage the randomness of the game.

I enjoy it occasionally but find repeated play unappealing. Sorry to you, micro-review reader, because I cannot explain why!

This is a marketplace game where the players buy and sell goods to earn money, and can play various cards to increase their efficiency and mess with one another.

I found this game incredibly dull.  It should have been exciting -- there are multiple opportunities throughout for the players to mess with one another by playing devious cards to steal each other's goods or block the other player's move -- but the game mostly felt like work.  Frankly, it's skippable.

Jambo: One of those games that BBGers always seem to recommend to couples. And they're right. It's a great two-player action-point style card game with much room for exploration and smart tactical play. If you like this sort of thing, you'll probably really like this iteration of that sort of thing.

RATING: 7
Jambo is another engaging Kosmos 2-player, but with a little bit of nastiness in it.  There are definitely a number of "take that" cards that can imbalance the game if your opponent gets more of them than you. Otherwise , Jambo is a very enjoyable game and we are looking forward to more plays of this one.

(2 players) Decent number of options on a turn and games seem to be pretty close.  You must play a few games to understand what all the cards can do.  Sometimes your options seem limited based on the goods cards you draw but I guess that's an emerging part of strategy that I've yet to understand (i.e. how to get the right cards).

The basic mechanism is okay, but the game hangs heavily on the action cards. The rules text seems clear though, most being one-shot actions. The cards match the theme well, and it's all quite inventive. But I'm amazed this is rated highly, it surely will get dull quickly.  Text dependent, so get the US edition. *** Played my own copy, and whilst I enjoyed the game, it did take a while to finish, nearly 2 hours (we're not fast players). I got to 60 gold first, but Richard was on 59 so passed on his turn, got the extra gold equally my score, so he was the winner. D'OH! *** Been playing this at work a few times. My play is faster, 40 minutes including set-up, and the game still holds its interest.  I pulled cards today that I hadn't seen before. But there's no great inter-action and I'm not marking this higher than 6.

RATING: 7
Nice 2-player card game that has a "Magic: The Gathering" feel.  Instead of 20 hitpoints, players try to reach a monetary goal.  Like Magic, the cards have special abilities that become even stronger once the "combos" are discovered.  Grade: C

Played 15+ times. This truly is one of those games you must play several times in order to appreciate how much fun it can be. There is such a large mix of cards in the deck that only many plays can give a player a real sense of tactical control. Different cards drawn will bring about different approaches in tactics, and juggling money and goods to try and make every dollar count is a lot of fun! Absolutely jaw-dropping artwork.

played once. disappointing. very alluring but not very satisfying.  the main mechanism of buying and selling is neat, but it plays out rather flat.  buying wares is so expensive (opportunity cost-wise) that players are encouraged to wait until they have a complete buy/sell transaction in hand, rather than take risks with wares.  i was expecting to sell/buy with my opponent, but dealing with the bank makes the game very sterile.

Interesting interactive trading game. Cleverly designed in how everything comes together : how you use items and can steal them from each other ; that you can add shelves to have a bigger stock ; the reaction cards to counter played persons, animals and ware cards ; ... It all makes for a tense 2 player game.

RATING: 5
Nice two player card game with a CCG feel.  I'm not a big fan of 'almost' CCGs like Blue Moon, but Jambo has a little economic trading game going on that gives the game a solid feel.  Instead of just being a CCG type game, it just uses the card powers to spice up the trading part which is interesting on its own.  It's very satisfying to play and feels like a big game to me, not just a little Kosmos two player.

This is becoming quite popular with my wife as a low brainpower game.  We're beginning to get the feeling that there is a pretty decent 1st player advantage.  Most games are pretty close and the 1st player will be able to grab a couple extra gold if the 2nd player ends it.

An amazing two player game.  The theme of owning an ancient trading cart in a bazaar is well incorporated!  Many great two player games (like Lost Cities, which is tremendous) have forced themes.  In Jambo, the theme is all of it.  You have to be a shrewd trader and use your special abilities well to succeed.  A sign it's a good game:  I usually lose, but LOVE to play it anyway.

Nagyon jó, hangulatos, tematikus kétszemélyes játék. Kereskedőként kell hat féle terméket venni, és lehetőleg haszonnal eladni. Ebben segítenek minket emberek, eszközök, sőt még állatok is. A játék grafikája gyönyörű. Kártyajátékoktól nem annyira nem megszokott, nagyon jó a hangulata is a játéknak. Van valamennyi szerencse szerep, illetve a kitolás faktor igen nagy, így mindenáron győzni akaróknak valamint sértődősöknek nem ajánlott. (Ilyen szempontból a catan kártyajátékhoz tudnám hasonlítani)

------
5 játék után azt mondom, hogy annyira nem jó játék. Két bajom van vele. Hatalmas a szerencse szerepe. Ha az elején nem kapsz elég utility-t vagy a végén terméket, akkor egyszerűen esélyed sincs. Másfelől állandó probléma a játék elején a beragadás, amikor vagy nem használod ki az akcióidat, vagy mindet kártyahúzásra lövöd el, hogy kapj valami értelmes utility-t. Ez gyakran 10 körön kerersztül is fenn tud állni.

UPDATE: One of those many cards resulting in combos games ala magic - not bad, and more interaction than Dominion. rating back to 7 (14/2/14).

I was worried that in Jambo the luck factor would be high because of the random card pulls. Really, Jambo presents a nifty resource game with an engine building mechanic. There are over 100 cards, and each card only shows up about twice. Everything seems to feel balanced and the winner usually is the player who manages their cards in the best way and, of course, buys and sells the most. Jambo gets better with each play!

What a weird little game.  It seems vaguely racist and just, off somehow.  None of the mechanisms come together.  The gains are one step forward, 1/2 step back.  There's mostly these strange people and animal cards when you're trying to get the goods cards.  Each turn has 5 AP, so turns can take an abnormally long time for a two player card game.  Feels like a really old game that was a development tool for a better game. Strange.

I won't give this game any rating, cause it would be based only on solo play (me vs me) on Vassal.
Hmmm... here are my impressions:
- the game is quite a lot luck dependent (hey! it's even possible not to draw sell/buy card during the whole game at all! ok, possibility of such situation is low, but being unable to sell anything you have is still pretty possible).
- the whole system of buying and selling goods seemed rather uninspiring and fiddly.
- the cards - their effects seemed pretty much in your face (not hurting an opponent too much - you can't steal his money, but still)

Hope to play it on a convention and be able to check if my thoughts will remain or not.

A very tight and balanced resource management card game for two.  I think this one will age well and be played several times.  The luck of the draw is somewhat negated by the fact you can keeping drawing upto five cards, retaining the last.  Utility cards allow you to play up to three each round, which is very interesting.

Both my girlfriend and my favorite game. There's a heck of a lot of cards which give it a lot of variety and replay-ability. It is rich in strategy, each game we play we learn or realize something new. A bit of luck, but TONS of fun, you can get really creative with this one which has helped it get to the table dozens of times for us. We love how when one player wins (gets to 60 gold), the other player gets one more turn to try and beat or at least tie their opponent.

MAKE SURE you READ THE CARDS before you play them. A lot of times this game will end up being very close, within a few gold of each other, so every bit counts. Many cards require you to pay in some way to use them, PAY FIRST and then play.

Bought this game and the expansions to play with the wife, as suggested by many on the webpage.  The only problem was (not the fault of the game) my wife is not a native English speaker and didn't like all the reading involved initially, so there is an initial hurdle that may not have existed with a regular English speaking couple.  

Still I've played this quite a number of times and its a very excellent little tactical card game that has depth, has tension, high replayability and is quite fun.

Cards are good quality and the art is appealling. Very good.

First off, this game has very nice artwork and its setting is quite unique.  I can't help but compare this to Blue Moon since both games, I think, have a 'Magic: The Gathering' quality.  Jambo is richer in theme and is just more interesting to play than Blue Moon.  There is more variety, more interesting choices, and a nice element of money management.  The only edge that Blue Moon has is in the extra decks you can buy and the possibilities of deck-building.  For me, I am content with just Jambo.

The two things that bother me the most are the extra markets and the goods cards. Extra market stands make it much easier to fill goods cards when selling, and you can of course only buy and sell (with a couple of exceptions) by using goods cards. My issue with this is that both types of cards come by completely by random chance. You can easily not ever see an extra market stand for an entire game.

There are special cards that mitigate this, but those too are just luck of the draw.

I don't mind randomness in card games, its one of their attractions, but in this case there isn't enough else to make it really shine.

Ended up trading it off, no-one complained.

PS. Despite the frequent comments, this game has nothing at all in common with any CCG I have ever played.

As an ex-Magic player (quit ~98 and started playing board games ~04), Jambo reminds me of MtG. The various utility cards, animals and characters that alter or completely break the rules make for an entertaining game. I didn't like Jambo initially and felt luck determined the winner, but have since learned the nuances of the cards i.e. when to buy/sell/invoke utility/attack your opponent - and sound play pays off. A gem of a game.

Kinda burned out on Jambo, sold it.

A really good two player, non confrontational, hand management game. One of my wife's and mine favorite games two player only games. Has a bit of a CCG feel because of some of the card actions. Game can take a full 40 minutes or so to play. Also takes a few plays to understand / learn all the different cards and their actions, which can also slow down play.

Jambo is just plain fun, even though it's prone to spin out of the players' control at times.  It's a visually and thematically appealing game with lots of variety and plenty of opportunities for futzing around in canny ways.  Jambo is not collectible or expandable in any way, yet it definitely feels like a CCG.  Why?  It's primarily the sheer variety of cards and effects, and the way that the rules for the game are contained on the cards and in their interactions.  Another CCG-like dynamic is the way players spend a lot of the game plowing through the deck, churning as many cards as possible and looking for the ones they need the most.  Some cards are nearly always good, and others work well in conjunction with others.  Players constantly have to readjust tactically to their present situations.  The game can feel random at first because players are at the mercy of the cards they draw and because the game state can change so quickly.  With more experience, they may discover that there are usually opportunities to make their own luck.  I would especially recommend Jambo to anyone who enjoys the earlier Kosmos two-player game Babel.

Jambo is an amazing value. Great two player card game that feels like more than a card game (because of the wares and gold pieces). No game offers the same satisfaction that a 20 gold, 5 action turn in Jambo provides. Simple game about combining cards to get the most effective and efficient results. Will lose its appeal after too many plays but not before you get more than your money's worth.

It's well designed and works well, despite the many cards with special powers. However, the fact that the extra market stands are mixed in the deck, and nothing prevents them to go to only one player, feels a bit unbalancing.

Very bad game. It's mostly luck (and card) driven. Nothing you can plan or control ahead. If you draw good combinations (goods to sell/buy) you win. If you draw bad cards, you lose.

RATING: 6
Fun 2-player game of buy-low, sell-high.  First player to 60 gold causes the game to end... but the other player gets one more turn to try to equal or surpass that amount of gold.

There's obviously a lot a luck of the draw as to what cards you draw.  Ultimately, you need ware cards and small market cards to get your economy rolling.  One of the utility cards helps a lot -- the Supplies card, which allows you to draw and discard until you get a wares card.  But there are also many "attack" cards that affect the other player (like steal a ware or a utility card).  It seemed like most of the cards in my hand were always non-wares cards.

Rules are a little bit unclear: on the first turn that you play a utility card, does the playing of the card also activate the card in the same action?  We guessed that playing the card (from your hand) cost one action, and activating (turning it over and using its ability) cost another action.

An interesting 2-player game.  Player interaction is mostly limited to a few "take that" cards, but this can be remedied by swapping out those cards with cards from the expansion  :)

The utility cards and 5 actions per player keep this one moving at a good clip.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
After 50 plays, I can still say that Jambo does not overstay its welcome. While primarily a tactical game, the decisions are still meaningful while not being excruciatingly painful. An exemplary card game for two that is fun, not too heavy, while not being an exercise of running through the motions.

Furthermore, this game gets better with each and every expansion. Of particular note are the huts in Jambo Expansion 2 which turns a game of difficult decisions into one in which the difficult decisions are compounded with the sense of never having enough actions to do all the things you want to do. Accordingly, this becomes a game of making the most of it while still maintaining a flexible enough set-up to keep some momentum into the next round.

The guard hut in particular is especially brilliant as the game becomes a game of double-think with respect to peoples and animal cards -- you never know if an animal attack is played simply to have you drop your guard and have a second, bigger attack come your way, or not. Or whether the respondent might also have a guard card in their hand to respond to a second attack! Furthermore, the guard hut can be used to block a players people card which may ultimately slow down their momentum at critical moments such as the end game! Vicious indeed!

A fun and light 2-player game, Jambo combines special card powers and resource management mechanics.

The game lacks any kind of architecture in wich you could develop a strategy. All you can do is play the cards as they come, and they are uninspiring at best. Most of them are variations of the same idea (i.e. "take a ware", "exchange a ware for another", "take a ware from your oponent", etc.) and the expansions doesn't help. However, it may be okay to play with kids.

My 12 year old son really enjoys Jambo, and so do I.  The cards are very pretty and unique.  I just love the African theme and the buying and selling of goods.  It really feels like I am running a business, buying low and selling high.  What a great two player game, even though my son usually beats me.

Style: I tend to judge games at first appearance based on the artwork, and the gorgeous design of Jambo drew me in immediately. Sure, free trade in an African village is an off-beat theme, but that's also part of the unique appeal. All the components are durable, and terrifically designed. The icing on the fruitcake is the Action Tokens, which allow players to easily track their 5 moves per turn.

Substance: Been wanting to play this for a long time, and Jambo did not disappoint. This is a wonderfully complex medium-weight 2P game, which was just what I was looking for to balance out the more simplistic Lost Cities. Once you pick up the rules this can easily play in 20-30 min, but the amount of decisions and planning that fits into that time frame is quite satisfying. Determining how to invest your precious gold in order to score more, and which attack, defense, and buff cards to play is loads of fun. I  love the balance that cards like  Throne, Scales, and Water Bearer add, as they potentially aid both players, while the more aggressive animal cards bring just the right amount of nastiness to the table. Jambo earns a solid 9 that I'm sure will increase with more plays. In time I'm sure I'll add in the expansions too.

After one play, Jambo seemed a bit long for what it is. It takes a while for everyone to get their engines up and running, after which it's basically a race to get the necessary cards.  Will give this another go, but right now I don't see this one getting many repeat plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Very decent. Any card game with many card effects needs few games to know the deck. But I feel that Jambo is not as meatier as, say [thing=28143][/thing]/[thing=147020][/thing]/[thing=108745][/thing], which have nearly same learning curve. Probably because the game builds around a rather vague central goal(matching & sell the goods), comparing to RftG(build big and build more), Star Realm(Kill him), etc.

Tried our first game yesterday. Think the game is fun, but we realy need to "learn" all the cards first to make good combinations. So no rating yet. 

After about 4 plays. Ye still think its a fun game. only i got 2 plays where i had realy no luck with the carddrawing. But i don't think that the carddrawing is the winning factor in this game.

Jambo is a decent game of trading and trickery.  I found it a bit dry and stand-offish in the end though due to some lackluster mechanics.  Player interaction was very downplayed and there appeared to be a luck of the draw issue.  Ultimately, I found it a bit hard to keep my attention.  The game is very solid in concept though, just not as much fun in practice.

I went through phases of wanting to try this game.  My Secret Santa came through and got this gem for me.  I'm really glad he did in the end.  It really is a great blend of CCG mechanics and an economic engine into a short 2-player card game.  There's solid interaction and many interesting hand management decisions.

The rules are also surprisingly easy to pick up.

Dorn is really an odd duck for me.  I love Genoa and Jambo, but Arkadia and Goa really fell flat for me.  He's batting about 50/50 in my book.

Apr 08: This is still going strong.  I think it really is among the better of the Kosmos 2-player line.

I'm holding off with my final verdict on this one. First two plays were a little weird. 
In the second game my girlfriend (after 15 min. play) suddenly sprang from 25 gold to a little over 60...
I was a little flabbergasted by this. Maybe she had the 'once i a lifetime' super lucky hand, otherwise I may this too random.

A CCG-like experience in a fixed deck, this gets better the more you play it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The games feel reminds me a bit of Magic the Gathering in one particular way... much of the play of the game involves moving or transforming resources between (in no particular order) cards in hand, cards in play, gold, products and discarded cards (like the exchange of resources that happens in skilled MTG play as resources exchanges are made between cards in hand, cards in play, life points, and the discard pile).  Everything becomes a possible resource that can be spent to improve your position.

Game play is very significantly improved by adding BOTH expansions.  The first expansion is not so good by itself, but the first and second expansions combined create a significantly better game than the already pretty good base game.

This game is so much more than I initially thought it would be.  A solid trading system with elements of Magic the Gathering layered on top.  Utility cards function like artifacts, people and animals function like sorceries and there is even a subset of people cards that counter your opponent's animal cards.  The "7" is tentative and as always may go up or down with more plays.

UPDATE: Bumped up to an 8

Took a few games to get the hang of the cards use (and I doubt I'll ever memorise them)but the rules warned me about that. Have a feeling my rating will go down with more plays. Seems well balanced when I win and luck dependant when I lose but perhaps that's the hall mark of a good game?

Nice quick little game. It plays fast and has a nice rhythm. There is some card luck, but it doesn't seem too bad since a decent portion of the cards are all about evening out the card luck, things like draw n discard n, or draw an extra card for a cost, or get an extra good for a cost. There are some take that cards, which I'm usually not a fan of but they never felt too bad and take that feels more reasonable in two player to me anyway. Overall pretty solid quick little card game with a bit of meat to it.

Two-player trading card-game set in Darkest Africa. Player earn money buying and selling wares, all the while boosting their own efforts and thwarting their opponent by playing various special cards.My impression after a few games is that Jambo is a solid, CCG-like effort, but really nothing extraordinary. The game works OK and is fast and reasonably fun. The cards, some of which at first glance looks like stuff that would get banned within seconds had they been Magic: The Gathering cards, actually turn out to be quite balanced. In short, the game works and provides a nice gaming experience but it isn't really that exciting or out of the ordinary.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Action points are used to get cards, buy/sell wares, and use the items and people that are available.  While there is some strategy, this often comes down to who gets the right items.  Other cards are simply a bonus and can sway a tight game.  Some of the items are much more powerful than others, and they give a major advantage to one player.  The game is still a lot of fun.

RATING: 4
Good game, though I think it's a bit overrated here - it seems that a defensive, manipulative strategy is the best way to win in general.  Any other strategy I've tried against a defensive player has fallen flat on its face.

The defensive strategy seems to work better because you close yourself off from being attacked while disrupting your opponent (which is easy enough to do) by making it more expensive for them to make a profit - then you turn around and turn your stuff over on your turn, leaving nothing in your market, and trying to keep less utilities on the table than your opponent (in general).

If you play more agressively, you fall in to the defensive player's trap, and if your opponent is also playing defensively, it's still best to play defensively with most cards, just because it is more efficient to do so.

I'd love to play someone with a couple hundred games under their belt to see if they do something differently, but I think that who wins and loses this game is all in the cards, assuming the player is competent enough to use the cards they've got.

Jim's Copy.  Great two player card game.  For some reason or another it just never seems to get enough table time in our place.

A market/trading game with interesting interact between the players.  It's also extremely quick for the level of sophistication not found in many of the tiny 2 player card games (LotR: The Duel, Battle Line, etc.).

Would love to get the expansions, but I can imagine they add much without bogging the entire game down (as well as the sticker shock price for what is essentially a couple of booster packs).

Easy to learn mechanics with a variety of choices to make that is largely dependant on a random and somewhat painful card draw.  A firm knowledge of the card text is a must for combos, once accomplished, this game really takes off.  

We own expansion1.

Compact little 2P game. Rules can be understood in 5 minutes or so. The art and components are nice quality. Good fortune plays a role, as you don't want to expend too many actions attempting to draw a helpful card.

RATING: 8
Fun 2 player game of resource- and hand management. I see why people compare this to MTG. I like the special abilities of the tableu that is built a lot, but I AM a sucker for tableu building in general. Becomes much more about managing your actions than your resources when you get to know the cards, and the game really improves as your knowledge of the deck grows

Maybe the fact that I was victimized by two parrots, two rainmakers, repeated throne invasions and other "take-that" card plays all in my first game, I found the game to arouse mild irritation more than anything else. I know that my game was possibly exceptional in this regard (I had few such cards to play on my opponent, and they were usually negated by a guard), so the jury is still out. I could see myself scoring this slightly higher with a few more plays. Not a good first impression, though. I don't mind take-that cards in turn, but also having cards played out of turn seems a bit much to me.

Old comment: Can't shake the feeling that this is a single-deck nicotine patch for Mt:G addicts (I've been sober for 9 years now). That may not be a fair assessment, since the game can be appreciated on it's own terms, but if you've ever succumbed to CCGs, this one may feel a little automatic to you. Like the artwork and the theme, but (and I don't often say this) it does seem a bit far afield from the gameplay. Basically, the cards are balanced in such an abstract way that it hardly matters what they are, although when I'm in a creative mood I can turn this to my advantage. I've won almost every time I've played this. Good but not great. 

There is some subtlety to the game that it took me a while to fully appreciate, but after several more plays I've grown skeptical of a whole segment of decisions that are central to the game: namely, what to do when you're low on cards with no immediate mechanism for advancing. Spend a whole turn trying to get a single good utility? Spend only three actions and keep the one gold? The game is set up so that reckless card drawing can stunt your advance and lose you the game. Proceeding with caution, though, puts you more at the mercy of the draw. Not a bad game, but not a great one either.

There seems to be so much shuffling through the deck to get what you want.  Sometimes card draws make your game mindlessly easy; sometimes mindlessly frustrating.  You're taking cards that allow you to buy combinations of commodities, and then others that let you sell combinations (sometimes the same ones) at a profit.  Along the way are special powers that give you advantages or let you mess with the other guy.  Buy, collect, sell, and so on.

Like New other than some minor box ware. 4/5. Wonderful little 2 player card game. A little Take That, a little hand management, some cool card powers.

Great game, but we have other 2 player games that hit the table more often.

RATING: 6
Moderately disappointed with our first plays. But persevering, and it's really starting to grow on me.

A few plays later, and I'm really starting to come around on it. Once you get a handle on what the cards do, and the combinations that are possible, the fun goes up considerably and the game seems like much less of a drag. 

I will say, however, that a number of the cards seem to have little or no use - which is a disappointment when you end up with a hand full of them.

Most games end with us within a few gold of each other, which makes the tension of playing your cards in the best order a great deal of fun.

Jambo reminded me of the Sackson classic Bazaar with its general idea: purchasing colored pieces (ware cards) and try to gather combinations of them to fulfil color combinations (same ware cards). As it is a modern game, players have a number of actions and the game is spiced up with person, animal and item cards with special powers making it a more lively experience than the calm one offered by Bazaar.
Ranks among the top games of the Kosmos two-player-series and can hold its own against my so-far favourites The Settlers Card game and Odin's Ravens.

I really liked this the first few of times I played, but tired of it reasonably quickly.  Learning the game and discovering the best cards and moves was fun, but I don't like how you can cycle through the deck and not find anything of interest.  I enjoy games where every decision matters.  In Jambo, you often find yourself doing something simply because you have spare actions and may as well do something. 

Certainly worth picking up and playing, but not a keeper.

Fun game, some cards are a little vicious.  It hasn't been easy to figure out who's exactly ahead as the leader often swings back and forth.  A lot lies in the luck of the draw, but some cards can mitigate that.  One thing that bothers me about this game is its similarity to CCGs, which I know nothing about, but really dislike for some silly reason.  I find myself rarely wanting to play this game with so many other options.

This game didn't really click for me. Since all the wares had the same value, there wasn't much distinguishing one from another. There were too many cards to read which slowed down the game, although admittedly more playings would eliminate this. Finally I have a huge problem with the cardboard wares. Nice to look at, but I had a real problem with constantly having to pick 'em up and put 'em down.

Card-based trading game where goods contracts are used for both buying and selling. Then you send your crocodile into my market stall to eat my leopard figurine, after which it goes back to your market stall, eats a little of your gold and coughs up a roll of cloth. OK.

Balance, variety and length all seem fine, even though most of the time I felt I just couldn't draw contracts or utilities (whichever I didn't have lots of). I wonder about the game ending routine; it seems to encourage you to hold a high-scoring combination on hand, waiting for your opponent to just barely climb above 60 so you can get the last turn. The game lacks a hard clock.

So what happens, if in some blasphemous union, Magic: the Gathering and Puerto Rico spawn?  

Jambo!

Played this the first time last night.  Pretty fun.  Like Puerto Rico, you try to gather commodities and sell them for victory points, gold in this case.  However, like M:tG, you have a fistful of cards that aid your production and hinder your opponent's.

If it was only a commodities game, this would be a dud.  But the cool people (cards that usually benefit you), animal (cards that usually hinder your opponent), and utility (re-usable permanents similar to artifacts) cards really spice things up.  There's also the fact that you have to wisely invest your gold to get more gold that really gives it some strategy (I ended up spending all my gold on market stands and got creamed).  The African-themed artwork also gives it some coolness points.

Another fun game from Kosmos if you are ever looking for a quick game that you can play with a partner or spouse.

I'm holding my rating at a seven because I will play this game, even though I'm having trouble finding anyone who wants to play.  It's two players and it's not really an exciting theme.  The animals are cool and I love the art, but it's just buy low-sell high and I feel like I haven't really gotten into it yet.  I'll play it a couple more times before I lower the rating.  It seems like San Juan totally kicked this game in the pants.  I have even less desire to play now.

Bought 080619. A cute little self-contained Magic-lite for the casual gamer. As an old hand in Magic:tg it feels a little lacking in options and combos. Improved with each of the first three playings, though. 

UPDATE: Kind of tempting to get the expansion, but it does push the game cost into "big box territory". Still, if it keeps getting played this often it is probably worth it.

Jambo ranks as one of the best of the 2-player Kosmos games, and it really does shine under the following conditions:

a) Both you and your opponent have a firm grasp of how to use seemingly unrelated cards in combinations, and

b) You're both fairly cut-throat competitive.

Condition a is required. If you're playing against someone who can't quite put together the available combos in their head, they'll be lost and likely not provide much challenge to you - in which case, they're not likely to ask for this again.

Condition b is not required. It is perfectly okay to play Jambo without direct player interaction. You can get through a game without using the animal cards to mess up your opponent, but in my experience, it's no fun that way. Half the fun of this game is unleashing a gorilla or elephant into the markets, or sending your parrot off to steal from your opponent. As long as you're both in a competitive frame of mind, you should enjoy this one.

Jambo won me over almost immediately. It's a neat little two-player game in which you are racing to get to 60+ gold before your opponent. The components are merely OK, but the artwork on the cards is very well done. The rules are easy to learn, and gameplay is quick (with very little analysis paralysis). A game of Jambo can be played in around 45 minutes, which is perfect for a game like this one.

I don't think I've developed a decent strategy for winning yet, but there seems to be some depth to the game other than draw card and play it.

I want to like this more than I do- I really do. But it feels like it goes on nearly twice as long as it ought.

This is a fun game and there are some things in this game that are similar to MTG, but it ends up being just a slighty above average game with some very minute similarities to MTG.

Jess's old favorite now replaced by Race for the Galaxy. Nice euro feel compacted into 40 minutes of game time.  There are opportunities to mess with each other if you enjoy that direct interaction but you can still do well even if you focus only on your own plans.

Recently got both expansions as a secret santa gift.  We started with just expansion #1 included.  Should have read the reviews though as all reviews say to just use both right off.  I didn't realize the second expansion was supposed to balance out the first so no cards are removed.

After several plays, I found myself getting bored of the choices that the game offers. There is likely a deeper level of play in there, but I don't feel compelled to find it.  It tries to scratch the collectible card game itch, but I don't think it does it very well. As a former Magic player, I know that I wouldn't have any fun playing against someone with the very same deck. [b]6[/b]

RATING: N/A
Players take on the role of merchants offering their wares from market stands. On a player's turn, he has five actions to choose from. Actions can be used to draw cards, play cards and activate buildup cards.

In order to sell wares, the merchants must first lay the wares out, since customers will only buy where all the wares they want are being offered. And since market space is at a premium, players have to think hard about which wares to offer.

By owning important buildup cards and properly using the assets of other village inhabitants, the merchants succeed in attracting especially many customers to their stalls, making bargain buys, and messing with their opponents' plans.

The first player to reach a set cash level through buying and selling of wares is the winner.

RATING: 6.5
After one play it's Rüdiger Dorn's Race for the Galaxy for me. I like or really like Dorn's games but one play was not enough to see the merits of Jambo. One play just felt too luck-dependent as my opponent got all the utility cards that give you wares and my utility cards only gave me cards that were not really good for anything. Also the first market expansion card appeared at about 3/4 of the game, while animal cards also didn't appear soon enough. So, after one play it just feels too luck-dependent and long for what it is. 

But I'm almost sure it is not this luck-dependent when you already know and feel the deck; also probably it also gets a lot faster with time. I didn't like my first play but compared to Race for the Galaxy it has the advantage that I DO want to play it more to really know if I like it or not.

Several plays.  Not a bad 2-player game, but quite luck driven.  Often, it is pointless to plan, since turns are so tactical, and whatever you were planning at the end of your turn you won't be able to do next turn.  Still, I like the idea that the losing player gets a final chance to come back to win after somebody triggers the end condition.

With the two expansions this game is just perfect.  The two expansions take away most games that have too much random luck and make it a very strategic game, that's different every time.

I really like this two player Kosmos game and the CCG atmosphere it brings to the table.  There may be limited replayability once you play enough times where you learn the card combos, but there seems to be several different routes to victory initially.  It definitely brings an interesting blend of MTG where you can "tap" different utility cards which allow you to "break the rules" mixed in with a little bit of an economic engine where you are buying and selling different trade goods.  There is a bit of "take that" which can be part of the action cards.

"Clever trading for two"?  No, I don't think so.  This is just another game of racing to optimize your own little table space.  I had my hopes raised by the presence of cards that directly interact with your opponent, but most of them are unimaginative take-that effects (steal a ware, destroy a utility) and do not raise tough tactical decisions when in hand.

The entire game revolves around buying and selling these little chits ("wares"), but the rub is that you can't buy or sell them until the cards you play tell you that you can do so.  And so the entire game is about cycling through as many cards as you can to facilitate this.

This will be little surprise to any Magic: The Gathering player familiar with the idea of "card advantage", and yet it seems that Rudiger Dorn didn't quite grasp this.  All the cards effectively cost the same to play, whether they are weak or extremely powerful -- there's no staggering of costs like mana costs in M:tG or varying building costs in San Juan.  And so you're lucky and on your way to a win if you can get the guaranted-each-turn payoff of the Supplies, or the devastating Tribal Elder, and unlucky if you're stuck with crap like the Crocodile or the Rainmaker.

I think there was an interesting game to have made out of this premise.  Imagine, for example, if the buying and selling prices of the goods went up and down depending on how over- or under-supplied they had been in the game:  you'd have to carefully watch your opponent's economic activity and adjust your own accordingly.  Alas, there's nothing like that to Jambo.  Just play cards, set up your little engine, and hope you draw better than your opponent.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I heard that this is a great 2-player game, but I was just bored while playing. Additionally, I never drew an additional market from the draw pile the entire game. My opponent drew every one of them, despite my efforts to draw a lot of cards via various tool cards. Seriously limited my ability to get enough variety in my goods selection to fulfill orders. It just felt very rinse and repeat, and rather uninspiring.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Great, short management game, flavored with special power cards and combos.

I enjoy both the tactics and strategy aspects of the game.  On the tactics side, many combinations can be invented and used during a single game play (even on the first play), which gives a great feeling of control.  On the strategy side, I enjoy the fact that you can keep all the cards you draw; you can thus make longer term plans.

Similar to Magic: special power cards, buying/selling = blocking/attacking, gold = life.  But Magic is more fun: more varied powers, more interplay between abilities, more flavor,…  However, Magic has complex rules (see the CompRules, see the weight on BGG).

-----------------
Jambo compared to other popular 2-player games

* Intro
- Very good description of the details of the game: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/277859 (ColMustard)

- Jambo plays (for me) more like a CCG-like game (side with http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/154685 and http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/211290).  Less of an "economic game", because investments (buying wares) and sales are basic: nothing like building an economic engine like what can be done in Race for the Galaxy.  That said, selecting what wares to buy adds a thin but interesting layer.

- Comparison: Very good 2 player games (as rated by the BGG polls)

* How deep is Jambo?
- Not as deep as Race for the Galaxy (by far), but takes the same time.

* Jambo as a set collection game

Yes, but only to a certain extent: not playing Jambo as a special powers card game is quite boring, as it boils down to basic set collection: get wares, and sell them when you get a card that matches…  Our first couple of games were quite boring: we were waiting for the victory condition to kick in.

* Jambo as a "special powers" card game?

- There is a certain Dominion (the base game) feel to the special powers.  Many of them have "basic" effects such as augmenting your hand, helping you to select good cards, giving you more money, etc.  Netrunner also comes to mind: cards give you useful advantages and fill needs that vary during the course of the game.

- Not as "pure" in terms of special powers as Netrunner, because one has to buy and sell wares.

- Very interesting combos can be made, and can be made often (more so than in Netrunner, it seems).  The special powers of the Animals/People/Utilities fill needs that may either be punctual or on a longer time scale. However, they are not as varied as in Netrunner.  For instance, only 3 Utilities can be used at a given point in time, which limits the possible synergies.

* How tense is Jambo?

- Not as tense as Schotten-Totten, where you're constantly thinking and trying to go faster than your opponent.

- Not as fast paced as Dominion (base game), which flows more smoothly (because decisions about how to play your hand are easy to make).

* How interactive is Jambo
- There are many ways of bothering your opponent (stealing wares, cards,…), and it you have many opportunities to do so during a game.  More so than in  Dominion, and generally for a very specific purpose (e.g. stealing *the* kind of ware you need in order to sell a group of 3 wares).

* How rich is Jambo

- Fewer shifts in "needs"/short term strategies: compared to Agricola (stone comes later, family members too,…), NetRunner (adapt your needs to your opponent), Race (interesting projects shift depending on what cards you get).

* Conclusion
- I'd be happy to hear about other 2-player 40 minute games that could be compared to Jambo.

***************

Update (2015-9)

I now find the powers quite uninteresting, compared to a game like Magic (or Puzzle Strike, or even Trains). Their effects also feel quite "random", without so much place for a strategy, with too many quick changes or "spot" effects (compared to a game like Magic where the cards stay longer in play and/or have more important effects).

An okay game of buy/trading goods that has a CCG feel to it. Generally I like the idea of this game as I enjoy finding creative card combination. In fact, I lost my first games because I was more focused on interesting combos. I lost, but had a good time.

Our last game, however, went on much too long and illustrated one of the downfalls of the game for us. It is very difficult to get cards. This makes it even more difficult to get good cards. As such, our last game we both tried to make something happen and never did.

Traded.

RATING: 8
[GAMEID=12002] was a game that intially stood out due to its unique theme.  Rather than another game set in medieval Europe, this one had an early colonial Africa trading theme.  The artwork on the cards is very good and the wares are nice thick cardboard.  I always enjoy the actual physical buying and trading of goods off of my market stand.

The game has a lot of special card play, but since it involves buying and selling goods, it doesn't feel as aggressive as other "duel-like" CCGs.  There is no actual free form trading between the players, which is always difficult in a two player game.  The focus instead is on playing different card combinations and resource management, both wares and perhaps more importantly cards.  You can use cards to rearrange your wares and cards, buy and seel them to maximize profit, and sometimes even directly interfere with your opponent's market.  The utilities cards give you a sense of building up permanent special powers.  Most of the cards tend to not be too one-sided---for example, many of the cards will give you a choice of an action and then give your opponent the other.  This makes the game feel more balanced and less aggressive, although outright aggressive cards do exist such as the Crocodile.  This is the game that really highlighted my girlfriend's gift for special card play and resource management, and I'm almost always trying to play catch up.

Jambo is a fun two-player market game that is certainly a worthwhile purchase.  Players compete to earn 60 gold by the clever use of cards to purchase and sell wares.  The game gets somewhat chaotic, though, limiting the possibility of really long-term planning (it's somewhat random).  I like that, and I like being able to play a market game with fewer than 3 players.  Goa, Emerald and Jambo, all by Rudiger Dorn, are great games!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This one is one of the more-often played in our budding game collection. I like the economic element of buying and selling wares. It seems like we're not playing the game to its fullest extent, though, because neither of us tend to take advantage of many of the strategies/elements that I assumed would be vital to the game; i.e. purchasing an extra market stand.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I want to like Jambo. I really, really do. At it's core, it is a really interesting light resource management game for two players. By and large, the card powers are interesting, and not so strong as to render your decisions impotent. It goes on a bit too long sometimes, but that's forgivable, and can be fixed by changing how much money you want to play to.

What I can't forgive, though, is that it is pretty much mandatory to stay close to your opponent in card flow, especially at the beginning of the game, and whether you can do that or not is determined entirely by the luck of the draw. A strong early lead in card cycling is almost unstoppable because you can protect it with all of the take that cards you'll draw, stealing or destroying anything especially useful your opponent plays.

There is one out, mind you: the Elder can get you a full hand and cannot be prevented by a Guard. If you get it before it is too late and it provides a bit of card cycling, you may stand a chance. Having to grind through a bunch of nothing turns, praying that you draw one of two cards in a rather large deck, though, is not my idea of a fun time.

When card cycling is relatively even, though, I think Jambo is a lot of fun, and if somebody can explain to me convincingly how I'm wrong about the card drawing thing, I'd happily play it regularly.

Good game. A bit longer to play than I always expect. And just a bit longer than it should be. One of those games that feels slightly larger than a 'mere' 2 player game. We rarely play this, so I must not love it... downgrading from 6 to 5.

I keep looking into the expansion but then decide it will be too much work to figure out a proper card mix. Decline.

Perhaps my favorite of the 2-Player Series. 

It's an action point system wherein you try to develop a card advantage engine ultimately allowing you to sell more and win. There are slight variances to the strategy, but that is it's core.

AFTER 1 PLAY:  I am very impressed with this game after one play.  There's a lot going on here, many decisions to make, but not overwhelmingly so.  When played at just the right time right, the utility cards can be powerful but not to point where they can break the game open.  Nice artwork and unique them give bonus points.  I can see this one getting a lot of play.  *UPDATE 11/05* After a few more plays, keeping the "9" rating.  The card interactions and capacity for clever timing keeps this one warm for me.

11/07 - Not getting played, traded.

After two initial plays, a fine game but quite card draw dependent.  Still, it is engaging enough to be fun.
Belated UPDATE: yes, card dependent. And quite prone to getting stuck, where neither can do much to advance their position due to the wrong materials or just a lack of space on the market. We even took to putting out a couple of Small Markets in the set-up. I rather feel we have moved on from Jambo now and though I read that the expansion(s) improves things, we moved onto other - better - 2 player games.

  Jambo is fun, but there are just too many 2 player games that I think are better to rate it higher than a seven.  It's not that it's a bad game, it's just not a particularly good game.  Gameplay seems very polished, but isn't really interesting. The pieces are nice, but it almost doesn't seem worth it to sort out all the gold pieces and wares to play it.  (That may seem like nitpicking since there aren't that many pieces, but when I play a light two player game I have little patience for set up.)  I would recommend Jambo as a fun game and worth the price, but it doesn't wow me.  That being said it is kinda of relief to play a game that isn't so dry and it does work to a certain degree at conveying a theme.

Not necessarily a gateway game. First 2-3 games may take 1-2 hours. Afterwards, 30-45 minutes seems to be the general length. It is clearly an economic trading type of card game. As a quick short filler game, Odin's Ravens is a better pick when graduating from Lost Cities. Jambo has more of a full game.

Super two-player from Kosmos. Wonderful components and lovely artwork. Game play has nice combo of luck and strategy. Managed to pull out a win on first game, despite never getting a small market. Nice balance of one-shot cards and ones that can be used over and over.

RATING: 9
A good trading game for 2 players, that offers a decent amount of interaction through the animal cards. The theme is carried off nicely, with great artwork. The expansions are unnecessary for this game, and after a while we stopped using them. The base game holds up really well to repeated play, and after years this still sees a lot of play in our house.

It has a CCG feel (many different cards; the sad part is that some are very weak and others very strong: not a good thing when both players draw from the same deck). More tactical than strategical and with a good dose of luck.
I needn't it as in the same category (2-player games with cards doing different effects) I consider Magic to be superior (by far).

Very interesting game. It will take a bit to get used to all of the cards, but they were easy to understand and use. The tension of trying to predict which wares you should have in your market was a lot of fun - somehow it never seemed to want to work out. The variety of people and animal cards kept the pace of the game interesting.

The players are African merchants that compete in a race to acquire the most wealth. The cards are depicted with beautiful artwork, are quite unique and interact nicely.

This is the best 2 player game I own.  Unbelievable. The only reason it doesn't get a 10 is because a few of the cards are overpowered... Tribal Elder, maybe Supplies. I heard a lot of this is balanced out in the expansions but they're impossible to find.

I am really impressed with this one. Simply the best 2-player card game IMO.

The small luck factor (card draws) is easily overcome by good tactics. Its not what you draw, its how & when you use a card or card combination.  Some say there are too many animals & people and not enough ware cards...maybe so but with shrewd resource management it becomes such a minor issue.

Looking forward to the Expansion (Essen 2007). Update: The cardback discoloration has made the expansion almost useless...what a shame!

UPDATE:  I still enjoy this, but it's getting a little too familiar after 100 plays.  I'm sure it'll still hit the table occasionally, though.

Received March 2007 along with Clash of the Gladiators in exchange for Neolithibum.
Finally played in September.  I like it and my wife likes it.  So far, each of our two games has been very different, and neither time did we get even close to making it all he way through the 112-card deck.  So I think there is a good bit of re-playability here.

This will go up after more plays, because man is it a solid little game. Easy to learn, easy to teach, and brimming with possibilities.

I can see how each game will be different, not too conflict-y (a plus for Alysia), and interesting. I like that you can plan ahead but still need to adapt to changing circumstances, that your VP supply is also your gold supply, and that you never have enough actions (with the extra sting that drawing cards can eat up more than one action).

Definitely fun as a CCG player, without requiring that you be one to play it. Good stuff!

Didn't think i would enjoy it as much as i do. There's a lot of text on the cards in Jambo, but i find it adds flavor and unique abilities to each one, making the game have a good amount of variety. It's a nice step up from Jaipur. The theme isn't as dry as you might think for a market game. The artwork on the variety of cards does a good job of giving Jambo some soul. There's a few attack cards that give this one a little touch of player interaction.

It takes a few games to get used to the special power cards to the degree that you can fully grok what the card can or can't do for you by glancing at the excellently done artwork. Done get discouraged by slow play your first few games.

I bought it specifically for my wife and I to play since she loves the 2-player variant of San Juan. I am not disappointed in the slightest.

Great little game for two.

A solid trading game, not as streamlined as Jaipur, but with more elements, including animals to unleash on your opponents, villagers provide one off help and objects to give ongoing assistance.   Set collection, attack, defence, surprises, plenty of options to influence the game.  Unfortunately it is a bit long, and tends to overstay its welcome, and the endgame can be a bit of a grind.

On 1st play: impression is good. I was sceptical if the buy and sell mechanism would work, but it did.

I also played it with the first expansion: it becomes an even better game!

Magic light as I like to call this game.  I never got into the Magic the Gathering frenzy.  I nonetheless played it numerous times with friends.

I truly like this game.

Only one plays so far, but I can see the potential in it. My only worry is that sixty points to trigger victory seems like it might make for a short game once we're more experienced. Maybe not. A very interesting two-player game for which I may buy the expansions once we've had a few more plays.

Two player. Card based. Trading. Light confrontation. Fairly fast, but meaty enough. Those are all good things what we like in games, yet Jambo managed to hit the very spot where all of the above combined just can't grab us.

RATING: 4.5
The only way I can describe the way jambo doesn't work for me is that it feels like trying to skip way to heavy rocks across the water.  You find a perfectly shaped rock, cock back and throw with all the grace of an assassin, and "klumum-ppp" it goes straight to the bottom.  Combos take effort to set up, but the payoff is often little better than just stubbornly slogging ahead.  This may just be a personal disconnect, but when I spend 4 turns digging and setting up a 5 action combo I expect to see my stone skip that many times and have everyone stand back and say "oooooh" and "aaaah" as it sails on and on...

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Game in a Nutshell: Two player card game where you compete to buy and sell goods to be the first to a set profit. Item, Animal, and People cards are mixed in to help you along the way.

Played as: The game is Two-Player only.

Pros: A nice mix of hand management and set collection-- I’ll coin it a set management game. The pivotal mechanic to the game, which is that each goods card has the opportunity to either buy and sell what’s on it at a variable price, makes for simple but interesting twist on hand management. Add that to the limited space on your stand and it leaves a pretty interesting balance that players have to deal with. The misc. other cards add just the right amount of variety to allow for different strategies over repeat plays.

Cons: The action point allowance system is the biggest downer for me. First off, spending valuable action points to look for just one decent card at the start of your turn sucks when you draw a bunch of garbage. That, in the biggest way, enables luck of the draw to really be a game changer. Sure it increases your ability to come up with a decent card, but in doing so you may eliminate half your allowable actions.  Plus I hate having to count how many actions I’ve used when I’m trying to focus on the game. Doing it for your opponent (the way the rules suggest it) sucks too since I’d really like to be planning my turn, not counting to five. Some of the animal or people cards can be viciously unfair (and downright mean) if played at certain times.

Other: I still need to play this game more to get better understanding of it. There seems to be a tactical aspect to the game that takes a familiarity to the different cards to really wrap your head around the different avenues of play. It’s interesting this is coined a trading game but not in the way you might think a trading game to be. I believe trading implies negotiation, of which there is none here. Simply, players trade in a card and money for goods; then later, trade the goods and a card for money. So in this sense, it’s more of an "exchanging" or "buy n’ sell" game rather than a ‘trading’ game. [end/nerd-rant]

Best Use: Another lighter game to add to your two-player arsenal when looking for some more variety.

This has become a favorite.  It's deeper than the other games Jacqui prefers, but I'm extremely pleased to see that the depth is what is bringing her back to it.  She requests this game and that is quite a statement.  The more I play, the more I appreciate the design.  There is potential for real back and forth play and it feels like a real battle to squeak ahead.  I rate this a bit lower than Morels and Jaipur because it is longer and more fiddly.  Honestly it's a deeper and therefore "better" game, but the others play so quickly that they have an edge.

Enjoyable 2P "meaty filler". Too hard for the kids, too long for casual gaming, but a nice quick game for gamers looking for a short playtime. I like trading, growing food, farms, and special card powers, however. So for now, it's a upper-middle-tier game.

I continue to enjoy games designed by Rudiger Dorn.  This is a great two-player game! I enjoy the economic aspect of buying and selling goods; it just has a great clean feel and flow to it.

RATING: 7
Initially (after the first couple plays) I wasn't all that impressed. After the fourth game my rating jumped from a 6 to an 8! This is a great, two-player, bring with you anywhere game. It's easy to get hung up on trying to buy and sell goods and forget that part of this game is attacking the other player. You really need to get three or four plays under your belt before you can appreciate the mechanics. With both expansion packs this game is a 10 (in the realm of two player, all-in-one-box games).

Excellent magic-like but not-collectible 2-player "trading" game. Some cards are useless/very narrow uses, and GF doesn't "get it" which keeps the score down. Beautiful art.

An enjoyable and original feeling combination of economic & CCG mechanics.  The card-drafting is great & there's some fun card-combo play.  Really, you want to cycle through cards and play your action points efficiently -- tougher than it sounds.  Many will be turned off by the luck of the cards and some of the screwage that happens but repeated plays and a feel for the deck should even most of that out.

RATING: N/A
*Jan 2013* Only played this with both expansions but no huts, relics, nor rugs (yet). This game is pretty awesome. Can go a little long, at least during the early games. Reminds me of Monopoly Deal only more strategic with less luck. MD's big advantages are that it plays quickly and plays with more than 2. This game's big advantage is that you don't feel shafted by the luck of the draw. Long as you prepare yourself for most eventualities, games will be close.

Too long to be a light game and may be a bit bloated, but score may improve with further plays. Ratings and plays are in the Expansion 2 category as that's the only way I've played this game

This is good; I'd definitely play it again. I was hoping for something a bit meatier - maybe if some commodities were worth more than others? but then maybe luck would play too large a role.

Rating this was hard.  I have played it a few times with my g/f and its ok, it passes some time, but feel I have to be a bit cautious or its a beat up.  When I play with my brother its a close vicious hard out game which I really enjoy.  So its a little context based.  In the end I have other 2 player games Sarah likes more and other conflict ones I'd rather play with my brother, so its probably going to get traded eventually.

RATING: 9
Jambo had the reputation of being one of the best 2-player economic card games out there, but it’s out of print. So when I found a dusty old copy for 20 euros in Lucca 2014 I immediately snatched it! It definitely lived up to my expectations, as it is super tight, with lots of tactical decisions and great variety. It also looks like it will be enjoyable in multiple plays. Very happy with it and would recommend it if you can find it.
EDIT: Raised to 9 out of 8 because after 4-5 plays it still felt fresh and interesting, showing it has great replayability.

2p only, which means it won't get much play for me. Interesting. It had more play than I suspected based on the explanation. I've only played a "nice" variant (with most of the animals removed) and I got a little hosed on storage space, which made for a challenging play. I'd go again but not one I'd seek out.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Played twice.  An enjoyable two-player game that's based around acquiring and selling resources (to gain money).  This has enough complexity in it to make multiple strategies appear viable, yet enough cards (and enough of each type of card) to keep it from devolving into a card-counting nightmare.  It can be pretty luck based, however (as some cards, when gotten early, can swing the balance of a game drastically). I definitely want to play this some more.

Fun 2 player card game. Doesn't take a lot of time to learn the basic rules which are only a few pages long and very well written.  After that everything you need to know as you play is basically printed on the cards themselves so there's a very low learning curve for this one. However it plays pretty deep with players having to make some interesting choices.

At least in the dutch version some card texts are not very clear and can be explained several ways.

It seems like a decent game, but lasts too long thanks to so many different animal and utility cards.  Still, I'd recommend it for a 2-player filler.

African merchant themed, standalone card game with that "collectible card game" feel, for two players.  My wife and I really enjoyed this for a while, but then Race For The Galaxy came out and we haven't touched this since. I look forward to playing it again.

Update: Now that the sheen of RFTG has worn off, I'd rate these games about equally. This one has less brain burn.

Rated a 6.5 after one play. It seems nice but not really memorable or outstanding. I'd like to play a few more games to get a better feel for it.

I enjoyed my first game of Jambo. The cards are interesting, and some nice combos and strategies become quickly apparent, making me want to play again. My girlfriend is probably right in saying it was a little long, but we were also playing inefficiently.

My biggest complaint is that the game seems to almost be too clever for its own good.  Too many action cards that provide exceptions to the rules, too few ware cards that actually let you accomplish what you are supposed to accomplish.  That may be the point, and some people may like that, but for some reason it rubs me the wrong way.

Jambo is a fun, well-made two-player game, especially as a light end to the evening.  It's a fairly simple trading (mixing and matching goods) game with interesting possibilities for combos.  A fair amount of luck is involved in the distribution of cards though.  Regardless, a solid game.

Two player game where one buys wares (giving up gold) or selling wares (earning gold). Players play cards out of their hands for the wares, people or animal cards to affect your opponent or utility cards which stay in the game and give you special benefits. It's a decent game, I haven't had a chance to set up double card combinations yet which is where you can potentially really mess with your opponent.

Only two plays in, but I think I like it. I don't think I have a strategy at all. Gathered more plays and my feeling for the game are getting wonky. I find that I enjoy the card play for the most part but it can be fiddly with a lot of wares, and most of my games there are only 3-5 trades that happen. There are also some dead times where both players are drawing cards hoping to dig something out of the draw deck.

Quite cut-throat, but fairly light and fun.  Intersting card interactions and combinations.  Not sure how it will be after more plays, and I've only played about five times to date.  It hasn't really "grabbed" me yet, but I won't give up on it too soon.

I want to say that Jambo is a big game in a small package, but that is more like what Jambo wants to be. Instead, Jambo gives the feeling of one's little brother/sister desperately trying to play with the big kids. A good little game though. Points for trying.

There are some shockingly good combos that, if you are dealt them, will almost certainly guarantee a win.  But for the most part Jambo is a well-balanced economic game that I'd gladly play again as a 2-outta-3 series when it's just me and one of my gaming buddies.

Don't know if it'd pass the sweetheart test, but I'm insanely curious to find out.

I consider Jambo as a card expansion to Asante since I play with megadeck with both games combined and I mainly use rules from Asante. And I for the fact that I orginally owned Asante and purchased Jambo later.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
It's a very interactive card game about trading, with some combo and take that elements. I can see why it gets so much love. It's quite random, but it offers you many options and decisions every round. The rules are pretty simple and straightforward, but then the cards have a lot of text that will slow the pace until you get used to them.

It's too swingy for me, you're at the mercy of the cards and you have little control. That's not too bad, but it's not a short game either. It's a good game, but not for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Jambo has a feeling of originality because of mechanics and theme. On the other hand it has quite similar feel to Magic: the Gathering although it's buying/selling rather than confrontation but there is enough cards that have direct interaction between players. Excellent choice if you only have two players. Similar to CCG's there is lots of text on almost every card. But after few games you'll know them well enough to play without reading too much. There seems to be many ways you can lose in this game... (but all games have been pretty tight matches)

Update (13.8.2006): After few more plays it is certain I like Jambo very much. Pumped up rating from 8 to 9.

Update (10.5.2008): The expansion is a good one but not a necessary one. Good to have if you play a lot of Jambo.

Almost the perfect 2-player game, particularly if a price quotient is taken into account. Enough luck element to keep both parties interested; an absolutely flawless ruleset, and every single twist possible to include in a deck of cards. The rules are almost unnecessary after the first playing - the hallmark of great design. The perfect game for couples, and definitely much more than just a faux-CCG. Magic fans need to play it more aggressively - they'd be surprised at the results.

[b]Jambo[/b] was sold via auction and I gave a copy away.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Since we have limited space for games, I gave this to a friend because I knew it would see limited play with all the other 2p games we have. I prefer playing Arboretum, Battle Line, Morels or Musee with my wife.[/i] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (9):[/COLOR]

[i]- My wife enjoys it, we have already played 5 times since receiving it in a trade.
- I love the combination of set collection and buying/selling goods to make a profit.
- The different cards really add a lot of depth to what essentially is a set collection game.

I am always on the lookout for a quick playing game to play with my wife, and Jambo has been a hit. This also is a great game to play with older kids (8+ give or take).
It is too bad that this game is now OOP, but Asante seems to be the spiritual successor to Jambo. In fact you can combine the Asante cards with the Jambo cards.[/i]

A market game, but the "special ability" cards are at least as important as the buying and selling. There are a lot of special abilities, and most are on the complicated side (as opposed to simple "pay one less" bonuses). If you don't like special ability cards, you probably won't like this game.

Although it is sometimes compared to Jaipur, they really don't feel anything like each other. Jambo is much more aggressive, more fiddly, and more complicated. Based on two plays, Jambo felt more random and luck-driven than Jaipur (which I have played a lot).

I thought I would hate the art, but honestly other than the pictures of the crocodiles, I hardly even noticed the images.

I think the weight of 2.1 is reasonable, but I might go 2.2. Mechanically it is comparable to San Juan, but Jambo seems lighter and more random in terms of depth of play.

RATING: 7
This game is like MtG gone business! PLayers try to buy goods at low price and sell 'em at high price. In the midst they use cards to try and scew the opponent. The cards are all fine, players draw from the same deck and try playing best according to circumstances and available cards in hand. I think this is a fine game, not the best in the kosmoms 2-players collection, but defenetly on the top rank. I still prefere the likes of Dracula or Starship Catan.

First play with wife went very well. Easy to learn, lots of variety in the cards and combos without adding MTG complexity, and a great theme. She likes it better than Thebes and Kingsburg, said she'd have no problem playing this many times, and it was less than half the price of those games!

RATING: 6
A decent economic card game for which my enthusiasm has waned.  The five actions allowed per turn together with cards that can have quite a bit of text can slow the game down and cause the game to last longer than it should at times.  Some cards are very interactive, but some draws result in very solitary play.  I am not a huge fan of "steal stuff from your opponent"  or "destroy X if your opponent has it" type of card effects.  I enjoy interaction in games quite a bit, but I just do not like cards that are overly "screw you".  I admire the game, but there are other card games that I have grown to prefer.

An excellent stroll-to-the-cafe-and-pay-a-game-with-the-girlfriend game. Jambo is my second favorite of the little Kosmos duels (just behind [i]Blue Moon[/i]).  It has that particular Rudiger Dorn feeling of lots of possibilities to explore.  

I like that it feels like a board game distilled and refined into a little card game.  I like how it is the smallest of the many economic games I enjoy.  I got the first expansion, but like the game better without it.

Nice little two-player card game.  While it's mainly buying and selling things from the bank, there are enough interactive elements to keep players interested in what the other is up to.  While having to keep track of your opponent's action is a gimmick to keep players involved, it works.  It seems like sometimes you get cards that help you get a lot more cards, and sometimes you don't, but for some reason it doesn't make as much of a point difference as you'd think it would.

I actually quite like this system. You have to manage your hand and card draw is crucial. You are only given 1 card per turn by default (which also uses up at least 1 action) and you need to race to get the most money. The game is a bit text heavy the first few times you play it though, but that starts to fade quickly once you've seen the cards.

A game that I hope gets reprinted, especially with the expansions.

I couldn't really get on with Jambo - both of us felt we were waiting around for things to happen, and then a swing happens due to some card or happening to land the right combination of goods.

A fun 2-player game.  After 2 plays, I feel that the cards reward strong tactical play, and any sort of long term strategy is secondary.  There's a healthy amount of player interaction and quite a few interesting card combos.  I'm hoping to play this regularly and finding some good playing styles.

Rating upped, from 8 to 9. This has been a go-to game for me and my wife for years now.  I traded for both expansions, which add more awesome stuff, but just the base game is more than enough.  Jambo is straightforward, but you can explore many different strategies, and clever play is rewarded.  One of my all-time-favorite games!

After three plays I'm feeling a bit disappointed with Jambo. It has a lot of things that I really like: trading theme, nice artwork, some ccg feel. But the game play seems so trivial and the choices pretty obvious. The different actions I take during a game doesn't feel like they string together into a whole. It's like there is no dramatic curve to the game.

Cute and colourful, easy to set up and play. Can be a tad frustrating if your opponent is slow as there's nothing to do while they're having their turn (5 moves per go) but imagine the speed will pick up once the cards are more familiar.

RATING: 3
This little economic card game is easy to learn and play, and is good for a quick filler type game. The artwork on the cards is really beautiful.

D and I were both disappointed with the game overall... it felt really dry. We were both feverishly racing to a conclusion -- not because we wanted to win but because we both wanted to end the game and play something else.

I think it's really a good game, but just not our cup of tea. We have more fun playing Lost Cities when we want a quick card game D said at the end: "Well, that was no Killer Bunnies" (which is one of his favorites.)

While there's certainly no war in Jambo, and the deck is shared, some of the same genious gameplay is there (utilities tap, nice artwork, set point value to reach), and it's really quite accessable.

Only a partial play, but enough for me to know this is not my kind of game. Firstly, I prefer pace and there are way too many text cards which you have to read while your opponent waits for you...obviously more plays will reduce this waiting element, but since there are some "take that" actions disrupting any plans, I can't get enthusiastic about exploring card combo's ala San Juan. If this wins the SDJ this year.....mmm.

Another in the 2-player line from Kosmos. There is a hint of a good game here but after repeated plays it all depends on the cards drawn. Typical of the Kosmos 2-player line, the game seems under-developed. The only two great games in this line are Blue Moon and Rosenkonig. Seeing that Kosmos is capable of producing at those levels then this type of game is not acceptable. Play one of the other two games.

If you're looking for a relatively quick, light, and fun two-player game, then you won't get much better than Jambo. The mini economics engine is excellent, and there's nothing more satisfying than watching your opponent create a smooth little operation, then tearing it apart by unleashing an elephant or crocodile on them.

RATING: 5
A rather elegant set collection game at it's heart, Jambo features a deck stuffed with cards that have poorly balanced special rules which ultimately turn it into a game of sheer luck. Which is a pity, because it sometimes feels fun, and other times feels like the worst of eurogame solitaire.

A bit heavier than the other Kosmos two player games.

I probably just didn't 'get' it, but the game seemed muddled, with few decisions to make and your fate determined mostly by luck of the card draw.

I did see the potential that I may have missed something important, and I'd be willing to try it again sometime - maybe.

this game is fun enough, but it lacks any real tension. i think the game would have been better with a different end game condition. as it stands, racing to be the first to get 60 gold pieces just doesn't generate enough tension, or player interaction, in my opinion. while there is a "take that" element to some of the cards, it's really minor. (though i do love that parrot card. bwahahaha . . .) also, it feels like, once you become familiar with the cards, you're just playing the odds as you calculate your best market options with your cards in hand, and hope that you draw can draw into some card drawing and/or the cards you need. also the powers of some of the cards are random in nature, making them, in this ex-magic player's opinion, useless. it's already a card game, why do designers feel compelled to add even more randomness? still, i enjoy playing the game and would play it now and again. 

update: one thing that can make this game drag is when neither player can manage to draw into any goods cards. without any way for either player to generate any notable amount of income, this game can become a snoozefest. rating still stands as is. 

update: i actually play this more than my rating might suggest, but it's just missing that certain something that i look for in games that would push it into my top tier of games.

This game has some really fun elements but the "take that" componant of the animals is just obnoxious and unenjoyable. I don't enjoy playing the attack cards or having them played on me. They just distract from what is fun about the game: maximizing the value of each action spent and trying to make the best trades. 

The game is also much slower than Jaipur or Lost Cities and though it is as long or longer than Battle Line it lacks that depth and depends much more on luck. 

I plan to try this again after taking out the animal and gaurd cards. We shall see how it goes after that.

Jambo is a very good economic game.  I tend to shy away from economic games because usually they are best with more than two, but since Jambo is designed to be played with only two, I thought I'd give it a try. I love the way that the players trade goods amongst themselves as well as with the supply.  It makes the game quite interactive.

***Update***

I don't play Jambo very often because I find it less compelling than the other Kosmos two player games that I own.  It suffers from randomness in a way that is detrimental to play.  While there are a lot of ways of making your opponent do the work for you and attempting to use your action points the most efficiently, I find it kind of boring.  Don't get me wrong, I'd rather play Jambo than many other games.  But it is too heavy for what I want it to be, and too short to bear its heaviness.  I know that is a strange thing to say since I love a good short but heavy game, and I love randomness, but Jambo is random in a distasteful way.

A tactical card game, in which you are an african trader. The cards are very beautyful. My only problem, that the two player have a common deck (quite a big one), so any strategic play is almost impossible. Luck plays a big role here, but for me it's not a problem, so I like this game.

This game has simple rules, beautiful artwork on the cards, and engaging play. It is an excellent filler for two players, taking well under an hour. It has some depth once you become familiar with the cards and strategy. It's a good travel game too, because it packs up small. Its biggest flaw is that you're helpless if the luck of the shuffle leaves you with no wares cards.

This game seems complicated at first, but trust me: it's very easy to pick up. There are several strategies to learn along the way, but it's very clean and straightforward. I love it.

Edit: The more I play this, the more I like it. The only thing I would change is the ratio of ware cards to everything else. It seems like all of those people / animals / utilities make it almost so that trading wares is not the focus. (I concede that I may be dense enough to be missing something. Anyone care to explain?)

The more you play this game, the more fun it becomes - as you begin to know what cards to expect, when to go fishing for something to help your situation and what value the wares might garner.  Even with the learning curve, this is still a fun game and might be my favorite for two right now.

I just played for the first time in about a year today, and my opinions hold - I got to get this to the table more often.

For very few rules there is some meat to this game.  The animal cards a literally vicious and can create a take take kind of feel.  This didn't go over great with my wife as I had a really good run of animals that crippled her.  With that being said this needs some plays to get use to the cards and how they interact.  Expect around two hours for your first play but I bet an hour is more normal with experienced players.  I enjoyed this game and am excited to explore it more.  I just hope my wife is willing to give it a few more tries as I still think it could grow on her.   This is one of those games that I think my rating could rise with more plays.  We will see.

The first time that I played this, I thought what others have thought: the game is playing me.  But on the second play, after being a little more familiar with the cards, this is a great 2 player game.

This is an excellent game. It is a short game (45 min) that feels like a big game. There are many strategies and opportunities to do different things on every turn. Your goal is to buy and sell wares to obtain the most gold. It has a bit of a learning curve as you discover how different card combinations work together but it is very enjoyable playing as you learn. It is card driven so it is susceptible to a luck factor. It remains enjoyable though as you try to maximize your opportunities and minimize your opponent's progress. Our favorite of the Kosmos two player games.

I'd heard so much about this 2 player game that I knew I was going to have to play this eventually. It's been out of print and extremely hard to find. I ran across a reasonable priced copy and was extremely excited about it. I got to play with both expansions and I will really miss the huts since I only have the base game. Hopefully, the popularity of this game will have the expansions come back at some point. This was such a fun action point allowance game. There's trading and set collection to try to earn the money needed to win. It lived up to the hype and plays fast to be something my wife would be more likely to agree to play.

Jambo has fully earned its reputation as a 2 player classic.  Although there is interactions between the players, it is relatively gentle.

Clearly the special powers are the spice to the game.  The set collection part by itself would have been boring and unoriginal.  Like potatoes cooked Indian style (aloo masala), Dorn was able to take something a little bland and dress it up in a way that creates taste, not by masking the 'potato-ness', but by accentuating what is good about the humble potato.  Perhaps this is what distinguishes the game from other CCGs--instead of spicing the chili to the point where you can't taste anything else but spices, Jambo uses the spice to accentuate the core ingredient.

Just like Indian cooking, I'm finding myself at a loss to pinpoint any one reason why it's so good, as it seems to be just the right combination of many ingredients.  Fun tactics, a little "take that" fun, emotional choices.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Jambo is a fantastic two-player romp; an outstanding contribution by Rudiger Dorn of Istanbul fame. There is little deep strategy here, but the simple ruleset and abundance in card variety allow for some clever plays and tightly-wound matches. Forget Jaipur--Jambo is king when it comes to two-player trading games. With equally matched players, you are never truly safe in victory, as Dorn cleverly employs a rule that places the onus upon the victor to truly cement their standing on top.

Jambo's strengths are driven by the action limitations, forcing you to weigh your options and challenge your creativity to find optimal lines of play. If you plan well, you never really feel like the randomness in the card draws spin your game out of control, simply because of your myriad of options to draw and/or mulligan cards or to trade/steal/replace goods. The game lends itself to further replays in that sense, as familiarity with the deck will simultaneously give you more *chances* at successful plays, provided you assess your risks wisely. The cards in the expansions already add to what is a magnificent game.

(+) High player interaction, driven largely by the cards.
(+) Action limitation forces players into meaningful junctions. This gives the game a real arc that ebbs and flows that enlivens the experience.
(+) Wide card variety that give plenty of options each turn, and lends to an emergent metagame with multiple plays with the same person(s).

(-) Requires multiple plays to truly appreciate and glean card combinations from the deck.
(-) Expansions are a must to add to the longevity of the game (though the base should last you quite a while).
(-) Out of print.

Cooled on this one. Found better hand management games.

Very nice.  It's this >< close to being my ultimate game.  Well, actually, a little farther than that.  If it wasn't about trading, if it wasn't so fiddly, if it didn't have such an open-ended game end condition (meaning the game won't end unless a player actually forces it to), if it had a more appealing theme, this would be ultimate.  As it is?  Still pretty darn sweet.

A very simple two-player game that's practically a card game with some added bits.  Players collect sets of goods for a price, then try to sell them for a higher price.  Along the way, they play various cards on each other to mess up the process.  Theme is light, but interaction is lively and fun.  I enjoyed my first play!

So, I'm trying to justify playing this over other games that involve card powers (RftG, Glory to Rome, Innovation), but I can't because it feels like the card powers are neutered as there are only a few worthwhile synergies.  

The trading mechanic is enjoyable, and the art is superb.  I still enjoy the game, but it's not worthy of holding any of the 3 previously mentioned games' jockey straps.

Really glad I found this at a second hand bookstore. My wife really likes Bazaar so I thought this would kinda be a step above. While it is more complicated than Bazaar, my wife still saw the similarity and enjoyed it. My favorite part of the game is that your money is also your victory points. Overall, I'm pleased with this purchase and can't wait to get this to the table time and time again.

Two Player Value = Excellent. This could be the best two-player game ever made.  However, it is important to note that Jambo is substantially better with the expansions and this claim is made while using both expansions.


Jambo is easily one of the best competitive two-player games ever made.  This game has a wonderful design and a simplistic beauty that makes the game a joy to play.  

Jambo is quick to learn and even a new player will find it easy to pick-up the game and play with no issues.  That makes this game highly accessible to everyone.

Jambo is nearly completely card driven.  Players draw cards from a central deck.  These cards handle everything in the game and have a variety of functions.  Cards are used as tools and give continual abilities to help the player.  Cards are used as people and animals to attack the other player or provide single use abilities.  Cards are also the wares that are bought and sold.

Jambo runs on an action point allowance system.  Each turn the player has a set number of actions to utilize in whatever fashion he sees fit.  It is this mechanic that both powers the game and makes it so much fun to play.  How each player uses their actions each turn makes the difference in the game.

Jambo revolves around a very simple open-market economy.  Buying and sell wares is the bases of the game.  The first player to amass a set amount of money wins.  This is very simple, yet works extremely well with the other abilities the cards offer.

However, the base game does suffer one major draw back; the lack of sufficient market cards. Not having enough market cards does cause the game to slow down unnecessarily.


Pros - 
- Easy to teach and learn
- Great introduction economic game
- Good Point Allowance mechanic
- Excellent use of activated card abilities

Cons - 
- Not enough market cards in the base that cause the game to slow down
- "Supply" card is a little too powerful and can help you win the game quickly by digging out the market cards.

**It is important to note that when the first expansion is added to the base game that the game makes drastic changes for the positive. The first expansion does wonders to correct the flaws in the base game and adds new victory conditions.

**I have rated this game based on playing with the expansions included which greatly help correct the flaws of the base game and make the game a much better overall experience.


[b]------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/b]


Here I will discuss the first Jambo expansion, somewhat boringly called,  [thing=29510][/thing].

Although the name might not be highly imaginative, this expansion does much to improve the base game and correct the flaws that exist in it.

Of importance to note is that I strongly urge using the designers recommend card supply with this expansion.  Rudiger Dorn suggests taking a few cards out of the base game and the expansion and not using them to help the proportion of wares cards versus other cards.  This works wonders and helps balance the game a bunch.  

The file for the Rudiger Dorn recommend cards to use is here - http://files.geekdo.com/geekfile_download.php?filetype=application%2Fpdf&filename=Jambo+Expansion.pdf&filecode=2zjiilsd7u&validationcode=cc35fdc001a6c19c648e64294db7441d

The files says - 


Rudiger Dorn Reccomendation:
Remove the following cards from the basic deck:
1 x Small Market
1 x Lion
1 x Ape Elephant 
1 x Snake 
1 x Crocodile
1 x Hyena
1 x Mask of Transformation 
1 x Kettle
1 x Throne
1 x Drums
1 x Well
1 x Scale
1 x Boat
1 x Leopard Statue 
1 x Carrier 
1 x Portuguese 
1 x Cheetah
2 x Traveling Merchant 
2 x Arabian Merchant 
2 x Rainmaker

The following cards from the expansion are NOT included in the newly formed deck:
1 x Artist
1 x Crystal Staff 
1 x Horn of Plenty 
1 x Shepherd
1 x Chamaeleon 
1 x Fennec
1 x Mangbetu Warrior


Several of the new cards, the new utilities, animals and people cards, are nice and helpful.  Nothing of overwhelming awesomeness, but good solid additions to the game.

The exclusion of the above mentioned cards, and inclusion of the new cards, goes a long way toward improving the problems of the base game.  Finding wares cards is now easier.

However, most noteworthy in this expansion are the two new mechanics; Huts and Relics.

Huts offer the players three new action choices during their turn.  The new actions are great additions and help the players greatly.  These huts allow the player to: 
- Set a certain good to buy that good for less yet sell it for more
- Trade any two goods for any one good
- Draw three cards and keep one of them

The single best new mechanic is the use of Relics.  Collecting all the Relics is a new victory condition and truly gives the players new strategy.  This greatly changes the base game  as it becomes much more strategic.    Obtaining Relics is triggered by fulfilling certain requirements during your turn.  Collect all four Relics and you win.

Because this expansion does so much to change and improve the base game, I feel I should re-score the game using this expansion.


Overall Playability = 8.0

Strategy = 8

[b]------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/b]


Here I will discuss the second Jambo expansion [thing=46127][/thing].

Once again the name is less than stellar, but this expansion truly makes the game stellar.  The second Jambo expansion finishes off perfecting the base game.

The biggest advantage of the second expansion is the additional wares cards.  With the new wares cards the ratio of wares to other types of cards is finally balanced correctly.  This makes the game much smoother and simply more fun to play.  This also bring more strategy to the game as now a blitz economic victory is viable against the Relic victory.  

Also added to the game is a new type of hut which expands on the huts from the first expansion.  These huts use wares to cancel the effects of people and animal cards.

Additionally a new mechanic is used, called Rugs.  The three Rugs are shared by both players and each hold one ware in players play area.  At a cost of one action the player can spin one Rug and use the ware on the others players side of the Rug.  This is a fun and risky new mechanic.

Overall, I feel that with the second expansion included the base game should be re-scored.

An excellent two-player game, with interesting choices galore, pleasing artwork, and just enough gotcha-type interaction to prevent it being two-player solitaire.

Really cool trading game. Reminded me a lot of At the Gates of Loyang, which was actually made years after this, so I guess Loyang reminds me of Jambo. Jambo is a lot simpler and much more streamlined than Loyang though. It seems almost as if Uwe was like "wow, I really like this Jambo game, I think I'll change the theme to a Cube Pusher standard, needlessly complicate the rules ad slap my name on it as designer!"

I'll give Loyang one more chance, but most likely it's going on the Trade List.

Endlich mal geschafft zu spielen. Ich war überrascht, dass es nicht Teil der Kosmos-Zweispieler-Reihe ist, denn in der typischen kleinen Box steckt ein ausgefuchstes Zweispielerspiel mit überraschend viel direktem Konflikt. Der clevere Einsatz von Tierkarten kann so manchen Plan zunichte machen und sorgt dafür, dass hier durch glückliches Kartenziehen nicht automatisch ein uneinholbarer Vorsprung entsteht. Schönes Spiel also, das sich natürlich noch dem Langzeittest unterziehen muss.

Very chaotic with the card actions able to ruin any planning. Some of the cards are very powerful while others aren't powerful at all - this lack of balance is disconcerting. You can hoard good cards or wares ready for a big play if you know the cards affecting these have been played, but that requires a high level of familiarity with the card deck. There are a few important decisions to be made here and there, but overall the game seems to play itself based upon the cards you've drawn. I've enjoyed the games though, mainly because there's always been the opportunity to try new things.

A clever action point/combo building card game. I typically don't like action point games but here I think it's ok. I'd never want to play this with an over-analyzing opponent as the game presents a good number of decisions per turn on what card to keep and what to play/activate. There's a market here that somewhat feels similar to Bazaar, while feeling like less of a puzzle.

The card art is gorgeous. At first I thought the luck factor in this game might be a problem, but after getting my patootie kicked by a heavy M:TG player I realized there was plenty of strategy I just wasn't seeing. Using cards in combination is the key. Utility cards are very powerful because you can have up to three in play and reuse them. Animal cards are the primary way of slapping your opponent, which is why it's good to have a Guard card in hand. People cards are often beneficial to both players. Playing an animal card right after a people card to mitigate the benefit to your opponent is one common combination.

UPDATE: 7 is just too low. It's a fun card management game with a good theme.

Jambo is a highly tactical hand management card game with a light, attractive, appealing theme. The object of the game is to accumulate 60 or more gold by buying and selling different goods at your market stand. There are 6 different types of goods in the game. There are cards with 3 goods or 6 goods on them, you play these cards to either buy the goods depicted (at a low price) and add them to your stand, or sell the goods depicted (at a higher price) and remove them from your stand. You want to set up combos where the goods you buy are also on the other cards you have so that you can sell the goods later. This is the heart of the game, and the part I most enjoy. Beyond buying and selling, there are also People, Animal, and Item cards. People and Animal cards are like event or instant cards in CCGs, they are played to enact their card text and then they are discarded. The people cards tend to be mutually beneficial events, while the Animal events tend to be used to attack the other player in some way. The Item cards are like permanent cards in CCGs, they are played to the table and remain there (unless the other player steals them or forces them to be discarded by playing Animal cards).

It's a fun, light game with an engaging theme, set-collection, combo-building, and a bit of take-that. I like it a lot.

 I am not quite as excited about this game as I want to be.  I keep feeling like my hand gets clogged with cards I don't want, and when I finally get the goods I want I lose them some how.  I like the concept, but the game has not played as fluidly as I would like.

Edit - and indeed it did! And gone up in rankings deservingly.  Not HEAPS of interaction still, but there is a lot more to be had from this game than what you get after the initial plays, once you know what cards are out there etc.

Fun for what it is: chaining together huge card combos each turn. But the excessive card text bothers me, and it seems more like a get-lucky-draw-good-cards-and-feel-good-chaining-them experience, than a straight-up cutthroat 2-player game with nifty interaction. Still, good to play with somebody who is not overwhelmed by card text, and the game has a very strong trading-card-game feel.

I really like what this game seems to offer.  My first play only got about a quarter of the way through, but I love the mechanics.  VERY much looking forward to getting it on the table again soon with a more mature player who can appreciate all of the nuances that this game has to offer.

I was able to play this again with a mature opponent and had fun with it.  You can't wait around for buy/sell combos or you will get left behind.  The theme meshes very nicely and it's a very enjoyable card game with more depth than you would think on the surface.

I have amended my rating based on the fact that the game can occasionally take much longer than what it should for what it is.  Still a fine game, tho.

I found this game to be really interesting to play.  Unfortunately, it was not what I really expected.  I thought that trading was going to be a more impoprtant part of the game than it turned out to be.  That is fine, as I said, I like the game and would happily play again.  The only other "negative" is that it also took longer than I expected.  Overall, though, still a positive experience.  [11/18/2008]

It's a game about making combinations while including some take-that cards which you can also ignore (depending on gaming style of the pair). Illustrations are neat, though the game is not terribly thematic. The way the game is structured it feels like MtG light sans the conflict. I like Settlers of Catan card game better (even if its longer).

Edit: Played Jaipur. Waaay better. This seems too complex and convoluted for it's own good. 
Edit 2: And I don't like Jaipur.

Simple 2p game with several viable strategies (partly given by the card draw). I like that some of the animal cards work as good reset, therefore a bad start does not need to kill the game due to bad starting hand.

At its core, players use cards to buy, then sell wares off for a profit. The rest of the deck offers ways to draw into more cards, get more wares or otherwise engage in a little take that with your opponent. 

There is a light CCG feel here due to the unique card effects, but combos happen purely by chance since players are merely working with what has been drawn. Consequently, getting card advantage is paramount. The decisions are fairly straightforward, although finding the optimal sequence of play can occasionally take time if one's hand is sizeable. While not terrible, this is a bland exercise of a game.

This game will play differently each time and therefore challenges the player to think tactical and to evaluate his ressources. The take-that-element loosens up gameplay and thusly opens up room for great interaction and simple fun.
The expansions brings it to a higher level and can turn it into an involved experience.

[8 plays] Another very well done Kosmos 2 player. I think it is pretty clever and packs quite a bit of interesting options into the small box. Like all card games, there is significant luck dependence sometimes (why can't I draw any goods cards?), but this is an engaging and fast moving game with interesting choices on almost every turn.

Most recent play (including expansion) 8-8-10 with Garrett.

Kniza tried it with Blue Moon and Scarab/Minotaur Lords, Moon and Weissblum with Das Amulett. Well, this is Dorn's MtG-type game complete with instants (animal, guards), artifact (utilities) and Mana (Your 5 APs). There's even hand damage and draw mechanisms! Only thing missing is the direct creature combat! 

The game can take awhile but it's satisfying and feels fluid. I love how the cards combine into good 'combos'. A solid 2 player game. Not maybe we could combine 2 decks to make it 4 player?

Fairly light game and unfortunately there's not much of anything exciting. I was hoping for a cool trading/bartering/scheming type of game, but with the MILD player interaction there is just too much time spent hoping to draw the right cards.  It seems the entire game is about 85% luck of the draw and 15% strategy in using what you have.  Everytime we've finished playing this game I've always felt a sense of "blah".  That's it?  Very little in the fun factor department for an hour long game.

RATING: 8
There's plenty of randomness, which is good for games with the spouse, but there's also many tough decisions to make; and even a little long-term strategy.  The downside is that it takes a couple games to "learn" the cards.  Once again, this makes it ideal for making a regular game with your s.o as opposed to an irregular game with your game group.

Az egyik legjobbnak tartott kétszemélyes játék kicsit csalódás volt számomra a Jaipur után. Annál kicsit nehezebb a szöveges lapok miatt, több taktikázásra ad lehetőséget, de szerencse szerepe semmivel sem kisebb. Az árukkal való feltöltés és eladás, ötletes, jó mechanizmus. A szöveges lapok felhasználásainak módja, az 5 akció szintén tetszett. A bajom, hogy a szöveges kártyák nagyon aránytalanok. Van köztük nagyon erős és gyenge is. Emiatt nem mindegy, hogy kihez kerülnek. Soknak is érzem a szöveges kártyák számát, én csak párat raktam volna be közülük. Amivel még gondom volt a plusz árusítóhelyek megszerezése. 5 darab van a játékban és akár egy félhez is kerülhetnek, ami után a másik félnek esélye sincs. Én ezt biztos korlátoznám valamilyen szinten. Nem rossz játék a Jambo, és kiegyenlítettnek is tűnik mégha nagynak is érzem benne a szerencse szerepét, de semmiképp nem nyűgözött le, de nem feltétlenül utasítok vissza vele partit.

Admittingly, I usually don't like games that rely on cards that have a bunch of crap on 'em.  The have a tendency to feel random, and while there is the nice card combo powermove fun, there rarely is any defense or planning for those kinds of moves.  I was excited about Jambo for two reasons (one because of Herr Dorn, and two because it seemed more like an economic game).  Sadly, it just felt like a lot of work and the economics were on a back burner to the cards with a lot of crap on 'em.

There's a lot going on in this one, especially for a small-box two-player game.  The complexities and interactions o the cards almost make it feel like a CCG, and the market/wares aspects give it an economic basis that I like a lot.  Added bonus: shouting "Jambo!" often, even when playing a different game.

One playing left me underwhelmed. There are really two different games here: the buying and selling game, and the MtG-like game of throwing special powers at one another. The latter detracts from the former, and without a coherent game system you are left with just a pretty collection of cards.

It is a nice enough game, but after repeated plays my interest is fading. It's too dependent on the card draw. Game play is oppurtunistic instead of tactical.

1 play, at feuerteufel.nl. 

Difficult to play this without being able to read the card text (all in Dutch at that site!), but at least I had translations available; it was enough to at least get a feel for the game ... and I think I like it! It vaguely reminds me a bit of Babel (where you have to play the cards as they come up, trying to create combinations that work to accomplish what you want) and the deck-building games (you are essentially creating a deck, with limited card pulls and a limited number of utility cards in play). Like other deck-builders and CCGs, it would help to know (at least generally) about the card distribution in the shared deck. 

May have to get a copy!

--- Summary ---
Start with 20 gold and 5 cards in hand. Cards are either utility cards, wares (combos of 3-6 goods on a card; you buy these for a low price, placing goods in your market spots, or sell for the higher price), animals (attack other player) or people (usually help you somehow, or maybe start an auction for cards/goods). Each turn, get 5 actions (each buy/sell/use card is an action); get money for unused actions (max 2/turn?). First player to get to 60 gold wins.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Limited strategy. Either you wait until you have cards you can use together in your hand, at which point the decisions are obvious, or you play speculatively and the game becomes quite luck-dependent.

Neat game.  This is an engine building game, buying and selling goods for profit.  Key to this game is clever use of card combos to efficiently utilize your turn actions.  My wife loathes this game.  It has cost benefit analysis and efficiency, two things she hates.  My oldest liked this game.

Totally get what people say about this saying it's a deeper game than you'd think for a small box card-game... and there's definitely interest there in combos of cards. I do feel that it's actually a bit slower than I'd have thought to get your money up... might be doing something wrong and just be a bit crap at the game, I suppose, but it just feels slower and more luck-driven than I thought it'd be. Def. warrants more playing.

EDIT: Jan 2010 comment above about warranting more playing - I'm not so sure. Liz and I tried this recently without the annoying (for her) animal cards, and it probably lost something and became just a bit boring. Not sure it does now warrant more playing...

This is a great two player game!  The combination of cards and action points (with a built in incentive not to use all of them) and the higher cost to the player that buys the first extra stall are just two of a host of tense decisions offered by this game.  Moreso than many card games, luck can be mitigated by skillful play, and scores tend to be close, making each individual choice that much more important.  I will gladly play this, any time, and I'm looking forward to playing it with the expansions.

Ugh.  How on earth has this game gotten such high ratings here on BGG?  I guess I just really do detest card games.  A game that comes down to drawing the right combination of cards just is not fun for me, even if there is a bit of strategy involved.  One thing that Jambo seems to need is a lot more goods cards, including some that have different numbers of goods.  To be fair, my wife is in the majority of people who seem to really like this game.  But for me, playing it is a painful experience and I always end up anxiously awaiting the ending.

Last night I couldn't get it out of my head after my third playing ended with a victory in the one-last-chance round where the comeback player won by matching the other player's 69 gold (or popcorn -- we haven't decided for sure what currency this economy is really based on).

RATING: 7.5
[RGG 2004 edition] {Africa, economic, couple; commodity speculation, action-point, drafting, utility cards} Jambo is my favourite 2p game. It's a challenging commodity speculation game and is always exciting - the final score won't differ much in most games. 

Jambo is an optimization game, in which players have to use the fewest actions to make money. Thus, a player must get good value from every action. It's better to have more (>6) cards in hand. Thus, a player has to build up his hand fast: well, supply, scale and some people cards. It's easy to lose without enough cards. 

I like to play utility cards in the table as soon as possible, no matter if they can be used. Utility cards are important - using them smartly lead to winning and I always try to acquire either Boat or Leopard Statue. People cards are also useful. They provide many tactics and should be used. I only occasionally use Animal cards and am still learning how to use them effectively. The warez card is the cornerstone of winning. It's better to keep at least 3 warez cards in hand. I occasionally build the small market. It's not a must and if a player can use all other cards wisely, he needs not the small market.

The components in the game are effective.  The illustration is nice.  There are too many texts on the cards, players need a few games to learn the cards.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I enjoy the ware management (what to buy, what to sell). Plenty of interesting choices. Each turn changes based on which combination of cards are drawn, and because each card has utility, luck of the draw is very manageable. It has the good card interactions of a CCG without all of the CCG hassle.

Replayed recently and the game has gone down in my estimation. The problem is that the game feels too lacking in tension or dynamics for repeated plays. It needs some kind of feedback to make getting those last few points really difficult, or to allow a player in the lead to close the game quickly. As it is it feels like a slog with no real early, middle or end game. Traded away in June 2014. Likely will not play again.

Dorn is probably my favorite game designer as Traders of Genoa and Goa are two of my absolute favorites, but this one doesn't do it for me.

It's very pretty and there are some fun interactions, but something feels weird about going from 20 to 60 for a win.  Also, Tribal Elder seems like a broken card to me. (For Magic fans, it's like Ancestral Recall for 5 cards instead of 3, and, by the way, I do not agree that this game feels like Magic.  I would certainly rather play Magic.  In fact, for people who complain that Magic is no fun with starter decks only, this has much less going on than even that.)

An economic game, where you manipulate your money and goods tokens with cards. There are a lot of inventive card effects, but at heart it's still a set collection game (like Ticket to Ride), just with more sizzle. I do have some some concerns about how meaningful the decisions in the game are; mostly you just play what you draw and hope to draw something good. Also, it's a shame that this is just a two player game - If I'm playing a two player game, I'd really rather be playing Magic (or something with more conflict).

My wife and I had a good time playing this while watching movies.  I bought the expansions and messed up the fun we were having.  After fixing it by thoroughly weeding through all the extras we played it a little.  It's enjoyable and mellow.  It has been on the shelf for a bit now, though.  I 'd like to convince her it's not broken soon.

update : Have played it more recently and had fun.  We did not play with the huts or carpets but did play with most expansion cards.

Also Expansions:
1 & 2

Update : Jambo is rapidly losing ground.  It just does not offer enough to consider playing again.

Having now played both, I am confused by the comparisons between Jaipur and Jambo. While both are nominally trade games only Jambo is actually using that mechanic as the main game experience while Jaipur is really more of a trick taking game. We like both and both satisfy different gaming experiences but I would say that Jambo has more depth.

Really nice game. The score is usually close, so everything is important. You have only one path (buy low, and sell high), but diferent ways to claim that path. 

Very interesting is the end of the game. When someone reaches 60 points, than the opponent has his last round. When the second player beats or reaches the score of the forst player, than he wins. So usually you don`t want to end the game, you want be the second, who makes a big jump.

Like every card game it could be luck dependent, but i think usually the player who plays better, will win. You have some decissions.

Played this with my wife and thought that it was pretty flat. 1 card income per turn seemed way too slow for me, and given that you need special cards to increase your card income means that you need to be lucky to pick those cards. I much prefer San Juan over this.

20-08-08: Played this another 2 times with Cynthia. This time, things went smoother, but we still felt very restricted in what options we had. Most of the game was spent drawing a card and trying to make the best out of it. If you drew good cards, then you win. Very luck-of-the-draw. I'm selling this game.

Really fun game, especially after a few plays when you know all the cards. Every turn is a new puzzle, trying to find the best way to use the actions you are allotted. In every game you will probably have to take a few big, exciting risks. Fair amount of luck, as card games tend to have, but still a very interesting game.

Got both expansions which has revitalized the game. I don't play with the extra markets and rugs and stuff, just the extra cards.

I bought a german copy - just so I could get both expansions. Now I am hoping to find players who won't mind the german. Otherwise it seems a bit silly..

..And now I have translated the basic cards to danish and played the game. It is a bit shorter than I thought it would, and feels more like a race to the goal of 60 gold. It is sort of almost in between being a filler and being a light game.

Update: Rune has played with me, and wants to try if we can't play with the german cards. We will do that next time. I like the expansion cards!

Really enjoyed our first game of this, though I'm not sure it will get played often - partly due to it being 2 player only, and partly due to the fact it took us way over the quoted time to play it. That might be due to the sheer amount of card reading involved, however - that shouldn't be an issue after you're used to the actions of the cards. I'm looking forward to giving it another try.

Traded away. Very nice 2 player economic game. Good theme of trading, but in precolonial Africa. I didn't keep it because I didn't enjoy the small gains of buy and sell and prefer a game with a build up over time, such as San Juan. Rachel may want it back sometime though.

Back on my wantlist now that it has been awhile and also want the expansions. Also some variants such as counting your own actions and using a shared pool of gold.

Traded.  Rating is based on one play with my girlfriend.  It played ok, but there was a lot of reading of cards involved, which took something away from it.

Jambo presses the limits of just how much 2-player game can fit into a Kosmos small box.  There is a lot here and Jambo almost demands a larger presentation and better components.  But this is a compliment to the game itself, which is enjoyable and substantial.

RATING: 7
This is a unique 2-player Euro that allows for plenty of take-that style interaction.  The tension really ramps up as the end-game approaches with neither player wanting to cross the finish line unless they're sure the other won't steal the victory in a photo finish.  The game also offers enough depth (or at least it seems to after a handful of plays) that repeat plays between the same players should be rewarding.

Actually a pretty decent 2P game.  Manages to jam all kinds of decisions into a pretty short timeframe.  Some of the animal cards seem tacked on to create interaction.  Can be a little tough to set out with any kind of strategy until you play it a couple of times.  Still, I'd rather play this than Lost Cities or Balloon Cup.

UPDATE:  Uh oh, my wife does not like this at all.  Not sure what she really dislikes about it, but she sure does not like it.  

My take:  Surprisingly, it is kind of clunky.  It is also kind of murky for such a simple game.  Hard to pin down, but it just does not seem to flow all that well.  These things surprise me as Rudiger Dorn is normally one of my favorite designers (Traders of Genoa, Goa, Arkadia, Louis XIV).  Hmm.

Great game, and the expansions really make it even better.

Update: Lowering my rating a little. I love the gameplay, but there are too many turns where you just can't do much because you didn't get the cards you need. Sometimes you've got people cards that help you sell wares more efficiently, but you don't have any wares. Sometimes you've got a few different ware cards but none of them match up. Sometimes you just don't draw any artifacts, so you're options are even more limited. The expansions help with these problems but they also create a huge draw pile that is a pain to shuffle.

I got this out on a flight with my wife. We got it set up, rules explained, and a couple turns in and were then cut short. It was a good teaser and made us realize there's some decent game here. We want to get it out again soon...

It takes a few plays for the qualities of this game to shine through. The first couple of times we played, we were more interested in finding wares cards and were frustrated by the number of utility, people, and animal cards we were drawing. However, the meat of the game is in knowing the abilities of these cards and their combinations. Initial rating of 7.

10 plays: It's a pretty decent game but new layers haven't yet been revealed after 10 plays. Stays at 7.

Dorn doesn't get talked a lot about much anymore, but he has designed a wide variety of very good games - Goa, Arkadia, Jambo, Las Vegas. There are others, but that runs a pretty nice spectrum from heavy to light and they are all well regarded. Is it too strong to say only Knizia and Chvatil have spanned the same gamut of good games at so many different weights? I guess Kramer might fit there too. I don't know, I'm just thinking out loud.

This game relaxes me.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 5
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 4
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 1
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 4

A really nice two-player that manages not to feel too abstract.  There's quite a variety of cards (even without the expansions) and games have felt different from each other so far, with some seeming really card-poor and others really goods-poor, both of which add a different kind of tension to the game.  I picked up the expansions since I like the original so much, but haven't played them much yet.

Nice 2 player game.  The cards are fun with plenty of variety.  A nice balance of luck and strategy, and the theme is great.  My wife doesn't enjoy it as much as I do, though, so we don't play as often as we might otherwise.  But when we do play, we usually get two games in.

RATING: 6
I'm a huge fan of much of Rudiger Dorn's work, particularly Louis XIV, Goa, Arkadia, and Traders of Geoa, but Jambo didn't live up to the high bar that Dorn has set for himself in my mind. It's one of the most widely lauded members of the Kosmos two-player series, but I'll still opt for Odin's Ravens, Lords of the Rings: The Confrontation, or Ubongo: Das Duell from that series. Jambo constantly felt like a process of taking two steps forward and one step back (or maybe three steps back), and thus overstayed its welcome. You're trying to make a set amount of money faster than your opponent, but true to the age old adage, you've got to spend money to make money, and in Jambo you've got to spend a lot of money to make money. You're buying cards that allow you to buy goods and then you're buying more cards so you can ultimately sell those goods, in the hopes that you've turned a bit of a profit in the process, but it's an incremental process that feels more painstaking than pleasurable.

I forbore to rate this until I played a second time, but the second game went much like the first - make obvious plays, accumulate gold, repeat until you win (both times I had experienced opponents, I should note).  In the second game I did stall for a bit due to not getting ware cards that matched up well, but since there wasn't anything I could do about it with the cards I had, that didn't lead to any actual decisions, or anything.

I would actually rate this lower except that it's short, and that optimizing the cards is kind of fun despite not being very challenging.

Great game with all of the depth of a typical CCG, but less luck dependent (and without the cumbersome deckbuilding). Played four times sofar, and although the theme does not appeal to me, already I feel like it is up there with the likes of Blue Moon, San Juan and Race For The Galaxy. Biggest advantage of this game is that it is very easy to explain and you rarely have to skip a turn waiting for new options.

Game is actually one of Dorn's best besides Goa. I really like this game. The concept of buying and selling goods with the same set of card play is quite unique and novel to me.  The learning curve is little steep though, with all the card text. I don't like some of the cards as they feel unbalanced (like the Portuguese). Overall, a good game that I don't mind holding on to it.

Card text is again the biggest barrier to newbies enjoying the game. Also way too many cards vs. wares. However, once folks get used to the terminology, the game flows quite smoothly. An excellent Kosmos 2-player series. Ranks right up there with Odin's Raven, Lost Cities.

A solid 2 player game. Nothing exciting but entertaining enough. Takes us around an hour. Sometimes we choose not to play any 'nasty' cards on eachother. Mind you, even the 'nasty' cards aren't too bad and you can collect guard cards to protect yourself from them. I like that flexibility.

Very, very clever and thoughtful trading/card combo game. You have four resources to manage: cards, goods, actions and gold (which is your final score). Your five actions per turn allow you to obtain cards (only one per turn, but you can use an action to draw another card if you're not happy with the one you've drawn - a very clever mechanic) and you use your cards to buy/sell goods as well as interfere with other players or give yourself special actions. Haven't played "properly" yet, as we didn't spend an action to play our utility cards before we used them (thanks Susan for the twitter).

Crafty and potentially vicious 2 player card game. Some of the animal/utility cards are incredibly powerful, but there's usually a counter somewhere in the deck. The game can drag a bit depending on how the ware cards are shuffled in, but usually it manages to maintain tension.

This is a fun game, play driven by the card draw, but lots of options each turn make this interesting with some skill definitely required.  A Rudiger Dorn!  An 8 for now, but might go up with the new expansion. The 3-player variant works very well with a extra copy of the large market card.  My wife really enjoys this one.  We have enjoyed this with the new expansion, also.

It's a good game.  I like how the winner isn't necessarily the player to get to 60 points first, but that the laggard gets a single chance to redeem himself.  It adds a push-your-luck kind of element to the game. Should you go out as early as possible, or should you wait until you can really smash the final round and make yourself uncatchable?  Good fun.

A competition between stall owners in an African market. Two-player card game using mechanisms similar to a CCG. The first player to earn 60 gold pieces wins. Due to the variety of cards, one becomes a better player through repeated play as interesting combinations are discovered. Overall, this is a pleasant 2-player game with interesting strategies and good re-play value. Light-medium weight, should take 30-45 minutes per game.

I like this game.  Lots of different ways to make points with good player interaction.  The art work is pleasing and the game components are good quality.  Though I wish the cards were made of a little thicker stock.  A minor gripe is that I wish the box insert was designed so the components would each have their own section rather than being all jumbled together.  Note to self *devise better storage solution*.

Currently this is my favorite 2 player game.  It never seems to get old.  It's an economic card game.  The goals is to turn 20 gold into 60 and you do so by buying and selling wares.  There are wide variety of cards which break down into 4 categories, ware cards for buying an selling, utilities which have once/turn abilities, people cards which are generally positive to the player, and animal cards which are generally negative to your opponents.  This leads to many, many different winning strategies.  The game has tremendous replay value.

A pleasant surprise.  Light, two-player fare isn't generally my favorite, but this one is pretty neat.  There's plenty of messing with the other player, and there's a neat game of getting wares into your stand, and trying to keep them there until you can get a card which allows you to sell them.  The trading is satisfying, even if it's not with other players, which was particularly surprising to me.  Finally, it's fast to play and easy to teach, which makes it ideal as filler for two-player gaming sessions.

At least two games years ago and one game recently. A good game, but with lots of different cards with English text makes it quite slow with new players.

Players take turns where they first pick-up cards and then play them, max 5 actions per turn. The first one to gather 60 golds wins the game. Player buy different kinds of merchandise and try to sell them - animal, human and utility cards help in this (or tease your opponent).

Можно было бы поставить 7/10, но что-то мешает. Игра скучновата. Комбинации карт бедноваты по сравнению с лучшими ККИ. Много рандома. Приход карт сильно решает. Удивляюсь, почему люди такие высокие бвллы ставят.
Арт прекрасный. Плиточки товаров мелковаты.
Еще минус - сильная зависимость от англ. языка.С русскими детьми не поиграешь. Да и при таком обилии игрового текста на картах можно было бы поинтересней геймплей сделать. Все сказанное без учета расширений, которые докупать не собираюсь.

Rüdiger Dorn (Traders of Genoa); Kosmos 2 player; Players take on the role of merchants offering their wares from market stands. On a player's turn, he has five actions to choose from. Actions can be used to draw cards, play cards and activate buildup cards. In order to sell wares, the merchants must first lay the wares out, since customers will only buy where all the wares they want are being offered. And since market space is at a premium, players have to think hard about which wares to offer.

The card combinations make it a game that's hard to judge off of one play, but I can see some potential here.  I like that the losing player has one last chance to win the game before it ends.  The Take That! elements of the game annoy me, but the heart of the game seems to be about manipulating your markets to make the most profit, and the Take That! elements only come into play if you rely too heavily on the special cards.  Manipulation of the markets is key, and a little tough to get the brain around the first few games.  I'm still not sure I know how best to do it....

I have a little trouble with games where a lot of the cards have special powers that I need to acquaint myself with. The box says 40 minutes, but our games are always more than an hour. Some of the games have been hopelessly one-sided, too. Perhaps with enough plays, my wife and I might be proficient enough to play quickly and combat terrible draws. I don't hate the game, but I doubt if I'll ever love it like some people do.

Jambo was a complete surprise for me. I noticed a friend raving about it in the comment section of his collection and then bought it a short time later when I stumbled across a copy hiding on a dusty shelf at my FLGS. The game does a great job of bringing CCG style card play to a small box, one-shot card game. There's plenty of player interaction, card combos and surprisingly, even an auction mechanism that occasionally pops up. 

It's a ton of fun and I'm glad I discovered it, even if I'm almost a decade late to the party...

Interesting mini-CCG (without the collectible part) card game that's really more like an Action Point game than a CCG. Nice dilemma each turn about which card to keep, and some engaging planning/scheming to get things right, and in the right order. Though I must admit that a lot of decisions are obvious.

Definitely a sense that this has been done before, but this is well done and nicely presented. One of the few Kosmos 2-player line that I've immediately liked without reservation.

I play Jambo with a house rule that every player starts out with one big and one small marketplace.

Jambo is een lekker vlot handelsspelletje voor met z'n tweëen.

Het doel voor de spelers is om zoveel mogelijk geld te verdienen met het inkopen en verkopen van goederen op hun marktkraam. Om dit voor elkaar te krijgen kunnen ze gebruik maken van allerlei mensen en voorwerpen om henzelf verder te helpen, maar men kan ook dieren op de andere speler afsturen om die dwars te zitten. Diegene die het meeste goud heeft verdient wint.

A good little card game that is a fantastic filler. Considering the box it came in, it sure would have been nice to have some way of storing the cards and bits better provided. 

As for the game itself, it's certainly very original and entertaining but like Magic:The Gathering, you feel there sure are a lot of subpar cards in there, which you never want to see or play.

However, the game is very balanced in my opinion and it's one of those where it can be very hard to win or lose by a lot, assuming both players are equally skilled, so luck isn't a huge factor in the games I've played so far, which is about 50.

Fun.  Easy to teach.  Cool combos.  Always close games.  Hmm...I don't know why, but I feel I should like this game more than I do.  

I like it, but it doesn't give me a 'wow' feeling.  Every game I play is close, no matter who I play with.  Combos can be awesome, but I wish there were a few more during gameplay.  

My favorite game was a few months ago with my brother.  It was his first game, so early on I took it easy on him.  As the game progressed, his understanding grew and he began building his gold up.

On his last turn he attempted a combo which I gleefully nixed with a card of my own.  After staring at his remaining cards for a few minutes, he unleashed an awesome combo that netted him about 20 gold.

He won the game and I couldn't have been happier.  THAT is the type of play I expected to experience EVERY game.  For me though, it was the exception.

I play this with my daughter and we both like it, both of us are learning combos, but gameplay--though close--is seldom tense.

A good game that I'll play at every request, but not one that I drool to play.  :)

010405 purchased. After my first game, I found that there were a rather a HUGE amount of options to consider, with the cards having a lot of different abilities which could alter your strategy. Utility cards are strong it seems. 
Graphically it is beautiful and it feels like one of the heavier two player kosmos game. very good. Initial rating so far of 7...likely to go up with further plays
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Don't be fooled by the market/resource theme and the "friendly" African tribespeople.  Jambo's goods-driven economy is engineered to support unfriendly poaching, forced discarding, utility card abuse, deck awareness, and action-management logic puzzles.

The resulting system is perfectly tooled, even if a few cards are over- or under-powered - the primary example being the Tribal Elder card, which is nearly broken.  It should have either been reclassified as an animal card (so that it might be Guard-countered), or its card-drawing effects should have been reduced.

I do enjoy the expansions and the host of new options that they present, although their inclusion makes the game into much more of a lottery - as you can no longer spin through the deck looking for the upcoming card that you know to exist.  Jambo + expansions = tactical goodness, whereas the original game - due to its limited cardpool - is much more strategic.

UPDATE: Playing with both expansions now and I am really enjoying it. Refreshes the game and I feel the 2nd expansion reduced card draw importance and focuses the game a card usage. With the expansions a solid eight.

Wife enjoyed Lost Cities, so I thought this might be a good fit.  She seems to like this one.  The first couple plays run a bit long due to the amount of text on the cards.  I suspect this will speed up with more plays and familiarity with the cards.

A fun, lightish, 2-player card game with board game elements. The lack of space on your market stalls forces you to think carefully about what to buy. I think the utility cards can really make or break the game, but there are a lot of options and possibilities.

Have a number of plays of this under my belt - another game that I play with my wife - good to travel with. Art is very well done - lots of cards - fun bits... quick play. Not one I would pull out often with my more hardcore gamer friends but a game that is easy to entice my wife into  playing so it gets a 6. I think there is an expansion out there for this - will have to look into that though the base game is good for lots of play before an expansion would really add anything vital.

UPDATE: There is more to this game then initially meets the eye. It can be very cut throat and challenging for more hard core games - more so then I gave it credit for. A good game to play when you are limited on time or between meatier fare.

This is another great game in the Kosmos 2-player series. It has plenty of theme (African traders) and some nice mechanics. Try it.... you won't be disappointed.

This was one of the key games if not THE key game that got me into gaming.  I love this game and so does my wife!  It's a great two player game that you will always want to go back to when you get free time. Loads of theme and light, yet rewarding strategy! A very interactive game.  I do recommend all expansions, as well as getting Asante!

A solid two player game.  Fast playing with a bit of strategy.  My wife doesn't care for the economic-side of it, but all-in-all a very good game, worth having if you play a lot of games just with 2.

Kind of ambivalent towards Jambo.  I like the card-driven mechanics, the different abilities in the various utilities, people and animals.  However, the core of the game, the buying and selling of wares, wasn't really enjoyable.

Jambo jambo...jambo!  I dig this game quite a bit.  Luck with the cards, yeah.  Small markets necessary?  Not really (I crushed my wife on last playing and didn't draw a single small market the whole game).  Interesting ebb and flow to the economy of goods, cards and actions.  Quite a cool little 2-player Kosmos game.

This one took awhile for me to warm to. The strategy was not apparent to me during first 2-3 plays. After that it clicked. Gets better the more you play it.

Traded Jambo, Pillage & Plunder, Reef Encounter and Tichu for Battlestations, Caylus, Facts in Five and NHL Ice Breaker. I have now reacquired this. 

Then, I traded Jambo, Medici and Strotzi, Dracula, and $100 for a complete 7th Continent.

My wife and I got this because it was focused on two players. We play often during lunch since I work from home. I really like that this game is easy to learn but has a lot of depth built into it. We've played about 20 times now and I keep learning new strategies for playing.

The first game takes a long time, and feels kind of awkward if you neither one have looked at the cards yet.  By the end of the first game, certain combos are self-evident, and you're ready to try it again.  (That's where I am, for the second time.  Rating still to follow!)

Excellent choice for a 2 player game. Can bring on some very tense moments. My only complaint is that we tend to need to account for turn actions at least once a game...i.e. "I did not just take 5 actions"! "Yes, you did" and thus the backtrack begins.

Jónak tűnik, frankó kis kétszemélyes játék. Eléggé egymásnak keresztbe tevős, máshogy nem lehet boldogulni, muszáj néha megszorongatni a másikat. A kártyák között sok az imba, de ez már csak egy ilyen műfaj, van szerepe a szerencsének. Az 5 akció jó és elég is, itt azért lehet taktikázni és "kombókat" összehozni.

After 10+ Plays: Seems a bit too luck driven.  I don't mind the randomness of the animals so much, but certain cards like the well provide a huge advantage every turn.  Also, it is very frustrating to never draw a small market stand, as you really nead at least one to have any chance.  The game is still generally fun, it's just that sometimes if you draw poorly you just have to sit there, doing nothing on your turns and waiting to lose.

Yay, really a good game. I have only one game under my belt but I really enjoyed it. The friend with whom I played already said that I am going to buy this game... ;)
Reminds me a bit of Magic but much easier to get. I didn't like some of the graphics but that's really something I can live with.

Updated to an 8. Very! good two player game. Played 10, maybe 20 games now and truly enjoy it more and more.

RATING: 9
The basic system of buying and selling would be really dry if not for the plethora of fun action cards. The game has a unique flavor and plenty of interaction.
Running low on cards and only being able to draw one a turn could be devastating. You should always have a way to draw cards besides the one at the beginning of the turn.

UPDATE: Bumped this up to a 10 from a 9 because of the expansions. They not only add variety but fix some of the minor problems I had with the game. Basically, every few games, a player would find themselves with few useful cards and no way to draw enough to come back. With some of the new cards and Huts, this is remedied.

Jambo is a pretty good representative of the German game phenomenon, scaled down for 2 players.  It's pretty enjoyable, and the animal cards allow for a nice amount of interaction with the other player.  All-in-all, euros do not seem to tickle my fancy unless they are designed by Reiner K., but Jambo does a pretty good job of holding up against my demanding gaming requirements.  Way to go, Rudiger!

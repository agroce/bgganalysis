The game deserves a 9 but in the first edition the Germans and Russians have the same color counters (How idiotic is that?).

got this v cheap for soloing (and then maybe playing on vassal) - waiting to free the table space so can get this learned and tried.  Little bit more set up than I would like but looks fun after that.

RATING: 6
I do like SCS, but it's less successful with the larger titles just due to the amount of downtime and lack of any player interaction in the sequence of play; I think SCS works best in games like Fallschrimjaeger. SP/SPII do have appeal, though, since there are so few games covering Operation Uranus in its entirety (why would that be, I wonder?). In total, I like it better than Drive on Paris, but neither tops my list of SCS titles.

Yes, I pre-ordered 2 copies of 1st edition SP, only to find it needed major revisions, and then they released the 2nd edition.  Anyone what 2 copies of 1st edition?  Fair warning:  the game doesn't work ...

RATING: 8
Medium heavy only because of fiddly set up and lots of high density counters. It is a fun game however...breathed life into the Stalingrad type games when it came out.

Only played once, solitaire, and did not finish it. Looks great, possibly too many counters. Rules aren't long, but verge on the fiddly side of things.

RATING: 7
I have the 2nd Edition. Good solid hex-and-counter fare. Huge density of units can make play difficult for those with fat fingers, especially near Stalingrad itself. Try and play two games at once so the inactive player doesn't fall asleep waiting for thier turn.

RATING: 8.5
I love trying to stem an offensive with scratch forces and this is a great situation. Determining where a stand can be made before attempting an almost certainly doomed counter-offensive is great. Much more enjoyable, of course, with the optional additional divisions presented on one of the Gamer's annual countersheets. Some great memories!

This is one of my favorite board wargames. It is a great game, an excellent simulation, with terrific production value. My only complaint is that it takes quite a long time to set up - but worth it.

Smooth, fast, and fun. Be sure you play with the original Standard rules, the Sequence of Play is different.

RATING: 6.5
Standard Combat Series (SCS) is a classic among hex & counter wargames, designed with simple rules and high playability. There are many different scenarios that cover a wide variety of battles/campaigns. I think that it is a valuable series, but when the density of counters is high, I do not like it so much. For example, in this title the size of stacks in and around Stalingrad are a bit uncomfortable to manage. Definitely I do not like the use of this system in "monster" games!

A good basic game on the most famous campaign from the eastern front of WWII. The Gamers imo never put out a bad game during the years when they were an independent game company. SCS is their series of basic operational level games...and I like them very much...great for beginners as well as Grogs looking for a lighter experience.

Played version 2 and liked it, just okay. This one I had problems with because the opening scenario setup doesn't quite make sense and there is no support.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A "10" because of the subject.  Not that the game system appeal to me to that full score extent.  The system is very suitable and adeuqate to portray this bloodiest struggle on the Eastern front without much brain-teasing-and-draining.  And yet, the game covers the campaign in a rather complete picture than the past efforts.  OOBs is fairly complete.  Maybe the rating goes down a bit after repeated plays.  As of now, a generous 10 first to Masahiro Yamazaki.

RATING: 6
OK little game, has the benefit (as the first SCS game) to need a minimum of special rules.  Also one of the better SCS games but set the tone for the series with the very (too) attacker friendly CRT.  Action is nice, but history is also nice.

This edition is flawed...the terrain and the OOB are downright weird in places.  The game system and countermix give a very cartoonish view of capabilities...so much so that this edition was plagued by variants, house rules, clarifications, and outright modifications (in various issues of Operations magazine).  The 2ed is much, much, better and should be sought out by all serious players.  If you have only this version it is good enough but not the real deal.

RATING: 7
This is a great game with a beautiful map.  I realy enjoyed the game system, and all the mechanics are very efficient and playable.  My only beef is that it's almost too unweildly and lengthy for solo play!  Not that that's much of a legitimate beef!  I'll set aside the quality time when I can!  Super game.

Good, but old game, needs to have bigger hexes and playing pieces.

RATING: 9
An interesting historical simulation that gives the player some idea of what the Germans were up against. The Russians don't have it all that easy either. Their HQs have to stay on roads, they move at a snail's pace, and if they're destroyed, goodbye offensive.

RATING: 7.5
Simply great. In the OCS tradition of easy to learn, fast to play, lot of enjoyment. Probably the funiest victory condition ever written. Do not miss them. A Masahiro Yamazaki design, so period.

Many seem to like both game and system. I am not very fond of either. Good idea for a game, but just felt fiddly when playing. Don't like the looks of the game either. Too garish.

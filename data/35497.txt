Educational without being overtly educational (educational games that are strictly educational tend to be poor games in general). This game is quite an exception, in spite of my initial skepticism. This has something for all ages, and provides for plenty of opportunities to score points -- even if you're not familiar with the animal in question.

You don't get stressed, neihter bored. In my opinion, the game is more about bets than what you know about animals (although it helps, of course). However, it is fun when everybody fails completely an animal and you go like: it can't weight so much!

Good trivia game that does not make it all about one answer as you can guess on a range of characteristics of an animal and the animal theme is one I like too. 

It also is actually educational as there are animals which I was sure were from one place and they turned out to be wrong. 

A learning experience that was truly fun and a ton of cards and too much to remember for good replayability and the game lasts just the right amount of time. 

Downside if the whole group is quiet, it is not really that fun but if you all are debating and making commentary about the animals it is highly recommended for sure.

 Juego sencillo y divertido. Hay que adivinar cuanto pesan, miden, habitat,... de cada bicho que sale. Es divertido con mucho. Creo que hay un problema de rejugabilidad si se juegan muchas partidas y se terminan aprendidendo de memoria los datos de cada bicho (algo así como el Trivial Pursuit).

As a regular game this is probably only a 5 or a 6 but because it's educational and plays fast with kids or adults, I like it more than it deserves. Simple gameplay, fun to learn and appealing art.

It doesn't deserve a 7 really, but I liked it enough that I wouldn't turn down a game.

Those who are rating this as a trivia game are missing the point entirely. Yes, the theme is animal trivia: but the player who knows everything about zoology isn't necessarily going to be the winner. The winner will be the player who is the better gambler (given the risk of losing betting cubes), and knows best how to psyche out his opponents! An awful lot of mind games going on here.

Friedemann Friese has done the impossible: he has made a "trivia" game not just interesting, but tense! Wits & Wagers is kinda of the unpolished version of Fauna, and Friedemann Friese has actually succeeded in what the former game failed to do.

Rengeteg a kártya, ami sokáig tartja újdonságként a játékot (ráadásul könnyebb és nehezebb oldaluk is van).
Ez aztán tényleg bárkivel játszható.

Another really fun betting game. It has a bit of a Wits and Wagers feel in it but it is much more skill based.

Rating went down after a couple of animals which had "Brazilian" or something like that and lived in one region giving the starting player a big advantage.

I win 75% of the time although usually there is at least one person playing who knows much more about animals than me. I am starting to have a feeling that the game is more about the skill of deciding were to bet first than actual knowledge.

Trivia about animal info. Our 12 year old does very well at this. There is some "gaming" it as you can put your markers in areas that are adjacent to as many other areas as possible to try to score some points. However, superior knowledge will win out every time.

Unlike most games like it, Fauna is a trivia game not only with a precise focus (animals), but a trivia game where you don't have to be right. Knowing exactly the weight of a kangaroo will get you pints in this game, as where knowing approximately in which regions one might find a naked mole rat. This mechanic of "points for being right AND for being close to right makes this trivia game what many aren't: FUN.

You know those days when you would go into a class in school and the teacher would have some "fun" activity planned. Obviously it was indeed more fun than sitting and listening while the teacher lectured for an hour, but it certainly wasn't an activity you'd choose to do in your free time. Well, that's the feeling I got from this game. Sure, it's moderately interesting to learn what regions of the world you can find a green turtle, but I don't exactly call it a good time. I've never really wondered the length of a leopard gecko's tail, therefore a game that focuses on facts like that is not my cup of tea. Now there is some strategy in the way you can place your betting markers, and even if only one player really knows animals you can kind of copy them for a chance at points. The problem is that, unless you're really into zoology, it just becomes a game of guessing and estimating. Also the graphic design on the board is very poorly done. Differentiating one region from another is not easy. My final assessment would be that Fauna is boring, not in a "I want to rip my hair out" way, but more in a "I guess I'll twiddle my thumbs" way. I really wanted to love Fauna because it offers an alternative way of playing a trivia game. Sadly, there was nothing more to it than the educational lessons and some random guessing. Oh, and it bears mentioning that in the short game we played, we found 2 game-altering typos on the cards.

(KIDS) Played a few times now and it reminds me of Wits and Wagers in how it turns a trivia game into a real game.  Knowing stuff helps and will probably get you the win if you know a lot more about animals than others.  At the same time, there are plenty of ways to use other tactics to score points.  It's well put together and also not a great game.  I may or may not keep it around.

This is NOT a kind of animal trivial pursuit, hell no!

It's a pity it is only in german, I need a spanish version.

Finally we have a Spanish Edition!

* Update *

I bought a copy for my family, specially my brother who loves nature, but he rejected playing it even not allowing me to explain him how to play. That made me so sad! I hope one day he realize how much wrong he was and agree to play Fauna.

* Update *

Strangely, nobody wants to play Fauna, I'm considering in trading it because I don't find sense in keeping the game unplayed for 10 years looking my childs to like it.

* Update *

Traded away! Who could imagine this when I purchased this game... Maybe when my children grow up I regret for have traded Fauna, but that will be several years from now.

Interesting 'party' game - where knowledge of animals is going to help considerably (although you can piggy-back off the expert a bit if you're stuck).

Like it - german language is a bit of a problem, but if the reprint is US with imperial measures then my kids will have a problem with that rather than the language, they've no idea of inches and pounds at all.

Production quality is above average and game has some depth. Obviously the one who knows animals best is strong in the game but not definite winner.

A great family game of "betting" on various animal characteristics.  Every round, an animal card is revealed, and players may bet on what part of the world the animal is native to, and its weight, height/length, and tail length, getting points for either being correct or close to correct.

It all sounds really boring, but I actually thought it was quite fun to try to guess all of these aspects, often for animals you have no idea about!  It's not often an educational game also manages to be fun, but I really had a good time playing this.

As far as trivia games go, this is one of the best ones.

The biggest flaw might be that it has a rich get richer aspect in that people who get more right answers, and more points, are more likely to have access to more guesses on the next turn and thus more capacity for points.

I played Fauna 5 times in the first three days, which is quite unusual for me; games are usually played only once or twice and then are put on the shelves for a long time as I have so many other games to play. But Fauna surprised my with its simple and quick gameplay. 

It’s a trivia game about animals. I’m not a huge fan of trivia games, but I don’t despise them either. They can be nice to play from time to time, especially with non-gamers or just when you don’t want to think too hard (i.e. like you do in a eurogame). I played it with my family, friends but mostly as a 2p with my wife, and on every occasion I’ve enjoyed myself quite a bit. It’s a very easy game to learn, and it’s always funny and interesting to learn about animals – where they live, how much they weigh and how long they are (with or without tail). It’s just a cosy and relaxing, educating game. 

Also, even if you don’t know for sure how heavy an a specific animal is, you can always try to estimate it, and due to the scoring system you are usually correct (except in the rare occasions when you are totally off!). Before I tried it I thought it seemed very harsh that you lose your “guessing cubes” when you made an incorrect guess, but if I e.g. guess that a cow weighs between 200-500 kilo, which is one of the possible options, I only lose my cube and gets no points if it weighs less than 100 and more than 1000 kilos. That’s a pretty safe bet I would say. If it weighs for instance 600 kilos, I get my cube back and get 3 points instead of 7 if my answer had been spot on. Oh, and speaking of this, I like that the English version of the map is double-sided with the weird inches, feet and pounds on the one side and then the much clearer and superior metric system and kilos… ;)

While the length/weight of an animal often isn’t too hard to estimate, the areas it inhabits can be much more challenging to find. However, most areas border several other areas, so once again it’s not too difficult – just like it should be. I have to say, though, that we’ve skipped some animals whose names are something like “Malaysian monkey” etc… And if an animal only lives in 1 area, there’s a good chance that this is Madagascar! Other than that, the variety of the animals is great.

All in all Fauna has been a success, and if my friend didn’t already own it (he went out and bought it after I played with him), I would probably buy it myself (edit: I got a good deal on the German copy (really not a problem), so I bought it!)). 
Fauna is so simple, quick and educational. However, I have to say that, yes, the replayability is probably somewhat limited due to the limited amount of animal cards, but if you don’t play it too often it should be fine. And every game I can get 10-20 plays out of before selling is definitely acceptable in my book!

RATING: 6
Fauna is the trivia game that I can tolerate. In fact, it's less comlicated than a gateway game... Fauna is even a game for non-gamers. And for that reason, Fauna fills an important spot in my collection.

What makes Fauna enjoyable is the "push your luck" aspect of cube placement. Every player has X number of cubes, and you can use those cubes to wager on various animal traits such as geographic location, height/length, and weight. You can play it safe, or you can extend yourself with your guesses. Guess wrong, and those cubes are "trapped" for a turn.

That's pretty much it. It's simple, it's effective, and animal triva works well for a very broad audience. Heck, you even learn a bit while playing. This will never be something I'm chomping at the bit to play, but given an audience with limited gaming savviness, I can always yank this one out.

Update: turns out my comments above are pretty accurate, but that observation of "I won't be chomping at the bit to play" meant exactly that... I simply wasn't excited to play this game. I'm playing other games with my wife and family, and there's not much of a need for a pure "nongamer's game." It's a good game, a good design, but one that I don't need to own.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Very simple yet addictive animal-trivia game, perfect for short -45 min- family plays. You don't need to know the exact answer as to where does an animal live, or how long it is, or how much does it weight. Instead, you guess categories (its mass between 10 and 20 kg, or its length between 50 and 70 cm) and the region(s) where it thrives.
This mechanism is much more useful for kids imho, for they learn estimating actual physical quantities, besides learning simple but accurate facts about animals.
A sure winner for winter family plays, or short adult plays alongside Ticket to Ride or Yspahan, in between playing El Grande, Puerto Rico, Agricola, Power Grid, or Tigris&Euphrates...

Fun game, and probably great with kids. Good games with grown-ups too. Most of the time you have no knowledge about the animal in question which leads to some fun speculations. Only tried the German version which made the game even harder. Would really like a Swedish edition for the kids.

Reminds me somewhat of Manimals but this is better imo.

Players play rounds where they have to "guess" certain aspects of an animal.  An animal is revealed, and players take turns placing a cube on either a location of the world map, or a weight, height or tail length scale.  When all have passed, the card is extracted from the slipcase, to reveal the correct answers, and points are paid out.  Points are paid for dead on, as well as for adjacent to correct answers - a brilliant idea.  Excellent game, wonderfully illustrated, and perfect for families.  Perfectly playable in the German edition, but an English edition would be wonderful, just to introduce this game to a wider audience (and we can get the 80 page animal fact book translated!).  Excellent trivia game, fun, educational and easy to teach.  Lets have an expansion (insects?).

Me aburrí bastante luego del tercer animal, sin lugar a dudas a mas gente mejora el juego, pero no deja de ser algo MUY básico para mi y lo peor es que los niños que podrian ser el publico objetivo del juego son incapaces de jugarlo competitivamente por no tener idea de pesos o medidas de animales, una lastima porque queria que me gustara.

The fun of animal trivia combined with brilliantly simple mechanics. The game design here is rock solid. It's strategic, educational, and most importantly fun. Even if you know very little or nothing about the animal in question you can still score points with smart play. At least you can minimize your losses and save your big moves for animals you're very confident about. Don't worry about replay ability. There are a ton of cards and they are double sided. You will probably get 20 to 30 games without repeating an animal. Even if you see a repeat and remember the answers then you learned something! It's a win win!

This game receives a happy welcome wherever I bring it. Animal trivia has a broad appeal when paired with bidding. I didn't expect that, but I'm glad of it!

In my sessions I've experienced musing, guesses, wild bids, hedging and hand measurements. The results will surprise you. Even if the animal's habitat is obvious, it's height or weight may surprise you!

There are more than enough cards to offer variety. Don't play too often and you should never be in danger of hitting a repeat card and recalling a stat or two. There are simply too many! Having an 'easy' and 'hard' animal on each card only improves that.

Fauna is a trivia game that actually deserves being called a game. Due to the adjacency rules you don't need perfect knowledge (although it certainly doesn't hurt), there is some punishment for too many blind guesses, and there is a host of animals included that you've probably never heard of. As far as trivia games go, it probably won't get much better than this.

As a gamer, I have problem with many trivia game, since they emphasis on pure knowledge. This is totally different from games like Trivial Pursuit since this you don’t have to know exactly where the animals live or how long or heavy they are, just have a conception about it. This game is really fun to play and you learn a lot about wildlife. I felt the game was a little short though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
I don't like knowledge type of game but this one is different.  You don't have to know the exact answer.  Instead, each player place cube on the map, on the weight or lenght track.  You score point if your cubes are on the exact space or 1 space away form the exact answer.
Each player place 1 cube at a time so if you have no idea where a particular animal lives or how tall it is, you can just put your cubes next to the other.
The scoring method gives everybody a chance to win the game.

Fauna is a trivia game but a very unusual one. Each turn, a card quizzes the group on a certain animal. Players take turn "answering" by placing tokens on certain spots of the map to show their habitat, on a weight track, and a height track. Players continue to guess as many answers as they desire, then the bottom of each card reveals the answers. What's interesting here is that the guessing is open, and players can guess based off of others guesses. This is a wonderful family game. Adults playing with children who are growing interested in exotic animals of the world is a perfect audience here. For a trivia game, the guess mechanic is my favorite. For scaling, it is okay at 2, and better at larger counts. Fauna is unique in the style of Freedman Friese. Will be excellent for some groups, but falls a bit flat as a 2 player couple. When children are in the picture, this will likely return to the collection.

Was very enjoyable.

Only one thing was making me think after our little Fauna session: We had a bunch of cards where the animals show up in 17+ areas (points you can earn in this game can be seen on the lower right corner of the game board) - that means, that placing your cubes in a correct area brings as many points as placing it into the neighbourhood of a correct placed cube on the size/weight bars.
And in that situations the game relieved often any tension.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a very cool idea for a game. Players will use their tokens to make estimates and educated guesses about various animals such as their height, weight, habitat, etc. It's a trivia game only in the sense that Wits & Wagers is a trivia game, and in fact Fauna's design likely owes a lot to it.

Players take turns placing one of their 6 tokens at various places on the world map or on the continuum of heights, weights, and tail lengths. Being exactly right is more points, being adjacent to correct is worth fewer. Any outside those ranges are lost to you, and returned at a rate of 1 per turn. It is advisable to use all 6 per turn to score as many points as possible, but the risk of losing so many pieces gives you a tough choice.

The components are functional. There are a LOT of different animal cards which should give this game good replayability. The card box nicely displays the name and picture of the animal for all players to see, while hiding the relevant info until the card is pulled out of the box.

This game is likely too difficult for children to play, even those who love animals, which is kind of a shame. The feel is so similar to Wits & Wagers that I probably won't purchase this, but I'd usually be willing to play. However, it really feels a lot like a party game to me, which means I'd probably rather play something different if given the choice.

This is a winning combination of trivia & game play. I really love that you do not need to actually know the animal (actually most of the time we don't since they are all in German) to make a good guess at stats other than regions it inhabits. I do hope someone does and English version at some point, but we have a lot of fun with it as it is.

An animal trivia game based on quantifiable facts about animals such as their weight and the length of their tails, and where they live. The map is a little funny in a German-centric kind of way (did you know Chicago is on the border of Canada and Mississippi?) but it's still a pretty neat little game.  The cubes are placed, almost worker-placement style, on your guesses, but getting close counts too, which means that you can base your guesses on what other people think as well.  The animals are cute, there's a nice catchup mechanism and the game is a good length, so it's more fun than I expected to have with a trivia game. The metric system increases the level of difficulty for American players.

Works well with women (and men, but especially women) who love animals and group guessing. Some play it almost as a cooperative game. It mixes a trivia game with a sort of worker placement mechanic, which makes it a great game for the whole family.

Nice game, very replayable.  Try to guess geographic locations, size & weight of very obscure animals.  You only get through 5 or 6 animals before the game ends, so replayability is very high.  Easy/hard settings.  Sometimes the name of the animal gives away locations (those cards should be removed).  This begs for an expansion.

Well, it tries to be a cute Wits & Wagers.  It doesn't really cut it for me however.  It's still a good game, but not great.

The whole cube purgatory seems like too much overheard for too little impact.  Too much of the game just depends on looking at the picture of the animal.  It's usually worth hitting the oceans for adjacency.

Still, there was a lot of promise.

I'm not a social gamer, and I don't enjoy 99% of party games because of it, but this is probably the best trivia game in existence since it mitigates the uncontested-skill(memorization of mostly useless facts) aspect of all the other standard trivia games.

Trivia game all about animals.  You're placing cubes corresponding to geographic locations, as well as certian ranges of weights, heights/lengths, and tail lengths (depending on the animal).  You don't really need to have knowledge about the specific animals, but a little geography knowledge and a little bit of common sense can go a long way toward helping you do well.  Also, to a certain extent, if you know someone else knows something you can place near their cubes and score some points.

Fauna takes my interest in animals and turns it into a really enjoyable game.  I'm not the greatest at knowing everything there is to know about animals, and if I didn't know that before, this game certainly makes me aware.  That being said, you never really feel as if you're just terrible and you usually feel like you're in it for the most part.  Even if you don't know a thing about the animal in question, you can usually follow your opponents and do well...or you all fail!  Lots of fun and really turns learning into a fun experience.

This game is a must as soon as an English edition comes out! :-)

(Wishlist: either English or French edition only)

English edition coming Q2 2011!
From Canadian publisher Foxmind, with the game on display at Nuremberg 2011 in February. 

Got and played.
Docked 1.0 points down to 6.8 from 7.8 for huge missed opportunity of not addressing exotic invasive issue, and including both introduced as well as native ranges without differentiating, as well as sloppy biological concept of distribution, and what seems to be some fact-checking errors.  They should have consulted with a biologist (preferably with biogeography training), which it seems they didn't.

In Fauna each round one more or less known animal is turned up and players have to make more or less well-founded guesses on its area or origin, its weight, size and tail length. Correct guesses or guesses adjacent to the right guess are awarded with points.
Knowledge helps but even without it Fauna can be played and is enjoyable. It shows that trivia games have come a long way since Trivial Pursuit. One of the best games in the genre.

Guess how big an animal is or where it lives, betting your cubes.

If you lost the bet, you lose the cube, if you got it right the cube remains for the next round. 
This can get problematic as a runaway leader gets more cubes (max 6) than the others (min 3).

Still, a very light and fast game so you can get another game going rapidly.
Excellent with children, and there's also a hard mode (exotic animals)

Fun party-trivia game. You get points not only for answering perfectly, but also for getting close enough. Answers are done through a public draft, so there's a nice guessing/bluffing mechanism too.

When playing with adults, it's much more fun if you play with the black cards (the unusual animals). It adds a bit of a push your luck, not to mention with adults it's more a party game than anything else. And let's be honest: trying to guess things about obscure marsupials can lead to funny banter and jokes. Meanwhile, correctly estimating the length of a deer isn't particularly fun.

RATING: 6.5
360 animals on big cards are waiting for the players of Fauna. Every round a single animal presents itself by name and picture. The 2-6 players try to guess the animal's weight, length, height, tail length and - most important - the areas in which the animal lives on the Earth. The early bird gets the worm: an area on the big map or a sector on the scales already occupied by a player token cannot be chosen a second time. When no player wants to set another token the round ends and the scoring is performed. Tokens on correct spaces get points for the corresponding player, also tokens in the direct neighborhood of correct spaces score points. Tokens not earning points are temporarily out of the game - so risk should be carefully considered. Next round - next animal - starting player changes. The first player who reaches a certain total score wins (normally after 8-12 animals).

I highly recommend this "party"/educational game.  Similar in some ways to Wits N Wagers but people are guessing animal habitats and measurements and instead of wagering points/chips per se, one actually wagers betting opportunity cubes.  Miss more than one answer and you start losing opportunities to guess answers and earn points on future animal cards.  Lots of replayability in this box as you barely use more than 6-15 cards in a game and the game comes with a double-sided deck of 100+ cards.  There is an easier side and a more difficult side to each card regarding more familiar animals and less so.

This game is a family weight "trivia" game about animals.  An animal is presented to players and you place bets on where in the world the animal is located.  Players also can make bets on it size and other attributes.  You get more points if you are exactly right and lose points the further off you are from the correct answer.  

Very kid friendly as there are easy and hard animals.  I likes the game a lot.  It is a party game feel to it rather than a true Euro feel.

RATING: 8.0001
This is the most fun I've ever had with a trivia game. There's a lot more to it than just making educated guesses. Since you score being adjacent to the correct answer you have to decide at times if you are going for the correct answer or put your bet cube in an area that has many adjacent areas hoping for a better chance to be correct. Since the questions are about animals, you can make some deductions about the size and location and you get points for being in a range not just for the exact answer. 

In a game like trivia pursuit you pretty much either know it or you don't and that's the extent of it. This game keeps you engaged even if you really don't have a clue due to the area placement and estimations.

Games about wildlife are hard to come by and well conceived ones are even harder... to come by.  This is a good one.  You don't need to be an expert either, though it helps.  MY only gripe is that there are no interesting facts about the animals beyond area of occurrence and physical dimensions.

It’s hard for a guessing game to win my heart, and you can’t blame Fauna for not trying. A nifty way of encouraging risk-taking while simultaneously punishing foolishness makes it a game instead of a mere quiz, and the wild and wooly world of animals supplies a seemingly endless source of showing you how little you know. Replayability should be high with a 300+ card stack of animals, and all in all, this is a perfect game to play with non-gamers while still enjoying yourself.

I'm surely not too bright - I don't know what did I expect from a trivia game about animals, when I'm not particularly interested in various facts about them. If there would be fun facts at least, it may work, but four fairly obvious/totally uninteresting parameters?! 

Stripped down to basics, its only merit is the bidding mechanism, but we have Wits & Wagers for that, why bother with this?

Terrific trivia game.  The system is very solid and keeps less knowledgable players engaged.  There's a slight similarity to Wits & Wagers in that you can use your opponent's knowledge to benefit.

This might not get as high a score if the topic wasn't near and dear to my heart.  Animal life was (and is) a favorite topic growing up, and this is a game I can actually get my father to play.  So it gets a very high rating indeed!

What is basically a trivia game in a single category, Friese manages to put a lot of "game" in the box by forcing players to guess multiple categories and prioritize them in the face of a one-player-per-guess restriction.

With the right crowd, this game is surprisingly fun.  I figured learning about animals would be educational but I wasn't expecting the game to entertain as much as it has.

Most of my games thus far have been with 6 players which seems like the optimum way to ensure lots of tension.  With that many players each placing 3-6 cubes, there will likely be only so much room for correct or adjacent to correct cube placements.  A lot of cubes will be sent to cube hibernation, which is always fun.

The real fun is when the first player confidently places a cube on one continent and the other players follow suit by placing cubes nearby.  Then when the answer turns out to be on the other side of the world, much lamenting ensues. Very fun.

I got this more or less by chance as I was supposed to pick up a party game for a night with some nongaming friends, and the FLGS could not find Wits and Wagers on the shelves, and Fauna was the only other game they had that I recalled that had got some decent reviews. But it was never on my to get list as I had found the outset to be very unattractive: I hate trivia games, I'm not a fan of zoology and the fact that it was a Friese game I found just about absurd. But as chance had it this was a very good party game - it's fun if played as a party game and it works well as a family game with kids as it's fun and educational. Don't know about replayability but it's not the kind of game I'm going to pull out for weekly game nights, but as a party game with nongamers and gamers mixed it works very well! Clever mechanism of cube placement, and scoring for almost right answers.

Ein überraschend schönes Wissensspiel. Hier kann man auch durch abschätzen und knapp-daneben-liegen noch Punkte erhalten, wodurch es mehr Freude macht, als strenge richtig-oder-falsch-Spiele.
Und weil man nacheinander in verschiedenen Kategorien wettet, ist es sowohl angenehm taktisch, wie auch gegenüber Halbwissen nachsichtig.

Der Bruder Terra ist ähnlich gut, thematisch aber breiter gefächert. Dadurch ist das Spiel zwar unvorhersehbarer, aber auch nicht so [i]schön[/i], wie sich für eine gute halbe Stunde nur mit Tieren zu beschäftigen.

RATING: 7
First impression (6 players): For a trivia game it is very good. There is penalty for being wrong but you can still just guess and get at least 3 guesses for the next round too. On the other hand clever playing enables you to score big when there is animal you know a lot about for sure.

I'm not too big fan of trivia games in general but this one is one of the better ones.

Could be a rock-solid knowledge and gambling game (very much in the Wits & Wagers mould) if it weren't for the fact that some cards - inevitably - are so much easier that others and therefore disproportionately benefit the start player for that given round. Likewise, others lead to a huge score off the map with precious little attention required elsewhere. Great for families and Christmas, though, with a canny tactical interplay which belies the cuddly theme.

Wonderful game! My wife and I really seem to enjoy games with a map of some kind. Coincidence or not this is another game we really enjoy. The game is very simple, you are shown an animal and you may guess it's weight, length, tail length or where it lives in the world. It is amazing to me how close you can get to accurately guessing some of these facts. But you don't have to, you can just be close to right and still get points. You can even guess more than once if you have enough player blocks. 

This game plays similar in style to Wits and Wagers, except there is no betting. If you think someone else is right with a guess you can try to bank points by winning a spot adjacent to their guess. This is a great educational game like the 10 Days series is...another words you learn without really trying. 

This game is sometimes very funny. My favorite thing is the length of the tail. Sometimes the picture shows maybe a tail...maybe not... Do you guess 0 inches or do you go with 1 to 3 inches? Also, the length of the animal. Some animals could be huge or very small...your just not sure...it's very funny seeing what everyone thinks.

A trivial pursuit game dedicated solely to what you know about animals, both common and obscure, taking turns securing (placing cubes on) a region where they live on the map, or placing cubes on the 3 provided segmented scales for how much they weigh, how long they are, and how long their tails are. Get most points for placing in the exact right spot, less points for placing on the spots next to the right spots, lose cubes for getting it completely wrong, get correct cubes (plus 1 lost cube) back for next round. Repeat. First to get enough points to pass the post wins. That's it. It can be kind of interesting to guess the obscure ones and learn the truth, but that gets old pretty fast, animal after animal, and there's no real replay value unless you're a big animal loving fan. Nothing but animal trivia. A pass.

One of those games in which whoever played it most wins. Also I found the gameplay to be tedious. I will join in a family game if asked, but wouldn't be the one to suggest it.
In other words, I'd only consider it fun if playing with the same people over and over again, or just for the sake of education. If you played this game a lot, invite someone who hasn't and trounce him, that's not fun for either side.

RATING: 8
Questionable game, since I hate all the estimating and guessing stuff. For example Wits and Wagers.
This game was a really pleasant surprise! 

The guessing has been done so that you don't have to know the exact number but rather the scale or even somewhat close to that scale and that's the best part in this game. It's actually fun to guess where those animals live and what their measures are.

One of the greatest surprises this year!

Update: Mmm, may have to knock the system down a notch, as obviously the more knowledgeable player(s) will score more, hence probably best with at least 3 to squeeze out that player occupying the good spots. But my main concern is that the loss of markers to as low as 3 may add to the rich gets richer concern. So maybe there is a handicap system possible.


Is this Mr Friese's take on worker placement? It has that lovely occupation tension if you're confident in knowing where an animal lives, it's weight, body or tail length and an opponent is hovering with placing their cube on your answer. Even if you don't know the answer it still has the emotional aspects of speculating and risk to score more, coupled with the tension of the reveal and scoring track. A very good educational game.

RATING: N/A
I know a lot of useless shit and I love that games exist for me to let that knowledge out. Fauna is better than your average "guess/state the right answer"-style game in that you are using cubes to claim areas on the map and on size tracks. You don't just gain points from guessing the correct answer (the vole lives in the Eastern US, the panda lives in China), but you gain points if you're [i]next[/i] to the correct answer as well. Which can create these great situations where you're the only person who thinks Animal X lives in Eastern Europe and so you load all your cubes around Eastern Europe to get all the adjacency points while everyone else focuses on South America and you shoot way ahead. Or you don't know the correct answer yourself...but something about the glint in Sean's eye makes you think he does, so you just follow his guesses. Hopefully you chose wisely. 

It's fun. Some trivia games suffer from not being appealing when/if a potential player thinks they're not as knowledgeable as other players. It's defeating before you even begin. But this one allows people who might not know trivia to at least gain points and move forward.

Played this twice:

* One round at a game convention in which the board was enlarged and hung up on a screen or easel. Pieces were affixed to the board with that blue putty you'd use to put posters up on walls. This experience soured me to the game. This format added way too much downtime to the game since each player had to walk up to the board and stick his or her piece onto it. Also, the ambiance of this convention was definitely not fun-conducive.

* A whole game at a friend's place. Much better experience. This is a game during which you simply relax and guess. Still, the scoring is way too overbearing for such a light game. Why couldn't the designer implement a quicker scoring system like Wits & Wagers. Also, guessing wrong is very punishing: you get less guesses in subsequent rounds. The only justification about this rule I could see is that it makes the games last shorter (less turns), but it's so un-Euro to punish mistakes like this, especially for a family trivia game!  

Anyway, I would love to pick up a copy of this once and English version comes out.

Il grande Friedemann Friese non si smentisce! Con la sua originalità riesce sempre a creare giochi bilanciati e soprattutto scorrevoli, in più ha il pregio di essere adatto alle famiglie. Considerato un Animal Trivia, occorre indovinare... sulla mappa del mondo dove vive, peso, altezza e in alcuni casi lunghezza della... coda!!! Si trascorrono partite veloci, divertenti e interattive. La rigiocabilità è garantita dal fatto che non si possono memorizzare tutte le caratteristiche degli animali: giocandoci non troppo spesso risulta ottimamente longevo. Ottimo Family-Game. Veloce, semplice da imparare, divertente ed istruttivo.

This is a great party type game if you like animals as my wife and I really do.  The game is very easy to learn and the animal information is fascinating and we think we already know a lot about all types on animals. What makes this game really great is that it's not just a trivia game.  There is a real strategy to placing your cubes and you can get some hints from those that might have a better idea about an animal so you can still salvage points even if you have no idea.  Additionally, there is a press you luck aspect as you really want to get all your cubes on the board to take up the "adjacent to the correct answer" spaces but you have to weigh that with losing your cubes if those cubes don't score at all.  Just a great light party type game that really suits my wife and I and can't wait to introduce it to gamers and non-games alike.

Innovative trivia game where players try to guess the living areas of certain animals on a map by placing a cube on it (reminds me a bit of Wits & Wagers). The animals can live in several areas. You get points for guessing right or from placing the cube on an adjacent area. Players also try to guess weight, height/lenght and/or tail length depending on the animal. The components are of very high quality and the game suits also for children. Everybody loves animals - right? Looking forward playing again.

RATING: 6
A well thought out family game that's one of the best in its class of animal characteristics guessing games. It's got some good competition too - Können Schweine fliegen? and Manimals are also good games in their own right.

We are guessing within a range for different characteristics of the animals. Location, weight, length and tail length (one to even it up for the kids). Placing one of their six cubes at a time the players reserve certain locations or estimates for themselves. There's points to be had for being adjacent to the correct location or range. If you're completely wrong you'll lose that cube for the next round - one cube being returned at the beginning of each round.

So, it all works and is fun to play with the family. Some animals I'd no idea where they resided in the world and I enjoyed the challenge of looking at the picture of the animal (sometimes the name gives it away - sometimes it can be a bit misleading), and try to work out where they resided based on characteristics. This keeps it entertaining for adults, as well as observing the decision making by the children.

One issue when children are joining you at the table here is that they have to have a basic concept of units of weights and measures. (My youngest is four years old.) How long is a metre and how heavy is a kilogram? We help them out by telling them the container of milk they pick up for breakfast is 2kg when full, and estimate for them the length of an animal they're showing the size of with their hands. It works, but it's a bit clunky and slows down the game a fair bit. This is fine when playing just with the family - it becomes a fun educational exercise - but because it slows down the game it means it's only really suitable to play within the family.

I love the Gulo Gulo.

I won this game at Spilletrille 2011. I think its a very interesting and different trivia game about animals. It has mechanics which attract gamers as well. 

The cards and board are beautiful and invites to play. Many cards and since we only use a few every game, replayability value is high. Can be played with 2-6 players. One time we played with 10 people, some playing in teams. So, can be played with any amount of players. 

You use your cubes to bet where the animal lives, how much it weighs, length, hight etc.

I heartly recommand this game for ANYONE!

Kedves kis családi. Állatok méreteire és lakhelyeire kell tippelni. Nagyon megengedő a játék, bár profi játékosok esetében lehet sokat számíthatnak a teljesen rossz tippért elvett kockák, de én nem éreztem lényeges nehezítésnek. A nagyon sok állatkártya ellenére úgy éreztem nem sok újrajátszás lehet a játékban, de tényleg körülbelül 6 kártya fogy el egy játék alatt összesen így hihetetlen mennyiségű parti van benne. Csak ajánlani tudom minden család számára.

Fauna takes the traditional educational game of learning rote trivia facts about animals and turns it on its head.  I think the big key here that makes the game far more interesting than flash-cards about animals is that players must work with a limited number of action points to make placements in the play areas that are themselves limited by the actions of other players.  Couple these dwindling resources with a siding point scale that gives greater rewards for accuracy while not completely shutting out nearby answers, and larger points for animals whose biomes cover smaller spaces, and this is an educational game that "works" for adults and children without bogging one down in thinking about "learning" and instead focuses on having fun and playing a game.

When I first read the rules for this I thought it would be so simplistic that it would be boring or repetitive. I have happily discovered this not to be to true. I've enjoyed this a lot so far. It is simple, but it tests your knowledge of geography and your ability to make educated guesses in a way that no other game I own does. And it does it in a fun way. I'm really impressed by this game.

Fun game! If we were likely to play this very often, I certainly wouldn't mind owning a copy. As long as you don't play with some kind of zoologist, this is a great little trivia game. Actually, even if you do have someone "overly" knowledgeable, it can still be a fun game: although you may not win, you can try to bet on their knowledge sort of like you can in Wits and Wagers.

Excellent game :) Good kind of a trivia game with a room for some some evaluation and imagination. It is funny, because even if you don't know you can always guess. It is engaging, because some players are suggesting you good answers or are so utterly wrong while you know that for sure! And it is teaching you something about the animals of our planet. Recommended.

L’avreste mai detto?
La giraffa può superare i cinque metri di altezza, e il caimano jacarè segna solo 60 chili sulla bilancia. Ma quanto è lunga la coda dell’orso polare? E dove vive esattamente la rana botton d’oro?
Queste e molte altre curiosità attendono i giocatori di Fauna.Ma siamo onesti: non si può mica sapere tutto, specialmente se stiamo parlando di 360 animali di terra, mare e cielo! Per questo si fanno punti anche quando si sbaglia, ma solo di poco. Attenzione però: se rischiate troppo nel piazzare i vostri segnalini, potete perderli anche molto in fretta!

RATING: 7
Trivia game where you make bids for regions / weight & height bands, with points for being in the right area and for being adjacent. Rewards intelligent guesswork.

Trying to interpret the German animal names actually adds a fun element to the game: does Alpen suggest Mountain or Alps? When some whale came up, we weren't sure of the scale, and we were very hesitant on guessing length or weight so we stuck to regions, figuring that since 14 would be right, what could go wrong? I managed to place 2 of my 3 bids in the only 2 regions this whale [i]doesn't[/i] get to.

Fun game. It's sort of a trivia game, but there are enough options that you can usually do pretty good by guessing and following the lead of the other players.

Update: Moving this from an 8 to a 9. Such a great game to play with non-gamers, and still a lot of fun for gamers. And the amount of variety is great: after 13 plays we still have plenty of unused animal cards.

Some nice ideas spruce up this trivia game (partial points for proximity, "logarithmic" scales for measurements), but in the end it remains a trivia game.  I'm hoping to have my students create some expansions that ratchet up the knowledge requirements beyond the 4th grade level.  It's not that it's easy to know all the answers by any means, it just seems that it would be nice to add some other numerical choices that would require greater knowledge of zoology.

A trivia game of sorts in the vein of Wits and Wagers where the answer may be too mundane or obscure for anyone to know. Problem is, unlike Wits and Wagers where probably 99% of the questions are so tough to figure out, the animal cards here are uneven. You can have the "American alligator" or "Indian crocodile" show up during your turn or something like "green turtle" or "lined gecko". Totally random and if you unlucky during your turn, the animal is too tough to guess, you will have no chance of scoring a chunk of points. The point scoring difference is also huge depending on the number of areas the animal resides. If played in a friendly and non-competitive manner, then this game is alright. But if playing with fellow gamers, then this game is just too unbalanced and non-interactive to be any fun. I am judging it as a gamer.

RATING: 7.5
Nice trivia game about animals. Clever mechanics, but I slightly am worried about the replayability - is the quizzing the same atributes over and over fun after many games? For me, it maybe feels a bit too same turn after turn. But anyway, the game has its place in my collection, I suppose.

This game is great as a break from the usual Eurogames, which have similar mechanics, and are long and very thought-intensive (although I do love Eurogames).

RATING: 9
Rated after 17 plays. Much better than an average trivia game, because the animals might be so exotic, that you can't know, you need to guess. So the game is kind of softer, more relaxed and funnier. Also you don't need to know exactly, it is enough that you are close. Or at least closer than others. A nice game for non-gamers, too. Counting the points seems to be a little bit complicated at times.

Updated after 34 plays, because you can follow others, it gives a nice option to gamers as well. Black side with exotic animals is really fun! And educative, if you can remember something from the correct answers. :)

35th play after a long pause, this time with green side. Still very good game.

36th was on the black side, good game.

I bought this one as an educational game for my kids as they don't really read or watch documentaries as I did as a kid. It was a successful experiment. The game is easy to get into, the cards have pictures of the animals and the kids learn some things about where animals live, how big they are etc. They also learn that there is a whole world outside that they didn't really look at so far.

I have done this several times before (buying educational games for the kids) but this one actually also is fun for adults that have even a passing interest about wild life. I don't have to play it "for them" - I can play it for my own enjoyment.

Surprisingly fun game. I am not an animal person and to tell the truth I was not expecting much from this game. Later I read/heard some reviews of this game praising it so I thought this might be a great family game that in the future I will be able to play with my kids. 

It turns out that is just as fun for me. Not a gamers game but still an excellent light/family game.

Update: The only problem I see is that it might get old quite fast. We shall see I am not at this point yet. 

Update: It seem that people do not request it despite liking it on their first try.

Wonderful trivia and betting game suitable for many different groups of players from family to hardened gamers. There's a nice, almost collaborative element to the betting placements in that even when you might not know the answers for sure, you can usually make an approximation based on everyone else's ideas. Even so, knowledge and skill definitely give an advantage.

Maori is a variation of Carcassonne. You lay tiles to form landscape which is scored at the end of the game. The game also has similarities with Vikings because everyone has their own board and you pay to pick tiles from a common offering. 

When it comes to strategy I think the only real decision is whether to rush the game by taking a tile every single turn or to play it slow. Other than that, the game is mostly tactical. You can push your luck with an attempt to build big islands. However, there is very little you can do about tiles that are available. You just have to live with what is given.

The game is ok and I could play on casual occasions. The game is less competitive compared to Carcassonne and requires less careful play compared to Vikings (which is a game that can screw you completely if you do not pay attention to all details). On the other hand these softer qualities also takes something out from the character of Maori and it is easy to forget that you even played it the day before.

RATING: 6.5
Those who think Maori is like Carcassonne and/or Entdecker haven't played enough games. About the only think Maori has in common with those two games is it has a tile-laying mechanic.

It does, however, seem to be a cross between Vikings and Gunter Burkhardt's Darjeeling, although not anywhere near as good as either of those titles. 

A rather dry game with a pasted-on theme. Not bad...just not great.

RATING: 5
Think Carcassonne with its multiple ways of scoring, but with individual player boards to place your tiles on.  Think Carcassonne with a choice of face-up tiles to draw from and ways of extending that choice.  Player interaction there is, but it is limited to taking a tile ahead of your opponent or leaving them unable to take the tile they need.  I found Maori a derivative, though inoffensive time passer.

Tile placement to maximise scores, nicely done. A great filler: plays in half an hour but has lots of interest and I think would be worth returning to-- not least because of the variants included that seem like they'd increase the strategic interest.

Very well made set. As for the game, it seems a little dry and very easy for the grid from which you pick your tiles to become filled with tiles that don't particularly aid the score. This leads to all players cycling the tiles just to refresh the board which feels boring and unneccessary.

Would play as a filler, but nothing special.

RATING: 6
If this game is approached as more than a filler, you will be disappointed.  It is a light game that sometimes tries to rise to higher aspirations.  That usually shows in the tile selection mechanism - which is the mechanic that really permits the players to directly influence each other (but only to a very limited bit).  Much of the results will play out based on players creatively and perhaps luckily placing the island pieces onto the player boards best.  If kept light and played with pace in mind, I think it can work.  If too much time is invested, the game will sink.

Light, but still with interesting decisions. It boils down to: how much am I will to pay for the tile I most want knowing that it might not be available on my next turn, and if it is it could be cheaper or more expensive depending on where I can position my boat. Nothing wrong with that, and the scoring at the end of the game is simple.

RATING: 7
Such a delightfully simple tile-laying game.  The game could devolve into multi-player solitaire because each player is trying to build up their own little board.  What saves this game from that feeling is the interaction provided by the players taking tiles from the same pool.  Often players will take a tile that isn't as advantageous to themselves simply to block an opponent.

The rules are very straightforward, but there is a depth in the decision-making process.  I love how the game challenges you because you want to have everything (canoes, huts, shells, etc.) but you have to figure out which will benefit you the most.  It's those kind of tough decisions mixed with the beautiful art and the simple rules that I really look for in games.  This game also has that added benefit where players can look at their board at the end of the game and see what they've accomplished.  This often takes the sting out of losing, because the player can see all the good things they managed to do.

Rating after 1 play of the basic version. Id like to try the advanced versions of the game. Decent Carc-esque tile laying, using Cornett's "travel around the edge of the grid" mechanic to choose your tiles.

Edit: Bumped up 1 point. The correct rules (tiles can be placed illegally), and Variant 1 (place tile next to ship, move ship to any tile after turn) makes for an interesting game. The storage spaces come into play, etc. Variant 2 looks a bit hard, but Ill give it a try. Haven't tried the atoll board, but it looks like a good addition as well. A keeper.

One of the great 2010 discoverings. Give Maori a try!

This is not another Carcassonne clon. This game is original and really good. OK, is not a gamer's meaty game but a great family oriented game. Really enjoyable. I'm liking it more and more each time I play it, as good as others more famous (and better ranked) family games. 

Delicious as a 2 player game because is more controllable. Don't play it with more than 3 players, you can get a wrong and false impression because this can be extremely chaotic.

After you learn to play the basic game, try all the variants... you'll never get boring because there are many ways to play Maori.

Nice enough tile laying game that screams HiG.

Burkhardt borrows the "move a marker around a central display of tiles and choose from the row and column you reach" from his previous game "Herr der Ziegen".

The tile laying itself reminds me of a mixture between Carcassonne and Wikinger. End game scoring has several different elements, but they are nicely laid out on the players' game boards, so not too much to remember.

In my opinion it should definitely be played in the advanced or pro version. Basic rules are dull (but might be appropriate if you play with children on the lower end of the suggested age scale).

Quick, light game that I find pretty fun. There are mildly interesting choices to make, from how to spend your shells, how may extra boats/shells to take, and whether you want to risk it all on a lei, not knowing if you'll be able to complete it. 

On the other hand, there is so much luck involved that there is very little room for improvement. Decisions are a little obvious, and sometimes there is nothing on the board that anyone wants, which can be kind of a drag. But as a very basic family or gateway game, I like it well enough to want to keep. My husband disagrees.

Maori is a cute little game that reminds me of some kind of cross between Vikings and Take It Easy.  Players move a common boat around a group of tiles, hoping to be able to pick up tiles that will score them points on their individual player boards.  What you're able to get often depends on where the player before you left the boat at the end of their turn.  Nothing too special, but not bad either.

I have only played this a couple times online and thought it to be a good light game. I feel A lot of moves are scripted and there is a good amount of luck with the tile draws, but I still thought it to be a good game to play with family or as a light game with gamers. The theme is friendly and since the game is light it offers a good light strategic experience of scoring the most points.

I like Maori, but there seems to be something a little off about this game. I can't put my finger on it, but the mechanisms are a little clunky. I actually think it might be fun just to play with straight Carcassonne rules. We only played with two players so I also suspect that more players would fix the awkward play issues. It is a very pretty game and overall a nice addition to any collection.

I see this as a kinder, gentler version of Vikings.  Select tiles to add to your tableau, but thoughtful placement is key.  Manage your resources carefully and leverage your movement options.  I think this is definitely a good game, but it's too similar to Vikings to add to my collection.

One real concern is the randomness of the tile draws - they can definitely make or break a player, which could frustrate someone that wants to see a long-term strategy pay off.

The other concern is that players must be extremely cautious not to use all their shells - once you're out, it can be hard (or nearly impossible) to get them back.  That effectively paralyzes a player a takes him/her out of the game.  At least in Vikings you have the option to trade off victory points for money.

Production: Wonderful, simple tiles. The huts, trees, and canoes help make the board feel inhabited (I don't want to build this archipelago unless someone's going to appreciate it).

Play: A few bits of Kupferkessel Co. and Take It Easy mixed together with Oceania. Several different interesting scoring possibilities. So far I dislike the variant using the boat, whereby one is limited to the adjacent squares for placing a piece. Between canoes and spending sea shells, my opponent has enough flexibility that I find it quite difficult to anticipate possible moves. (3+2+3) (1 play)

RATING: 6.5
[2010-08-14 Rating: n.a. -> 6.5]

Rating is based solely on my plays (2 player) of the game on www.yucata.de.

In Maori, players try to build a valuable island world on their own player board. The tiles needed to create this island world are collected from a 4x4-grid. To get a tile from it, you need to move a ship meeple and claim an "adjacent" tile. The movement of the ship is the only interaction that is in the game. Once one player fills his player board, the game ends (every other player gets one more turn) and the scoring happens.
Points are awarded for the palms, shells, boats and "flowers" that you placed on your board.

Comments:
-----------
* Maori is a nice little game with quite a bit of luck. It's fun to watch your islands evolve and to decide which scoring route to take.

* Although the interaction is limited to the movement of the ship, the game can be played rather cutthroat. Example: Watch your fellow players board and take a tile they desperately need.

* It's a nice filler, but I don't think I need to own it right now.

A mildly interesting game which adds a few new mechanics to a Carcassonnesque base, though without capturing my imagination in the same way.  Two player game plays somewhat strategically, but chaos increases with the number of players.  Game play generates few interesting decisions. In all, fell a bit flat for me, especially as a four player game, where victory seemed determined by random factors. Rating of 6 is a composite of my rating (5) and my wife's rating (7).

Picked this up at a Half Price Books on a whim and turned out to really like it.  While the game is basic in design, there is definitely some deeper strategy in using your shell currency to move that ship just out of the line for your opponent or forcing them to have to make some quick decisions.  Would definitely like to play this with more players though.

Wondered if we should ditch the blank water tiles in a 2 player -- since we were left with 16 tiles where few were of interest.  
In some games, like Fjords, there don't seem to be enough tiles, but here almost the opposite was true.  It would take spending more time looking at the tile distribution and the respective probabilities, but it seems like there's an opportunity to affect the balance with less players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Beautifully produced tile-laying game with some strategy required in collecting the tiles.

I prefer the basic version - the restrictions on tile placement using the coloured boats made for more analysis-paralysis (though I liked that it led to more use of the storage facility), and the need to build high scoring islands with the atoll side of the board meant a lot of turns when no-one picked up.  Both slowed down the game, which for me outweighed the interest added by the additional rules.

If you're a meat-loving gamer that thinks that Carcassonne is merely milk suitable for gamer babies, then look elsewhere. But for the rest of us, Maori might just be the Mario Kart we're looking for in a board game, as a quick and speedy arcade like board game experience. If you want a Carcassonne fix on speed, without feeling that you're just getting Carcassonne Express, then this is probably the right game for you! A pleasant-looking, quick-playing, light-middleweight game that is ideal for families, children, and non-gamers - and has the potential to satisfy gamers looking for a quick two-player session with their significant other.  Can be described as Carcassonne meets Vikings (with the addition of an Entdecker theme, and in a shorter and quicker form), but adds a form of resource currency for special actions.  Has quite a bit of luck, but the quick game time plus tactical use of ships and shells to help overcome the luck of the draw and maximize your options for tile drawing is a simple but sophisticated mechanic, and makes the game for me. Two player game is best (only 15-20 minutes!), and allows for many tactical plays.  Played 15 times in 3 days already!  Now starting to try the more advanced variants for an added challenge.

Played two games with Charles (grey beard) and Brian (new guy) and still like it.  Played two more games and definitely not as much fun with 2 players.

Szigetépítős tile placement játék, ami miatt nagyon érdekelt. Pár online játék után, azonban úgy érzemm hogy nem egy túl jól sikerült darab. Három nehézségi szinten lehet játszani, de végig elég nagy szerepe van a szerencsének. A nehezítés a szinteknél nekem erőletettnek tűnik. Mindenki a saját világát építi, így annyi az interakció a játékosok között, hogy esetleg el tudod happolni a másik elől a neki nagyon kellő lapkát. Emiatt ugrásszerűen megnő a szerencsefaktor mondjuk a carcassonne-hoz képest. Ráadásul a játéktér is elég kicsi, ami miatt gyakran egy-egy laptípusra kell várni, ugyanis forgatni itt nem lehet.
Ha tile placement, akkor már inkább carcassonne, basilica, vikings. (6)
----------------
Még játszottam egy párat vele, és kicsit jobban megkedveltem. No azért nem ér a fent említett játékok nyomába, de el lehet ezzel is szüttyögni annak, aki szereti a tile placementet. Kettőnél többen játszani szerintem nem sok értelme van. (6 -> 6.5)

Ez a játék ment eddig át a legnagyobb fejlődésen pontszámok tekintetében nálam. Két játékossal nagyon élvezetes, taktikus játék, ami gyorsan lemegy, és pont annyi agyalás van benne, ami még szórakoztató, és nem fárasztó. ->8

Leülepedve, több játékot megismerve ez csak 7-et ér összességében. Két játékossal meglehet a 8.

After one play - 7. Let's see how it develops...

EDIT: Definitely an 8. Comparable to Carcassonne but with more tactics and thinking a few steps ahead. The "advanced" version seems a bit better balanced (in terms of scoring) but I still do not know, what the purpose of these little ships is. They just seem useless and obsolete.

Anyway - fun, short and pleasant entertainment.

EDIT: Now I know how to make use of these little ships. They make the game deeper and more tactical. Nice idea.

Carcassone meets Entdecker meets...  But in fact it works well, and using the advanced variant with the boat restricting placement gives it a more gamerly feel, though still fairly light.  Nice pieces.  Main quibble is with the name - "Polynesia" yes, any Pacific Island name, "Hawaiiki" would have been clever, but there are no coconut palms and thatched fale in NZ where Maori are based.

It might as well be an abstract, but then there would be no lushly-colored island tiles, chubby white wooden conch shells or boat moving around a rondel. With its 3-page rule book, you can learn it in minutes and it plays quickly. I wonder if there's enough depth to warrant much replay. However, the game comes with several variants. Put on some Martin Denny while playing and you'll be too relaxed to worry about that.

Wishlist(5) - Don't buy this

Tiles collected from 4x4 pool, but player makes his island group on his own 4x5 board. So this isn't a "true" 4x4 game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A pleasant, little, lite game. Every turn a player moves the ship token (up to two spaces) around a 4x4 matrix of tiles representing land masses, shells, ships, islands, huts, and leis. A tile adjacent to the ship token can then be taken after movement. As tiles are taken, they must be arranged on a player's mat that has very limited spaces. Ships give more movement of the ship token for the player, while shells allow both extra movement and "buying" of tiles in the interior of the 4x4 matrix. VPs are scored for the number of palm trees that are on completed islands (i.e. there are  end pieces and middle pieces, some with more palm trees than others), with huts doubling the score of that island. Completed lei islands score 10 pts, which is huge given they only take up two spaces, while the other islands may score 6-9 pts, taking 3-4 spaces! The most shells and most ships give points as well.

This feels a little like Entedecker, although the island exploration mechanism is more abstract, as players are "constructing" islands, rather than circumnavigating them. Still, it is a intriguing mechanism, and the advanced rules make it even more so challenging. I'd play this again, as it makes for a reasonable filler, but wouldn't go out of my way to buy it for myself.

Update (01/20/12): Initial rating was a '7'. After over a year, I don't miss it, nor do I care to play it again. It's a cute little game, but... it's a '5'.

A short tile-selection-and-laying game.  It has several elements that will interest people who like laying tiles--the placement is limited in an interesting way and there's an element of prediction in the placement.  It's not really my kind of game, though, and I probably won't play it again. (1 play)

Some neat mechanics here.  Probably best described as taking the island building mechanics from Vikings and adapting it to a two-dimensional board (i.e., building horizontal and vertical islands) . . . and without Viking meeples.

That being said . . . I liked Vikings quite a bit more.  I was happy to see this offered at www.yucata.de though.

Basic game is good (and recommended for learning the game).  The advanced and pro version of the rules ratchet up the difficulty enough to add to the thinking each turn.

Aug09: This one landed "slightly above average" for me. Really, it played smooth and fast. The only annoyance was I didn't think each game would really evolve that different. Maybe I'm just being damn picky these days.

The rules were clean and so was the play. The decisions were somewhat interesting, but not much. You did have to care about sitting up the next player and keeping your islands clean.

The variants could add a bit more forward planning. I didn't try it with the player boats.

If it's cheap enough and Steve keeps talking it up, it might get ordered soon.

Everyone says the variants make it better.  I don't know if I'll shell the cash to see if that's true.

This game is a lot of fun in a small package. The game plays very quickly, and in spite of what appears to be limited strategy in a two-player game, there is still enough to keep both players on their toes. The added advantage is that the designer included several variants built into the game itself, so without downloading, printing off, or making fake pieces to work with, there is a ton of replayability right in the box!

This game scales very well in terms of complexity/difficulty depending on which boards and rules options you use.  Played a game with a woman and her three children (5-11), using the basic rules and they could all keep up and enjoyed the game.

Maori is a pretty neat take on tile placement games.  I love having that boat moving around, allowing players to be limited to what they have access to at any given time.  I think that the volcanoes which may show up add a pretty neat element, blocking the ability to obtain tiles located behind it.  It's also just a lot of fun to build islands and move that silly boat around.  The variants also add just enough to not overly change the game.  Good stuff.

Generic eurogame fare but better than I expected from the lukewarm reception it got everywhere. Can be played as an alternative to Zooloretto, Thurn & Taxis or Carcassonne.  Easy to get into and after one play you'll have recognized what tiles are best. Gameplay itself is mostly tactical with the necessity to plan one to two turns in advance. It's best with two or maximum three players. With more it's only opportunistic with no chance for advance planning.
There's a good online implementation at yucata.de.

I can definitely visualize Mr. Burkhardt after a session of Carcassonne. He lost the game. And he blamed his loss for the lack of choices and decided to reinvent the Carcassonnian tile lottery. He also put the players into building something of their own in the vein of PoF and Alhambra. Maori is a nice adaptation of tile laying games in which decisions get harder and options worse as the play goes on. The game is surprisingly prone to analysis paralysis. Not finding the right tile in the endgame also hurts a bit more in this one than in Carcassonne or Alhambra.

Granted, I didn't play this in the best player count, but this is a fairly dry tile placement game, that has stiff competition with Carcassonne. I do like how you get tiles more than Carcassonne though despite the much less clever scoring mechanisms. It reminded me also kind of like Glen More with the Euro-ey cube pushing/engine building feel that makes Glen More good: there's a track to get tiles with you being punished for moving further, there's tile placement, and there's pieces you have to move around on your tiles to make legal placements for your new tiles, and the lack of variability in the tiles you use (yes this game has a variable initial setup but the individual tiles don't feel different, just different ways to score) probably hurts replayability.

I was really surprised by this one.  Very little buzz, but we've really enjoyed it with multiple groups.  Build some islands, score some points -- fairly simple to explain and get going with new players.  The moving boat mechanism for tile selection works well and adds some good strategy elements.  There's obviously some randomness in the tile draws, but there seem to be enough options to allow you to always accomplish something useful each turn.  Fun theme, and enjoyable strategy in a small package.

Tiles are placed in a grid and players sail a boat around the outside of the grid to draft tiles which are then placed onto their player board to form islands.  There are a number of ways to score and increase sailing capacity (for more choice, etc.).  Also, one can pay to sail further or purchase tiles within the grid (orthogonal to where your boat stops).  

I think many will be frustrated by this as there's a lot of planning which can be hampered by what the player(s) before you do and the tile draw.  You need to try to mitigate damages (you don't score for incomplete islands and you lose points for empty water spaces).  I enjoy it but it's nothing to write home about.

The Advanced variant where you need to also move a boat on your player board after each turn (which determines where you can place new tiles) is a much more interesting option requiring further planning.

UPDATE: Moved rating down 1/2 point.  There's not a ton going on here.  Also, confirmed that playing without the advanced rules is boring.

OK light tile placement game. I like the tile selection mechanic very much but. I think it suffers from not bewing able to tell who's winning at a glance so you're not sure if you need to block them from a tile or if you should push to end the game. I think this one is probably best at 2p because of that.

You move a boat around a grid of tiles and choose island pieces based on where the boat lands. Each player has their own board and you are trying to score the most points by collecting palm trees. Huts double point value, shells give you currency to take tiles on the inside of the grid.

Overall, sounds like I'd enjoy this one.

In Polynesia, players move their boat around a grid of tiles, land their boat then collect a tile to put on their player board. Tiles collected have huts, palm trees, ships or shells. You score points for islands with huts and trees, having the majority in ships and shells. 

I've only place once so far, and it plays fairly quickly and cleanly. I'm not sure if there is any strategy yet, but I need to get a few more plays under my belt. It does offer many options and the tile you want may get snapped up or denied by your opponents.

Too light for my tastes, especially with so many other tile-laying games available. My one play had many rules errors due to no English translation being available at the 2009 Gathering but I got the gist of it, and some of the right rules would have probably made things worse!

Take your kayak and travel around the tile grid.  You can spend money to move an extra space, or pick up a tile further away from where you landed.  Once you choose a tile you place it in your play area trying to connect your different islands in a way to score you big points at game end.  Be careful, once you place a tile it is stuck there for the rest of the game.

I found the scoring on the islands to be simple and very intuitive.  Good, quick, tile laying game.  I have only played with two on yucata.de so far.

Quick and clever puzzle where you try to maximize your score balancing several variables (palm trees, shells, huts, ...). There is as well a dose of push-your-luck element. I like the fact that the game lets you choose amongst different levels of difficulty.

Building up on Günter Burkhardt's previous success Kupferkessel & Co., Maori is based on the same mechanic of a piece circling around a grid of tiles and enabling some tiles in the grid to be taken. With these tiles the players must "build their own ocean", trying to fill it with boats and islands that will bring different bonuses (according to the amount of palms, huts, petunias or shells they show). Obviously there is some skill involved in filling up the board, especially using the variant where a "master boat" moves around the empty board leaving tiles on its wake. 

It's quite a feature that the same mechanic can lead to two rather different games, but at the same time this makes it impossible to avoid comparisons. Maori might give players more room to move than Kupferkessel, but the decisions are ultimately less agonizing and the task of building a pattern on the board has been used much more often than collecting sets with a peculiar scoring method and a bit of memory. Thus, Maori plays well but doesn't strike as Kupferkessel & Co. does.

Very light, quick game in the flavor of Carcassonne with 2 the best number. Not a bad game, not broken in any way,but not much strategy to it.  Provides an alternate board on the back of the player mats and adds some variants which give the game a small bump in complexity and keeps things fresh.  The Mrs likes it so it'll stay in the collecton.

Cross Kupferkessel Co. with Vikings, two of my favourites, and you have a neat and enjoyable 30 minute affair that I was always going to like. Like Vikings, you're gathering tiles and forming islands with them on your personal board, but the scoring is woven onto the tiles themselves, collecting palm trees, huts, leis, shells or ship symbols. To get tiles, rather than a cost-wheel, tiles are layed in a 4x4 grid, and you move the boat around the outside Kupferkessel style to a row/column that you want to pick a tile from. The first tile in the row is free, but each tile further away costs more hard-to-come-by shells. You can also move to a further row/column by paying out more shells if it's worth it and you can afford it. So, interesting choices to make each turn on whether to take freebies or pay for more. One of the features / issues with the game is that all the good tiles go quickly, leaving mainly dross for the latter half of the game. Don't set your board up waiting for a miracle completion tile, as everyone will pounce on any half-decent tile from mid-game on, meaning luck increases. But I've nonetheless found it engaging and well suited to the 30 min jaunt niche and I'm sure we'll get a lot of play out of it.

Maori is about what you'd expect for a tile-laying filler. The tile-drafting system was interesting, particularly the bit about spending shells to get "deeper" tiles. However, it also led to some left-right binding issues, as you had to make sure that you weren't setting up the next player to get the perfect tile for his board. The all-or-nothing scoring for shells and ships at the end was a little too swingy; I wish more than one person could score for these.

A very good short-to-play light-weight euro game.  Makes a good filler at the end of an evening.

There is a total of 6 variations on how to play the game.  Suitable both as a family game and a gamers game.

[We have also used a house rule that all tiles had to be orientated the correct way (not just the tiles with palms) to make the game a little bit more challenging.]

A charming filler that has a few interesting quirks. I like traveling around tile display with the boat and paying shells to broaden my selections.

I love how simple, and yet, how thinky it is. The movement/purchase/scoring mechanisms are very smart for such a little game. This is a special game for us.

Bad. Draft tiles from a 4x4 matrix and place them on your board. But while other puzzle games like Factory Fun, Ubongo, Thurn and Taxis, Galaxy Trucker etc provide interesting considerations for you to place your tiles (and even rotate them), Maori's tile-laying is uninspired: simply complete islands, leis and collect shells/boats.

I also do not like it when the official rules do not suggest a solid way to play the game, and instead have a bunch of mix-and-match variants. "Oh look, you can play it this way! And that way! Combine! Different methods for different tastes!" Pick a way, and stick to it.

Vikings (Wikinger) hasonmásnak gondoltam a játékot a lapkák alapján, aztán utánaolvasva rájöttem csak a szigetépítés hasonló, de semmi köze a két játéknak egymáshoz. Ez egy könnyed, nagyon egyszerű szabályú, akár családdal öten is játszható társas. Gyors, pörgős mégis némi gondolkodást igénylő könnyed kikapcsolást igérő igazi családi társasjáték. Nagyon jól működik mind két, mind öt személlyel is egy nagyon jól kitalált lapkaszerző mechanizmussal.
A játékosok szigeteket építenek a saját táblájukon. A cél minél nagyobb, értékesebb szigetek építése, illetve sok hajó elérése. Egyedül az lehet a kérdés, hogy nem egyértelmű-e a nyerő stratégia, azaz minél nagyobb szigetek sok pálmafával.

An interesting little tile placement game. Doesn't feel nearly as cutthroat as Carcassonne since everyone is playing on their own board. Of course, there is still some interaction since you're all taking tiles from a common pool. And there are many tactical decisions to make -- how far to move the boat, when to spend your shells, which sets to try to build towards, etc. 

Pretty fun filler-type of light game.

--- Rules Summary ---
16 tiles showing islands, peninsulas, or isthmuses are placed in a 4x4 grid. The rest are face down nearby. There's a Hansa-like boat placed on one edge next to one of the tiles. Players start with 5 mussel tokens.

On your turn you must move the boat clockwise up to x spaces (x = # of boat icons on your player board -- start with 2). May spend mussels for extra movement. Then either:
- pass
- take a tile from the row/column where the boat ended movement. Pay 0-3 mussels according to distance from boat.
... place drawn tile on empty space on your board or in reserve (max 1 tile in reserve)
... draw random tile to replace drawn tile
- remove tile on your board from game 
- move tile from reserve to your board

Game ends when board full -- all other players get one last turn. 

Remove all incomplete island tiles. Then score according to icons on tiles:
- palm trees worth 1 each, or 2 if there's at least one hut on the island
- complete leis worth 10 each
- player(s) with most mussels and boats score as many VP. 
- lose 1VP per empty space on your board
Most VP wins.

I need to play this one a few more times. Tile selection is the key to the game. Maximizing your choices is what you should be aiming for. I enjoy the game, but find it a bit too light given the rules complexity. It also has a very strong left/right binding issue. A weaker player will almost always help the player to his left. That said, the game is popular with my wife and many of our friends. I certainly enjoy the theme. For lighter fair, it's not bad at all.

I've heard a lot of comparisons with Carcassonne ... other than the fact that Maori uses tiles, I'm not sure the comparisons are apt. The mechanics here actually remind me much more of Kupferkessel Co., in that players are moving around the packed tile area trying to pick up desired tiles within range and movement limitations. Maori isn't as elegant as Kupferkessel, though. Still, this one is quick and harmless. Players of equal still level are probably necessary, as not setting up the next player to get an easy, high-value tile is a big part of the game.

Tile-laying games do not generally please me, but Maori strikes a unique chord that I enjoy.  It manages to be  easy to learn, have depth in gameplay, and yet not be Carcasonne.

The first of a handful of terrible games that I tried for the first time in October all thanks to my new game group in DC since I recently moved from NYC. I have a penchant for tile-laying games. I often enjoy the sense of accomplishment as you build something out of nothing by slowly laying tiles to construct a world from scratch. In Maori, you get to lay tiles onto your board to form islands worth a varying number of points. It sounds like something I'd like, but it's not. Not at all. The way in which you acquire tiles seems clever in theory, but is actually random and frustrating in practice. Then once you've gotten your tile, there's very little flexibility or actual choice in deciding where and how to place it. Essentially it's a boring experience that adds little new to the genre, and what it does add is not a welcome addition.

I desperately wanted to enjoy this game. A light weight HiG game along the lines Carcassonne, I thought it could be another Samurai or Through the Desert. However, the amount of luck in tile selection is terrible and for some reason, feels worse than Carcassonne. I felt frustrated playing the game and felt frustrated for other players as they struggle with lousy tile selection. Having extra boats on your board makes it easier for you to go around the board picking better tiles, but even with that advantage, there is no guarantee that good tiles are available for pick up. At some point in the game, most of the tiles were all single tiles or empty ocean tiles and no one wanted to pick up anything. Any long term strategy is moot since the tiles you covet may not be available or you may not have enough movement points to get to the tile in later rounds. I am not sure the variants really help improve the game since they just make tile placement even more restrictive. 

Overall, this game is more of a disappointment than I had hoped. Coming from a well-established designer, I was pining for a hit, but instead, I will likely cast this game into the trading pile.

Fun little game.  It is deeper than it looks at first glance.

Very simple, but surprisingly enjoyable quick after-dinner game. A favourite. Play the variants

Maori isn't a bad game, there just isn't enough there.  There are lots of tile games to choose from - Alhambra for one - that are of similar weight and are just more interesting to play

The most important thing a player needs to watch is the movement of the ship around the tiles one picks up.  This mechanic just feels uninteresting to me.  Whereas in Alhambra there's a lot more concern about denying your opponent a piece or in creating a garden or extending your wall line.

Purchased during "The Works £7.99 Frenzy of '11". Have only played the simple rules so far, seemed a little light so looking forward to trying the extended game.

fun in short spurts;  like Carcassonne mixed with a changing grid pattern that you have to choose tiles from;  plays quicker than Carcassonne;  good filler rather than main course I would say

Have played with 2 or 3 and also played with full 5, all without feeling crowded.  That's nice.

Basic mechanism and suitable duration allow easy entry for non-gamers yet shells and  canoes provide pleasant strategy choices for others with higher skills. 


++++

Draw a tile on your turn, place it on your playing board to assemble island formations that will be scored. Some tiles must have a specific orientation, horizontal or vertical.  Tile drawn is determined by a marker that moves around the perimeter of a 4x4 visible grid.

Having separate player boards doe not simply mean  this is solitaire.  You are engaged in watching new tiles drawn and calculating whether a particular one will be obtainable on your turn.

Added opportunities for strategy come from managing your inventory of Shells and Canoes - which are spent to give added flexibility to obtaining desireable tiles.

Pretty similar to Carcassonne and a better alternative. Might play it again.

A rules-interaction game. The strategy is wafer-thin: Pick the best tile you can afford, don't run out of seashells if you can help it. Upgrade your boat.

I generally liked the game, but it seemed to overstay its welcome somewhat.  In particular, the end of the game dragged a bit.  People ran out of money and couldn't progress, or it made more sense to do nothing than to finish building out the islands.

fast nice simple easy, a bit wicked, the way i like games.
Maybe not too replayable but maybe variants can help.
there's some planning, maybe not too many strategies to victory

Tile laying fun. Move around the outside of a set of tiles. Pick the tiles by where you end up. Some you have to pay for. Build you own board from the tiles taken. Fun game.

Some similarities to Carcassonne, with the way you lay tiles to form landscape features, but also very different in feel. Each player has their own board to build on, and selects tiles from a common display, moving a boat and paying shells (the game's currency) to try and get the tile they want.

It's very fun, light, quick and easy to learn. A great way to build up to, or wind down from, a heavier game. It gets bonus points for having several variants which feel quite different and help keep it fresh.

After 1 Play: My only play was the simple game w/o player boats, which people say is a pale imitation of the advanced game, but I still enjoyed it. I'm a sucker for a good tile laying game.

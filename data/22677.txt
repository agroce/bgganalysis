Sistema en solitario para cartas mio.
CDG diferente que reúne hexágonos y cartas.
Tiene una mecánica novedosa de pausas operacionales.
El movimiento (salvo para salir de ZOC) no necesita de puntos de OPs, lo que hace el juego más movido que un CDG normal.
Es más divertido en los primeros turnos, ya que cuando finaliza la iniciativa de la ofensiva del Eje se ralentiza mucho y se convierte en una guerra de desgaste con avance lento del soviético.
Tiene peor crítica en la BGG que la que merece en mi opinión.

This game provided me with a new perspective of the Russian Front.

The use of strategy cards and a CRT-like chart does provide an interesting game play with forethought of what you can try to acheive. (like the good old 3-1 odds that will surely inflict 1 point of damage).

The limitations on the cards as well as the card play itself per round weaves the story behind what is a hugh battle into a game that is both managable and easy to play.

The extreme difference in play for both sides, provides the taste that is so 'Eastern Front'. Reminds me of the good old days of AH, where strategic games could be discussed and played to a 'perfection plan' for both sides.

Currently, no entire East Front game in print has brought such wide flavor to a wargamers' table. (no roll 6s to hit here)

This is not a Russian Front Story remake, that tells of how the back-and-forth battle that happened. This is a story that gave the background and let you make the decision of where to head for.

A unique Russian Front game that is worth the collection and continual play to perfection.

RATING: 6
combines BtB mechanics derived from Ted Raicer's (superior) Paths of Glory design and then marries it with fiddly, puzzly, low counter density hex and counter gameplay.

Its an awkward combination that could have worked but falls short. The game suffers from the same card/deck problems of BtB, here its perhaps even worse: an unlucky seeding of the deck can deprive you of some critical card and torpedo your game.

I am also not a fan of fiddly, puzzly hex and counter style gameplay, particularly when married with some of the strange rules in this game. Defense is difficult (exploitation and ZOC rules etc. give huge advantages to the attacker) and playing the Soviets in the early game is very difficult. Of course once the Soviets get their big armoured formations in, lookout because they're going to steamroll the Germans like its 1941. The gameplay just feels weird.

RATING: 7.3
Quite good and balanced, tense. Excellent feel of the campaign, relatively easy. Supply rules are brutal, beware. Not sure that the game can really go beyond Summer '43, either side will have won by then I think. Quite enjoyable, the mounted map (reoriented, larger hexes) is a must.

RATING: 1


I clearly love OstFront games, and I continue to play Raicer's games because enough of them are worth playing. This one is a lemon, made more sour by the high quality components.  There is nothing wrong with getting away--finally!--from the point-to-point map and returning our hexes to us.  But this game works neither as a game nor as a simulation.  I guess Raicer has enough sells under his belt that he is allowed to pretty much do anything he wants, but this game leaves one wanting.

This Map is really ugly.

And why do they print the Tables on the map? There are Player Aids also. Waste of room, better used by a beautiful and large-hexed map.

RATING: 8.5
The Russian Front of WWII is one of my favorite periods.  This is a very good edition to the corpus of games covering that conflict.  

The card play makes for an interesting and re-playable game.  Well suited for solo play despite the cards.  Like the mix of large counters (Soviet fronts, Axis armies) and small counters (Soviet armies, Axis corps).

As others have mentioned, the rule book could use a bit more work to clear up confusion due to some omissions and rules that should be cross-referenced in multiple locations.  For example, there isn't any one place where one can find a clear, crisp summary of when the Consecutive Ops count is reset to zero that incorporates the "usual" rules plus all of the exceptions to those rules.

Great components.

Meh,

the game has huge potential and I am sure that this will work out in the end, but for now, the class of 2010 is in need of a logistical break.  Played it once face to face and once solo.  It just didn't work.  The play was helter skelter as it should, but I was hoping for so much more with regards to the interaction of cards and hexes (EOTS bias really showing here).  Anyway - not something I'll pick up until the kindling relights on its own.  I really B2B and was hoping this would remove some of the constructs that forced you to play outside of the Soviet Union.  Alas - it did not - you end up really hoping to get the right card sequence or else its a restack...

The Polish gaming contingent has devoured this game and basically proved that it is unbalanced.  A lot of people are trying to claim otherwise, but I would easily say that this needs to be put back on the gurney and reassessed from the beginning.  I think that if they do that they will end up with a real winner and I'll happily change my rating to 9+ and play it lots!  For now - this is on life support.

RATING: 6
And, down the rating goes. Stalin's War is too persnickety, with too many little fiddly tactics you have to master, and too unstable - '41 is so swingy between luck and the Soviets getting completely pulverized for minor mistakes that an interesting game is pretty unlikely to develop into '42 unless both players are quite skilled. No '42 or '43 scenarios are provided, to the game's detriment. And, in the Ted Raicer tradition, the campaign game would just take too long to play, assuming it were allowed to develop. Numerous production errors and usability problems make learning the game too hard. As with many Raicer games, a near miss, but definitely a miss.
---
I'm tentatively raising my rating as I think once a few basic tactics are mastered, the Soviet Union is defensible. Yes, the Blitz markers are insanely powerful, but for the Soviets that just means learning to avoid situations where you can get blitzed like the plague. Proverbial plague, even.

I think probably a more touchy issue is swingy luck. If the Soviets don't get a 4 or in their initial deal, or if the Germans get a bad hand on turn 2 (one 3, and no 4s, say), it's a huge deal. If the German's timing is bad on Hitler Takes Command, or if the Soviets can't play Industrial Evac for the event because its the only good op they get on a critical turn. As much as they may want to cycle cards, the Germans need to think carefully before discarding on turn 1.

Other things to remember are that once the early German AV is denied, the Soviets can give up a *lot* of territory and still be in. The game is all about force ratios, not space. You don't want to lose Moscow simply because it's highly defensive and the terrain further east isn't, but you can retreat southeast to the Volga if you have to. Trade space for time only somewhat grudgingly, preserve your army's strength, avoid blitzes (to the point of preferring to suicide units that can't get out of the open if needed), and hang in there until you can play reinforcement card 6. At that point, you can start thinking about hitting those German units that have been harassing you to this point.

Anyway, I think Stalin's War has potential, the reports of early German dominance notwithstanding.

What is probably the game's most serious flaw is that scenarios starting in '42 and '43 were not provided. '41 is always a problem, with the potential for lucky rolls and draws, or mistakes in play, being hugely magnified. Workable mid- and late-war scenarios would have improved the playability of Stalin's War tremendously.
---
Not quite sure what to make of the noise over the possibly broken early game, with reports of the Germans simply going all-ops and rolling over the Soviets. I haven't had that exact experience, although my experience with the game leaves me thinking it might well be true. Of course, B2B had similar issues and I didn't really run into them myself, as folks I play with are not really the sort who would gun for an auto-victory in '41. But the fact that the developer felt it was necessary to release a variant is, honestly, a blow to confidence. SW is an in intriguing game in many ways. If it turns out to suffer from exactly the same problem as B2B had ...
---
One play of the Tournament Game, rating is highly provisional as I'm intrigued to play it again, but it's a hard game to get a read on. As usual, the GMT production is crap - cross-references are wrong, turn track notations are confusing and misleading, crucial special cases (specifically the Rasputitsa in Spring and Fall and the penalty for not playing Hitler Takes Command) are not notated and so appallingly easy to forget and miss, and the "continuous ops" queue layout is an example of how to make a simple concept hard to play. The huge mapboard which includes tons of wasted space: large charts that are better served by player aid cards, and huge swathes of terrain that will never see play in a reasonable game. At the same time, it omits areas that saw small but not insignificant action historically that could have been interesting areas for what-if options. All in all, while the production lacks the typos, incomprehensible rulebooks, or major errors that we get too frequently from GMT, it still shows a somewhat worrisome lack of attention to basic detail. There really is no excuse for not having a rasputisa reminder on the turn record track, especially since Barbarossa to Berlin had a clear reminder of the Spring Thaw, which is exactly the same mechanism!

Other than that, it's a tough game to get a read on. Like its cousins Paths of Glory and WWII: Barbarossa to Berlin, it's very euro-ey in that many underlying systems are quite abstract. The convention of ops works sometimes, but small attacks (corps cleaning up reduced units in pockets) cost the same as massive onslaughts of armies backed by multiple panzer corps, and so there is a somewhat difficult to grok efficiency game you have to play. The continuous ops modifiers seems like a rather coercive and inelegant way to make players to play events and take breaks from time to time, when an organic solution would have been better.

I think it's got potential. But the initial impression was somewhat mixed, thus the rating. There is stuff here that is undeniably clever - the 1-ops cost for disengaging being a key idea that makes things  really interesting. But I don't know if the whole thing is there.

I've played a couple times.  I really enjoy most CDGs and have played B2B and PoG (Raicer's others). I had high hopes for Stalin's War, but I have some concerns.

Despite the penalty for playing successive OPS cards, I think its still not a sufficient disincentive for the Axis player to just play an almost all-OPS game. The 2nd decks don't come into play and most of the interesting political card events never occur. 

At the time I write this, there are some evolving rules modifications coming from the design/development team to try and mitigate this issue (and a perceived imbalance in favor of an aggressive Axis player). 

I don't actually mind the Axis favoritism. But I want gears in the game that give you an interesting tension between playing events and playing for OPS.  That's one of the fundamental features of a good CDG....and I feel its missing here. 

Other than that, I really like the hex map. Studying the terrain and having a wide open palette of choices for how to construct an advance/defense is more satisfying than the point-to-point map of B2B. I think the scaling is about right. I just think that the design was underbaked. Its possible with some rules tweaks it will salvage the game, but the early suggestions I've seen do nothing to create more dilemma for the Axis on how to play his cards, so I'm not terribly optimistic.

Tentative rating after one play. A CDG meets a hex and counter game that works nicely! It does not feel as scripted as WW2: Barbarossa to Berlin and is also more fun to play. I look forward to trying it again soon.

I am not impressed with that map at all. Map needs to be chopped off around Kirov and the hexes really could have been larger considering how big the map really is. Just condense the charts and free up some real estate and the map could have been really nice. My back was killing me after 6 hours of leaning across terrain THAT WILL NEVER GET USED! If the Germans are poking around back there then it is time to call it a day. The Russians are probably toast. I am tempted to fold the bloody map, so the useless portion is not in the way.

I really liked this one, this is a Card Driven game that has actual hex movement and not point to point like most of them.  Historical flavor, I found it to be evenly matched but there is a big community knock against this as being lopsided.  I found it to play smooth and was fun.  The new revision only allows GE ops to reset after playing a non reinf event that might address the imbalance.

I was very excited to get this game, given the the amount of how much I enjoy Mr. Racier's other designs, such as PoG or BtB. I mean, CDG and hex-based counter-pushing combined, what is not there to like?

Well, after two games that only went until turn 4, I am a left a little bit disappointed. Here are some of my thoughts:

As other commenters have mentioned before me, the map includes areas far east of Moscow that I cannot see playing any significant role in this game. Basically, this part of the map can be folded away. Of course, alternatively the map could have been rotated and the hex size increased, which is another grief I have with the game. The hexes are very small, and when combined with 4 unit stacking and large and small counters, it can become somewhat fiddly.

I agree 100% with Chris Farell's post about the messed up rules and turn track notations. My initial reaction of seeing exceptional rules and 1 turn only special cases noted under the turn track was very positive. I tend to have a hard time remembering special cases and rules exceptions. But of course, this concept only works if the reminder under the turn track is complete. As Chris pointed out, several very important special cases are omitted (e.g. mud turns, reminder of German winter penalty), which makes the initial concept of a turn track reminder less useful because incomplete.

There are a lot of special rules and exceptions that apply to only several turns in this game. There are a lot of things to remember (special cases, fiddly rules) that make the overall design less elegant when compared to BtB or even PoG. Yes, in my opinion even PoG, which certainly is full of special cases and exemptions!

RATING: 6
GMT Games.  Neat game design for the East Front.  The game gives players the feel of the Blitzkrieg in the feel of a hex based war game while adding the flavor of a card driven game. Players must make decisions on how best to use their cards - so decisions have to be made on both sides each turn.  This game is very different from other current GMT card driven offerings.  All in all, Stalin's War is a reasonably good, fun 1:1 war game.

Simple rules, but a steep learning curve to this game. Defensive placement is critical for the Soviets early, but the Germans must learn the same lessons when the tide turns. Very different feel from Barbarossa to Berlin (of course) and a very clever adaptation of the CDG system to land-based hexes (Empire of the Sun was the first to use hexes, but it was largely naval).

Un juego muy criticado por dos motivos principalmente, porque está descompensado (bastante más fácil jugar con el eje), y porque deja una sensación "ajedrecística" que pa'qué. Ninguno de los dos motivos me molesta en exceso, siendo ambas críticas ciertas.

Jugar con el ruso es un reto realmente interesante, pero sólo si lo juegas con un rival con la misma experiencia que tú o con menos experiencia, porque un alemán con más experiencia ganará la partida casi sin despeinarse apenas unos minutos después de desplegar el juego.

En cuanto a la sensación "ajedrecística", se debe principalmente a la combinación de varios detalles del sistema de juego: el funcionamiento de las ZOC, las reglas de suministro, la fase de desgaste y, sobre todo las reglas de movimiento relacionadas con las brechas que se consiguen con los ataques con blindados. El ruso se pasa los primeros turnos de la partida buscando lugares donde colocarse de forma que no le puedan hacer brecha, y desde los que pueda retirarse hasta una segunda línea donde el alemán tampoco pueda aprovechar la fase de explotación de las brechas. Se trata de crear una "maraña" de ZOCs que consiga ralentizar el avance alemán y a la vez asegure combates de desgaste, evitando los movimientos que consiguen los blindados al atacar en terreno "limpio". A mí en concreto me gusta el reto, y de hecho creo que me va a gustar más jugar con el ruso que con el "rodillo" nazi, al menos los primeros turnos, porque es un verdadero reto conseguir frenarlo hasta que llegue el momento de tomar la iniciativa, son al menos 6 u 8 turnos de espera, después la partida tomará un cariz diferente durante otro tanto de turnos donde ambos bandos pueden hacer pupita y al final será el alemán el que se vea obligado a ir cediendo terreno de forma ordenada como lo hizo el ruso al principio.

Me gusta, quiero jugarlo más !!

Nice take on hex-and-counter CDG's.  

Germans must move as fast as they bloody can before the tide turns or they're toast!  Some nice options for objectives for them--go for Moscow or head south to the oil fields.  Pick one and go all out.

Once the Russians put a stop to their advance, it's all about lasting until the end of the game, which I was not able to do.

For the record, I did not find fault with the rules.  They seemed perfectly clear to me.

Yeah, I got this in the spring of 2012, in search of the Holy Grail that is a great Eastern Front game.

Well, played it through a few times both solo and with two of us, and, yes, tense and entertaining. I still have to learn some of the subtleties of the game. I tend to play the Soviets as a gamer more geared towards the defensive kind of strategy, and I must admit, I find it hard to stop the juggernaut against an experienced gamer. But then again, that's part of the fun. I struggle a bit with the supply rules, to be honest.

Stalin's War is a solid interpretation of the Eastern Front of World War II. Although it can feel restrictive, the game encourages historically reasonable strategies and is an evolving challenge for both players. However, Stalin's War cannot be seen as a classic Raicer design. The map is bad, the rules can be confusing, super stacks are encouraged, and perhaps most of all it is missing a certain kind of fun factor that I felt when playing Paths of Glory, Clash of Giants II, and even The First World War. Stalin's War avoids the gamey features of World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin, but it never quite rises to the greatness it seemed destined to enjoy. This is a shame since this game, long delayed, was so highly anticipated.

Preliminary rating after my first game.

There are some nice new ideas in this one, but the smaller number of action rounds seems to make the options more limited than in other CDGs.

It also seems that luck in the card draws can have a significant impact given the smaller hand size and the fact that the decks cycle more slowly.

--------------------------------------------------------

UPDATE: After six games, SW is rapidly turning into one of the biggest disappointments in a long time and that's why I've lowered my initial rating of 7 down to 4.

I don't remember playing an Eastern Front strategic wargame in which one of the sides has so many features working in their favor as the Germans have in SW during the first few turns: Combat strength, movement rates, unit density, poor defensive terrain everywhere (IMHO, cities and towns defensive advantages are way too low), locking ZOCs, and supply and exploitation rules make OKH's life way too easy. 

I know that some of those features (not all of them though) are common to many other Eastern Front games. But I've played quite a few times TRC, RF, EF2 or B2B in the past and I never felt as overwhelmed by the Germans as I've found myself in this game. The mobility and strength of German units in the early game seems truly excessive. Thus, most games seem doomed to finish with a German victory between turns 2 and 6. 

Besides, I'm also starting to wonder about the historical plausibility of the German initial advance. Was it historically possible for the Whermatch to reach the outskirts of Rostov, Voronezh, Tula and Kalinin by the end of September 41 (end of turn 2)? Could have they kept on advancing steadily all through the Fall and threat Gorki, Saratov and Stalingrad before Winter 42 (end of turn 3)? Because I've seen all the above happening in almost every single game that I've played. 

In any case, I would really like to be proved completely wrong and rest assured that suboptimal Soviet strategy is the only reason for the lack of balance in the early turns as I do think there's the potential for a good and balanced game here. But if that's not the case, the design team might need to face a thorough revision of some key rules.
--------------------------------------------------------

UPDATE 2: Raising my rating from 4 to 6.

Thanks to the developer of the game, Paul Marjoram (awesome dedication on his side!) I'm starting to understand how Soviet defensive strategy works and I'm starting to feel reasonably confident about the balance of the game.

However, I'm not specially keen on how the maneuvering of units work in practice. More specifically, panzer mobility seems rather gamey and unrealistic.

So, I'm not so much worried now about design soundness as I am about the simulational aspects of the game fitting my personal taste.

-------------------------------------------------------

UPDATE 3: Back to 4 after three more games.

Still worried about game balance. But even more worried about the historicity of the whole thing and the gamey actions the system imposes on both sides (especially the Soviets). I'm starting to think the designer chose the wrong title for this game as it seems to be more Hitler's Wet Dreams than Stalin's War. :D

The more I play, the easier it is for the Germans to encircle and attrit the Soviets on a regular basis while suffering zero casualties. Besides, the Soviets cannot even attempt to interfere with the German advance west of Smolensk, Kiev and Dnepropetrovsk given the unbelievable mobility and exploitation bonuses of the panzer units. 

As a result, the Germans suffer almost no attrition at all during the first 3-4 turns while advancing much faster than they historically did and suffering no logistical penalties of any kind. In fact, the panzers will usually be at Gorki, Saratov and Stalingrad by the end of turn 4 (winter '42). Completely unrealistic in all accounts.

I still think there are some really nice design ideas here. But the sum of all parts turns out to be a historical fantasy and a pretty dreadful gaming experience when playing with the Soviets.

Although I'm not a fan of Ted Raicer's other games and dislike the OPS/Events dichotomy of CDGs generally, Stalin's War has such a wide-scope and grand strategic focus that I'm intrigued and willing to give it a go.

Later: Concerns about play balance (i.e., Axis AV being too easy) and all the errata (incl. cards!!!) will keep me from punching out the counters. I'll trade SW for something else and maybe pick up the 2nd or 3rd edition after the game has been properly developed, edited, and proofread. I do not enjoy paying good money for the "privilege" of being a playtester.

I would rate this game a "1" as it clearly seems broken from the various threads here I've read. However, rating a game I've never played seems bogus to me, so I'll just leave this little diatribe for others to find (maybe).

I don't know it looks great but just doesn't taste right.  Something isn't quite right here.  And just what is the other side of the Urals doing on this map, when the Finnish front was removed/deleted from the map?  Yes, I know the designer wanted to show just how much of Russia the Germans wanted to capture; yes, yes, very nice.  Now where is the Finnish front?I think that would have been been a better choice.  Does any one else feel cramped in the Start Line to Moscow area?

Some gamers think Ted Raicer's CDG's are scripted. I think he's just trying to keep the game relatively accurate chronologically. This is WWII: Barbarosa to Berlin with a hex map instead of point to point and a bit more streamlined as far as the rules go.

We played 2 games assessing whether the Germans can achieve a quick victory and in both cases; it did not happen albeit it was very close.  In both games, the German player was just using the cards for OPs; blitzing their way to Moscow.  Despite the rapid German advance, in both games, the Germans were "exhausted" by the end of 1941.  Good and tense game.  We were playing with the original rules with errata and yes, the rulebook could have been better written.

At about 38 games in, half as German and half as Russian.

Poor rulebook, we had to read threads on consim & geek to get it right.

Marvelous game, though. Keeping the Germans at bay in the first half requires guile, keeping the Russians at bay in the second half requires stamina. After 300 plays of Barbarossa to Berlin, my Sunday antagonist and I look forward to wearing this baby out. 

Note to Russians: You are not getting an early auto victory, Joe, plan for the long haul. Get to Total War ASAP.
 
Note to Germans: You are not getting those oil fields, Adolf, focus on Moscow.

"It took Napoleon's army 83 days to enter Moscow, on 14 September 1812.  By contrast, Hitler's Field Marshal Fedor von Bock's motorzied and armoured divisions needed 167 days to arrive at the approaches to Moscow, but they never entered the capital." p. 13 Stalin's War by Albert Axell.

You can't resist this. The physical components are the best in GMT's recent years. Charles Kibler's map is a breakthrough from the tiring GMT's normal map presentation. It is much more colorful and realistic, less abstract and bland. The choice of non-blitzable hex by the Soviets is very important in the game and hence it is crucial that the map is a pleasure to read by both sides. Some people complained the CRTs on the map are too large and the area east of Moscow is not used and thus they are wasteful. While I agree that the hexes can be enlarged for easier play while the sizes of the CRTs can be reduced, I can assure you the area east of Moscow is "intended" to be included because, well, the Germans can really push that war when it comes to a lousy Stalin player like me. 

After 2 plays as the Soviets, I side with the common consensus that the game is heavily favoring the Germans with the Operations and Blitz combat system, at least in 1941. I am not sure if the balance issue can be fixed and even if it can, it might be a different game from the original design. As of now, it doesn't make use of the cards as such as the German can simply win by keep playing the cards as operation points and there is no point to play the event... as you don't need the key cities like Moscow, Stalingrad or Leningrad to win in a mini-tournament scenario. The cities are for you to go after automatic victory. If not, taking sufficient number of victory points in the cities can bring Germany to the victory as well. By the end of turn 4, the Romanian unit captured Stalingrad and some German panzers moved behind Moscow and deep into the rear area of USSR. I think the Soviets only have a slim chance to win the game or have to play the game so perfectly that no single mistake, even a slight one, to be made. 

The balance issue aside, I was really wanting to love the game. This desire led me to believe that the game has something to offer after some more plays. If there is something hidden behind, it is surely hidden deep. Perhaps the designer wants you to explore things more deeply before you can master a seemingly uncomplicated game on the eastern front, or perhaps he is deliberately letting the Germans having the upper hand before winter 1941, the German cards are all intended for OPS play instead of playing out the events before that time. They are, perhaps, meant to be played after reshuffling when the card deck runs out of cards. The problem is that we cannot guess the intention of the designer and everything is only a guess at hindsight. A "What-if" type of question to the designer's intention. 

In fact, I quite like the "blitzkrieg" system - one that hinging on the concept of moving further after winning battles over the vast steppes of Russia. A winning German panzer (or Soviet Guard tank) units can go further for a distance halving of the units' movement rating, ignoring the enemy Zone of Control. This is a revolutionary idea that shakes the classic Avalon Hill's Russian Campaign - where there would be an automatic second mechanized movement impulse for the Germans, limited by the advance into enemy ZOC.  In Stalin's War, the Soviets can learn the tactics and play it on their turn with their Guards Tank.  In my opinion, Ted's "blitzkrieg" is the most powerful combat concept and game mechanic that turly reflect the nature of the blitzkrieg tactic in the games I have seen so far. 

The game surely has the scale right for a strategic level wargame on the Russian Campaign. Finland was left out in the game appropriately as there was little action at the game's overall scale. You don't need to roll for weather and the winter effect is largely hard-wired to the turn. All these streamline the game cleverly without a trace and enhance playability. But the play balance issue really begs to ask whether the game has gone through a rigorous playtesting process as it claims to have the playtest credits in the rulebook. The designer already proposed some fixes, which might imply an admittance to the play balance issue that was supposed to have been fixed by the playtesting cycle. 

The game has its many merits and a competent, experienced or perfect Soviet player could have put the game right into a proper Sovietcentric view of the campaign, as its title suggests. But I am afraid the average Soviets could never hold that long enough to see the view. As of now, it is a game of very Germancentric view of the war, just so as it was told by the many early German literary work on the campaign. 

The designer Ted Raicer goes for the conventional notion that it was not the superhuman Germans that made it but the supply problem caused to the Soviets that the German's spearheaded Panzers could have made it. The German does have a slight tactical advantage in terms of checking supply in their own last round, instead of the usual end turn supply check where the Soviets might have cut the supply line again as they closed the gap in their own round before the end of turn. If you are tough enough as the Soviets going through the less-than-capable German assaults through 43', you would be likely to see how professional the Soviet Shock Troops are (each is 5-2 Combat-Movement rating). They pounded through towns after towns, cities after cities.

Having said that, I am still looking to play the German side next time in a face-to-face game and to play the Soviet side again in a VASSAL game when more time can be allowed to see if the Soviets can really come back into the game, i.e. whether later Soviet reinforcements can really push back the Germans in terms of both quantities and quality of their troops, as long as the German still haven't initiated Taifun ("Operation Typhoon" against Moscow and captured it. I am never tired of the campaign and this game still has the potential to become on of my favourite.

I recently had the 3rd play of the game as the Soviet (I was not convinced that the Soviets were doomed in this game and very much like to see Soviet or Allied victory over the Nazi) using the new rules.  Namely, the Germans no longer reset their Operation Points on the track with the play of cards as replacement.   

Before the new rule, the Germans were too powerful to stop and if the German player had the right operations card (Taifun, Blau), it was likely that the Germans could accomplish the victory conditions by playing cards for Ops continuously and reset Ops by replacement.

Under the new rule, the Germans are slowed a bit while they do not reset Ops to 0 with replacement. It means the number of cards to reset the Ops track is getting smaller. It is less likely now to me that they can win the game by going after 20 VPs without playing the events to reset the Ops track. I have been enjoying a game with Ken using the new rules. The Germans were stalled in front of Moscow and I have managed to perform some limited Soviet counterattacks. The sense of imminent dangers to the Soviet Union still lingers in my every moment with the game as the Comrade Stalin did.  Excellent game longevity.  Bravo a great game is born, albeit only after such an important change to the rule.  

If the Soviets can go that far, the '44 Summer Offensive can be done.  It is tempting for the German still going forward into the frontline, dropping more and more troops into a "bulging front", like Hitler was after being frustrated with the repeated defeats.  It is dangerous to do so indeed.  The supply and sticky EZOC rules in this game surely would seal off the fate of any cut-off armies.  Battle lines must be straightened up and reserves should better be made available for linking up the supply line backward to the supply sources.  Otherwise, pockets would be formed and armies vanished quickly.      

In No Retreat, it was the vast defenseless USSR territory that made the Soviets impossible to draw a line to defend unless right before Moscow where forest hexes around were protective to the infantry. In Stalin's War, it was the German superb offensive and excellent operational flexibilities and doctrines that won them at the initial stage of the war.

I would describe this as an average game with some great moments as well as some mediocre ones.  The game seemed to progress in a very predictable way which I suppose is inevitable given the subjct matter.  I found some of the card mechanics a little "ho hum", especially the soviet "filler" cards which have no function except to enable the play of a another card later in the game.  I'm certainly willing to give it more of a chance and it wasn't unenjoyable, it just wasn't memorable.

First impressions after a few turns are that this is an interesting twist on the CDG formula. However, the rulebook is not the best, and there should have been a summary sheet for the exceptions / special rules. Hopefully someone will produce one of these. Also surprised at the map design, no Finland and vast swathes of Russia that will generally go untouched. Regardless, I did enjoy playing so far and I really like the way OPS are used in this design.

After buying the game and able to look at all components the map looks even more ridiculous as there are 5/8 counters in the game and it seems from AARs that building stacks is a common strategy. Less area covered and bigger hexes would have been nice.
To punch or not to punch (and sell), that is the question.
**********
Downgraded to -Thinking about it-.
Playtest map looks curious, at least 25% of space reserved for German antiguerilla operations in the Urals.
Is this a Hex game or a Point-to-Point game shrink for whatever reasons into Hexes?
Don't understand the reasoning to use Hexes if such less Hexes are needed for the relevant parts of Russia.

RATING: 5
I find it quite difficult to score Stalin's War as I have some quite mixed thoughts on the game, but the score of 5 relates to whether or not I can see it going on my table again.

For - I like the graphics, the colours of the map remind me of a more youthful time when enjoying AH Russian Front, counters are functional and the Play Book is nicely done out. The play aid cards are well done and there is an overall urge to push this game to the top of the play list - initial reading of the rules encourages this mostly.

Against - I agree with several posters that the map should not have extended so far beyond Moscow and that charts should have been dropped on the map in favour of re-orientating the map and stretching it to give bigger hexes. It would look better and would cope with the inevitable stacking better. 

on Face value, the rules seem straight forward, but once you start to factor in the rule exceptions in general and the differing rules for large and small counters and understanding the interplay of cards as to how the playing of one card can effect the playing of another, played or yet to be played, then the effect means that there is a steep learning curve to playing the game well and it does not suit the kind of player (me) that plays a game once or twice and then moves on to something else to return in maybe 6 - 12 months time - but it would be better suited to people who like the game so much that they play it regularly, especially against others that play regularly.

So my dilema is that I think that though this has a well thought out system, with good history, the game for me is not particularly accessable to my gaming style and tastes - I do of course recognise that others will see good value and playability in this game ...... so please judge my scoring in that light. (I should add that I am not a great fan of card driven games ((but I love the east front as a subject)), so again judge my comments in that light)

Like Barbarossa to Berlin, but just the Eastern Frojnt and with hexes instead of spaces, many of the units are cards are the same. The game is rather pro-German and Moscow is in the centre of the small map as the Panzers are expected to reach the Urals! In my experiance the Germans win three games for each Soviet win, but if they can survive the initial onslaughts in 41-42 it can get a bit grim for Hitler.

Depending on if you know about previous Ted Raicer´s designs or not, your perception about "Stalin´s War" will be completely different. As a "Path of Glory" and "Barbarrossa to Berlin" veteran, "Stalin´s War" appears as an adaptation upon the previous titles. There are two main difference, one is the hex metaphore used for movement instead the traditional point to point system. The second one is the blitz option for mechanized units, allowing them to exploit holes produced during combat. This is a key issue for the German player and, in my opinion, it gives a critical advantage to them. In fact GMT released a new rules version to minimize this unbalance situation. This game will amaze you if it is your first experience with a Ted Raicer game. For all other just another notch on your gun

An OK WWII eastern front CDG. There are a few quirks with the supply system that really can punish you but I think that is more of a learning curve issue than a real problem. 

Updated my rating after a few more plays. It is terribly boring to play the Soviet Union. The harsh supply rules combined with your low OPS-count in your deck makes it impossible to do anything but withdraw, play a mandatory event and play replacements.

RATING: 6
Thought it would turn out to be a very good game. 
However, the map layout is awful - huge hexes in a tiny map and loads of on-map charts that we have never looked at, preferring the Player Aids instead.
Important rules like the mud, etc are lost in the rules and too often forgotten.
Game play gets odder and odder - why can only one LCU attack, for instance, or have I read that wrong? The Blitzing rules, which are a great idea, never quite seem to work - again, it might be me.
I have played rather a lot of BtB and I'm not finding that SW comes across as a new game; as others have said, the cards seem frequently to be identical, and the change from area movement to huge hex movement is less than exciting. The movement allowances in a game with season-long turns seem odd - a mechanised unit could in reality (assuming no enemy action) easily drive from Berlin to Moscow many times over, rather than watching them crawl along if not wasting OPs on SR.
Finally, one automatic victory condition, whereby the Germans must pass a line by Turn 4 or lose, rather sums up the game - and, I suppose, the actual conflict. In my limited playing experience the outcome is pretty much decided by the end of Turn 4 and I find that things go downhill from there.
On reflection, I'm disappointed.

Very early going with this, and despite my negatives there are things to like (e.g., the irreplaceable German 5-3s), but...wow, a lot of things feel off: too much scripting, huge exploitation movement, blitz/terrain/stacking implications, disjointed rules, and the usual CDG oddities.

The scripting and the wacky exploitation movement are my biggest issues. Cards should involve choices. Soviet reinforcements may as well not have Ops or RP info. Weird and clunky to "draw" them in a fixed order. Better to just have a fixed reinforcement schedule (for both sides) and put genuine dilemmas on cards. What few dilemmas there are come from odd rules kludges, such as the (new) rules about only event plays resetting Ops for the Germans in turns 1-4.

Exploitation movement is loony. If Guderian is in hand, you can reach Smolensk on your first card! Even at 3 hexes, though, the results are overdramatic. But 2 hexes feels too small....

The two CRTs are odd, too, given their symmetry. Why bother? Why not just give the LCUs another combat point or two and use one chart? Extra rules cruft for no good reason. Or (more to my way of thinking) a missed opportunity for some interesting asymmetry.

And the map, wow. I can see Archangel to Astrakhan, maybe even a hex or two more. But Chelyabinsk? Chekhov's gun applies.

Still, not giving up on it. I think it's 1941 that is the culprit, as is often the case in EF games.

RATING: 7.4
Similar in mechanics to Empires of the Rising Sun where the cards drive movement over hexes rather than point to point.  This allows for greater freedom of planning but can also lead to a-historic situations.  That's not necessarily a bad thing though as the game stays fun and flows well.  Both sides need to focus on their strengths at the time.  The Germans need to blitz early and hard, the Russians need to fall back and bide their time before the turn of the tide can occur.  The cards seen to work well in keeping the flow of the war on the East Front within the context of history.

Globalement je pense que Stalin's war est raté. 
Il y a une foule de régles spéciales: en fonction des tours et des zones sur la cartes, pour les conditions de victoires, enfin pour tout...
La ligne de front ne ressemble à rien, des grosses piles embusquées dans tous les mauvais terrains avec des vides de deux hex entre.
On ne joue presque jamais un événement, à part les renforts, ou alors de maniére artificielle pour annuler le malus d'opérations consécutives. Un de mes adversaire a joué un " Partisan sweep" alors que je n'avais aucun partisan juste pour remettre à zéro le malus d'Ops!
Une zone grande comme la France comprenant Moscou, Léningrad et de nombreuses autres villes importantes peut se retrouver instantanement non ravitaillé parce qu'un pion de panzer coupe une voie ferrée vers l'Oural.

La moindre petite erreur ou jet de dés improbable et la partie est perdu d'une maniére abracadabrantesque.

J'ai joué mes trois premiére parties avec le Soviétique , les trois fois j'ai pu piéger l'Allemand trop confiant et les régles de ravitaillement trés dures ont fait qu'il n'a jamais pu se dégager, ce qui m'a valu trois victoires au tour 2 !!! Mais ce n'était qu'un effet de surprise car il existe une stratégie consistant à ne jouer presqu'aucun événement qui gagne à coup sur avec l'Allemand. 

Enfin le matériel est joli, surtout la carte, mais il faut soulever les pions pour voir si une ville n'est pas cachée dessous.

Je vous conseille fortement "No retreat", avec un systéme astucieux, trés subtil tactiquement et avec de vrais choix stratégiques. J'attaque Moscou si je veux et pas si j'ai eu la possibilité de jouer la carte qui m'y autorise.

Pour comparer: 
-mise en place de SW 30 minutes au moins, NR 4 minutes.
-un tour de jeu: SW 50', NR 10'.
-consultation des régles: SW, toujours avoir le livret sous la mains; NR, vous pouvez le perdre aprés trois parties.
-suspens: SW, sur la table de combat il y a des colones où vous faites 1 perte quel que soit le jet de dé, par contre avec la carte Kamfgruppe un corps de blindé affaibli est invincible même contre deux armées et six corps commandés par Zukov! A NR les résultats sont variés notament grace aux cartes mais sans que cela devienne du n'importe quoi.

Et je pourrai continuer comme ça pendant longtemps, mais j'ai trop aimé les autres jeux de Ted Raicer pour étre méchant.

Je mets quand même 5 car j'ai quand même pris un certain plaisir à jouer, surtout au niveau tactique.

Wow, this game takes a while. Given, it was a learning game, but it really felt like the game would last a while even between experienced players. It is good at emulating the Eastern Front, however - the problem is that the Eastern Front involves a lot of attrition, which doesn't make for great gameplay.

I really like the theory behind the game, but compare it to playing a few games of Twilight Struggle or Commands & Colours, and I will pick the other games every time. I'll reevaluate the game when I get a chance, but it left me feeling uninspired after the first play.

I found it very interesting. First game which combines hexes and cards with Ops I have ever played. I do not like one thing in it. I cannot understand why there is no separate unit for Warsaw Uprising. Instead you are forced to play Soviet partisans. Warsaw Uprising was caused by Home Army, which was loyal to Polish Government in Exile and it had nothing in common with polish communists, which were controlled by Bolshevik regime.

In Verrater we each belong to one of two alliances.  These alliances are at war and each turn two adjacent tracts of land are fought over.  Players can contribute supplies to the battle and the strongest alliance wins, its members gaining victory points.  So far so so.  Role selection adds  spice, with the Verrater (traitor) changing a player's allegiance and adding tension and uncertainty to every battle. End game scoring for building estates also adds interest.  There's a tricky balancing act between points now for battles won and points at the end.

The cards are of reasonable quality, the artwork is rather lovely.  I hope that one day someone will write a clear, readable translation of the rules.

This game is pretty good. It almost has the potential to be more fun than its cousin Meuterer. But the game mechanic of the Gusthafs and the Contors is really unpleasant. Without that this game would be much better.

RATING: 7.5
I like the idea of Verraeter better than Meuterer, but there seems a problem with the gameplay here: often mid-way in the game, most if not all players will be eneding up in one faction, and thus revolts will be futile.

Lack of component.

I haven&#039;t played this one since the slew of plays it got when it first came out.  I suspect my rating will drop if/when I play it again.  For one, there&#039;s a little meanness to it (which I&#039;m not against, most of the time).  And there&#039;s also a runaway leader/loser can&#039;t catch up problem that can hit really early - which is deadly.  Still, a wonderfully novel game, great art, nice mechanics, and all packed in a card box for cheap.  Hard to beat that.

Card / board game that can feel a bit chaotic.  It has interesting mechanisms for resolving game play and players are presented with good game choices.  It lacks a feeling of robustness, but not due to balance or to other obvious faults.  Left wanting just something a little bit more.  Perhaps expectations were higher than they should have been.

Comparing Verrater to it&#039;s younger brother Meuterer is probably unfair...but I&#039;m going to do it anyway. It&#039;s not a bad game but it seems more fiddly, likely because of the more random role selection. While Meuterer might be more difficult to grasp, I think Verrater is more difficult to enjoy...

Impossible not to compare with its son, Meuterer, but the truth is that they are not too similar, except in the role selection and fighting mechanics (and of course lay-out).  This is more direct game, no trading, just fight!  Very interesting, very portable, really worth having even if you have Meuterer.  BOTH are just GREAT.

This was a gift from my 2011 AU/NZ BGG Secret Santa.

A very good game, lots of difficult decisions, bluffing and reading your opponents. The role selection seems to work well and all of the roles seem to be chosen more-or-less equally.

I wonder however if the game would not be better if the supply cards are initially played face-down.

Feeling very similar to Meuterer (perhaps not quite as good though), this also has the redeeming feature of being very cheap and very portable.

The constantly switching allegiance is nice - being part of the majority wins you more battles but you score less for each one you win, and of course it is important to keep picking up points from the roles you select.

This card game plays like a board game.  Everyone chooses a role (kind of like Citadels) and then a battle is fought over which faction will control a land card.  I always miss the swing of the game and lose (or maybe everyone is plotting against me).

RATING: 7
A very interesting board game that comes in a card game box.  A sharp battle of political intrigue where your partner at the beginning of this turn could be your enemy at the end.  Picking roles in a unique manner where turn order yields how much information you have, balanced against the order in which you play supply cards where the last player then has the final play.  Best with 4 players.

Acquérir des points de victoire en soutenant le parti vainqueur. Deux grandes familles, dont les armes sont l'Aigle et la Rose, tentent d'annexer les plus riches et les plus vastes territoires. Les joueurs, représentant la petite noblesse, combattent tantot pour un camp, tantot pour l'autre. Il n'est pas rare de voir un traitre retourner sa veste en pleine bataille. Pendant ce temps, d'autres construisent greniers et comptoirs marchands, d'autres encore usent de diplomatie pour sauver ce qui peut l'etre, ou, prévoyants, se consacrent a l'agriculture.

Neat little title of double think and back stabbery that manages to squeeze into a very short time frame. The core role selection mechanism present here was later reused in Meuterer and Citadels, which I dislike and despise respectively. Verraeter works because the game is so focused: there is a conflict each round, and all of the roles affect that conflict by giving you combat bonuses, by allowing you to switch sides, or by allowing you to choose where the next round's conflict will occur, which is important because each area will give one side or another the advantage.

Though the game is guesswork to a large degree, one can generally think out the current game state, and figure out the best course of action. Granted, people can throw a spanner in the works by making a crazy choice that one didn't see coming, but that's all part of the fun.

As I said, of the "role selection card game" family, this is the one that I like. It's more calculational with less chaotic hose-beastage than Citadels, and it's much more focused than Meuterer, which has a trade phase grafted onto the Verraeter engine and hurts it. The low price on this makes it an easy choice too, fun little game, will likely see plenty of play in the future.

Production: Simple art; elegant iconography.  Play: The roles are well-balanced, in that I found myself wanting each of them at some point in the game.  The Eagle/Rose alignment helps decrease the chaos a bit, making players a bit more predictable (only one may switch allegience, contrasted to Meuterer, in which the Captain is known, but the Captain's helper, the Mutineer, and the Mutineer's helper are all unknown).  Points are hard to come by, which makes even more crucial those roles that earn the player points.  Overall the game is easier to learn and quicker playing than Meuterer, and I would rank it third in the Citadels and Meuterer family, but still the game is enjoyable enough that I would gladly play again.  (2+1+3) (1 play)

This one's slipped a bit for me as I've noticed that there's usually one person who gets screwed within the first three rounds and there's not a lot they can do to catch up.  That being said, it's still a great game of second guessing and plotting.  The soldier does breathe a nice new twist into it as well.

Four player boardgame, in the form of a deck of cards. Players are sided with one of two factions and each round must do battle over an area of land. The winners receive a share of victory points.

I'm glad I got the chance to try this out.  I never knew it existed, but a friend was kind enough to bring it over and let us know that this is the grand-daddy of hidden-role games (a la Citadels).

There's a great "betray your team" aspect to this in order to score the most points and with the table-talk, it's definitely a gamble, which is fun.  The only hit against this is that I don't really see a way to catch up to a points-leader if they continue to get in the right position.  2 were blown away by almost double the points of 1.

Maybe we just suck.

A close relative of Meuterer which is by no means a bad thing.  The decisions required have to be balanced by the need to pull ahead of your sometimes allies.  The conflict resolution leaves room for backstabbing and intrigue to the very end.  Hand management is key as the cards in hand can be turned into a deadly strike for a solo victory in a key conflict or for points at the end game (with Kontors).  Fun and fast.

The character choosing mechanism (which later appeared in Citadels of course) is in its element here, and more so because every character has a direct effect on the game.

Acquired 05/03/06


DISCLAIMER:  I own this game, but have only played the AI version.

I like it, but almost too much emphasis is put on what the Traitor does (appropriately enough, I suppose).  Lots of games I've played against the AI, the game devolves with little hope of rescue.  This isn't a big deal when you're spending five minutes on the computer version, but to sit down for 30-45 minutes to get the game into a bogged down (4 vs 0, or hopeless 1 vs 3 with a long time before the 1 can choose traitor)...that would be tough.


I will re-evaluate when I play the real version with other players, this has been surprisingly tough to get to the table even though I've brought it to two gamedays.


EDIT:  The game is MUCH better with humans.  I think the game is not as fun with optimal play, it adds chaos.  I'm almost tempted to bump up my rating, but I'll play it again to see.  It's over very quickly, even face to face...things get interesting, and then it's over.

Wasn't sure what to expect from this game. In the end, I think I enjoyed it quite a bit! It's interesting to play the game that formulated the hidden role selection mechanic that became popular in games like Citadels. It's got an interesting "switch sides" mechanic as well to try to capitalize on the points that are about to be earned. But foregoing points to take advantage of other roles is also a good way to go. Some bluffing can work too in order to get other players to invest their resources in a battle which you'll benefit from as well. So in the end, this game creates some very interesting dynamics, which is pretty good considering this is only a deck of cards. Well done, Casasola Merkle!

Rated with the designer's updated rule:

If (and only if) all players are on the same team, then the Diplomat +5 switches sides, like the Traitor.  (They switch irrespective of whether the Traitor is played, and do not get the traitor's 1 VP, but that +5 increases the odds of being on the winning side.)

This makes it a great, tense game.

Even with the rule change, I would only play this with 4P.

I like Meuterer/Mutineer a bit better, but this one's still a lot of fun.  It seems a bit more involved than Meuterer, so choose Verräter if you want a heavy card game, or Meuterer for a moderately heavy card game.  Similar in style to Meuterer, but still a very unique animal.

A really great strategic game once everyone "gets" it. My first few games went over like a lead balloon, but now that I've played with a different crowd, I really appreciate it more. Excellent choices to make, one must always keep in mind the balance between what is the best scoring move, and what is the most likely successful move. The limited turns accentuate that problem.

An original little game in a box no bigger than the pack of cards it consists of.

For a card game, this is a cool little game.  I’ve only played on the computer so far and know it will be much better in person and have taken that into account in my rating.  I found it hard actually to anticpate what is going to happen in the conflict and act accordingly, maybe too hard not sure but I like how alliances change and the intrigue of the whole conflict phase which is where most the points come from.  I do wonder if just a little something is missing or if you just need a touch more info going into the conflict.  Now I want to play Meuterer to compare which is apparently even more liked.

Initial rating: 5.0 (January 2017)

I bought Verräter on May 2014 so it took me almost 4 years to finally play it :D. When I bought it, I was very happy because a friend told me that Verräter (along Meuterer) were excellent games, but they never really clicked with me. Besides, I like Die Kutschfahrt zur Teufelsburg which is from the same publisher and it comes with the same format. I recognize they can be fun games to play if you are willing to explore them, but I´m not.

Verräter´s rules are a little hard to grasp from the rulebook, but once you understand them, you can teach them under 6 minutes. They aren’t very complex. Playtime is under 60 minutes.

The art of the cards is ok, nothing special though.

Best with 4 players, but Verräter is much more group dependent than most.

Gameplay is, more or less, boring. In each turn you have to pick the best role available to you. There are several roles and each one has a different power. The decisions needed to play the game aren’t hard nor easy. Verräter has a light-medium weight. The battles aren´t very fun to play. Most times the result is assured and very lopsided, but sometimes they can finish in an unexpected way. The traitor role is the most fun to play and finding who is going to betray this turn is what the whole game is all about (which is fitting as the game means traitor in German).

The luck of the draw is high and it bothers me. Besides that, sometimes you just need a role and, even if you are first, you cannot take it as a random role is left out each turn. 

Bottom line, I find Verräter a boring endeavor (as I did Meuterer). I get the game is old and well respected but it doesn’t work for me. I already sold it as my desire to play it again was very low.

Current Rating:  4.0

RATING: 8.5
This is a card game that has a role selection very similar to Citadels (in fact this is the game that inspired that part of Citadels), and involves battles between two medieval German families.

It has a "team with your enemy" tension and dynamic that actually felt very similar to Medina and that I really enjoyed. And then there's the awesomeness of the title character, where you can turn traitor and join the opposing family. It really is a lot of game for such a small box (just a deck of cards).

I'm surprised there hasn't been an English edition of this, seeing as what a perpetual hit Citadels is and how cheap a deck of cards would be to produce. And even despite the traitor aspect I would see this one as even less "nasty" than Citadels and so perhaps more accessible. I could see it being a stocking stuffer hit a la Saboteur.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An simplified warfare card game with some very interesting ideas. The game is quite simple to play, with some elements of bluffing, and of course a traitor. The role-selection mechanism slows the game down considerably (since the other players have nothing to do while waiting), but the problem here isn't as pronounced as it is in Citadels.

An extra half-point for portablity.

This is a pretty cool role selection game in the same vein as Citadels except it has you and your opponents forming teams and breaking alliances. The only downside is that you have to write down the score after every round so one person could effectively be out of the game or one person could be out of reach. That said, it's really fun and compact, perfect throw in a bag on a trip or even just put in your pocket.

RATING: 7
Similarly to its younger brother Meuterer, in Verräter there are some minor problems, like having the Verräter thrice in a row out of consideration group and the game could be clearly decided before the last turn. Risk levels in this game are really high, while Meuterer is more forgiving and smoother. I prefer Citadels.

For a while I've thought that Citadels is a brilliant idea implemented in a way that isn't flawed exactly, but which doesn't lead to satisfying gameplay. Apparently Verräter is where the idea originates, and may also be the game that makes the best use of it. It's a short, brutal affair full of opportunism and second-guessing. I do see some potential problems with it. First, the brevity means it's very hard to recover from a blow; someone's likely to be betrayed in the first round and may then be shut into a worthless position for two or three rounds. You can always hope the leader will subsequently be shafted, but it's unlikely that everyone else will. Second, the game may dry up with everyone on the same team, grinding to a halt while people scrabble for points from other sources; this may be addressed by the rules update. Third, the game needs to be played with attention to deltas; if someone's content to collect points in league with the leader they're likely to hand over the game. I need to play more.

[2007.Apr.12] Verräter--which translates to "traitor" in English--is another classic Adlung-Spiele game designed by Marcel-André Casasola Merkle. Like its more recent cousin [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/902]Meuterer[/url] (by the same game designer), Verräter is a German card-based game that includes bluffing, hand management, and role selection among its key attributes. Unlike Meuterer, this game is much more analytical in that it requires each player to track conflict points during a turn and make decisions based upon what roles may or may not have been taken by other players. Nonetheless, Verräter is a good game when played with 4 players.

UPDATE: Haven't been playing it lately, and feel no great desire to, although I will if asked.  Still, I've dropped my rating to 6.

Played only against a computer :) It's a good game. Role selection is very entertaining. My only problem comes from the fact that as soon as the 4 players "support" the same side there is no good reason to be a traitor since it's almost impossible to win a 3 against 1 battle. 

If you are behind the leader, it's tough to come back. All players will need to gang up against the leader which is not easy to do if you are on the same team as the leader.

Anyway it's probably the best game for your buck! And it's portable too!

Land districts are laid out in a circle. Players have an allegiance to roses or eagles and fight over a district. Players choose roles (builder, diplomat, etc), but the verrater, or traitor can switch sides.  If you like unpredictability (who is the traitor and will they change sides?), then you might like this game. This card game had some neat mechanics.

It's a very meaty card game, but a lot of decision making in Verräter is based on guesswork. If you're early in the round you need to guess what other players' characters and intentions are, and whether your partner(s) will back you up and play cards accordingly. If you're last in the round, you're guessing who's taken what characters - who took the 5-Diplomat, the 2-Diplomat, the Traitor. Some of that guesswork may be based on position, and some may be psychological. I can understand why that's interesting and enjoyable for a lot of gamers, and I don't mind working through that process in a game myself, but in the end I don't find it satisfying, right or wrong, because it was, after all, guesswork. And when a player hasn't done what was clearly best for themselves, leaving your guesswork in the lurch, you get that unsatisfying  Nicht Die Bohne "why didn't you do that" feeling. Followed by the realisation that you've just landed yourself a big problem getting back into the game given the catch a leader problem.

Losing the first two rounds and falling behind in Verräter can be deathly for the rest of the game. If you then choose to be the Traitor and join the strong side, you don't gain ground against the leaders as you score the same as them. Eventually one of the leaders will change to your side in order to go for the victory, but again, you're not catching them. So you have to swap sides - but then you've joined with the other leader and can't catch them either! So ... decent, but issues.

RATING: 8
well... this is an excellent game. It gave birth to Meuterer and inspired Bruno Faidutti in adapting its character select system to Citadels. I had all three of those! Citadels though is a whole different story, no possible comparison, very different game. Meuterer though is another issue. Both are exactly the same in terms of preparation, character select system, and in the main idea: backstabbing! I felt it was somewhat redundant to have both games, since I consider Meuterer to be the better of both (it was fine-tuned, has a well adapted theme, and a better integrated playing mechanism) I traded verrater and kept meuterer... it got me Colossal Arena which in its turn got me Lord of the Rings: pretty good trade I think :)

I decided to get a new copy in the end because it is an important game because of its contribution to the board game industry.

A pleasant surprise! Why this is *much* better than Citadels (they share the same secret role selection mechanism):

[1] When players are deciding which role card to pick, they are taking into consideration much less than Citadels; each player is trying to be on the winning side of the current conflict, and/or improve their situation for upcoming conflicts. This makes it *much* easier -- and feasible -- to try to deduce what your opponents have picked.

[2] Players do not reveal their secretly picked roles right away; they try to influence the outcome of the conflict before doing that. Because of this, you *have* to try to deduce what roles your opponents have picked. This makes this game far more interactive than Citadels.

[3] Both Citadels and Verrater have the worst kind of downtime: You cannot plan your moves until opponents who play earlier than you finish picking their roles. Because roles are secretly picked, you can't even watch your opponents thought process; you can't read their minds. At least Verrater limits the number of players to four. (I've tried Citadels with 6+ players and the downtime is intolerable.)

Flaws: 

[1] A small fault for me: This game requires (for me) a bit of mental arithmetic since you have to constantly re-evaluate the numerical strengths of both sides of each conflict.

[2] As mentioned before, this game has the worst kind of downtime.

Secretly choosing the character/action cards (particularly the traitor) is a very effective mechanic. I always find the open playing of supply cards a little too much like number crunching. Also, the game finishes too quickly and allows a players leading in round one to stay ahead easily. Needs to be played in 3 rounds for 4 players or first to 30VP.

For a small game that packs a big punch this just isn't brought to the table enough. One reason is that it really does require exactly four players to work well. Another is that despite its simplicity it proves to be a bit of a rules hurdle when not regularly played. The game is simple, and if you don't mind games where you can expect to be bashed if you're the leader then this is a decent game to take on your holidays.

Packs alot of punch in a little cardbox. Players start with either the Rose or Eagle faction and each turn a battle between two opposing faction cities are resolved. Roles are selected. These give players abilities, extra combat cards, turncoat, etc. Once battle cards have been commited, players reveal the role cards and these take effect.

A game that's full of tension and choosing the right role can be agony. Much faster playing and perhaps even more fun than Citadels (which took the role selection idea from this game).

Best with four players though.

Has not aged well for me. Has gone from a '9' to a '7' to its current position at '5' There were several times when I wanted to make a clever move -- but the card I needed to make it was not available to me. So I ended up doing not exactly what I wanted to do and feeling somewhat helpless. It's also hard to fight your way out of last place, since most of the time at least one other person is going to be scoring the same number of points as you. At least it felt that way. On the other hand, the game did inspire Citadels, and for that I'm glad.

Thats a lot of game for a deck of cards. Simple to play, so much so that this makes a good family game. I enjoy the secret role drawing more in this than in Citadels.
Sold 2016 - only played once, and thought it was ok then.

Interesting game because of "The Traitor" Action Card which allows to switch the side of the conflict. Because of that the situation in the game can be much changed and it could be a way to be a winner. The best variant is for 4 players.

Pretty interesting game where allegiances change throughout the game.  We mostly fumbled around the first play doing the obvious things, but it is clear that there is a deeper game here.  Eager to try again.

After 2 plays, this still needs to hit the table more often. There's definitely a lot of strategy available though it's also entirely possible for you to bury yourself completely.

It remains nicely tense and interesting, both of which are good things.

Rating up from 6.5 to 7.2.

Update: In our group, at least, it also seems to suffer from a runaway winner problem. I suspect this is in part due to poor/inexperienced play but I can't really see this hitting the table frequently enough to gain a group of experienced players.

Great game, a lot heavier than the deck of cards would suggest. Sometimes though, the leader can make it impossible to get caught by staying in the same team as the nearest runner-up. This makes the final rounds a bit frustrating.

RATING: 8
Deeper and more complex than its younger brother, Meuterer.  I don't think it plays quite as well, but it's still a heck of a game.  And it's about the same in size as (and only slightly more in cost than) a pack of smokes.  Highly recommended.

An interesting game of shifting alliances. Verrater is definitely one of the top all-time offerings from Adlung. A lot of fun packed into a very small card box, and a terrific value given its original cost.

A brilliant 'board game in a card game'. It can be very daunting for the new player, but packs a lot of game into the little box.

RATING: 6
This game is pretty simple to play, and fun, but seems tougher than it is because 1) the cards are all in German, and 2) there are 13 phases. In practice, laying out the rules this way leaves no doubt as to how the game is played. Too bad I waited over 2 years before finally getting it onto the table.

Owned this one for awhile now. Finally got a chance to play it and it's an amazing game. I love this little game. I love the character role selection. I love the timing. Take some risks and they might pay off. Hold your cards and then BAM score major points when you switch sides. Lots going on in this one.

RATING: 6.5
7 rating is focused on what I like and trying to assume the best about the things I'm skeptical about.

I like this better than Meuterer because there's a much greater feeling of long-term strategy and narrative, as opposed to Meuterer's feeling of being a series of isolated rounds. (That said: Meuterer makes me think "this is clever" more than Verrater does.)

I feel like I often want to do a number of things, but can only do one, and another player might take my preferred choice away from me, forcing me to do something I need at a later time. It's nice. On the other hand the game is pretty short, so there may not be time to do what I need and then I feel like I didn't get a fair shot.

It's strange how one side (Eagles vs. Roses) can dominate and threaten a "whole world got conquered" end-of-game that everyone sees in advance, and that most players want to delay, while finding it difficult to do that because the necessary actions won't have been advantageous if they don't work!

Despite this drama the end result was a little disappointing in the first game. A 4p game, the two players that started as Rose never flipped sides, Rose conquered the board on the last turn, and these two players were tied in score.

I think this might have passed under the radar of its target audience being that it's packaged as a card game when in truth it plays like a middle-to-heavy weight boardgame. This is one of the best implementations I have seen of the role selction mechanism, as it really offers very difficult decisions owing to the many things one needs/wants to do as well as things one wants the other players NOT to do... this would be rated higher if it weren't for the rigid scoring opportunities - these make it easy for a player to be in a position where s/he cannot make a comeback from a devastating loss. Also be warned: Verrater may not be *understood* by persons hung up on loyalty or that are too non-confrontational, as after all it does mean "traitor" in German. So at the end of the day even though I think this has the makings of a great game, it falls flat because the alliance mechanic is too granular to really work, and the game is fragile insofar as it really requires the right type of personality to work.

This is a sister game to Meuterer and plays similar-ish on land with the circular lay out of discovery areas.  This game selects roles before card play and conflict occurs between neighboring areas as a couple of notable differences. Two houses (Eagle and Rose) you can side with. Both are given credit as inspiration for player roles mechanic used in Citadels and Puerto Rico.

i think that many games have gone down the track of creating a board game with elements of card play. but to create a card game that feels as deep and as fun as a board game that you can throw in your back pocket is great. however, meuterer has developed from this game and IMHO is the better of the two.

Played once face-to-face and a few times on BSW (mainly with 4 players). While it may not be as refined as in Meuterer, I like the basic idea of character selection. There are lots of other good ideas in this game, still it does not feel as satisfying as it should. The card values might be a bit extreme (from 2 to 6, with a single and very powerful 8), and the game only really works with 4 (unlike Meuterer, which is still decent with 3).

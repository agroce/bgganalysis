An original and interactive game about trading tea in ancient China.

The game consists of 2 major parts, an auction for improving your abilities as a trader, and a travelling phase where you set out to the regions to sell/trade your tea.  The goal is to make the most points by game end, which is variable in length as it ends when either a player hits 80 points or when all of the gifts are distributed.  During the game you will want to generate income but this income you generate can also be converted directly to cash at the time you make it, so you need to decide when and how much to convert and this is critical throughout the game.

The auction phase consists of using available traders to bid for improving abilities, all of which are good.  The twist is that you can try to go cheap but you can be outbid, however if you pay a middling price, you are guaranteed the ability, and of course you could always pay even more if someone has already taken the middling price.  The abilities are: 1) more traders, which allows for more bidding options and more travelling options, 2) more border passes, which is essentially more movement points for when your traders travel (also the more you progress the more end game points you will get), 3) more range with your horse, which dictates which provinces you can actually move into (the farther out the better), 4) influence, which allows you to "bump" out traders in regions you move into (the more you progress the more end game points you will get), 5) build buildings, of which there are 3 types and which are in limited supply (1 type is a source of end game points as well).  There is also the option of banking, where you forfeit acquiring abilities and instead take income based on the sum of all players auction bids.

The travel phase consists of moving your traders on the board based on their border passes, and setting up a continuous trade route.  The farther out you get the more lucrative the payouts, but this is difficult to achieve.  After all players have done this, the tea inspector will travel out to the highest paying region and "bump" a player (the one with the highest influence, in other words he bullies the bully), and then gifts (small point tokens) are distributed, if available to players in the provinces containing them (remember this is an end game condition as well).  Players then take their tea income, making to sure to pay any penalties for a disrupted tea network (disrupted through other players and/or the tea inspector bumping them) and then choose to convert into cash and/or points at a 1:1 ratio.  Early you want cash, but at what point and how much do you decide to go for points, that's the big question.

The game says it plays 2-5 players, but really it only seems to a 3-5 player game as the 2-player rules seem forced and have you play 2 colours at a time, never a good solution, unfortunately.  This is a very unique game and is definitely worth more plays, rating could go up.  Vaguely reminiscent of Hansa Teutonica but very different in its own right.

Looks really nice, but rules do not convince me. Why not?

- a lot of administrative workload to do
- a lot of exact calculating ahead needed durng game (AP likely)
- high frustration potential through kicking mechanism (also kingmaking problem)
- nothing really new or interesting in mechanics
- overall seems to be a rather dry VP calculation game with some (partly arbitrary) damaging each other mechanism added

RATING: 8.9
Simply superb design.  No random elements, pure strategy.  Better than that, it is a game that absolutely requires that you take into account the actions of your opponent--very hard to turn this one into a game of multiplayer solitaire.  I'd like to get this to the table more to investigate some stated concerns (among my play group) with initial turn order granting disproportionately favorable chances of ultimate victory, and the extent that could be counter-acted by alternative strategies.  

In some ways, the auction component acts as a de facto worker placement, where many players tend to stick with 'guaranteed bids.'  However, this makes turn order and the advanced rules (permitting debt) even more important, as it allows for some really interesting game choices to prevent later players in the turn order from sneaking progress at a steep discount--particularly if bidding up other players is combined with the creative use of the bank spaces.

A pretty much themeless game, which is sad, since I'm a fan of Yunnan tea! Even Darjeeling is a better-themed game!

But Yunnan itself is a very well-done, medium-heavy game, with only a few minor glitches. Certainly, the game becomes smooth-flowing mid-way through your first game, but the rules are way too intricate to introduce this to casual gamers, and there are no player aids. It can potentially be AP heavy, as every little thing a player does is important. My only other complaint is the unnecessarily convoluted turn-order mechanism: it works, and keeps players nicely balanced, but man, it's hard to keep track!

There's no way you can win without a sound strategy: BUT, slavish devotion to your strategy will be your doom! I think this is what has led some gamers to complain about screwage in Yunnan: their precious strategy is suddenly marred by some ne'er-do-well. Now I hate games that are cutthroat:  but it doesn’t bother me at all in Yunnan, because the very nature of the game requires one to take into account the potential for an “attack” with every move. “HA! I’ve bumped you back into Pu’Er!” “Right, I had been assuming you’d do that…which allows me to do THIS!” In other words, work out a strategy; but play out each turn tactically.
 
Yunnan is just the right length for what it offers.

I love this game. Of all the games I played in 2013 and 2014 this was my favorite. Yunnan combines worker placement, area movement, auctioning, and risk management in an elegant and interesting way. The many different mechanics at work can sometimes be confusing, but knowing the right time to switch focus from earning money and improving your trade network to gathering victory points is the key to winning the game.

I bought the german language version as it was the only one available when the game was initially released, and downloaded the english rules.

:d10-4:

10/16: This one is growing on me. I'm excited to see how the metagame will develop once everyone playing has a half dozen plays under their belts. Also, this is clearly going to be a more interesting (controllable) game at lower player counts. My plays at 5 have been fine for learning the basic strategy, but will be unsatisfying in just a play or two. Although many people say that 3 players is too few, so... 4 it is?

9/16: I retract my earlier opinion of the influence mechanic. While I still find it at odds with the rest of the design, it clearly isn't to prevent a runaway leader. The money vs. VP question has a pretty clear "money early, VPs late" answer. I guess the only question is when to make that switch, as it depends on when you think the game will end or if you will be the one to end it. Connection rules are poorly written in the rulebook, and easy to overlook while playing. I imagine this gets easier with experience. While I still rate this a 6, I could see it going up with more play.

10/13: The influence mechanic seems tacked on for runaway leader issues, and creates feel-bad moments that are at odd with the rest of the game. The rest of the game is a fairly straightforward worker placement game with a bit of Power Grid's "hold back the whole game until it is advantageous to jump forward". Would play quickly with an experienced group - possibly 45 minutes.

First Play: Four players and the rules are quite straightforward although the strategies are not so obvious from the start. Players are very much in each others faces, knocking pieces back by overbidding or undermining board positions to make then return to base with minimum income. The game has a tipping point when you decide to take more VPs than money with you round score. I felt this aspect similar to 'Upon a Salty Ocean' where if you make the break first and get it right you will win by a very healthy margin, get it wrong and you will probably come last. 

A very carefully balanced game and I look forward to playing again.

Next outing with 4 new players and myself, there was outrage that the game ended so quickly, they hadn't seen it coming. As a result they demanded a rematch. The second game with 5 took 60 minutes and whipped along. An excellent game.

RATING: 8.5
This is one of those games that reveals itself after a few plays. The rules are simple enough to understand, but the gameplay is meaty and deep. It is luckless with no elements left to chance and although there are tactical aspects to it there is a strategical depth that belies it's simple façade.

The game seems to be balanced with the different strategies to be employed. In the plays that I have had, there have been different winning methods leading me to an engrossing time and anxious to discover more of it's depth. 

For this being the designer's (Aaron Haag) first outing, it is an impressive debut and I'm hopefully looking forward to whatever else he has to offer.

I like the ideas in the game and it feels like it could be really good.  I played with just 3 players (I think the game wants 4) and we messed up a rule about what a broken connection means which had a significant impact on the game.  It's auctions and building a connection on the map to deliver tea and buying points with income at the end of each turn.  I need to play it again to know how I really feel, but I think there is a good game in here.

How exciting, yet another soulless and dry game with a pasted-on boring theme!

When looking at the game objectively, I should probably like the game. It’s rather short, there isn’t a whole lot of luck involved and it has a fair amount of player interaction. However, I really, really didn’t like my one play through. The game has an awful amount of AP (though I admit that I did play with players who are somewhat prone to AP when there isn’t a lot of luck so you can calculate the outcome). Overall Yunnan is very boring. The gameplay is simply dull, you don’t really do much on your turn, and there is waaaaay too much calculation going on among the players which really bogs down the game. The game can actually be over quite quickly if a player speeds up the game, which happened in our game, but it also meant that some of the players got caught off guard because the game ended so suddenly. 

To me, the biggest plus in Yunnan is the way scoring works; you get points in each round, but you have to decide if you take them as straight up points or income which will help you in the next round. This means that after a few rounds you shift from getting income to getting points, and this can rapidly end the game.

Yunnan also has a big chunk of screwage thrown into the gameplay, which just enhances the AP as players need to think what they themselves can do as well as every opponent, especially because turn order is also very important when resolving your actions… So while I love the interaction in Hansa Teutonica or games like that, I don’t think it works in this game. It’s simply too important what the other players decide to do.

Very very nice game. One of those games where after the first game everyone wanted to just chat about it, what went right and wrong, what could have been, etc. It's an auction game where players are bidding on multiple things simultaneously, and multiple people can win, but at different prices. There is also an interesting system where the cheapest two bids are considered "small", and unlike the "large" bids, only survive if no one outbids. There is also an interesting escape hatch from the bidding process if you find that things are getting too expensive, and you'd rather [i]make money[/i] rather than [i]spend money[/i], but of course you don't get anything. There is significant tension over whether anyone will bail, and if so when, because if someone bails, all their bidding spots are freed up (you can underbid someone else and still get the item being bid for, so long as the under-bid is "large"). 

In our first game, some people felt a little hurt at the nastiness, but that was all but gone on the second game, where people are focusing on themselves, and if they hose someone in the process, that's just collateral damage. But there are choices of whom to hose sometimes, so there is a bit of bash the leader, which one player didn't like. The score track does not accurately represent the leader, so if someone is not accurately evaluating the board, they can accidentally whack the "wrong" player.

Overall very nice system. One of those "everything is good, and you want more of everything" games, but how you use what you have is the key.

This game succeeds in my "are there opportunities for clever moves?" test. My one beef is that there is zero randomness, even in setup.

RATING: 5
Although the author in all likelihood didn't design Yunnan in the way I am about to describe, I found it very helpful to think of the game as a reimagined Caylus. To make 1 Yunnan you take 1 Caylus, and then:

— remove all custom buildings, residences and prestige stuff, as well as royal favours and the castle;
— turn the pink buildings into fixed buildings and call them ‘provinces’;
— you can only walk to a province based on a certain number of movement points, provided your horsie has already been there before (and the horsie only moves towards more remote areas);
— you may build shortcuts between provinces;
— having a meeple in a province just nets you a fixed amount of tea points;
— you can build other contraptions in a province like a trading post which counts as a permanent meeple (generating tea points) or a tea house which both yields proper VP as well as shields you from the games's ‘Provost’: the Overseer;
— ending a movement in a province entitles you to kick someone with a lower reputation out towards a province closer to home;
— at the end of every turn the ‘Provost’ visits the province generating the most tea points and kicks one trader home belonging to the player with the highest reputation (can't have the rabble think it’s more important than [i]moi[/i], of course);
— and tea points are exchanced into VP or money in any ratio the player desires. The game ends when someone goes over 80 VP, and after the turn is complete, the highest VP total wins (i.e., it's a race where you need to have sufficient momentum once you cross the finish line).
— You then alter the pre-bridge buildings to cope with the new structure: movement point increase; reputation point increase; construction; horsie movement; new meeples; and a bank;
— you add a action sequence track with an element of turn order manipulation which is graphically very well thought out (kudopoints here);
— you add a few bonus tiles to entice players to reach new provinces quickly (which is difficult because you need a connected chain towards the bridge, otherwise your trade route breaks down);
— alter the artwork;
— and call the result ‘Yunnan’.

It is surprising how effective the above recipe describes what Yunnan is about. With a few more details on how the worker placement phase functions you would be able to play the game already. [i]Had[/i] the game been explained to me in the above terms, I might have had less issues with it while sitting on an uncomfortable chair while at Spiel 2013. That said, I doubt the game's grating feel of taking three steps forward and two back when playing with 5 (as Yunnan is completely open and perfect information) would have subsided. I'm not a fan for this kind of feel, where the players are rats in a cage, all after the same target. I would be in favour of playing with less players, although I strongly suspect that if the player count drops too low, the game becomes quite boring. You need [i]some[/i] friction. 

All in all I think at this point that Yunnan is a solid title I need to revisit again in the future with less players. I'm not sure the design handles many repeat plays very well as the entire structure is geared towards manipulation of a singular transport route. Games from Splotter, the undisputed masters of this area, are [i]much[/i] more flexible in this regard. But Yunnan has the advantage of familiarity and quicker mastery.

[u]3 PLAYERS[/u]: Not yet played.
[u]4 PLAYERS[/u]: Not yet played. I expect this to be the sweet spot.
[u]5 PLAYERS[/u]: Grating feel similar to Caylus' feel at 5. Rating is 5 at best, perhaps even less.

In Yunnan, players control the fate of their tea dynasties. Their main goal is to establish a broad and secure trading network to deliver the tea to the farthest provinces, doing it better than their opponents. The main work behind the scenes is done in Pu'er, their home location: New traders need to be trained, better horses need to be acquired, and a good number of border passes need to be requested to be able to reach the farthest provinces.

There's a lot of game in this game--and it's not just a matter of a dozen different "point salad" sort of things to do. All the actions here are very integrated with one another and there's a good amount of player interaction. (Including some fairly direct "take that" interaction... which we think is great. Too many Euros have no meaningful interaction.)

When I first opened up the game, I was surprised at how few components there were, since my impression was that this was going to be a medium weight or medium-heavy game. And it is--the game accomplishes so much due to good design. Everything is nicely streamlined and works well.

The game has a very nice ebb and flow of traveling, gaining new things, and earning money. The route-building aspect of the game is not overdone... it's neatly reduced to about a dozen paths total, which makes interacting on the routes more interesting since all players are relying heavily on the same handful of routes.

Nice one!

EDIT: After a second play, I'm bumping this up half a point. The game plays out surprisingly quickly--our 5-player game ended within the stated 90 minutes, which is unheard of for our group. But the game has much more meaningful decisions than the vast majority of "quick" games.

I suspect the game would not be so good with just 3 players. The bank action--which even with 5P seems like something to only do when stuck or desperate--would have so little payout that it'd never be worth it. There would also be much less competition for action spaces (three players may always take each of those) and the routes would be far less crowded/competitive.

I also wonder about long-term replayability, since there's no variation in setup, no randomness and no hidden information. (But I think there's enough depth here for at least a dozen plays... and very possibly many more.)

EDIT: After 7 plays, we're far from thinking we're playing well--there's clearly a ton of strategy still to learn. We've added the small expansion shrine building, which is certainly excellent, too. (I'm not generally a fan of expansions, but this one is great.)

Something makes me hesitant to bump the game up to a '9'... though I can't put my finger on exactly what (maybe just that it feels like a "small" game, even though it's really not).

Underlying game is pretty solid but there was nothing here to find exciting except some fairly brutal and sometimes arbitrary take-that mechanics. Getting a piece bumped (playing 4-player) sometimes came down to simply being in the way or was determined when tied vulnerability on turn order. Taking a hit can be a real killer and put you completely out of contention. This makes it a bit too 'thinky' for what it delivers.

I can see those with a leaning towards cut-throat Euros (if that isn't an oxymoron) liking it though - think Vanuatu - a game I really dislike. If a game is going to have conflict I would prefer the gentler and more friendly    climes of a wargame.

While I liked a couple of the mechanics (e.g. being able to drive up bids and then back out to collect cash based on what everyone else bid), this game fell flat.  It presented as just another euro where you bid on elements and try to advance your pieces across a track while not doing so well that you get penalized.  Nothing stood out to make this game special.

Pretty, but not getting a post-Essen bump...might be less than it seems.

Happy to report that my initial enthusiasm was rewarded with a tight, aggressive game involving pay-to-play bidding on several improvements, shoving actions based on influence and a game cop that is nominally attacking the bully. You very quickly deduce shrewd discrete actions that punish your opponents and lure the authority to look elsewhere...

The board design is lovely and the language independent turn sequence is managed on the board requiring no referring to an icon glossary.

I'm happy that the designer choose worker placement with no player boards, it's so satisfying to take direct actions and in turn face my opponent's wrath.

Excellent.

1. az infelence akciónak nem hogy nincs sok értelme, de kifejezetten hátrányos a játékosra nézve, aki elviszi. Ezt elsőre csúnyán be lehet szívni, később meg egyszerűen nem fog rátenni soha senki. Ilyen broken mechanikát ritkán látni játékban.
2. súlyos olló effekttől szenved a játék. Aki hamar előre tud menni, annak több pénze lesz, amivel ki tudja licitálni a többieket a kulcspozíciókból, amivel tovább tudja fokozni az előnyét. Ez sajnos szintén egyértelműen tervezési hiba. 
Mindez azzal társítva, hogy kifejezetten kitolós, gonosz játékról van szó rettenetesen kellemetlen "élményt" tud okozni. Számomra érthetetlen az aránylag magas átlagpontja.

There are a few elements that I like in Yunnan. In fact, I like the basic framework as a whole, with the major decision of when to switch from generating money to generating victory points. The game is also quick enough that I don't really mind a run-away leader that can easily occur in this kind of game.

What I very much detest, however, is the possibility (or, with the game as published, necessity) of targetted attacks on other players, presumably added specifically to fix that perceived run-away leader issue. Easily turns me from interested to apathetic.

WP und Laufspiel mit gegengleichen Mechanismen und einer destruktiven, leicht aggressiven Note gegen Mitspieler. Ärgerliche, kompetitive Interaktion, gut verzahnt, wenig Spielmaterial, süße Pferde, ein schönes Brett, Aufmerksamkeit gegenüber dem Geschehen und eine kopfkratzende Rechenverwaltung im Hinterstübchen. YUNNAN hat seinen eigenen, nerdhaften Charakter, der Rätsel aufgibt und meinen Bauch erreicht. Die beste Handelsware Tee von Argentum seit HANSA TEUTONICA.

One play at the 2013 BGG.CON convinced me that this is a game worth owning. After four plays Yunnan is a solid 10 for me due to its elegance and variety of options that impact one's outcomes.  The interconnectedness of the various mechanics and the graphic design of the board has me in awe of this game.  It is really quite simple.  You start with 3 traders and can gain up to 4 more, a horse that represents the range of your traders, two each of three different "buildings" and that's it.  No cards, dice, or anything random. Regarding the two player rules, I believe there is a very good game to be had when two players understand the game and appreciate its beauty.

Two player variant seemed like it would be too much work but the game plays very quick after the first round and you grok it.

I thought we would hate the inspector or influence bumping but it doesn't feel spiteful since you can strategize around it and know what will happen before it does.

Really a good Euro and while the it does have an auction the "can't be denied" amounts allow the auction to be palatable for us. 

Theme is unique and components are not fiddly and enjoyable to handle.

Gamers game / Theme only losely connected to mechanics / calculating intensive / steep learning curve / convoluted rules.

There are things you shouldn't do in this game such as increasing your influence in the first turn. I did so and was sent back to pu'er 3 times in a row by the province inspector making me losing many points/money. This was a major set back that I could'nt catch up for the rest of the game which lead to some frustration.
Other players that tried this tactic as well reported the same consequences.
While the province inspector was meant to stop the (runaway) leader, he punishes even weakest player at the start of the game. It is hard to say "this is a flaw", as once you know it, you can deal with this rule.

Another point is: you need 80 VP to win (aka finishing the game). As in the endgame you easily end up with 50 VP in one round, the game may end very quick.

Will play againg but I don't think it has lot of replayabilty for my taste.

RATING: 7
Interesting mix of movement and tech tree, but hurt by the fiddliness of some of the phases as well as the nasty parts - bumping other players backwards and the strongest player in a region possibly being sent back. It feels like a clumsy stop-the-leader system in what is effectively a race game to 80 points with some endgame scoring.  I really wish the game helped the other players rather than bashing the leader.

Nice game where you have to be aware of many things. Problem I see, is that you have to calculate non-stop. I don't mind mathy games, but if you need to check everytime you do something, is just too much. A paradise for AP.

Also, there's a common strategy, like the money strategy in Dominion, you have to beat (theoetically).

Yet another thing I dislike is, that there isn't much of a point to score at the beginning of the game.

I would play it again, anyway.

A very unusual auction game in which timing is everything and you can choose to knock your own bid markers off their auctions to get more money. There's also an aspect of the game that involves traveling along the old road to deliver tea back home, while meanwhile avoiding the province inspector, who will send you home if he catches you making too much money.  Plenty to think about here. I really liked how original the game was, and I also enjoyed the little puzzle of figuring out where the province inspector would go and how to avoid that. (1 play)

RATING: 8.5
This is not the kind of game where you can build up to the perfect trade empire. This is a quick, and fairly mean, race game. The central mechanic is something between auctions and worker placement. It's a game of finding a rhythm and getting something good going quickly because you won't have time to make something great. And it's definitely a game I want to play more to get that rhythm just right.

Update: at first this game seemed inscrutable, and that fascinated me. Playing it more, I see there's a lot of room for interesting maneuvers, but also a slightly unsatisfying level of arbitrariness, at least early on. At the beginning, only one or two people are going to have the ability to bump others back and it might be hard to tell who's in the best position and should be reigned in, or the player might just decide the fairest thing is to hit everyone as equally as possible. But this feels like it can have huge, unforeseeable ripple effects on the game, and so it can feel a bit arbitrary. But that said, I'm still fascinated by a lot about the game and I really want to keep playing.

Borrows a little from a couple games, noticeably for me is the connection path from "Magnum Sal" (though here it has to be your own workers unlike MS where others can complete path and you pay per unit transported to each opposing worker you use), and from "Princes of Florence" for how when you collect money you can divide it any way you like between cash and/or VP's.

1st game, 3 players, I ran away (~ 90 VP gap between myself and next player) by ignoring influence and tea houses (until end of game) and instead getting all my workers into my supply early, moving my horse to the end of the road, putting a trading post in the 1st province, and building a bridge.  I don't expect to win that way and by so much again against those who have played before... would also like to try with more than 3 players, in our game it never made sense to go to the "bank".

We did not play "pro" variant, it looks way to expensive... -9VP per yuan you are short to pay for your bids in 1st round, does go down every round but you are unlikely to need these "loans" later on.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (January 2016)

It took me a long time to play Yunnan. ¿The reason?, a friend told me it was a very bad game, the worst he had played in a long time so my desire to play it plummeted. It was only saved by my obsession to never sell unplayed games, so I finally played it and I was pleasantly surprised. As it turned out, my friend played it with a very bad set of rules. I still haven’t read them, but from what they tell me, they aren’t very easy to understand from the manual, but they are pretty straightforward to understand (at least, when someone explains them). That is, they aren’t that hard to grasp. Perhaps you can do it under 20 minutes.

The game has good art and components (although I expected more components due to the price). They look gorgeous on the table.

Yunnan is a medium weight Euro game with NO LUCK (I love this). The decisions are very interesting (where to bid, how much to bid, should I go to the bank?, how to move my traders, where to build, what to build). It seems the game offers many paths to victory. About the bidding, players bid simultaneously on many things and more than one player can win the same reward (although at different prices) so this is the source of much tension, how much to pay isn’t an obvious question.

The VPs are scored a la CO2, you need to decide how much money you derive from your income and how many VPs you convert from that same income. I love this.

It also has a high dose of “nastiness” for an Euro game, but here I like it. It almost never feels personal as it is always the consequence of a move to better a player´s position, not to attack another player. Still you can take measures to avoid being hit. However players can attack the current (perceived) leader, I need to play more times to see how I feel about this.

I don’t like nor dislike the theme, however some of the game mechanisms do support it and you feel it through the game.

Bottom line, I like the game and I will keep it in my game collection (at least for now). I want to explore it further, it seems it has some hidden depth that isn´t apparent with only a few games. I love that it has zero luck, all the variance have to be provided by the players but I feel it has a high replay value.

I want to enjoy this game more. There are many things it does well. However, there is a significant dose of negative interaction. Even worse, it encourages 'gang up on the perceived leader' behavior, which naturally leads to king making. 

Otherwise it's a solid design, if not tremendously novel. For this game to work well you need to enjoy the direct needling of each other. If that's your thing then you should definitely check this out.

Most likely to rise to an 8. My gut feeling for my first play was an 8 but I'm most unsure if my positive impression holds up with repeated play. So I stick with a 7 for now.
An interactive midweight Euro. Targetted actions against other players are possible but luckily there are enough ways to either avoid or weather through them without too much harm. It's interesting that game length is determined by the players as they can decide whether they convert their income into money or VPs. At some point, the game will massively accelerate when somebody starts the switch from engine building to VP generation. I like that worker placement only is a mean to an end. The decisive element is the map-based movement / building phase. No classic as Hansa Teutonica by the same publisher but serves the same need.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not a lot of tension in the bidding since I rarely encountered a situation where I had enough money to do the base 9 buck version of the action but not enough to do the most expensive version of the action. It may have suffered from the multiplayer randomness brought on by 5 player games, but it felt like getting booted from provinces by traders of higher influence or the inspector was rarely something that was a consequence of poor tactical play and was usually just a consequence of the randomness of other players' choices. I should probably try it with 3 to get a better sense of how it plays when you should have more tactical control.

RATING: 7
In my Essen 2013 top 3. If I had to choose a fall 2013 release to play 5 games in a row with the same group, it'd be Yunnan. Would be fascinating to see how the gameplay evolves.

The auctions are fairly basic. The "all bids of 9+ win" thing looks like a neat twist, but is actually pretty unimportant. A couple of rounds in nobody will ever be bidding less than 9 for anything important, so actually the system looks much like worker placement.

The map play is where the game is at. It has just the right amount of nastiness and what at least initially feels like a huge butterfly effects. There's a basic pattern of individual players pushing forward on the map, only to be pushed back down the next turn. The vp vs. infrastructure decision is somewhat more interesting than normally due to the player-controlled ending conditions. 

After 3 plays I'm still completely unsure of what optimal play would look like, which is always interesting in a game with no randomness (even in the setup). Clearly there are a limited number of roles in the game, and the auctions on the first couple of rounds can't play out in that many different ways. But every game has veered into very different directions after that.

Don't think I'd bother playing this with fewer than 4 players though. Seems like with three the board play would lose a lot, as both the influence-kicking decisions and the manipulation of the tea inspector become easier.

This is a very well designed game.  It has a beginning, a middle and an end.  It has direct player interaction.  It has multiple paths to victory via multiple strategies that are not always immediately obvious.  It has varied and unique mechanisms that complement the game play.

Okay game; I might play it again - maybe.  Initial turn order is huge - going first or second is great while going last is very bad.  There's a runaway leader problem as once someone gets going they can't be stopped.  Also, going last is very damaging and probably can't be fully overcome to win the game.

Getting donkeys and workers is important; passports(?) only need to go to four; influence is unimportant in fact leading influence can be more detrimental than helpful.  Get tea houses out early whereever you can as they're easy and worth the same points regardless of the privince but not all players can get their full two.  They also protect against the inspector.  Huts are good because they count for continuous path so use both if possible.  Bridges don't seem critical.  Leap ahead to second to last province, build a tea house and you can camp out the rest of the game and rack up the points.

The second game proved much better using the correct turn order rules.  Still, I'm not certain if this one will see much play as people were still underwhelmed.  Timing of turning money in VPs is very important.  

=================================================

FIRST IMPRESSION (we later realized we played the turn order rules incorrectly):

This did not make a great first impression as there was a continued feeling throughout the game of the rich getting richer with little one could do about this.  I do want to try again, but we'll see - probably has to be a different group.  There is some interesting tension between using workers to improve your options versus using them to score money/points.  Later, one must decide how many of the dollars earned should be transferred into points at a 1:1 ratio.  There can be some interesting knockbacks of opposition traders if you have higher influence than them, but that can also hurt if you have the most traders in the highest producing province as you'll be targeted by the stupid tea inspector...unless you're protected by a teahouse.

Easily my favourite game released in 2013. 
The layers of player interaction do blend together perfectly. Very nicely balanced mechanics, including player turn sequence even in the first turn (one game I even had to take the bank in the first turn and ended up with no disadvantage at all). You don't see many of these 'no luck element' games that don't have a preset winning strategy just because of the very interactive nature of the game. So because of this it does not become boring at all and won't attract boring preset players who only play one particular strategy. Also if one player is playing badly it won't have a direct huge impact on one certain other player unlike in many other games.
I tend to like some small luck elements in games but this one has none of this and it doesn't bother me at all !
Might end up as my second favorite game ever, need to play it more with different people though. 
I think 4 and 5 players is the best for this game.

My first choice for the 'long round' in 2014's tourneys, currently 3 wins out of 3 !

I might have liked this game without the influence track. As it was, our 5-player game was a completely chaotic affair between players knocking each other down and the inspector kicking players back.

The auctions didn't feel interesting enough (often you'll have enough money for one auction only).

All in all, I did not enjoy the feel of the game and the constant screwing (and worrying about screwing and defending yourself).

Having said that, my play was at least entertaining. I might be convinced to try it with 3 or 4 people.

An interesting bidding and worker placement game.  Initially you can bid to advance on several tracks that give you more workers, buildings, advance your horse which allows you to move workers, build influence or get more movement points.  Actions can be cheap or expensive, but if you overbid you kick off other players.  But three locations on each track cannot be kicked off.  You can get money by going to the bank which enables you to move out workers but not advance on any tracks.  Turn order is very interesting with turn order reversing for movement from bidding.  During movement, your workers cannot be used for bidding but generate income.  Very interesting game.  First play had some rules wrong, but it seems like a solid game that plays in about 90 minutes even with 5 players.

Beyond determining initial turn order, [b][thing=143401][/thing][/b] is luckless.  And, I kid you not, initial turn order is determined (according to the rules) by dropping three player markers onto the board and placing them in order based on their nearness to the 1st player turn order spot.  Beyond that bit of silliness, [b][thing=143401][/thing][/b] is really a Chinese-themed puzzle torture and probably should not be played by AP prone individuals.  The auction phase is fairly straight forward, but the "travel phase" can get just a bit agonizing as you try to anticipate what players coming after you will do and whether they can bump your traders back a province or leave you in the richest province and vulnerable to the tax collector.

After just a single game, it is very difficult to make an assessment of this game. That does, at least, speak towards its uniqueness in the flood of new games that Essen’13 brought upon us. What sets it apart is its open-ended nature: there is no distinct script to follow, and a lot of freedom in how you go about your strategy. Our winner was the only player to formulate and stick to a clear plan; the quality of the plan might have been less consequential than the help of having any plan at all to gauge your tactical moves.

What is clear is that there are a lot of strategies; if these should turn out to be well-balanced, this might be a very good or even great game.

Update after a 3rd play: downgraded. It is just not interesting. It is all very mechanical, very much constructed. Still you will always see the rich get richer effect, the strong get stronger. 

Not bad, solid game of workerplacement and some logistics. it's a race to get 80 points, that seems to work well. Balanced and various strategies possible. Just a bit dry. Your men are running after their horse, that always needs to move ahead first, which is a bit funny. Need to explore more, but I don't think replayability is very large.

Aaron Haag's 1st design is an impressive, meaty euro combining a worker-placement/auction with route connections and ways to punish your opponents with both a displacement mechanism and the province inspector.

Every category you bid on makes you stronger in some way, you really feel you need each category but it's impossible to be strong in them all (assuming your opponent's are playing competitively). So you need to figure out a way to balance your strengths with your weaknesses, to move further along the paths through the provinces, hopefully exploiting others on the way.

Tentative rating as my biggest complaint was we had one player who got out to a lead half-way through the game. It was clear to me that we couldn't catch him. At the same time it was our first game so it's very likely this was a scenario we wouldn't allow to happen again.

I really like this game after just one play where I spent the first half of the game not knowing what I was doing. By the second half things became clearer and I understood how the various mechanics and paths to victory intermeshed. 
This is a VERY interactive game and not one for those that cannot accept being knocked back for no other reason than another player could do!
Looking forward to more plays.
The second play with 5 players completed in an hour! Just superb.

This is a game I fell in love with almost instantly. I found it at a very decent price, and just after it was published. Since then, I've been waiting to find the right ammount of players and the right people... 

It really seemed to be a blast: A medium economic worker placement euro with simple rules, very balanced, many paths to victory, no luck and meaningful interaction, but no player bashing. And it's lenght was more than affordable. The full pack!

But our first game... The explanation was OK, we got the mechanisms pretty easily, but it was hard to understand the implications of these mechanics. By the time we got something, we realized we were being heavily bashed by Quegak. He really played a perfect game.

We felt quite splashed after the game. Part of it was because of the bashing, but also we didn't feel anything special. His strategy seemed to powerful. I was somewhat dissapointed.

I started to read all coments about Yunnan from other BGG users, and I felt quite better about it: many people had a "bad" first game and then came to enjoy it, some of them a lot. And their games last under one hour!

I'm going to keep it and I will try to give it another chance. It will not be easy to find players though.

Bought at Spiel without testing because this was one of the very few Essen 2013 releases where reading the rulebook did not raise suspicions or reveal any obvious flaws. That turned out to be the right decision, since this is a brilliant design and quite unlike anything else out there.

Money is very tight, and the game end trigger is devious. The map play is brutal, and causes significant variation in production between rounds. Expect to be constantly punched in the face again and again.

We found that certain mechanics did not work as well as others and just seemed layered on. The favors caused more bad then good for the most part and on the bidding track certain actions are clearly better than others. The flow is also a bit off as you move from one track to the other we had to think of what was the next step and in which order. There was a learning curve or maybe more of a clarification curve.

This has become one of my favourite games.  No randomness, quite simple setup, reall strong interactivity (you'll rarely have your attention drift for long), all add up to one of the better games I've played.  This game seems highly underrated by most to me.  The two-player game is a bit off (you play two players each, in effect) but it's still fun.  The game is best with higher player counts (4-5) but is still good with 3.

Yunnan is an auction game about making tea.  Players are bidding on which action(s) they can perform in a turn.  Players are bidding on everything at once like Amun-Re, but here multiple players can win an auction, and a player can win multiple auctions.  The game is entirely deterministic, but that didn't bother me too much--it seemed like there were a wealth of different strategic pathways that a player could take an do well with.  The game is highly interactive, not only because of the auction, but also because the effectiveness of the traders and buildings you placed is determined by their position with respect to those of other players.  Displacement of traders and placing the Province Inspector made things a little cut-throat, but generally you could figure out what people were likely to do.  I definitely enjoyed this one.

After reading the rules, all individual items is clear, but it's hard to see 'the path to victory'; For instance after reading the rules I thought the Influence - track wouldn't be that important, but in a 5-player game it seemed to be major important, because if 4 players kick back your traders - not always because they want to, but sometimes just because they can -, you will lose a lot, certainly if it would create an underborken chain to Pu'er. 

Definitely a game you should play a couple of times to see things clear.

It's a really fantastic route building game. You first do a bidding thing to buy extra guys, buildings, skills, ect. Then you walk guys out onto the main board, and there's this interesting system where guys of lesser prestige (one of the skills you bid to upgrade) get punted backwards 1 zone. Then the big boss comes and punts the high of highest prestige in the highest production zone. Then the zones produce points and/or dollars (your choice) for each guy still standing in them, minus a penalty if some of your guys aren't in contiguous provinces after all that punting.

Yunnan is a pure, modern Euro game with perfect information (and even no variation in set up). At first, Yunnan may seem as a generic worker placement game, but the twist is that you use these workers (actually traders) as auctioneers to purchase upgrades for your tea trading network. 

Traders which you do not use for auctioning are used in your trading network to generate income. In this phase you send your traders to different provinces, where they sell tea and expel other traders from there (if your influence is high enough). Both auctions and this expel mechanism yield pretty much interaction for a Euro. For the latter, turn order is very important; the turn order mechanism is similar to PowerGrid in the sense that the best player of the previous round is in the worst position.

When your traders generate income at the end of the turn, you can decide if you want to take money (for upgrade auctions) or victory point. So this is clearly a turning point game, in which you may abruptly swing from getting your engine going to scoring victory points.

I enjoyed Yunnan very much and our 2nd and 3rd game with 3 players only took about 45 minutes, while I still took some time for a few decisions (so we did not hurry). So this can be played pretty fast (maybe as the 2nd game of the evening), but it still has a lot of tactical decisions and effects are hard to foresee because of the player interaction. Because of that I am even on the fence to rate this "medium heavy". You may criticize that the game mechanisms feel a bit abstracted from theme. Despite perfect information and no randomness, I think the game offers quite some replayability, since the different strategies can be applied with the different upgrades. The mechanism and player interaction offer much to explore in Yunnan and I think a dominant strategy is hard to find (not a bold statement in a game with auctions).

I very much like the board art work by Dennis Lohausen, but I am also a fan of the Himalayan/FarEast theme, so I am biased. The rest of the components are of very good quality: There are special trader meeples and tea and trading houses (all wooden); the coins are cardboard and have different shapes for the different nominations. In the end there are not many components and hence the game is set up very quickly.

Only one play so I am not sure if this should actually rate an 8. It looks in a lot of ways like a typical build up your income weightier euro but it has two elements that stand out. First, there is a hit the other players mechanic (which can be quite vicious) built into the game. Second, at the end of each turn you take either money of victory points and there is thus a very interesting set of decisions to be made.

Feels like a blend between a modern Euro and Winsome train game. Superficially, it looks Euro - worker placement, increasing your special powers and abilities, placing special buildings. But in soul it's more like a Winsome game: a bit clunky and annoyingly mathy in play, but full of neat interactions and lively emergent valuations and opportunities. Not for non-gamers - the clunkiness of the systems and fussiness of turn ordering and requirement to do lots of bookkeeping will turn people off. Not a slick design. But for those that like lively, interactive, sharp, interestingly texture games, it's rad.

30-09-2015. Rated after 1 play. Confusing rules explanation might decrease my rating more than warranted. Yunnan is a relatively interesting worker placement game. You aim to trade tea. You do this by moving a horse meeple through provinces, allowing your traders to get further into the field.
First part of the turn, everyone places workers from their source to the board. Spaces cost money, and unless you bid high you 'lose' your meeples and don't get the action unless you pay at least relatively high. You then get an unbouncable space. The leftover meeples can travel to the province.
After the worker placement phase, everyone gets income for their meeples in provinces, Players with higher respect, may bounce workers of other players down to lower provinces. Then, the inspecter punishes the highest influence player in the furthest province that produces most money. The total money you earn, you can exchange into VPs or money.. The game ends with 80 VPs.


It's actually not bad. I am more positive now I get the game. But I should play it again, if I want to .. my first experience was very negative.
The game is relatively striaght forward.

--Aug2015-- It's quite cool: loads of butterfly effects, and a weird "it seems the rich get richer" economy that probably means we were playing badly.  I find myself intrigued - at least in the short term:  I worry a bit that play would become patterned (and possibly not exceed a local maxima, even if better play were possible) due to the limited options and lack of randomness.

Played once with 4P. Yunnan is a game of perfect information, so it is only fair to expect downtime as players work out the possible consequences of actions. There is plenty to chew on here as players juggle between setting up a chain which would resist interference and gaining enough income. In particular, I found the way the bank works and the conversion of income to VP fairly unique and interesting, despite the minor role those mechanisms play in the game.

However, the threat of kingmaking is a bummer. All players can be playing to win, yet there is the possibility that a decision to push – or even [i]not[/i] push – an opponent back in the later rounds would be a direct determinant of the eventual victor. It's quite the trolley problem, really. I suppose players could compete for influence and the Province Inspector looms as a threat, but they seem like heavy-handed attempts to mitigate an element which shouldn't have been there in the first place.

Going into this game with low expectations, I actually enjoyed this more than I thought I would. There is a solid game here, if you can look past the kingmaking issue and the feeling of constantly being knocked back over the course of 90 minutes.

Summary:  Yunnan has zero theme to it and it's a major screw your neighbor game.  It all works and the game looks nice, but I didn't really like it because of the direct confrontation.

There is pretty much nothing in Yunnan actually about tea.  Tea is never really produced or anything like that.  It could have been about anything, but really no theme is necessary.  It's totally pasted on and disconnected.  You just build a route and then the workers or tea house in each particular region "produces" an amount of tea that is then instantly converted to points or money, provided the route back to the beginning is unbroken.  It's a route building game in which you can totally dick over other players and there is nothing that they can really do except play really conservatively (and loose like I did) or take 15 minutes per turn to analyze the math (there is a ton of math in the game) and figure out the best option, then think, double think, and then triple think about what all of the other players and the game itself with do on the turn, make the move, and then probably still get screwed.  There is a large potential for king-making as well.  Don't even get me started on all of the required math per round that's part of the phase, not to mention internal math required just to make a decision on the best move to make...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.2
Rather abstract game -- don't be fooled by the neat drawings -- in which the majorities (and therefore the field that the tea inspector will visit) change very quickly, thereby making it very hard to plan ahead.

For example: Let us assume there are provinces A, B, and C, in ascending order of distance along the tea route, and players X, Y, and Z, in ascending order of influence. Currently, province C has the highest tea income. For player Z, who has traders only in province B, this is very convenient. However, in player Y's move, he moves a worker from A to C, and, having a higher influence than player X, he displaces one of X's workers back to province B. However, this means that province B now has the highest income, so the tea inspector comes to province B instead of C, and kicks player Z out, all the way back to Pu'er. That way, even a player with less influence can completely mess up the plans of an other player. Worse than that, he can often be a kingmaker by deciding which of the other players will get in trouble.

I personally think that in order to make this game playable, the tea inspector would need to be removed from the rules. But then it would just be another worker placement game.

Overall, a surprisingly good game. It didn't have a whole lot of buzz, and ended up being really cool. The game actually feels like you're building a trading network and there's a nice handicap-the-leader mechanic that keeps things from being a total runaway while still creating an opportunity for players to develop a pecking order. The auction system is solid, but it's really how you move your pieces and establish your trade route that makes this shine. It's definitely worth playing, if you get the chance.

RATING: 6
This is an auction game with some neat ideas and reasonably strategic gameplay that I feel is just a bit too shallow to really have legs.

The game takes place in two phases, the first being the auction phase.  Auctions are done on one of the progress buildings improving your abilities or resource count.  Players also have the opportunity to commit their workers to be used in the second phase or to the bank to take money and move their workers from progress buildings to the market for use in the second phase.

The auction prices are done in a neat way.  Each progress building has value 5, 7, 9, 12, and 15 spaces but taking the two cheapest spaces puts you at risk of being bumped if someone outbids you.  However if you bid at least 9, other players still have to bid more but you also get the benefit of that auction building.  The other really neat thing is how you both have to balance which workers make progress for you at these auction sites and which ones will be sent out along the tea road in the second phase (this reminds me a little bit of Dungeon Pets).  You also have the option of sending a worker to the bank for money based on the total auction prices spent by all players which also sends the rest of your workers to the market for use in the second phase.  This is so interesting because you don't have to go to the bank with your first worker.  So you can drive up auction prices then abandon the progress buildings by going to the bank later.

As interesting as the auctions are, they are a means to an end and the second phase, called the travel phase, tempers my excitement for the game a bit.  In this phase players travel along a road to sell tea to different areas.  The further away an area, the more money the locals will pay for tea.  What exactly you can do and how well you can do it are based on the auctions you've won thus far in the game and the rules associated with that are a little bit convoluted.

Despite being a little bit convoluted though in the end this is a reasonably light game and therein lies the biggest drawback in my opinion.  After you get through this whole phase each player makes a certain amount of money and then gets to choose to trade any amount of that money in at a 1:1 ratio for points.  The rest of the money is available for use in future auction phases.  While interesting I think the simplicity of it makes the game somewhat solvable.  Even without playing the game simple economic and game theory principles would dictate that you take all the money for the first several turns until you reach a certain threshold and then trade it all in for points to end the game.  This is something that has been pretty common knowledge since I first started playing Dominion and ends up making for not the deepest or most interesting game.

That said, the journey is pretty nice.  The auctions have some interesting rules and even the components strewn across the board are decent quality.  I just wish it didn't lift my spirits up so much just to let me down in the end.

Very cool concept on the bidding, reminding me something around Amun Re. The interesting choices players have on actions are also relevant enough to keep the game interesting each round. I really enjoy the keep the money or trade for VP mechanism, reminding me of Princes of Florence but very well implemented in yunnan. 
I don't like very much the idea of having to form a path of pieces to create a chain in order to get income, it annoyed me and also the inspector element, which was more than once a good reason not to have high influence.

Quite a few plays of this game have made it clear that there are multiple routes to victory, always with a careful eye on what your opponents are up to. I have always liked games with a choice of splitting points between income and VP each round, this has taken over from previous favourites for several reasons. In addition to the variety mentioned above plays surprisingly quickly, all information is right in front of you on the board - and it is a sensible size, not needing a monster table to play on. This has the added bonus of it being amazingly well priced. And if anyone does not find it thematic enough, try it while drinking fine Yunnan tea out of bone china cups - it feels right!

RATING: 7.5
Yunnan started life as a train game and was then rethemed to outer space, so it is safe to say that its release theme of trading along the ancient tea horse road does not shine through.

It is, however, mechanically interesting: somewhat difficult to explain but very clean in practice. The gist is that players are attempting to build a connected network of traders, with those traders further from the root node providing greater income. Players with higher income are penalized in turn order in the next round, affording their lower-income opponents several methods for displacing or banishing those traders, potentially crippling the earlier players' income. 

Compounding the difficulty of this heavy-handed catch-up mechanism is that players choose whether to take income as points or yuan or a combination thereof. Players must at some point pivot from yuan (for bidding) to points (for winning); a related difficulty is that traders busy leveling up in the city can't be out earning. The result is a painful set of interrelated timing games.

This is very much a preliminary rating, because initial impressions are that Yunnan is delightfully and unexpectedly opaque. There appear to be a number of viable strategies and some interesting tactics, all heavily dependent on other players. It's always a good sign when a game ends with discussion on what could have been done differently -- and there is no obvious conclusion.

So many of these eurogames play much the same from the 2nd play onwards, with most lessons learned being ones of refinement. Yunnan has proven much more surprising. I had considered that the expert game VP punishment for overbidding was intended generally as a penalty for players intended to go to the bank but were beaten to the punch, until I saw a player pursue a Wallace-esque loan strategy and bounce back from -40 to win the game. We saw one game won by a landslide with an early VP rush, only to have that same strategy utterly crushed by players alert for it in the following game.

Yunnan was barely on my radar before Spiel 2013 but it might be the only game released there that I keep.

Interesting bidding mechanic coupled with empire building and network extension. Has clear similarities to Caylus, a game I vehemently dislike, but it has a couple of things going for it:
1. Focus is more on empire building and money management, and less on moving the provost back and forth to block off actions.
2. Art is much nicer. While clearly still being an euro, it is at least pleasant to look at, compared to the head-aching dryness that is Caylus.
3. Bidding mechanic coupled with the bank mechanic makes for an interactive start of each turn. Interaction that is lacking in some other euros...

All in all, would be interested in playing this.

RATING: 4
In my opinion broken, due to the fact that a player can collects money from the bank every turn without loosing his position of first placement and last movement. In this way he will get at least 6 victory (2 meeple on stating position) without doing nothing else. He probably will be the one with less profit therefore he will keep his priority position. Sometimes he will move forward his two meeple in case worth (up to 12 points) but only if he will keep is profit lower than anyone else. The game should run within 7-10 rounds. Do I loose something?

Now here's a game that does everything right. The rules are clear and simple, the playing time doesn't outlast it's welcome, the components and graphics are great and most importantly: the game offers meaningful choices. And yet I don't love it. I like it though. I can't say what is missing here though.
There is a cool bidding mechanism, there are some nice ways to improve your abilities, there are ways to protect yourself from some bad stuff, there are a number of ways to score points... Everything is there. Except greatness. But as I said: it's a fine game that I wouldn't turn down.

I want to like Yunnan, but it feels like it ends much quicker than I'd like it to. It seems like whoever starts the VP rush by going all-in with their income can just do that with minimal set-up, retaining 9 gp to go first next round (guaranteeing a pick at whatever single auction slot they need, and going last in movement order to recover from any punishment and to control the inspector's position). Sure, you could build an engine, but it feels like that doesn't actually do anything. I've only seen one person get their horse to Tibet (no traders), and I've never seen any development in Qinghua.

All that said I might just not have played enough. Still, I think I'd like the game better if it weren't so rushy.

Excellent, well thought out game. Beautiful components and an extremely nice game board. You need to be paying close attention to what your opponents are doing and react accordingly. A lot of strategy in this game and very little luck. :) Definitely an under appreciated gem.

This seems like the sort of game where single miscalculations can hose you badly.

+ Great artwork.
+ Simple rules

- Cutthroat
- Requires multiple plays to get the strategy. New players will probably feel a bit lost.

! A strategic heavy game. Would not recommend it for new gamers.

This is the type of game you must have played atleast 10 times before you play the first time. 
Huge runaway leader problem.

I love, love, love this game.

And despite what others think, I think the two-player game works very well.

There's so much balance in the game, and you can be mean, but you'll get it back. (Probably.)

This is a straight Euro, but it's not dry. The auction and the pushing people around make it special.

Full disclosure: I received a review copy from the company.

An interesting tight game reminds me of Village.  The game itself is split up in three main areas, set auction area, tracks that benefit from the track and then finally a map area where you score your money, which then transfer into points. Its a fine small game, but very limited in replay.  You are basically fighting for a couple abilities in order to progress effectively.

Definitely better with more players. Needs multiple plays to grasp the nuance of flow and interaction.

Provisional rating, one play (at Spiel). Mostly enjoyable, but let down by the kicking mechanism and in particular the building inspector. The Influence track seems to exist to allow leading players to be reined in, and the inspector to rein in a player abusing the influence track, but in our game it seemed quite arbitrary who suffered. Also it was an issue is that the game bogged down in each movement phase, as players tried to calculate where kicking might take place.

yunnan - about selling chinese tea.
worker placement with auctions (5 diff), each auction gives diff power (more worker. more movement, building, influence etc)
start with 3 workers. once auction is over, remaning workers are used for movent.
2nd phase - move remaning workers into regions and get points. further away regions give more money. must have a continuous chian of workers/building between each area.
region with most workers gets penalty. then get money/points from each region
workers do not automatically return for next auction, can leave out in the regions to score more points

RATING: N/A
An awesome game high in player interaction where you can interfere with your opponents (potentially). Simple rules but a deep game with interesting choices each round. So many clever things in this here.

Yunnan is everything a medium-weight game ought to be in my view. There aren't that many moving parts and the first turn is nearly scripted but quickly things get interesting as players start to develop their longer-term strategies. This game has no randomness but has a lot of variability due to its high interaction and the fact that players collectively control the game length. A strategy that gives you the runaway win in one game might be an abject failure the next- it all depends on what other players are doing. The game on average only lasts 6-8 turns; with all experienced players at the table we usually knock out several 60 min sessions in one sitting. Almost everyone I've introduced this to loves it. UPDATE: I only play with 5p anymore; I think the game shines much more at that player count.

Hmmmmm, really sitting on the fence with this one. On one hand it's just a basic dry cube-pusher where you go up tracks (otherwise known as influence etc.) to make things more efficient or more protective. On the other hand the map that you send your dudes into is really quite fun and keeps the interest up.

An in your face confrontational auction/race game.  Lots of interaction and some cool mechanics make this game a welcome addition to my game closet.

RATING: 7.5
Rating based on a game of a few turns.
It appears quite complicated at the beginning but after a few turns it starts to be quite interesting. there is some interaction and where to improve your abilities is an interesting decision.
wonderful materials and nice art.
i'd like to play a complete game to give a proper rating.

[EDIT] after a complete game with 3 players, giving a rating to Yunnan is very hard. There are good mechanics, the sensations while playing are somehow good, there's something new going on. There are interaction, difficult choises, different strategies to follow. A lot of good things. But...
But the strongest sensation in the end is that there is a scarce readability of the game, it's difficult to understand what's going to happen, it's difficult to keep control of what you have. Expecially the mechanism by which you kick back you opponents, you cut their line to the base, you are kicked back to the beginning by the inspector (or whatever the gray pawn is)... you can't control them, you can't build a strategy on that.

Untile the end of the 7th out of 9 turns i was last with zero points while the other were over 50 points. I won by scoring a large amount of points in the last 2 turns: i had an idea of what i was going to do but nothing really could tell me that everything was going to be the way i inteded it to be... too much chaos.

It's a good gaming experience, on avarage, but too complicated to manage.

Respect the game. Tibetan tea dynasty control.  Too brainy and dry for my crew.

A couple of turns in, my thought was "How do we get this game to end?"  I announce my strategy to "break" the game and speed things along, and oddly enough I ended up winning, which usually helps its rating.  Not for this game though.  Played with experienced gamers and the rules were so involved that it took us an hour plus just to get through them.  Didn't seem worth that effort to me.

Solid Euro.  Might have a problem with the way the turn order changes from turn to turn in that it seems like the leader gets advantaged further.

Played only once so far. 

We played the copy i sold! It's a good game. It has auctions/bidding which is a mechanic i like and there is a lot of interaction between players on the Tea routes side of the board. Many good things to consider e.g. turn order, influence, teahouses, broken links of routes and the tax inspector. At the same time it's not overwhelming so it never lead to AP. Want to play again.

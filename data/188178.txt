I played this game with my friend who had this game. And i have to say that this board game is probably the best game i've ever played.  I have never really been into these type of games but Draconis Invasion got me hooked! and now would like to try other games as well. I will buy this game very soon and recommend it to anyone!

It is a solid deckbuilder! I don't know why 5 appering but no game fits all. 
The cards are nice, good artwork.
There are senarios in the game with diffrent setups. 
The pushback of terrorcards that limits the time.
The only thing I can think is negative is that it is not worth being quick to kill the invaders, then you get such a negative value of all events that punish you. But you always want to win.

It's ok - need to play it with higher player counts to see if that helps.

Definitely a Dominion derivative, although I much prefer this version. Seems a bit limited on deck thinning (although your VP cards don't go in the deck so that helps a bit) - terror cards should be the central element but they're a bit annoying. Definitely a race game and I think it needs multiple plays to get the depth - do you get campaigns for the specific monsters, do you build your deck or go for kills, the last option opens you up to being punished by the terror mechanic, but if you can get going quickly it might not matter.

2 player seems wrong - rules say to not play the main card that thins your deck, maybe it's to stop runaway leader (I get going quicker than you, I win), but it feels the baby has gone with the bath-water. I just ignore this rule.

Overall, very pretty, just not sure it quite shines enough to want to keep playing it.

RATING: 10
Really solid deck-building game! One of my top favourite games of all time! The artwork is phenomenal and the mechanics of the game are incredibly well thought out. It's slightly dependent on the chance of certain combinations of cards being drawn into your hand (which can work for or against you) but involves a lot of strategy for the most part. Choosing what warriors to buy, which monsters to fight, which cards to discard and which action cards to collect all add to the infinite possibilities to win the game. Take advantage of the action cards! They can really help you power your high level warriors to fight the higher level monsters. Also, if you manage your deck size well and regularly rid it of the less useful cards (like wealth) there's a good opportunity to fight something big. 

I also really enjoy the terror mechanism in the game. It generally works against the player with the most kills or benefits the others with the lesser number of kills. At some moments, it may actually be levelling out the playing field, but you never really know because the number of kills isn't always a clear indication of who's winning (it really depends on how many and who you kill). For someone who has started off slow in the game, there's still a good chance to win if you have the right strategy.

In the end, it's always a dramatic neck-in-neck race for the most points. Very exciting game! I highly recommend it :)

This game is great : I really love the gameplay, especially the "attack" mechanism, which brings great balance to the game (because you need money to use a powerful defender and therefore you have to make difficult choices during your turn). And the artwork gives this dark touch that completes the immersion. Replayability is also very good. 
Many thanks to the designer and the manufacturer!

I saw the Kickstarter and liked the art, it appealed to my liking.
I then saw the mechanics and it seemed simple enough.
Considering I only own Thunderstone Advance in this genre I decided to back this up.
It's has a similar theme in medieval fantasy but the mechanics are less stressful for non-gamers and settup time is lower.
Downtime is quite minimum and everyone is engaged in the gameplay, turns pass so fast that everyone is having fun.
With the terror dice mechanic it minimizes a run-away leader problem.

Update:
Rated down to 5 after initially 7. Reasons:
- The terror mechanic turned out to be awful. If you play good, the game will punish you to the hell. 
- There is no possibility to get rid of cards, so you can't purge your deck. Beside one action card "Transmutation". And this was an Kickstarter-exklusive, you DON't get it if you buy the game now. And it is unclear if you can trash terror cards. 
- It's a race. You have to build up your deck and have to find out THAT correct point of game to start slayering the invaders. Than you have to get useless terror cards quick to end the game fast. Otherwise an other player can fulfill campaign cards calmly and win the game.
- Defender cards are way too expensiv. You often get turns you just can't do anything useful. So the only action to do is to draw two more campaign cards. So some games ended with a whole pile of useless campaign cards. 

All in all our favorite deck builder will stay TRAINS. It is fast paced and still fun to play.

Initial comment:
Decent deck builder, awesome artwork. Kickstarter Edition, really great and thick box with plenty space to sleeve cards. And you HAVE TO sleeve them, card quality is not very good. Some cards still damaged out of the box, some slightly damaged just After two games.

Bad german translation with some mistakes. For example: (english) may and (german) have to. Lot of grammatical mistakes. Was in contact with Designer to fix this, but there was no more time to do, cause the files had to go to the printer.

Played a couple of times SOLO. Not hard to learn, but very interesting strategy trying to get a higher score than the pervious game.
I like the Battle Stage idea, where each time one plays they can change up the cards they can purchase.
The Terror Cards are a neat element, in which at first no big deal but as you grow your army so does the advancement of time, by causing more Events to happen faster. So when all events are gone it's over, 
You don't really lose in this game it's all about points.

When faced with the prospect of a new deckbuilding game, I was thrilled by the idea. I've always enjoyed deckbuilders, and this one was promised to me as a brand new Kickstarter game with beautiful art and a fun new Terror mechanic.

Well, half of that was true.

Draconis Invasion is undeniably a pretty game. The art is meticulous and gorgeous and covers the entirety of each card, adding a certain flavor to the game that offers a certain level of immersion. If you're seeking a game that will draw bystanders to ask, "What's that?" then this is the game to buy. Just so long as you don't, y'know, play it.

Gameplay starts off fairly bog standard; you have a deck of 12 cards, with 7 Wealth (low-level money) and five Guards (low-level fighters), play all of your cards every turn and draw back up at the end of your turn, yadda yadda. There's an interesting combat mechanic where you can fight either high-level or low-level monsters. 

The game also loves its Terror cards, which are cards that it forcibly crams into your deck at practically every turn. These cards have only one purpose: when discarded, they increase the Terror level of the game, which operates on a scale of 1-6. When the Terror level hits 6, reset it to 1 and an Event occurs. When the deck runs out of events (or if someone beats six monsters, which I can scarcely imagine), the game ends and whoever has the most victory points is the winner.

I have a hard time believing that anyone actually play-tested this game. You see, Terror cards can't be played; they must be discarded (to ill effect, advancing the Terror track). When monsters show up, you gain Terror cards. When events occur, you gain Terror cards. When the first player's turn comes around, you see what the current Terror level is, and - you guessed it - you gain Terror cards. We actually completely depleted the Terror deck about halfway into our game, and it's hard to imagine not doing so.

Low-level monsters are - with few exceptions - too difficult for anyone to defeat with the low-level Guards with whom you start. Reapers and Hellhounds (25 and 30 HP respectively) represent either perfect draws or - in the case of the Hellhounds - an impossible goal. You MUST purchase fighters who will battle for you, and here's another point where the game sags: fighters must be paid with gold from your hand, or they sit there and do nothing. Didn't get lucky enough to draw 50 gold AND your decent fighter? Tough luck. No fighting for you.

Another key issue I have with this game is that it robs the player of a sense of agency. As the Terror track check occurred again and again and my deck was increasingly packed full of Terror cards (and money I hadn't earned), I began to realize that a large portion of my deck was made of cards I hadn't purchased, selected, or desired. My skill didn't matter; it was up to random chance, even moreso than a card game should be, and my decisions had a relatively small impact on the overall face of my resources.

I'm not one to simply sit back and say 'it stinks!', mind you. Thus, I present:
HOW I WOULD FIX IT:
* -10 GOLD COST ON ALL ACTION CARDS. The game has a distinct threshhold below which your combat options are grievously underpowered. I sat with no more than 60 gold in my hand for the entire game with competent fighters starting at 70, feeling utterly paralyzed and getting worse as more and more Terror cards were shuffled into my deck.
* REDUCE MONSTER VICTORY POINTS. On the second-to-last turn of our game, the first player - who had miraculously gotten together enough money to buy one Dragon Slayer card - played it and defeated a Dragon. Those 7 victory points completely trivialized everything that every other player had done; I added together all victory points gained by all other players, and the Dragon was worth more. I literally said "that's game" and started disassembling my deck.
* STOP PUNISHING PLAYERS FOR BEING AHEAD. This isn't Mario Kart; literally every Event (and there need to be a lot more kinds) punished the player who had defeated the most monsters, and they came hard and fast thanks to the way the game is designed. This goes a long way toward discouraging players from defeating monsters, further reinforcing the notion that depleting the Event stack is the way the game is intended to end.
* REWORK TERROR MECHANIC. The way that the Terror mechanic currently works makes the game an unplayable mess. If Terror cards are to be added to the player's deck, there needs to be a way to remove them. Unlike other games, cards that are "trashed' are simply returned to their stack to be regained, so there's no reason not to do this. Even something as simple as an action that trashes two cards in a player's hand (one of which may be a Terror card) would make an enormous difference. As it is, the game races headlong for the "run out of events" endgame condition with such zeal that I can't imagine any player successfully defeating six monsters.

Our group has agreed not to play this game again, and that's a decision of which I hope to remind them if the prospect ever comes up in the future. As far as deck-builders go, I consider this to be a drastically inferior example, not suitable for gamers of any stripe unless you happen to be a masochist.

One player suggested only buying it if you want to frame and display the cards. I love the art...but it's not $60 good.

RATING: 1
Abject garbage. If you enjoyed playing this as per the actual rules, stay far, FAR away from my gaming groups, please. First game that I have ever played where the fundamental mechanics were completely broken. Everything awful with this promising concept is centered around those terror cards. Swore the designer (a man of inflated self-importance) said there would be effective ways to manage terror early in the KS campaign. Level-up system to the rescue? Lies. Winner is almost guaranteed to be whomever pulls the miracle draw necessary to kill a dragon near the end of the game. Good luck having a chance to use some cards more than once. I could write a novel, but I absolutely refuse to believe that this was critically tested by people that are fans of quality DBGs like Dominion, Ascension or Legendary: Alien (or the like).

The concept has innovative flashes and DI could be a decent game if the rules were re-written, but no way I am wasting my time trying to resuscitate it. Nice idea, good art...with execution that literally *offends me*.

I backed Draconis Invasion on KS a while ago but I still haven’t played it. I bought all the extra promos for the game but one was missing and when I contacted the designer he told me that they didn’t had any more so I don´t have it and he offered a refund. To me that’s very sad as I´m a completionist and it also bothers me.

Due to this situation, my desire to play the game is low. We will see if I play it or I sell it, but I won’t be backing it again for the expansion.

The mechanism that your warriors need pay to fight for you is nice.  I think if the designer adds variation to the soldiers and bad guys, the game will get better.

You will always want to improve on your last game. Easy to teach and learn is a huge plus.

Nice graphics but the gameplay is so incredibly dull... You get punished for doing well with terror all the time which makes thinning your deck pretty pointless too as your average card quality doesn't rise much (removing chaff also increases the proportion of terror cards). Also you have 2 currencies but you need money to pay your fighters so you always need to improve your money leaving no options. Absolutely awful design.

The only good thing about this game is the art. I dislike deckbuilders but this one might be the worst one ive ever played. 

Paying to get a card and then paying to use a card DOES NOT WORKbuy a card for 40 and you need 70 to use it everytime ? dumb. Also the money is brutal in this game its waaaaay to slow.  It takes 10 turns get get enough money to buy anything. Which is also stupid because someone can kill 6 garbage enemies and end the game. There is no incentive to buying the more expensive cards. 

The worst mechanic in the game is the campaigns which basically means if you cant do anything with your hand take 2 cards that might help u score more point . In a 2 player game we depleted that deck near the end of the game which tells you how many garbage turns we had .  How is doing nothing on you turn 1/3rd of the time fun ?

This game seemed like a confused implementation of a deck builder. It has the classic deck building elements, secret objects, combat, special events that never triggered in the game I played. The pacing was weird in that there was a rush to fight low point invaders at the beginning, then a huge lull where we tried to build up our decks enough to be able to fight the remaining high point invaders, which were needed in order to trigger end game. 

The cards are of nice quality, and the art is nice if you like that style.

Art? Beautiful. Great art, and appreciate the art book that came with the Kickstarter version.

Quality? Fine. Some cards were bent when I opened the box, but everything seems durable.

Mechanics? Fun! It is a well-built deck builder, with a cool campaign mechanic (think to Ticket to Ride ticket cards). Competitive play, with a solo variant. I have not tried the solo variant, so I will not comment on it.

Theme? You play warriors trying to earn glory for your kingdom. Very cool theme, strengthened by the fantastic art, BUT (and its a big but for me) the theme of it just seems to have no bearing on the game's mechanics. For instance, the terror die will cause event cards to be played, but the event cards are basically just an attempt to help the current losing player catch up. With a "terror" mechanic, I expect it to be something different - like maybe something that all players have to overcome, or else all players suffer a negative effect. I just feel like the Terror mechanic was really pushed as a unique part of the game and it did not really have much impact on us when playing.

Summary? Art is beautiful, and solid mechanics. I would just rather play Dominion for a multi-player game, or play Ascension for a 2-player game. This game just did not have enough stand-out elements for me to replay often or invest in expansions.

Another take on the Dominion style deck builder. Along with building your deck you fight monsters in order to win victory points.
The game plays swiftly and I enjoy the monster part of it.

a refreshing take on deckbuilding! Tons of variables for setups and a great balance of managing terror in a deck, which acts as both a timer for the game and drags deck efficiency. Having had a taste of the upcoming expansion, player interaction will be high making this one of the most sophisticated deckbuilders I've played!

A very enjoyable deck builder with a terrific tension that builds throughout the game. The solo play is balanced and one of my favorites.

Game is a ton of fun with great replayablity. From the pre made scenarios to randomly drawing your own, the strategy changes every game.  With the create your own cards from the kickstarter, the game has even more depth.

For some reason the name of this game makes me think of The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss.  They should make a Kvothe card.

Me and my g/f absolutely love this game....Yes...Terror cards do get added almost every turn after the first 2 rounds...and yes...the terror deck gets depleted after about round 10....Yes...some of the cards are way overpriced...but it really makes you think out a strategy on what and when to buy......We just like using the randomizers for every game...I will totally support any expansions for this as I hope there are some.

This one simply flew under the radar, maybe because it resembles Dominion quite a lot, but it's actually a very good game. I introduced it to my group and they grinned when I explained it was a KS, but they keep asking to play it now...

I love the predefined (optional) card groupings.

What it needs is more invaders and maybe less emphasis on Bonus cards, which are just points for beating specific invaders.

Just from reading the rules, it really seems like a basic deck builder with a few interesting ideas. I think it'll be more the theme then the unique game play that would interest someone. I consider the two big deck builders as Thunderstone and Dominion, just based off the expansions and the volume of variety- Not sure where this one fits although I like the looks and even if it doesn't have enough to say it's original, I like deck builders and the subject matter. Starting with a 5 based on my understanding of the game play, I'll adjust as needed through game play

A fun deckbuilder, where the addition of hidden Agendas really adds some tension. You just don't know if your points will suffice to win, and the strategy to just go for some quick kills might pay off, if you have enough luck to pull it off before others get some agendas done...

The artworks (to me, an important part of the games I play) are superb and varied, and though the gameplay itself is straightforward, there's a lot of speculating and planning (if inclined to do so), which cards to buy and how to proceed in terms of bolstering the deck or killing invaders. The complexity in this manner is, to my taste, just right - it can be played easy and loose, or with lots of planning and concentration. The first is what I strive for after a long day at work, the latter when the other players get really competitive.

As a long term Dominion fan I was looking forward to this. It does not disappoint. It is not just a Dominion clone and plays very differently with high replayability even with the same action and defender cards out. Really looking forward to new invaders in the expansion

Great art and an enjoyable deck builder game. But it is almost identical to Thunderstone and not better. Some usability design flaws hamper the gameflow a bit and it felt like it wasn't really developed and playtested rigorously enough to be finished but instead just delivered as fast as possible in whatever shape it was, as is usual for KS projects. Also where are all the dragons.

Uninspired take-that "deckbuilder". 
Events are samey and feel like a poorly executed catch-up mechanic. 
Do not kill any monster after you really build your deck, then race for it and hope
you don't get smacked too much by the events and/or terror cards.
Never again.

Incredible art and very enjoyable game play. Anyone I've introduced to the game has been super impressed with the game mechanics. 

As someone that has been involved in playtesting for both Draconis and the designers new game Galactic Coliseum I can tell you that both games have been tested and tweaked for long periods of times until mechanics were clean, strategic and enjoyable. 

Regarding a couple of negative reviews below I can only think that it comes from a misunderstanding of how the terror cards work. If so, that's unfortunate as the game is actually very well balanced. Terror cards are an auto balancer. It punishes certain game play. But I've won draconis with a mitt full of terror cards. There's many ways to play. Every game that I've played has been different. 

It's a great game.

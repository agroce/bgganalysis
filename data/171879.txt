This is not a particularly deep game and despite an attempt to put an interesting theme on it, it is pretty bland but it does offer some tricky decisions in a relatively short timespan and can largely be played without too much deep thought so I may eek a few more plays out of it yet.

A stabby game in the end - it is interesting in how you collect powers to build your automobiles for sale. The stabby part is cutting out opponents from the sale - but making a better car (which can be predicted a bit) to simply undercutting their price - which is plain old mean. But it well crafted in a system of card abilities and choices. Quite good!

Lots of nice elements here; the time consumed turn order thing re-cycled from Cramer's earlier Glen More; the scramble to choose buyers who want the kind of car you're producing; then getting your car to market, pitched at a price it will sell at; the race track sub-game.  The problem is that only  one stream of development - engines - can score from both sales and racing.  It can be countered if the other players know the game and work together, but with so many better balanced games on the market, why am I going to make that effort with Kraftwagen? 

The artwork is muted but functional.  Production quality is good.

I picked this up because I enjoyed Rococo and Lancaster from the same designer. I am glad I did. It might become my favorite of the three! Tense, difficult, interesting decisions every turn. The market and the action selection rondel are fantastic. You really need to watch the other players. 

I appreciate the unique theme and the understated, clean graphic design. Excellent components. Keeper.

Kraftwagen is a clever game of timing and push your luck battles, built around an interesting "chain of actions" mechanism, clearly modeled after the one used in Glen More.  This distinctive "chain of actions" mechanism works surprisingly well in Kraftwagen. 

As for the game itself, it is my sense that on a first play, a fair number of players are going to find the game disappointing, particularly those who did not upgrade their engines in their Grand Prix car throughout the game, or felt that other players had far better card draws, something that can feel grating.  

The relatively bland art in the game can also feed this disappointment:  I failed to upgrade the engine on my Grand Prix, and I am going to lose this game after another hour of sitting here, and all I have to stare at is this bland art!

All that being said, assuming all players pay attention to engines and their Grand Prix racer, the game would seem to have more than enough ways to self-balance any card draw issues.  In particular, manipulating the customer types by rushing the action chain, rushing the end of the round, and yes, jointly targeting the possible runaway leader on all fronts, all suggest themselves.

Clearly, this is a game with a quirky ability to manipulate the game state as it applies to all the other players.  Selecting customers and customer orders really ripples through all the other players subsequent actions.  Placing a certain type of car in the show room can also really ripple through all other players plans.  Kraftwagen's ability to generate such interesting ripples (at least for euro gamers) makes it a very distinctive and interesting euro gaming experience.  

Bottom line:  I find it hard to really dislike Kraftwagen, though also, perhaps hard to fully love it as well.  Guess I need to play it some more.  I suspect that once one learns to appreciate all the levers so to speak, Kraftwagen gets quite interactive in its own unique way.

Kraftwagen is a medium weight euro with a prominent rondel-mechanism. With this mechanism, the player furthest back goes first and can move forward to any available action. Thus, they can move far ahead and take a very desirable action. But if they do so, they risk allowing others to take multiple actions. Thus, the whole rondel-mechanism forces players to value actions carefully. 

By utilizing these actions, players are often attempting to sell cars (There are other ways to score VP, but selling cars is the most important). But to sell cars, players need to use actions to bring specific buyer to the market. But you also need the attributes that those buyers want, which mean you need actions that allow you to research and build/acquire those attributes. Thus, a wonderful race-element emerges as players bring specific buyers to the market and attempt to capitalize on them before other players can.

I am oversimplifying the gameplay quite a bit... but this is not a difficult game to teach (Medium-weight). It plays very fluid and is likely to be enjoyed by most euro gamers. That being said, there is one large concern I have about the game. The research action seems significantly luck dependent as certain cards are much better than others. Now, normally this wouldn't be a huge issue because players should be able to recognize those cards and make a decision about jumping ahead. But when the cards are poor, you often don't want to take one, as it may create an opportunity for another player. But you can't simply skip the action (the other player would take it and then act again). Thus, it seems like the randomization of the research-deck may be more influential than desired. 

Still, I find it pleasant to play.

I'll admit to a single play and that I went into the game knowing nothing about it. What I found, was a delightfully elegant game that got easier as the game progressed. The main engine is the action track, where you choose what action you want to take, but in doing so, you may not get another turn for a few turns if you move too far ahead, as the last player on the track is the current player.

Excellent game, fantastic production, and in my opinion, simple but effective and elegant art.  Adapting the turn order system of Glen More, Cramer develops a really good game about car development, races and sales.  There is a lot of interaction, not only to take the actions, but in the sales, and in the race.  Really enjoyable, it plays in about one hour and you are constantly taking hard decisions.

I've played it twice so far. With 4 players, 2 were able to monopolize the tech, and the others got left behind and could not catch up. With 2, both were able to excel at all of the tech. The winner was the one that was best able to steal the other players buyers. Good game, plays fast, and there are some hard choices. Not sure how much replay I'll get out if it, but I've enjoyed it so far.

RATING: 6.5
First Play: Heard good things from like minded gamers and so I was expecting great things. The rule book is succinct and relatively clear despite some stuttered English and what I think is an error in the example on page 8. Artwork is subdued and well produced.

The game hangs together well. The action track is a mechanism taken from Glen More and the research advancements logically connect the develop and build aspects of the game.

I have only one reservation but it is severe. The research cards are what I would call, 'Fall in your lap, or give you a slap'. You need these cards to allow you to develop the bodywork of the cars and the engines. On top of that they give you engineers and other lesser benefits.  Some of these cards offer you a single advancement in engine or bodywork, others offer you an advancement AND an engine or body to build, others offer you two pieces of advancement, either two engines/ body or one of each. These double advancements are extremely useful and obviously twice as good as the single version. I guess that it was appreciated that the risk of a poor card on offer needed to be reduced so two cards are offered at one time. However at the end of my game I had no double research cards whilst other players had 5-6 double cards. This wasn't because I ignored or avoided them, it was because they were never on offer when I had the opportunity to select one when I could take research.

I know people will say that this sort of bad luck rubs out over multiple plays, but my beef is that the game allows this to happen at all. All cards need to be of an equal-ish value or the winner will invariably be chosen owing to the cards drawn. The final scores were only 4 points apart from 1st to 3rd with me scoring nearly half of the others total.

I sold Tigris and Euphrates once I realised that the tile draw could ensure that you lost regardless of how you played and I'm afraid this falls into that category. I don't think I'll play this again. Sold.

Fun game but very swingy, the game plays out like a auction game where the player who has the last bid can dictate the market. Players need to know what they are doing in this game and the game requires experience players to be balanced. I would like to rate the game higher but, i dont know how much replay value the game has, need to play it more. But after one very swingy first play i would give the game a second chance if I get the chance. I like gleen more more since it has more variety.

Layers upon layers upon layers upon layers of decisions and strategies.   Masterfully designed.   

I don't normally like my games to look like spreadsheets, and this had a bit of that...  but, just so many different strategies to pursue, and interaction with other players, and..   

Better still, I hated Glen More with a passion.  I liked certain things about it, but I thought it was a horrible, unpleasant experience I would rather never play again.  I would even pay a small sum of money to never play it.   Hated it.  Phased tiling.  A personal board that you needed to have a short class in managing.  

BUT, I liked the turn mechanism where you could jump forward, but it would cost you.  

Here, with not really having phased tiling, with having a straightfoward personal board, with having some very straightforward cards (no super special abilities, everything boiled down to some very simple symbols)...   it was nice to revisit with a game that I actually could understand and enjoy without having played once.

I rate this a 9, but the only people I would play this with are people who already own it.

This is a really well designed game, and I do plan to play it more, but I don't think it has enough staying power since the only thing that will change from game to game is the randomness of the cards & Action tokens.  I really felt like if the game had a variety of achievements, it would have been much more interesting.  I really enjoyed the graphic design & theme, and while the game is a euro, the theme did come through I thought.

Very cool game.  I love the action selection mechanic (like in Glen More).  It's key you are able to work the actions and adjust strategy when need be.  We played two games in a row and played with the expansion which adds an extra action that changes every time it's used.  It added a ton without being obtrusive.  It is a must to use it in this game.

// This is another game I picked up mostly based on theme,
which I guess is saying something for a Euro game. It
plays quite smoothly and has interesting choices to make
with the roundel/player order mechanism. The drawback is
that--similarly to Glen More--once you start to fall 
behind, it can be very difficult if not impossible to have
a shot at winning.

2015, 2-4p, 60-75 min. Sounds under-whelming and sounds like there are lots of things to dislike.  It's an economic game built around a rondel of actions that moves (like in Shipyard) and a "time track" mechanism (like Glen More, Thebes & Around the World in 80 Days) where the player in the back moves first and might get multiple moves in succession, depending on how far other players have chosen to jumped ahead on the rondel.  It sounds like an okay game that is marred by the luck/randomness of the research card mechanism (only 2 cards are available, and they are drivers for gameplay).  Another big complaint seems to be the fact that most of the bonuses are claimed in round 1 of 3, resulting in a dead space/action on the board/rondel. Others say: the car sale market is vicious (don't go there first or you're likely to get undercut by everyone and get zero points for the round), it's best to heavily specialize in one thing, possible runaway leader issues if someone gets too far ahead in one type of technology, not enough variation/spice (just engines and car body styles), basic and boring "points salad" game without much that is new/interesting aside from the seldom-used Glen More rondel + time-track turn order thing.

Really great game. Adding the Glen More-style time track to a more substantial board game is a great touch. Turns are quick but decisions are tough, as you balance racing on the Grand Prix, techs for upgrades, getting cars/buyers on the market, and keeping your workers stocked. 

My only small issue with the game is that some of the tech cards are so obviously better than others that a couple of lucky draws can really benefit one player more than others. I wish there was a way to wipe the development cards, or at least decline them if a player isn't interested.

From the designer of Glen More, this is driven by a similar 'chose how far you want to move' Rondel, but is a liitle more complex game as you need to develop your engine and chassis technologies yo builf and sell cars as well as race them in Grand Prix's, all of which has tricky timing issues and variable victory points available. Felt maybe a wee bit crowded with 4 - 3 might be better.

RATING: 5
A well-designed game, but I found it a bit boring, even though I can't quite put my finger on exactly why.  While it had a bunch of ways to score points, none of them seemed all that exciting or innovative.

I think I'm just finding that a standard Euro point salad game hasn't been impressing me much if they don't do anything exciting or new, and this fits that vein. The neatest part is the action mechanism which also appears in  Glen More and a couple other games. The rest is very vanilla stuff like get a card that improves your ability to do something, or take an engine, or take a car chassis. It just felt a bit slow, plodding, and boring.

Overall, I do think a lot of people will like this as it's a well designed point-salad type game, and I'd certainly play again if others wanted to. I just wasn't that excited by it. For a game with the same "hook", which is the action selection mechanism, Glen More is the go-to game.

It's not a bad game. I was pretty excited after hearing the rules. I like the idea of the action selection mechanism. I enjoyed the market and the way the buyers worked, and even the railroad tycoon like bonuses for completing tasks first. 

I had some major problems with the game though. Because the market asks for best in a certain class and because of the first to finish bonuses, the game requires specialization. But the only way to specialize is through research. And the cards available to you on your opportunity to research often don't cooperate with your plans. On top of that, for unknown reasons, some research cards give you double the upgrade of others. It is very easy to get stuck. 

Engines are very powerful due to their additional use in the grand prix. It is easy to say that other players then simply need to compete for engines, but the game restricts your ability to do that. You have to get lucky with the research.

You end up feeling like you are somewhat playing chicken with your opponents. "Will they skip to that action or not? Can I wait to grab it this time?" You then get to balance building & selling cars vs running the race team. Lots of interesting choices to keep you on your toes.

Great components and design, really good action selection mechanism and interesting purchasing and game length influence mechanisms. Where the game falls short is in the inexplicable decision to make the research tiles almost as random a factor as it could be. I cannot believe the developers did not consider a rolling card mechanism like Through the Ages or similar to diminish the luck of the draw. As it stands out of the box, the research rules almost make the game among equal players a random affair, and that's inexcusable. A good game turned luckfest. Avoid.

Huh. Not sure what to think about this one after one play. Seems to have way more luck than I would have expected from reading the rules. Getting decent research cards when you are in a reasonable position to take that action is critical. It seems a bit weird that all players are upgrading their car bodies and engines, but it really only matters who has the best in each. Also seems weird that there are only 4 buyers for 6 cars. Players just get massively screwed. And given that there are more cars than buyers, someone will always take the cheapest price. Seems kinda fragile.

Initial time playing this game was a little difficult. It's made up of three rounds. You are building cars; body and engine. Once you have a body & engine then you can sell it. In the meantime you can upgrade your car. You can also take your grand prix car to the races. In addition, you can complete community objectives (be the first to accomplish certain things). The difficulty at fiest was understanding what action you were taking. Whether it was upgrading the car or building the car. It took about two rounds to get the sense of it. By the third round I was able to see the strategy and game flow. Real nice game. Easy now. The technology cards are a little difficult to read at first also. Often checking the rules to understand them.

I'm enjoying the first few plays of this. I really like the action turn order mechanism also found in the designer's Glen More, and better yet, there's no punishment for hanging back and taking too many tiles (as it were with Glen More).

It's not the world's most complex game -- and it's pretty easy to explain the rules -- but there's still a good amount of depth and multiple choices and strategies to win the game. Great learning tool to get people a little further into gaming.

A lot of people complain about the luck in this game, particularly with the card draw, but I'm okay with it ... there's usually always something else you can do and I think it adds variety to the game, forcing you to take different strategies (not always the same ones you like. It's easy to put your head down, ignore the other players and curse the game for some of its random elements, but that would be a mistake. Pay attention and adjust quickly on the fly.

Visually the game is great and it's a nice length for game night.

This one has a lot of promise, but ultimately suffers from a runaway leader problem.  Tech is way too important early on.  If you get shut out of chassis or engine upgrades (especially the doubles), you are in a world of hurt.  The luck and timing of the draw can flat out win the game for you or send you to the bottom rung.  The race track is mostly a red herring.  Would I play again?  Sure, but I would insist on letting all players know how important some techs are...and just hope that the cards don't fall to one player in a way that gives him a big majority lead in engines/chassis.

I was so looking forward to this game. Matthias Cramer has been on such form recently (Glen More, Lancaster, Rococo) after all. Kraftwagon uses the rondel-like tile selction from Glen More but replaces it with action selection. And when you start playing the game it seems a real winner. There are cards to get, cars to sell, salesmen to employ and racing cars to race. It feels good. But after a while the game's limitations become exposed. There are particular routes you can follow but you have to be the best in any one strategy or you will get nothing. And then if the cards don't come up which support your chosen strategy you will be hampered. So, the limitations of restricted cards along with a need to really specialise can lead to frustrations. On top of that one particular path, engines, is extra powerful as it means you excel in the Racing part of the game and in one of the Sales areas.  Sure you can go for a price and worker strategy and ignore car bodies and engines, but the limitations on the cards on offer is an issue, and once someone gets ahead on engines or car bodies you can't afford to try and catch them.

So disappointed.  I sold on after one play.

Ok, 2 plays and I'm itching to play this again.  

How can such a simple mechanism (the Glen More action mechanism) provide such agonising strategic depth?
Do I play short and get the extra actions or lose a turn or two and get the action(s) I really need to do. 

Timing is everything as there is little point spending all your actions researching the best engines and bodies if you are unable to get a car into the market.  Even if you can get it to market, someone may have tilted the buyers in favour of cheap car or prestige, thereby rendering your Magnus opus worthless.

My wife does not like the drab colours used and the style of the artwork.  I think it makes the game easier to play as everything is crystal clear.  I hope I can persuade her to play again.

Der Aktionsmechanismus aus GLENN MORE, hier in rudimentärer, originärer Form. Drumherum ein funktionales, mechanisches Spielbrett mit monochromem Blaustich. Harald Lieske, der Preußen Münsteraner, ein KSC-Fan? Und dennoch hat KRAFTWAGEN Herz und Liebe, was vielleicht daran liegt, dass Matze Cramer ein geliebtes, angedachtes Frühwerk nun spät ans Tageslicht bringt. Unter der Motorhaube geht es darum, PKWs aus der Steinzeit der Automobilentwicklung auf einen Markt zu bringen und sie dort an bestimmte Käufertypen mit unterschiedlichen Vorlieben zu verschachern. Der Clou: Die Spieler bestimmen die Käufer selbst, was zu einem sehr interaktiven und blutgrätschendem Momentum führen kann, da man immer damit rechnen muss, dass das eigene Auto vom Käufer verschmäht im Markt zurückbleibt. Man kann KRAFTWAGEN durchaus hässlich, aber auch ganz familiär und friedliebend spielen. Dazu noch naive Grand Prix Rennen sowie alle Persönlichkeiten aus der Automobilbranche, die das Werk historisch anhauchen. Ein flüssig komponierter Ausflug ins verstaubte Automobilmuseum für Jungs mit öligen Fingern, die früher ihr Mofa frisiert haben,​ mit mittlerem Anspruch, aber gehobenem Charme. Funktionalität mit Herz, hier ist der Beweis. 7/10 für das Spieldesign, 8/10 für die Soulfulness.​

This game is a lot of fun.  The rondel mechanism works to perfection here, the rules are very simple, and there is little downtime.  Our first game, which had three players, took about an hour to play.  The Grand Prix strategy is clearly very powerful.  It will be interesting to see if a runaway leader happens again in future games.

Now that I'm up to 7 plays of Kraftwagen, I'm convinced it's a 10.  I love how different parts of the game come together, and despite the complaints about unlucky card draws, I can't see myself ever not enjoying it.

No spatial puzzle like Glen More but the rondel of actions decisions are better in this one than the aforementioned.  The Gran Prix/Technology/Sales are separate races unto themselves and are gratifying and tense to take part in.  Great pacing and quick playtime!

Fun tight game (especially after we realized that many techs REQUIRE workers to staff them, not GIVE us workers).  Love the action roundel.  And the mechanic for putting together a car to sell and introducing buyers into the market really works WELL!

Opinion: take it with care, if you look for something deep, forget it. It is a light game with some interaction related to the actions. The action selection, like in Glen More, is really good (if you want the more lucrative actions, probably you will have to wait several turns to go again). Could seem that the Grand Prix is something to go for it, but take it with care. Also you could see that having the best motor is powerful, but you can win making poor cars but taking your opportunity when it comes. The technology cars do not seem to be an issue, as I have read they are unbalanced, well, this is part of the game. If good technologies appear, you have to fight for them, if they do not, you can take them when you have a good chance.
In the end, it is a good game, coming better as you play more

3 Plays in now, and this is now my current favourite new game.

My initial doubts about the power of the engineers has been eradicated and I now view them as a clever piece of the overall game, (although I still have my doubts about one of the engineers being over powered and another being a "good gamble" to take) - but no names, no pack drill).

Every play so far as revealed more depth to the game.

Sadly, in my games group, I am the only fan. But I will continue to spread the word.

Have the V6 expansion but not sure it adds and may detract from the game. Time will tell....

Initial Rating: 7.0 (February 2017)

Matthias Cramer is a designer that I respect a lot. I love Helvetia and I really like Lancaster and Glen more, so my desire to play Kraftwagen was very high!

I imported the game from Germany on 2015 and it was very expensive, and worse of all for me, it came without the V6 mini expansion, I had to buy it separately, again from Germany. For this reason I prefer the Stronghold edition of the game, and it is much cheaper as well.

Kraftwagen´s rules are very easy to grasp and teach. You can teach it under 15 minutes. Play time is around 1 hour, which is very fast for this kind of game.

The game´s component are well done and they serve their purpose well. They are thick cardboard. The art is ok. 

The theme isn’t among my favorites but it works!

Kraftwagen reuses the main mechanism found in Glen More, that is, the turn order is decided by who is going last and that player can get any action he desires, but if he jumps ahead by a lot, other players will play many turns before he plays again. It is a tense balancing mechanism deciding how many spots to jump, it is brilliant. 

The game´s decisions are not obvious, in fact I’m amazed that it has a lot of deepness for a game that plays this fast. In particular, deciding how much to price your car is a tense and fun decision! 

There is a lot of uncontrollable luck with the engineering cards and I’m still undecided how I feel about them. On one hand you see two cards at any moment, but some cards are clearly much more powerful than others, so it is pure luck if you get what you need when it is your turn. I would have preferred this to be less random, besides, it feels un-thematic for the players not having access to the same level of development. In Rococo, the random cards destroyed the game for me, I hope this is not the case here.  

Bottom line, I enjoyed my play of Kraftwagen. I wish there was a way to control the luck of the draw but as it plays so fast I don’t mind much. It is a solid 7.0 for me and probably a keeper in my game collection but I need more plays to decide. I also like that the new edition of the game comes with a variant that I want to try soon.

RATING: 7
Players run small start-up companies in the early days of the European auto market. Essentially players develop technologies in order to sell cars to buyers who each value a certain feature. Players not only put out the cars to sell, they also select the buyers' preferences, so what cars you want to sell at what price is determined as you go. The game is about being able to influence what will sell and then produce better versions of it than the others. There are four preferences buyers are potentially after: body, engine, prestige and price. Every car put to market will have a value in each of these categories and ties will go to the cheaper seller. This creates an evolving market for players to read and try to out-position each other. Not all cars will sell and you get your sales price in points. This part of the game works very well.

One-third of the game, however, is unrelated to car sales and involves racing around a track - ostensibly putting out race cars to promote your company. If you decide to compete here it can eat up a ton of actions, but will net you comparatively little compared to selling cars. The difference between finishing first and second is only 3 points - hardly worth fighting for, especially when you can get up to 15 points on a good car sale. In the two games I played, putting a strong focus on racing, especially in the late game, netted much less than those who focused on selling exclusively. If this continues to be an issue, I'll likely knock the game down a point. It looks like a curious design imbalance in an otherwise excellent title.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game is a good artefact, maybe the buyers are too determinant and can ruin your game, but with an identical atmosphere Wallace's Automobile is much better. The race section is a clever and fun addition. --- After a second game, I think again that there is not worth investing in car body, to the extent that the activation of buyers who prefer service or price is extremely easy. Investing in engine at least can suppose a good race car. I comfortably won the game with a level-1 body car and a level-2 engine and a quick close of the game, while the other players were spending time and efforts in R+D. Downrated to 6.

Rating based on about a half-dozen plays.  Very solid game, I like the mechanism that the designer introduced in Glen More and think this game is better because of the merge of theme and mechanics plus the multiple paths to victory (concentrate on the racing, the bonus chips, or the actual selling of cars).  I foresee there being a need for expansions in the future just to increase the replayability but this is a solid, quick playing Euro that would be an excellent addition to anyone's game collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This game offers several scoring options while building or racing cars over three rounds. Tiles are selected that give various actions. Research gives cards that offer improvements such as being able to build better engines or better car bodies. Racing gives points based on finish order at the end of the round. Building cars offers points based on winning the goal of one of four buyers. These are for best body, best engine, cheapest, or most crew. Other tiles offer bonuses for being the first to complete certain actions. The game offers plenty of interesting selections and conveys the feel of being part of the car industry in Germany during the early years.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good but not as good as Glen More. The rondel mechanism lacks a penalty mechanism for the last player to simply pick up everything between him and the next-to-last player. While Kraftwagen feels larger compared to Glen More, I would say that the latter has more depth. I also prefer the spatial landscape building to the engine building of Kraftwagen that leaves you with the prerogative to develop motors while being ahead of the pack in one area (motors, bodywork, grand prix, engineers). The buyer/market mechanism is the best part. As a Rüsselsheimer I had to get Adam Opel and do it with price.

Very fun game.  Only reason it is not a ten for us is that we have played it out.  So it is currently shelved until we forget our strategies.  I think it could benefit from an expansion.  But it has also been a great medium weight game for some of our friends that are 'leveling up' from intro worker placement.

Matthias Cramer reutilizes the turn order system he used in Glen More. Kraftwagen looks like it could be a heavier euro game, but it ends up being a quick playing medium weight one. You get a nice package of simplified car building, technological leaps, selling the cars and some racing with multiple different strategic options to choose from. Also reminds me a bit of Princes of the Renaissance for the way each round is forced to end.

2016-10-15 - 7 - Good euro about building cars, but not as good as Automania IMO. I'm not a fan of a race in this game - it seems very artificial, but can bring a lot of points. The action track gives interesting choices and the market is pretty clever. In our first game we weren't experienced in how the market works, which resulted in a big disparity of scores. I think they will even in the next games, what might lead to a higher rating of the game. We'll see.

Seems like a solid game that falls in between the light and medium game scale. The action track is interesting in how it moves around and changes according to what is chosen and turn order works a la Glen More where whomever is last keeps going until he isn't last. It didn't wow me and I'd rather play Glen More, but I'd play again.

The game centres around an action rondel similar to [b][thing=66589][/thing][/b] or [b][thing=24181][/thing][/b], but this rondel mutates as actions are selected.  Turn order is determined similar to games like [b][thing=66362][/thing][/b] and [b][thing=123540][/thing][/b] where the last player goes first and can go first multiple times if other players jump too far ahead on the rondel.  As the game is about selling cars, one of the central actions is activating customers.  And customers are key to one's success since each customer (and there are only four) determine which cars in the market are sold.  A player could have the best designed car (body and engine) in the market, but if there's the active customers are only interested in the best serviced car or the cheapest car, the best car may well end up in the junk yard at the end of the round.  This sales mechanic makes for an indirect interaction game that can be ruthless as players manipulate the market by designing and pricing cars that match the wants of the customers (which are also chosen by the players).  And there's a side game as well as players upgrade their Grand Prix car with better and better engines to score points in each round's race.  And speaking of races, there's also the race to bonus victory points by being the first to reach some achievement like completing one lap in the Grand Prix or building the first engine rated "3".

Wonderful game that is bound to get a higher score from me once I get to play it a bit more multiplayer. Few times I've played it so far, I've loved it. Even the 2-sided solo test sessions. Simple turn and phase process, but so many crunchy, thematic, economic decisions.

RATING: 7
Clever action selection with a "time track" (like in Glen More). Very thematic, middle-weight car manufactoring game: 
a) you research to improve your factories or hire famous engineers (selecting 1 from 2 open cards)
b) you produce chassis or motor according to your factory level (1-7)
c) you assemble motor and chassis to put the car on the market (which also requires a service worker and a price tag you can select), 
d) you select buyers from four different types, who consider different criteria when buying cars (best chassis, best motor, biggest service team, cheapest price),  
e) and you compete with other players on a racing track.
There are also some bonus point tiles that you collect when completing certain objectives first, e.g. first to have a level 4 motor, first to complete 1 round on the racing track.
 However, the game has awful colors. The board is grey on blue and looks very unattractive. Card and player board illustrations are old-timey and good, but the game board itself just screams: boring!

I watched this game being played by Rahdo. It seemed like my kind of game, and I'm a fan of Cramer. Even though I was optimistic, I didn't know enough about the game to form any preconceived notions before hand. What I found after my first play (2 player with my wife) is that this game rocks! It's really good. Of course you have the central "rondel-like" mechanic, as you do in other games, including Cramer's Glen More. That's not what set this game apart for me. Sure, I enjoy Glen More. I think it's a great game. But this game has something that Glen More doesn't: theme. It's not oozing, it's not even strong. But Kraftwagen has enough theme to keep you engaged and make the decisions interesting and relevant. I'm very happy to own this title. The best part is it can be played in under and hour. This is quite a brain-burner for that time space. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5

 It's deep and makes you think and plan without being over encumbered.  The games are close and tense and there are many equally valid ways to win.  Focus on racing, focus on building sexy cards with hot bodies, focus on cars with big engines, focus on building cheap cars, focus on winning achievement tiles.  They can all be paths to victory and none of them feel too powerful, plus they can all be mixed together for a winning game.

I also love the rondel action track.  It adds a whole other level of strategy to the game.  Do I jump far ahead to do the action I really want right now, but give my opponent(s) a bunch of free actions of their turn?  It's a point salad game, and a race, with some worker placement elements.

 The graphic design of the game is sleek and appealing and the quality of components was very good.  My wife and I adore it can not wait to play again.

plays well with four players,  competitive balance between getting better action and waiting for your next turn.   Good interaction with multiple paths to victory, but in the end price is king.

I like the time track mechanic, although I might prefer the implementation in Glen More since placing taken actions at the end seems strange (as opposed to placing random new tiles). Also, GM has a point deduction per number of tiles.

Regarding the actual car production and customers etc. I greatly prefer the more involved setup in Automobile. Being able to more or less do whatever I want makes more sense to me than being restricted by the action selection by time track. The interesting thing in Automobile, in my opinion, is the mind games and decisions of what to do assuming that people can do as they please (not as available actions permit).

RATING: 7
Very nice game with a cool theme and nicely worked out. The mechanism from Glen More actually works a lot better here, I believe.

There are some issues I have with the game, though.

First of all, the luck of the cards.

Secondly, the use of symbols that look the same ( car body/engine) but don't act the same. For example, the car body as an action means produce a car body, whereas on a card it means it increases your level. It's making my head hurt just typing this.

Finally, actions that would instinctively be assumed to work the same way but don't: engine and car body (see also the symbology issues above). The engine cannot be sold right away whereas a car body can. Why?!? Furthermore, the engine can be used to upgrade your own car's engine (huh?), whereas car body has no multiple functions.

Another point I didn't like is how restrictive the game is to taking actions. If you take the triple action and don't want to take a card, you have to, even if that causes you to place your final engineer on it and block yourself out from selling another car. This is what happened in the game I played, and my engine reached level 8 and car body level 9 :s

The game is pretty interesting, the main mechanic is the revisiting of the action selection "rondel" of Glen More and Matthias Cramer.
Just like in Glen More the player furthest to the back will be the active player and he will select one of the free actions to perform and if he's still the last player in the rondel he will go again... So in this game players will not have the same amount of actions and this is pretty cool because it forces you to make a difficult choice to see if it's worth skipping a bunch of actions to do that particular action in the perfect timing, but in doing that you'll be given a potential high number of actions to the players behind you.

The difference to Glen More is that in this game you are not getting properties to grow your village, you are selecting action in order to Produce Engines, Car Bodies, Improving your Research in Both of those items so you can produce better ones or getting Engineers that grant you Special Powers, you are hiring workers, you are enticing Buyers and racing you car in the Grand-Prix.

In addition to all this actions you can send a car to the market at the end of each of your turns and try to be the one to best service the needs of the buyers...

The game is simple and fast... I can see it being played in 1h / 1h15 and I think the length is excellent for the complexity of the game... there are some very interesting choices to be made... 

The components of the game are of very good quality, the cardboard is thick and the art is great, really like the look of the game

Kraftwagen combines engine building (sometimes literally as you build car engines) with an action rondel mechanism, where the last player in the rondel gets to jump to any available action ahead, but the longer you jump, the longer you have to wait for your next turn. I like the market mechanism, where you have to adapt both cars and prices to the current player supply and customer demand. The timing of actions may provide a too strong advantage to the player fortunate enough to offer the last car and by that end the phase. On the other hand, timing is something that players have to take into account in their strategies.

[b]Kraftwagon[/b] was sold via auction 10/15/16.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6/8 -> 6)[/COLOR]

[i]I only managed one more play of Kraftwagen over the course of the last year. There are two main reasons why it is no longer in our collection, player count and Glen More. Kraftwagen was originally designed as a 3+ player game and then had 2p rules added in. Regrettably Kraftwagen really doesn't work as a 2p game because the rondel mechanic falls flat because there isn't a penalty for taking every action the other player skipped over to take their action. Glen More solves that problem in two ways, a dummy die that will destroy tiles and there is a significant VP penalty for every tile you have in excess of the player with the least. I'm not sure of how that could've been solved in the 2p version of Kraftwagen, but as it stands there is absolutely no tension in that portion of the game. 

Once I played Glen More I had absolutely no desire to go back and play Kraftwagen. I felt that Glen More felt more cohesive in terms of the integration of mechanics and theme while Kraftwagen felt like a bunch of separate parts jammed together. Even with more players I found enough similarities between Glen More and Kraftwagen that I'd always rather play the former so I ended up trading my copy of Kraftwagen.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]- Excellent introductory Euro, easy to set up and teach. You can teach the essential rules of the game in 5 minutes and then jump into the game and continue teaching as you go.
- There is a surprising amount of jockeying for position when figuring out which cars to put to market even in a 2p game where you would think the decisions would be pretty straight forward.
- Selling cars is were the most interesting decisions takes place, you need to pay attention to which buyers are out, the order they are buying in and how to price cars (since this is the tie breaker for buyers).
- The action selection mechanic definitely loses something with 2, you are less likely to make big jumps forward and give your opponent a bunch of actions.
- I definitely think this game will shine at 3 and 4 players, it's fun with 2 but not at it's best.

I'm not really sold on Kraftwagen being a great 2p game, I'm looking forward to trying it with more players although I doubt that'll happen at home. This leads to my dilemma with the game, I'm not sure that I like it enough to suggest it at a game night when the number of games I get to play is so limited and I there are so many other games I'd choose to play over Kraftwagen. On the plus side though manipulating the car market is great fun and I can imagine it'd be even better with more players. I'm going to make an effort to get it played with 3 or 4 and see if my suspicions are correct and this game jumps from an average 2p experience to a great 3+ player game.[/i]

Fue un momento de duda. En la otra mesa estaban seteando La Granja y el tablero gris del kraftwagen no resultaba muy atractivo, pero la mecánica de time track es un gancho irresistible. La usé en el Hábitat Espacial y la tienen otros juegos que me encantan, como In the Year of the Dragon y Glen More.

Efectivamente, esa core engine le da un paso fluido, sin AP, porque los efectos son muy progresivos y siempre estás mirando un par de turnos adelante. Las decisiones son siempre interesantes, porque hay que planificar, no es tan táctico. El timing es fundamental, porque hay varias cosas que necesitás llegar a hacer antes que llegue la ronda de scoring. Asi que distraerte con alguna ventajita táctica (Oh! Shinny!) puede terminar costándote caro.

Después de la primera partida, ya da para integrar la expansión (o lo que sea) con los discos de acción más variados. Agregan más opciones interesantes sin agregado de complicación, además de algunos detalles de balance (como las engine 3) que vienen a atender algunos escenarios posibles con muchos jugadores experimentados en el base.

Genial engine, bien integrada la temática, el diseño gráfico demasiado seco para mi gusto, pero en resumen muy recomendable.

Got this 3 years ago and only played once, it's a standard Euro in that there are many different actions and way to score which can make it hard to teach, especially to non-gamers.  Broke it out again recently and actually, it's not that bad.  We played a couple of games in a row and had a good time in both.

The go order mechanic is really interesting and the game is quite thematic.

With an action selection process similar to Glen More where you circle around a path and the player in the active player. Otherwise, the similarities end there since you are collecting different items (engine and body) to present cars to different buyers with each buyer looking for a different characteristic. The mechanics are simple but the round about mechanic is much more straight forward as the actions always remain the same. There is also no penalty for number of actions taken thus running ahead can be costly, so make your choice wisely. A fairly good game, but not one of my favorites.

RATING: 6
Kraftwagen uses the rondel system from another of Cramer's popular games, Glen More. This one feels like it has a bit more meat on it though, as the various actions on the rondel are associated with the various aspects of car manufacturing--research, testing, production, marketing, and staffing. Basically, you build up your expertise in producing car bodies and engines, build them, attract buyers, and then "price" them in the marketplace. At the end of the round, each buyer will buy the car that best meets his preferences, and the owner of that car will get the car's price in points. I enjoyed the exercise, but found it frustrating at times. If you find yourself behind in both types of technology, it's a little difficult to figure out how to cope. Undercutting people in price to steal away their buyer--well, that never struck me as a particularly enjoyable mechanic. I'd play it again, but the game didn't really resonate with me.

Rating could rise or fall with additional plays. I felt like there was very little reason to not vacuum up the actions in a 2 player game. Sure, some were less useful than others depending on the time, but 2 felt a bit weak. It was definitely a departure from Glen More, but still felt somewhat similar.

Looking to see what "V6" edition adds to it.

chaos... and randomness. MEH!
"research" should be on separate track, not on cards. Everybody should have the same chance to level up on "research", not only by luck in cards - cards are worst thing in this game. 
Take card action should be changed to make research action - one point up on research track. Not a game for gamers

RATING: 6
It's a well-made game.  Perhaps it's because I've only played it at 2 players, but it's a teensy bit more vicious than my wife and I usually prefer.  (For those of you who really like take-that in games, it's really not that vicious, just a tad beyond what the 2 of us like.)  The game play is solid, the action rondel is brilliant, and there's enough things going on at once that you really can pull a fast one on your opponent that they should have seen, but got distracted by seeing a shiny new level 6 engine, or because they wanted to go to the race track, or they thought you wouldn't take such a bold move but it really pays off.  Solid game, but I personally have to be in the mood for it.

Oh man.  I brutalized my partner on the first play (not purposefully) and that didn't go well.  There is a fair amount of luck (mostly from the research cards, which are clearly not balanced), which makes the game much more tactical than strategic. There is still a lot of room for smart play in manipulation of the market and the order of actions.

The good parts of this game like the action selection mechanic, can be found in other games by Matthias Cramer. If you want a balanced game about car design, Kanban is a better choice for you. This game has some interesting ideas, but ultimately it fails, because of the common occurrence of a single player taking a large lead in a technological category, and then using that to run away with the scoring. This lead is preventable if everyone is on their toes, but it's easy for a player to get left behind in the first round by no bad play of their own, and never be able to catch up.

A middleweight action placement game

The action track is a nice mechanism where how far you jump ahead to grab a better action determines how long you have the wait. Nice but not as interesting as Glen More since actions recycle. 
The market manipulation of what cars to offer and what will be the desired characteristics can be interesting and is intended to be the meat of the game. 
The race track is nice as a slough off but other than the bonus markers not that useful. 
The way the technology advancement handled by picking from a pair of research cards doesn't work. You are very dependent on the pair of cards available in research when you are positioned to take the research action. It is way too easy for one player to get a heavy technology lead and use it to run away with the scoring. A card draft with some sort of payment would have been a better way to go.
  
This seems to be a case where the game is less than the sum of its parts.

I love the Glen More style rondel and upgrading cars is a real thrill, especially when you get to race them around that little track, but I find the market is a bit too vicious for my tastes. Being first into the market basically guarantees someone will swoop in and undercut you, possibly causing you to score zero points in a round. The game really encourages specializing in a single kind of upgrade, since if you're the only one who can accomplish a 7 power engine/body, you can safely claim the highest price in the market. Overall, Kraftwagen is so close to a great game, but the strongest stratagies are in direct conflict with my preferred play style. Perhaps I'll grow more accustomed to it in the future.

I thought that this was a fantastic game. Played a 2 player version of the game and I had a strategy of getting the best cars to the market while my wife was all about the race track. In the end I was building these 8 body 6 engine cars and my wife was building these 3 body 5 engine cars and she still won but only be a few points.

So from what I can tell you can play either strategy and still have a very competitive game. 

Now my wife had a really hard wrapping her head around how the market and pricing works and that alone caused her to not really like the game. 

Me, I love every thing about it. This is one game that I am really glad that I have in my collection and I just hope that I will be able to find someone that will enjoy it as much as I do.

Plays fast, has excellent components and one sweet ass cover. Am convinced that I'll buy whatever Mr Cramer puts out. Oh and of course it plays excellent with two. This game is a winner.

Kraftwagen is a light-to-middleweight game with a nifty market system as its highlight. Players have to manipulate buyer preferences to match the production aspect they have an advantage in, but even second-rate clunkers can crank out a profit through clever timing of actions. With only 4 out of 6 cars on the market being sold every round, undercutting will inevitably occur to push sales through.

The game also features the action track from [thing=66362][/thing], which allows you to jump ahead and claim a desired action at the expense of having to wait a while for your next turn. Although conservative decisions are favoured a little more in the basic edition, the V6 upgrade spices things up with "super actions" which make bold jumps more tempting.

The game's weak spot lies in the research deck, because having research cards which are 'strictly better' than the rest makes production upgrades rather luck-dependent. The random appearance of upgrades also often leads to players inadvertently competing for the same production aspect. I still find the smooth and interactive design likeable overall – even though I remain abysmal at setting prices after several games.

[1 play]  I’m pleased with how much depth of strategy I saw available after the first turn or two. Looking forward to seeing how differently this might play going forward. Kraftwagen is a good old fashioned euro with quickly understood rules and fast moving gameplay while still offering lots of moments that challenge all of the players to adjust to what the others are doing.

This is a very clever game with some really good parts. The market mechanism is my favorite and what really makes the game shine.

I would prefer a bit more of density in both the goals and the developments. In my opinion the game lacks a bit more of 'things' that may be developed, not only engines and chassis. A third and even a fourth part would turn the game into something more complex but also more fun, for my tastes.

A really good thematic game design that will show you a good time if you take it for what it is (meaning dealing with the luck of the draw of the research deck).

The graphic design on the other hand will dazzle you with a large array of colour going from off-white, to beige, brown and maroon but also grey to faded baby blue.

The game has lots of fields to gauge and play in especially the action selection and the market. It as big race feeling to it with the Grand Prix of course, but also the research, the buyers, the action and end of round. This make the game indirectly interactive.

Played with 3.  I enjoyed it a lot, and I felt like the action selection time track was really wonderfully implemented.  The choices were consistently interesting, and it played fairly quickly.  I have to think that it would play MUCH tighter with 4, and I'm looking forward to trying it at that number.

tl;dr: not as deep as I hoped

A new game from [person=34699][/person] developed by the guy behind [company=15108][/company]. How could this go wrong? Turns out the only way for this to go wrong is having the wrong expectations going in. It's not published by Spielworxx, so it's not a Spielworxx game.
This game reuses the same action/turn order mechanism found in Cramer's own [thing=66362][/thing]. A good choice, because this is a great mechanism. Do you jump ahead to take the great actions or do you stay behind and pick up the leftovers, but lots of them? That combined with the theme of building and improving cars (you will find similarities to both [thing=109276][/thing] and [thing=39351][/thing]) works well. It doesn't really do anything new and it doesn't need to, it just needs to do everything well. And it comes close, but for me it was slightly lighter than I hoped and it doesn't do any of what it does in a great way, it does in in a fine way.

So all in all a solid game that I hoped would be great.

RATING: 8
When it comes many modern boardgames, there is the notion of the "station" on the board. Each station allows you to perform a particular type of action, or else provides you with one opportunity among many to score victory points. In the extreme, these stations feel disjointed and unrelated. I typically point to a game like Trajan, which is a game I enjoy and yet can't understand why Feld didn't put more effort into making the game's theme and its many stations feel more cohesive.

Kraftwagen goes the other direction. It's been a while since I played an action selection/point accumulation game that felt so thematically integrated and logically connected. Despite the existence of different stations on the board, they all feel part of the same overall game, and it is easy to see how one relates to the others. For example, to score point, you can pick up achievements, perform well on the racetrack each round, or sell more and more expensive cars. Yet none of these actions are isolated. You must research better technology to obtain a faster car for the track, and yet better technology also allows you to sell more desirable cars while you pick up certain research-related achievements. Nothing is separate, and it all makes sense if you know about the history of automotive development.

For this alone, I'm impressed. However, the game in general is a solid middle-weight entry with enough strategic subtly to keep me interested game after game. Better yet, it works across the player count even if a four-player game is probably tightest, and therefore best. The action selection mechanism will look familiar to fans of Cramer's Glen More, and yet it works differently in Kraftwagen. You're no laying tiles, but merely selecting from amongst a series of increasingly desirable actions that recycle around the board. Yet the order matters. If I select a certain action now, that means it will come up quicker the next time around the circle. The way the order changes with every lap means there are enough differences to, like everything else in the game, introduce strategic decisions that sneak up on you in a charming way.

Kraftwagen is a solid design that is over before you want it to be, which is always a good sign that there is more to the game than first impressions. Definitely recommended.

Definitely my favorite of all the car building games I've played (Automobile, Automania) as I really enjoy the turn order mechanism and the quick play time. Definitely a few ways to score points, there is no set strategy for victory. The cards are definitely swingy, so don't expect this to be super strategic.

RATING: 4
Much like Steam Time, The Voyages of Marco Polo, and a number of other modern euros, this game just takes familiar concepts and mixes them together. For me, that's perfectly fine.

To start, we have starting resources similar to Tzolk'in. Each player drafts a tile that gives them different starting stuff.

The main game is driven by the same sort of action selection that Glen More and Tokaido use. Whoever is in the back of the line gets to take a turn, and you can move ahead as far as you want but you probably won't get a turn for a while if you do.

There are various cards that give you either instant, one-time effects, or permanent upgrades to enhance your other actions.

Overall it seems like a really good system but I've only played part of a learning game so far. Will rate after more plays.

Update: I've now played a full four-player game. Something about this game just seems off. I love the mechanisms, but it feels like the cards maybe weren't tested enough. For example, there are cards that give you one body research point, and cards that give two body research points. It can happen that one of each card is available at the same time, so there is no reason to ever pick the one research point in that case. Some of the cards also seem like they could be potentially overpowered, especially the one that can triple your sale value. In a game where scoring an achievement gives you a decent 3 or 7 points, this card can alone can net you over 20 points if properly utilized, just for doing what you would normally be doing.

I wanted to love it, and I'm still giving it a decent rating for what it's trying to do, but a few things just don't sit well with me.

Sold.

Kraftwagen is a game about German automobile manufacturing at the beginning of the automation era. The game is fairly quick but has some interesting decisions. It plays over 3 rounds. Each round there will be a scoring round where points will be awarded for a Grand Prix race and for cars sold in the market.

In the game you'll be building car bodies, car engines, getting workers, running your car in the race, bringing a buyer to market, or doing research (which usually makes you better at doing the other stuff in some way). On your turn you always have the option to send a car to the market if you can and want.

The main mechanic in the game is a action selection mechanism similar to Glen More. The player farthest behind on the action track selects any action from those available. They move their marker to that spot and the action they selected is moved to the front of the action line. Then the player who is now farthest behind goes. You don't get to take another action until all the other players pass you. So if you take an action that is very far ahead in the action track, it will be a long time before you get to go again... but if you take a closer action, other people may claim the juicy actions you really wanted before you have a chance to grab them.

When six cars are put into the market it triggers the end of the round (it can also be triggered if the market is full of buyers and you've tried to add buyers 4 times and couldn't). First you score who's ahead in the Grand Prix Race (which is reset after the round). Then cars are sold in the market but only some cars will be sold (in a four player game at most only 4 of the 6 cars will be sold).

The market is the other key mechanism of the game. When you submit a car to the market, you select which car body you'll send, which engine, how many workers and what price you'll charge (you can select from a set of 8 different price markers). Each buyer will have one of four different preferences, body, engine, service (as represented by workers), or price.

Cars will be sold in the market in the order that buyers came into the market. So if the first buyer values engines, the first car sold will be the one with the highest value engine. If there is a tie, the buyer will choose the cheaper car. Then you sell the next car to the second buyer according to their preference. Buyers and cars are added to the market over the course of the round, so what will sell and what won't is in flux. The car you thought had the best engine might not be the car with the highest engine at the end of the round. Or the car that you submitted to compete for best car body might find that none of the four buyers cares about the car body.

There are various goals for being the first player do do different accomplishments. There are some special engineers that let you break game rules in various ways. And that's pretty much the game.

I was surprised how quickly the game played. And despite being a fairly straightforward game I found it to be interesting and challenging. I enjoyed it quite a bit.

A fantastic game. The up-and-coming car company theme behind the game is great fun, and the car meeples are lovely. The game pieces and the cards are all of great quality, but everything is a bit bland. The cars and engineers are an exception to that though, I love the look of them. 

For a medium-weight Euro, the game is easy enough to learn; I haven't had much trouble in teaching it. The rondel action selection works very well in the game, and the various methods to success work into the theme as well. I could (and want to) play many, many games trying out various strategies, which speaks volumes about the design. The 2 player game works well, and it's enjoyable if another player or two can't be found. 

One of my unexpected favorites.

This probably shouldn't get played with 4 players. There's too much randomness with research cards and not enough going on that a player could get trapped with almost nothing to do.

There is luck in whether the sequence on the Action Track may or  may not be favorable to your needs at the right time.  There is luck in the timing in which the different Research cards are made available for the taking.

The real fun, though, is in the delicious mischief one can apply when placing a completed automobile into the Marketplace, as in one that undercuts an opponent's pricing and steals the sale.

Very good game with reasonably simple rules, not so long game play and a great mechanism of action choosing. Also, the market mechanism is another great idea. Two elegant mechanics work perfectly well togheter here and the game flows on spectacularly well.
Only doubt: it seems that the point for completing more laps aren't worth the hassle... just one more point for having completed the 5th lap ??? ok, i could do that with a 7valued engine and jumping over 3 opponents but still, I have to spend a move for that... dunno...
Anyways, great game that i'll play again gladly

Manufacturing and economic worker placement sim set in Germany during the dawn of the automotive industry.  This is the first game of this genre that really speaks to me.  I love the interaction of all the elements. Specifically, I really enjoy the Glen More style action rondel with random seeded actions and the leap frogging turn order. Build up your tech tree, while attracting customers and meeting their demands while keeping an eye out for opportunities to undercut the competition. Add to this the mini-sub game of teching out your entry in the Grand Prix race and striving to be first to earn in-game achievements--really fun. Very thematic, smooth play, and intuitive to learn, play and teach.

Probably won't play it again, having played it to death now.

The only thing I liked was the race for customers and race for cars on to the market.

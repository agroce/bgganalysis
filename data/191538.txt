For the age group, this game is pretty good.  It's light and cute so the kids enjoy the challenge.  For adults, of course this game is 'easy'.  But with the right group, this game is a hoot.  Using the variants for adults helps such as no talking to each other.

The game is pure memory, which means it's almost automatically something I don't personally like. It feels so light, but you also must concentrate very hard on remembering things.

However, the game is cute, as players try moving Leo along a path to get a hair cut. All the path tiles are flipped upside down, and when you move Leo, you'll flip them over to reveal a chatty animal that holds Leo up on his trip to the barber. He only has a certain number of hours, so he inevitably fails on his first attempt, but he tries again with the knowledge gained from that first trip, hopefully avoiding time consuming encounters on subsequent attempts.

Overall, really cute, and good if you like memory games. I'm just not in that camp.

Pure memory game where kids have to memorize the path hoping to land on the same color tiles or signpost tiles in order to not advance the time. The 30 path tiles seem challenging at first, but you do get 5 tries before you lose. I was surprised how well my 5-year old did at memorizing the tiles and realizing when she didn't have the right card to get to a tile she knew and would have to guess. The third play seems to be our lucky charm we are 4 for 5 in wins all coming on the 3rd day. I'm glad I picked this up for my daughter and she actually picks this out so I know it's a hit with her.

A very good children game. Simple, without revolutionary new mechanics like hidden magnets, fluorescent pawns, hanging spiders but still addictive. I had some reserve to the theme (may be to childish to a 6 year old player) but it wasn't a problem. I played with a lot of children at a fair and all of them came back to play again the game.

Leo é o mais recente proposta do autor Leo Colovini, O jogo estava entre os três indicados Kindespiel des Jahres 2016 e conquistou a vitória do Deutscher Spiele Preis como jogo infantil do ano na Alemanha. Na dinâmica do jogo a memorização é muito importante. Leo é um leão com uma grande juba. Então, ele decide ir para a barbearia mas ao longo do caminho, Leo encontra muitos animais com quem ter um bate-papo, atrasando sua visita ao barbeiro. O objetivo de cada jogador é lembrar de todos os animais que vão ao encontro de Leo no caminho e, mais importante, chegar ao barbeiro antes que a juba cresça demais

RATING: 7
Cute cooperative game for children, and almost a party/cooperative game for adults.  Players team together to play cards, trying to get Leo the Lion down a track to the barber's for a haircut.  You play a numbered card to move Leo, flip the tile face up that he lands on, and either chews up time or not depending on whether you colour matched the tile/played card.  If you use 12 hours during the trip, you bust and have to try again (using your memory to remember what tiles you flipped up).  More fun than it has any right to be, and quite tough!

2017-01-07 : First play and it's the kid's new favourite game. And I can see why : it's a memory co-op that's very easy to grasp but with real decisions to be made. Given the designer it's not surprising there's a bit of Carthagena in there too. I'm not a fan of memory games (because I suck at them), but I'll gladly make an exception for this one.

Wonderful game for the younger set. I think age 5-7is the sweet spot for this cooperative memory game, but it is good fun for everyone.  A win is not guaranteed but it is probable-a positive feature given the target demographic. The art work is terrific and the theme is developed in cool ways in the details of the components.

Clearly (and sold as) a kids' game. But no less fun for that. Needs some modifications to make it any challenges at all - simply always playing the biggest value that you have should position you for a win on day 2/3. 

I'm considering minimising the number of corners and removing the sign posts (though that would reduce the number of tiles, which makes it easier). Perhaps adding some penalty/obstacle tiles might work.

Jópofa társas, de nem igazán tudom hova tenni. Maga a játékmenet szórakoztató; nem könnyű megjegyezni a lapkákat, és ez kooperatív játék lévén vicces helyzeteket szül (kompetitív játékban inkább frusztráló és fáradtságos lenne). A játék taktikai része a megfelelő kártyák kijátszásában rejlik, és ezáltal a kommunikáción van a fő hangsúly, ami egy alapjaiban memóriára építő társas esetében izgalmas koncepció.
Azt sajnálom, hogy mérsékelt a kihívás benne. Oké, gyerekjáték, de a nehezítésekkel is mindig "simán" nyertünk. Plusz valahogy a végső eufória elmarad (más koop nagyobb sikerélményt nyújt).

規則:
*放置起始板塊並把里歐棋子放在上面，所有路徑板塊洗勻蓋著排成一直線(可彎曲只要形成一條路即可)終點放波波的理髮店，里歐的頭與頭髮板塊放一旁，時鍾轉到8
*頭髮最長的起始，所有牌洗勻平均發(3人時有兩人會多一張)，不能分享卡牌內容
*遊戲最多進行5輪，如果五輪內能在時限內里歐到達理髮廳則獲勝，否則一起失敗
*由起始開始輪流出一張牌到面前，走對應數字格數並打開板塊，如果顏色跟出的牌一樣或是上面顯示0則時鍾不動，否則時鐘要轉對應板塊的格數，然後輪流換下個玩家
*當時鐘到達或經過8時把里歐放回原點，一輪結束，頭髮板塊拼上去一個，指針設回8，下一位玩家當起始，移動卡重新洗勻重發，所有板塊翻回去蓋著
*一般規則：玩家可以給予另一個玩家提示，以提醒他們打出什麼樣的卡片最好，而且也可以彼此分享路徑板塊的資訊。不過最終還是得由當回合的玩家做出最後打出什麼卡片的決定。
**變體***
簡單點  手牌正面朝上放在面前。玩家一起決定當回合的玩家打出哪張卡片會比較好。
困難點  只有當里歐抵達一個鸚鵡板塊時才能討論
更困難 波波理髮店前的最後一個板塊一定要停，然後才能經過過關

RATING: 6
It's a memory game, so it's never going to rate much higher than a 6, but getting to a 6 at all rates it as a pretty good memory game. I can see why it's marketed with a kid's theme given its simplicity, and I can imagine it well suited there. Basically you play movement cards, memorise the tiles you land on, and then when you land on too many wrong tiles, start your run again and organise to play movement cards between you that land you on as many damage-minimised tiles as possible. Have a third run if needed, but with adults who are concentrating it should be do-able, and provides a rewarding moment when the challenge is met and the game won. But of course you could be playing a game that doesn't have a memory element!

Update: Third play with 'must flip last tile' rule to add dramatic tension. More engaging after the first 'day' as you factor in what you can remember and what cards are held. The recall aspect is challenging, but also satisfying when correct/lucky. My 4yo is learning his clock, recalling colour at a location (I sometimes ask for his help), enjoys the journey and adding more hair, but by the 4th run through he starts to lose interest, so I see this game more suitable for 5-6 year olds. 

Hmm, first run-through (literally as me and my 2 sons playing the high numbers) resulted in getting Leo luckily into the barbers chair no problem: no resistance and the tension quickly evaporated in the high fives. 

That feeling might explain why my eldest wasn't hooked into playing again, this time I added the variant difficulty rule of having to flip the last tile to see if we made it on time. Remembering that KEY number and colour card adds to the challenge as you have to factor that into how to land on it with enough time. 

Failed on the second play as trying to remember the colours and their location to crack efficiently is challenging, but is it too much that you want to pull your hair out.....

The best mix of memory and strategy in a children's game I have seen so far. I usually hate memory based games but this is actually really good. You can use house rules to make it harder, for example you have to first enter the last tile and only then you can enter the barber. Probably a bit too easy with two players, seems to be best with three players.

A kids cooperative game with a neat twist - the group playing needs to collectively memorise things that would probably be hard for one person to remember in entirety. Add some pure luck (landing on good tiles) and random card distribution and you have a reason to discuss ideas and you have a shared collective experience.

Pretty neat co-op. There's shared memory, shared taking of risk and pure guesswork. (and Lion's mane, that's cool).

Leo is quick to teach and fun to play as well as cooperative.  That combination of attributes results in a family-friendly game as well as a refreshing filler for hobby gamers.  It’s a good game to lightly work the mind without being thinky.  There is some randomness and and luck can be a factor, but these aren’t really issues since play time is short and the game is meant to be light-hearted.  I enjoyed playing Leo and would definitely suggest playing it again in the future.

Very nice cooperative childs game.

Especially good with smaller childs.
You have 5 days (tries) to get the task done. 
You will not succeed on the first day, unless you get very lucky. Usually you need 3 days.
But even if you need 5 days, it still feels like a win, which makes the childs happy.

Use a variant to reduce hand size to 5 (with drawing after playing a card) when playing with less than 4 players. Otherwise it gets too easy, especially in a 2 player game.

You can reduce the number of way posts to increase difficulty.

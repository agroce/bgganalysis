A bland game of collecting cards to meet set requirements.  There are a few other, minor things but that's about it.  It's the kind of game I can't see appealing to gamers or even really family groups.  I played with 2 players and I bet it would be slightly more interesting with 3 players, but only slightly.

RATING: 5.5
Almost too light for me, and certainly too short. I love the art and the main market mechanic, with money giving you more access to interior cards and the special abilities giving you instant benefits. I do not like having only two goals to choose from at the beginning of the game (with no public goals to fall back on), as it can give one player a huge advantage based solely on luck. I'd love to see a variant/fix for this, as I love the look and feel of the game. It seems all of the ingredients are here for a good game. I'll keep my fingers crossed...

A very simple game with very minor timing problems for the players to solve presented in a package with lots of attention to get the train wagon artwork correct. It's too simple for grizzled boardgamers, and I fear it's even too simple for family gamers. It has a finished feel to it, which is good, and in some way I think the game does not truly deserve this low a rating... but I think a bit of an extra challenge would not stand amiss. I do not see the need to revisit this game after my initial go.

Splendor in a tin for travel.  Actually has one more layer of depth than Splendor.... whole lotta game for < $10.  (Sort of Bazaar-like, but I don't see any Ticket to Ride in it.) Not so sure on repeated plays, but enough to justify the price. 

Select train cars to achieve goals and objectives.  

Per the tin:  " Opportunism.  Secret Objectives.  Set Collection."  20 mins.

Continental Express is one of the small card games in the Bombyx line that comes in a gorgeous impressed tin. I love small card games, card drafting games, games with secret objectives, games in tins, trains and train themed games so this seemed like the perfect fit for me. You are each dealt 2 contracts at the beginning of the game and each player chooses one of two. You then take turns drafting cards from three face-up rows - the card on the end of each row costs nothing, the card in the middle costs $1, and the card closest to each of the three decks costs $2. You start with no money, however, and the only way to get some is to draft it. If you have train cars matching one of the three face-up objective cards, you can choose to discard those train cars and claim the objective. Objectives have the icons that satisfy contracts. In addition to train cars and money, you can draft characters, taking the special action of a character when you draft one. When someone claims their fourth objective, each other player takes one more turn, then the game ends.

Even though it was a bit simple, I quite liked my first play of it but my gaming partner was quite frustrated and annoyed with drafting from the market. He didn't like the way it was set up, or that whenever he settled for what he perceived to be his least optimal move then he made a better option cheaper for me. He didn't want to play it again (which is rare for him because he is always willing to give games a second try) so I was never able to get it back to the table. :(

RATING: 4
Components: good quality on the cards
Complex: really easy to learn and teach
Weight: family/ light
Players: 3 or 4
Length: around 30 mins
Mechanics: pick up cards, fill objectives
Decisions: nor much, which card to pick or which objective you can fill
Opinion: not a bad filler, light game. You have to pick wagons in order to fulfill some objectives. The idea is good, because depending on which objectives you complete you will have more points, and can complete a secret final objective.
On the other hand, the simplicity is not a good point in this one. You have 3 rows to pick up a wagon, and there are some characters that can help you with your objective, but, in the end, you finish picking what is the best option for you. It could be very rare that you have more than one choice to do. On these 3 rows, you can pick the lower card at no cost, the rest cost money, but the money is also on the rows, so most of the time you will be picking the only option you have.
You have also some final objectives, but there is no option, no length to plan for them. These objectives depend on which ones you are completing during the game, and you are completing the ones you can. If you plan to go for some bigger ones, or some looking for this secret objective, the game could finish without any option for you.
I would play the game sometimes, but it will not be my proposal. The game is played really fast, and this is a plus, but the lack of options and decisions makes me to select other games before this one

A fine game, but the more players you add, the more chaos you get. I would prefer it as a 2 player or 3 player game, only.

However, that won't put it much higher (just more playable), as the game just doesn't have any depth.

Continental Express is a quick and enjoyable game which takes the theme of building up a train yard and allows it to be done in 15 - 20 minutes.  While it doesn't have the depth of other train games, it's certainly a fun experience and mixes luck and strategy in a great way that never makes it feel like you don't have a chance to be competitive.  Excellent filler.

RATING: 2
Nowhere in the rules does it state that flat cars depicted on the objective cards don't actually exist and therefore don't need to be fulfilled.  It's also annoying that the cards are all mismatched front to back such that as you lay out the row you must also flip each card vertically. Finally it's all too often that the contract you have cannot be fulfilled at all due to nothing other than no matching objectives coming up.  This should almost make the game broken by definition but I understand it to be the very lightest of games even lighter than Ticket to Ride.  In that vein despite any of the above complaints it just lacks any clever game play mechanic or any tense or meaningful decisions for me to want to ever play it again.  Sure you pick from the rows but it's either obvious by far what to choose or completely doesn't matter.  Maybe it would be good with kids younger than 8.  I do love the artwork and the tin artwork as well.

An array of train cars is presented, and on each turn you select one. If you complete an objective (a specific set of train cars), you can claim it, and those are worth points. You also have hidden goals you're trying to accomplish. Locomotives are random. More like a card game version of Ticket to Ride than Ticket to Ride: The Card Game, this is a pleasant, attractive little game that you can fill some time with. Its main weak spot is that it fills a niche that most people have filled several times over and aren't really looking for more of.

Pick a card and hope that you get to fill a ticket with it. If not, you'll fall behind without any possibility of catching up. The take that cards included do not really help either, and the secret goals are poorly balanced.

Very simple, but despite first appearances it works. Quick and decent game. It has got quite a bit better with further plays. Players are blocking bonuses based on educated guesses, looking to block opponents train selections, etc. the bonus is that it plays in about 10 minutes and despite initial queries of whether the game had been play tested we've found it all well designed after all.

Played once with 4P. Continental Express is a set collection game in which players purchase passenger cars from one of three lines. Sets of cars can later be turned in for one of the available train objectives. Mixing things up a little is the presence of special characters, events and hidden scoring objectives. 

Continental Express might be a nice fit as a small family game – it's simple, quick and requires some luck to get cards you need. Another point in its favour is its great artwork, although I had a bit of trouble telling the passenger cars apart at a quick glance. However, it doesn't do anything new or innovative to distinguish itself from the crowd.

Single play failed to suggest any hidden depths. Take the best of the 3 available cards, which are either (a) awesome or (b) of no immediate use. Maybe you can then claim one of the 3 available objectives, maybe you can't. My hidden objective was essentially unachievable due to the order these cards came out. Ah well, its short, but not short enough.
 
Attractive art, but kind of muted. Cards are too small.

I opened the rules and thought "This is going to suck."  Alas, it did not!  Its the perfect length for what it is.  10 more minutes and I would have been bored.

A great gateway game.

Collect cards Pax Po style, to complete contracts that are face up, whilst also trying to score you secret objective, dealt to you at the start of the game.

It's all very gentle and fast (ten minutes tops), but is a very attractive little filler. I doubt it'll get hundreds of plays, but with such a short play time (and really, that was pretty much all the rules) it's easy to use to fill a tiny gap on games day.

Shorter alternative to Ticket to Ride, although I feel the design in this game could have been better. The wagons look all the same, the characters are way too powerful and the count is very odd. I largely prefer Splendor over this, despite the fact theme is stronger in Continental Express.

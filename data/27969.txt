It isn't like we weren't warned; chaos is in the title and that's what we get, lots of it.  I can see that this game has interesting strategic options, but for my taste they are overwhelmed by the chit pulls, uncertain turn length, random determination of how much an alliance can move, combat that adds even more randomness to a six to hit system, and event cards with game-changing effects.

For what is a fairly simple game, I found the rules hard work. The current four pages of the BGG rules forum testify to a lack of clarity. Significant errata should not have been necessary for what is a re-issue.  

Physical production is mostly to MMP's usual standard, which is to say a paper map and small, thin chits.  The cards are good quality. I like the map artwork, though the counters strike me as too busy.

With a more clearly written rulebook the rating would probably be much higher. As we play each time and have to review the rules again to clarify minor or sporadically appearing situations we get more comfortable and enjoy the game even more. Betrayal cards can be huge and seiges with "overwhelming odds" are not always a given. My opponent and I like the game enough where we are considering rewriting rules in an indexed format to include all erratta and clarifications.

RATING: 8
I'm a big card driven gamer who prefers lower chit density games. So basically this game meets neither of those two needs, but yet I really, really like it. Well, I like the 30 turn full game. Most of my games have come down close to the wire with a few end of game chit pulls making all of the difference. I'm not a fan of the 10 turn game as it really just boils down to whether Oda gets enough chit pulls to have a chance at winning.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Tough one to call. It's very chaotic. Not necessarily bad. I've enjoyed the couple times I've played the "short" game. But the 10-turn version really is just too swingy, and it doesn't give enough time for the madness of the system to even out; the Oda need to get on a bit of a roll to get traction, but if they don't get the chits, they just have no chance to win. But, on the other hand, 30 turns is a lot, and would take 6 hours to play to conclusion most likely - and I just don't think A Most Dangerous Time wants to be 6 hours, given the chaos level. A rather interesting game, but I wish it were shorter. In the end it'll probably stick around in my collection in the hopes of playing the full game sometime, but I dunno. Like almost all IGS games, it's just too long.
---
This is a game I enjoyed playing the once I played it, and would like to play some more, but it may fall into the chasm of games that are not worth their learning curve. You clearly need to play a time or two to get a handle on it, but the learning process is more work than fun, and it just may not be worth it. I'd like to play it again, but I can see that not happening for a year or two and the game ending up on the flea market pile.

map looks great, the counters look great.  I'm disappointed with the box cover and the card design.  Brown really doesn't do it for me.  Maybe it should've been off-white.  Also, would've liked either a more striking image a la the burning fortress from Ran done in Fire in the Sky-style, or the mon in black without the blood spot.  Oh well.

Hope this game lives up to the hype.  Can't wait to play.

Light wargame with enough chrome to raise it to Light Medium weight. High degree of chaos, although that's appropriate for this period (if annoying to control nuts). However, there's a lot to keep you thinking about yet elegant movement and combat systems. This may be the game that gets me interested in this period of history.

Interesting theme, reasonable playing time, and the betrayal mechanic is a nice touch but whoa, the chaos is out of control. Buckets o' dice combined with a chit draw system that can totally screw Oda make this a beer & pretzels game at best. Give me [i]Sekigahara[/i] over this any day.

Sengoku Jidai, an interesting military period for feudal Japan. The illustrated map and counters are attractive to the eye. The rulebook leaves a lot of guessing, ambiguities and questions which are solved only after having a look at the errata, clarifications and played a sample game to comprehend the mechanics of play. After that the chaos of the period unfolds before you. Lots of crucial elements are taken in consideration: negotiation, betrayal, siege and field combat, movement restrictions, leadership, sea lanes, out of command situations and fortifications. The game has a lot of randomness and the best military plans can be ruined by Lady Luck. Each player has a lot of options to consider and very many fields of action. This is supposed to be a chaotic period but troops can wait indefinitely for orders to move on or take actions on crucial situations because of the chit pull mechanic. Combat is abstract but gives historical results. The game is a nice attempt to approach the conditions, back stage politics and clashes of that era.

Really nice-looking rulebook.  Wow!  However, the rules themselves have some frustrating gaps, which is odd considering this is a reprint.  Be prepared to wrestle with them a bit.  

Nevertheless, the game and the scenario are good in this asymmetric struggle.  There's a good game here.

Non-Oda player: stick it out until the Takeda show up and then evaluate the game.  You'll find that the tables do turn on the Oda player that's been kicking your butt!

RATING: 7
Flipping through the rulebook, I wouldn't say that learning the rules is a simple task, but once the game starts moving, it's all falls into place instinctively with little need for rules reference. 

Chit-pull, with a buckets of dice combat system plus dice for movement points could have the potential to end up as a hugely random game. But it doesn't quite happen here. The forces and strategic situation here are balanced and prevents the game from degenerating into a wild mess. There is a lot to think about here and a lot of it has to do with crisis management but it never feels that you have run out of options even when the dice thrusts another crisis on to you. (I concede that the sudden ending of turns can be a major game-changer, if it happens too often in detriment of one side, and seems to argue in favour of the daruma chit.)

There's also another random element through the card draw but the cards seemed to be one of the letdowns in the game, particularly compared with the rest of the game system. Some cards seemed too bland and generic, while some were extremely powerful.

Rating after one play.

Very accessable and quick to get into playing (once you get past the set up time). Enjoyable game play with swings in fortune (you roll for movement ("The die IS for movement." ;-) but each movement point may be used for stacks of units/leaders except for sea movement where it's 1 for 1 ) and initiative in field combat. If you control Kyo you automatically get 2 added to your movement die roll and there are cards you may play to add 2 to your movement points anytime during the movement portion of your turn.

Chit pull to activate differing clans/alliances with one 'End of Turn' chit in the mix.

Six to hit with die modifications adding (or subtracting) from each number rolled.

Oda was doing well and eliminated a large clan around turn 5 but was then attacked and killed. Me thinks the lieutentant Samari need to be used more in combat (I was able to draw a Daimyo 'upgrade' card for a Samari of my choice). Killing off a clan permits their soldiers to be put into play on the other player's side and supplements Oda's initial force. But alas, I didn't have another turn or 2 to get them into play.

Ready to play again - recommended.

Originally my rating was an 8 but the game grew on me and I feel that this is the best game Tetsuya Nakamura has ever designed(that I know of, played all of his games translated to english). Very balanced, tense, no two games are the same(due mainly to the activation chits). While I admit that without the use of the "good luck" marker, the game is somewhat luck dependant, both players have to think both in the long term and the short term(mainly long term).

Great game, keep up the good work!!!!!

chit pull system with a random end of turn element combined with buckets-o-dice combat system is out-of-control chaos.

From Wargame Depot - Beautiful artwork on this one, and while there's a little confusion in the rules, it's mostly pretty understandable.

Based on a first play (very dangerous for Oda, unfortunately), I'll give this a 7.5.

I'm still pawing thru the rules for little things (like the use of the Iron ship tile, or when the Murakami clan enters) that I wish had been collected on a separate ref card. Once I get it all down, I think this stands to rise in score.

It's here, and it's a beauty. The linen-finish cards are especially nice, much better than anything from GMT that I've seen, although that does interfere with legibility in a couple places where the text is smallest. The counters look really sharp and the map is just outstanding.

There are a few misspelled things on cards and in the rules, along with a bunch of counters that have incorrect backs, which is irksome but sadly par for the course in wargames. I navigated the rules without too much trouble--although they are easily 7 or 8 pages longer than they need to be due to excessively verbose examples. How can a rulebook be this chatty and still leave ambiguities about things like precisely [b]how[/b] Ashikaga uses his diplomatic ability while neutral? There are a few vital clarifications and errata to know about, and some designer rulings that simply do not logically square with the rules text as written (Ikko-Ikki regrouping quirk). 

The game is actually much simpler than it appears on first glance, and it flows quite nicely. There isn't a great deal of bookkeeping and the various procedures can be internalized after just a few repetitions. 

Gamers who value control are advised to steer clear of this game--you might not pull your chits, you might roll poorly for movement allowance, you might keep drawing cards that don't help at all. Combat can be quite swingy, since with a lousy roll your side may get fired upon in a round without you being able to reply. Siege combat is resolved painlessly, but you'll need big stacks to take down a brave leader holed up in a level 2 or 3 castle. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
This didn't feel like managing chaos so much as resolving it.  Between the chits, the blow out combats and the event cards, the players seemed to be present more as referees than gamers.  Probably my own failing, but I couldn't see how playing Oda would be very fun either...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
I think game is quite broken out of box. combat is luckfest without real control, cards are hit or miss and could affect game hugely, chit system could dominate game as well. Short scenario does not work good. Biggest problem is that you can do very little to mitigate luck in this one. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This would be a nine if it had a clear rulebook. However the gameplay is so good that even with a poor rulebook it is a blast.  A lot of chaos built into the design (e.g. rolls for initiaive) but the way it comes together still works well -- the better player will win despite all the dice rolling.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A fun game which suffers some deficiencies.

The combat system is quiete odd. Strong fortresses are too difficult to storm and in many battles only one side gets to fire (the one which won the initiative for the combat round) while the other side does nothing else than taking hits. In my opinion this is neither balanced nor realistic.

But the largest problem are the rules which are a complete disaster. I am not a very demanding person on that but here you'll have to check first a myriad of erratas (major and minor ones) and clarifications before you get to start playing. 

It's a shame as the gameplay itself is really tense and fun with a lot of unexpected swings of fortune and otherwise this product deserved a MUCH higher rating! 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Ancient Japan military conflicts.  I hope they can have kanji on the map but seems not so to avoid cluttering. Not an easy situation to simulate but it was done by the Japanese designer so it gotta be better.  This should be selling like hot cakes at time like this - A Most Dangerous Time. 

The rules are easy to absorb. For example, the line of communication rules reduce the number of units a Daiymo can bring along the roads if the force is out of communication with its home castle. Neat. Maintaining a line of communication (not counting the space the unit is in) back to the Home Castle or starting space (those without a Home castle) is crucial to all factions. The line is lost if any of the space along the trace is not controlled by the faction.  Efficiency of the movement is reduced (each unit is counted as two along the road) and of the combat is reduced (each unit is counted as half in combat). Each hit would eliminate two out-of-communication units (bloody stuff).  A leader initiative roll is also reduced by one.  Again, these rules are neat and clever.     

Chits-pulled based activations of the Daiymos in the Impulse Phase and when the "Turn End" chit is picked, play proceeds to Turn End Phase for performing administrative stuffs like regroup, disband and illness checks. Now, the only question is Oda or Anti-Oda...

The mechanics and the systems in this game are very solidly made and composed to reflect the many special features pertaining to the warring states of Japan. The betrayal stuffs via negotiations or event cards are portraying so lively the many side-changing stories during the Unification War.  Since negotiations always happen before combat, you can always try to talk the enemies over first before taking military actions. The chance is 1/6 under the normal circumstance looking for a dieroll of 6.  And since the presence of Daimyo and Samurai always modify the dieroll, only the neutral unit or one that is besieged would it be defected.  How simple but effective to relate the chance of a unit's defection to the level of pressure exerted by leadership and under siege.       

The (action) chits-pulled based activations of the Daiymos' factions drive the game, during the Impulse Phase and when the "Turn End" chit is picked up, play would proceed to Turn End Phase for performing administrative stuffs like regroup, disband and illness checks. For those who are familiar with Richard Berg's (Waterloo, Battles for North Affrica) and Mark Walker's (World at War series) designs, you would feel right at home.  Some may think the mechanic is luck-dependent, I think it is exciting.  Plus, it gives different narratives every time you play!

This is the only game I have seen so far that can successfully integrate complex diplomatic situations, different clans, factions on the two main opposing alliances, with the common military aspect of siege combat with castles and temples.  There are plenty strategic decisions for the player to make during the game.

A minor quibble might be that since both sides can have 8 units in a single space, the space is absolutely too small to place 16 units in one place on the map without crumbling of the stack.  You can find the same in Russian Front, a favorite game to many others.  I hope you would love A Most Dangerous Time as much as I do.  There is a lot to study in this game.

One of the best games I have ever played.  Play is edgy and the mechanics fit the theme perfectly.

The thirty turn is the only way to play competitively.

If you can get past the rulebook, then there is a good game here that puts the "C" in Chaos!  Varying alliances, sieges, event cards, etc., make this a very challenging and ever changing game.

Some people would like it some would probably not. I don't like it that much simply due to the fact I've never won in this game.

Those who like chaotic management may like this game a lot while those who are not used to the chaotic feeling may have to struggle to feel their way into the game.

The thing is initiative is drawn and inevitably at some point in the game one side would benefit from the draw so much that the subsequent game advantage fell to his side. This is especially true when both sides took a calculated but strategically important/critical move, the kind of live or die move. And either side is bound to risk a move or two because the two sides are well balanced.

Every single move must be viewed as strategic decision or strategic move since no one knows when a particular alliance would be able to move again.

The game arts itself is terrific though and the theme is strong in this particular game.

First, this rule book is horribly written.  In order to play the game smoothly, multiple reads and necessary online eratta and forum searching is necessary.  Other than THAT large gripe, the game is pretty cool.  A bit more specific and complicated than I was hoping for, even though the basic mechanics, once learned, are pretty approachable.  I'd give it an 8 as a medium-difficulty wargame if not for the craptastic rules.

Luck plays a large role. Quite a few turns were cut short by drawing the end turn marker on the 1st or 2nd draw. 
Plays quickly once got the hang of the rules.

Having played three short scenarios now I feel that the game is excellent.  The complexity is not too high and the production value is top notch.  Lots of interesting decisions to be made in the chit-pull mechanisms and die rolling, though infuriating, makes absolute sense (maybe that's why it's infuriating!).  Add in the Event deck and the game gets a bit nutty.  Not sure if it truly feels a bit like Warriors of God of if I'm just lumping them together.  Love the history cards.  And for some reason, the game photographs really well...

Fantastic wargame! Really like it! Fairly light weight and straight forward rules but there is a lot beneath the surface. The high amount of chaos makes the game highly replayable. The card play is a very clever subgame. The chit pull mechanic makes it play very well solo. (The betrayal cards can be difficult to deal with solo but you just need to imagine what you would do in the situation the best you can.)

Two concerns:
1. The initiative roll is a bit too random and you can really get hosed in a big field battle if you cannot do any firing.
2. It seems balanced in favour of the anti-Oda side. As the Oda player you really need to be able to take out some clans early or else you will just succumb under the combined pressure of all your enemies who come from all directions.

Still, overal a very fun experience and the better player will win most of the time; there is so much randonness that it will even out in the end.

People who don't mind lots of luck in their games will probably love this, but it's a bit too much for me. I feel that the game grinds on to its conclusion, and as a player, I am just a staff member who is there to keep the machinery oiled and running smoothly.

As for the rules and components, there are about 10 counters that are misprinted, and during my first read-through, I found a handful of things that were just wrong. More things have been uncovered since. I don't think the bar for the average rulebook is set all that high in the wargame world, but I still consider this one to be below average in quality.

I currently have this on my wishlist as the most interesting title on the Sengoku period. But still I'm not sure it's good enough. 


UPDATE> Most probably it's not. I won't make any move before I try it first.

Finally got to play this on 2/09/12 and had a good time. We played the short game. 

The game was a lot of fun, but one should understand that there is a lot of luck in the game. The movement, combat, and events all rely on good luck throughout the game, but I did not see this to be much of an issue. It certainly was not more luck than I would like to see. 

The rulebook was quite difficult to use. It could really use an update, and there are a few errors that needed errata. 

Ultimately the game overcame the smaller issues. Now that we have an understanding of how the game plays, we are looking forward to giving the campaign game a shot. 

Kyo is a VERY important space, especially for the Oda player. The extra movement and guaranteed cards that it provides the owning player are a large advantage and one that the Oda player really needs to have in his pocket. I will have more to say about the game after I get a play of the campaign in.

Very good strategic rendition of the events of the Sengoku Jidai, with enough detail and potential to tell a different story at every play. Heavy on luck. Also, rules (and components) should have been polished further. Artwork is really classy.

After 2 ftf games, I have mixed feelings about AMDT but want to give it another shot to test a couple of ideas. It has a large amount of randomness, but preparing and planning for the worse is part of the strategy.Game play flows along smoothly once the rules are understood.Map, rulebook,and counters are works of art not withstanding a couple of printing errors. My biggest complaint is barring great chit pulls I don't see how the Oda faction can win. I am sure there is some kind of hidden concept I am missing that makes Oda more competitive and I hope to find it, so maybe some of the people that rated this game a 9 or 10 will pass along some strategy tips.

Not a bad one, and cool components, but have played it and I think pure luck, even with the Fortune option, means all in this one. Anyway we enjoyed it, but there are two very very weak points in this one: 

1- Besiegin' is so hard you almost can't take any level 2 or 3 fortresses from your opponent's hands, wich leads to a game of "passive" stances on wich you have to wait until you have a huge advantage in numbers to make something happen, specially against the Ikko-ikki if you are Oda (Ishiyama: Hell on Earth XD!!). ¿No bonus at all for the besieger, and all the possible bonuses for the defender?

2- Initiative in battles is pure luck. Luck is always involved in dice-rolling, but in many games combat is simultaneous and both sides have and oportunnity to hurt the enemy. Not in AMDT. You can see many battles when the other guys die by thousands and you suffer no casualties, because you got the initiative, so try to make the picture of a (6-rolling) battle system with also a rule allowing ONLY you to fire. Absolute randomness.

I'd give it a 6. Not bad, but far from excellence.

For trade.Box and components are in good contition.

Impressions after one play :
- the game is very dynamic but also very chaotic, which may be frustrating for some players. My adversary had the impression that I played solitaire during the first half of the short scenario.
- Nvertheless, I appreciated personnaly the gameplay and its chaotic nature. You must be aware that nothing is a given and you must plan accordingly.
- the scenarios suffer from some problems : the short scenario is too short for the luck to even out and the Anti-Oda player is primarily passive. We continued the game after the turn 10 and I feel that the fun begins after that for the Anti-Oda player. The standard scenario (30 turns), which seems the most balanced, is unfortunately too long and needs 2 sessions (we could do 18 turns)
- the rules would really need to be reorganised and updated. As they are, some important rules are contradicted by later errata (for example : betraying of daimyos, initiative drms, order of battles)

All in all, I appreciated the game as I felt it conveys nicely the nature of warfare in this era but the problems I mentioned earlier prevents me to give it more than a 7

Update :

With more play, I begin to get really annoyed with the false rules. Is it really so hard to put forward an updated rulebook ? Hello MMP, did you ever heard of living rules ?

The chaos seems also to be so prevalent in the game as to prevent the player to do anything to mitigate the luck. For example, if Oda has not things going their way in the beginning, it seems as if he got no chance to prevail, between the different forces against him and the numerous cards of the anti-oda faction.

Combine this with a short scenario which is clearly unbalanced without using the good fortune optional rule, a rulebook fraught with errors and I'm beginning to lose patience with game.

Update 2 :

After nearly 4 games, I come to the conclusion that, first, the game is settled by luck rather than skill, second, Oda has nearly no chance to prevail

The game is broken and Oda will lose... almost everytime... But it is a challenge that I enjoy, wether in solo games or 2p games!

Once you  accept that, you can still enjoy the game a lot! I'm not a fan of chit-pulling but it works really well in this game.

Admittedly, this game has a lot of luck in it, but then, it is called "Japan in Chaos", and it captures its theme very well. With all the minute details and different clans and the event cards, this really immerses you in the Japan of Oda Nobunaga.

Brilliant. Evokes the historical period splendidly, much more granular & chrome-filled than the wonderful [b]Sekigahara[/b] (of course) but holding a similar feel by using chit pulls, card driven play, and asymmetrical forces to model the periods insecurity, personalities, and the sweep of a volatile, changing map on a large scale.  

Once you get through a couple of turns & a bit of rules bearding the game is truly smooth & fluid and the asymmetries are a gorgeous, dramatic gaming experience.

Great looking game.  Nice components.  But why a paper map?  I guess that's what you get with war games, as this is my first.

I have yet to play it, but am in the process making a folding board using mat board.

I've found an opponent willing to play, so hopefully I can add something a bit more substantial here.

Hugely fun.  Chaotic, but in a good, tense way.  Chaos is an integral part of this game, and without it the game would likely be a little too dry for my tastes.  Like the Combat Commander series, this game is about learning to manage, or at least survive, the chaos. (That's where the fun comes in)   Nice components, but rulebook is a little confusing.  Don't skip the FAQ on this one.

Mixed feelings about this game. Combat is simple, almost too simple as you move your counters into a space and roll the dice.  I'm not a big fan of chit pull games, especially those with a Turn End chit that can be the first one pulled.  Then you roll the dice to see how much you can move.  In combat, you roll for initiative to see if one or both sides gets to attack and in what order.  As a result, you can end up with turns that nobody does anything, armies in critical positions either can't move at all or can only move a very little bit, and battles where one side hammers away at the other while receiving no damage.  There are cards, but they are often only of use to one side or the other so many cards don't do anything other than prevent the other player from using them - plus you can't exchange them.  Need to have some tolerance for chaos or you won't enjoy this game.  

The short game is not very interesting.  The standard game allows more time to take advantage of maneuvering your units, reinforcements, and regrouping.

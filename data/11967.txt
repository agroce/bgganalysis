Terrific game.  Sometimes, with all the rush to find the latest thing, we forget what got us here to this point in the hobby.  Simple, but not simplistic, this game is one of the top games of 2004

A marvelous game that demonstrates how some designers don't know when to quit; instead, they keep improving and expanding their creative ideas.

With aggressive play and a bit of luck for such things as the initiative die rolls, the Austrian player has genuine chances to win.  Austrian commanders like Hiller will drive you to distraction.  Watch out for the ever-dangerous Davout and his III Corps; it packs quite a wallop.  If you set up the game on April 16, 1809, you have information not available to Archduke Charles about the location of the French units.  Try beginning from April 19th and see the possibilities.

Well, it took an arm (the left) and a leg (the right, in order to have some sort of attractive symmetrical [or is it asymmetrical?] pattern), but I found and purchased a copy of James R. Arnold's "Crisis on the Danube."  This is probably THE best book on the first part of the Austrian Campaign of 1809 (think OSG's "Seven Days of 1809").

After a quick read (a re-reading will be necessary), I've come away with the feeling that the Austrians may be too strong in the OSG versions of the game.  Hard to believe, I know, given how the outcome seems a forgone conclusion in this campaign.  

The "problem," if that is the correct term, is not in the unit strengths, but in the commanders' abilities, particularly their individual initiatives.  Arnold's book left me with the impression that the average Austrian soldier fought hard and fought well.  The seeds of defeat lie in the command structure.  Arnold holds no punches when it comes to pointing out the tactical misques of the Austrian generals; good men were badly led.  Even my hero, the Archduke Karl/Charles does not escape criticism.  Arnold raises doubt about Charles' epilepsy (quoting a letter from Rothenberg in a footnote, but this "proof" is weak, because there is no first-hand supporting evidence).  

It all proves most interesting and good food for thought.  When I play particular campaigns, I always try to read good literature to go with the game.  Given the scarcity of both good books and the funds to acquire them, this is a challenge in and of itself.

I don't dig this system at all. There's a fair few supply and demoralisation rules that amount to almost no effect if you use your key commanders well. Who needs bullets and fresh horses if your officer has good initiative! Ultimately the game felt a bit direction-less with lots of unused chrome. Rather than being a great game of manoeuvre it devolved into gamey tactics of trying to use retreats to advance and get zoc positioning to actually achieve a result. Not historically convincing or particularly interesting. In its defence, the game does work and it does give the players free reign on how to approach the campaign. Nice map too.

First thoughts:
Rules are more difficult than expected (it's my first Zucker game, though).
The separate terrain reference sheet is erroneous (1 MP for crossing streams - I did not check for additional errors), the one in the rule booklet itself is correct. 
I would have preferred the information side of the counters being printed on the "nice", glossy side of the countersheet, not on the back side.

6DoG System. Interesting Campaign.  Great game balance. Exceedingly playable. Great art work and presentation. I want to love this one, but the CRT just won't let me. It has become like a mustache on the Mona Lisa for me.

RATING: 9
Another game in the Days Series, even better than The 6 Days of Glory!

Quite beautiful map, visible hex numbers. Nice counters, with leader portraits, as I like it. Too few "out of command" markers in the countersheet.

Rules are a bit unclear in certain aspects but overall they’re easy to manage. The combat table is manifold, unlike the old Zucker ones. Optional shock table adds relevance to initiative during combats, too.

Historically reliable concerning general manoeuvres and decisions: sometimes you’ll find yourself doing what leaders really did. Even Charles seizure is taken into account! When it comes to activations, the fact some corps activations depend exclusively on die rolls won’t be enjoyed by some players. I can stand it, but it’s frustrating to see the poor Kolovrat in statue mode along several turns because the die didn’t show a 1 or 2... 

Victory conditions significantly improved, compared with The 6 Days of Glory, spanning combat losses, control of supply sources and Danube bridges, escaping units and demoralization of enemy corps. No auto-victory this time. Austrians have a tough time trying to win, since the French have really powerful troops and their command&control is far better. Anyway, Charles’ lads have their options. The situation is tense and exciting, moreover the varied scoring makes it hard to plan and calculate. Scenarios are interesting but the campaign is the highlight of the game.

Great scale to oversee Napoleon's operational & strategic maneuvering, which was his greatest strength.

RATING: 3
It's Napoleon's Last Battles and Napoleon at Leipzig done to excess. My main objection to it is the Fog of War rules mandating upside down counters; so now you're an Austrian trying to remember where your commanders are, trying to figure out their command trace, who's out of command, which individual units can move, while the French, with a better army and generalship gradually work their way around you and munch you. Overly cumbersome for me. Beautiful map and counters; I'll give it that.

RATING: 9
This was my first Kevin Zucker game and I am impressed. The rules are clean and do a good job simulating Napoleonic operational warfare. I think I'd give it a 10 if I was more interested in this particular campaign, which means I can't wait to play Zucker's other Napoleonic games. The components are very good. Situation favors the French (which it should) but the Austrians certainly have a chance at foiling Bonaparte's plans.

This is an excellent game, and I wish there were more like it in Zucker's inventory.  I've played this game many more times than the Last Success -- it's a very enjoyable game design that works really well at depicting the middling ground between VGs 1809 and Last Success.  I love the semi-tactical feel despite the operational-level depiction; overall it probably the best game on the early battles of 1809 on the market.  Let's hope Kevin delivers more at this very approachable level.

RATING: 8
Good: Operational - Napoleonic - Easy / Medium

Plus:
-Great Balance 
-Great scenario's
-Only one countersheet so very low counter density
-Very nice components
-Very evocative

Minus:
-Constant counter flipping
-Vedette rules are somewhat complicating the game. I like the rules in the coming storm better.

Due to the fog of war in this one: ensure you have some stands where you can put the counters in otherwise you will keep flipping the counters to see which leader and corps was where. Blocks would work here :-)

This is a good game, the system is very easy to learn and play and it gives and excellent inside in the manoeuvring of Napoleonic warfare. The situation is tense and balanced with both sides having oportunities to win. With only one map and one countersheet this is just a game you can put on the table for a long evening of napoleonic fun. Well done!!

I'm exploring the OSG system for the first time with this game.

Fog of war and limited command & control seem perfect for this scale and period, and also help to generate lots of uncertainty and tension for both sides.

It seems truly promising so far.

I am biased. I was involved with play-test and heavily involved in the rules editing. However, I do think that this one the best Napoleonic games at this scale that one can buy. The game itself has a very nice look to it.  OSG and Kevin Zucker are the tops when it comes to Napoleonic wargames.

OSG has been all the way developing only Napoleonic games at operational level.  The simulation skills have been honed and amazingly, yield very realsitic and historical results.  No better place to be here to enjoy what's going on during the Napoleonic era at brigade/ Corp level.  We played the battle of Abensberg and found it an enjoyable experience.  Napoleon is on the rush to resuce the situation along the river Danube as the Austrians thursted through the French defense and cross the river to the north side.  However, there is really an inadequate no. of "in-" and "out-of-command" markers for checking the force status, whether the force is in command by the Army Commander or Officer or not.  The inverted counters, though convey a strong sense of fog-of-war, posed some inconvinient problem for constant checking of the forces, finding the correct leaders for command points allocation, unless you have a pretty good memory. Very nice box cover and overall packaging. (No dice is provided in the game though.) The "Wargame Design" magazine comes within the game is an excellent piece of works.  Read the designer's Design Notes on this game.  It is very informative for play.

The Seven Days of 1809 is good game and a solid simulation. The game is exciting and well balanced. Moreover, it's easy to learn. Unfortunately the game comes with too few out of command counters. I took a bunch of red wooden cubes from one of my eurogames and used them. They worked fine! The fog of war can be hard to handle. Players keep turning their counters over and over again. Blocks would work here. These are minor complaints. This is an impressive game!

A good game with a tried and tested system so it is nice and clean. The system is relatively simple so it is easy to grasp but rather tricky to master. The situation should be fairly well balanced but our game ended with a crushing defeat for the Austrians. Perhaps it was the players fault!

Superb map and counters. Rules are very well written and hold little grey areas for interpretation. The historical and teaching aspects are very well developed, you just have to move the armies according to the march tables day after day to see how things unfolded.
The 8 rating is for a quite entertaining solo experience but that kills the seemingly excellent FOW system. I can't wait to play it with a friend.

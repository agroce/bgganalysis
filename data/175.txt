This is a great little card bluffing game. The strategies are subtle. Memory is an important asset here. It isn't "all luck" as some might think. If you develop a playing pattern (like bad players sometimes do in a Poker game) you'll be hammered. And personally, I think Winning Moves made the classiest edition.

RATING: 3
Just a simple guessing game.  You bid on tiles with points -5 to 10 (excluding 0), using cards with values of 1 to 15 in your hand.  When all tiles have been bid for the game is over.  Like I said - a pure guessing game with out any meat whatsoever.  No real tactics or strategy.

I really like the simplicity of this one.  Plenty of tension and second guessing.  And fast enough to play again right away.

[initial rating: 8] Finally played a few games of this recently (it had easily been two years since) and wow, it didn't hold up for me at all.  It feels a little dated now, and almost too streamlined.  Not that it doesn't still work or anything, but these days, I'd much rather play High Society or For Sale or any other second-guessing game with a bit more "something" there.

Owned as Hol's der Greier.  Disappointing and fairly pointless.  Same numbered cards cancel so very random and light.  Any remaining fun, which can only derive from trying to guess what your opponents will play, can be eliminated completely if your opponents play randomly (which is very tempting in this game).

Raj is the game that lies at the core of so many other games. each player has a set of   that is the same as all other players, and you have to use them more efficiently, outguessing your opponents on every turn.

Raj can be seen in games like Niagara, For Sale, Caribbean, etc., but here it is boiled down to its most pure, fast-playing, essence. 

Great fun, and the lack of extraneous accoutrements keeps it fast, replayable, and throughly enjoyable.

Raj is a game that I hold onto because other people in my gaming circles enjoy it. I think it is merely ok. It is rather funny when multiple people play the same high card (which cancels) and the one who played a 1 or 2 gets the high valued tile. Silly fun and great for non or casual gamers.

RATING: 3
If you hang around keen gamers you will inevitably be challenged to a game of Puerto Rico at some point. Likewise, if some of these gamers have a card-playing background, dreading approaching retirement because it will end their happy game-time lunch breaks and are thus well familiar with any iconic "filler" that has been around since the mid 70s, then it's only matter of time before this gets suggested as a quickie-whilst-we-are-waiting-one. I was long overdue a game of this.

p: I am not a big fan of card games in general, but I had heard good things about "HdG" and knew at least one of us was keen. I actually owned a copy, and we had 15 minutes, so "bring it on"!

Not much later I wondered if I had just played a clever mechanic, rather then a clever game. Surely that wasn't it?!

The strange thing, normally I love games that involve a healthy dose of headology. "Heimlich&Co" still sits very high on my favourite game pile, and for most of the card games I do like, it is exactly the sussing-out of your fellow players that attracts me.

Ironically, the player who normally dislikes the games that rely more on players behaviour, and thus have too much chaos for his liking, actually enjoyed this one. A weird case of role-reversal.

And why did I feel like I was trying to outguess people playing "Snap"?

I have wondered why, and I guess it is down to degrees. When a game has an element of psyching-out your opposition then it becomes something that you can use to build a strategy around. I'm actually quite a closet-fan of those. But when it simply becomes ALL second-guessing, especially within the parameters on offer here, then it is pretty close to just chaos, and I am convinced that completely random play in this game is a indeed a viable winning strategy.

I might do "the experiment" one day, but when 4 people are building a strategy on second-and-triple-guessing each other, and there is only a limited range of 15 cards, there must be more of an illusion of control than one that people can actually obtain. Off course a winner will feel it was clever group observation that made him walk away with the top price. But based on what?

If you can actually deduce that your 3 will be the winning card because 2 other players will see their 14's cancelled, than I take my words back. And advice you to join a more interesting group. If you can't, then winning this game is mostly coincidental.

It's not like "Liar's Dice". Even though it also has a diminishing number of dice, EVERY dice in play can be 1-6 and headology is simply the extra (profoundly entertaining) element bolted onto basic statistics. Here the endgame is the almost-logical conclusion of a random start. I seriously want a lot more from a game.   

I am not saying you can't have a good time playing this, many people do. I don't. I solidly place this game amongst "Snap" and "Snakes and Ladders", other mechanics-rather-than-games that spring to mind. More a filler-passtime for families with kids than a filler game. Or an interesting mechanic that can be, and has been, used in other games.

For a family with younger kids I would rate this substantially higher: a 7 or 8!

The "tournament variation" is where this game is at. Played to a set number of points, with an escalating bonus for each round's winner, this is a FANTASTIC game.  My rating is up a point to reflect this.

As others have said, the mechanic is a pared-down thing of beauty, the psychological element of discerning others' play styles is the key to winning (after you determine the basic values of the tiles so you can bid reasonably; but like Modern Art, one or two players who don't know the values of things can initially screw it up for the others), and the thrill of making that "inspired guess" comes with very, very little investment in time. This is currently making the rounds of our pretty sophisticated adult game group, where it has captivated a number of players who are comfortable playing brain-burners as well. It's receiving a fair number of plays there. I'll play this one any time, anywhere, at the drop of a hat. Hard to find, but easy to make, if you can find a source of 5 suits of cards with 15 values per suit, and you can make up 15 tiles, with values 1-10 and minus 1 to minus 5.

With more than two this is a rather quick wild game of trying to outguess the others and timing when to use your big cards. There are also opportunities for collusion and deception. Remembering what cards others have played helps.

However, considering the game is really just a variant of GOPS, a public domain game playable with a regular deck of cards, I think I'll simply stick to playing GOPS.

Raj is an ok filler which is as easy to play and explain as No Thanks and more simple than For Sale. It’s sort of a blind bidding game, and I’m no fan of this mechanism as I think it has way too much luck. Yes, I know you should think “I know that he knows that I know, so I will do THIS instead”, but it just doesn’t work that way. It’s much worse and more boring than fillers like No Thanks, and where No Thanks works well with 3, Raj is probably best with 5 (4 players was fine too). The only good thing about the game is the moment when you flip over the 9 or 10, and everybody knows that you can win it with your highest card, your 15, but the trick is that if another player plays a 15, none of you will get the card and it will instead go to the next player who might have played a 1! This means that people sometimes play a 14, but so does another player, and then they are screwed… That’s always fun, but it doesn’t prevent the game from being rather uninspiring.

A bare minimum version of something akin to For Sale. I really like it a lot. There's meta-game and bluffing involved. Several ways to approach each round. The players make this game. You could easily kill an entire evening playing this with friends, family, or card nuts.

Probably the simplest card game I have ever played. It's easy to teach, easy to learn and it doesn't offer many options, so it's pretty straightforward. 

I use it almost always to introduce new people to the hobby. When they think they get it, then the tie rule, a nice touch by the way, comes up and then it cracks people up. Normally everyone I have played this game with has liked it, but it's not something to be playing all the time or you will end up hating it. After three rounds of this it's probably time to change to something up a notch. The artwork of my version (mice and vultures) is not that great, though cute.

Alex Randolph's Raj is a masterpiece of simplicity, so much so it's approaching perfection in that respect. I've yet to determine how much skill there is involved in winning, but you definitely see players win more than their share, and I attribute that to some inherit skill. If you can play Raj well, I would suspect you understand player interaction at a very visceral level. 

Played this twice and had a great time. I hate to admit it but the games drives For Sale's rating down just because this game does the mechanic from the second half of the game better. 

This game could be made with a rage deck. Otherwise I would buy a copy if I were you. This game could be a laughing, light game or a tense psychological one depending on your preferences.

I got this simple card game in a Math Trade and was very pleasantly surprised.  It’s basically a stripped down pre-cursor to For Sale, in which players do blind-bidding to acquire or avoid acquiring various cards worth different points, one card at a time.   It’s a great little filler that plays even quicker than For Sale and for fans of blind-bidding, you can’t get much simpler or purer than this.

RATING: 6.75
Raj/Hol's der Geier is a bare-bones simple card game, which has been leveraged by several other designers.

Each player has an identical set of cards with which to bid for point cards, if it is a penalty card, lowest card takes it, if a positive card the highest.

However, if the same card is played by more than one player, then they cancel each other out, and the next wins the card.

If by chance no one wins a card, it stays in the center un-won, and is combined with the next card as a mixed pot.

The winner has the most (positive) points at the end of play. Who will bid most effectively?

For a deceptively simple game, there are some variants which improve it, and a smaller number of players (e.g., two) will minimize the randomness of larger groups.

I liked it, and saw several games which utilize a similar mechanism, e.g., Land Unter, For Sale.

This may not get a ton of play unless I find a variant I love, but it's a solid idea, presented well.

Nice, portable bidding game. Basically cards and tokens.

 I'd seen this one at a local Pic'n Save years ago, but could not decide to get it since I knew nothing about it.
I looked up Raj on the Geek and it had good reviews!
I went back to Pic'n Save (now a Big Lots,) and was able to find the game still there! The box was beat up and taped up, but I purchased it for $3.00. 

We played it and the 3 year old beat us by playing his cards in order, from 15 down to 1, since he didn't shuffle them.

We liked this one quite a bit.

The blind bidding mechanism reduced to its logical minimum, and possibly the right length for this type of game. This is purely about outguessing your opponents and the extent to which you can do that depends on how regularly your group plays. A table of strangers reduces this to pure chaos. It's an amusing way to spend 5 minutes, but for randomly assembled groups For Sale is better.

Bluffing Simultaneous Action Selection 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
First played May 7th, 2008. Taught in a few minutes, played in 15min with 4 players. This is a mostly luck based game, however there is a little bit of strategy. Each player has 15 cards 1-15 and secretly choose them during 15 rounds. There is a master deck ranked 10 through minus 5 without a zero. The master deck is shuffled and one card turned over for each round. Players bid on capturing that card. For positive cards, the highest non-tied card wins(if two 15's are played the the next highest card wins). If the card in negative, the lowest card wins the trick. Sum all of the cards and the most points wins. This is interesting and could be played with a modified regular deck if you wanted to make it work that way. It's worth a game play if you know someone who has it, otherwise try making your own deck to play.

Ideal Players: 4-5

Description: Each player starts with a fixed set of cards. Players use these cards to bid on treasures randomly drawn from a bag. The treasure goes to the highest unique bidder. If two players tie, the next highest wins!

Pro: Simple and easy to explain. Neat mechanic of drawing treasures from a bag. Psychological depth in predicting other players. Strategy in remembering which cards have been played. Unique bidding mechanic often rewards second-highest bidder. Psychological dynamic lends itself to replayability.

Con: Theme pasted on mechanics.

Almost seems solvable in a way, where the true value of each tile should become apparent after a few games, but of course this will never be true because unless people “see it” exactly the same, those values will always fluctuate.  (the values are more calculable in the 2 player game)

The 2 player game could be viewed as the most strategic, since you have the most control, but its also not as fun as playing with more, and since it is not a deep game playing with more is optimal I think here, depending on what someone wants of course.  

VERY simple to learn and play, you could play with family on the Holidays and get them hooked so a great gateway filler, or just a late night filler between friends.

I have to give credit to this game for its originality, but I discovered it in reverse, which probably means that I won't play this one that much.

fun. hand management Blind bidding and bluffing ...

scored 32 in a four playergame Total value of positive cards is 55. and the negative is -15

I had 5,6,7,8,9 and -3 took that one delibaterly and also didn't go for the 10.

edit: rerating in 2017.
up from 6.8. to 7.8

This probably is the best 5 player filler if you have 10 minutes to spare.

Raj is pure, distilled gaming fun.  My first three games (three-player) took all of 20 minutes total.  There is luck, of course, strategy and a bit of tactics... most importantly, you have to get into the minds of your opponents... all that for a half-sheet of rules, and a game one could create using two standard playing card decks!

Wow, an instant hit.  Scales pretty well, but I think I like it best with three.  The tiebreaker rule is what makes it shine.  That and the incredibly corny box art and insert story of the making of the game.

RATING: 6.8
There is not much to this game but it creates tension in every turn other than the last because you're not quite sure what your opponents will throw out there. There were lots of surprised gasps and laughter generated here even though all you're doing is throwing tiles out in hopes of gaining positive scores or avoiding negatives.

Played the German Hol's der Geier version.  But it's all the same.  It's blind bidding and that's it.  The best-practice algorithm seemed pretty obvious to me, so I crushed everyone.

Bidding game where everyone has bid cards 1 to 15. Prizes (positive or negative points) are selected then secretly bid on. If two players selected the same card, thier bids are cancelled.

Light, witty and very nasty card game, ideal to play while travelling or to end a gaming session. It's got a healthy portion of psychology (luck? Not really...), but it doesn't complicate things when it's not needed (see Octrix as a counterexample). Of course it never gets played only once - it's extremely addictive and it always brings a good amount of laughs when played.

(Alex Randolph has got quite a knack for these, innit? A couple of twitches on Gops and you have something fifty times meaner).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
One of the quickest, and mindless, fillers about. Start with identical hands (1-15). There are 15 cards to win (valued -5 to 10) and 15 simultaneous revelation plays, highest played wins each score card. It's only ever brought out when we expect someone imminently before we start a proper game; the reason being the rules explanation is 30 seconds and the game several minutes. Within those minutes is a game of guess and double-guess - play low and hope the players above you tie and a good card falls to you, or play high and hope you stand alone. Some fun while it lasts.

You'd rather play e.g. For Sale! than this. A simple use-once bidding mechanic isn't really enough to make a game.

The fun base mechanic has inspired many a game design, as there is the frequent sitcom of same bids giving the spoils to others as well as big blowouts on bidding. Card counting really helps but the rewards are positive or negative numbers and so for me the fractured score is less exciting than the tracked status in designs such as the intriguing Adel or the wonderful Montgolfiere.

(Hols der Geier) Fast, funny filler.
Bid for victory point cards, highest bid wins. Bid to avoid minus point cards, lowest bid takes the card. Two or more players bid the same then it goes to the next highest (or lowest). Each of your cards, numbered 1-15, can only be used once. Good luck trying to remember who's played what! :-)

Works as a filler, I guess, but I can't see wanting to play for more than 5-10 minutes.  Reminds me of Rock-Paper-Scissors - except you're only allowed to pick each one once.

This is extremely simple. Everybody is dealt 15 cards from 1 to 15. Then 15 cards (from -5 to 10) are blind auctioned with high card winning the positive cards and low card getting the negative cards. The card won are calculated at the end. The twist is that if some players bid the same number the next biggest number wins. Very light, quite random and a lot of fun.

RATING: 7
Decent light card game about trying to balance how high a card you want to play against how high you think other players will go. 

The same thing has been done better since, by Asterix: The Card Game/Kartenspiel. If you'r going to play one or the other, go for Asterix.

RATING: 8
Very simple bidding game. Everyone has the same cards 1-15 and blind bids for tile -5 to +10.  Highest card wins the positive numbers and lowest card wins the negative numbers.  Ties knock each other out leaving it for the next highest number (or lowest in the case of negatives).

The meta-game is the strength of this game, but if you don't like that sort of thing it's over in less than 15 minutes (if you have slow players).

Raj -- Truly elegant.  The negative number tiles add the dimension which makes this game memorable.

RATING: 4
A barebones game of simultaneous action selection. Players bid blindly for a prize every round, with the highest played card winning the prize – but only if the prize has a positive value. In the case of the prize having a negative value, then the lowest played card wins it. The twist is that played cards of identical values cancel each other out, leading to some very unpredictable outcomes.

As players begin with identical hands, there is a little psychology and deduction involved in outguessing your opponents. It’s still incredibly lightweight though, and I’d personally prefer to play several other games which have adapted the archetype laid out here. ([thing=30539][/thing] for the visual appeal; [thing=156180][/thing] for a little more substance.)

It's such a perfect little game.  It's no wonder it was stolen from so much.  The problem is that it is kind of dumb, so while it is fun to play Raj, when people try to use this game as a vehicle for the rest of the design the blind bidding seems burdensome and random.  Well, the game is over in 5 minutes.  There are tons of hoots and hollers and then it is done.  So the chaos fits the effort and the results are entertaining.

Awesome filler. Even kids are competitive.

I've played the Stupide Vautour version of this -- love the artwork, love the game, would never turn down the chance to play.  Especially given that you can play a few games so quickly!  My only dissapointment is the cost of the Vautour version of the game... way too pricey for what you're getting.  Still, there are few things I enjoy hearing more than a bested opponent crying out, "STUPID VULTURE!!!"

I'm kind of shocked by the low ratings as I've introduced many people to this game and everyone has enjoyed it.  Maybe I tend to favor games that strip mechanisms down to their barest elements, such as For Sale, as the description states.

[Ravensburger 'Hol's der Geier' 1999 edition] {simultaneous-action, bidding; optimal 5p} Raj is a small and cute blind-bidding game. It's blind bidding in its pure form. It's easy to teach and learn in 2 minutes. Raj is very fun and interactive. Players are often yelling when they found that their cards are cancelled or they pick a bargain because all other cards are cancelled. A typical game lasts around 20-30 minutes, depending on the target score. I usually lose in this game but it gives me great fun. Recommended for a family, kids and students!

The treasure cards are cute. However, the number cards are too plain. I wish there are interesting mice on the cards.

Part of how I rate games is based on how much enjoyment a game gives for the time invested in it. I also appreciate no-frills designs that are elegant in their simplicity (Medici is one such design I like - a fine-tuned game engine that purrs and little else). Hol's der Geier/Raj takes only five minutes to play and delivers every time. A streamlined, quick, near-perfect filler game that has stood the test of time extremely well.

Lot's of laughs and groan as players try to out-guess each other, and still play the same high (or low for negatives) cards. I love that I can get this out and teach it to four newbies and complete a hand in under 10 minutes.

This is supposedly the first game that used the simultaneous selection mechanism. It's one of those games that's best with more players. I wonder if a sixth player would still be fun. All you'd need is another set of cards 1-15.

I was surprised how much I liked this. The rules are ridiculously simple, and I feel like I could play this with practically anyone.

I love this game! 2 minutes to teach, and lots of sweet tension with every tile. The game play is simplicity itself: this is the Basari, or Hoity Toity mechanism distelled to its most simplified essence.  And like those simultanious action selection games, it leads to a wonderful little excersize in double think. But with nothing added to the game beyond the stripped down mechanic itself, I actually find it more fun.  Plays quick and everyone always wants to play again. I have now played with 2, 3 and 4 and it plays differently with each. I think I enjoyed 3 best, because the 2-way tie possibility ups the drama (how it hurts to let someone get the 9 or 10 tile with a 1 card because 2 people played the 15!) The game feels so strategic which is not a thing often heard about a 10 minute game. Fun per minute ratio on this one is about as high as it gets.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is a classic. Clear but never transparent. The scoring tiles put a nice twist in the inevitable card counting that goes on. Seems to me that the less players the more uncertain things can be. Perfect for three players. A must for trick taking card fans. Appeals to the gamer as much as the casual player.

Back when I was first finding about designer boardgames I read the rules for this game somewhere.  At the next family reunion, I improvised the game with a regular deck of cards and dominos.  We then proceeded to have a wonderful time with the game.  I'm very happy to finally acquiring a copy of it.

Hace tiempo cuando estaba encontrando por primera vez los juegos de mesa "europeos" leí en algún lado la reglas de este juego.  En la próxima reunión familiar, improvisé este juego con cartas comunes y corrientes y fichas de dominó.  Hecho esto, pasamos una magnífica velada con este juego.  Estoy muy contento de adquirir por fin una copia del juego.

Only played the 2-player variant.  It's one of the purest auction games possible, and either something you'll love or hate, depending on how you feel about auctions in general.  The thing that seperates this from most auction games is that it isn't about analyzing the utility of something, it's more about reading your opponent.  It feels more like LOTR: The Confrontation than Modern Art or Medici.

Particularly fun if you don't take turns: FREE FOR ALL!!! AAAGH!

Note: unless playing on carpet, consider restricting ballista use, as they are too powerful otherwise.  We require all walls to be knocked down before allowing Ballistas for "flag sniping".

The bits are scattered in a hundred boxes.  Nothing's quite like firing a carom into your opponent's castle and shattering it.  You have to be pretty hard-hearted not to enjoy that kind of destruction.  I put the Viking stickers on the blue caroms because I liked them better.  I now see the error of my ways.

RATING: 4
This is not really a game, it is controlled destruction.  Probably a good thing for little boys.  But how long will it be played with before local wildlife is shot?  Play balance is poor- the crossbows are much easier to aim.  But the catapults are more fun so maybe it does balance out.

No box. I bought the pieces from Jason Sparenberg (RIP) in seventh grade for $5.00 along with two boxes of lead Grenadier Advanced Dungeons and Dragons miniatures. Of course, my memory may be off about how much I spent or whether this was a single transaction or happened over multiple years. I do remember setting up Crossbows and Catapults battles with Johnster on the front porch of the house I grew up in, and we probably wouldn't admit we were older than seventh grade.

RATING: 5
20+ plays as a kid.  This was one of my favorite games in my youth, even though the catapults were pretty lazy and the crossbows often just knocked pieces back (instead of busting them open) on our tile floor.  Usually we stopped playing by the rules and started slamming Dukes of Hazard cars into the structures... but this game fits almost every little boy's dream of shooting things and causing destruction.  If rated as a kids game, it's probably a 7 out of 10.

The only 10 in my 600+ game collection. This game brought me hours, upon hours, of endless joy as a teen. Often times I had no one to play with and yet I fought the battle on both sides , sending projectiles in all direction. Men rise and men fall, buildings rise and buildings fall. I loved hitting those long catapult shots causing massive destruction. The Nostalgia of C&C will live on forever. I still dream of the day where I find a sealed copy of the 1983 version.

This is worth a few grins every time we pull it off the shelf.

An Ameritrash equivalent of [gameid=521].  Seriously, shooting disks to try and knock out your foe, but with platic bits and a pasted on fantasy theme.

I was walking through a local thrift store and I saw this game. I totally forgot about it, but I had it when I was a kid so I decided to purchase it for nostalgia. There really isn't much challenge to the game, but it is kinda fun getting into the theme and demolishing your opponent's castle. Definitely a kid's only game though.

I suppose this would be considered a retro-rating.  We used to really love this game.  We'd set it up waaay further than the rules would suggest and have at it.  Sometimes we'd even setup in the hallways for a ricochet effect.  It's good fun blowing stuff up.  We're older now, and getting on the floor isn't as easy as it used to be.  Strategy over skill shots now. *sigh*

This one brings back so many memories from being a kid (rank this one a 10 for any child aged 10 and under).  We had a duct-taped playing field on my smooth basement floor where numerous battles took place.  Still have most of the pieces (along with the expansion battering ram and catapult towers), though the original crossbows broke long ago under the weight of doubled up rubber bands for powerful blasts.

I have two copies of this game: the original 1983 Lakeside release and the 1991 TOMY reissue. My kids and I revisit this game on occasion (though I always end of picking up the pieces for weeks afterward). I have convinced some of my more 'mature' gaming friends to play a session or two, but it can be a hard sell. Not sure why someone who is willing to dump 100s of $ into WHFB, WH40K, WarZone, etc. can't abide the idea of Crossbows & Catapults.

30+ years later, I still have this game in my collection.  Of all my childhood games, this would be one of the most difficult to part with.  The rules aren't particularly good (the updated Battleground version is much better) but the components are very sturdy and look great.  The rulebook also suggests kids choose from a variety of optional rules, or just make their own, which is a great way to get kids thinking about game design.  

Just make sure you have plenty of replacement rubber bands on hand!

**Nostalgia rating**

Did you ever like just smashing through a house of cards or a block tower?

If so, this game is perfect for you. Rubberband powered flying ballast, exploding fortifications, and some intentionally aimed shots at your buddy (target flags be damned!)....

A young boy's game for sure, but a beer or two and a late night never hurt! A well placed buddy shot can though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This game is more about destruction than anything else.  Here's a hint: DON'T double wrap rubber bands on the catapults for extra power... (snap!) Same goes for the crossbows (only have 1 of each left)

An excellent battle/dexterity type game. I expected nothing more than a simple toy bash (ala Attacktix), but there's actually a little more depth to the game. Soldiers need to man the weapons, flags provide morale boosts and you need to know when to use the special fire oil and boulders.

Basically a streamlined version of setting up your army men and shooting rubber bands at them to knock them over.  Each side sets up their men and castle walls with blocks that loosely fit together.  You then use little crossbows and catapults to fling heavy plastic discs at your opponents arrangement and you try to knock everything over.  Fun as a toy almost more than anything.  I wish I still had this for nostalgia reasons.  :-)

I love the pieces of this game and the idea of actually making a game with rules about flinging projectiles at plastic army men.  The problem is that the rules are really really vague and uninteresting.  The bits are nice, though, and I would play again.  I gifted the copy I thrifted with the trojan horse/battering ram to the 6-year-old son of a friend of mine.  He loves it and just sets it up for fun, so I hear.

This game is just wacky fun. Players construct forts out of bricks on top of a playing mat, on which an icon is printed. They will then use rubber band-powered crossbows and catapults to fire heavy plastic disks at the other player's fort. The goal is to land a disk on the other player's playmat before they manage to do the same.

One of my favorite games as a kid, and still fun today.

Full of nostalgic yummy goodness. With all the expansions and a double set I can't think of anything else worth spending time sprawled out on the basement floor. It's similar to setting up action figures and throwing rocks to knock them down, but with rules.

I played this children's game quite a bit back in the day.

Everyone loves Crossbows & Catapults. My plastic catapults and crossbows are slowly wearing and falling apart from years of play. I bought the new version for my younger cousin but didn't like how the new blocks were shaped (they limit the ways you can build walls). Almost every game I've played has devolved from a turn based battle into a wild free for all. :)

own lakeside basic version and tomy grand battle set.  I played this to death as a kid.  We would setup the sets on two 4x6 sheets of plywood.  We would put masking tape along our provincial boundaries and made up lots of neat rules.  I can't wait till my son gets a bit older.  For some reason the blocks seem way smaller than they used to... :p

I had this when I was a kid. I completely forgot about this game until I stumbled on it this evening. Suddenly I remember playing it alone over and over (playing both sides). I also remember playing once with my dad and thinking it was the best thing ever.

Had this one as a kid. The components are great, but the gameplay as a game was a little dry -- it almost always devolved into an all-out slugfest with the crossbows, ignoring turns or rules or anything.

Rated nostalgically as a 9 year old kid, I'd give it an 8+.  Today, it's a 4.  Averaged to a 6.

I played this one to no end.  The homebrew rules we'd come up with added so much variety - as did the amount of candy we would bet on each game.  Great destructive fun - at the time.

I loved this game as a kid and it was really my first touch of the gaming bug. Too bad I was an irresponcible 7 year old and lost or broke the whole thing. Really tempted to by an Ebayed copy to play with my son now.

I love this game just because of the nostalgia.  This game is not really a board game and takes up the whole floor.  Players take sides of barbarians or orcs and use catapults and crossbows to launch discs at each other's castles and capture other players disks. A player must land 5 disks on the other players player board after knocking down their castle in order to win or land on the treasure spot underneath the demolished castle.

Pros: skill game,fun to cause destruction. Competitive gameplay

Cons:huge gameplay area, no real heavy thinking,all skill, basic gameplay

Another game that was fun as a kid.  Building things up then smashing them down.  Sooooo much fun in fact.  Especially putting on three times as many elastic bands as required to really get those discs moving.

Couldn't see myself getting enthralled for hours with it nowadays, but if you're a boy in the 7-13yo bracket, this'll do nicely.

RATING: 6
Played a lot as a kid.  Never played by the right rules.  Setup mat and played that everything must be knocked 100% off mat.  Played on carpet, so only used catapults.  Lots of extras - castle outposts, battering ram, dragon, trojan horse.  Just missed the giants.  I look forward to playing this with my kids. Rating is 5 as adult game, but 8 as a kid game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I had a lot fo fun with this game, just playing with my brother.  Strangely enough the game balance depends on one thing and one thing alone.  Quality of your rubber bands.  Both the catapult and the crossbow (and the expansions) used rubber bands.  There was quite an arms race around our household scavenging for the best rubber bands with which to equip our armies.  Great fun :)

I had the Trojan horse expansion for the game, and while the horse worked well, the beast shield that the barbarians got was rather lacking.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
My brother had a set of this back in the day.  It was really more of a toy than a game.  While we played the actual game by the rules a few times it was much more likely that we were just building castles to take pot shots at.  Of course, GI Joe, Star Wars figures, and Legos were also often targets of our Medieval wrath.  Loads of fun.  [08/14/2007]

RATING: 7.5
You'll need lots of linoleum flooring to play Crossbows, but assuming you do you will have a blast smashing down your opponents castle walls. I hadn't played this since my childhood until my own kids asked to try it. Replaced a few rubber bands and we were having great fun together just like I did with my cousins all those years before.

A fun toy/game from my childhood.  In the early 2000s I found a copy of the updated version and played that some with my kids.  Building up your defenses and then firing the disks at the other player was a lot of fun but it often took more space than we could easily maintain so game time was limited.

RATING: 7
it was fun enough, but way overpriced for dressed up Yahtzee.

Particularly annoying that for £40 you don't even get a set of dice per player, so on your turn you're obliged to scavenge the dice you need from around the table.

For me to buy this it would have to be £25 with 4 sets of dice.

Something different from what I'm used to... It's good for some moments of pure fun and entertainment without all the heavy thinking I love in my games! 

Dice throwing, lots of randomness, but you really can mitigate that with the scarabs tokens!

LIKE: Lots of dice! It didn't take as long as I thought with 4 players. I liked the scarcity of items. The game feels well designed, good options each turn. Plenty of variety in the game setup.
DISLIKE: Not very interactive. Some downtime, but fairly minimal. The box is large and over-produced. This game could have been half the size. Takes a little time to set up.

OVERALL: Great dice game. Luck dependent, but you realize that going in. Get the things that change the pips. That is the key.

*Rating based on one play.

Favor of the Pharaoh is not my style of game.  It is a dice-chucking, Yahtzee-style, push-your-luck race game with a bit of tableau building.

My main complaint about this game is a complaint I have about many dice games: you can't plan your turn ahead of time, which means you have nothing to think about during your opponents' turns.  This makes the down time intolerable, especially with 4.  Turns in this game can take quite a while as the game moves forward and players have lots of ways of manipulating their dice.  It can quickly become a source of analysis paralysis (AP) for players, which drags out the play time.

Another issue I have with this game is that some of the special abilities you can gain are too complex for a game of this weight, while others are very vanilla and are only marginally different.  The game does come with a wide variety of special abilities you can choose from to customize the game, so you can possibly suit the game to your tastes. However, in the recommended setup for new players, most of the abilities were only slight variations on each other (gain a die of value 1 versus gain a die of value 5).  Even the different types of dice that come in the game are only slightly different, often varying on only one out of six faces.  Then there are the clear-colored dice that are exactly the same as the standard six-sided dice, but simply can't be rerolled.  These similarities made the game feel very bland.  There were a couple of stand-outs in the new-player setup, but those only served to create further analysis paralysis.

In the end, the decisions in this game don't feel very impactful or interesting.  Flip a die, add one to it, reroll a different one, all with the simple goal of getting seven of a kind.  Whether I got a four of a kind or a three of a kind, the result wasn't much different.  And the theme is so pasted on that the game doesn't feel like anything more than chucking dice and modifying the results.  All in all, it makes for a very bland, boring experience.

2016 10x10. DexEnvoy Certified.

This game is higly addictive. It plays fast and every play starts with the excitement of a race and the tantalizing possibility of all the various tiles staring you in the face. The final roll off seems a bit clunky when reading the rules, but in practice it works quite well and can be quite tense (e.g. in my most recent 2p game, my fiance's 10 5's held up just BARELY as I was unable to reroll using three tokens to get a 10th 6, a stellar finish!)

Setup isn't too bad either, because the insert is actually pretty functional. If you get this at MSRP you might be a little miffed because I am not sure it's a $60 game, but there is a ton of modularity (which to be honest isn't even necessarily needed for replayability, but it has it in spades) and plenty of game here. I have only played 2p but it drew my non-gamer fiance in and I will play this whenever right now.

**3p played much longer. We will see, but it looks like it's best as a 2p game right now.

Favor of the Pharoah scores over To Court the King with its variable selection of characters.  It suffers from Bezier's usual clip-art standard artwork in comparison to Court the King's beautiful cards.  Those two points aside, it's the same Yahtzee variant, with characters bringing additional dice or ways of modifying dice results.

Hmm. I like the mechanics of building your dice pool (by rolling poker hands), but it seemed to have a bit of a steamrolling "rich get richer" type feel. It also played much quicker than I imagined it would, so that's a bonus.

The rating would be higher but, in the end, you're spending the entire game preparing for a roll-off at the end of the game, and that single roll-off decides the entire game - which is a shame.

This re-implementation of To Court The King is a great game even if you've never played its predecessor. You cannot go wrong with rolling all those dice. Bascially you are rolling dice to either get special ability tiles or more dice to roll each round. The object of the game is to roll 7 of a kind, get the Favor of the Pharaoh and to keep it. Whatever you roll your 7 of a kind you lock it. But someone on their following turn can beat you and take the Favor. So you roll 7 threes. If someone can roll 7 fours then they've trumped you. Or should they roll 8 of a kind, the dame thing happens. It is fun, strategic and a good looking game. Give it a try

Good solid dice game here in which you're building up a pool of dice and tiles that can spur you on to winning the Pharaoh's favor. I like that the game comes with a number of tile options and sides so the experience won't ever feel PRECISELY the same, even though most of them are just for meeting certain conditions. As luck-based as a die rolling game might seem, a lot of the tiles and Tokens help mitigate that. Fun.

Big fan of dice games and this is one of if not my all time favorites tied with Pandemic The Cure.  Enjoy the variety offered by the different setups and how the combos you roll each game lead you to gravitate towards different tiles to buy and how this in turns leads to more variety in the powers you have to use.   Also enjoy how the whole game is a race, not only to the finish but for the powers to help get you there.  Rate the game as a 10 for two simple reasons: I find it thrilling to play and after several plays want to play again! I even enjoy simply watching others play.  Knew I loved this game when I could not stop thinking about it before purchasing and lately when not playing.  Fun game to be obsessed about!

Seems quite fun for a dice game. It's fine for a 15 minute filler which you chuck a lot of dice.
It is multi player solitaire. And completely subject to the luck of the dice. If your first 2 rolls are crap and you don't get any abilities, you are done for the whole game.
There is a start player DISADVANTAGE if you roll well, because you are missing scarabs to compensate.

20 minutes to set up. 15 minutes to play. Boo to that return on time investment.

This feels like a decent game let down by economies in the production as there's not enough dice for everyone to have their own to roll each turn, which is particularly annoying given the general excellence of the production otherwise - chunky tiles and a very nice box insert that does a good job separating the various different tiles. The game itself is I suppose a 'dice builder', with you adding more and different dice and ancillary powers (shown on the tiles) each turn in order to be able to make the rolls that let you access more powerful tiles and, eventually, the tile which triggers the game end and a final roll-off to determine the winner, assisted by all the powers you've collected along the way - the winning sequence in our game was seven fives, beaten by seven sixes and the winner ending with eight sixes - though, judging by the pyramid shaped game aid, that's at the low end of final scoring. Pyramids aside, the theming is about as strong as in Dominion but doesn't get in the way (though a prize goes to anyone who can explain why a wooden stand up Pharaoh was included?). Probably worth an extra point on my rating with an adequate supply of dice.

A bit of a glorified Yahtzee, but there can be some interesting decisions that you may have to make.  Very "multiplayer solitaire", as the interaction with others is essentially "I will take this tile so that you cannot".

Eh... it's OK. I've played To Court the King a bit, and enjoy it well enough, so this game felt comfortably familiar.

I'm actually not sure if this is an improvement. I know the various tiles are there for variety, but it just feels more complex for complexities sake. I'm not sure I actually enjoy this version of the game more than its original and more simpler version.

My only play was with four, and that feels like a bit of a drag. My opinion might improve slightly if played with two or three.

Dice, dice, and more dice.  This is sort of like a yahtzee game where you're trying to get of-a-kind rolls and straights, and whatnot.  Instead of three rolls, you get as many as you want, as long as you lock one of the dice just rolled.  These rolls "unlock" new achievements/abilities that can give you additional dice, ability to increase pips, or gain additional abilities.  These abilities are available every turn, once/turn, or once/game.  There are also scarab tokens which can either add one pip to one die or re-roll one die.  The end of the game is triggered once one gains the queen by rolling at least seven of-a-kind dice.  Once that happens the end game is triggered; every other player has one more roll to try and beat the prior roll with one last re-roll for the one triggering the end of the game.

It's important to gain special abilities earlier on in the game as there is only a finite amount available.  I've lost a few games because I had terrible rolls, which is part of the beast of the game.

Favor of the Pharaoh tasks players with building a dice-rolling engine—not to mention adding and manipulating dice—in preparation for a final roll-off between all players to gain the Pharaoh's favor and win the game. Includes more than one hundred tiles, over twenty standard and custom dice, dozens of bonus tokens, level bars, locking pyramids, and more. With so many combinations of level bars and tiles, no two games will ever be set up the same!

Fantastic dice manipulation. Sometimes it suffers from a front-runner problem where it's all too obvious that the leader won't be caught.

If the designer did not include a tile for every possible way to manipulate dice, he came close. You'll add one of those tiles to your arsenal every round, and before long it almost won't matter what numbers you roll; you'll be able, through multiple manipulations, nearly to dictate the numerical combinations you want.

Played at BGGcon 2015. 

You roll dice like Yahtzee, then use them to buy more dice and dice-changing abilities. The idea is to be able to manipulate your dice so that you get seven of a kind (thus gaining the queen's notice). 

There are tons of different ability cards and I liked the dice-pyramid bits.

I think I have missed something with this one, after our game the three other players were quite enthused and discussing various strategies and options. 
I found this to be a rather dull dice roller, select your dice, roll your dice until you are happy/out of options, purchase whatever is the best card that you can afford. Rinse repeat until someone claims the queen.

There is no theme what so ever, and the cardboard pyramids simple get in the way. There is a good selection of cards and so I think there are a lot of setups, but personally I feel regardless of setup this will be the same dull dice roller again and again.

I do not want to play again, but I suspect others in my group will.

Nem hangzik rosszul az alapfelállás: kockapóker jelleggel gyűjtünk lapkákat, amik újabb kockákat esetleg kockavariálási lehetőségeket adnak. Mindezt addig tesszük, amíg valaki össze nem szed 7 vagy 8 egyformát egy dobássorozattal.
Menet közben valahogy mégse volt érdekes a játék. Eleve nem sikerült felfogni, hogy magának a piramisnak mi értelme van, szerintem semmi, de így meg kifejezetten zavaró a megléte. A vége is béna a játéknak, ezzel a körben még mindenki megpróbálja überelni a másik dobását. Előtte se volt túl sok tematika a játékban, de ezzel minden maradványát sikerült kiirtani.

Downtime gets a little fierce and decisions are a little far between. The most interesting decisions tend to revolve around when to stab at acquiring more dice in comparison to more manipulation--which is particularly dependent upon a board setup. It is always appreciated when the best move sometimes is just to take the Herder (the "no combination" tile).
This is probably about as far as a Yahtzee-alike can be expected to go.

I'll need to play this a few more times to make a better judgement. With the initial setup I found it very easy to do what I wanted. Also, there was no final roll-off as I was able to roll 12 of a kind and none of the other 3 players had that many dice.

The variable setup is a must for this game, because I can't see myself deviating from my plan otherwise.

Much more interesting then To Court the King but the end can sneak up on you out of no where. In our game someone bought a one-shot tile that let him take a card and another turn and it was over because none of us could get enough dice to challenge. I do like the tweeking they did with the dice and would definatly recommend it as an improvement over TCtK.

Very, very long setup for its game length. (And no, I shouldn't have to use an app to "speed it up")

Very, very big runaway leader issue.

Very, very oversized box.

Very, very expensive for what it is.

Very, very much suggest you look elsewhere for a fun dice game.

Buying one of the 5$ dice tube games at Target or Walmart will provide more enjoyment.

Yahtzee is more fun and infinitely less expensive.

King of Tokyo (which some in comments has raised as an alternative) is infinitely more thematic and fun.

If you're looking for a colourful, pacy, gateway game and like chucking handfuls of dice 'Yahtzee style' then look no further.  At first this appears like an entirely resistable  luckfest but dip your toe in the water.  Then wade in.  You'll be pleasantly surprised.  It's gently competitive-helping your friends to play well is nearly as satisfying as winning.  There are enough decision points to make you feel as though you've earned the pharaoh's favour (yes,'ou') and I like the end game roll offs. They might even result in spontaneous cheering. The only drawback is the slight inconvenience of set up.  Oh, and give me more custom dice, loads more custom dice.

Favor of the Pharaoh is a Yahtzee inspired dice rolling game. Bringing something new to the table, Favor of the Pharaoh allows players to build somewhat of an engine, gaining dice and abilities as the game progresses. Ultimately the game will end when a player is able to roll 7-of-a-kind. Yahtzee is a great game and Pharaoh does a nice job of taking the game and adds a feel of building up each turn. The progression is fun, but players can easily end the game earlier than others want. This has some good and bad to it. Additionally, set up takes some time for the type of game it is. Favor of the Pharaoh is a good game, but its efforts to deviate from Yahtzee lost some of the dice game's luster.

First games tend to drag on as you are not familiar with the iconography.  However, after that, the turns are fast.  The setup time is longer than I would wish for in a game of that weight.  Of course, a dice-chucker has a lot of luck involved but the blue cards and scarab tokens help to mitigate that aspect.  Games are tight until the end.  They should have included more (smaller) dice to reduce the dice gathering that occurs at the beginning of each player's turn (with 3+ players).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Just a bit crap. You need as many extra dice as possible to build a system... But it builds so fast that unless you get extra dice on turn 1 then you get left behind

A bit dull.

This is a really fun dice-rolling game with a lot of variety. I'm very glad they created an app to randomize the set-up, as I don't really like the idea of rolling the dice just to see what comes out.

Formerly To Court the King. By Tom Lehmann. 2p, 3p or 4p. A dice game with dice manipulation. Similar to racing games, especially Cosmic Run. GameNight video (/video/91949) shows exciting gameplay. Player interaction is limited to taking tiles that other players might want. Some complaints about downtime. It seems that there could be a runaway leader, but I found no such complaints. A setup app is available.

A yahtzee style dice rolling game where you start with three dice and try o make certain roll requirements to gain tiles in order to gain special abilities & additional dice.  Very simple game with limited tactics (and no strategy) where you try to outmaneuver opponents to get tiles so they cannot.  Game is fast, ends when someone can make 7 of a kind (maybe 20-35 minutes).  Variety of tiles & dice requirements gives this some replay but it generally isn't very interesting.

It wasn't painful, but it wasn't that much fun.  There was nothing to do when it wasn't your turn.  There felt to be a danger of a runaway leader since the feedback loop was unfiltered.

Still, it did build to a crescendo on the last turn, which is a good thing with a dice game.

Takes the basic Yahtzee core of roll a bunch of dice, saving some after each roll and adds in some special power tiles as rewards for the lower tier stuff (three of a kind, small straight, etc.) It certainly succeeds at what it's trying to do (be a fun quick dice game) but I'm just not every going to be too excited about such a game.

RATING: 6
Decent push your luck dice game. Played it 3 player and 2 player twice each. Seems like the rich get richer with more players. This is because the easier to roll sets like two pair, 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind, get gobbled up (there are only enough tiles per player -1). If you aren't paying close attention to what other people can do on their next turn, then you can get blocked out quickly. If you can't roll those sets anymore because they are gone, then it is very difficult to catch up as the other players may roll about twice as many dice as you.

The two tokens are handy to amplify your rolls. It's not my favorite out of the available dice games but the end game is fun enough when players have a last gasp to chain together as many of the same die number as possible to outdo each other.

An essentially themeless dice chucker in which you have to quickly build up your dice pool to score 7 of a kind and trigger the final round. 

Mechanically it all seems to work. The game comes with a lot of tokens with which you can build up your dice pool. Only half of them are used in any one game so there is a lot of variability and replayability out of the box. I can see a lot of players having fun playing this and discovering the winning combinations of abilities on these tokens. 

Having said that, this isn't one for me. I have come to the realization that I loath dice rolling. In the end of the day, you still need a ton of luck when playing a game like this. The dice rolling can be mitigated with scarab tokens that let you add a pip to a die roll or reroll the die altogether. I doesn't let you detract a pip though and I sorely missed that ability in this game.

Furthermore, there is no player interaction and downtime can be quite long with a large player count that is AP prone.

So if, like me, dice rolling isn't your thing I would not recommend you play this game. The box art looks gorgeous, but the game inside is as themeless and dry as the sands of Egypt.

Free BGGcon game! A few people got it, and it was decent. I'll be interested to see if Among the Stars fares better since that's what I got instead.

This was a dice scaling game where you turn in dice to get tiles that let you get more dice. I went all in on tiles that gave me more dice while my opponents went the utility routes, and I absolutely crushed them, having 10 dice before either of them had the ability to roll 7, so I won outright.

I'd play this again. I thought it was quick and fun but still had some interesting decisions, particularly when it came to early rolls and which dice to lock in. I probably won't buy it, but it was enjoyable.

I really like this game.  I've just got a few plays with it so far with my family who aren't as practiced as gamers as myself and my friends are, and I think it moves a lot faster than they are wont to give it credit for.  You had better be buying a full-combo improvement every turn or you're going to lose.  If you have to take a risk to do it, you probably ought to.  Because of this, I think first player advantage is bigger than the game mechanics give it credit for because of the component limit on improvements.  Having first crack at 4 different full-combo improvements to match your initial roll against instead of only 2-3 of them is a really big deal, in my opinion.

This didn't do it for me. Too many things to have to look at when modifying the dice and way more complicated than it needs to be.  Also, it seemed like someone was invariably out of contention in the final round to the point that it didn't make any sense for them to even take a turn.

A re-implementation of To Court the King.  You roll dice to gain tiles.  As you gain tiles it provides more dice or ways to manipulate the dice.  You play until someone takes the queen and triggers the end game.  I liked it a lot and found it very interesting with many paths to victory.

Favor of the Pharaoah is a reimplementation of the game "To Court the King" in a board game format. Out are the cards and the ugly art, in are new custom dice, a large amount of power tiles, and tokens. Are these changes worth the high price? I would say yes. The changes in the game are really fun and the different tiles make the game highly replayable. This is a real gem for dice game enthusiasts.

A gift from my board gaming pals at PrimeTime. Thanks, guys. :)

As of this writing, I've only played the game 7 times, but I can already tell this game is a heck of an improvement over the already great To Court the King. There are tons of new tiles, and the variable setup increases replayability (at the cost of making setting the game up and putting the game away lengthier processes than in TCtK, a price I'm perfectly willing to pay for such amazing gameplay). The custom dice are brilliant (especially the Immediate dice, which allow for dice to exist that are strictly weaker than normal dice, increasing the possibilities for the tiles). The scarab tokens add a new resource management element to the game. I've had an amazingly fun time exploring this game space. Kudos to Tom Lehmann for outdoing himself so brilliantly!

Nice light-weight dice roller.  Fun challenge to find the right combos of dice to win tiles, to roll/adjust more dice, to win more tiles....

I thought the power of the tiles made the game fairly fun, and i liked how you started at the bottom row and sort of worked your way up to the top as your dice pool grows from the newly acquired abilities. It was fine, but i'd be fine if i never played it again.

There's just something about this game that stops it coming to the table as often as I'd thought that it would. It might just be lost in the noise of new releases, I just don't know. It's a fun enough game and it doesn't outstay its welcome, but I can never persuade people to play it twice in a session.

There are so many choices this can overwhelm a casual player; it might be nice to have a beginner setup closer to To Court the King as a starter.

But developing dice-rolling powers is very satisfying.  I suspect we aren't pushing for the final roll off soon enough.

Not bad for what it is.
Yathzee-style dice, trying to roll better, while increasing your chances to mitigate the result. Egyptian theme is welcome, but really pasted on.

Often called "Yahtzee Light," this game is actually more. Not tons more, but more. I feel like it's a nice gateway game that provides a fun and easy introduction into the kind of engine-building and similar thinking processes that are so important for heavier games. It plays quickly, and there certainly is a fair amount of luck (it's dice rolling, after all), but it's a game you can bring out and have fun with in just about any crowd.

I'll grant that the theming of this game is completely pasted on, but at least [b]it IS[/b] an [i][b]exotic[/b][/i] and [i][b]enticing[/b][/i] theme that has been executed with gorgeous colors and artwork which are always great selling points in attracting people to a game. I mean who wouldn't want to look at this gorgeous game versus standard [thing=2243][/thing]?

And the beauty of this game is more than skin deep. It takes dice-rolling and set collection concepts that are familiar from games like Poker and Yahtzee (such as small straight, large straight, four-of-a-kind and 2 pair) and adds to them with new concepts such as "locking" dice and "special powers." It is super easy to grasp how to play and get right into the action and games are under an hour long. AND thanks to it's amazing variable setup there is a ton of replayability. [b]AWESOME![/b]

A reimplementation of the game To Court the King. it is essentially the same game. Get dice to roll dice and get benefits to change dice and first to get the largest collection of the same value wins. This is a bit better than the original because there is more variation and different powers you can utilize. I think there is more replay value. 

I rate this and the To Court the King the same:

This has become a real favourite. Its fun to roll all the dice (particular the custom ones) and even more fun to use the special abilities of the tiles to modify the results and hit the higher combos.

It plays quickly and is different every time so its sure to receive lots more plays in the future. I am sure I will enjoy every single one.

Roll dice to 'earn' add'l dice and get other special powers.  You keep at least one die and can reroll the rest.

You get more 'powerful' as the game continues.  Whoever rolls the highest final roll (based on all their dice and special powers) wins the game.

One of my new favorites, and may be upgraded to a 10 rating at some point if I still like it after more plays. I think of it as [thing=2243][/thing] on steroids, since you're trying to get specific combinations of dice. Has a nice dramatic ending where everybody gets one last turn to try and win.

RATING: 6
A solid improvement on its predecessor.  More of the special powers add choices to your turn, which is good.  Luck on teh first few turns, when you have very few dice, can still determine the game, and there is definitely a rich-get-richer issue.  However, as it adds more choices, there is more opportunity for skill to triumph.

It's annoying that are not more copies of the special dice -- players have to share the dice, which adds to the play time and requires additional accounting every turn.  A dice game really should come with plenty of dice for everyone.

Overall ok game, but I find it is hard to figure out who is the target crowd. My gamer friends find too light and random after a few plays, and downtime boring any counts higher  2.  My light/non-gamer friends, my initial purpose for buying it, find it too fiddly.  The detailed rules around bringing in pre set dice, adjusting faces, having to constantly reexamine which combinations can score a tile, interpreting icons, how to qualify for "all" awards - these greatly hobbled the light- and non-gamer crowd.  I suppose ultimately it is for someone who likes roll for the galaxy and wants an even more dice-adjusting experience. Roll seems like a better game in every way.

RATING: 3
Runaway leader problem! Some nice ideas, but some tiles are so powerful that one bad turn -- even with the tokens -- can destroy the game for you, while two good turns in a row can have another player with more dice and powers than anyone else can overcome. 

It is also a bookkeeping nightmare, keeping track of setup and putting the game away. Storage bins are nice but make no sense in organization as they do not fit any conceivably logical storage plan. Game play bogs down as players check and recheck to see that all tiles are used properly, not to mention figuring out what they all do in the first place.

Best hope for this game is to play it against AI in an app. That way, it is over much quicker and no setup/bookkeeping to bog things down. If app takes a big lead, start over.

Major disappointment. And I wasted money on all the extra dice...

2 plays (plus 1 prototype game)

A nice revision of To Court the King. It includes a lot of the fun characters from the (unpublished) TCtK expansion, as well as a whole lot more: additional characters and dice (as well as the scarab chits), randomized setup, cool-looking (but functionally pointless!) wooden pyramid thingie to hold your locked dice. I think this plays quicker than the original game, even with more than 3 players (the most I'd play TCtK with!). Maybe even a bit too quickly -- you don't get to use all the cool new dice!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a yahtzee-style dice-rolling game where you try to climb a ladder collecting more and more dice and getting better and better rolls.

Each player in this game starts with 3 dice that they roll, they can continue rolling most dice as long as they lock at least one each round.  There are some dice that are automatically locked after the initial roll as well.  When they are finished rolling they can buy a tile from a set of options such as 3-of-a-kind, a pair, a straight, etc.  Some of these tiles provide more dice, some allow you to alter dice, and some are one-per-game powerful abilities.  As you collect more dice you have access to better tiles requiring better rolls such as 4-, 5-, and 6-of-a-kind.  When someone claims the Queen tile, which always requires at least 7-of-a-kind, then a final roll-off is done where a player tries to get the best final roll with their current dice and tiles.

This game for us played really, really fast.  So fast we were concerned we played incorrectly but that's just what this game is.  It's a large box with a lot of stuff in it (especially since I have the extra dice that came with the Bezier 2015 pre-order) but plays very quickly, especially if you use the app for automatic random setup.

Once you know what this is it's a really good game.  You can set it up using the app and finish a game in about 30-45 minutes.  It's really accessible and easy to explain and it looks great.  There's also a decent amount of variety and replayability in the different tiles you can select for each game.

Very nice reimplementation of To Court the King.  The scarab tokens and extra dice really help fix some of the problems with the first player advantage and how far behind you can immediately get if you roll badly.  It's still an engine/racing game, and you can quickly fall behind.  Yes that means "the rich get richer," but I'm not sure I see that it's a bad thing in this case.  It's supposed to be a quick-playing race game where you build on your bonuses.

The new variability in powers and roll combinations is also very welcome.  I wouldn't play with more than 3, but at that number, it's a very solid game.

Not a bad game... but not a good one either. Fairly random and ultimately boils down to a single end roll. Some set ups can make someone ahead just steamroll even farther ahead.

Prefer vivajava over this one due to stronger theme and bit more strategic play. For brainless dice fun i'd go for tumblin' dice. This is somewhere in between. Wouldn't mind if someone brings it along as a filler, but would not seek it out myself as it is a bit too light for what it is (dice collecting).

tl;dr: the same but different

I've always liked [thing=21632][/thing], so when this reimaging with more variation was announced, it went on my 'want to play list' right away. I didn't buy it because I already own the original and wanted to make sure I wanted to own both. Some people I know loved it, some thought the extra stuff made it a bit too much and took away from the charm of the original. So I was a bit hesitant.
I now finally got the chance to play it and indeed, apart from some small rules changes and more variation, it's basically the same game. The variation that is added is very nice, and the different dice do have an impact on strategy. So that's all very nice. All in all it felt very similar to the original, even with all the variation. Yes, the dice and abilities are different, but the feel is the same. I don't think it takes away from the charm of the original, but I also feel it doesn't add enough to own both. If I didn't have the original, I probably would get this.

Yahtzee with dice manipulation. Final roll-offs can be intense, but sometimes an unlucky player may not be able to participate in it at all.

Solid dice rolling game.  I love how there are so many tile so each game feels entirely different depending on which custom die make an appearance.  8 games in and so far we haven't had many meaningful roll-offs to end the game.  I'm not sure if this is a symptom of the game or suboptimal play, but out of 8 games I think we've only had 1 really exciting roll-off.  Set up and tear down takes longer than expected due to the sorting and placing of so many tiles.  In the end, its a very enjoyable game and it plays quick.  We typically play two in a row, although you don't gain much benefit in reducing tear down time by playing back to back.  Its still a bit of a pain but for me, doesn't reduce the enjoyment the game brings to the table.

Dominion the Dice Game. The usual Yahtzee mechanic but you use the dice rolls to buy upgrades which add more dice, allow to change rolls etc. Goal is to roll 7 of a kind.

RATING: 2.5
This game is just a bad idea.  "Let's make Yahtzee take even longer, be much more complicated and fiddly, and involve a big mess of tiles and dice scattered all over the table!"  I don't see why this game would have any appeal to anyone.

RATING: 6
One of the best Yahtzee style games that I've played. I definitely like it more than King of Tokyo/New York, VivaJava Dice Game, and the Roll Through the Ages games.

For one, the victory condition really makes the game stand out. When a person claims a certain tile late in the game, everyone else gets a final turn to see if they can beat that person's dice roll. Meaning they have to have more matching dice, or the same amount of matching dice but of a higher number. This makes for a fun final round.

The way you continuously gain new powers to manipulate your dice is fun. VivaJava the Dice Game did this, but it works much better here.

Good game. I just don't rate it higher because it still comes down to being a Yahtzee variant with a lot of dice rolling luck.

Sold.

Favor Of The Pharaoh is a dice rolling engine builder that works slightly better than a pyramid scheme.

The decisions are mostly trivial and the game ramps up so quickly it is over in the blink of an eye - but it is well designed and can hold your interest because it doesn't overstay it's welcome - however, there are much better choices available in this genre.

An improved and refined version of To Court the King. A bit of the elegance is lost (though I have not tried every setup, so I suppose a similar setup is possible), but the veriety is much higher. Some of the iconography is a bit tricky to read. The theme is still a bit pasted on.

Better than the original (To Court the King). Great components. Excellent game variability (with all the different ways/combinations that this game can be set up). Fast and tense play until the end. It plays in an hour and typically you will have two games in a row.

Favor of the Pharaoh is Yahtzee plus. You start with three dice and you want to roll various configurations, like "all even" or 1 pair or three of a kind. Doing so let's you claim tiles from a central market. Tiles get you more dice and special powers. When you have more dice you can try for better combinations, like straights, full houses, etc. You have to lock at least one die every roll, but you can keep rolling the rest.

There are various types of dice that have funky powers, like white dice which must be locked after you roll them. Green dice that don't have a six, but instead have a face that let's you reset any two dice to a face of your choice. There are dice that only have low numbers and others that only have high numbers, etc. There are also special tiles you can get that let you increase the value of a die by one pip or reroll a die.

The game ends when anyone chooses to make a set of 7 dice of some number. Then everyone gets one more turn to exceed that set, either by rolling the same number of higher pip value dice or more a set of more dice.

The game is somewhat strategic and is more interesting than Yahtzee, but it's by no means a deep game. It was vastly more fun than Machi Koro ever was for me. But at best it's quick filler fodder. There's a lot of tiles that aren't in play in any particular game so the setup seems to take a bit of time. And towards the end of the game it became clear that having more dice than other players was going to be the thing that decided the game.

RATING: 6
Very much an improvement on To Court the King, still a lean game of dice-pool building that crescendos to a close. Unfortunately still a victim of some players being SOL in the final roll-off (despite the excellent addition of "everyone who didn't get a final turn gets an extra die"), and the increased setup/tear-down with the new variable setup comes out in the wash.

:star::star::star::star:

Some people seem to really get into the excitement of rolling and rerolling dice. I am not among them, and I regard most dice games as simply dull. Favor of the Pharaoh is the exception, the game took the only dice game I've found any good and turned it into something great. 

The look is generally garish, but in all other aspects it's an improvement on the original [thing=21632][/thing].  
[microbadge=34678] Better balance of addition and manipulation.
[microbadge=34678] Single-use tiles and tokens.
[microbadge=34678] An insert worth a damn.
[microbadge=34678] Full-size box, with enough game to fill it.
[microbadge=34678] Groovy custom dice.
[microbadge=34678] Enough modularity to make Donald X. jealous.

Having played this and its predecessor, "To Court the King," the update is better in every way. Most of this stems from the vast amount of variability. At its core, I'd still classify this game as "Yahtzee on steroids," but I say that in the most flattering sense of the phrase.

Has very nice custom dice, but it's nowhere as interesting as a proper deck building game. The 'cards' don't have particularly interesting special powers.

Very interesting concept and game play through Poker combination of dice. It has a similar mechanism as Yahtzee, but with a little bit of theme.

Was a little slow at first as most of the effects need to be looked up in the rules. After playing through a time or two it's easy to remember. I wouldn't suggest this for young or casual gamers.

Updated and perhaps overproduced version of [gameid=21632].

RATING: 7
The best description of this I can give is a love child between Dominion and Yahtzee. Player's start with 3 dice and an ultimate goal of rolling seven of a kind. Obviously that's impossible with three dice, which is where the Dominion aspects come in. Each turn, a player rolls their dice, locks at least one and maybe more, then rolls again. They continue this process until all of their dice have been locked, or they choose to stop. At this point, they may claim a tile based on the difficulty of their resulting die roll (two pair, full house, straight, etc.) which gives them a special power; the most common of which is more dice. There are also ways to mitigate the die rolls, all of which help you eventually get to that goal of rolling a seven of a kind.

It's silly fun. Not terribly strategic or interactive, but rolling the dice and figuring out the best way to make them  hit your target numbers is quite entertaining. There are quite a few different tile effects and plenty of room for expansion, so no two games should ever play out the same way, which is always a great feature in a game of this sort.

You start out with three dice and by buying cards that give you additional ones, or cards that let you manipulate your dice, you're trying to roll a seven-of-a-kind. The game is fun, has nice components, custom dice and a sturdy box. The insert could have been less confusing though, and the $50 pricetag for the game is too steep for what you get in return.

I want to call this a Yahtzee variant but that is usually viewed as deregatory. Modular setup. Start with 3 dice and keep rolling and save dice results (must lock at least one per roll) to your pyramid. Spend your saved dice results on auction tiles that can be added to your tableau. More difficult combinations unlock more powerful tiles. Build your engine towards bigger and better tiles until you can make a huge dice run for the favor of the Pharaoh. This dice engine builder with all the combinations of bars and tiles could make this interesting. I'm a little concerned that player turns may run long. This replaces my other yahtzee variant games.

A really fun dice-roller that has beautiful components, although I do wish every player got their own set of dice. The tile powers are cool and rolling and manipulating the dice is a bit thinky and cool at the same time. My only complaint is that if there isn't a final roll-off the game does end in a bit of an anti-climax.

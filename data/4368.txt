I'm a big fan of The Gamers' Civil War Brigade Series. The rules, while seemingly complex, are fairly straight forward. You will not want to play this with a rules lawyer as the orders system is someone subjective. ITQF is somewhat limited in the option it present users; there will be no tactical finessing. However, it is still fun.

Garish map, not much room for maneuver, chaotic initial deployment, and the terrible lack of Corps structure makes this one of the less pleasant
of the CWB series.

As to the Corps structure, this is something ITQF shares with all of the ANV early scenarios. Divisional 'bolting down' simply doesn't work well when applied to every unit in the army.

I'm not generally a Civil War guy (with a few exceptions like GCACW), but for what it's worth, I am decidedly not a fan of The Gamers' CWBS despite quite enjoying OCS, TCS, and SCS. It just seems like too much work for too little payoff - you roll tons of dice on lots of charts for relatively little impact. Gamers' Games trademark is that they are fairly incremental, with small effects adding up dramatically over a long game. CWBS in my opinion goes *to* far in that direction, with too much playing time being required to add up even to somthing insignificant. The game also does not sufficiently encourage players to break off their attacks; every game I've played has seen players pushing bloody attacks far beyond anything that ever happened historically; which means you don't have the historical "breaks" in the action and everything takes absolutely forever to play. Some of the smaller entries like Champion Hill might be more palatable, but the bigger games did absolutely nothing for me. I can't even *imagine* playing RSS.

One of my favourite systems ever, CWB does a great job of evoking the ACW.

Antietam just doesn't hold the interest for me that other ACW battles do. However, the 'McClellan Points' do an excellent job of preventing the Union player over-running the CSA position. Coordinate your attacks too well (as McClennan was incapable of doing historically, to an astonishing degree), and you will accumulate too many McClennan Points to win.

Dragged down a little by that technicolour map.

Harsh map, but that's the style and you can't deny it's effective. As for the game, it does a very good job of simulating the battle of Antietam. Mac's reluctance is captured elegantly by the orders system which is the real, and relatively simple gem that drives this fantastic system. The intensity of the cornfield comes out as you cross off the casualties and the difficulty of coordinating the attacks is there for the Union Player. The CSA player gets to make some relatively straightforward decisions, pulling units from one part of the line, moving them to another section etc. As noted, it's a good simulation of Antietam. 
It is however, a relatively uninteresting battle - not the fault of the game, but a reflection of what happened. If the Union can and do coordinate their attacks, it can turn into a crushing victory. But it's just a straight up slog if they do. Otherwise it's a series of uncoordinated slogs. Much like the real battle. I suppose the game illustrates that it could and should've been a bloody slog as Lee's army was gradually hammered into submission on several fronts. But then there's Mac...

Really good simulation, excellent system, but ultimately a relatively uninteresting battle. Far more interesting imo are the much more open and manoeuvre-heavy, and the what-if scenarios in 3 Battles of Manassas or Thunder at the Crossroads.

Smaller than the other games in the series, only one map and the longest scenario is just 25 turns. No time or space for subtle manouevre, just line up the troops and blast away. The excitement comes from hustling Confederate remnants from one side of the battlefield to the other to fend off various Union sledgehammers. The joker in the pack for the Union is the concept of McClellan Points - rack up too many by giving lots of orders, and you'll be hard-pushed to win.

I bought this because the series looked promising yet this game is a total mess. The rulebook is horrid, there are too many charts, and the components are ugly. I play many complex games like [i]Rise and Decline of the Third Reich[/i], but this one takes the cake in worthless density. The map is the ugliest thing I've ever seen in gaming.

Just traded for the second edition, much improved graphics over the first edition.  This is my favorite Civil War battle, and this battle is one of the most difficult to game because McClellan was such an idiot.  The use of McClellan points is brilliant.  The Union player can move as much as he wants and when he wants, but it had better work BIG if he does.  It makes the Union player want to follow history, but does not force him too.  Great map, great counters, great system, great battle, great game.

Antietam is a good battle to showcase the Gamers (MMP) Civil War Brigade (CWB) system.  It makes full use of the single map without much stacking of units.  The map is a real joy, with colorful (but not garish) terrain height background and trees in full fall foliage (perfect for the date of the battle).  The pieces are easy enough to read and group by formation, although nothing fancy.  The log sheets and tables are just paper in the rules booklet though, so it's better to download copies from the Gamers Archive and print them on heavier stock.  While you're at it, download the latest rules.  I've finally bitten the bullet and downloaded the whole archive for every game I'd ever consider getting.

This was my first introduction to the CWB system (v3.2).  I tried it after reading many Napoleonic game reviews that ended "I wish this system were more like CWB".  I can now see their point.  The command and control system, while thorough, with written orders and command radii at corps and division level, takes up a small fraction of the playing time.  Yet it contributes a lot to the feel of the game.  I've never, until now, understood why so many Civil War battles happened a corps or two at a time.  Now I get it.  Ordering these clods around with the methods available takes command time, and there isn't really a staff in that era capable of shouldering some of the burden for the leader.  Then the corps commanders take a goodly, and uncertain, time to get their troops moving.  Local initiative is almost as likely to end in debacle as success.  So ... armies attack slowly and carefully, and still sometimes botch it.  And when they DO attack, they're just as likely to have a corps commander lose his nerve, break off his attack and await further orders.  How Lee kept his hair I do not know.  The operational art involved in running a Civil War battle is captured well by this system.  You really have to plan ahead.  The end result is a battle that flows at a historic pace in the Civil War version of the classic military hurry-up-and-wait.

Combat: to paraphrase Napoleon, in this fairly attritional combat system God is on the side with the big brigades.  Watch out, however, for those morale rolls - poor troops are likely to freak and run.  The rules suggest a color-coded bucket-of-dice system for speeding up combat rolls.  It REALLY works.  If you bite the bullet and acquire the right dice, combat is fast, despite the multiple tables.

Bottom line: the system and game are good at both the operational (multi-corps) and tactical (brigades within a division) levels.  It plays out in an easy weekend.  One lesson learned though: Play the full game, even if it takes a bit longer than one of the short scenarios.  You DON'T want to start with the mess McClellan leaves you with by mid-morning.

What a system, what a game! Combat can take a long time, but I enjoy every minute of these games. I hadn´t played real wargames for a long time, and now I know what I have been missing. This is so different from German boardgames, whom I still enjoy a lot, but a great wargame is so much more.

This system truly reflects the issues of C3 in a civil war battle. While some people decry the use of so many dice in the resolution of combat, the results of those rolls accurately reflect the uncertainty of combat. I played one game where an entire brigade was disrupted because the regiment with the worst morale was placed on the flank. Historically, the strongest and most experienced units were placed on the flanks to steady the other units. The game system rewards those who utilize contemporary tactics, and penalizes those who try to recreate Operation Barbarossa with infantry regiments. As others have stated, do not play this game with a rules lawyer as the written command system leaves quite a bit of room for interpretation.

CWB series was and still is one of my favorites. Having to write rules in advance and having the situation change before you execute gives me the feel for civil war battles.

Had played first edition with the current rule set before and the upgraded graphics are much nicer.

Antietam is tough since you have to account for McClellan, if the union army is unleashed the Confederates will be demolished.

In my opinion one of the best on the series. Command system varies from other tiltes in the way orders are issued. This is due to smaller action area than the average of other games. The difference between Antietam I and II is just the graphics. In their Quiet fields II has clearer map and counters, so if you plan buying this title I strongly recommend version II. Exciting battle in which Union fight against incompetence and Confederate against lack of resources. The best is that you do not know who  wins until the really end. Just a drawback: High risk for Confederate player exposing his leaders on combat. If Lee, Jackson or Longstreet are woundeed or killed in combat you are really lost. That means Confederate must to be so cautious using his leaders on combat. I lost several times just because Jackson was dead or Lee Wounded. Is it really fair? One good, really good game anyway. Just grab it and play it, it is all enjoyment

RATING: 8.5
The origin of the CWB series and a great treatment of the battle.  Short of requiring frontal lobotomies or administering haluconogenic drugs, properly handicapping the Union under McClellan must be one of the greatest challenges in wargame design.  The Command rules and McClellan points do as good a job as any game published. Without McClellan, there is no Antietam.  With him, you get to experience (enjoy is MUCH too strong!) the most frustrating CWB battle of all.IMHO the CWB series truly shines when the player is "confronted" with historical leaders like McClellan, Pope, Bragg, Buell, McClernand, etc.

The Gamers CWB series game.  Good game on the topic.  Map and counters are well done, really gives the flavor of the Civil War.  

As the Union player (McClellan), it can be a bit frustrating as you'll have plenty of units to crush the Confederates, but things just won't go the way you (the player) would want them to.  McClellan... not such a good gamer....For Gen'l Lee, things will be pretty tense throughout the game.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A lots of blue soldier and a Army of Virginia in a dramatical situation. Lee, Longstreet and Jackson have to use their superior skills to counter the massive union attacks.
From Army of Potomac point of view, victory seems easy to get but casualties will be heavy and Little Mac, even with Lee's army whipped out, will think that he is outnumbered.

I like the command structure and the fog of war aspect.  It really gives the feel of the problems of command during this war.  I find the rules well balanced, not simplistic but not overly difficult either.  Just enough to give good depth while maintaining fun game play.  

My only problem is it just takes too long to play because it's such a good simulation.  I no longer have the time to play a game that takes longer than the actual event did.

The battle of Antietam, or Shapsburg, if you prefer.  Not like some other "Civil War Brigade Series" games in that there aren&#039;t as many optional units, but the McLellan rules let the Union player push the envelope of history, for a price. Try to ignore the, uhh, full colour map. For CWBS comments, see "Champion Hill"

A solid entry point for the Civil War Brigade series. The original edition was Dean Essig's first published game, and the orders system was probably created as a way of eliminating the usual McClellan "idiocy" rules that most Antietam games rely on. You can now have Little Mac try to get his whole army in motion...and almost surely fail...while suffering Victory Point penalties rather than arbitrary restrictions on numbers of units moved or engaged.

A good deal more tactical than other games, but not without its high drama. Union corps stoppage checks become the central mechanism to the game, and the Confederates wonder what hodge-podge of units they can scrape together to hold off that final 2:00 corps attack. 
Not the best in the series, mainly because it doesn't show off the command system as well as other games. Still rather good, of course.

Always tense and exciting. For me, it's definitely in the upper-half of CWB games. It's also, IMO, the best of the games that emphasizes a set-piece situation. Other set-piece CWB games (like, say, April's Harvest), aren't quite as good. The system shines best in meeting engagement or maneuver situations like Gettysburg, Chickamauga or the Seven Days.

Brigade level, battle of Antietam.  Extremely long playing time, at least for the whole battle.  Command and control rules are second to none.

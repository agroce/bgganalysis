Such a cute little game! And really fun too. I think the appeal of this game is the god powers and trying to outmaneuver your opponent. 3-player games have been prone to kingmaking.

RATING: 5
Cannot believe this game has been released in 2016. Santorini is a pure abstract with mechanics as innovative as any abtract in 80's or 90's. Reminds me of Torres quite a bit except for that Torres has an interesting scoring mechanic with a lot to ponder whereas Santorini is very straightforward sporting a dull sudden death winning criteria.

Folks admire the looks but personally I dislike the polished and childish art although I have to admit the plastic components look nice. But they are not exceptional (compared to e.g. aforementioned Torres) and actually the first and second tier building blocks are easy to mix up.

Ok, Santorini is not a bad game but very outdated without any innovations. Ok at best.

Excellent abstract game that is absolutely beautiful in its new 3D implementation.  Mechanics simple enough for a kid to grasp but still a lot of rich gameplay here for more experienced gamers as well.  

Plays in about 10-15 minutes, so multiple games easy in a single sit down.  I've found enough enjoyment with the regular game that I haven't yet tried the pantheon of choices provided by the 'God' powers, but expect those will keep this fresh for a long time.

Initial thoughts.

Played base game with God cards.

Overproduced but very good abstract game. Spatial movement is interesting. The variable powers from the God cards adds an interesting tactical element as it allows easier alternate victory conditions.

It was funny to catch myself playing with the little figures and plastic blocks in the shape of this Greek island's homes with the intensity of chess.

Neat game, but the god powers can create wild imbalances and very uneven gameplay, with some of them forcing opponents to make certain moves or play certain ways.

Medusa (crush opponents with buildings) forces one player to try and hide, whereas Persephone (opponent must move up if possible) can play opponents turns for them.

Definitely a lot of tactical and strategic potential, but I just can't get over the god powers that seem to pigeonhole playstyles.

RATING: 5
Perhaps not challenged enough by opponent, but I'm almost positive that my experience stems from my personal feeling of complete disinterest.  I'd play with a young child for their personal entertainment. I also beleive the game has hit the marks it's design team intended to hit hence the rating being middle of the road. It's a great game for what it is, but it's not a favorite of mine.

Will keep in collection for gaming light guests or children. Probably will never put it on the table in which I've a seat.  Definitely won't.

RATING: 4
I wasn't too interested in this game before I played it, but once I did, I still found little interest in it. It's a glorified Connect Four. Typically, I've liked glorified versions of basic games. I hate Werewolf, but really enjoy Secret Hitler. I'm not much for Liar's Dice, but House of Borgia is great. This game it still too basic for me though. I'm also not impressed with the cheap, bland plastic building prices that remind me of something I played with as a child in the 80's. 

I haven't had a chance to play the game with the God powers, so I'd give it another chance, but even then, I don't think that's going to be enough to enhance my enjoyment of the game that much.

1st play: Beautiful production, clean abstract game with a good theme and tons of replay ability.  The basic game of trying to get to the top floor without getting blocked is interesting enough and the god powers ramp it up. A little of the 'Glory to Rome' feeling where it seems like every power is too strong. Like any good abstract you have to balance defensive blocking with trying to win and not get yourself boxed in. 

2nd play: Played 3p and the game continues to shine.  Looks amazing on the table with fun variable player powers which shake up the game without making it chaotic.  Not much else to say except that it's an excellent abstract game that I'm happy to play anytime.

Fantastic! I usually enjoy abstracts very much, but this one is amazing, the game is very simple and clever by itself, and the gods powers put this game into another level with a lot of replayability. I enjoyed the quality of the components and art, and the effort to bring a theme to an abstract game that is fine and I can buy the idea.

Santorini hits so many right notes for me: pure strategy, quick games, 2 players, simple rules yet tons of variety with the god cards, top quality components, beautiful art, and even the mechanically unnecessary yet aesthetically delightful 3D board.

Need to play this more.  Just played with the base game and no gods.  Got it the same day as Haru Ichiban and my wife loves that one so we always play that instead now. We also got hive around the same time and she prefers that one to this as well.

I am happy for now with that, the idea was to get a fast 2 player game we can easily play and we got that, it just wasn't this.

Excellent abstract game that plays best with 2 players! Easy to learn and fast to play with a lot of strategy, it's so awesome that doesn't compare with the previous version in quality terms. A game that keeps evοlving! Well done! The only "complain" is why did the developers think it can be a 3 or 4 player game! To be honest that's a 2-player only game for me and that's how a play it! One of the best abstracts out there with "a touch" of theme...

This is one of the great 2-player abstract games.  The elegance of design and simplicity of the rules, makes it a wonderful tussle just as it is.  But add onto this the astounding production from Roxley including the fantastic island and buildings, plus gorgeous artwork from Mr Cuddington, PLUS all the different god powers which dramatically adds variability and replayability - and all delivered in just 15-20 mins.

An excellent little puzzle game, and the short rules set make this really kid-friendly. That said, a few of the gods are a bit unbalanced, which to some degree limits its replayability. It's cute but more of an oddity and diversion than something I'd like to bring to the table regularly.

Backed this on Kickstarter on a whim, but I am so glad I did.  This is a very fine abstract decked out in great visual form.  The elevated board is entirely unecessary, but it gives the game great aesthetics.  Game play is very fast to learn, but like all abstracts requires you to think ahead.  The artwork for the Greek gods is fantastic and very family friendly.  The wide variety of god duel options is very cool and it makes the replay of the game very high.  Production quality of the game is outstanding - really, really nicely made.  As a fan of abstract games, this one hits the mark very well.  Highly recommended.

Good looking and overpriced game. Very simple rules: move and build. Yes, you heard right - just two rules. You heard it right.

Game is short, requires plenty of attention. Gods give a little twist to the rules, but don't flip rules dramaticly.

Still my favourite abstract game is blokus trigon. I can not find reasons I don't like it, I prefer other games over it (blokus, photosyntesis, abalone)

Quite fun, abstract at heart.  Each player has two figures, M&F.  Tactical basic game, each player trying to be first to place a figure in the third level.

Initial Impression: I don't hide my feelings when it comes to abstract games. I'm not fond of them. This abstract game, however, is linked to a theme that gives it life and flavor. The components convey the theme; board raised on cliffs, building pieces, god cards, and even the workers. The game can be taught in 2 minutes and gameplay generally doesn't last more than 20 minutes. I believe that this game, along with Hive, will permanently fill the abstract game spot in my collection. It's already a hit with the kids.

Santorini is a fantastic abstract game that reminds me of my younger years when I first learned to play chess. It is an awesome strategy game that is in my opinion equally good whether you have 2, 3, or 4 people. The aesthetics are beautiful and the whole feel of the game is top notch. If you like shorter, but still challenging and dynamic, strategy games this one is for you. Easy for kids to grasp too if you play without the power cards. Recommended Players: 2-4.

Not bad. Once you or your opponent is able to wall off one piece, the game seems to play itself. While the asymmetrical powers are cool, I'm not sure I appreciate the lack of balance they have.

RATING: 7
For an abstract game, it doesn't feel like it thanks to the huge amount of God powers and the components are gorgeous! Quick strategic game but can end up playing multiple times in a sitting thanks to the huge array of powers, you won't feel like you're playing the same game twice.

However, if the components are not that great, I probably will not be interested in the game at all. I really dislike Chess and find it dull, this has slight similarities to it. This game doesn't particularly excites me when I play it, I'm keeping it around cause I recognize that it's a good hard-to-get abstract strategic game, just not my cup of tea.

It's a pure abstract at it's core and there's probably better abstract games out there. However, this is definitely great on it's own but then is presented in a great package with top-notch components. Even the little plastic base is completely aesthetic but really does a great job of adding to the appeal of the game. The base game is very solid but in addition the game comes with a few dozen god cards that gives you powerful special abilities. I've only just begun exploring these and some just seem better than others but exploring those powers adds so much replayability. Great components and great game that is easily teachable but still gives you lots of complex choices in a short time.

An abstract game with nice components. It plays up to four, but like most abstracts it seems to scale best at two. I haven't played with the god powers. It looks like they might provide some imbalances.

A very solid little strategy game. I absolutely love the fact you can teach this in under a minute and have your first game played in 10 minutes. The game without the god cards is incredibly solid. I haven't played with every god yet, but I feel like they also add a lot of variety to the game and keep it fresh if you get bored of playing without them. Adding the gods feels a bit like playing a "Mario Party" mode. It's hard to explain, some of them add pure insanity to the experience but in a great way.

Regardless, really like the game, don't think I'd ever turn down a game of it and I'd say I'm really likely to play two or three games in a row.

Brilliant two player game. At its core, it is an abstract game that feels thematic. I love how easy it is to teach and the replay value is through the roof. While it isn't my favorite game, Santorini is a must own game that I cannot imagine will ever leave my collection. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Beautiful game. Easy to teach. Quick playtime that often lead to more plays. Surprisingly more thinky than it first appears. The different powers also add quite a bit of variation to it, fulfilling the promise of this being a game you'll play for a long time with nearly any age group.

I wouldn't have a game night based around Santorini alone, but it'll forever be in my collection as a go-to beginning of the night/end of the night/casual crowd type game. 

This is clearly best with two players however. With three you may have a slight problem with king making near the end if any of the players choose to focus on blocking another for multiple rounds....But to be honest it didn't feel like that big of a problem, especially since the game is on the shorter side and the feel of it doesn't exactly inspire mean-spirited play. I also couldn't imagine four players being any worse than that.

Will most likely pick up The Golden Fleece Expansion as soon as possible. While you won't feel like it's necessarily needed for quite some time, the variation available is too tempting for me to pass up.

I was completely surprised by Santorini.  It really ticks the box for me as a thinky abstract with heaps of theme.

But once I got it to the table I knew it was a 10!

The strategy in here is over the top as you get your head around the core rules and the balance between offensive play and defensive play.

It's a must play, accessible for families and HEAPS of re-playability for Gamer types.

All that said, am I the only one thinking that rules (as explained in the rulebook) aren't all that simple? One extra sentence explaining where Domes can be placed/built (in base game) would have been wonderful. >:(

   Almost like a three-dimensional tic-tac-toe, Santorini is an extremely accessible game, granted longeveity with the addition of character cards that ensures variable game play.

   I don't mind the cartoon characters at all, but the plastic pieces cheapen the game.  It's a shame, really...  This could have been such an elegant game.  That said, I Santorini is no doubt an essential cornerstone of my collection!

Roxley hit the ball out of the park with Santorini. The gameplay is fun if you like abstract games (I do!), but the addition of the God cards is what makes the game great, as each duel poses a different challenge. The gorgeous production helps convince other people to try the game and enhances the overall experience. Even my 9-year old son enjoys Santorini. I really hope this game becomes a big seller for Roxley.

More data is possibly required for this one, especially at 2 players, as so far I have only played with three. Still... this one really didn't thrill me. What's the big deal? The components? Oh they're great. Excellent even, and the art is beautiful. The elegant rules? Sure! That's nice, I guess. Maybe more like "fine," as elegant makes me think of Reiner Knizia... and then I yawn. In the end this is still just an abstract with a check-mate style ending (which I tend to dislike, so personal-bias alert) and though it's fast, well, so are a lot of two-player games with THEME. Maybe that's my real hang up. I will try and revisit this if I get a chance, but I'm not going to run over to the table when someone takes it out. May just not be for me.

After having owned the original wooden white pieces made by Gord for 10 years, I have to say that I actively dislike the kiddie art.
It's a step down for serious adult abstract players. Call me old school, but I prefer the clean, compact, wooden 2007 edition. 

That being said, it's been a decades long journey to get this professionally published, so it is a good thing that it's getting known and recognized by the wider gaming community beyond abstract players. I suppose the kiddie art is a marketing scheme for the game to appeal to families, and reach a wide audience beyond hobbyists.

The Good-Powers aren't very well balanced. There are some possibilities one Good can easily beat many other Goods. e.g. Aphrodite, Demeter, Hecate.
Eros will always be defeated from Gaia. The second Player who chooses his Good wins probably. The Expansion allows the Players to act as one selected good, which is more fair. (On selecting the Power per dice it's just the luck to get the stronger Power.)

Santorini has the distinction of filling many roles at once, and doing all of them pretty well. It’s an abstract game, but one with a distinct and memorable theme. It’s an “easy to learn, tough to master” sort of game that actually has a wealth of variety. It’s a good gateway game that even kids can easily enjoy, yet there’s some deep strategy here for those looking to find it. It’s a rare gem that claims to be “fun for all ages” and actually *is*.

While the game supports up to four players, it seems ideal with two. Players play on a five-by-five chess board with two pawns apiece. Each turn, a player must move and then build, with a move consisting of moving one of their two pawns to one of the eight adjacent spaces, and then building on one of the spaces adjacent to that. Every space can be built up four times – three levels of building and one blue “cap” piece. Pawns can only move up one space and cannot move to “capped” spaces. A player wins either when they move one of their pawns to an uncapped third level, or when the other player cannot make a legal move on their turn.

And that’s it, the entire base game right there. Which in and of itself would be a strong game – extremely simple to learn, with some good potential for strategy, and the unique build/climb/block gameplay is original enough to set the game apart. However, the game takes things a step further with optional “god cards”.

Players wanting a more advanced game can play with these cards that grant each player one of thirty unique abilities that remains with them throughout the game. A card could give a player the ability to move twice, or to swap their pawns with their opponent, cap squares that don’t have a level-three building on them, or even add an extra win condition. And since the player who chooses the god cards isn’t the player who selects the one they’ll be playing with, it means that even though these abilities are wildly different, they’re likely to be fairly evenly-matched. As an end result,  what was already a well-crafted and interesting game gets infused with a wealth of replayability on top of that thanks to what amounts to countless game variants created by these unique powers.

Visually, the game looks beautiful, although some might be turned off by the somewhat kiddy art. Everything is consistent and cohesive, and really helps to push the game’s rounded, cartoony look. The game’s pieces are a bit light and flimsy-feeling, and cleanup can be a bit of a hassle since there are literally over a hundred large pieces here, but I can’t really see how it could have been done better without significantly upping the game’s cost. It bears mention that even the buildings themselves have a fair amount of personality to them, with doors and staircases helping to mimic the design of the buildings in the actual city of Santorini.

All in all, this is a wonderful game that is deserving of a spot in just about any game collection. I highly recommend it.

Beautiful game, beautiful art, and a simple mechanic. This is an abstract game that is wrapped beautifully in a white-blue theme of Santorini, a beautiful city in Greece. In this game, we need to build the city and race to get to the top of the third floor before someone put the blue roof on the shiny white building. The movement is simple: you move and you build. Be careful not to get trapped between the buildings that you cannot jump over! I think this game should be a must-have game for the family that would start to play something more complex.

A great, quick, easy to learn, abstract game where you try to out-maneuver your opponent on a 3D player grid testing your spacial recognition. Preferred only to be a maximum of 2-players, you will strive to outplay your opponent with character abilities and component placement.  If you like the Greek Gods genre, this is a great game to brush up on your knowledge of them and increase your skills on component placement.  A fun game that has a lot of eye candy!

This is a fantastic gem that's maybe best described as an abstract for people that don't like abstracts. It's beautiful and really narrows the scope of decisions down to a tactical nature. You're playing to make the best move now while leaving your options open to respond as well as pursue offense. It feels more narrow in what decisions you need to analyze and apply within any given single move (since you're limited to just two pieces and certain moves are necessary as prevention), yet the decisions spiral outward and cascade with future moves to where each game still feels very deep and dynamic.

This is a pretty fun game, made better by the powers that really mix things up, and change your tactics each game.  Played 2 vs 2, which actually worked out really good.  I wonder if I would prefer it 1 vs 1.  Some powers could only be used in certain games, and didn't work when other powers were in play.  This part didn't sit with me well, but was understandable with a kickstarter game.

RATING: N/A
Great game for kids. Rules are very simple, especially if you don’t introduce god powers. My 5 yr old does great, although he can’t think more than one turn ahead. Honestly, he prefers to just play with the pieces and build neighborhoods and castles, but we can always get in a full game before the urge takes him. 

Would also be fun with adults, especially with the god powers. (I haven’t played with an adult yet.) The god powers are so numerous and the strategy sufficiently deep that there is endless replayability, I suspect more than chess.

I love a good abstract, and this definitely qualifies! I'm not sure it's as deep as YINSH, and it's definitely not as tense... but it does have that great feeling of pushing your opponent into defense mode. With the god powers though, this game becomes something really special. Infinite matchups makes for HIGH replayability, and the quick playtime gives it that "just one more game" addictive quality.

An abstract.  I don't like abstract games, and I do not like this one.  It's all about manipulating the board, and although I played twice with an open mind, I just couldn't get the concept in an effort to make it work.

I probably won't play this again.  It isn't a bad game, I just didn't like it very much.

An abstract game that looks beautiful, plays quick, and has very simple rules. Move one of your two builders 1 space and then build in any adjacent space. Can be taught in 5 minutes, and played over and over. Then you can add in all the player powers and the game has infinite replayability. I enjoyed my 2 plays immensely and will be looking to try this one out with the wife real soon. My only concern is for her that this is a very quiet/thinking game sort of like Chess and that may not be for her, but this is at least a great 2-player game.

I was really impressed by this one.  The basic game feels like a game that would be on par with checkers or connect 4, but I don't feel like a child for playing it.

Its a fine abstract strategy game.  the god powers change the game too much IMHO and create an asymmetrical not well balanced experience.  the production is over the top, not the quality the production quality is fine, just the production itself is overblown.  a slightly raised board for no reason, different elaborately molded pieces for each level.

If this isn't a 10 I don't know what is.  Checks every box for me.

--Absurdly easy to teach and learn

--Looks beautiful on the table
--Deep strategic gameplay without much potential for AP
--Can be a chess-like battle of wits (without god powers) or an arcade-y romp (with god powers)
--Only abstract where I've seen laugh-out-loud moments occur (e.g. trapping your opponent's builder in a corner)
--Great with 2, but I've had lots of fun with 3 and could technically play up to 6 (3 teams of two minds each)

Another 'brilliance in its simplicity game' like Onitama. Great strategy game even without using the special power cards. More accessible than Onitama, and more fun due to the extra level of strategy with the varying god cards; and the fact that an actual city rises throughout the game makes it visually appealing. Best two player game owned by a small margin over Onitama; and a large margin over Battle Line and Biblios.

This game is just simply amazing.  The back and forth nature of the game is very intriguing.  The god powers might be somewhat imbalanced, but I don't play this game to be the champion of Santorini.  Being "outmatched" is often a challenge.

The more I play, the more I think the god powers actually make the game worse.

Some are WAY too overpowered unless you get their perfect counter.

I've started to prefer the game without any powers, since it feels much more...in the players hands as opposed to the god card winning the game.

The components - beautiful and adorable. The rules - super easy to learn.

The only problem - this game doesn't really do much for me - it's in the style of checkers and other abstract games where you're constantly trying to one-up your opponent and block them from advancing.

I'd play this again, but I wouldn't ask for it myself.

Very quick to learn.  Abstract game, which are not in my top genre, but this is good.  Beautiful components.  

The gods cards provide lots of variations on powers (perhaps too much?).  But all good.  Need to test a few more out and focus on the favorites.  

Because it's an abstract, I can play 2 or 3 games and then my head hurts.  One of most beautiful looking games I picked up in 2016.

Game length can be [i]highly[/i] dependent on the level of player analysis. Either make sure everyone is on the same page about "how much time per turn are we taking?", or use a chess clock. For now at least, I like it better as a quick game where mistakes happen than a deep-lookahead brain-burner.

Nice, fast abstract - best offense/defense dilemmas are created with three players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a very interesting title.  First, games are super quick - usually around 10 minutes at most.  Second, there is a weird feature where you win the game before you win the game.  Basically, you'll know when you've forced the other player into a position where you guarantee a win - a checkmate situation, basically, where you never actually do the thing you need to do (get on a tower).  This makes it a bit anti-climactic, even if it is satisfying to achieve such a position. 

Compare to any other of our favourite abstracts, like Azul or Morocco, where there is still the potential for forcing an amazing turn (usually screwing the other guy) but that doesn't end the game.  Indeed, you can still recover from that.  Hell, even 7 Wonders Duel has this.

This isn't a knock against Santorini, it's just to point out a very different feel to the victory.  I think it works for a quick game like this.

WHAT A PHENOMENAL GAME!!
Culled from the ranks of great abstracts like Chess, Santorini is a home run, not just in the simplicity of the game play, but in the quality and attractiveness of its components. You really look and feel like you're building a city with each game you play.

Simple enough to teach to anyone, yet with enough depth to make each game different than the last, Santorini is the perfect game to close the age gap. Children as young as 8 can learn it within a few minutes, and they'll be playing it for life. The God cards elevate this game beyond its core move-build mechanics and offer much more strategy. Plus, with the variety of God powers included, the replay value is sky-high. A MUST PLAY for anyone that enjoys simple games that are simply enjoyable to play. One of my very few 10-rated games.

A true skilled game where the better player is almost always going to win. Like chess, you need to be thinking 2 or 3 turns ahead to really be effective at this game.

Excellent game with delightful art, stunning components, and a hugely varied set of special powers to use; I strongly recommend you start using the god cards as soon as possible as they truly make the game

Perhaps my favourite two player abstracts. I think I'd still like it as much without the gorgeous components, games don't seem to run long and you can play serial games back to back. Haven't even tried out the power cards yet, haven't felt the need to after about twenty plays, which bodes really well. Definitely recommended. Interested to try with more than two.

Very easy game to teach and extremely enjoyable. Loads of replay-ability with all the gods available and i'm sure there will be more. Some of the gods can seem a bit on the strong side though. I'll have to keep playing to learn how they are countered.

RATING: 8.5
This is a really fantastic abstract game.  It's teachable in a matter of minutes and challenging for anyone.  Add in the hero/god powers and every game will feel very different.  In order to get the full experience, do not dismiss any of the powers being better or worse than the others.  If you go in open-minded, every game will be interesting.  Highly recommend this for anyone.

Really nice production with the plastic pieces and raised island.  Good artwork and presentation style also.  The cards are large and quite soft/bendy, which is weird because they are a bit thick too.   Quality could have been better there.   The 2p version is good - there is enough forward thinking and many times you can see how the game will end and you need to figure out how to stop it.   The fact that you have two pawns is crucial to the gameplay.    It plays very quickly, which is nice.   The gameplay isn't all that captivating, however.   I think Onitama is a better game in this range, but this one is certainly nice to have.

NOTE: I am not interested in any trades where my end is only this game like I keep getting offers for. It's not worth the shipping. Furthermore, I am not looking to dump it for a stack of low wants. I am only interested in this in a multi-game deal and only if the other end involves one of my high wants.

2017-02-28 : The game got explained and my wife started laughing - when questioned she said "Eddy is going to lose this one so badly it won't be funny" - and she was right - I suck at 3D abstract stuff and this is in essence a 3D abstract strategy game with beautiful components and has that abstract game winning combo of having very simple rules and emerging deep strategy and tactics. So while I won't ever win a game of this in my life, you can put it on the table and I'll gladly play.

Santorini is the least abstract looking abstract game I've ever played. At least, if we're talking about the new Roxley edition of the game. Which I am. This is a perfect information abstract with no luck. If you're using the player powers that come with the game, there could potentially be luck if you're randomly dealing out powers. While a good abstract game has large replay value, it's these player powers that have really elevated the game's variability. There are a ton of player powers and even more if you acquire the expansion. It's also nice that Roxley has designated the player powers as Easier and More Difficult. They even took the care to list some banned match-ups. All that being said, these powers aren't completely balanced. On the plus side, you don't have to play using the player powers to play the game. Unfortunately, since this is an abstract strategy game instead of a euro, you can't auction the player powers with VP. I'm sure this game is going to end up being a classic, but abstract strategy games don't tend to be my bag. I'm glad I got to try it, however.

I admit I was also taken in by the gorgeous look of a game that I normally would not give a second look. The artwork and fantastic board helped me get past the fact the game is just another run-of-the-mill abstract, which have never held my interest. I get the tactical depth of these game, I just never have the patience or skill to plan a move with any foresight. Those who can will crush me every time. The added player powers are a great addition in theory, but are lost on casual players like myself.

Everyone ought to play it once and chess minded people should buy it.

It has that Torres feel without that Torres AP.  Games are much quicker.  Rules are easier.  I'm not saying it should replace Torres by any means.  Sometimes I really want that.  But this is great for filling in that gap that I didn't even know existed till I tried it out.

Absolutely love this game.  Simple setup,easy to learn.  Each play is different from the last.  Have played with God's and  without.  The god powers add a huge amount of replay ability because of the way that the differnt powers change the way you and your opponents approach the game.  the expansion adds even more gods and options.  Will happily share this game with friends and family.  Components are amazing and durable. The art is family friendly, and each power is very unique to the god/hero. An all around amazing game. A must have for any collection

RATING: 7
Santorini is a joyously puzzling abstract game. Most open information games have a tendency to feel as if the loser lost (by making a poor move) rather than the winner won. Santorini avoids this key pitfall. As such, Santorini is more about forcing your opponent into suboptimal moves, and exploiting their predicted movement to achieve victory. The rules are unbelievably short, especially for a game with such crunch moment, and the God cards add delightful new wrinkles to each game. A great game to explore, especially if you play against the same opponent each time.

We've haven't busted it out with the kids yet, but this has all the trappings of an instant classic that the whole family will enjoy.  It's easy to teach, quick playing, totally addictive, and has tons of depth.

EDIT:  Yeah, the kids love it too.. a total keeper!

Very impressed with this game so far - fantastically fun.  Really solid abstract strategy game, with no luck and lots plenty of spatial calculation, plus interesting special powers  to add variety and appeal to the younger age set.  The Greek Mythology theme is a big plus (particularly for my 10-year old), and the bits and artwork are attractive (I have the Target version).  Big hit with everyone in the family, which is saying a lot.  I think I like it at least as well as Hey, That's My Fish, and most of the others probably like it better.

Rating based on a couple of 3 player games.  I have been told this game works much better as a 2 player game.  The 3 player game did seem a little chaotic to me but was still serviceable.  Some of the "god" powers seemed a fair amount better than others which messes with the balance of the game. Conceptually I like it though and the pieces and art are high quality.  Would like to play again soon to see how much better the 2 player game is.

Basically like 3D Connect-4, which is why I assumed I wouldn’t like this game much. I was wrong; I really enjoy it and I’m not that bad at it. I can see how the Gods & Heroes cards keep things fresh; you start to get good at the vanilla version, then adding special powers means having to rethink the moves based on both what you can do and what your opponent can do.

Best for 2 players.
Perfect for 2-3 games over lunch.

I enjoyed this quite a bit.  It is super short, so the power cards are a must, although the icons on them don't always match what your power is, so you'll need to keep the rules handy.

This is a game where usually someone makes an error in moving and the other player can take advantage and you'll both know 1-2 turns in advance who has won.

Cons:
- I'm not a fan of the giant-headed baby art.
- Way overproduced, what with the raised board and everything.
- *** DO NOT PLAY with 3, it ends up being a race to lock people in so they can't move rather than jumping up to the highest level

The core of the game is a very basic and simple abstract game, where the goal is to essentially block out your opponents in order to give yourself room to complete the win condition, while at the same time outpacing and stymieing your opponent so they can't do the same.  It can truly be taught in 30 seconds.

However, what makes this game a masterpiece of an abstract game is the god cards.  They add such variability that each game, with its own combination of god cards, is like a new game with new rules and strategies.  Absolutely fantastic.

Szép kivitelezés, szuper egyszerű szabályok, jópofa játékmenet. Tipikus kétfős absztrakt, szinte sakk. Emiatt nem is annyira nekem való, de azért jól elszórakoztam vele. A pontszám sokkal magasabb is lehetne, ha nem állna távol tőlem a stílus.

Tried several times and doesn't hold my attention. 

The 3D pieces are cool but the gameplay isn't that exciting; even though it can be varied greatly.

It feels like *too* much variability with the god cards; the rules change too much each game. I'd prefer something I can dig into.

Nice , quick abstract game. The "god" powers give a ton of variability in the game. Each power brings a new "rule" breaker to the game. Nice components. Another nice idea is to have the experienced player not have a "god" power while the newbie has won.

I think that Santorini is a good game, but neither my husband nor I enjoyed it. The mechanisms are simple to learn, and we saw how the tactics could be interesting to try. However, we felt more and more constricted in our choices as the game progressed, and we did not like that feeling. We also could tell far in advance who would win, and that was not fun for either of us. We much prefer Torres, a similar game that keeps us both engaged until the end. 

The Spin Master edition is pretty, but a piece was missing from my copy. Their customer service was somewhat frustrating to deal with and ultimately ineffective. I ended up returning the game to the store where I bought it.

RATING: 6.5
6 games so far.  Feels very abstract and chess-like, which isn't a great thing for us.  We enjoy theme and visuals.  We both agree that for this game to win us over, we will have to focus on it and play it over and over again for a few weeks... which may not happen.  We'll see.  At least it's quick and light.

UPDATE after 10 plays: We really put an effort in to find something in this game to woo us, but I think we've learned we aren't fans of abstract strategy, which is somewhat odd because we both enjoy Taluva a lot more than this.  I think it has something to do with the feeling of ownership at the end of the game as you survey the things that *you* built, that are *yours*.  In any case, this one is up for sale / trade.

RATING: 7
Components: simply amazing
Complex: easy to learn
Weight: light, could go to medium with cards
Players: 2
Length: 30 mins or less
Mechanics: area control? you need to control one tower
Decisions: where to move, where to build... a lot in this game
Opinion: I would define this as an 3D chess, you have to build towers and get your pawn to a 3 level one. Easy to achieve at first glance, but your opponent also building and blocking you makes the goal not so easy.
With its aesthetic the game is really enjoyable, the gameplay is good, couldn't say the opposite, but is missing something for me, cannot say exactly what, but a comparison with Torres is obvious, and for me Torres is the winner

RATING: 9
If you squint, this game is in the same family as Amazons, Hey That's My Fish, Battle Sheep, etc. The difference (and it's a huge one) is that instead of a 'used' space being blocked forever, it becomes part of a new game board one level up, until a space has been built in four times and it becomes impassable.

The win condition (get one of your pieces up to the third level) seems like it should also make a big difference. But in my limited experience, because it's so easy for a nearby enemy piece to thwart possible wins, you still more or less want to wall off your opponent, and you want to do it with you on the more valuable side of the wall.

Well, okay, the other big difference is the asymmetric powers, which is why I was so keen to try this even before realizing how much it had in common with Amazons. Initial impression: They matter a lot, which is the type of asymmetry I like.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Simple rule set with lots of depth, pretty ideal for an abstract. The gods do an excellent job of pushing the games depth into the sweet spot of competitive complexity for me while keeping replayability high. 

Has less "impact" on a move by move basis than Hive so it's a bit less satisfying during the game, and hasn't quite dug itself in yet but we'll see.

Good abstract with beautiful plastic buildings and (absolutely superfluous) island base. The three-player game is interesting but can easily end in kingmaking or without the primary winning condition being achieved. So, the game seems better suitable for two players. I haven't played with god powers yet, but I see how they can change the game and increase replayability, assuming they are well balanced. What I don't understand is why the publisher decided for childish and cutesy artwork and builder miniatures.

„Fehér épületek labirintusa”
A 2-4 fő részére kikapcsolódást nyújtó játékban egy 5x5-ös táblán (Santorini szigetén) kötelező jelleggel mozgatjuk egyik munkásunkat, majd kötelezően építünk vele, tudod, azokat a szép fehér „szantorini” házakat (mind le, fel és átlósan tudunk mozogni és építeni, de csak olyan helyekre, amelyen másik játékos munkása nem található). Az épületek maximum 3 emeletből, blokkból állhatnak és egy kupolából.
Az a játékos, aki egyik munkásával egy épület 3. szintjére tud lépni, megnyeri a játékot, illetve ha nem tudja kötelező lépését és építését végrehajtani elveszti a játékot.
Egyszerűek, gyorsan elsajátíthatóak a szabályok, sőt maga a játék is gyorsan „pörög”.
A játékot, egyben a fenti mozgás-építés kombót a „gém” kezdetén kiválasztásra kerülő istenek képességei teszik igazán élvezhetővé. Jó sok van belőlük, az újrajátszhatóságra sem lesz panasz. A képességek egy része erősebbnek-gyengébbnek tűnhet, de a játék rövidsége miatt a következő partiban, majd jól kicserélik a játékosok az istenek lapjait és jöhet is a visszavágó.
A képességek mellett munkásod pozíciójával tudsz taktikázni, hiszen oda nem mozoghat és építhet senki, amíg ott vagy.
A játék nekem nagyon tetszett, azonban elképesztően túlárazott. Ezt sajnálom, hiszen egy korrekt játék juthatna több ember kezébe, ha annak árszabása kedvezőbb lenne.
Kipróbálni mindenképpen érdemes.

Elegant two-player abstract game.  Most of the gods seem to be balanced - there are a few that may need to be restricted because they are too strong (i.e. only let younger gamers play with them). The components themselves and the table presence bumps this up a rating point for me.  Played it 3 player, and it's too chaotic for my tastes, so I'll stick to 2 player.

What an amazing game!  The base mechanics are simple to learn and offer a chess-like experience all by themselves.  Throw in the "god power" cards and the game is blown wide open to all sorts of strategy.

One key rule to note is that the "god powers" are not intended to be drawn at random.  One player should select the powers to be used that game (the other player getting to choose which power to use first).  This is a big component of the pre-game strategy keeping the players guessing at what strategy the other may be shooting for.  Also not drawing at random prevents combinations of powers that are not fun.

The game does support three players but its more of a minor feature than a main attraction.  The game is best suited for two players.

Great game for kids 8+ and equally great for adults.  My 8 year old loves this game and is good at it.  For adults, the depth level increases greatly when playing against an adroit planner.  It is a beautiful looking game, once the towers start building up.  I especially enjoy rotating the game base, to see the possible moves from different vantage points.  When you do this, the island looks like a different place and is quite nice.

Everyone was going on about how great this game was, so I had to try it. And yeah, there are a lot of cool options to try with the God powers and such, but in the end I wasn't that excited by my plays of this. It's good for a short match or two, but maybe because I'm not all that into 2-player "classic strategy"-type games, I just didn't ever feel very satisfied by playing it; the experience felt empty. With many other games, playing them can make one feel "filled up", or like they "scratched an itch", but Santorini had none of that for me. I would play again if prompted, but I have virtually no impulse to do so.

KS group buy.

Santori is an excellent 2 and even 3 player game. It strikes a nice balance between the depth of Go and the rote mechanics of Chess. The new version looks beautiful. I have not tried the God powers. The one downside is that you'll often reach the end before completing the actual objective. The 'checkmates' in Santorini almost always seem like a result of one player's mistake, rather than another's cunning.

Wow this is an amazingly simple, yet deep abstract game. Very clever design, simple rules, and easy to integrate unique powers, so every game will feel different than the last. Games are quick, yet the tactics and strategy are present from the get-go. Also let's not forget the game is beautifully produced and has some great artwork. I have not tried the Golden Fleece expansion, but it is on my wishlist. I can see this one becoming a classic like Yinsh, Patchwork, and even Chess

Have played mostly as a two player game, with one game at 4. At 4 players it becomes a 2 vs 2. It's okay, better than the sum of its parts. The game truly shines as a two-player outing though, but the 4 player works well enough. I think 3 might be better,but have yet to try it

You know those types of games - the ones that look nice and have straightforward rules that seem maybe too simple and you start playing and pretty much immediately you think 'ahhhhh, I SEE' and it's a total joy from the first move and you love it immediately? THIS. And it just gets better and better, as the more you play the more opportunities you see and the deeper it gets and the more you love it. And it gets really addictive and you sit and think about wanting to play it when you're not playing it. And that's before you even start using the God cards, because when THEY come into play... Man oh man. Just get it, it's wonderful.

It's definitely the best 2 player game I've ever played. Abstract and fast. Simple but deep. And it's so much fun. I can't stop smiling while playing this game :)
That's a 10!

Edit: 
Playing with gods: More fun and shorter games.
Playing without gods: A strategical masterpiece.

I have only had this game for about 3 days and can already tell it'll be a winner for my wife and I. Fun, simple rules that has the complexity of chess. Still learning the intricacies of the strategy, which is why the ""Move-counter-move-counter" we're doing right now knocks it down to a 8. But we have yet to add in God powers, so we have much to discover!

2/2018: After adding God powers, it’s plain how much extra they add. We tried some of the basics and it really changes up the strategy to becoming less off a standoff. Some combos may be unbalanced but that’s ok!

RATING: 6.5
The only issue that keeps me from giving it a higher rating is the fact that the beginning of the game and large part of the midgame is meaningless and full of just-correct moves of no consequence (neither a short-term nor a long-term one).  A way too much time passes before the players can sink their teeth into manoeuvring that _matters_.

If the above time can be cut (with experience) and there's much fun with diffrent gods (to determine that I'd need to get several more plays under my belt) I might be inclined to buy the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
An incredibly tight abstract with essentially two rules: move a guy then build. The base game becomes a match of boxing your opponent in or forcing them to choose between two options that would win you the game. The god cards are surprisingly well designed. Rather than breaking the game, they add exceptions to the two rules which open up to dynamic play styles. I've yet to see a combination I would say trumps another.

A lot of content in this package. Recommend wholeheartedly for any age or experience.

base game without the powers is very playable -- easy to pick up and still a lot of strategy.

adding in the powers just felt completely broken. many do not go well together, leaving the dynamic feeling quite lopsided.

rated 'will play if in the mood', but really it's more like 'will play if other players are down to skip the poorly balanced powers.'

The base game is really good, even though it isn't the deepest abstract around. 

With the god powers, it becomes a kind of compilation of related games, like Pyramid Arcade almost. None of these variants are, individually, much deeper than the base game, but the variety is amazing.

I think that's probably why Santorini is so popular on BGG and related sites. It appeals to people who want a wide variety of experiences rather than people who want to deeply analyze a single game. That group includes me, so I like it a lot.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (June 2017)

I was very keen to play Santorini, it is one of the few games that my SO played months before me and she loves it. She thinks it is gorgeous and the gameplay very exciting. After playing it, I have to agree with her.

The rules of the game are very simple, you can explain them under 2 minutes. Playtime is very short as well. I have had plays that ended under 8 minutes and others that ended under 20 minutes, still, a very short amount of time for such a deep game.

The game´s component are very well done, they look great on the board. The art is simply amazing.

Gameplays is very fun and fulfilling. The goal is to move one of your pieces (you have two) to the third level. Each turn you must move one of your pieces and then build a building with it., that’s it. It seems very simple, but the game has a lot of depth, which piece to move, where to move it and where to build is not obvious and if your opponent is very good you can think as deep as you like, however, you can also keep it light and fast. 

Santorini comes with a lot of god cards and each one impacts the game differently adding a huge replayability factor to the game. Each cards adds or breaks a rule to the game and I´m not sure if all matches are fair, but I don’t care much about it as the playtime is so short, so far, we had had problems with Morpheus only. In general, I love the variable powers, it is an staple of many of my favorite games.

Best with 2 players. I refuse to play it with 3 players as I really hate the king making situation that arises from this configuration, but I would play it with 4 players in teams.

After the setup (random gods), there is no luck whatsoever in the game, a huge plus for me. 

I have two minor issue with the game. After I read the rules I realized there was an app for the game so I spent the next 10 minutes looking for it. As it turned out, the app isn’t available yet so I think it is a mistake to include it in the rulebook. Another thing I dislike is that the rulebook of the game includes all the gods, even the ones from the expansion (Santorini: Golden Fleece) and we didn’t have access to them. They should come with the expansion, not with the base game, still, this is a very minor issue. 

The original game was released on 2004, I’m not sure if the game has any changes rules wise, but the art and components of the game sure did. I generally don’t mind if the game is ugly, as long as the gameplay is satisfying, but I’m very glad to see the new edition of the game, it is gorgeous. 
 
Bottom line, Santorini is a great family game, but it is also a great strategy abstract game. Not a lot of games can claim to be both. It plays very fast, but the decisions can be as deep as you want them to be. It has a huge replayability factor. Santorini is a must have for me. I´m a little sad that I gave my copy away and then I couldn’t buy it again because it was out of stock. I hope they reprint it soon. With more plays, I think it can get an improved rating from me. My desire to play the game again is very high.

- Great abstract game. Best with 2 players.
- Rules are super simple, the game looks great, plays quick, and setup/tear-down is quick.
- Standard game is good, but the very different player powers really elevate this. Introduce these as early as possible - probably the 2nd/3rd game.
- With 2 players, and the player powers, this can be very addictive as games play quickly and can feel quite different depending on the combination of player powers.
- Haven't played this yet with the golden fleece or one-time use powers, but I don't really care. There's so much in the base game plus player powers that I'm really enjoying it as is.

Really enjoying this beautiful game. So simple as the rules are basically move to any space around you that is unoccupied by another player, then build one pice of a tower in any unoccupied space (by another player). You can move up one level max but move down any number of levels. 
What blows this fame wide open though is all the god cards with the small rule changes that are unic to you. 
This game is simple enough to play with my 5 year old and yet tactical enough to enjoy a deeper game with true gamers. The games are quick and playing once is just not an option ;) great game and did I mention beautiful :)

RATING: 9
I owned and occasionally enjoyed the old version for years, which I had rated an "8". Santorini is a very tactical abstract where players control two pawns, and each turn chooses one to move and build. The first player to have a pawn ascend to the top of a three level tower, before the other player can cap it, wins. The game is about maneuvering your pawns and building in such a way as to block the other player so they cannot prevent you from a winning move.

The base game is quite engaging, but I would describe it as more crafty than deep or strategic. The game comes with optional cards that give each player a unique ability, exponentially increasing the replayability. Every different pair of cards used in a given game creates an entirely different experience. The new production with plastic towers infuses a fundamentally themeless game with lots of character. 

When my 9-year-old daughter learned this game, she didn't want to stop playing. My wife is both enamored and challenged by it. Truly a game that appeals to just about everyone who doesn't absolutely hate abstracts. I can't see this ever leaving my collection.

Love it.   A "thematic abstract," if such a thing were ever to exist.

The game is quite good without the God cards, and even better with them (even though certain combinations may be more unbalanced than others).  

Simply a beautiful display, wonderful art, emergent gameplay.  This is everything I want in a quicker game. 

Honestly not sure how this could be better.  Will consider giving this a 10 if it continues to hold up over time.

The game looks stunning and is very well made. The 2 player base game without god powers feels like an intricate game of cat and mouse. You are constantly jockeying for position, using completed buildings as barriers. Feels a little like a 3d tic-tac-toe. 

God powers are not very balance but it is fun to play with them. Might have a house rule where you can only activate the power on, say, 3 different occasions.

A surprisingly fun, quick playing abstract game. I would never play it without the god powers, even with newbies. With only two actions (move & build) it is hard to anticipate its replayablity, but I have enjoyed it thus far.

A beautifully produced game, with wonderful artwork. The game itself is a 2 player abstract (that can support more players) which is fairly interesting, but really requires the special powers to shine.

One annoying downside to the game is that the cards have no text, which makes it extremely difficult to draft or randomize the powers. Players need to keep passing around the rulebook in order to understand the cards.

This game takes about 2 mins to learn but it offers sooo much in return.  The depth of the basic game is great and becomes harder with more people.  When you start adding in the different Gods and how they interact with eachother, provides so much replay value it's insane.  Even though this is an abstract game, it does have a strong theme and the components and artwork are the best in the abstract category and still higher end for all other categories.  I play this with my friends who are in their 30's, and I play this with my 6 year old, 8 year old and 12 year old.  Everyone I have played this with loves it and finds it highly addicting.

Mediocre abstract exercise that has a piece of genius in having two pieces per side with a move first, build then with your mover mechanism. Overall a dull and antagonistic experience that definitely shouldn't be played with four. Santorini is the Latin name of the said Greek Island and therefore having Greek gods roaming around makes zero sense. Golden Fleece rules in the box is also a "nice" nod towards players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is the kind of game I usually despise: spatial abstracts, where one player has to play follow up all game, denying the options of the other one until they set-up an unblockable move. I normally see no pleasure in those, but what makes Santorini interesting are the God powers. New actions, reactions, and winning conditions, which makes the games very different from one another. And all of them are STRONG. These are not "you get 1$ when X", these are game-breaking superpowers.

I've gotten about seven plays in with this game while writing this and expansion on the way.  Let me tell you the vanilla game is amazing.  If you ever want to whip a game out where it takes literally 2 seconds to setup, this is it.  You drop a guy on the board, the other players do the same, do that for one more round, and the game starts.

Once you get the game going, you can literally teach this game in 2 minutes TOPS!  Your very first game could be played and completed in 15 minutes!!!  Not that I like short games, but there is a LOT of action packed in this 15 minutes.

I thought this game would be rather light, but at the same time strategic.  It went WAY over expectations after even the first play.  There were many moves where you really had to sit and ponder how best to defend, and attack at the same time.  Keeping an eye out on other players so they don't run too far, but also how to secure your own victory.  This game had my friends asking for more with each play.  We wanted to stop at three to play other games, but no one wanted to stop after we all said "last game."  We're all full ground adults hovering around a board playing baby chess.  It's amazing.

As for the game's theme?  Are you kidding me?!?!?  Have you seen this game after a completed game?  It looks like a real city, and it's DIFFERENT every time!  My play group has the tendency to take pics after each game to remember our play, but this game is so photogenic after a complete game that it's uncanny.  The only thing I have to say though is the cards are of lesser quality than I would like, and my Target version does not have the ocean board.  However, for the price, I am not going to nit pick about it.

I don't know why you're still here reading this review, the game is amazing because it's perfect for people of all ages.  Easy to teach, and fast to play.  Yet it's enticing to garner repeated plays.  It has the perfect "just one more game" formula, and if that isn't a perfect 10 I don't know what is.

If I had to nit pick a game play thing, I would have to say that some people might not pick up the strategy as fast as others, as spacial games might not be their forte.  However, for those that play checkers or chess, this might be a new light game for them to play between matches.  I'm not much a chess guy, but this reminded me of any "tactics" video game, like Final Fantasy Tactics.  Hopping up and down buildings etc.  Either way, I'm rambling now.  I don't want to stop talking about this game because it's that good.  I'm probably going to gift this copy away, and try to get my hands on the ocean board version.  VERY GOOD GAME!

Mivel eléggé nagy lett a hájp a Santorini körül, csak kipróbáltam. A Six MaKing készletem tökéletesen alkalmas erre. :)

Furcsa, de valahogy az ilyen nagyon absztrakt játékoknál egyáltalán nem villanyoz fel az, hogy optikailag ennyire felturbózzák. Nincs bajom azzal, ha valakinek erre van szüksége, hogy élvezzen egy sima táblával és korongokkal is játszható játékot, de én azért jobban szeretem az egyszerűséget és eleganciát e téren.

Maga az alapjáték jó. Sőt, nagyon jó, simán 9-10 körüli pontszámot érdemel, kiváló stratégiai játék, igazán feszült és óvatos körök váltják egymást. Tényleg ideálisan letisztult szabályrendszerű, rövid játékidejű, egyszerű, de mély játék.

Persze ez manapság már nem elég a dicsőséghez, kell a sok-sok extra. Nos, az alapdobozban (nem KS) van 30 istenség kártya, ami mindenféle különleges képességgel ruházza fel a játékosokat, így, mondhatni, aszimmetrikussá válik. És ez itt valahogy nem tetszik. Az aszimmetrikusságot szeretem, de itt valahogy nem szimpatikus, szerintem ilyen formában inkább bosszantó, mint érdekes. Ha játszanám is kártyákkal, csak úgy, hogy mind a két fél ugyanazt a különleges képességet használhatja.

So far so 1970s chessboard abstract, but the cake-cutting God cards (one player picks two powerups, the other chooses who gets which) makes this shine as a series of quick, competitive puzzles, with some witty metaphors. I assume it starts to wear thin once you've played or read enough to know how different match-ups tend to play out, but I'd be happy to explore it to that point.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
First abstract game and it's definitely a good experience. It's an incredibly simple game but each game is completely different. God powers can seem overpowered, but once you get playing, you realize that most are pretty balanced. Games are typically 50-50 with who wins and you always realize why you lost. No elements of randomness (except God cards), and is all about strategy. Beautiful board and artwork as well. It's a great little game to get your mind warmed up. Really light game with really deep strategic elements.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Fast, simple, with a TON of nuance in the strategy you apply to each game. The various God Cards give each match a unique focus. 

Great game to play "best 2 out of 3", since the games rarely hit 20 minutes (at least not in my household).

Really feel like everyone is just cutting and pasting the same quote about this game for their ratings comment.  Some seem to not have even played it yet.  Or it's rated for beauty.  Yeah most abstract games look boring as hell and I suppose it's no different than all the CMON games that get 10s for beautiful minis...
Yes the game is pretty good but you definitely aren't going to like it past the first exploratory plays if your not an abstract fan.  There is far less to bridge that gap vs. say Patchwork.  Santorini has a lot of the back and forth that many despise about abstracts and a lot of chess like need to look ahead several moves at each and every possibility.  If that sounds like your thing then you'll be set with Santorini.  On the other hand imagine Chess if every game one of your pieces moved differently as did one of your opponents. Is that really infinite replay ability or just idiocracy? I don't pretend to know yet and I doubt anyone making those claims has played nearly enough to say for certain either. I do suspect the game is at least slightly overrated though I'm not debating it's a great game.
If your an abstract fan at all you basically have to buy the game if only to weigh in.  Otherwise it's like being a Star Wars fan and not having seen Rogue One.
Also, it probably goes without saying, but it's probably one of the most head turning games you will ever own.

1 partida en Juégame Store.

Tienes que conseguir ser el primero en subir al 3er piso de una torre y en tu turno TIENES que mover y construir (en ese orden). Y ya está, super sencillo de explicar.

+ Me encantan las ilustraciones, el tablero, los componentes y hasta la caja!
+ Muy fácil de explicar, para todos los públicos
+ Partidas cortas
+ Pese a su sencillez, tiene su estretegia
+ Muchísimas cartas que dan habilidades distintas para que cada partida sea diferente
+ Funciona bien a 3 jugadores (la partida que probé) y supongo que lo mejor será a 2
- Aunque el juego en sí es independiente del idioma, las reglas están en inglés
- El precio... para un juego tan sencillo pica gastarse 50 €, pero los componentes lo valen

Bardzo ładnie wydana gra doktora matematyki. Nowa edycja starej gry tego autora - wydana na kickstarterze.
Takie dwupionkowe warcaby z aspektem przestrzennym i zmieniającymi się zasadami w zależności od tego jakim bogom służą robotnicy (pionki/figurki). Urocze rysunki i bardzo staranne wykonanie elementów budynków które się stawia by wygrać. Lekka łatwa i przyjemna dla dzieci i dorosłych,  wymaga kombinowania i spostrzegawczości (jak w warcabach). GFP (teraz Games Factory) również wspominało o wydaniu po polsku - wystarczy przetłumaczyć instrukcję, bo poza nazwami nie ma innych tekstów na kartach bogów.

DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!

so I finally got the game. In short, it disappoints. Yes to play it once is nice, but have someone else get the game for you.

(-) the plastic smells of poisonous PVC. Great for your kids..
(-) it feels like chess, or that hex bug game. I'd rather play those.
(-) god effects are very hard to understand, and I'm not stupid or anything. The basic gods are okay-ish but the advanced god powers are indecipherable.
(-) board quality weak, easily cracked. Plastic bags are bad, and already damaged after one play. God cards are too big and look bland, contrary to video impressions. I got the roxley version  The underlying big tile is missing. DO NOT BUY THE ROXLEY VERSION! It is too American: "bigger is better" but here bigger gave pixelated cards, and too big house pieces. Also there is no "relief", i.e. the houses slide off easily.
(-) island map does not scale. It should be made scalable to account for 2-3-4.

Now for availability and 
very hard to find in Europe, and very high price. Total cost me $65.
In itself not a problem but it is very unclear what you get what heroes are included what gods are excluded, promos or not. 
-1 Also the booklet was a ks exclusive. A shame it is not included.
-1 for having to print the omitted gods myself.
-1 for not being scalable. The back should include a smaller field.

Santorini is an accessible strategy game, simple enough for an elementary school classroom while aiming to provide gameplay depth and content for hardcore gamers to explore, The rules are simple. Each turn consists of 2 steps:

1. Move - move one of your builders into a neighboring space. You may move your Builder Pawn on the same level, step-up one level, or step down any number of levels.

2. Build - Then construct a building level adjacent to the builder you moved. When building on top of the third level, place a dome instead, removing that space from play.

Winning the game - If either of your builders reaches the third level, you win.

I originally saw this on Kickstarter and ended up passing on it.  Thank goodness it was successful enough to get picked up and mass produced post-Kickstarter.  This game is F-U-N!  The rulebook is crystal clear explaining the god card abilities, though it could do a better job on clarifying how to start the game.  A player has two pawns.  Do you place one on the board, then your opponent places theirs then you place your final pawn?  Do you place both of yours followed by your opponent placing both of theirs?  

Other than that, this game is rock star!  Very simple rules but almost has this checker/chess-like strategy to it where piece placement becomes crucial.  Once a few building bases have been laid down, strategy vividly surfaces as you begin to determine which method of victory is best pursued...box your opponent in or climb your pawn upwards to the third level of a building?  The component quality is very good and the artwork is enjoyable and fits the theme nicely.  All in all, I love this game, an absolute gem that I expect to see on a lot of "top 10" lists for 2017 games.

Initial Impressions: I wonder if the in my opinion gaudy plastic pieces actually made me feel less thematically inmersed, as they created the expectation that mechanisms would have more of a surface level theme as in Hive or Tigris & Euphrates. 

I can't exactly place my finger on it, but Santorini just felt kind of dull even if it is clever. If I had to guess I would say maybe there isn't really an arc to the game. In Go the board gradually fills up, in Chess pieces are removed. Here, the levels get higher, but somehow it doesn't feel like I am gradually building up to something. It just feels like every move is the same even if it is actully tactically different.

There are a lot of different abilities, but while I'm sure they change tactics a lot the ones in my game didn't really excite me at all, and so I have no desire to try new ones.

A fan of the old PnP of Santorini, have followed it up for a while. I am totally glad that  KS offered the original creator the opportunity to thrive on this.

I can barely feel the depth of this game, I am all exited about it. I have no idea how it plays with the awesome characters they have developed, but I can have some taste from the beautiful math/logic problems they´ve added to the KS updates.

Congratulations, this is looking real good...

There are so many Gods to choose from too, each with seamingly unique and interesting abilities. Can't wait to try them all :)

Santorini is an abstract game that plays very quickly with beautiful components by Roxley Games. The high price isn't necessary, wooden components would have been fine but the production is really nice. All god cards add to replayability.

Truly lovely, my whole family loves this game (we haven't even started into God Powers).  My five-year old boys love playing this and are rather adept at blocking since the rules are very simple.  It's harder for them to strategize and win, but they'll keep you on your toes!

The components really look fabulous, and the little santorini you have build after the game ends always looks very sexy. 
The game itself is very abstract and requires experience to win. With the  gods expansion the game probably (?) offers enough variation to keep it interesting for a while. Gameplay doesn't really feel very original and must have been implemented before. 

Minus: 3 (replayability?) - 5 - 6

Extremely simple gameplay and quick play time.  The god cards add a ton to the game - require you to consider new possibilities based on the god you have compared to your opponent's god.  I feel like that adds an extra layer of depth to the game.  Beautiful game!

RATING: 7
What can be more simple than two rules. Move and build. Very easy to learn and difficult to play well. You have to outthink your opponent and see a turn or two ahead of them. The components are ridiculously cool and the game looks incredible. Great art work, easy and fun to play. This is a must have for a game collection.

I wish the rules were a bit more thorough with each of the God Powers.  They really should have thought of these clarifying questions that everyone is having to go online for and just included a couple more sentences for each one.  Having said that I really love this game!  The components and art are fantastic.  The gameplay is awesome, and makes for a great addition to my collection of 2-player abstract strategy games!

RATING: 8
Potentially the most beautiful abstract strategy game.  The game is so simple, with the god cards only adding a minor complication.  My one issue is the need to make sure the god cards chosen do not contraindicate each other.  Also, terrible at three (one player will have to choose who they let win) and don't call it a four player game if people have to play on teams.

An okay abstract, not really very interesting but fun for a quick change. I dislike the game being overproduced though, this kind of game should just be simple wooden blocks or something, the plastic and floating island idea look cheapish and make it more annoying to play as you need the right piece to stack.

RATING: 8
Sumptuously produced, easy to learn and teach, and fun to play. Solid! Feels like a good abstract without powers, so I can't wait to see how it changes when they're in the mix.

The basic game has a unique flavor, particularly with both players having two pieces each, and both pieces being powerful. They can be foils, drivers, engines, blockers, pushers, bluffs -- there's a lot going on. It has that "one more game!" quality that I look for in abstracts, and I'm thinking about strategies after our first session (also a good sign).

It's nice to see a vibrant, cartoony abstract, too. I love my understated, theme-free abstracts, but I can get behind one that does its own thing, too.

Three games is enough to see its potential, but not enough to go above an 8. Each game ran slightly longer than the one before, which is good; I suspect subsequent games will slingshot back in the other direction.

---

Played a couple games with three, and with god powers, and it's a different experience. It felt almost like managing six games, one per pawn, and there was a psychological element in guessing whether or not you could count on another player to stop the third (etc.).

It also highlighted just how much variety is in the core box: at least two dozen gods we haven't tried yet, plus the Golden Fleece, makes for a lot of longevity.

+ Golden Fleece expansion (unplayed)

Rating based on 2 players.

I haven't even played with the god powers yet, but I really enjoy this and am always up for a game. It's extremely easy to teach, plays quickly but still requires a good amount of thought and planning, and it looks terrific. An abstract game like this doesn't really *need* all the plastic components, but it draws people in, and constructing the little buildings feels nicely satisfying. I think the constructive nature of the gameplay also negates some of the stress I sometimes get when I play perfect information games. It packs a lot of punch in a short time!

When you open the box and start putting the white pieces on the 3d island the game looks gorgeous. I think that this production deserves a 10. No doubt. Super game, super components and super beautiful artwork of the cards. Thanks Roxley for such a gem!

An amazing 2-player game of whits, where you attempt to build a town 3 stories high and walk to the top. It's short, but reach in strategy. Like chess you must think ahead 4 turns while contemplating your opponents moves too.

Wow, with some exciting artwork, theme, and stunning presentation, Santorini breathes new life into a category of games that is generally very boring, Abstract Strategy. The mechanics are very simple, and the different character cards add variety to the game by breaking the base rules somehow. But this really is only a filler to me.

At first glance the overproduced nature of this game might give the impression that it's over complicated, however this couldn't be further from the truth. The mechanics are as simple as they come with the option for adding more 'gamer' elements in the form of awesome player powers, and the overproduced nature just makes it look more spectacular on the table.

This is quite a good game actually. Abstract game of moving and building, trying to get to the third level and win. The game has 45 different role cards of which each player only has one. These roles have very strong special powers and vary a lot. Much replayability I assume. The price however, is way too high for the short and quick game it is.

RATING: 8
Extremely simple to learn and play, yet it has immense depth and tons of interesting interactions with the various god powers. It plays best with two players but I had played with the 3 and 4 player modes and they work well.

I like that it has various difficulty modes as well. For non-boardgamers they can stick to Simple Gods. For infrequent or casual boardgamers there's the Advanced Gods to keep things interesting. For veterans that want to play with crazy stuffs, the Golden Fleece expansion (sell separately but is included in KS copies) comes with Gods that have board changing abilities and hidden death traps. Too much godly abilities to stomach? You can play with Heroes whose abilities are one time deals.

This is an extremely short game (15 minutes), so if you're looking for an adventure this is not for you. But if you're looking for something short, simple and yet challenging, few games do better than this.

The new edition looks amazing, and there are some really cool powers that will be included.  Here's what I wrote about the earlier edition:

Review: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/105873/divine-game
Read about my initial 3-player outing:
http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/91992

There are definitely interesting choices and tactics.  The gods cards present twists that should keep this game fresh.  The mental exercise is both challenging and aesthetically appealing.  Three players with gods powers is somewhat mind-bending to play in top form.  With two players and no gods (or the same gods for both players) the game is quite pure.  The godly powers are all interesting and every one seems `too powerful' while being fairly well-balanced against each other.

We were lucky and snagged a Kickstarter advance copy.  We really love this game!! It's fun and easy to learn.  A visually attractive game.  Lots of variety & strategy.  It scales up & down from 2, 3 or 4 players really well. My teenagers love that it is 3Dimensional and the MANY different diety cards really give a lot of variety & richness to the game play.

The best abstract to have in my collection, while probably not the best I've played. It has a huge amount of different rulesets (Gods) that can be combined, meaning that it offers thousands of completely different games on the very same mechanical base.

PROS
- Gorgeous. I'm not kidding. Incredibly beautiful.
- Family-friendly theme and art.
- REALLY easy to explain and understand.
- Insane amounts of replayability.
- Very solid mechanical base and interesting gameplay.

CONS
- The big box, meaning that it cannot be easily carried.

My initial impression of Santorini was that it was good, if somewhat simple, family-themed abstract. However, more plays has revealed that the game transcends those early impressions. While still relatively light and approachable, the game appears to have a deceptive level of depth. Furthermore, the addition of the god powers adds a wonderful level of asymmetry and replayability. In short, the game is a joy to play both casually and more competitively.

Fast purely abstract game - which is a genre I generally don't like that much - that my kids started to play first between themselves before joining for a game. The rules are easy enough for the kids to play the game and even my youngest gets what the consequences are of his movements. The god powers can be used to handicap adults against kids. We only scratched the surface with the god cards but this feels like it can hit the table a lot.

It's a great modern and easier chess-game. I'm in love with the graphic style and the figurines. The different levels for the building just fit per-fect-ly. Very nice and tidy.

And indeed you just need 30 seconds to be able to play; and THAT is the killer feature. To make a game that is so easy to learn, but that have good strategy / tactics layer, request great creative skills.

I definitely want to play again and try all of the gods cards / multi player to see how it goes (3 or 4 players). I guess the guess is best fit for 2 players.

As of now, Santorini in the best abstract game there is, in my humble opinion. This is exactly how you do an abstract game. The game play is tight and clean. It is easy to teach and even easier to understand. The tagline is as accurate as it can be. It truly takes under a minute to learn and a lifetime to puzzle out. The production value of this game is through the roof. True, you can still enjoy and play the game without the plastic cliff or without the detailed building blocks. But this attention to aesthetic is what elevates a great abstract game to a brilliant one. One of the downfall to an abstract game is that it is often dry. The 'cliff' and the 'blocks' satisfies your right brain while your left is engaged in the game. You are compelled to play again and again because it is just so beautiful to look at, you are willing to engage in the more thinky part of it. I will go as far to say that this is the best way to implement a 'theme' to an abstract game. It makes sense to build levels to buildings, it make sense you go up different stories and it makes sense you can't stand on a dome. And the illustrations by David Forest and Lina Cossette are some of the best I have ever seen on a board game. Right up there with Dutrait, Moriya and Naiiade. The cute and bright style just works. And I have to mention the God cards. What a smart way to keep the game fresh. Playing with any of these cards change the game play just enough for you to not be too comfortable with the same strategy and not to be bored by the same routine. This game really ticks all the boxes for an excellent abstract game for me. Tight game play, tick. Complex strategy but low bar of entry, tick. Interesting and elevating theme, tick. Good production value, tick. Beautiful art work, tick. Possible variability or expansion of game play,  tick. Do yourself a favor. Get a copy of this wonderful game.

Santorini - a brilliant 2 player abstract game where you move 2 pawns about a 3D board building structures with the aim of being the highest. If only I played 2 player games more often…

RATING: 9.5
This is an excellent abstract game.

Pure and simple without the god powers the game is a fun and quick strategy game. 

With the God Powers it starts to hit me in my soft spot for variable player powers and suddenly the game is flipped on it's head and every action is more intense.

RATING: 5.5
Overhyped and overproduced.  Not a bad abstract, but it's a bit too fiddly with the various overproduced bits to make it a favorite of mine.  The basic game is a bit too simplistic.  The cards help, but again, I don't think a good, solid abstract should require such enhancements to its basic gameplay.

What a lovely lovely game! I only played this twice (and with 4 players, which didn't feel ideal) but I can't stop thinking about it and would love to play it some more. Don't know how repetitive it will get after a while, even with all the powers.

First game may take a bit longer than the quoted 20 minutes, but other games do take about 20 minutes.  Very unique abstract in that it delivers such a big amount of abstract thinking in such a small time frame and simple rule set.

Decent abstract elevated by high production values. This gets a 5 with the basic rules, but a 6 with the god cards thrown in. The game itself is fine, but it gave me a similar feeling to tic-tac-toe. This isn't to say that the game doesn't have depth, but it definitely feels mostly like move, counter-move, etc.

The 3D aspect of the game was different to anything I've played and I had high hopes for the game. Played first game without the god/hero cards and it was OK but unexciting and finished quickly. Used the god/hero cards for other games but Atlas won by just blocking his way to victory in each game, hardly building anything. Some faint hope exists that I might try the game again at some point but so far it's been a disappointment.

Santorini is a very light abstract game that most people should be able to play quickly.  The look of the game on the table and the overall production quality will attract some rubbernecking too.

Attractive and very easy to teach abstract strategy game where you move workers and use them to build towers, with the goal of moving onto the top of a three-high tower. Looks great on the table and plays fast, but with surprising depth of tactics/strategy. You can also play with special powers that make the game more complex. The rules recommend playing two-player, but you can play three players with what's in the box (not sure why they didn't just include enough figures for four). Highly recommended for both gamers and non-gamers.

It's been awhile since I picked up a game and immediately wanted to play again. Granted, with shorter games this is much more likely. However, I love the look, the simplicity, but also the depth. I watched some friends make some incredibly smart decisions that had the rest of us watching go "oooooohhhhhhhh....." One of the best quick games I have ever played.

After many months of wondering if this game would be right for the two of us, we finally picked up a copy at our local Target.  Played 10 times in a row right out of the box!  Haven't played with the advanced Gods yet but quickly getting to that point.  Tried with 4 players and didn't like it as much, but 3 was good but harder. I think 2 is the sweet spot with this one.

The only downside is that the 3D spatial awareness required to play well means that experienced players will easily beat new players.

RATING: 9
[b]Theme: 4/5[/b] For an abstract, there is a theme, and that's generally enough for an abstract to be rated well for theme. I do think a victory condition about having the builders climb to the third floor is a little odd, but the different gods giving their workers special powers is interesting.

[b]Components: 4/5[/b] The workers aren't incredibly detailed, but that is completely made up for by the building pieces and the island board stand. This game looks really beautiful as the game progresses, and you can pretty much take a picture of every single end game board and it'll look nice. You don't even have to try. Some may complain about the artwork on the cards and box, but I honestly find it fine. I will admit, I'd prefer an extremely regal looking version of this game. Maybe the special edition looking box with the card artwork from the original game. However, this cartoony art helps it appeal to people. Obviously, from a marketing standpoint, that's a good thing, but it also makes it easy to convince friends to play it.

[b]Length: 5/5[/b] It's quick. Not much to say. This game will not last for a long time regardless of what happens. Yinsh and Kamisado are both abstracts that can sometimes feel like they take way longer than necessary. You will either achieve victory quickly by hopping on the third level, or by blocking the opponent in.

[b]Strategy: 4/5[/b] This game is very enjoyable, and the variants with the god cards allows you to think about each game a little differently depending on how the abilities interact with each other. However, the workers have A LOT of control over the board. You're generally going to end up having to trap a worker between buildings or on top of a building, and then you'll usually have to find a way to get a building completely separated from the opponents workers by a huge barricade of level two towers to have a chance to get your chance of victory.

[b]10 -- > 9[/b] Still a spectacular game, however, this strategy is not quite as tense as I like in some other abstracts (namely Yinsh).

This one is gonna be hard for me to rate to start. I've enjoyed all 7 of my plays thus far. But two of my games have been teaching games and three have been without god powers. I like the vanilla game, but I really want to explore the balance of the gods and see how each one plays differently. I love abstracts, and this is a really great addition. I want to see how high this one climbs with more plays and more exploration, so expect edits to this.

The best thing as of now is how easy it is to teach. Hands down the best part. Move, build, pass. Play a game or two with no powers. Then rock and roll with the powers.

I can see how the simple game has appeal for some people, but I'd rather play a game of noughts and crosses as it has as many "decisions" as this game.

An overproduced abstract game. It's one advantage is that it plays quick. May be worth it for a £20 game, but not worth it for a £50+ game.

Played  three times in a row the first time I played it, and eight times in a row the second time.

Santorini has elements of blocking and area control. The simple ruleset makes it accessible to less experienced players. Though I've only played a few times, replayability seems high as others report hundreds of plays. Nice when a game lives up to the hype.

Simpatico gioco astratto con componenti molto gradevoli. Si tratta in realtà della riedizione di un gioco per due giocatori. Il gioco permette diversi gradi di complessità, dalle partite con due regole per iniziare per poi crescere aggiungendo pezzi e varianti che rendono il gioco più articolato e avvincente. I materiali sono curati e attirano l'attenzione. Consiglio di provarlo, anche perché le partite durano pochi minuti.

For a short abstract game, this is a pretty good rating for me. At the start it feels like you're wandering around a bit, just trying different things, and then as the game develops shape, you see possibilities and develop a plan to win. I'm sure that point comes much earlier with mucho experience, as it feels like there's depth to the game. And yet it’s so simple. Turns are as fast as you want depending on if you're playing by feel or thinking options through. The beautiful components elevate the game. The god cards, providing special powers, extend the game's replayability rather dramatically, adding a layer of fun via each player testing one asymmetric power against another, and lifts the game to another level. It’s not a game I’ll seek, as it’s not a genre I seek, but I’ll enjoy playing it if someone’s keen.

4 plays - Obviously its very beautiful. However, some of the God Powers seemed broken or arduous on first few play-throughs. I suspect with the right God Power match-ups it is more fun, but couldn't be bothered sifting through them all (there's a lot!). The game play is nice, but not so interesting as to warrant a higher rating. A suspect the game play is made more interesting, by the fantastic pieces your manipulating to win.

A very simple abstract strategy game. You move and place pieces that stack together and your goal is to make it to the third level of a tower, however you can also build a fourth level to block your opponent from getting there. Cute but seems almost too​ simple and does not satisfy my abstract game itch as there are so many good ones out there.

Santorini is a two-player abstract game in which players are trying to build tower levels on a grid, and move their one of their two pawns to the top level of the tower before it gets capped by the other player. Tower levels can only be played adjacent to a pawn, and pawns can only move up or down one level at a time. Like all good two-player abstracts, this one is really about trying to control your opponent's moves while simultanously advancing toward victory. I'd say the game is overproduced, especially with the giant raised plastic gameboard that serves no purpose, but at no point did the production hinder gameplay. The game also includes a number of variants that I didn't try. I think this one succeeds as a two-player abstract, but my appetite for such games is not large.

Delightful game, and my best Kickstarter impulse-back so far. 
While I like many abstract games in theory, I find I get bored of them very quickly. This one completely solves that problem with all the god powers. 
After just one game I knew that this would end up in my top 10 and that I'll enjoy it for a long time to come. The beautiful production also helps. At a time when I'm getting slightly jaded by all the same old, same old games being released, this is an absolute treasure.

I like this abstract strategy game because it provides a fresh experience. Chess and Go are wonderful games, but they require a great deal of dedication to not only master, but remain competent. The types of abstract games I gravitate toward now are ones that provide unique challenges each time, because they challenge my problem solving skills more than my pattern recognition and memorization. The GodPowers cards in Santorini give players something like 30 asymmetrical powers that alter the way they move, battle, restrict, build, jump, build, climb and in some cases - alter the win conditions. So, with each game you find yourself thinking in terms of: "OK, how can my advantage be used against the competitor who has a different advantage" instead of: "OK, how do I respond to a Queen's Gambit?" 

Granted, this is a much much simpler game, but it has a familiar "pursuit & trap" feel that I've experienced in chess right at the very end of a game of attrition in which many pieces are gone and the game turns into a spatial cat & mouse pursuit.

This is very early on but I just played a half dozen games and I am very impressed with it.  It is a game that you can really feel has gears and the shortness of the games help mitigate the pain you feel when you make a mistake.  I haven't played with the gods yet but without the gods, it is already a tense game when played seriously.  I come from a chess background and I don't know how I would compare the two.  You do ry to work you combinations but it feels a little different.  I might compare the game more to Go but much shorter and with more cute moves.  I don't know if it is the best game but it is very good for a 10-20 minute game.  I am a big fan of Blokus, which is another abstract.  That game has gears ,too, when played competitively.  Santorini, I think has more variation and novel moves built into it.  Even when I lose, it still feels fun.  Especially, if my opponent saw a cute novel move to put me away.  How many games can you enjoy a move or combination that made you lose?  The game is fun in a way that makes you wonder why it sat on the workbench for so long before being published.

Abstract tile placement where you are trying to make it to the top of a 3 story building in Santorini. You are working to block your opponent from doing the same thing.

Genius game and I have been loving this game more and more with each play!

Santorini is a quick 2 player abstract game, where players compete to be the first to get their figure to stand at the third level of the fairly attractive pseudo-Grecian structure that gets communally built over the course of the game. On a players turn they move one space, the build one piece. Because diagonals are allowed and because your figure can build on an adjacent space regardless of the height of that space, it's really a game of keeping close to your opponent's pawns and be ready to block them by putting caps on third level spots. Each player also gets a player power that effects the game in some way, and I suppose this is where the game might shine with more familiarity. My wife found the game more frustrating than fun. I enjoyed it, but I'm not sure how I feel about it yet in relation to other similar feeling games like Torres, the Climbers or Taluva; none of which ultimately stayed in my collection.

Initial rating is really high for me. For games we enjoy on our first play, I normally start out at 7 to 8 and then adjust when the game proves to have some staying power. We've played Santorini 5 times so far and haven't even touched the God/Hero cards or the Golden Fleece variant. This one is going up in the ranks.

This game has the simplicity of a children's game in terms of rules, but great great depth.  My 4 games today each brought a sense of newness with each play.  This is a keeper.  I'm not a fan of 3 player because it seems like players are in danger of being forced into a kingmaking situation.  The more I play this the more I realize it's worth a ten.  Short game play, great decisions and the powers truly give it teeth.

I've only played the basic game so far.  Very tactical experience.  The game is all about making sure that you can 'shut down' certain building when you need to.  If they can block you out of an area, then they can win the game.

The special powers (many of which seem OP), should allow the game to stay fresh if you can get it to the table enough.

Santorini pushes the right buttons for me by presenting sound abstract gameplay mechanisms, but it ultimately felt underwhelming. I appreciate the elegance and overall accessibility of this game. Strangely, though, I never found my games very intriguing or exciting. The addition of god powers are almost a "must" for me in order to spice things up. This aspect of the game is enough to raise its rating a tad in my eyes, as it adds an element of depth for further "meta" exploration. It is a solid filler entry, if a bit overproduced.

(+) Elegant ruleset. Plays quickly. Bang out a couple of games in minutes at a time.
(+) Visually appealing.
(+) Accessible and highly re-playable.

(-) Lacks the competitive 'punch' I seek in head-to-head games.
(-) Overproduced and not really worth the admission price. I would almost prefer a simpler production that matches the elegance of the ruleset. (It appears newer printings circa September 2017 have adopted this).
(-) The gameplay feels shallow without god powers.

KS backer with white box and Golden Fleece expansion
After several play throughs this game very much fits a niche in my game collection as I hoped it would.  If you want a game that can be played in 10 - 20 minute sessions and yet be able to mix up for new playing strategies then this game is a must.  I envision it being set up at my gaming nights for people in between games who want something quick and focused, or a quiet night with a friend or two.
Pros
- Beautiful board that literally "stands" out
- Building pieces are a perfect fit and well worth the time they took to get right
- Takes only one play through to basically fully understand rules.
- God powers add tons of playability and completely changes strategy each time
- Breaking gods to simple and advanced allow for slowly adding more complex strategies
Cons
- While board is compact and small extra space is needed to store all the building pieces to the side when not yet in use.
- Honestly cannot think of anymore!  Need to try Golden Fleece expansion to further my experience of the game.

Definitely worthy of all the praise it's been given.

The abstract aspect of the game makes for a fantastic two player experience, but when using the god powers, I've had the most fun playing with four players in 2 teams. Doesn't play as well with three players, but I've definitely enjoyed playing with two/four people enough to make up for that.

I have now played this game with casual gamers, serious gamers, abstract lovers, and family- including wife and 13yr old daughter. Everyone has enjoyed it, and most have asked to play again. It looks extremely good on the table, attracting audiences most everywhere I've played. The broad appeal to this game can't be denied. The artwork is top notch, even if you don't like the style you have to appreciate the technical polish on it. It is probably the most approachable abstract game I've ever seen.

I was surprised that even the three player game seems to work really well, though I haven't played with four players, yet. The gameplay varies greatly from god power to god power... some games you find yourself playing defensively, some games playing quite aggressively, and others where you have a lot of subtle moving and shifting and sneaking around. With most abstracts, if I even get to this many plays (10+), I'm pretty much done with the game. I feel like I have barely scratched the surface of Santorini and am looking forward to playing with all 45 gods and the additional heroes.

Two 2-player games. Cleverly designed but somewhat over-produced game. The design of the cards suggests the publisher was hoping to appeal particularly to the 'young girls and infantilised adults who happen to like abstract games' market.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The pure abstract version is nice but doesn't grip me.  The special powers I find add a lot to the game.  They give direction to the the early game, which is much needed by the base game,   I also like judging how to play differently against different opposing gods, making the game feel more heuristic and less about simple brute force calculation.

update:  Indeed, the powers are not balanced but are a lot of fun.  A net gain.

update 2:  my 6-year old really likes playing with the god powers, and their imbalance works in our favor since they can be used as a handicap system.

for strategy gamers:  7/10
for geeky families:  8/10

Given this is effectively an abstract game with very nice components it's stunning how often I pull it out and no-one seems to care that's it's actually a very cutthroat game. I don't mean that in a bad way, in fact given the average play time of under 10 minutes and the fact that all information is open it's a VERY good game. With the variety of gods to mix together and I can see myself playing this game in 50 years time and still enjoying it just as much then as now.

this abstract game is not the smallest or most portable. actually, it's quite a big package for something you'd maybe expect to want to pull out at lunch. no, it's gone in the other direction: advertising itself, taking up space, and shouting for replays. this game is fun to play! with an inviting table presence and interesting asymmetric powers it's not hard to get a someone to play a first and a second round. easy to learn, tricky to play smart. i also really adore the game Tak, although a friend explained to me that i win Santorini more often because i can more quickly adapt to the new god card every round. i guess that appeals to my cult-of-the-new side, but honestly i see this game sticking around for a long, long time.

:thumbsup: Gorgeous graphic design and components!
:thumbsup: The bare bones version of the game is so easy to explain, yets offers such tactical depth.
:thumbsup: Built-in layers of complexity: if you grow tired of the basic game, you can gradually add in the different tiers of [i]God powers[/i].
:thumbsup: [i]God powers[/i] can serve as an equalizer for less experienced players by having them draw one while their opponent plays without one.
:thumbsup: Doesn't take up too much table space, which makes it an ideal travelling game. I had my copy with me when I was hospitalized for three weeks and played on the small bedside table there.

One of the most beautiful abstract games I have seen so far. Huge if not infinite replayability due to the large number of gods. Every god plays different ... partially completely against the basic rules. I enjoy it very much and can't wait to test different combinations of gods.
One thing I have to mention about the recommended number of players: two is the sweetspot, definitely!

Wow, just wow. This could be the perfect abstract strategy game, if it wasn't for the huge box! If there was a cute travel version, I'd snap that up and probably replace my original copy as it's a bit of pain, when it doesn't need all that extra "wow". But otherwise it's a very solid simple abstract game that I love!

A simple game with two actions, the first being move and the second is to build.  As the game progresses upon the cliffs of Santorini, the white buildings grow up to the tips of their blue domes!

This game is packed with replayability, and is both memorable and fun!

Santorini is a blast! I'm not a fan of all of the Gods; some of them are a little annoying and a few stretch the game out far beyond its welcome. But, otherwise, I like the game a lot. I own the expansion (Golden Fleece), but have yet to actually play it yet. Looking forward to trying it.

I'm rating Santorini following about 40 plays with mostly 2 players, but also a handful of 3 player matches over the past few months. Picked this up the day it became available on MM as I was not aware of the KS edition so mine did not come with the Golden Fleece expansion, but we loved the game so much we added it once it was available retail. The 3 player game can be a bit unstructured and unbalanced depending upon which God powers are in play, but we really appreciate this option as opposed to merely being a strict 2 person abstract strategy game like Chess. Certainly some of the God powers are more impactful than others which if drawn randomly can radically imbalance the game. However, I think that's the designers point to have disparate powers to level the playing field when both gamers have different skill levels in abstract games, a parent versus child for example. If the God powers are carefully selected you can have an incredibly fun, even match of wits. Conceptually I love this game and the 3D interlocking pieces are among the highest quality of any game at this price point. It's not perfect, but there is a lot to love about this version of Santorini especially when paired with the very fun mechanic and extra powers and heroes that the Golden Fleece expansion adds. Pick up a copy for your collection, you'll find it makes it to the table top quite often.

[BGCOLOR=#FFFF00][COLOR=#000000]Family.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Abstract. Ignored it on KS but lots of good things about it afterward, so picked it up in trade. Need to try with the family.

Update: played 3p with wife and 9yo daughter. At first my wife was skeptical... two turns in she asked if this was a children's game. A few turns after that and she had her game-face on, and ended up winning, declaring the game a hit. :)

Super simple rules but what I'd almost call emergent gameplay -- at least for us. Every couple turns some ramification of the flow of play dawns on you and you realize that you have to watch out for being trapped, watch out for being domed and blocked, etc.

Great game deserving of its buzz.

Sima absztrakt játék gyönyörű kivitelben. A Torrest juttatta eszembe, hisz ebben is két-két emberünkkel tornyokba mászunk fel és célunk a harmadik szintre fellépés valamelyik bábúnkkal vagy ellenfelünk mindkét bábújának bezárása. Egyet lépünk és a mellettünk levő 9 területre egy szintet építenünk kell. Egyet tudunk fellépni, a harmadik szint után pedig egy tetőt tehetünk az épületre, ezzel megakadályozva a fellépést. Ennyi az egész, amit még megbolondíthatnak különböző képességekkel rendelkező hősök, a páros játékban pedig felváltva lépünk. A játék egy hiba elég és nyer a másik fél. Nincs kis és nagy hiba, mert elég könnyen észrevehető a másik elnézése. Abszolút nem vagyok az ilyen játékok kedvelője, a pontszámom ennek tükrében érdemes nézni.

Perfectly fine abstract is made far better by the special god powers. Each game then becomes it's own puzzle, trying to figure out how the powers play out against each other. Very addictive. It's a big plus that the game plays so fast. The game itself is quite pretty (although I'd be very happy to play without the silly island cliff board mount).

The downside of the game is the art. The most awful is the game box itself. Insipid grinning cartoon characters scream "I'm a stupid game, don't buy me!" Blech. The god cards have similar cartoon art but it's not anywhere near as awful as the box. Why did it have to be a bunch of god children depicted? Such a weird choice. Of course, the game is selling like crazy so they probably knew what they were doing.

One of my favorite abstract games gets a real release with great quality, albeit slightly childish, components.

I'm not normally fan of abstract strategy games but "Santorini" is one I'll play.

You control 2 pawns. Each turn you move a pawn to an adjacent square, pawns can only move up one level higher than their current height, then drop a building adjacent to your pawn. Be the first to get to the the third height level and you win.

Simple to play but very tactical.

It is prone to a little bit of stalling as skilled players can nearly endlessly chase each other around ruining each others plans.

This is an abstract strategy game built for 2 players.  There are also 3-player and 4-player team rules and a variant with God powers but I haven't played those variants.  In this game players take turns making a move with one of their 2 playing pieces and then building a structure in a surrounding space.  Players can move up one level or down any number of levels and structures can be 3 levels high and capped with a roof.  A roof prevents someone from moving onto a 3-level structure and the winner is the first player to move onto a 3-level structure.

It's pretty good for a two-player abstract game and the way the board is put together where it looks like a plot of land on a high cliff is really attractive.  There's just not a lot to this once you scrub away all the flashiness of the board and the pieces.  And 2-player abstract games can get a bit boring.

I don't get the huge appeal.  I like games with simple set of choices that produce an interesting array of options.  This one definitely had the former but I'm not convinced of the later.

Beautiful, abstract 2 player game (it can be played with more players, but for the most part it IS a 2 player game) that only takes 10 - 15 minutes to play. Can be played multiple times in a row or just as a filler. Easy to teach and learn, yet satisfyingly brain burning.

So simple and easy to learn. The God cards make the game so dynamic. Almost feels like a MOBA in the way that you are controlling a character with a special ability and you need to play and strategize based on the abilities. A bit short and samey after a while.

This rating is based on my first three plays of the game.  Part of the problem is that this game has been pretty hyped up, and personally, I am not getting on the hype wagon.  The game is okay.... I guess.  the different powers offered by the different gods makes for different game experiences, but overall I think it's just okay.

This is the kind of game that I can recommend for any audience.  I have played against many people, and have an extra copy I intend to gift to my father so he can play with all the grandchildren.  Simple mechanics, epic god powers, and beautiful artwork make this a game that belongs on everybody's shelf.  It feels like a cross between chess and 3D tic-tac-toe, where you always have to consider where your builders are and the positions of the other player, and where each move, you need to be taking the advantage, because if you're always blocking, you aren't moving towards victory.

I don't know how I feel about this game completely yet. It's got amazingly great design and the pasted on theme actually works well enough, especially with the Gods.

It probably doesn't help that I'm not a huge 2 player gamer, outside of Magic and similar games. This game is better than other 2 player games I've played and it helps that you can play it with more.

There is a lot of strategy and variety with this game. It also plays very quickly with very little time thinking.

RATING: 7
I'm not a big abstract fan or 2 player non-coop fan, but Santorini managed to find a crack in the armor.  As with all abstracts, the rules are simple: Move one of your two guys and build 1 level of a structure.  The goal is to move one of your guys onto a level 3 structure.  Super simple rules.

Two things make Santorini stand above the rest.  First, the components are great.  Who doesn't like a 3 dimensional board with 3 dimensional gamely?  Plus, the art is great.  Secondly, and most importantly, the variable player powers (one of my favorite mechanisms).  Each game, you get a special power, of which there are maybe 60.  They are generally pretty simple rules (move an extra space, build an extra structure, push your opponent, etc.), but they completely change the game.  It makes each game feel brand new and you are constantly having to evaluate new strategies and react to your opponent's powers.  This is what keeps the game fresh whereas I am normally bored with abstracts after 2 plays.

It's still a 2 player competitive game, so I don't expect to play it much.  I hear there is a 4 player team game, and would love to give that a try some day.

It's quite engaging and has high replayability.

God powers don't have a large enough impact on each game to keep things interesting every time. Rules are simple enough to play with kids, and games don't run too long.

I am really missing what all the hubbub could possible be about this game.  Yes, it's attractive looking.  Our one play was admittedly with 4 players (which the game is not really designed for), and we may have had a crappy selection of god powers (randomly including Zeus, which turns out to be quite broken), but the game was really just an exercise in (briefly) forestalling the inevitable.  We all just said "what the heck was that?" when it was over after a few minutes.  The other group of people at the next table over said the exact same thing when they finished.  I would definitely be willing to try again; it's not *horrible*, but really this has to be the most over-rated game I think I've ever seen, and for once I am not saying "over-rated" when I only mean "I don't like it."

Excellent production of an excellent game! Highly recommendable. Combines the elegance and the replayability of an abstract with the design quality of a high end euro and the genuine theme of an excellent ameritrash. I.e. the best of all worlds!

The god and hero cards make sure that games differ a lot from setup to setup. However, even the base game without powers is great. And the game looks great too. A great game for adults as well as kids. Best with two players!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.1
Fantastic game! Basegame (without the god powers) is excellent. Even better with the god powers. Also suited for young kids, who without problems can pick up the special powers explained by icons at each card. Kids love the game - likely because of the heavy theme.

Print and Play edition:
I printed front and back of the good and hero cards on cardboard, glued front and back together and finally laminated the individual cards. I am using the small board with tiles from my old Scrabble set as blocks and meeples as workers. For domes I have bisected and painted 18mm cotton balls.

Looking forward to the manufactured version of the game with its nice blocks gets out.

Among evenly matched opponents, I'm not entirely convinced that the powers are all that balanced or that there isn't a start player advantage.

Despite that, the game is good. A single match takes about 15 minutes at most, and the god powers really change how you play. Really fun, and of course the production is very well done.

Santorini is a beautiful little abstract. Setup and playtime are a breeze, teardown takes a little more time.

[thing=194655][/thing] showed itself as a game with light rules and agile flow, with its major "complications" coming from the special powers of the many, many gods and heroes (the KS edition comes with a lot of them). The mandatory actions are: move than build adjacent to the worker that moved. The goal in to move a worker to the third floor of a building. The hard part is that the opponents keep blocking your way, usually by build a roof at the top of the third floor before you have the chance to move a worker there.

It is simple, elegant and efficient; with the multitude of special powers of the gods and the interactions between them, giving a high replay value, demanding that the players constantly approach the game in different ways, in order to circle around the powers of others and take the most benefit from you own.

The production value is top notch, and building the island has a is very pretty end result.

[thing=194655][/thing] is likely better for 2p, being faster, without so much blocking, as in 3 or 4 players the board gets crowded fast and the constant blocking can became boring.

Overall, [thing=194655][/thing] is a good game, filled with options, easy to play and teach. It is pretty on the table, has nice pacing and it duration is quite reasonable. Even if 2 players abstract (wich [thing=194655][/thing] mostly is) games aren't my preference, I enjoyed what I played and liked what I saw.

On paper, the game sounds simple with lots of variability coming from playing different gods. But game play still felt bland and somewhat repetitive over a series of plays. True, the players get to move differently and the win conditions are different, but the mechanics of the game remain unchanged. You have to shadow each other all the time to be competitive. If a builder is allowed to do their own thing, then winning becomes much easier. This shadowing can be a crutch at times because you can end up playing defensively most of the game. We also felt that some of the god combinations are imbalanced. Again, the game is fast enough that you can play another different combination, but I don't think the combos are all fully tested. The fact that some combos in the expansion are banned tells me that powers were not fully fleshed out during the Kickstarter campaign before offering them as stretch goals. That said, the production values are top notch and the components are really well-crafted. The figures are a little smaller than expected but the designers claim it is easier to manipulate and move around during game play.

While there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the game, we just didn't find it engaging or all that fun.

The basics of the games is a great abstract strategy exercise.  What makes the game great is the "God powers". Just with the base game there is 30 or more god powers that change the game play. For each new game brings a new power which makes me adjust my winning strategy.  I have played the game ten times already and every time it has be a puzzle against my opposite along with figuring how to use my power effectively.

Shay backed this on Kickstarter 2016.
I want to give this game a higher rating, because it is a SOLID game; but I just don't prefer it and am almost never in the mood for it. So...it doesn't get much enthusiasm from me, despite it being a good game.

This game is amazing! The mechanics are really simple and it's really easy to learn and the addition of the god cards keeps every game exciting! A perfect two player game. The game has additional rules to support a 3-4 players game, however, I personally have not tried that. As a two player game, it is PERFECT!

I bought this game to play with my kids.  I wanted a game that my kids could learn to love boardgames as much as I do.  It worked!  It really is very easy to teach.  I taught my 7 year old daughter, and 15 minutes later, she was teaching my wife.  My kids have absolutely fallen in love with the game and ask to play all the time.  We haven't even gotten to the God cards yet!  The basic game without the cards is fun all on it's own.

Love the art, love the pieces, really interesting strategy game.  Not something you make a whole night of, but a really fun 'get me over' kinda game while youre waiting for the other person to show or before you pull out the big stuff.  ...Of course you can just go nuts on it and play the whole deck in a sitting if you want... Not that I've done that...

While Santorini doesn't have a plethora of mechanics, it more than makes up for that through gameplay depth. Even without the god cards, I feel like every game we've played has been different. I relish the situations that arise where both players know that one mistake will cost them the game, and then once that mistake is inevitably made, there are many joyful exhortations.

Likely to rise to 9 or 10 with repeated plays.

Very good abstract game with practically infinite replayability. Very simple basic gameplay which is good in itself, but what makes it great is the large number of God special ability powers which change the game slightly or significantly. It will probably take a lifetime to get good at playing and playing against all the different Gods. Add to that, several very different game modes: 2-player, 3-player, 2v2-player, Golden Fleece as well as one-off Hero special ability powers and more.

Only negative about this game for our family is theme.  It works for the game but it heavy in Greek mythology.  They use "big G" when talking about Greek gods.  It was almost a deal breaker.  Just be aware if you care about that sort of thing.

Gameplay is great.  We have owned it for about a week and its been played roughly 30 times.  Kids (8 & 9) play it for hours on their own.  Quick, easy to earn, lots of variety with the different powers.

RATING: 10
My favorite abstract. I built a wooden & tile play set years ago but this new version is such a stunner. Play with the god powers and the game has instant appeal even to non-gamers.

: My favorite way to play :

I like dealing out 12 god cards to each player and then doing a draft.

After the draft is complete each player receives their opponent's deck and chooses a god power to eliminate.

Player's then get their drafted powers back (minus the eliminated power) and reduce their hand of 11 to a hand of 8.

Play a "best of seven".

Best way to play the game, IMO.

[UPDATE]After playing several games in 4 players I must say Santorini is still spectacular with 4 players. Even for us novices, the Gods that seem overpowered like Pan get "normalized" as each power is used once in two turns of the same team. And using 4 powers together is just crazy and fun!

I can't suggest this game enough!

Probably the best most intriguing and fun abstract game ever.
I played just a few games but I am already quite convinced this is a true masterpiece in its simplicity, variety and strange depth.
I NEED to have this game SOON!!

I am no fan of abstracts, but Santorini really works for me due to the god cards. If those weren't there, this would probably be rated a 7 or so: fine, but it wouldn't stay in my collection for long. With the god cards, it really elevates this game to something truly special. And boy is it gorgeous.

Weird edition: the plastic pieces look good on the board,
but look and feel cheap otherwise. Wish I had a wood set, honestly!
The board also looks cheap: why do you suppose they added the plastic 'mountain', but went with such chintzy cardboard for the playing surface?)

Gameplay: It's a bit too much 'tic-tac-toe'-like for two people for my taste,
the special powers are somewhat imbalanced as well, IMO.
After four games I was ready to sell this one, honestly,
but it redeemed itself by being a fairly decent -three- player game.

I am super super excited to play this for some reason, probably because it's greek mythology related.

It was really fun to play and simple to teach for the first time. We played without God cards because I was playing with non-boardgamers though, so I'm sure my score for it will increase the more I play it. :)

Thanks Santa :D

What I like:
-Average game is 15-20 minutes.
-Great balance of strategic depth without being too overbearing.
-The asymmetric powers greatly increase replay ability.
-The game is visually stunning.
-Takes only 2 minutes to explain the game to a new player.

What I don't like:
-On the expensive side for a quick, abstract game.

TL;DR
If you like abstract or strategic games, you will not be disappointed.

Santorini is a rare gem that comes along once every several years. It's a game that on the cover looks to be childish and simple; however, Santorini possess a depth of strategy and component quality that stands above it's peers. Though it is a glorified abstract game, it is one that can be played an infinite number of times, throwing in different god cards to spice game play up, or even played straight as strategy game. 

It's the only game I regret not having backed when I had the chance. It's a game that will never leave my collection and that I look forward to playing with my kids when they come of age.

Only a few plays, but see the potential for high replay-ability.

Update dropped from 8 to 7.5 because new players seem to zone out on the key aspects completely. For the very low complexity of the rules, this is highly undesirable. I may try doing a video introduction next time. I just know that other simple abstracts did not have the same issues with the people mentioned.

Dropping to 7 because the game has not hit the table in 3+ months.

Beautiful to look at and eloquent to play, Santorini has set a new bar for abstracts. This is, in fact, my FAVORITE abstract. The theme is there, I suppose. I love the sheer amount of gods to choose from, albeit my only gripe, is that some gods seem too powerful and a few seem too weak. The basic game is so simple but blends in just the right amount of strategy and tactics. It doesn't hurt that the game is 3D and stunning to look at.

A pleasant little move and place abstract with wonderfully overproduced components.  Simple rules lead to a deep enough quick game as you try to be the first to climb one of your figures to the top of a stack of 3 blocks while blocking your opponent from doing so.  If that gets stale there are a bunch of special ability cards that change up the game.  Those very cool components make this very appealing for the kids so we may have finally found an abstract for the whole family!

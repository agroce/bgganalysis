It's an odd, attractive, tactile treat; great for families and couples, or as a filler between meatier titles for gamers. It helps that it scales so well for 2-5 players and plays quickly. The game has just enough personality to attract players who wouldn't normally go for an abstract game.

I really liked this at first but the more I play, the more I realise the starting mess of creating the mountain doesn’t make the game balanced enough so some people get off to great starts while others can never really flourish because we've put too many of their tiles the wrong way round.

Rating is for 2-player game, and I'm pretty sure this is the worst player count as it's a zero-sum game, and not all that interesting.

Neat game, I could see it being awesome at 3 players and still fun at 4 despite being really busy/frenetic.

It doesn't exactly have a ton of depth, but I really like the Climbers! All you do is manipulate a block or move your pawn every turn in an attempt to declare yourself king of the hill, assuming no one else can get higher than you. 

I love the spatiality and tactile experience of playing this game.

Move a block, move your pawn higher up the block tower, climb higher than your opponents at the game's end.  Some lovely components, including good hefty blocks and wooden ladders.  The game works fine, but after only a few plays there's a certain sameness to it.

RATING: 7
On first play, this move blocks, climb up on the blocks game felt like an amusing three dimensional puzzle, somewhat along the lines of Jenga in its feel of play.  As a family game, I think it should work quite well.   As for serious gamers, I do wonder a bit about replayablity and the possible degeneration of the game into destructive placements that might have king making problems.

RATING: 6.6
I'm not the biggest fan of abstract games. For those who are, the Climbers is one of the most  beautifully simple and clever abstracts to come out in while. It looks impressive on the table, incredibly tactile, rules are simple enough for young children to grasp. However, the simplicity may work against the game's longevity when the novelty wears off. Reminded me a bit of Santorini, a game which doesn't have quite the visual or tactile impact but a great deal more variety & complexity. Despite these reservations, I think the Climbers is destined to become an cult classic.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This is a nice 3D abstract.  In the first plays, it is hard to see how to setup moves in the future turns to be able to move, place block, move.  In many ways it feels like the players should have the option to place the block and then do 2 moves, but the rules are quite clear that it's move-place-move.  The arrangement of the initial structure makes a difference on the block growth, as does the number of players.  The ladders are an interesting touch and it's not obvious that they should be saved for later or used to get a jump on the other players.  Overall, the game offers opportunity to explore, but it's unlikely that players will find themselves compelled to play several games in a row - despite the really fast play times.  It's a good filler and visually appealing, but not one that will likely get "lots of study".

A silly but fun game, although the first half of the game isn't quite as fun as it should be. It's only once you get into place trying to block one another that the fun is unlocked.

The heaviest of the Chili games, so far.  The thing is pretty much a brick, a shoebox filled to the brim with wood.  This sucker is HEAVY!!!

This is also probably the best of the Chili games, so far.  It takes all the good bits of stacking games and chucks out the bad bits.  The whole king of the hill aspect felt a little silly until I actually started playing and seeing how things were turning out.  The organic flow of the tower really made this game exciting throughout play.  

If I could only own one chili game, this is the one I would get.

A fun spatial game where players try to climb a tower of blocks and be the highest or first to reach the top. Some interesting 3D thinking and quick gameplay make this one quite fun. There are blocking discs which can be placed to really hinder your opponent’s plans so it makes sense to try to move up with some amount of flexibility where possible. A fun game and a unique experience unlike most other games.

A '3' seems over harsh - but I really don't like this type of game, to the point I'd rather go do something else than play it.

If it's played fast then it's bearable as a filler - but with full information it can descend into AP hell, or because you're so vulnerable to what others do a negotiated bash the leader so the game drags on for ever.

So, probably a gem with the right players - I'm not one of those players!

This is one of my favorite abstract games. It's perfect for about any situation. Everyone can enjoy this game in my opinion. 

If there is any negative things to say it would be the quality of the game parts itself. Some of the blocks are not cut equal and the paint job could have been better. Some of the blocks bled through.The shoe box that the game comes in is pathetic, and the instructions could have been more clear with more demonstrations.

However this game makes up for its freshness leaving you wanting to play again and again which is why i rank this game an even 8

Cool, chunky bits and a good game to boot!  Die Aufsteiger is a very spatial game as you try to envision what blocks you will want to place where in order to allow your dude to climb to the top.

The game is pretty free-flowing and open-ended; a little less structured than what you'd expect but still works just fine.  I really enjoyed the ladders which allow for some surprise moves.  Players that appear isolated can creatively use the ladders to get somewhere that it would otherwise be pretty tough to get to.  Overall, a great little game that will work well with the game group but also be a hit with family and friends.

I think the gimmick could get old a bit quickly though; thus it's only a once every blue moon play for me.

Updated 7/12/10.

I originally thought this would be something like Blokus: an interesting spatial puzzle that comes out occasionally to cleanse the palate between more complicated games.  Instead, this has become a favorite at game night, and has provided tremendous replay value, with all the depth of strategy and difficult decisions of most good board games.  While the colorful wooden blocks, cute climbers, and their adorable ladders can either make the game inviting or off-putting (depending on how seriously you take your gaming), the gameplay itself is always quite nerve-wracking and tense, satisfying even the most gamer-y gamer.  Surprisingly good.

Beautiful pieces and interesting game. It seems to pay to work co-operatively (if you can convince anyone to trust you) until your last move. It's all about timing your double-cross so your competitors can't catch back up and keeping hold of your ladders and blocking piece for as long as possible. The purple and red surfaces can be difficult to distiguish in poor light. I wouldn't enjoy playing this if there was more than a hint of negotiated bash-the-leader style play.

I wasn't sure what to think of this game when I bought it, but it's a very intriguing abstract strategy game where you are trying to be king of the hill. On your turn you move and then hopefully move and rotate another block in the tower in a way so you can use it to move up again. Throughout the game you have 3 one time use abilities (a small ladder, a large ladder, and a blocking piece). The ladders help you move up in higher gaps and the blocker piece ensures a piece can't be moved until your turn comes around again. This is definitely a game where you stand up and walk around the table to play, and has you thinking more and more the longer the game goes on. The first few rounds went quick, but as we got towards the top we really were thinking about how to keep moving up. A very different game that has great table presence and I'm really happy I decided to buy this one.

What an extraordinarily different game! For that alone I love it. Three dimensional but not dexterity. Strategic without feeling heavy. Surprising in its depth but consistently fun.

I am just starting to learn how to position myself to get up the tower quickly and efficiently.  I have also learned that my spatial thinking needs a little refining so that I don't misjudge the size of that step and have to burn my ladders.

In the end the gameplay just never felt tight enough or strategic enough.  At the player counts with which I played, it was too easy to do what you wanted.  Traded.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An impressive thing to look at...and gives some interesting decisions.

Our group felt that there is some imbalance in the colors, due to the gray "wild" colors.  If you're the color opposite gray on the blocks, you have a greater chance to not have the orientations you need available to you.

But if played more quickly as a lighter game, rather than as an AP-inducing heavy game, it works brilliantly. I'd play this again, but I think the novelty will probably wear off after a little while.

Pretty decent game. Pink is seriously disadvantaged by having only one orientation with which any piece can be used by them. The game can as we found draw out when table talk and ganging up on the leader to prevent the win occurs. Played with 4 players (no pink) and no table talk it would probably be better and rate higher.

This is a great looking and good playing abstract. Victory does seem to ride more on getting lucky from an opponents mistake than good play though. This seems to be a function of the accelerating decay of options towards the end. It can quite quickly reach a point where, only with careful play, can someone still climb higher and if someone stuffs up, the lucky mug at the top wins. And yet get to the top too early and you'll run out of options too.
So timing is key it seems rather than positioning.
Great game though. ;-)

An abstract puzzle game with blocks that have different colors on their faces.   Your climber can only stand on his own color (or the generic "wild" white color).   On your turn, you move or rotate a free block, and then move your climber.   The highest climber wins at the end of the game.   Kind of a neat idea, but it's not the kind of game that I usually prefer, although I'm glad to have tried it.

This is a game I bought specifically to play with my children and as such, I would normally hold off on rating it until I played it with a child.  However, I keep thinking about it and I fear it's going to be just as much of a dud with them.  

You are basically playing a game of who can get to the top of a giant tower.  The tower is constructed by the players at the start of the game and is constantly being adjusted.  Reading the description online and looking at the pictures, I thought this game was going to be incredibly fun.

Unfortunately, I've played it with 3 different people and each time, it's ended the same: alternate stacking half cubes and whole cubes until your opponent is unable to advance, then win.  boooooorrrrrriiiiiinnnnnngggg.

My husband told me I should have known something was up when we opened the box from amazon.com and realized the game came in an orange shoebox.

Loads of fun playing this building game. The rules are simple, but we had to keep in mind the ending condition, triggered but NOT CLIMBING, not by NOT MOVING. It says 45 minutes on the box. We took 2 hours. We are 4 hardened gamers, and had great fun climbing higher and higher. We finished with a 3 tower monster at least a metre tall. We kept thinking it was over, but we found ways to push the game further and further. Great experience, a must buy game for stacking fans.

This is a huge brain burner, like chess.  It takes every bit of 45 minutes and more.  With 5 players there is too much down time (with thinkers)and perhaps a 3-minute timer should be employed.  Some people just bog down with too many options.  (Will rate it higher than 6.8 if play starts moving faster.)

Our house rule is, once a block is touched, move it or leave it (and forfeit your move).  Once placed and fingers removed, movement is over.  This rule can greatly decrease the playing time and make the game less boring and keeps the stack together much better.

Sometimes the person you think is behind, can win, especially if they are the only one left with ladders.

Great components.  A quality game.  

I added some chips--one of each color pawn that players keep in front of them, and then most helpful, a small white chip that we put on a block when moved and which is immediately removed at the end of the next person's turn.  I also have a large white "Moved up Last" chip when playing with 5 players, but we only use it as the end is anticipated.

I always appreciate a game like this, where the game board/layout changes every game.  Adds to the game's replay ability.

I've played 2 & 3-player games now.  It is certainly much faster and so I increased the rating.

RATING: 7
It's a little bit of a novelty with the cool pieces, but there's a nice tension there as to just when to make your move.  There's definitely some luck, but it's very accessible and fun to try and cooperate with other players.  The gameplay just isn't intriguing me as much as I thought it might.  The downtime can also be just a little bit much for how much strategic possibility the game offers.

This game has a lot of play in it, especially if you follow the advice about being "creative" with your play.

The loose play, allowing moves by any player inbetween block movements, means there is no real downtime (apart from the current player trying to figure out which block to move, of course).

It's involving, it's pretty, it's not so easy to win.  What more could you want from a multiplayer abstract?

The Climbers is a 3-dimensional race in which the goal is not necessarily to be the fastest climber but to construct the most sustainable path up.

The game is part geometrical puzzle, part gratuitous blocking and jostling for the best positions. It always seems you have too few ladders while your opponents have too many...

Bought this for my folks.  A good family game to play with kids.  Plays short but not a lot of strategy going on here and the rule book was a little vague in some spots.  Still a fun game with some different things going on there so would recommend, but mostly to play with kids.

The Climbers is a stunningly beautiful abstracts that falls into the "build something lovely" sub-category. Our games typically last right around 30mins, but every once in a while someone finds a way to go higher, thus extending the tension. This is one of the best 3p combinatorial-like abstracts that I've ever played.

This is a really fun game. The loop holes in the rules can actually be a positive thing. It allows the players to choose how to play before the game. Allowing for varying natures of gameplay which increases the replay value of the game. The game plays fairly quick, so long as players don't suffer from Ap, which wasn't a problem in the game that I played.

The components are really well made and have a good weight to them. Although the copy that I played had a problem with what looked like paint runs or smears on some sides of the blocks. I don't know if this is a common thing or just a problem with the copy I got to play. It did detract from the appearance of the game somewhat.

Overall the game was a lot of fun and I'd recommend it to most people if they don't mind clarifying by what rules they would like to use at the begining of the game. I've held off on this game due to the rules for quite sometime, but now that I got it played. I will be looking to add it to my collection in the near future.

*UPDATE*
The english rules rewrite fix a lot of the debatable rules in the game and yet still offer them as varients with clearer rules. Allowing for clearer and more ways to plays the game. I am very happy with the rules rewrite and will be placing my order.

Wasn't sure about the game from the description, but it plays surprisiingly well, with plenty of decisions and fun interaction.  I thought only having a single use of the ladders would be limiting, but instead it means you value them highly - too highly for me as I never used them the entire first game!  Looking forward to more plays, both with gamers and the children.

Bought direct from publisher in February 2014.

This looks stunning on the table, and easily draws an audience in. But my first few plays of it felt a little lacklustre.

However, recently, I'm starting to like it more. Maybe I "get it" now. Let's hope the trend continues.

--

After at least a dozen plays I decided this game was fatally flawed (and it has since been utterly replaced by [thing=38429][/thing]).

Two problems with The Climbers: the first bunch of turns often feel rote - the real key decisions come when the tower is tall and the options are quickly reducing. The second problem is (with more than two players) I've often had games where one player is ahead and the others have to conspire to keep him from winning, and this pattern repeats, artificially extending the game until someone happens to be beyond catching. No doubt skillful players could control both of these issues and make every move count, but the game attracts lighter gamers who don't necessarily want to think that deeply (and the "best move" is certainly opaque unless it's a forced prevent-the-win move).

From an email discussion: "Climbers is nice, perhaps really good. I don't know yet. It's very possible I like it more than I should because of the novelty and pleasing tactility of the blocks. I need to play more to find out. The blocks are really nice as physical things, I can certainly attest to that."

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I was thrilled to finally play Climbers and it was... fine. The game play is simple, despite the obtuse rule book, but in the end I didn't feel I had many interesting decisions to make. Grab a block that fits, slot it in place, move up, repeat. The rule book indicates there are opportunities to take out-of-turn moves but I think this happened once in our two games. That's a small sample size but I doubt you get these opportunities very often. Strategy-wise, the game does ramp up at the end but it's too little too late in my opinion. 

Glad I played it and will happily play it again but Climbers is off my wishlist.

The Climbers is a great looking abstract game that fails to click. The goal is to climb to the top of the tower, and you are only allowed to stand on neutral or same color spots. I played this at two players, and it felt meaningless. Always place the blocking cube in front of the opponent. Then always climb up a level or two. It doesn't seem like there is much here. I would like to try it again with a larger amount of players, but as of now, Climbers is not near as good as its presentation.

Players first build a mountain out of wooden blocks, then the wooden climbers (who look a bit like playschool people) are placed onto blocks that match their color. Each turn you can move a block and then move your character up to an adjacent block one level higher. You have three one-use items: two ladders and a blocking disk. After setup there are no random elements.

This is a cute little multiplayer abstract with very nice wooden components. It has simple rules and looks good on the table which make it very accessible. 

Players will use ladders and blocks to try to get their pawns to the highest level on the tower. Pawns can only go on their own color or on the neutral gray color. 

With the full complement of players, a lot can change between one turn and the next, so your plans can easily be foiled. It's also a bit tricky to figure out HOW exactly you can accomplish your next move, even if you know what you want to do. The 3D element doesn't do you any favors either, as you will need to walk around the table to make sure you can see all your options.

All in all, I'd play it from time to time, but it doesn't really get me excited.

This almost abstract game looks like a child's building blocks, giving a homey appearance, but it's actually a very interesting spacial puzzle/race game.

It plays fairly quickly- not too much AP here. The pieces are nice to handle, and it's very satisfying either scurrying by the others, or stymieing them with a well-timed move or block.

Great for the spacially minded, but easy enough for kids to join in as well.

A very nice little game.

Played this at Geekway to the West 2010. Interesting spatial/dexterity game with a push-your-luck quality. Players deconstruct/decompose a random assortment of wooden blocks, each of various size and color pattern. Moving one block at a time, they rearrange the block in such a way to steadily move their figure up, moving along paths only those of its color. There may be blocking or trapping involved. It is an aesthetically pleasing game to play, and a sight to see from afar at a con. I'm not sure I'd play this one again, but glad I did. Everyone should try this at least once just to feel like a kid again. It's a solid '5'.

There is a good game here somewhere, but not in its current state. The rule that you must move first means little if your random starting color is poorly positioned. I found that using your ladders as quickly as possible to get to the top then screwing over your opponents by moving blocks so that they don't move seems the best way to win. Once you can't move (by not having your color or neutral color close by)  I don't see anyone helping you to get back into the game.

The Climbers is an abstract game that not only looks great, but plays great.  It's a heck of a thing to have so many moves at the beginning and watch as those moves slowly slip away as the structure grows in height.  The only thing that's a little unfortunate is that not all the pieces are perfect in that sometimes when the stacks grow, they tend to lean a bit.  This doesn't necessarily break the game, but can result in a possible crashing of blocks and unintentionally end the game.  Otherwise, a really great game with really nifty components.  I love those ladders.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Players throw together a pile of blocks, draw a color and go! On your turn you can move a block, move your climber, and/or place your single-use blocking stone - or do none of it. All moves are optional. Blocks come in three sizes (half, full and double) and each side either has a player color or a neutral grey that any player can use. When moving a block, players can move any free block to any available space and put any color they choose facing up. Climbers can climb half-block levels onto their own color or the neutral platforms and players have two single-use ladders that are a single and double block in length. Blocking stone are single-use and are removed at the beginning of the player's next turn. The object is to be the highest player on the tower after a full round when no player has advanced upward.

This is a satisfying, chunky wooden game with cool tactical options on each turn. The visual appeal is immense. My only issue is that if a player cannot advance themselves late in the game, it is very easy for them to place a block to hinder one player while helping another. This however is a minor quibble, but could irritate really competitive players.

This is a fun game in which you climb up blocks of the same color with half steps being free and larger steps requiring a ladder. You only have two ladders that cover either one or two steps. The ladders can only be used once. First on your turn you move and rotate a block to help your climb. A grey side can be used by anyone and you have a single token to protect a block for your next turn. Whoever is highest after a round in which no more blocks can be placed wins.

Rules are unclear on the movement. The author seemed to favour a less restrictive approach than the publisher. We played that you are only allowed to move if you end your turn on a higher level. According to discussions on the new edition there should be no such restrictions.

Definitely a unique game that is visually appealing.  You really need a lazy susan or something similar to ease the playing experience for everyone.

I think that my rating would be higher if I understood how to play a little better, so maybe it will go up in time.  I like the concept of the game, but it is difficult for me to grasp how to play well - it seems like the type of game where everyone needs to be at the right skill level to enjoy.  It also seems like table talk might be a little damaging.  Since we tend to talk a lot, it is hard to avoid, but it feels a little unfair, since people are going to want to gang up on the leader, and having everyone take their turn to hurt the person that's winning isn't that gratifying.

Not my thing, but not a bad game. I've seen it take too long, but when played only semi-seriously, it's thinky, tricky and entertaining. There are lots of interesting ways to block the other players, so to speak, and I might enjoy this more once I'd worked all the patterns out. Five players looks to be too many, though, and don't play this with AP sufferers or the spreadsheetier among your Euro-pals.

One serious drawback: it matches the color scheme from the Overlook Hotel in Kubrick's The Shining almost precisely.

An abstract game with tons of wood in the box!  Each player plays wooden blocks of different lengths, with different colors on each side.  One color is safe for all players to put their pieces on, otherwise you are restricted to only land on pieces with your color facing up.  The aim is to be "king of the hill" and get to a higher height than all other players.  There are also single-use ladders you can use to jump up higher than normally possible, or to cross gaps.

Blocks are randomly set out in an initial start and you are trying to race other climbers to the top.  You have a short and long ladder and a blocking stone you can use once per game.  You take blocks and move them to different locations so that you can move your climber up.  The block tower grows taller over time.  Eventually, you get to point where you cannot move higher and there are not more blocks that can be place that allow you to move.  

It is a clever abstract game.  I have only played once but really liked it. Very solid family weight game.

Hope it's good. Impulse buy Jan 22, 2010.

Arrived Jan 25, 2010

My son and I played it right away and we both liked it.  It's pretty much what you'd expect. A sort of Rumis-y kind of puzzle feel to it.

I must say that the translations are somewhat of a mess. Apparently there are differences of opinion on what a move entails that didn't translate well.

The designer wished a more free-form movement where people could move their climber even when it wasn't their turn.  The English rules explicitly prohibit that.

I think I may try a variant where a player takes an "English" turn and then it goes once around the table allowing players to move their climber (no ladders, block movement, or blocking stones allowed). Then the next player takes his "English" turn.

An English turn consists of (in order) 1) optionally move a block, 2) optionally move a climber (ladders allowed), 3) optionally place a blocking stone.   If you don't end up higher at the end of your "English" turn, then your turn counts as a "pass" that could trigger the end of the game.

A quick abstract game that has players building (and traveling) higher and higher trying to isolate their opponents so that they cannot travel as high.  If your climber is the highest and your opponents cannot travel any higher on their turns then you win.  Each player starts with 2 ladders and a blocker that are very valuable and can each only be used once during the span of the game.  Beautiful production.

RATING: 7
Well-produced game with a big emphasis on spatial thinking!  Move the beautiful wooden blocks around to help your climber get to the highest point in a tower.  Light and easily teachable to non-gamers -- a plus for nice components.  Lots of tactical play adds sporadic fun even for heavy gamers.

I see the appeal of this game. It's very eye-catching and sturdy. The ladders are especially attractive, though disappointingly not really used physically. I can't say I really enjoy the gameplay though. It's probably just my lack of skill, but I constantly find myself in situations where my options to help myself are few and to set up others many. Add that this is hard to find, I just don't get the appeal.

Will reevaluate my rating once I can play it with 3-5 players.

2-5 players 

Up to this point, have played only a few games. 2-player games have been alright, but the level of fun really goes up with more players. Not expecting there was much game in mere "building blocks", my friends have been pleasantly surprised.

From description:
"It is an easy-to-learn, all-wooden, 3D strategy game with beautiful components, which include 35 colorful blocks of different sizes, a climber pawn for each player, a blocking stone for each player, and a short and a long ladder for each player. Starting with all the blocks in a random tower, players move a block and then climb up the tower gradually -- without ladders for small steps up, and with ladders for larger climbs. Blocking stones keep the block in place and unoccupied for one round, but you can only use your blocking stones and each ladder once during the game. The winner is whoever gets to the highest point first when no one can go higher for one round. You can only climb onto surfaces that are the same color as your climber or gray (a neutral color any climbers can use). Alternate rules allow for simultaneous movement and using ladders as bridges."

[u]Rule clarifications[/u]

1. [thread=488164]Order of Turn actions [/thread]
[size=8]Note: before your turn even begins, you can move your pawn if you like (and if it is possible), because this is actually part of the general movement rule: everyone can move between turns, provided they do not use ladders, and if there are any conflicts, they are resolved in turn order starting with the person whose turn it is.[/size]

 "A turn basically consists of moving a block and usually the attempt to move your pawn higher directly before and/or after that. During your turn, you may move one block or “pass” and move no block."

a.  Move, or rotate, or move [i]and[/i] rotate a block. You also may choose not to.
b.  Move pawn. Or choose to pass.
[size=8]Note: It's important to note that your climber must finish the turn higher than when your turn started. If not, it's considered a "pass".  The game ends when all players have passed and the first player to pass has passed for a second time. For example, you can move your climber down, move a block and then move the climber back up, but he has to be higher than where he started the turn, otherwise it is a pass.[/size]
c. You can place your blocking stone (which is removed from the game after a round of play, that is, at the beginning of your next turn).

2. [thread=547647] [/thread]
You can move any combination of up, down, and horizontally, but only half-cube heights ("1"), or using ladders and only on surfaces that are gray or your color. If you end up lower (or no higher) than when you began your turn, you are considered to have passed.  Note: The game ends when all players have passed and the first player to pass has passed for a second time.

3. [thread=479054]Move and/or rotate block?[/thread]
You can move a block (that is unoccupied, without a blocking stone, and uncovered by another block) [i]and[/i] place it in any orientation you want (assuming that it touches the structure and it is not the block moved by the previous player). Or you can rotate a block in place instead of moving it.

[u]Variants[/u]
Two-player game variant, to keep game from being too short:
You may want to allow each player two turns to move up before ending the game. Meaning there is one more round for placing blocks, before the game ends.

A unable to move higher
B unable to move higher
A unable again
B unable again
A still unable - game ends.

Great little game. Very intrigue mind game on figuring out your goals to win.  The components are great quality.  The ladders are made of sturdy wood construction.  The Blocks are solid  and colorful., while the players pieces are not small. The rules of the game are simple enough for quick learning.  The detractor to this game is the simplistic abstraction and lack of theme.  This is perhaps meant to be  a great kids game, but I would recommend it for adults, especially small party settings.

Charming pieces feature in this lunch pail abstract, and it plays fairly quickly. Faintly reminiscent of Jenga.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8/10):[/COLOR]

[i]I had never heard of The Climbers and was hesitant to play. Luckily a buddy of mine at our meet up told me he thought it'd be right up my alley and he was right. The Climbers is a huge spacial puzzle as you try and figure out how to move blocks around in order for your climber to move higher up the structure. I love how this game makes you think, I am a spacial thinker so I can't get enough of games like this. 

The production quality of the new edition is off the charts, the game is beautiful. The rules are simple, you could play this game with almost anyone, even with younger kids. Depending on the group this game could become very thought provoking as you not only think about your current turn, but also plan for future moves and try to screw your neighbor. 

I'm anxiously awaiting the release of The Climbers so I can get a copy and introduce it to my family. Definitely a game I'd highly recommend checking out![/i]

A nice looking and fun strategy game. You must end up on the top at the end. Play by moving a cube and then moving your character but you can only step on your color.

Caught me by surprise with this one. Very abstract even though it appears like a dexterity game. I have to say I very much enjoyed it and will have to look to getting a copy of it at one point.

Definitely would recommend and play this again.

This is a short filler abstract game where on your turn, you can move or rotate a brick from a pile of bricks, and then move your pawn up the mountain, walking only on your color or grey. Your pawn can only naturally move up half a brick worth of height. If you want to make a bigger jump, you spend your one time use ladder tokens. I played this first with 2 players, and It didn't really work. Then, later I played it with 4 and it was more interesting. I don't know that I'd put this in my favorites pile, but I'm interested to see how it plays with more experience and different groups of players.

An interesting spatial puzzler, that is almost more of a toy than a game. I am not sure there is a lot of strategy to it, more a question of tactics, but the winner can pretty much be decided by one or two moves in the end instead of any sort of long-term performance throughout the game. Maybe this is a good thing and the game would be too harsh if people would be eliminated too early but this means it also feels like you have less control. Still, the way it breaks the mold of your usual boardgame experience is definitely worth the time.

Played this one at PAX Unplugged 2017. Very easy to learn, even though the rulebook is not as good as it could be and we had to look up one or two things here on BGG -- once you know the rules, though, there's nothing to it. Very fun, looks good on the table. I enjoyed the extremely high level of player interaction -- you can really screw each other over at times. I also enjoyed the constantly shifting game state, as every player can move and rotate a block to anywhere else on the board (with a restriction or two) on his or her turn. Lots of fun, want to pick this one up.

this is a good, light on rules but heavy on tactics type abstract game.  However, unlike most abstracts in my opinion this is quite good and doesn't really need more theme pasted on.  Truly a hidden gem of a game as you are always think and trying to out guess your opponent.  Good wooden quality components that can withstand  outdoor play as long as it isn't too windy.   even with heavy thinkers this doesn't last more than an hour but some games might go as fast as 10 minutes.  Very glad to have this in my collection.

Players move a block and then climb. They can only climb one half-block at a time on the right colours. Eventually the blocks stack into a tower and it becomes impossible to get any higher. When this happens the player at the top wins. This was shown to me as a fun game for multiple players but there is actually quite a bit of thought to expend on thinking through moves and trying to ensure the right position.

When I saw the the colorfull blocks, cute ladders and meeples, I did not expect this  chess-like multiplayer game. When I played the i found out that the random setup rules have an enormous impact on who is going to win. Also, a random setup with these large blocks is impossible.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An abstract strategy game where you are moving blocks to allow your climber to head up the tower that is being built. You want to be the highest of all the players when the game ends. My issue with this game is when there are only two players. The game ends when both players aren't able to move up in a single round. So, if the player that is behind can't move up, then the leader can just not move up as well for the win. It was much harder to find ways to move up than I thought there would be. Our games ended very quickly.

RATING: 5
(+) There are opportunities for direct player interaction and manipulation of the game-state with cascading effects.  
(+) Simple ruleset (once elucidated). 
(+) Opacity in early game and the setup variability contribute to both depth and re-playabilty. 

(-) The pace of the game can plod slowly along for players spending time evaluating all avenues and options.  
(-) Suffers ergonomically (accessibility-wise) because of the strategically-driven need to see all sides of the structure.  
(-) Pink player imbalance (why is this even a thing?)

Neat simple 3D game of no chance, with interesting strategy. We enjoyed it and played several times the weekend we learned it (at [[Pionek]]). Big heavy solid cubes.

But the inability to easily see all the faces of the blocks, which is important, is a practical disadvantage for a pure strategy game.

It also seems the random setup can significantly favor or disfavor certain players.

We were taught sort of hastily at the con. The rules are fairly simple and easy to explain, but there seem to be some differences between the German rules we saw there and the English rules I found later online. Apparently the German rules had various ambiguities or holes, and the English rules cleaned them up, I gather. (E.g. do you move your pawn before moving a block? When everyone passes, does the next player get a final turn or not?) This is a drawback, having a game with different rule versions floating around.

I played it as many times, because I wanted to see if it's something more than nice, and fun taking and puting a cube and climbing higher. Finally I didn't buy it, because I think that skill in this game don't matters.

I was happy with this game. It hit like I hoped it would. I really enjoyed the tactile feel of the blocks and the brain burny way you figure out your turn. Played a four player game, and based on nothing I think that's probably the best player count. It was tense, we were in each other's way, and blocking each other. The game went on for about an hour and that was about the perfect length for something like this. I like it.

RATING: 5
The garish colors, kids-game look and kids-simple rules belie the tough abstract strategy in here. This game started out with a whimper, but things got really tight and tense near the summit. I find when to use the ladders and blocking stone tricky, and am not sure whether they are worth disrupting the elegance of the game, but the core gameplay is solid. Grab an early lead, fart out pieces so others can't follow in your path, then manipulate blocks into favorable alignments while you wait for them to get closer.

I like the aesthetic look of how skinny the tower is symbolizing how close to the end the game is.

This game at first glance looks like little kids playing with blocks, seeing who can build the best tower. But after jumping into it the game is very deep strategicaly and you have to look ahead to see what moves will best help you and destroy your neighbors. Good game, light and doesn't take long to play.

Really a clever idea for a game.  It is very tactical race game with a variable finish line -- up! It is creates a really compelling environment to play in. It is quite simple, a very neat interactive puzzle.   

I do fear that it will have a certain samey quality after a while.  Mostly I fear the designs' proclivity for kingmaker possibilities...

Perfect coffee shop game, as the wonderful wooden blocks build a really interesting tower.  I think there's some awesome decisions and spacial relationships to get your head around as you take your turn, and the way in which the tower changes over time is really interesting.  It's a gem that will rocket up the charts once it's released in the U.S.

UPDATE: Not super amazing after a few plays, but still find it a really cool game that is unique and I'm happy to have it in the collection.

RATING: 8
How many ways can you say "clever" or "deceptively simple"? You can nearly deduce the rules by looking at the pieces: blocks, ladders, and pawns. Substantial wooden pieces recall children's blocks. The careful, mathematical distribution of colored sides suggest more strategy than merely stacking. Play, lose, play just once more now that you've "got it all figured out".

RATING: 7
This is a preliminary rating based on a single play with 2 players, and in all fairness, I suspect that this game isn't at its best with only 2.  My rating for this game is still fairly high mainly due to the innovative design and the fantastic wood components, but the game play didn't quite grab me quite as much as I was expecting, for reasons that I'm not sure of.  I'd be interested to see if my rating would change after a couple more plays with more than 2 players.  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total: 7/10
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Players control pawns attempting to climb highest on a mountain of wooden blocks. Each turn players move a block and then their climber; climbers can only walk up half-steps, and only on faces of their own or the neutral colour. They also have (single-use) ladders enabling bigger steps up.

There's some room for collusion and for lots of dickish blocking, i.e. it's thoroughly enjoyable. It does lose some points for the troublesome ergonomics - it's obviously quite difficult to see the other side of the "mountain" from one side of the table, and even harder to see through the blocks to see which colours are behind or beneath.

For such a simple game it's frustrating that there are so many versions of the rules around. I prefer the variant that allows players to move at any time as it makes the use of grey blocks more interesting.

The Climbers has a big "Wow!" factor for the way it looks on the table, a tower of multicolored and multishaped building blocks which rise higher and higher as the game goes on.  It is not, however, as you would suspect on first glimpse, a dexterity game; the tower does not teeter and fall.  Instead each player moves one of the lower blocks to the top of the tower in order to position its color in such a way that his own climber of that color can continue to ascend to its ever-changing summit.  The winner is the player who, with the help of his couple of ladders, manages to finish at the top.  The tactics are not especially brain-burning, but they are charming in that they are genuinely 3-D and physically realized.

Bought at Essen '17. A very unique game, which is visually very appealing. And has a very easy gameplay. After one game, I see its potential. Some very clever moves can be made in this game. We ended up standing around the table and sometimes walking around it to look at it from another angle. Very glad I picked this one up.

It [i]sounds[/i] simple enough: each turn you can move your pawn, move a block and move your pawn again - as long as you end your turn higher than when you started. Of course, once you start playing you discover that although other players [i]could[/i] help you, they're usually more interested in clawing their own way up to the top. Lovely, tactile, blocks.

A very unusual, 3D spatial competitive puzzle game. I'm not sure how much this would stand up to repeat plays, but I'm keen to try it at least a few more times to fully wrap my head around it.

Update: You can't win this game in the first round but you can certainly lose it. If everyone else decides to build/climb together and you end up away from them, you are almost certainly doomed. This game also seems to fall a little flat toward the end with less happening as the game draws to a close.

Rating down from 7.6 to 6.

03 DEC 2010 - Wow this game IS really cool, challenging and fun! Played earlier this year and had a blast. The interesting thing is that the deepness of the game is not immediately apparent. This looks like a simple almost childish. But, the further up you climb, the more you realize how truly difficult it is - almost like going for a Mt. climb for real. The really interesting part is cooperating with someone else to get yourself higher, then having to back-stab them later to get ahead of them. Do not miss an opportunity to play this great game!

I love the pieces. Makes this one a joy.  It really benefits from playing on a large "lazy Susan".

Update: Played this recently and rating goes up from 7 to 7.5.  Though it works well with only two, I especially like it with more. 

Climbers is pretty easy to get to the table - teach it in 5 minutes, looks awesome and scales well from 2-5 players. 




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 4
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 1.5

This game really surprised me. What looks like a dexterity game at first, or perhaps a child's game, is actually nothing of the sort. You're trying to navigate to the top while keeping other players from getting to the top, by subtly and skillfully moving blocks around the mountain to maintain supremacy. I've played twice with three players so far, and in both games we were laughing riotously and enjoying the neat situations we found our climbers in.

"As with many games, when someone gets ahead, the others struggle to catch up by helping each other or hindering the leader.

In a 3-player game I recently played of The Climbers, I was leading and a second player was further behind than the two of us. She was convinced she would lose, so I convinced her to work with the other player to keep the game going, even if that meant helping the other losing player. Using that strategy, she was able to eventually win the game. Because there is always a clear leader in The Climbers, it is usually easy to see with whom one should ally, and cooperation is the best path (rope teams) to overtaking the leader. Exclusive self-interest will more often lead to kingmaking. A strategy of mixed cooperation and self-interest is not common among games, but important for success in this one, I find. "

I played this expecting to savage it with "too light, not interested in abstracts," but I have to say the play was surprisingly neat.  It was four gamers, and we still had fun with it.  Not sure it would hold up to many plays, but also not sure it wouldn't.  The pieces are definitely gorgeous, and the little Fisher-Price style people and ladders are perfect.  Definitely something I would consider buying if I was more into abstracts.  A good example of a multiplayer abstract that works without the problem of "we'll screw you, while the other player wins."

Based on one play. A beautiful game with chunky colourful blocks and adorable wooden ladders. The idea is to get your pawn to the top of a tower of wooden blocks using one-shot ladders while blocking your opponent.

Our first two-player play degraded into hysterical laughter as our pawns competed to scale a Jenga-like narrow wooden tower. The sort of classic game you can imagine your grandchildren playing.

I'm not convinced that this is quite as deep of a strategy game as some folks are trumpeting, but I will say it is quite a conversation piece. Watching a bunch of neckbeards huddle around a set of kids building blocks with furrowed brows is pretty funny, after all. My only real criticism is that the game should come with a lazy Susan, otherwise it is kind of a pain to play on a full-size gaming table.

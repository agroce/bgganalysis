GAME: Blood Bowl (Second Edition)
RANK: 1589
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Though the third edition and the living rulebook (4th edition) are wonderful games, I still have a soft spot in my heart for this version.

It plays slightly differently than the more recent editions, but it is very fun.

One particular treat in this set is the "astrogranite" playing surface.

Man, I loved the look and feel of this game, and was really intrigued by the concept, so I desperately wanted to love playing it. Unfortunately the game play and mechanics are not that fun. It takes too long to set up, create a team, and take turns, all leading up to... what? Formalized combat? Combat football? It does neither of those that well. One of the main things it has going for it is that it's a lot better in terms of play than the first edition, which really plodded. If I have the chance to play with somebody who wants to get into the roleplaying of the teams/characters/world, and maybe even paint the pieces and all that, I might give it a go. But it would be hard to justify given all the other great games out there. Note: I haven't looked at or tried the "living rules," which apparently make things much better.

Trade info: Board is in good nick, al the rest is in questionable condition, bought to run through the rules again and see if the wife would play.

Happy to include as a makeweight in trade for those who want the foam board, which is in good condition

Includes some of the expansion, but this is in poor condition also.

I always liked this game; maybe I like it too much! But the idea of fantasy football is appealing, and the rules are nice, although in this second edition with all the supplemental rules the game becomes a bit too slow.

Lots of fun in a championship with the "ever losers" skeletons.
I think that, nowadays, I couldn't stand the unbalanced rules and basic illustrations, thus my rating lesser than 7.

Rules are worse than the third edition, but there's a lot more humour to be found. Some rules are completely ridiculous, but add greatly to the atmosphere. A fantasy ball-game should be unpredictable. In this edition not all teams are of equal strength which is really fun actually!

Blood Bowl is fabulous (get the Living Rulebook today if you are interested).  1st Edition was unplayable; 2nd Edition was better, but still a bit of a mess.  Not really sure why anyone would play 2E these days.

Finally bought a copy (used, off Craigslist) and have yet to play it.  Took 25 years to get to the point of buying a copy, hopefully it will be less time before playing a game.  Owning this game is all about nostalgia at this point.  Back in university this was weekly gaming.  I understand the rules are a bit different now so playing right away isn't an option without a good read through the current rule set.

Funny 'fantasy' football tabletop game: most similar to rugby as the gameflow is continue and not play-to-play like american football, but with the chance to throw the ball among all the gamefield. Very beautiful plastic miniatures to paint. Good materials like gameboards, sheets, dice, like all GW products from '80-'90.

2nd edition is good, but when you see the unstopable block of Dwarves slowly grinding up the field, you realise there's something not quite right about the rules.

RATING: 7
A game where you line up your players and then try and knock 'em down. Lends its self of desperate gameplay as you try and cross the line with the ball. Due to its violent nature and the fact that it is strictly a two player game, I have difficulty in finding opponents.

UPDATE - You know what?  I love this game.  It's worth its length.  Leagues are the way to go however.  They are the only way to properly get the flavor.  The PC game is an excellent way to experience the fun of the leagues.

Many great hours spent in league play and one-off games.  A fine mix of football and fantasy violence.  Too long to play for what it is, I'm afraid.

I used to enjoy this quite a lot when I was younger. Mostly I played one off games but I did play in a league once which was kind of interesting. I played Elves and so tended to concentrate on passing moves more than running with the ball.

Bloodbowl gets a makeover. This time with citadel miniatures for the players, and a cool looking 3-piece polystyrene astro-granite pitch.

Blood Bowl while an odd duck of a game just seems to hit me perfectly when it comes to theme. American Football with fantasy races. It's like peanut butter and chocolate mixed into a bowl of nostalgia garnished with joy. The gameplay itself, while occasionally (ok often) luck based, and not always balanced (halflings versus dark elves comes to mind) the game just tickles the fun parts of the brain.

Same as First edition with rules clarifications and plastic minis replacing cardboard ones.

One may regret that you have only minis to play two races team (instead of cardboard tiles to play plenty of teams in the initial box). But, you will mostly regret the previous full cardboard because the gameboard is now 3D polyester and not that adequate for playing.

A whole lot of fun as long as you can start a league.  Rating would be more along the lines of 7 if just played as a single game.

*Update* Now rated a 7 all around. The re-playability really starts to wear thin after a bunch of games. I find myself dreading when it's time to play again when I've played through most of a season. It's still fun but I just don't like the repetitive nature of long drawn out seasons. Especially when you see how things are stacked against you at times. The bonuses for having a weaker team don't seem to stack up and balance the difference in team experience.

OK, for a change of pace.  My kids like it so I play it.
11-27-2009: Changed my rating to a 1 (from a 6) because GW had BGG remove ALL user generated files. There was some great stuff by fans that GW thinks infringes on their intellectual property.

I played in a Blood Bowl 2nd edition campaign once.  Most of the players dropped out by the third week, due to having no competitive ability any more.

Hace mucho que no juego, pero tengo buenísimos recuerdos de este juego. La liga con 6 jugadores y 4 equipos por jugador fue lo mejor de aquel verano. Estaría dispuesto a repetir la experiencia siempre. 

Sobresale en el aspecto táctico. Los dos libros de expansión revolucionaron el juego con las reglas para ligas y jugadores estrella. Es uno de los juegos más divertidos de ver jugar que conozco.

Del orden de 100-200 partidas sin loguear.

UPDATE: La puntuación tiene en cuenta el companion y el star players. Sin estos complementos se quedaría en un 5.

The astro-granite was such a neat looking board and the game was good too. However it's more of a brawler than the 3rd edition. That's not a bad thing if you like your football extremely violent get this version and slam your opponents head onto that cement turf. That'll bloody them every time. Loved playing this with a chainsaw wielding maniac and chopping off the opponenets head {assuming you didn't chop your own} and running that head across the goal for extra points. The minis are not as good as the newer version but was hands down better than chits. Those Ork cheerleaders sure are ugly, no wonder Orks are so mean, I mean if my wife looked like that......UUUMMMMM, hold on a minute, maybe that would explain a few of my mood swings.

Very enjoyable football game.  The different races gives you a way to play any style of team.  If you can play a league where you can continue to grow your team.  This can make it hard for newer players to get in but it is worth it.

This was great fun in its day when playing in a league.  It's now outmoded by the Living Rulebook and 3rd edition before that.  Still, if it was the only version of Bloodbowl available, I'd play it.

Play this with the 3rd edition rules.  One of the scant few GW games that still gets a little official support.  Also, one of the best 2-player board games out there, period.  This is almost the perfect blend of strategy and luck.  Also, the theme is absolutely badass.

Typical play by play:  Ok folks Mike and Jeff have been playing for three hours.  We still have the same 16 players laying in the middle of the pitch... ooops what just happened.  Did Ulrok Neakytoz just get the ball past center field... ouch... nope I guess not.

This game took forever.... and then some.  But it was still fun.

RATING: 5.5
When I was younger, Blood Bowl was a game that didn't get my attention much.  Now that I am all grown up, I must admit that it doesn't get my attention much more...which isn't to say it's a bad game but just that it takes a very particular crowd to enjoy this one.

The mechanism is a bit fiddly for a miniature game, which tends to diminish the fun factor.

The game of American Football gets the Games Workshop treatment and can be played with fantasy races. Scoring is ok but the game encourages as much maiming and killing of the opposition as possible. Plays best when a league is formed and a team can be built and grow over time. A personal favourite.

We played this one a lot when we were kids.  Mayhem and violence.  It was great.  But I would never play it again.

The game was too slow and complex.  Unbalanced and unfair to the extreme.  Good for kids who don't understand or appreciate game balance perhaps, but a horrible design indeed.

The 3rd edition is great. It fast and way more fair. I would never go back to this version of the game.

The second edition of Blood Bowl was a favorite for me back in the late 1980s. I still have my copy and it's in surprisingly good shape considering that it's 28 years old now!

Bit sad to let this one go (26 years of nostalgia), but couldn't justify keeping a game I'd most probably never play again - even with my son. Didn't quite get into it back in the time. Excessive dice rolls and just too long. Was thinking of starting again until someone mentioned it took three hours to play a game! Too long for a dice chucker. Love the BB world though, so happy that I have Team Manager.

Olskool version of this now great game. Rating is based on theme and my experiences with the game as a teenager (didn't care too much how the game played back then).

Very long game where you move all of your players, then bash the opposition - basically warhammer on  a football field.

The most brilliant thing done in the 3. edition is the turn over rule, making this tedious monster into a pulse driven, nail biting experience with lots of tough choices.

My first Blood Bowl matches were played with this version, but it was with third edition that I fell in love with the game.
In my memories this edition was more complicated (many unnecessary rules just for the love of small detail), deadly (tons of elves and goblins killed or permanently disabled) and flawed than the following one, which in my opinion gave much more enjoyable gaming experiences.
After a few plays we realized that drives on the left side of the pitch could be easily countered by the timely entering of the reserves, so we concentrated all drives on the right side, and of course this spoiled the game, greatly limiting the viable tactics.
My rating is an average between my wish to play this version (never again - I would rather play 3rd edition) and a tribute to the edition that introduced me to a game which for a few years became a part of my life

I cut my teeth on the cardboard pitch and standup 'figures' from the previous edition, but this one jumped into real 3D with astrogranite and proper miniatures!

I spent ages crafting my team, what with the superstars add-on and while the game has it's annoying random foul-ups, well, that's the crazy world of Warhammer isn't it? (not all good)

Still, it can be fun - dont understand anyone rating it a ten though

Had a 4 team league going in high school with some modified rules that we made up.  I don't remember exactly but it involved a shorter field (middle section removed) and a down system of plays.  I do remember having a great time with the league although my friends cousin ended up moving away before we finished the season.  He also left his copy of the game at my house and said he didn't want it back.  So I have 2 copies of this game.  The foam board in this edition is fantastic.

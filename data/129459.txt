Giant cluster of RNG, but it's a lot of fun if you go in knowing it and don't care to win, which can be rare.  The rules can be cumbersome at times though.

A rather disappointing experience. Fantastic components but too long and fiddly for what it is with a lot of complexity in learning the game and setting it up and yet there was little interesting to do in play. I thought the depth to complexity ratio was poor. Although there are opposing sides it feels a bit like a co-operative game with one person on each side making most of the decisions. 
If you enjoy chaotic games and can just enjoy the ride this may work for you but after peeking at my watch for 4+ hours I was highly relieved when the host called the evening and I could put this one behind me.

This is every holiday wrapped in a box. That's not hyperbole. And that's not an overstatement. And that ain't no lie.

Disregarding that previous paragraph, but maintaining the point, Duel of Ages 2, crams an enormous amount of content into a relatively simple game. The premise is absolutely ridiculous (in the best way) and allows for the most hilarious scenarios in all of gaming. The game is just intrinsically funny. Mages wearing football helmets, Annie Oakley sporting a bazooka, and William Wallace riding a bicycle are just some of absolutely surprising and strange sights you may see (MAY SEE - there are an enormous amount of random combinations in this game).

What you have is a light war game, designed in a modular way, with random adventures, card driven mechanics, and tactical unit movement. When you're not smiling at the weird events, you're puzzling over how best to maneuver for points and combat. The base game has a ludicrous amount of content, but if you add the Master Set, you'll be getting a game that will last you a lifetime. There is just soooooo much.

JK. I am in no position to really rate this game as of now.

However I guess it's true now when I so far haven't even played it... At the moment I always want to play it (may expect that to change though =P), but should ratings be changed with experience? If so this rating is free to change :)

This game is a ridiculous experience. Kind of like the 'sharknado' of games. Full of fiddly rules that read like something from a 1977 Avalon Hill war game before it got to the editors desk. So much complexity for very little benefit, as most things that happen, feel almost totally random. Very little strategy is possible. A huge variance of power between cards of a similar type. At the end of the day, that this game has a good ranking is the single most surprising thing I have ever seen on BGG.

Juego básico + Master Set.
Este juego es increíble. Los personajes son variados y derrochan carisma por los cuatro costados. Hay cartas de equipo como para no repetir en toda la vida. Las aventuras son originales y variadas. Una vez explicado lo básico el juego es muy sencillo aunque requiere de algo de estrategia y saber aprovechar las características de tus personajes para sacarle el máximo partido.
Lo mejor de todo es que durante cada partida se suceden un montón de historias y de situaciones geniales que, quieras o no, recordarás durante bastante tiempo.

Like the portion of exploration very much in this game. Plus with the Master Set there is a whole lot of treasures to be seized before any shuffling takes place.

The fact that the map changes and that the keylock system allows the maps to be pretty modular.

The mechanics are screwed up. If you go to an item, there is a strong chance that you won't be able to pick it up. Don't play anything except a melee character because you start without any equipment. The characters are less balanced than the typical game with variable player powers. Do yourself a favor and play HeroScape instead.

I love adventure games. I thought DOA1 was going to be up my alley but never played it. I finally got to play DOA2 and was very disappointed.

I played two characters in a 6 player game with 30 to 40 minutes between turns. All decisions were obvious. It took an hour or more to arrive at the correct location to make any rolls...whether they failed or succeeded, I have no idea. I was too bored to remember.

This game looks like it was printed in the past and stored in a warehouse that said "Do not open until 2013"

Only played it twice and it wasn't what I was looking for. There is a lot of luck involved in this game. The theme is pretty cool and I like the skirmish setup.

That being said, in my opinion Earth Reborn does everything that this game wants to accomplish much much better. The difference is that Earth Reborn is a game of tactics whereas Duel of Ages II is a game of luck. The only advantage that Duel of Ages II has is that it is much shorter.

What an amazing game! I had played version 1, but it was competing with too many games back then. Now I am looking for replayability and theme and relatively short playing time (2-3 hours). This game meets and exeeds all my expectations. It is my favorite game of all time and all I want to do is play it!

 Ive gotten 23 games in and the deand tactical gameplay is very good. Lots of information to process and lots of tough choces. Combat is important but only one part. The game is a little silly and I just have fun while playing this.  however I also feel like the game is challenging mentally which is a good thing.

RATING: 5
The quality is a huge step up from DOA I as are many of the game changes (e.g. equipment categories and skills), but core game itself changed substantially for the worse. It's just all about cards, cards, cards now. There are SO many starting cards in the game now and a massive rampup in labyrinth adventures for even more cards. It just makes the game an exercise in chaos. 

DOA1 had a lot of planning and maneuver, you could make a plan and follow through, adjusting as you go. DOA2 gives out so much equipment you can't make any long term plans or some cube, or gun, or Lith Secret will screw it up. A little chaos is good. A lot is, well, just chaos. The entire game becomes turn-by-turn tactical rather than strategic.

It also got more fiddly. Partly the large ramp up in equipment on the board, but also various status effects you have to remember. And, on top of that, the new labyrinth bonuses amplify the problem of a someone gaining a decent lead. 

DoA1 was a 9. A perfect 10 for me on the game play, but minus 1 point for components.

Doa2 is a 5 for the reverse reason. Great components, but the game play is more combat heavy, chaotic, fiddly, and luck driven.

A super random luck-fest. But what a super random luck-fest it is. It's easy to get immersed in the thematic humor of Geronimo riding a mountain bike and firing a bazooka at a space alien. The gameplay is reminiscent of a MOBA video game (League of Legends, etc...) and really does a good job of giving you a wide open space to play in.

RATING: 10
From my review:
Duel of Ages isn’t for everyone, but I think it is for more gamers than might realize it. At its core there is an interesting wargame here, filled with opportunity fire and equipment profiles. It is a wargame that rewards planning and sound strategy. It is also a wargame that shouldn't be judged just as a "wargame" in the modern cliquish sense. The design demonstrates that early Avalon Hill ethos that suggested that games, even if the happened to be about war, could reach a mass audience, despite their funny counters and unadorned rulebooks. 

Yet, there is something just beyond the wargame here too. The sound machine heart of the game generates more energy than they would appear capable of, and that extra power expresses itself in the profusion of stories that that it looses. Without an apparent care for themematic coherency, this game builds remarkably cogent tales which enlist the cultural memory of its players to create something their own. 

The second edition demonstrates a deep commitment, without compromise, to the qualities that made the original so great. In sensibility, it’s like nothing I’ve seen recently (especially from the genre). It is a game deeply out-of-step with the designs of the present moment, and is all the better for it. 


Qualification:  I enjoyed DoA1 but was never a super fan.  I thought the game was fun, silly, and I admired the vision and integrity of the designers.  It had been about five years since I last played the game when I stumbled on to news about DoAII.  I was intrigued.  My collection and plays had taken a hard turn away from the Ameritrash dice fests and towards purer games of the 18xx variety.  

Accordingly there was a hole in my collection for a game like DoA and, more importantly, demand from my group for a game like it.  I ordered and a few days later it arrived at my doorstep.

Components:

Gorgeous.  I'm no fan of computer-generated artboards but these are pretty well done.  Even the ones that are less-than-stellar kinda work in the early 00s kitchy video-game aesthetic of the maps.  The cards are very well laid out and easy to read from across the table.  The are also of a very fine stock, easy to shuffle and clearly durable.  All of the counters and platters are mounted no a thick chipboard similar to something you might see from Queen Games.  The map locks together beautifully with minimal warp (I noticed just a bit of difference but I imagine it will flatten with use).  With the extra platters I do not know how I'm going to store this game.

Gameplay:

Sharp, and well-tested.  The characters appear both rich and balanced, providing a wonderful tour of their game system.  This game is clearly a labor of love by a capable designer.  Despite being a "new" system, it also very clearly displays a polish that could have only been produced by 10 years of development and design work.  The game feels a little faster than it's older brother but it could also be easily throttled down for those looking for something closer to the classic pace.  

Other Remarks.

1. The game is very easy to teach.  I taught my wife the basics in a few minutes and we were playing the Triad scenario in ten.

2. The basic game is outrageously expansive.  There is plenty of game to be had there.

3. Despite the price, this game is a huge value.  Fear for your shelves, this game is heavy.  

4. In my review I mentioned how many of the scenarios felt similar.  This was only a reflection on my lack of play.  There is a decidedly different feel to each and every setup.

5. The characters are very, very different and each have interesting capabilities and can shine given the right light.

Plus Master and Collector sets.

Unusual doesn't even begin to describe this blender of several game types. Not for everybody, but if it is, it will suck you in with its humor and phenomenal narrative that each game generates.

Production values are excellent, and the Master Set (really, it's a massive expansion) adds tons of content.

Note: Take the player/time/tile recommendations in the living rulebook seriously (available for download at the official website). Playing too few characters on too large a map in too little time left many people walking away from the first edition in disgust, which is a shame. You need the proper balance to experience the myriad interactions and game narrative.

After playing tutorial 1 and 3 numerous times with several people, I finally got a Triad game happening with Master Set content. Speechless. I wish I lived a billionaire self-retired lifestyle so I can play this game for the rest of my life. I'd pay people to play with me at absurd times of the day or night just to satiate my craving.

I need to go deeper with this. I need to see at least 3/4 of the cards. I need to see what crazy map setups can happen. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Setup is very much a game of itself, but once you get going into the actual game the experience is unmatched.

This game gets it.  If you have a group or a least one opponent who likes heavy amerithrash games this is it.  Team vs. team arena combat.  You grab a team of guys from mythological past to normal future to super scifi guys, smash them together along with equipment they can get and just go.  Each team has a base while you also send your guys out to do quests and battle each other.  You can stack your team and raid the opponents base.  Did they capture a couple of your team mates?  Send a guy to infiltrate and then bust them out.
If you want a game that will give you a great story every time you play this is what you want.  The game length is veritable, anywhere from 2 - 20 hours, the size is as well, and it plays a wide range of players.  Works best with two even teams and probably best at 1v1, but can be adapted and have fun at really whatever amount.

I played the old DOA back when, warped platters and all, and loved that too, but I have to say, I like this better.  The same feel is there, but the fiddliness is greatly reduced.  Love it.  Love it.

There's something about this game that makes it instantly appealing and unappealing at the same time.  Its ruleset makes sense, but some of the stuff it describes doesn't.  The theme of historical/fictional figures duking it out on futuristic TV (or its equivalent) is awesome, but there's pretty much no reason to be doing so.

At any rate, this is a minis game without the minis and that's fine by me.  I am an imaginative sort so it doesn't bother me that there's no little plastic dudes running around (instead, you have little discs).  I'm not completely sold on the cards-instead-of-dice resolution system but it does work out pretty awesomely when it's totally messing with the opponent.

Anyways, I'm certain this thing will grow on me if I can get more chances to play it.

DOA 1 was easily my favourite game of all time & DOA 2 is even better in almost every respect.  The myriad of tactical decisions are extremely interesting & unique in each & every game. The characters have a distinct personality & individual strengths/weaknesses & a rich history that satisfies my role-playing itch. There are many unpredictable random elements & yet the player who optimizes each & every turn with whatever resources he/she has available is usually the winner. My friend and I have played hundreds & hundreds of hours since the inception of DOA & it is just as fresh & exciting now as when we 1st started. DOA is simply flat-out fun & our creative juices have been further energized with the greatly improved DOA 2. I am not a gaming neophyte ---- I know a superior product when I see it & play it. I have 30 years of boardgaming experience starting with Blitzkrieg by Avalon Hill & now own several hundred games ---- everything from Kingmaker to Advanced Squad Leader. My personal favourites aside from DOA 2 are Arkham Horror (my #2 game), Conflict of Heroes, Mage Knight, Twilight Struggle, War of Indines, Mage Wars, & two collectable card games (Warlord & Magic the Gathering). All great games but DOA 2 is in a class by itself.

The perfect game for me. It has a wargame backbone (op fire, line of sight, terrain effects) but adds a layer of objectives and "achievement" scoring that make it feel like a sandbox video game. A perfect cocktail of immersion, tactics, and entertainment. It almost feels like a more macro version of Earth Reborn: it's on a larger scale but offers similar amounts of freedom without the extra gamey layers of command points and blind bidding. The thematic vibe was best described by my son as "Hunger Games: The Board Game".

I can appreciate this game, but it's a fairly complex skirmish wargame that I'm unlikely to seek out. I would be willing to play it again if it came out, but that's unlikely since no one in the local group owns it.

Looks intriguing & a walloping good time, but also very clunky. Not sure at this point if I wish to invest time and table space on this- I would if I had the right group. I can't help but think this would be a great computer game idea, rather than a board game.

That being said, it's a great choice for that niche group who wants something completely unique. From tactical combat, to exploration, to an incredible assortment of characters to choose from, DOAII offers what no other game can.

RATING: 6.5
Initial rating. Much better than Arkham Horror. The RPG-ish feel comes across well. I especially enjoyed the thematic craziness of it all, the weird combinations of characters and equipment. The combat system incorporating the different stats and cards seemed awkward at first but worked and felt smooth after a turn or two. I also like the artistic style of the illustrations, it feels old-school.
-----------------------------------------
This is an exceptional game.

I love a game that tells a story, and this one definitely does. It's a pretty silly story, but who cares? My first game I had Annie Oakley hiding in a forest with some sort of laser rifle and a pet cheetah. Silly? Yes. Awesome? Definitely.

I also happen to think the challenge resolution mechanism is super clever.

So far, I am super impressed with the new edition. The components blow the old game away, and the gameplay has been tightened significantly. I can't point to a single thing I preferred in doa 1. Everything here is better.

Update - Never got it to the table much. Traded.

It seems like this would have been a monster hit in the late 1970s or early 1980s but is largely a snorefest by today's gaming standards.  There are few in any interesteing decisions to be made and the downtime between turns in interminable.  If you have an unlucky random placement for a character on the map you can find yourself taking an hour to get him/her to a place where they can participate only to have a bad die roll (on a quest) and be banished back to the far reaches of the map. The character cards are wonderful and the premise of the game sounds fun but the game behind it is quite lacking.

Lightish tactical "wargame".
Characters are a lot of fun while no character is too crazy. It feels like a Moba (multiplayer-online-battle-arena) game.
I found the respawn mechanic a bit to random for me, and the fights could have been more predominant, because as it is you get the most points by fulfilling quests and that by itself is not as exiting as battling the enemy team..

But I would play it again, if it comes up.

This game could be categorized as Ameritrash, but the game is just trash.  You have almost no illusion of agency, the ridiculous deck of combat outcomes dictates the entire game.

Your card is covered in stats, you really only need 3 or 4 but to add arbitrary complexity (this abates once you learn the game and ignore the 18 boxes with numbers that don't matter at the moment).

The game is nothing novel, and you don't really develop your character.  You hope for a good weapon and if you get a horse or some sneakers then too bad for you.

I am perplexed as anyone as to how this game could get so many 10s from people.

We're 5 plays in now, 3 trials and the first 2 missions. Every game has been a very tight and exciting race. The mechanics work beautifully. The characters really stand out, not one that we've played with seemed generic, each one has had its chance to shine. I love how well the different game styles work together: part war game, part adventure game, at times it can even feel a little like a sports game. Running to the lith's chamber with an offering while being chased by a group of enemies, almost like a twisted surreal basketball breakaway.
This is a somewhat heavy game though (literally and figuratively), at any one moment there are a fair number of things to remember, consider, work out, etc. so, as with any game worth playing, mental acuity is required. Having said that, no one facet of this game is at all difficult to understand on its own.
This is really setting up to be one of my all time favs.

It takes a bit of a commitment to get your money's worth out of this game, but it's a ton of time-fractured, pan-galactic, adventuring fun. If it catches your fancy, definitely consider adding in the Master Set. So many characters, so much equipment... it's a blast.

It will probably always be a top 3 for me.  Until/unless this second edition knocks it down a notch!   :)


*********************************************************

Update after finally playing a great introductory game with my wife.  She was learning, but enjoyed it enough to play again!  :)  Big win for me...as she would never consider the 1st edition.

2nd edition is everything the 1st was and more.  
More card drawing opps, more opportunities for VPs (achievement points) better distribution of cards, what with 3 decks.  More, more and more of EVERYTHING!

I cannot explain how awesome this is without gushing.

Original comment >> Love it! The components now match the experience. Extremely smart changes have been made to the original. It has  the same engaging gameplay but is more streamlined, with more variety and more strategic options. 

It is a cliche but it would be very hard to go back to DoAI now.

New comment 18/04/2016 >>

Couldn't gain group traction with this game as I had hoped. My low-luck group just couldn't deal with the randomness. 

The card combat is not quite as engaging for me as the dice from the original. Also Initiative in combat adds another stat comparison which slows the game a little bit. I think I prefer the simultaneous combat of the original version.

On the whole though, I just want to play this!! Still a 10.

Arguably, I won't make that mistake again, but this made it hard for me to get into the game.

The changes don't seem all that drastic to me, based on a demo copy I played at BGG.CON 2012. Cards instead of dice for combat and challenge resolution. Is this an improvement? Eh, maybe. I like dice, so that's not something I care about. Different procedure for characters entering the game. Wasn't an issue for me about the original version. Besides, you can just--gasp--bring them in faster if you want, without buying an entirely new product.

I've not seen anything that will compel me to buy it, considering how much I spent acquiring every single available thing for the original incarnation. I'll wait and see.

For a game that has been praised for how much variety it has, I have to admit that it was a bit of a letdown. Those who can get into the fact that you're throwing all these elements into a blender are probably going to really enjoy this. For someone like me who is a bit more focused on the mechanical aspects, this game is merely just an okay skirmish-style game. I'm not a fan of card-driven combat usually, and the game's depth is pretty shallow compared to what you would expect it to be. I would rather play Nexus Ops or one of the Commands and Colors games.

--- Preliminary thoughts ---

Whimsical exercise of imagination combining characters and items from diverse eras. It is a potpourri of cards, missions, etc, that lacks focus.

Mix of light wargame and adventure game. Very long games, long downtimes while you wait for the others and too random.

Replayability is very high, because of large ammount of components. No games will be the same.

It's a game for very specific people, and I'm not one of them.

So, you're in an arena, with all kinds of different historical and fantasy and sci-fi characters.  You make teams of these characters, battle it out, find loot and seize objectives.  This whole premise doesn't much appeal to me so that's a large factor in my rating.

I taught this game to a number of people most of whom seemed intrigued by it.  No one was really clamoring to play it again though.

Well now ... tons of stuff, especially if you get the master set.  Has some elements war gamers will be familiar with, like terrain types, line of sight and so on.  There's quite a bit of work involved in learning the rules as this is a heavier game for sure.  Also, luck is a pretty big factor.

So, I'm glad I had the chance to learn the rules, play a couple of times just to see how it worked.

I love so many things about this game. I love building the map and picking teams. I love all the great character abilities and items and how thematic everything is. I love the innovative challenge deck and how it is tied into everything. It feels very different than anything else I’ve played. When so many things get recycled in gaming an original stands out so much more.

We only have two games under our belt so far, but we are enjoying it quite a bit. Tons of replayability in the basic set, but we are already considering the master set. Plays better as a team vs team rather than a 2 player game due to the ammount of things going on in our opinions, but that could be just part of the learning curve.

A game with grand ambition. A mass of different characters, a mass of items to collect, a mass of other cards which alter things along the way. And any game you might see 1% of them. Add to that a ton of different scenarios which reward different approaches. The game is pretty intuitive once you get into the flow ... do a move or a ranged attack, resolve any ranged attacks against those who moved (which is pretty rare), do any melee same space attacks, then resolve any adventure spaces you landed on. Attacks are compare this symbol to that (based on the type of attack), determine the difference, and flip a card which will randomly decide whether that difference is enough to hit or miss. If it's a hit, do the same process using other symbols (power vs armor). Which is pleasingly weightedly random, allowing for surprise. The aim is mostly to get onto adventure spaces and beat them, which is the same process, compare your value in the adventure's symbol to your own, flip a card and see the result based on the difference. Which is less pleasingly random because the consequences are greater. If you win, you're well on the way towards securing a VP (where a bunch of VP's are the most wins in each adventure type). If you lose, you're kicked off to the other side of the board and need to work your way back to try again. Get lucky a few times to start with and you're well on the way to victory. Get unlucky consistently on these important flips and, well, you're playing for the experience. The trick is to get the right characters with the right levels to the right adventure flips - but it's easier said than done given the scale of the map. There's a lot of tactically smart things to think about with your movement and placement given all the terrain considerations in the game. While I enjoyed learning the system and playing along, in the end I'm not sure I'll invest as it all seemed to get a bit same-y the further it went along into the scenario. You could see what needed to happen to get the next VP, it just took a long time to get to that point, and even longer if you're unlucky. I can definitely see why other people love it though given the large-scale scope it offers.

I see the potential in this game. The most basic mission seemed a bit basic, but it gave most of the what was needed to get up and going. I can't wait to play the ranged mission and get on to the actual game. Melee was alright, but ranged looks even cooler.

Waiting to add in the Master Set because I want to get the full flavor of the basic set.

This is an intimidating looking game, but it was so much fun. We did the first eight rounds of the "Rush" Scenario, which is the first scenario in the book past the tutorials. The time really just flew by. It was random, but not too random. Full of flavor at every turn. I think the aspect I liked the best was to visualize the characters and scenarios in my head. On paper, it felt like this was everything i wanted from a casual adventure game.
Here's the thing though. This game is a huge abstract pile of boards, tokens and cards. There are no dice for combat, but the randomness of the battle cards is randomness just the same. I rarely get to play 2 player games, and while this game isn't strictly 2 player, it is designed with 2 players in mind. Adding more adds little to the experience. With a lengthy setup/breakdown, a dense rules set and unappealing components, I knew I'd never or rarely get it to the table.

RATING: 9
A madcap mashup of squad leader, the Hunger Games, and that episode of Star Trek where Kirk and Spock team up with Abe Lincoln to fight Ghengis Khan and the rest. Tactically, it's all about teamwork and finding the best characters to fulfil rolls as strikers, runners, adventurers, etc. If the notion of a colonial financier in powdered wig sneaking around in a camouflage suit, and unleashing a bengal tiger on foes trying to break into his cavern base is the kind of thing that strikes your fancy, this is your game. The wealth of characters, treasures, and adventures is staggering. The effectiveness of characters is largely contextual, and the challenge comes in trying to match the character abilities to the situational context. In that sense, it's more like an RPG than a typical boardgame. But really, there's nothing else like it. Something this idiosyncratic could only have been the product of a single imagination, not a commercial team.

RATING: 7.5
Dual of Ages II has one of the most confusing rulebooks I've ever had to deal with, walking the player through multiple 'missions' with pre-selected characters and tons of rules and conditions about what card to draw and not draw to have separate introductions for melee and ranged combat, without every actually simply having a section of the book to explain the basic 'how this works'. It feels like they were trying to copy the 'tutorial mission' approach of a video game, and made things far more confusing than necessary as a result.

If you do manage to power through the manual's tutorials long enough to learn the game, you'll find a game that's fun to play, offers great variety, and is easy to make custom scenarios for. One of my groups favorites that I do is a 'dangerous game' scenario that pits a group of 4 dark-ages characters against a pair of far better armed future-era 'hunters'.

All in all, fun game, and fun game to create with, terrible rulebook, and a bit expensive for what you get, in all honesty.

(Basic game plus Master Set)
I enjoy this game quite a lot. The character stories are well written, and the variety of character and equipment combinations is endlessly amusing. There is a high degree of luck in the game but it's balanced well and adds to the fun of the story because a dramatic turn of fortune is always possible. There have been some memorable battles in this game that we still talk about years later. What are the cons? There is a bit of a learning curve but the effort is worth it. Storing the game is a pain: the components, once punched and sorted, simply don't fit back into the original boxes, which is nettlesome. It's necessary to buy additional storage containers. Setup is a chore.

----------

So, in my first game of DoA2, I saw Spartacus riding across a frozen mesa on a war horse to shiv an alien with a combat knife.  I then witnessed William Wallace slaying a golden boy diplomat from the future with a battle axe while riding a bicycle.  The scenario ended as Sgt. Grit, a resourceful and opportunistic war hero, recovered a sabre from a fallen foe and skewered an elusive femme fatale.  

Even though this was my introductory game, I could see the beauty of this amazing piece of work. This is the first game that has immediately jumped to a 10 for me, although, in full disclosure, I never researched a game as thoroughly as I did DoA2 before purchasing.

I love the story arcs that develop over the course of play; A spear-chucking QB eliminates a bazooka-toting Annie Oakley?  I can't stop smiling.  Quirky, hilarious, and downright fun.  Provides a nice logistical brain burn too as you try to optimize your loot/characters/positions.  Not to mention, the game is endlessly variable and expandable (I love game systems that are easily augmented).  Amazingly fun - exactly what a board game should be.

This is my #1 game.

Duel of Ages II borrows from a ton of different games, but it's like nothing else out there. Strategically the game rewards a strong setup, giving each team a cast of characters who must be able to dovetail in their abilities at least a little. Tactically it functions as a very light wargame, complete with line-of-sight rules, opportunity fire, and a potentially sprawling hexmap. The experience can be easily misinterpreted as either a goofy fragfest, or an unfocused chaotic trainwreck. But don't you believe it, because Duel of Ages II is a polished tactical masterpiece. It generates tons of narrative detail for those who are willing to put in the time, and it is an absurdly generous experience, brimming with characters, items, and funny situations. It requires effort to make it work, but it is worth the trouble.

A tactical game that is not a mainly combat one, cause there are missions and tasks that the players can perform in order to achive most of the victory points.

RATING: 8
After reading the rulebook, I got the dreadful feeling that this game was going to suck, being a mess of rules and statistics with little payoff, but after 5 plays or so the complexity : payoff ratio seems like a [i]bargain[/i]

So yes, it is fiddly, and the setting is a bit crazy and non-cohesive (think Marvel VS Capcom) -- but by having its own unique and relatable flavor and style, its easy to imagine the happenings in a lucid way that is quite endearing.

But despite its goofy exterior, this game ends fairly complex on the front-end. So there's a barrier to entry here. Definitely not a game for anyone. And that's not just limited to non-gamers either. I'd actually be cautious to recommend it or even suggest playing it to just any gamer without knowing his tastes -- but to the right person, this game is just a one of a kind experience!

Adding Master Set really blew my mind. The amount of components is downright disturbing. But in a good way. With say a FFG release,  you can cram a base game and two expansions into a normal sized box -- this one, after punching, the components barely fit into their respective boxes, are extremley heavy, and took me 90 minutes to sort. And finding the characters you need before a match is a logistics nightmare.

But it is justified. The items and characters do not suffer from "pseudo-variety", but nope, this game seems like the real deal. The characters especially are diverse, interesting, and well thought out.

Not since Cosmic Encounter have I seen a game system with this much focused content, and the character deck here makes Cosmic Encounter's stack of aliens and flares look like a Reiner Knizia design...

So do I love it? is it a 10? I liked this game from the getgo, but it smacked me with love while I was putting away my first mission of Triad. I realized I felt [i]SAD[/i]... not because I didn't want to stop playing, because it was long and grueling, and I was satisfied. But because I realized I would MISS the game world that we had created together; I had remembered the way to my base and to my opponent's. I knew the terrain like the back of my hand. I had worked to get the right weapons into the hands of the right people, and I had travelled back and forth through the labyrinths and fought in so many battles and experienced so many highs and lows that my head was spinning.

Any game that makes me feel like I'm going to miss a particular play, and make me sad that I'll never face that same map configuration and become acquainted with the same team members again (due to the limitless variety), probably deserves to be a 10. But for now I'll hold off since I don't actively want to play it all that much; kind of not very playable in some ways

Icing on the cake is that I expect this will work very well more-than-2 player in teams, because managing a team of 8 characters is actually so much overhead that having a teammate to help you keep track of stuff and strategize with is actually useful, despite the configuration being that of a 2 player game

This is a game that was created for me.  Content galore, I bought the "Master Set" for this game which includes 192 characters, 400 treasures, 32 platters, and much much more.  That's an awful lot of variety and after one play I could tell that all the characters and treasures and such actually feel different too so the game feels new each time.

This game reminds me a lot of Cosmic Encounter.  The mechanics themselves are reasonably simple (though not as simple as Cosmic).  It is a simple war game played with dice rolls (or the challenge deck which just dilutes the dice-roll matrix into a deck of cards).  I'm not sure how I feel about the deck of cards.  On one hand it speeds up game play because you don't have to do math, each player just draws a card from the deck.  On the other hand the 100 card deck is a 1-for-1 matrix of possible dice rolls to results so every result happens a maximum of once, I dislike the chaotic nature of the dice that this removes.  Plus I like rolling dice.

There are also some really nice RPG elements like opportunity attacks, line of sight, ability scores, etc.  Very much so the kind of game that's perfect for my personal tastes so I'm glad I took the plunge and bought the cow.

It isn't without its faults though.  This is definitely a game I feel should be played with more than two.  Even though every game is a duel between 2 teams, with just two players each player has 6+ characters to manage on their turn.  This can be overwhelming and a lot can be forgotten and missed this way making it hard to develop a cohesive strategy and also slows the game down quite a bit while you try to put something, anything, together.  With teams you can divide the character management and also have two heads working together on your strategy.

Also, the scenarios that come with the game are simple in nature.  Each game is essentially played the same way, sometimes with special "adventure keys" providing some variety, and the win is determined by achievements which are awarded based on how well you did certain things like attack the enemy, sabotage their base, escape the map, etc.  Even with all the variety in the content, without some more interesting ways to actually use that content I can see the game actually growing stale despite it.

This game is a ton of fun to play, and at 13 plays, I am only just starting to scratch the surface of what this games offers!  The basic premise of the game with the characters from various time periods clashing is awesome in and of itself, but the rules offer so many ways to play it, that it is mind boggling!  Look forward to getting this game to the table again soon!

:thumbsup: Characters, all 192 of them with the Master Set, are amazing. Each has 16 ratings in different skills/attributes, unique and thematic special abilities and icons, a gorgeous oversize character card, and a short story on the back of the card. Those stories are actually very good and really help immerse into the game and understand your characters! Each character has their own personality and feel very different during the game.
:thumbsup: I love drafting a team of characters and drafting terrain tiles to build a custom playing field that emphasizes the strengths of my team.
:thumbsup: A deck of challenge cards is so much better than dice. It's basically a deck of 100 cards containing a balanced distribution of random outcomes for every possible check ranging from complete failures to amazing successes. It's compact, elegant, faster than rolling dice, less fiddly, less prone to luck swings, and it's just as dramatic, even more. I love it. That's another reason to have Master Set – it has the second challenge deck so each team can have their own.

:thumbsdown: Overall, the pacing of the game is on the slower side. Your characters may enter on the other side of the map far away from all the action, and it may take some of them a long time to get anywhere so they can do something useful. After which they can be unlucky enough to get dismissed/banished to the other side of the map again.

What the first edition lacked in production quality, this one brings on the tabel. And my first 10 points for that. I gotta be honest... the game actually lacks a bit from tactics wise, but it just works for me in terms of theme and how the game flows. I wish there was more tactics but I know what this would bring about - more fiddling with counter or cards or whatever. Earth Reborn is a perfect example in this regards. We just cant put everything in one game. I like both styles, but with DoA I realise that at the end of the day I prefer fluidity over tactics.

Although what I got in the math trade for it,  probably will not be happy with the quality of the game I get in return.  Got Monsters Menace American in return for it,  not an equal value trade but DoA was not getting played.  If I don't like MMA I can always trade it away as well.

After enough plays I can definetly say: this game is too random, too fiddly and the story it tells is not deep or interesting - or even fun - enough. Has to go. The idea is still fun, but for that, I can play Heroscape.

Fantastic game. The card combos are what makes this (characters and items and the rest). The challenge deck is a well implemented design decision. A little bit longer than I would like, although that definitely makes for epic game sessions but makes it slightly difficult to hit the table. Want to play this for years to come.

Great mechanics, lots of flavor, memorable moments and tons of versatility round this out into a fantastic game. You can apply the mechanics in unique ways and use the tokens to create your own gameplay variants; capture the flag, king of the hill, deathmatch, or whatever else you could think of. There's a big community of people writing up custom character cards online too.

This game is a more sophisticated version of Heroscape. There is so much content and the combat is fun! Make sure you get the master set.

I love the theme of this game. I do not love the gameplay. There's just something unappealing about constantly "failing" challenges to me, even when I win.

I'm not giving up on it yet, though!

Fun Ameritrash game. Nothing really compares to it that I've ever played. It's like tactical war game meets RPG. It can be frustrating with the randomness at times. I do enjoy the diceless attacking. Tries to give an open world feel though other games do that better. The theme is great and most of the art and components are fantastic. Solid fun but not a game for everyone.

This is a much more streamlined version of the original Duel of Ages. It has gone diceless and while that was probably done to even out the probability curve, it also is a much more intuitive process when it comes to figuring out the results of attempted actions. The entire game has been overhauled to be more intuitive, including the victory conditions. I had previously commented on the original Duel of Ages that I wish it would be remade, but better...well, it has been.

While everything has been streamlined and improved, the game still seems a bit overwhelming. There are loads of characters, tons of weapons and half a dozen goals to pursue. In fact, when the game starts you will find yourself with eight different characters, each with fairly wordy special abilities and a wide range of stats to control, which seems like madness. In a sense, it is. But what you very quickly find out that this is a deadly game. Within a few turns, you will have lost two or three, while the guys that are left have probably leveled up and gathered enough weapons to become unstoppable questing/killing machines.

This is a neat arc, as the game naturally whittles your team down to the very best characters for whatever situation the board state is in for that particular session. After that, all of the tactical "wargame" type decisions can be made and then it gets quite thinky. The game is an absolutely ridiculous idea, both in its theme and in its scope. It doesn't take itself too seriously though and some of the adventure texts are down right hilarious.

So I got my wish. The designer revisited and rebooted his game....and it's incredible.

The game brings back the feeling of playing with a bunch of random action figures as a child.  No specific universe just a free-for-all of fun.

I just played this tonight and it was a horrible experience. I must be crazy. I appreciate thematic games. I love tactical games. I dig the theme. But the gameplay seems horrible to me. So far... I can't write it off just yet. My experience may be just an anomaly.

It took 45 minutes for me to get my first turn. In the 2 hours that it took to play the game I think I played for about 5 minutes.  The depth of play seemed trumped up and superficial.

This is currently my least favourite game I have ever played.

RATING: N/A
Crazy game. Ridiculous amount of materials and characters and pieces and items and hex terrain and treasure and encounters and tactics. Co-op or team vs team or free for all. Sci-fi, war heroes, sports jocks, fantasy heroes, and western fiction and real variable power characters all thrown together. Cool art. Need to reference the rule book a lot for all the modifiers for combat and movement which isn't a bad thing just so much to take in. Modern, future, and ancient challenge cards. Lots of mathy stuff on the card icons. If I was a teenager again or retired I'd love to delve into this game... but alas. Failure of Painful Proportions! You could spend a lifetime exploring this game and it wouldn't be a waste of time.

Basic set: more fun and more game than 99% of games.

Master set: puts the game over the top.

This game has it all, enough variety to develop a serious metagame, enough strategy to let the best man win, enough luck to keep the fool interested.  Strategy, tactics, adventure, combat, PvE, PvP, wars, subterfuge, etc.

This is everything I ever was looking for in board games and until something new shows up, this is undoubtedly the best board game I've ever played.

I was apprehensive about this game before purchasing. I then read the rules which started to get me excited about playing. I then played and had the most fun I have ever had playing a board game.

I have read people saying that the stories/memories of playing this were often a large part of the game and after just one game I agree wholeheartedly. 
Some of the random things that happen are just great fun to experience. I was particularly amused when my female character kissed my 13 year old sons male character causing him to switch sides to mine.
And I won't forget my son being on the floor in stitches after my weapon broke (there was a little story in the lead up to this that made the timing of the gun breaking so perfect and even more funny). 

A good imagination and want to role play are what's needed here to have one of the best gaming experiences there is to offer in my opinion. It's just a shame that it is out of print and difficult to get.

The game is just phenomenal.

+ Master Set.

Blown away by this game. Half wargame, half fantasy adventure. It truly does create great narrative and it feels like a labour of love.

So. Much. Stuff.
And yet it all seems balanced. Amaze!

Master set is completely essential for me.

This is a long game and it takes a while to set up but it's totally worth it. It has a truly unique feel, there's no other game quite like it. I have the Master Set which has an absolute bucket-load of stuff in it, it can slow the game down a bit but the options are mind-blowing.

My enthusiasm for the game has faded over time - I think the master set is great but with so many variables it can lead to non-starter combinations and really dry games. It can also be amazing. Since the game takes so long to play it can be like gambling with time when bringing this to the table.

Despite investing in the master set and only getting 10 games I'm considering this for trade to make space for newer games. I may have got what I wanted from this game and it is the epitome of clunky. The game needs streamlining in so many ways.

+ Master Set

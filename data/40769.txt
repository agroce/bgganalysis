100313 For some reason I find this very tense in an unenjoyable way -- and that's in spite of the fact I've won my first two games of it (using the get as many different colors tokens with the fewest equipment strategy both times).  I think its because you never really feel like you get a good efficient "engine" even though this game is all about efficient movement.

I really liked Valdora after one play. But now that I own Africana which shares the book mechanic, I don't feel the need to own it. It has some pretty bits and is nicely constructed with I think tight mechanics. Over all, fine enough, but nothing outstanding for me.

The rules seemed a little overbearing, but it was a ruse; it played swiftly and easily.  Almost no questions.

Maybe one of the very best pick-up-and-deliver games I have ever played.  Fun and brain-tickling.  Entertaining "catalog" mechanism.  A winner!

Pick up and deliver gems to meet contracts in the most efficient manner possible.  Thought required not just about that, but about the most efficient amount of time and gold to be spent assembling equipment to dig and carry gems.  The idea of leafing through books of contracts is quite neat.

As efficiency games with negligible player interaction go, this one was painless.  However, despite random set ups of gems, contracts and equipment, I suspect Valdora will start to feel samey quite quickly.

The Abacus production - particularly those big wooden books - and artwork are nicely done.

RATING: 7
1 of 2 Schacht titles in 2009 that didn't get broad international distribution until late.  This is a very solid game design that falls into the super-filler, family game category.  It can feel a bit fiddly with all the gems and the static board might lead one to think re-play is low, but both of these are overcome by the rest of the game's components and play.  At its core, it is a set collection game that is driven by a basic pick-up and deliver idea.  Because the scoring has several interactive options, experienced game play will focus on how scoring is progressing and less on the action immediately on the board.  Visually appealing and approachable.

A nice game with truly innovative components. Yes, the pick up and delivery has been done before, and in much greater ways than this seemingly light game, but the books mechanics is truly nice.

That said, it can be a bit too random for this kind of game. Usually, a pick up and delivery game is more deterministic, and there's a reason why: not knowing what you can get stops you from planning effectively, and that, in a game where planning is key, can get frustrating at times.

Fortunately, Valdora is a rather quick and light hearted game, so this seemingly huge drawback is just a minor quip.

Rating may vary in the future, but for now, it stands as a rather good game I'm willing to play more than occasionally.

Valdora is the lighter pick up and deliver game in my collection. The rules are simple, streamlined and polished: they aim at the essentials of the genre, with movement as free as possible (you can parse the map in two moves, or one if you have food!) and a clever "booklike" system to give players short term objectives. It is even possible to try to differentiate strategies, pursuing specialization or differentiation for bigger points. It is a pleasant lighter game, as usual for mr. Schacht.

A very light, somewhat repetitive game (reminded me of Stone Age in many ways). Seemed like the main way to score was to rush to a majority in something then cash in - it did not seem like there were many other paths. Certainly wouldn't turn down another game though.

Valdora...what a weird game. 
The board and components look fantastic, and I love the "turn the pages of the book" mechanic.

The weird part comes with the limitations; you can only carry one gem in your bag, and balance one on your pickaxe.

Anyway, it's a great pickup and deliver game, which I enjoy a lot. It's on the lighter side, so it might be used for people who are not avid gamers, even though my gamer-friends enjoy it as well.

RATING: 8
Lightning fast pace game!  Once player's have a little equipment and some commissions to their names they know exactly what they want to do and don't waste any time performing their action on their turn.  I wonder if the game would be a little more strategic if you could perform more than 1 action only in a turn?  It would make the race to the Workshops a little more interesting.  The game feels a little mechanical after a while. I still like it, but it is probably my least favorite Schacht title right now.

RATING: N/A
Pick up and deliver game - nothing outstanding here, and there are others in the genre that I'd much rather play.

Books of cards were cute - liked that element, where you turn pages (needs to be in a different game, say one about spell books!)

That was the positive, downsides were the bits that didn't work for me with the theme:

'Prices' of the equipment, why do you have to keep paying to use a cart and donkey (I know it's to balance the mechanic of a wild choice, but doesn't work for the theme for me)

Why can a backpack only hold a specific color of gem? Why doesn't what you carry slow you down, why can you move as far as you like on a road but have to stop in a city (or eat provisions). What are you doing to collect the stuff you pickup? What are you doing at the silver mine, mining the coins or stealing them? Why does it cost money to get a contract, could maybe understand this if it was an open auction.

And gameplay - mostly no interaction (you have to pay if someone is in the space (but not city) you want to use - and the interaction is mostly unintentional, rarely you'll go somewhere to stop someone, rather it was just chance. If this was a quick filler (say 45 minutes) I'd play it, took us over an hour and by half way through I was equally frustrated and bored (and I ended up winning which was unexpected).

This pickup & deliver (p&d) game was raped by a dull,soulless, uncreative theme. 
Interaction will only occur by accident.
The book mechansim is just bland, but through this it distinguish from other p&d games.  The twist is you can only pick-up gems for which you have the right bags (transport icon).
Also the game is fiddly and has a confusing board.

The better p&d game by Schacht is Hansa. None needs Valdora if you have Hansa.

RATING: 5.5
It's a beautiful-looking game, and I had high hopes for it during the rules explanation.  Ultimately, though, it was a fairly tepid pickup-and-deliver game with some odd artistic choices and a few conversation-provoking theme oddities.

Nit-picky gripes (you've been warned!):

The first stumbling block was the extremely fiddly set up.  Seriously, the stripe on the "book pages" (aka cards) has to be going the same way?  If it's such a big deal, why not make it a horizontal or vertical stripe instead of a diagonal stripe??  Also, the borders on the book pages used to distinguish the different piles were too similar.

Several gameplay elements didn't seem to mesh with the theme.  Why is the price for a backpack the same as that for a donkey, but then you have to pay each time you ask the donkey to carry anything?  And why can a donkey only carry the same amount as a backpack?  Are the donkeys unionized?  Why can a backpack only hold a specific color of gem?   Why are you allowed to sprint about the country side carrying up to six different backpacks at the same speed as someone carrying one?  Exactly what services are you offering to the silver miners that allow you to stroll into a mine and demand that they refill your pockets with money?  Why does it cost money to buy a delivery order or even turn a page in the delivery/equipment "book," yet it costs nothing to refill your provisions?  Are you dumpster diving?  Making rat jerky?  Stealing apples from the fruit cart?

Quite a fun, fast, pick-up and deliver game. Decisions are simple but there is a fun press-your-luck element in going for multiple contracts before other players take the gems/craftsmen you need. The two-player rules are a little disappointing, as the craftsmen and bonus tiles vanish much too fast and make it incredibly hard to gain workshops (and thus bonus tiles). Still, yet another fun Schacht game, light enough for non-gamers but challenging enough to keep my interest.

Africana is a better version of this, however, so I'd recommend getting that if you only want one.

A pretty cool pick-up and deliver game.  Players buy backpacks to carry gems around in, pick up gems, and buy contracts in order to turn those gems into points.  As with most pick-up and deliver games, a lot of the game is trying to be as efficient as possible to fulfill as many contracts as you can.  There's a little more to the game, but that's the gist of it.  Also, the book components are pretty cool!  Neat game.

This is a game of collecting resources and then completing comissions by delivering the resources to a specified location. In this it is not disimilar to a bunch of other games. Alas there is nothing particularly special mechanic wise to set it apart like say Traders of Genoa and in this sense its not a classic. That said the decisions are simple enough to occupy the minds of more experienced gamer and simple enough for the family or gateway market. It has its place but its no SDJ candidate in my opinion.

Remek játék, főleg családi játéknak - de nem alapjátéknak - kiváló. Ami tetszik benne:
- fantasztikus hangulat és tartozékok, gyönyörű külső
- 60 perc a játékidő 3-4-5 játékos esetén is
- gyors egymásután következünk, alig van holtidő, így élvezetes a játék
- bár ez a "szerezz valamit, hogy azzal szerezz valamit amivel talán győzelmi pontot szerezhetsz" mechanikára épül, még abszolút átlátható stílusban teszi mindezt
- sok út vezet a győzelem felé

Ami nem tetszik:
- szerencse a lapok felhúzásánál (hiába gyúrok rá adott színre, ha a többi ugyanolyan színű lap a pakli legalján van)
- a kártyák elkülönítése (főleg a szélső barna illetve szürke csík, bár ez igazán csak a lapok szétválogatásakor fontos)
- a játék hirtelen vége
- ha valaki az elején "leragad" és rossz taktikát követ, szinte lehetetlen felzárkózni, már 1-2 rosszul kigondolt akció miatt elbukható a játék
- legnagyobb hibájának ezt tartom: Nincs benne semmi újdonság mechanikát tekintve.
- hiányolom még a kereskedés lehetőségét játékosok között, vagy pl. olyan akciólehetőséget, amivel más játékosok megbízásait is megcsinálhatom (persze borsos árat fizetve a lap gazdájának), mert ugyan figyelni kell egymásra, ki mit tervez, hol van, hová készül, de egy kis kereskedéssel még meg lehetett volna bolondítani!

Egyébként 2 játék után azt mondom: tetszetős és ami igazán jó benne, hogy nagyon alaposan végiggondolt, nagyon jól működő játékról van szó, olyanról, amit JÓ játszani!

Valdora has been on my want-to-play list for a while now, mostly because it was a game that eluded play at Spiel for a few years running now. So I was happy to give it a go at last.

In hindsight, I could have saved me the trouble. Valdora is about efficiently traversing a graph which has been made inaccessible on purpose for game balance purposes. Game balance also requires you to make tons of stopovers which do nothing but artificially increase the game time so that various strategic approaches have an equal chance of flourishing. The result is a very 'gamey' game devoid of any interesting questions and problems. But that is not even the worst part about Valdora. No, that is reserved for the fact that graph traversal has been executed far better in a good deal of designs... most notably the ageing Hansa, which, adding insult to injury, was designed by the same author. Hansa is full of little joyous whirls and whorls which at times have you sacrificing a position you built up in order to gain an advantage elsewhere, and fitting that in with setting up your opponents in impossible positions which cause them to lose [i]sente[/i]. All those things are missing from the later Valdora... with, perhaps, the exception of the skill wheel. But the dreadful monotony of the rest of the game smothers whatever spark of design genius lurks here. 

Really, avoid. I'm being merciful with my rate because I like the artwork and the plastic gems.

The best game of 2009. The rules are simple but there are meaningful choices to be made, the turns are quick and the game doesn't drag on for too long, scoring is usually tight and there is just enough randomness in the setup to affect the strategies and keep the players interested from game to game. And the components are absolutely gorgeous.

Nagyon jó kis családi játék. Nem túl bonyolult szabályok, a szerencse szerepe benne van, hiszen akinek sikerül fehér megbízást megkaparintania, az előnybe kerül. Szegény feleségem kétszer is sikeresen kikaparta a gesztenyét a nagymamának a megbízás könyv lapozgatásával. Egyébként a játékban különböző színű céhek megbízásait próbáljuk teljesíteni minél hatékonyabban, ehhez felszereléseket vásárolunk és drágaköveket gyűjtögetünk. Érdemes minél több színű mesterembert begyűjteni, mert a végén szép "pénzt", vagyis pontot érnek. Ha már ismerjük a játékot, 1 óra alatt simán lemegy. Nekünk szabálymagyarázattal, nagymamával, majd játék közbeni szabálymagyarázattal a nagymamának :) is lement 2 óra alatt az első játékunk. Nem mehetünk el a játék grafikája mellett sem, hiszen öröm ránézni a táblára,olyan szemet gyönyörködtetően színes. (2014.12.06.)

Még csak 1 játékhoz volt szerencsém, de elsőre is tetszett. Valahol a kicsit több mint családi kategória. És hát persze az egyik kedvenc szerzőm. Gyönyörű kivitelezés, jó játék menet, azért némi szerencse, h milyen kártyát tudsz megszerezni-igaz az első kört nem teljesen jól játszottunk, így fordulhatott elő, h valakinek sikerült három 15 pontos lapot is beszereznie, és ezzel -mivel sikerült teljesítenie is őket, gyakorlatilag eldőlt a játék.Ezért éreztem úgy h a szerencse erős benne, de ha a jó szabállyal játsszuk, akkor csak 2-t bír megszerezni..és úgy már kiegyensúlyozottabb lett volna. Szóval kéne még 1 játék vele, h lássam mennyire szerencse a szerencse. DE ennek ellenére tetszett, tervezés-tervezés, operációkutatás, optimalizálás.
Még egy játék, most már a sajáttal. Tetszik. És most már azt kell mondjam, ha  szerencse azért -kártya vásárlás ide vagy oda- nem erős benne. Családoknak is ajánlott, ugyanakkor gémereknek is.
Update2:
kiegekkel játszva még jobb. Olyan plusz lehetőségeket adnak, amik még tervezhetőbbé, izgalmasabbá teszik a játékot.
Update 3: azért a 3 db 15-ös egy kézben összejövetele biztos nyerő kombónak tűnik, azaz ez szerencse. Ugyanakkor a kiegekkel elérhető, h ne legyen még se biztos győztes stratégia. Csak alapjátékot használva nem lehet kivédeni -valószínű-.

I'll sit at the table if someone brings it out, but Valdora didn't rub me positively or negatively.  It just felt... standard, I guess.  Which, I suppose, was the design goal of the game, so in that respect, it is quite successful.  However, for an entry-level game, I can think of several others I would rather play that are still fun without being any more complex or heavier than Valdora.

Pretty game, light hearted and fun. Picking up gems and selling them on a contract. It reminds me of die goldene stadt. You need to watch out for the Vp at the end of the game, the variety gives you more victory points which I did not know until the game ended.

For a comparison with another Michael Schacht pickup-and-deliver game: [thread=804878][/thread]


The bottom line: "Right from the moment you open the box, it's obvious that Valdora has an immediate aesthetic appeal. Fortunately the game-play lives up to the high expectations created by the attractive components. It's not for those who want their games to be free of any luck, or want the interaction with their opponents to be more direct or vicious. But as far as euros go, Valdora is a very solid family game that makes excellent use of the pickup and deliver mechanic, and offers easy-to-learn gameplay while still ensuring that players have to make decisions that matter. Those who enjoy the challenge of logistics and optimization will especially take to the puzzle-like challenge that Valdora offers. The page-turning book of orders is something fresh and creates additional interest."

Too complicated for a family game but the design and pieces are just great. It's simply a pleasure to take a look at the board or touch the wooden books. Nevertheless don't get fooled by it - the game is VERY abstract and dry.

Beautiful game.  Plenty of different strategies to follow, engaging,turns come round quickly and you need to be keeping an eye on all sorts of things in between.  Keen to play again.

I love pick-up-and-deliver, but have only gotten this to the table once.  Need to correct that, as I remember really enjoying the first game.  I kinda wish the gold gems were metallic instead of translucent yellow.  I'm tempted to paint them, but then they would likely be tactilely discernible.

I haven’t had much experience with pick-up and delivery games, so this is a pleasant experience. You have to carefully consider what the most efficient way to do things. Completing several contracts in a row is one thing you could do, but not always easily obtained. The silver contracts are the easy one to fulfill, but at the same time you do not get as much reward. The jewelry contracts are hard to set up, but when you manage to do it, they are pretty lucrative. 

I would think that this would be an excellent introduction for new players. I have played it with 3 and 4 players and it have played equally good. When people know the game it plays very fast.

An interesting Transportation game, with route/action optimisation and some elements of set collection. There are a number of different ways to score points (Commissions, Craftsmen, Workshops), so it comes down to whether the strategy you chose can be made more lucrative than your opponents.

My first (3 player) game was interesting but kinda blah... and subsequently I had a lot of inertia towards playing it again (inertia which grew the longer I left it)... eventually took the plunge again just recently, basically having to re-learn the game from the rules, and it really intrigued me a lot more (this time with 4 players).

Am definitely looking forward to getting in another game of this.. so I can try new strategies.

You get a reasonable sense of what the game is like by calling it Hansa-heavy, though of course it is actually still pretty light.  As for me, I love pick-up-and-deliver games with a slightly irrational love, and I'm also a big fan of Michael Schacht for games like China and Hansa, so I was eager to try this one.  It really does create a pick-up-and-deliver experience in about 60 minutes, including such essential ingredients as a rather inconvenient map and a need to realize what time it is.  I really like the way that you can choose your contracts by flipping through the book--it's functionally interesting, not just cute. The way the cities function as roadblocks works to create an interesting map on a small board.  Good stuff.  (2 plays)

Michael Schacht does pick up and move?  Sadly, it is not his strong suit.  The little book gimmick is visually cute, but the themeatics are BLAAAAAANNNNDDD -- can't we pick up something, anything, other than gems?  Outside of the book, there is not a ton of novelty here and it relies on a radomization process -- variable contract values determined by card decks -- that tend to undo all pick up and move games.

seems relatively balanced, 3 player game was really close (160, 157, 148).  moves are quick so little down time.  Can't wait to play with more players with more competition for the gems on the road, for the workshops, and more encounters (some one is where you want to be so need to pay them a coin).

2nd play was with more players.  as expected the gems on the road went a lot quicker.  Also timing was important (though I think I would have won anyway) at game end... two of us had 15 pt contracts, I also had the white workshop... I complete the contract before the other player could for 15, plus a 10 bonus, and triggering game end and he wasn't able to complete his on his last go.  that's a possible 40 pt swing if he completed it 1st.

I was shocked that Schacht had created such a mundane procedural game with so many shiny elements.  In a pick up and deliver game, you want there to be some opportunity for creative pathing and strategy.  It seemed to start out that way, as players invest in larger holding capabilities.  However, so much slows you down.  It quickly became tedious.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
We both really enjoy this game, for a few reasons.

First of all, the most obvious, is the components - the gems are a treat, the artwork is great, but the wooden book holders really stand out and make this game really look sharp.

Secondly, it has a deceptive amount of strategy involved. You will need to, and will score better if you do, keep your mind a few steps ahead of your turn. Whether it's pushing hard to get the workshop, or stealing commissions just so your opponent(s) can't get their own bonus points, there's some interesting decisions to be made. What's more, you're not locked in to any strategy, and are able to completely change direction in the middle of the game and still have a chance at winning. Furthermore, it's nice to have a game where there's not a 'preferred' route to victory that everyone races for; we can all take our own tract to get there.

Which brings up the last point - it's that the scoring of the game is variable and, oftentimes, unpredictable. Our first game scored 136 - 137 - 138; and the person who won hadn't taken a single workshop or bonus chip. Our second game had a wider gamut of scores, but everyone was surprised that the obvious frontrunner based on bonus chips and completed commissions was not the person who won.

RATING: 7
I like games with short moves and I like logistics games. So this one should do it for me and it did. At least on first play. There is a possibility that this will fade with further play as moves could get repetitive and the big commissions might prove to be too decisive reducing the potential strategies. Still, a nice family game.

I love the components, the artwork, the overall quality of its presentation.
I love the fact that turns go FAST, very fast.  There is little downtime.  There are some choices, although this is where the game loses a couple of points.
I am a tad concerned that over the corses of many plays, the gameplay will become repetative.  Pick up more tools, pick up contracts, deliver them.  Not enough decisions to remain strong for the long haul.
Still, I'll always play (for now).
With a price reduction, I'd even pick this up.

Some blocking elements might make this game a bit better I think. Goldene Stadt is a way better.

First of all a warning to all the games groups I belong to, you will be hearing about one of my moves playing Valdora for a long time.  I still lost but I was so pleased with my move that I might even get a t-shirt commemorating the moment.

Why is this important to a comment on the game? Well the execution of the move meant I understood where I was in the context of the game, the tools I had available and how I could use them, a high level of engagement with the game, a clear idea of strategy but knowledge of tactics so how to respond to threats.  Finally, a concern that the move (which was over 5 individual stages) wouldn't work because of other players actions which meant not only was there a real challenge within the game but also a level of interaction (maybe not enough for many but certainly enough for me).   So doing a clever move, you have to understand which is very rare for me, symbolises to me a game which is not only accesible but is elegantly designed and draws players in.  Add to this the speed of the game, the beautiful production and the variety of strategies that were available this game is another sure fire winner for Mr Schacht.  Another prize winner . . . well I would'nt bet against it.

I will say this; the more players the more chaos. I saw another play with 3 that was much closer and much more strategic.

It's what I was expecting from this game, and had feared with 5 players. I'm thinking this one caps out with 4.

An instant hit with the kids. Even the 5-yo grasped it immediately. I expected there to be one rule too many for him. I´m curious how this will play with adults. I can see it being functional, beautiful and forgetable. Time will tell. Anyway, I bought it as a next-step game for the kids, and it seems to fit the bill very well. I rate it a 7 and I´m very happy with this purchase.

Approx 60 mins as a 2-player with the boy.

07/27/10 Played a five-player game. I found Valdora a pleasant game. But not one I'd care to play often. The wacky theme is off-putting to me. Although the artwork and production values are high. As Tom Vasel suggested in his video review, Valdora is aimed more towards those that are new to the hobby and therefore more impressed by the "shiny". Its vanilla ice cream. Nice if you've never eaten ice cream. But those with a sophisticated palate usually want more flavor in their games.

In the valley of Gold, each player has a pawn which moves around a board with four cities. In between the cities are stops, seeded randomly with 6 gems . Also on the board are silver mines, which allow one to refresh up to 6 silver pieces. Two of the cities have resources (donkeys, carts, pickaxes, etc to pick up the gems). The resources cost a gold (a yellow gem). The other two cities have the orders, which show a color gem, and where it gets delivered to. You get rewarded for delivering gems, but also for diversity (10 pts for each different kind of gem) and volume.

It's a decent game, the mechanics are simple and the components are very nice. I only played this once; going third out of 4 people, I could not get a craftsman at the end when I delivered a gem, so I hope turn order doesn't affect this game. But that's only a minor quibble, and I look forward to more plays.

This is a fairly standard, run-of-the-mill pick-up-and-deliver game with a few neat features, such as the wooden books and the circular board that distributes the workers. I'm not sure there's a lot of skill to be applied, but I would be glad to play again to find out. It's a pretty game and I enjoyed the experience but I'm pretty sure that I would grow weary of it quickly.

RATING: 4.5
Like a lot of Michael Schacht games, this offers a simple framework of rules for emergent strategy. But unlike nearly all other Schachts, I found it somewhat lacking in urgency and tenseness. With less than 5P, there are too many options and too little player interaction (particularly in the nasty negative sense!) to really add up, and even with the maximum player count it's not a particularly strong interaction. The game's strongest asset - the book-flipping mechanism - is somewhat weakened by the cards being identical on both sides.

Cute game with some very easy rules.  Once everyone understood the mechanics turns were a matter of seconds.

A pick up and deliver game that solves a few of the genre's problems. Most money is replaced with most VPs and it introduces a strategic element on how to acquire VPs - specialisation in one colour vs generalisation over many colours, together with simple vs complex deliveries. Instead of just picking the best contracts, you're faced with decisions on whether to pursue your strategy when the board isn't helping or sacrifice it for easier but short term gains. It also solves the "long haul" issue - when most money requires multiple turns doing nothing but moving from one end of the map to the other. Here, the map is navigable in two turns, allowing the focus to remain on the core delivery and VP acquisition aspects. On the downside, the map feels too constrained for massive replay and it’s pretty themeless - faceless gems to nameless places - which reduces delivery satisfaction. On the plus side, the game is fast running, all done in 60 minutes or less, provides some tension along the way in the colour races, and overall provides a pleasant experience

Based on one play: This is a standard pick up and deliver game. Go to one location and for a gold gem you can get space to carry more gems and then, after collecting gems, you can get missions for a gold coin in order to get points by delivering specific colored gems to different locations. It is quite boring and there is almost no thought, just go where you can on your turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a beautiful game in which you pick up gems to either buy the ability to pick up more gems, or tiles that give you points.  However, the gems run out as people pick them up, so while buying the former do help you collect more efficiently, it can be a waste if there aren't gems left.  Of course, the scoring tiles encourage you to specialize and diversify at the same time, giving you lots of interesting decisions.  It's not too complicated, but has a good amount of depth.

Pros: Successfully evokes the mood of traveling around the countryside, picking up and delivering gems.  Most turns are very, very quick.  Only real slowdown is when someone is flipping through a book, but when someone else is looking through the book, you're engaged too, because you want to see what things are in the book and where, and try to remember the location in the deck of the items that are important to your own strategy.

Cons: Not a whole lot of interaction.  Game always unfolds in a similar way, so it's not clear how much replay value it has.  Lots of little ways the theme and mechanisms don't quite mesh (why can a ruby only go in a ruby-designated bag, for example).

This game is so spectacularly mediocre.

It has the worst kind of player interaction, the kind where players get in your way not because they want to block you but because they just happened to need what you needed.

Just like a worker placement game.

So you think you've got your turn planned out, but your opponent is where you wanted to go. So you have to rethink your move, which adds additional downtime to a game so light.

Mechanisms: It's basic pick-up-and-deliver. There are gems all over the board of various colours that you have to pick up and deliver to corresponding palaces. The number of gems you may carry is limited to the number and kind of bag cards you are carrying (which cost one gold, a yellow gem, each). To be able to make a delivery, you must purchase contract cards for one silver coin each.

What makes this game unbearably irritating:

1. The luck factor. You either may purchase the fist available bag/contract, or pay extra to go through the deck, one silver coin for each card you want to peek at. This, of course, dramatically reduces strategic scope since you can't plan for a bag/contract to be there when you need it.

2. Stupid, artificial, Euro-esque scoring. You score if you deliver a lot of one type of gem, and you also score if you deliver a large variety of gems. You are rewarded for delivering goods with points, not with silver coins, so there isn't really an economic system here. You want money, you simply go to the mine.

3. Really, really fiddly and unthematic mechanisms to keep track of how many gems of each colour you've delivered.

4. The worst part of the game: If you end your move at a spot where your opponent is, you must pay one silver coin. Because this game artificially makes resources tight (you may only have six coins at any time), opponents usually end up accidentally blocking you, which forces you to rethink your move,

Perhaps this game is meant for families. The game itself is so devoid of excitement and any appealing theme -- I don't think kids would care for this one at all.

Grat game to play with a group that is not into direct confrontation. It's easy enough to make at least a few of your plans succeed. I suspect as we play it more the possibilities for "screwage" will present themselves, but you can do fine just concentrating on your own stuff. Personally, I prefer more confrontation (Steam Barons!), but this game is good enough to keep me interested in planning my gem-craftsman-workshop-bonus deliveries. My wife is quite taken with this game and she somewhat dislikes Endeavor--still trying to figure her out :) (I think it has to do with Endeavor being more confrontational and having all its scoring done at the end.)

I'm not a big fan of pickup-and-deliver games, and there isn't much here other than that.  The game functioned just fine, but it was very repetitive between turn,s between games, and between players.  It just didn't offer much opportunity for strategic diversification, nor is there an exciting escalating arc.  Along the way, there is a bit of luck and a bit of memory, neither of which is huge but both of which are frustrating and undermine the strategy.

I'm pretty sure the dominant strategy is
(1) get a cart to hold gold
(2) fulfill 15 pt mission when able
(3) focus on diversity when not able
This strategy benefits from the most efficient point engines and it is very robust against luck/memory when collecting commissions.

The only other strategies appear to be:
(a) focus on gold & silver.  This promises easy but low points with overflow bonuses.  However, it is is a little inefficient and suffers a lot from bad luck when turning pages.  The efficiency of many low point gains doesn't pair will with luck in getting the missions you need.  It relies on tempo efficiency, which it cannot guarantee.

(b) focus on a quick rush for diversity.  This approach doesn't really work since there is not really that much shortage: being the first to get a color is not much of an advantage; the key is to not be last.  So the rushing player screws someone at random, but doesn't help themselves.

Even if I am wrong about this assessment, all three strategies basically play the same as each other, and the same on every turn of the game, so they are all BORING.

It's a nice and simple game. There's no complicated rules to get your head around. It's about logistics, efficiency and timing. This is a nicely balanced game. The winner should be the player who's seen opportunities others haven't, timed their end run to perfection, implemented a good strategy that doesn't conflict with the other players if possible. If you don't play many games this is a solid choice to play and buy. For the seasoned gamer though it offers very little new and is rather uninspiring. Turns are quick and you could play and chat at the same time without it interfering with your concentration. I'd say it's probably a good family game. There's no theme to speak of and it's not something I'd play over and over.

RATING: 8
A játék nagyon szép és nagyon jó. Minden játékosnak a körében csak egy mozgásra és akcióra van lehetősége, ezért 5-en sem volt sok holtidő mire újra sorra került az ember. A dobozon található 60 perc jó 90-nek is, legalábbis ennyi játékosszámnál. A könyv része a játéknak nagyon jól működött, mindenki dicsérte. Simán lemaradtam pontszámban a többiektől, de a semmit nem vont le a játékélményből, végig élveztem az egészet. Az sem mondható el, hogy nagyon ki tudnak szúrni veled az ellenfelek, a helyezésedért tényleg csak magadat tudod okolni. Egyre jobban szeretem Schacht játékait, mert lehet játszani kezdőkkel és komoly játékosokkal is, minden játékának vannak mélységei, mellette meg roppant egyszerűek is egyben.
Update1: Első alkalommal egy szabályt nem jól játszottunk, de úgy is jó volt :)

A "questing game" simplified to bare bones, but it is still interesting. The books, ultra-simple rules, beautiful components and ease of scoring make the game. Need a couple more plays to ascertain the strategic value; seems very tactical right now, with some memory needed.

RATING: 6
Ah, Valdora – the land where gems are strewn all over dirt paths, yet remain in high demand by important houses and tossed into a field once done with. Players gallivant around the board to pick up said gems, contracts and some suspiciously specialised equipment.

As usual with most Schacht designs, Valdora is a pleasant, family-friendly experience despite being rather ordinary and repetitive. Flipping through the books for equipment and contracts may be fun at first, but that tends to fade into the background as the game progresses. Also, the various limitations on movement and held items makes the tempo a little too janky for my liking. At any rate though, it’s still miles better than the tepid trilogy member [thing=84869][/thing].

This is an interesting pick-up-and-deliver game, with one particular neat mechanic (the books of equipment & commissions) but I felt like it outstayed its welcome, and that I was running by rote by the end of the game.

Ilyen egy tökéletes családi játék. Talán ez a legjellemzőbb mondat a Valdorára. Könnyed, gyors és nagyon szép játék. Felszerelésekkel szerelkezünk fel, hogy Valdora tájait bejárva drágaköveket gyűjthessünk. Küldetéseket vásárolunk és a drágaköveket a megfelelő helyre szállítjuk le, amiért győzelmi pontokat kapunk. A szabály nagyon egyszerű, a játék lemegy egy, max. másfél óra alatt. Minden játékosszámnál szerintem jól működhet. Kellemes kis játék, de én úgy gondolom azért komoly gémerek nem igazán díjaznák.

[2012-06-09]
Nos mindenképp rontok a pontszámon, mert már az első játék alkalmával is kijött, hogy van erős stratégia a játékban, ez a második alkalommal is nyert, szerencsére nem nagyon fölényesen, de nagyon úgy tűnik teljesen egyértelműen a 3-as küldetésekre kell menni. Olyan ez, mint az Egiziában a Szfinxkártyák. Ha ezzel mindenki tisztában van, akkor semmit nem ront a játékélményen.

RATING: 6.5
This is a set-collection pick-up-and-deliver game. Cool bits (wooden books with cards that look like pages of a book, which you flip as expected; plastic gems). The board has 5 cities in corners, and one in the middle. 2 outer cities give you orders for items, the other 2 give you tools to help carry items; the items themselves are at various stops along the paths. So you pick up stuff, going from location to location as efficiently as possible (cities also limit your movement). Not a lot new here, but it works well and plays quickly. Not bad.

I'm still deciding about this one so this is a preliminary rating. It's a solid design as per usual and it works very well. All the mechanics are very well balanced. Plain and simple like other Schacht's designs.
I have to play it again in order to decide better how to rate it. 

I think this is one of those games that gets better if played with more players. I like the short individual turns.

After a few more plays I now think that Valdora is a very well designed game with now flaws and a high ammount of replayability. It's not a brilliant game but it works as a whole which is something very difficult to achieve.

This new offering from Michael Schacht is not bad at all. Up front, it's just a simple pick-up-and-deliver game, but it has some interesting twists which make it work. The theme is, of course, a bit clunky, but it does the job.

Quintessential Euro. Good pick-up and deliver game, easy to get into. Resource plentiful and can be repetitious. Book mechanism is neat, but not a big deal (it's novelty may not impress as much these days, though at the time it bowled everyone over). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
At first it seems a little scripted (get all your equipment) with little tension (blocking is limited to paying for sharing spots) and repetitive play (pick and delivery).

I didn't get into the game until midgame where the Schacht touch revealed itself. You realize then that every action from the beginning mattered and the winner is the better optimizer.

Not my favorite Schacht I would buy or play repetitively, but a nice discovery nonetheless.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Finely tuned game which I would put in the top tier of Michael Schacht's designs.  Granting that it is a pick-up-and-deliver game, it manages to feel bigger and more interesting than a typical game in that genre.  The two currencies (gold and silver) help, as does the clever "page turning" gimmick for when you pick out carrying equipment or contracts.  Valdora seems to me to have the potential to become very popular.

After 3 or 4 plays I am still coming in last place with this one yet I am still finding the game very enjoyable as try to figure out how to make efficient moves and find a strategy that will maximize my points.

Absolutely is what it says - a Pick Up & Deliver game. Very well executed and decisions to make on short-term/long-term benefits of actions. Nice components and some original mechanics make this a very enjoyable game.

RATING: 6
There's some really interesting things going on in Valdora, and the bits are beautiful. However, players who have good luck getting the contracts they need without expending a lot of money hunting through the pile will certainly be at a big advantage. I've also seen several games where the runaway winner simply delivered silver/money contracts, which are far easier than the gem contracts. If left unchecked by other players, I think a silver-delivery strategy will win every time, which is a little disappointing. Overll, I like pretty much every aspect of Valdora - components, gameplay and theme - but not enough to want to own the game.

Played once with 5 players. This was a very pleasant surprise. I thought it would be good, but not as good as it is. There is hardly any down time between turns, even with 5 players since each player does micro moves and there aren't too many different options each go. While this is a pick up and deliver game, it is almost entirely about optimization of moves. Very clever mechanism with the book. Highly recommended for families, light gamers and even medium gamers.

Valdora is a very shiny pick-up and deliver game with a fair number of tasks layered in.  The theme is incompletely executed with more of an eye towards package photography than enriched gameplay.  The endgame quickly descends into rote task-completion.

Standard pick up and deliver game, but the "books" are the heart of what makes it interesting.  They control what tools and contracts you can purchase by flipping the cards like they're book pages.  Fun, but I can see where it may not hold up to repeated plays over a short period of time.

RATING: 7
Rating based on a single two player game, using the Valdora Extra expansion. This is one gorgeous looking game: The artwork is great, the tokens and pawns are good quality and the idea of the books is awesome. Because of this, it is a pity that the colours of some of the gems and some of the tiles are a bit hard to distinguish between - especially for color blind players like me. Gameplay is solid: It holds very few suprises, but all elements work well together and the optimization engine is finely tuned (it was designed by Mr Schacht after all). There is some turn angst with regard to obtaining majorities, and the game sometimes rewards a gamble. Rules are easy to explain, turns can be player really quickly, and players will feel they are in the race until the very end. Rating may well rise with more plays.
UPDATE: It plays much, much better with four than it does with two (using the Extra expansion)!

While learning this game, I made the comment that what I liked about Michael Schacht games is that they seem very, very simple on the surface, but reveal layers of depth in the choices you make the more you play them.  There's something very intriguing about his games to me, and a pick-up-and-deliver mechanism tied in with a book mechanism were all it took to get me interested in this latest game from the designer.  The movement mechanism reminded me of that in Hansa, though there was no "don't give the best move to your next opponent" mechanism in place.  It's a gorgeous, bright game with interesting choices and some clever mechanisms, and it's a new Euro that doesn't feel too too much like more of the same, though given the limited nature of the craftsmen and the commissions, the game plays out very differently with 3 than with 5 (for example).  It probably meets its potential better with a lower range of players.  Nicely done.

On second thought, it is too light.  There doesn't seem to be much going on here.  It is pleasant and all, but there isn't really a lot of decision making.  You kind of take what you get and you win if you catch a couple of breaks and are slightly more efficient than the next guy.

I've always had trouble coming up with a good, easy to explain pick up and deliver game to introduce people to the mechanic.  Now with Valdora available, I think it will do the job quite nicely.  It's true the game does nothing new, except for the pages flipping concept which I thought was pretty neat.  However, I do believe it meshes the different elements of route planning, set collection and a bit of pushing your luck quite well.  Valdora is fast and lite with some subtle strategies involved, certainly a title I wouldn't mind playing again.

RATING: 7
Provisional rating 7 after 1 game.
We learned it from the rules. It was a lot more fiddly than I expected and the rules aren't great so we got a lot of things wrong.  Also we tried to play the variants suggested on here to fix it and I think that confused us even more.

But I could see the fun there.  And I don't mind the deaths.

RATING: 3
A dungeon crawler where you recruit groups of adventurers and send them into a dungeon to get treasure and/or slaughtered. The rules are vague and need some interpretation, but the core of the gameplay is fun enough. For two players, maybe. Any more than that and the downtime between turns is way too long. And the game is so random and unforgiving.

Great to play with someone you play with a lot. Since you need to keep track of the points and what-not.

RATING: 7.5
This is my current favorite Dungeon Crawl game. It does many things right and little wrong. It does play really well with 2-3 players. Downtime is far too much for more players - do not play this game with more than 4! There's also numerous difficulties with the rules which makes it obtuse for new players (this is not a gate way game) and of course, the hundreds of cards - you need to be flexible with house-ruling any confusion points. I still love this game after several plays, so my current rating will stand for some time.

Another 'is it a dungeon crawl or not' game. Luckily this one falls squarely in the 'not a dungeon crawl camp. Dungeon crawls have been done by many publishers and it's refreshing to see designers and publishers trying something different. But wait, you say. In this game you have a party of adventurers, each with a variety of skills that wander around a dungeon killing monsters and collecting treasure. Dungeon crawl, right? Well . . . sort of. The difference here is that each player has a party of adventurers. The players use their adventurers like an adventurer might use a healing potion - they are expendable items used to reach a goal. The rate at which characters are killed in this game might raise some eyebrows until the players realize that that is how to win. Characters represent a variety of tools that the player can use. Some tools are better at killing certain monsters than others. If you don't have the right tools you just discard them and grab a new set of tools. And the discarding happens often due to a variety of nasty monsters and truly deadly traps. Add in the fact that some characters work well with specific other characters and you'll be glad to kill off a character here and there just to try to get something better. 

The number of possible characters, items, monsters, traps, spells etc. etc is absolutely amazing giving the game tremendous replay value. An available expansion further adds to the replay value. The game plays well with just about any number of players in the listed range. The game also plays fairly quickly for a game like this. The rules however are a tad bit confusing in certain parts. This is partly due to the amazing variety of characters, spells, items etc. that break the rules in one way or another. AEG has a nice FAQ that answers most of the questions that will come up during play. The rulebook for the expansion also includes the base game rules rewritten a bit so if you have any questions you could just download that rulebook and see if it answers any of your questions.

I like to use a variant for seeding the dungeon that I think speeds the game up quite a bit. Just get rid of the idea all together! In the end it's an attempt at a bit of strategy but I've noticed it just doesn't work out that well. It also leads to some unbalance if a player gets a good item. All they have to do is put it in one of the tombs that you can get to on turn one. Just seed the dungeon randomly and get on with the game. It'll take a minute instead of 10 - 15 minutes while everyone figures out their "strategy". Nothing ends up playing out as anyone expects so why waste the time.

Overall, I think if you have any attraction to a fantasy dungeon crawl type game I think you will find Tomb an enjoyable romp. It's fun, fairly simple, plays fairly quickly for a game of this type and has endless replay value.

Best dungeon crawler out there.
Your heroes can become extremely powerful, but this is balanced by potentially powerful monsters and traps. 
Could have been more strategic, but I guess that would take out some of the fun in the race to empty the crypts.
We have had a lot of laughs with this game. it's not deep, but there is a lot of action.

RATING: 7
Rules are a disaster. Could have been so much better.

I love so many aspects of this game, I just wish I knew I was playing it right when some of the bat shit crazy situations come up like a boss monster recruiting heroes from the tavern to fight for him happens or when a witch uses powers of other people it makes for some really fun laughable moments but the rules are written so poorly it's difficult to get out on the table.

RATING: 9
I would love to play this game more. The game is so broken it is almost fun for that reason. I love the feel of the game, especially how the first part of the game is almost about bluffing. Did he just put an amazing treasure near the entrance so he can grab it before us, or he did he put a horrible monster in there knowing I would run head long in? Then when the real game begins, beyond the dungeon crawl, it has an aspect of memory to it as you try to remember where you put all of your best stuff. The only negative is that the game can be incredibly frustrating when someone manages to recruit all the rogues and can essentially steal all of your equipment risk free.

RATING: 7.8
Fun game.  We play with some house rules that speed up setup and game play. 

On setup we just randomly put cards in the rooms instead of everyone looking at cards and placing them.

In the tavern, for recruitment, we just do a blind draw.

These speed things up.

I want to love this game soooo much but i cant seem to get by the "bugs"  too many house rules needed to make this game work ... what a shame too because it has such pretty bits!!

Tried to play 3 or 4 times and every time we end up getting stumped to the point of not being able to finish.

I plan on trying one last time before selling this game if I can talk my group into playing it again!!

About as old school as a modern game can get, and random as hell, we like this one a lot.  As long as you're willing to die a fair bit, this is a great beer and pretzels dungeon crawl.  With that said, the rule book is horrible.  You will need the faq, and even then we had to read the long example of play in the back to figure some things out.

Bought with much excitement, Form a Party, Kill the Bad Guys, Take their stuff. Awesomeness personified as far as beers and pretzels go! Or not.

If the rest of the group is super keen then I'll play but as it's my game I won't be taking it along as an option...

Sigh.  I always want to like Dungeon games, but I almost never do.  Reviews look pretty good for Tomb, though, so I might give it a shot.

RATING: 6
Dungeon bash - where you don't really want to get too attached to your characters, they will die. There's no leveling or character development here - just hire a bunch of reckless dudes, send them to the depths to kill monsters and return with loot for you. If you dig that concept, you'll like TOMB, (if you want to build a party and take them on epic adventures, go play an RPG or something, but don't play TOMB, you'll hate it)

Nice bits - although it would have helped to have the backs of the inn cards with the types named rather than just use colours.

Works fine with 2 or 3, just about playable with 4. Wouldn't ever play again with 5 or 6 - just too much downtime. 

Oh, and don't play with an Analysis Paralysis group or game play will slow to a grinding halt as they have to read every character, understand every ability, think about their hand of cards ... and then in combat, what actions to use, how many dice to roll, should I do this or that ... arghhhh, wake me up when it's my turn.

Advanced board much more interesting than the basic side - could do with an expansion to give new maps, or even better some sort of generic maptiles and a 'build your dungeon' type system.

Yeah, cards aren't 'balanced', even xp ratings seems a bit off on some and it's hard to see what others have with all the bits laid out - but it doesn't matter. Get your party, go into the tomb, kill monsters and take their stuff, what's not to like? [Apart from all the problems I've pointed out ...]

** Update, no love for this with the current group, unplayed for over a year ... traded.

RATING: 7.5
In my first game, I tried spending as little time in the Inn as possible.  I got slaughtered to the man twice, and wound up hopelessly behind everyone else.  Despite that, I enjoyed the game immensely - it does a great job of replicating the hack and slash dungeon crawl feel - lots of monsters, lots of loot, lots of adventurers to choose from.  I would definitely play again.

Too much chaos with its chains of effects and counter-effects. Some situations during the game seems almost broken and require constant rule-checks.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The artwork is beautiful, there's a ton of nicely varied characters to play, lots of cool items and monsters...all the makings of a great dungeon crawl.  Where it falls apart for me is that it is just too random.  You can enter a crypt and find 5 treasures (which pretty much guarantees you the win) or 5 monsters.  You can draw really powerful spells (fireball) or really shitty ones (too many to name).  There's just too much randomness that can never average out over the length of the game.  Now if you don't care about winning and just enjoy the experience of the game it will likely be fine for you.  Winning isn't everything for me, but I don't enjoy games that are so random that there's nothing for you to do but move along mechanically and let the game play itself for you.  Tomb is exactly that kind of game.

Beyond that, some mechanic choices are just plain bad.  For example: armor increases the character's hit points.  So if a character with 3hp equips armor that is +2hp, and then takes 4hp of damage the armor becomes a pacemaker.  If he ever loses it for any reason, he's dead.  Sorry, but that is just stupid, especially in a game where you can easily steal items from other players. Armor should either reduce the damage taken in the first place, or absorb hits itself and then be destroyed.

Anyway, it's a nice idea but the game doesn't work for me without a bunch of house rules and I'm not willing to do that when I have much better dungeon crawls available (Descent, Runebound).

Well you gather a party of dungeoneers together and tool them up with spells, prayers, tactics and Equipment. You then raid the TOMB and enter crypts to gather treasure, beat traps and kill monsters. This all sounds pretty awesome but the whole game just seems so random and everything is just a case of luck. Some people may enjoy it but we just felt it was all a bit pointless. 1 Play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Based on 1 play with 6 players: I think my rating for this game would be higher if it weren't quite so long. Perhaps now that we know the rules and everything it will go faster. But still, there's not much here of interest. This is a pretty standard dungeon crawling affair. Our first game took 3ish hours, though, and the downtime became a royal pain after the first hour or so when interest started dwindling and one player clearly had the lead (and held it for the rest of the game.) I'd play again but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.

Yep - this game is pretty cool.  Exploring dungeons in an effort to kill things and steal stuff.  Lots of fun, and a different type of dungeon delving that doesn't require as much set up or time as something like [gameid=17226].  The huge number of different characters to add to your party make it immensely replayable.

Dungeon hack where each player leads a competing party. The parties don't seem to be able to fight each other but different players will take control of the monsters in each crypt an opponent enters. So you do get to fight your opponents in a fashion. The short rulebook required some rulings on the fly. It took about 3 hours. The way the board was laid out and the way you built and equiped a party was quite gamey. It had less of an RPG/narrative feel than some other games in the genre.

2 plays (2p, 3p) - liked it, fun to roll dice, think about character dice-powers. Some doubts around the edges, but willing to play again. Like many games, if we can keep the game time down, it's a better experience. (PS. how did the cliche about "Tavern Recruit then Loot Underground" start? D&D? Mythology I believe tends to give more resonating purpose like "to marry the princess the king who hates you says you must...")

Takes a bit long, and, even though I dislike the overuse of the term, I think I'd classify it as "broken". However, I am a sucker for modifiers upon modifiers and stupidly overpowered combos, hence I'm going to rate it a 6. I might've rated it a 7 if it was shorter.

A lot of moving parts to this one, with cards constantly being drawn and attached both to Characters and Monsters.

I feel bad rating a game this low but I really don't want to play this again and will try hard to avoid it.  

That seems to be what a 3 implies.  Having said that I feel compelled to explain.

I'm not offended at all by randomness, in fact I appreciate it greatly in some games but this is just too severe for what you get (and how drudgingly long it takes).

You spend (too much) time setting up and recruiting characters then go in and you're unlucky enough to hit one of the biggest baddies on your first tomb. You're entirely wiped out.  Watch the other players take the easy 1 & 2 tombs while you turn after turn recruit to rebuild your team (yuck!).  Go back in and right away get wiped out again because there's no easy tombs left and your team has no good power-ups.

Meanwhile another player stumbles on a tomb of goodies and no monsters then proceeds to run away with the rest of the game.  That alone seems to define the victor.

I suppose there is some fun element in the complete unknown of how nasty what you might find could be and giving up all hope of advancing on good choices.  I could tolerate playing this with my kids who would find it fun just seeing who randomly gets wiped out.  For that alone I'll give it a 3 and not a 2.  But really, it's way too long for that.

The rule ambiguities and design discrepancies only add to a disagreeable experience.

I finally played this for the first time. I went in with very high expectations. Unfortunately, they were not met. Tomb is a confusing muddle of contradictory or inadequately explained rules, a fiddley combat system that just confuses, and a turn structure that makes playing this game with an AP type pure torture. Even the set-up of the game is a drag. For more detail, just read this review  www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/339508, as it captures my thoughts on this game, spot on.

At this point, I don't think I'll ever try this again.  If a game doesn't grab me on the first play, why should I keep trying on the hope that it might get better?  There's too many other games out there to try.

One final thought: anyone with even a hint of color blindness, STAY AWAY from this game! The dice are hard enough to tell apart with normal vision.

I fell in love with this game the 1st time I played it. While it has serious rule issues, these can be ironed out over online research and discussion with players. Unfortunately, it looks like at this time, the game is discontinued. The game is much better with the Cryptmaster rules.

RATING: 6
Good old fashioned dungeon crawl.  Players recruit their dungeon party at the Inn, drafting from an enormous selection of fighters, wizards, clerics, or rogues.  When they've tooled up with items and spells, they hit the dungeon board - an assortment of crypts - pre-seeded with traps, monsters and treasure.  When a crypt is raided, the player to the left or right plays out the encounter.  Defeated traps and monsters are banked for experience, while treasure is either banked or "attached" for use.  Good, solid game - bit of downtime if you're out of the action while a crypt is being resolved, but turns between crypts are lightning fast.  Oh yeah, you can form a party of rogues and just go and pickpocket off the other players - nice!  Game ends when the crypts are empty.  Ton of pieces, and a ton of work went into the cards - lots of text and variation.  Two sided dungeon too - basic or advanced.  Good effort.

I really struggle with how to rate this one. This probably is the best dungeon crawl game I will ever play as the mechanics are solid. However, while I would have loved this game as a kid or teenager, I find myself getting less and less interested with the genre and all of the juvenile artwork that comes with it. It almost seems like these games start with excessive cleavage and gory monsters and then build a game around that. Talisman, the only fantasy game I enjoy anymore, has more room for the imagination while not overpowering you with the cheese.

We have really enjoyed this game, and thought it was pretty balanced.  However, I am by no means a "dungeon crawl" master.  It plays great with two people and doesn't lag at all.  Our first game took about 100 minutes and that was even checking the rules.  Good fun.

Most recent purchase. Read the rules. Ready to play a game. Looking forward in trying this game for the very first time. Theme interest me a whole lot. Reason why I decided to buy Tomb. The 60 minute printed on the box is also appealling. When I first say it, I thought, "Cool, play 2-3 games in one evening."

UPDATE: Played it. Game says playing time is 60 minutes. I have a hard time seeing this game being played in 60 minutes.

Just explaining the rules can be complex. I imagine 60 minutes would be for very experience players and modified rules.

It took us couple few hours with the rule explainations to play a complete game. The text on the characters and cards alone is a handful to handle for the first time. Some of them are a bit tricky and could be played the wrong way if read it wrong. Overall, don't think it would affect the game result that much.

Overall, I did enjoy the game very much. Something I plan to play again. Hopefully Tomb will be a hit with most players I play with.

Update: Played it again. Overall a solid, entertaining game. Too many treasure cards in the game. Number of creature cards are OK. Little bit more traps would of be nice. On the other hand I recall a game which we had like 25 characters dead in one game because of 2 particular creatures. Guess it depends on what creatures shows up in the tomb.

With Items at the inn and treasure cards in the tomb, a character could be easily be non-stoppable quite easily. Need to be a little more challenging. 

One of the actions you can do with a rogue is try and steal an item or treasure from another player. I found in the games I played, we didn't try to steal that much. 

Overall I enjoy this game and am glad that I got this game in my collection. I know some people who doesn't find it that interesting but I do. People's taste can't be discussed. Everyone has their own taste where boardgames are concerned.

This is a game I would love to love as it's just got so many good points, especially its solo playing potential, but it's let down terribly by its rules.  I think the publishers would have been better off designing some intelligable rules rather than tarting about with a character wall chart, which to be honest is about as much use as a choclate fire guard.  So please ditch the pretty pictures and spend some time re-working the rules, because this could be a winner!

From Trade - Belfort + Monolith
This time I used my own solo rules.

1) Take out 20 characters and stack them (shuffled randomly).
2) Take out 4 more characters and start with 2 of them; place the other 2 back in the box.
3) Take out 2xD20s. Set one at "16", and the other will be used after each turn. 
4) Take the first 2 characters from the stack and place them in the Inn. They are available to recruit.
5) Take your turn normally. After your turn take 1xD20 and roll it. If you roll under the number that was set, then the counter drops by 1 (e.g. I rolled a "7" and the counter is set at 16; drop the counter to 15). If you roll it and it's over, discard the 2 visiting characters in the inn out of the game, and draw 2 new ones.

Game ends: 
1) If you run out of characters in the inn, you cannot get anymore help. If all the characters are gone, you only have 1 last turn to clear all tombs (by turn I mean that your counter is reset to 16, and when you roll over the number that is set, you lose). If you cannot complete, you lose the game. If you clear the tomb before this happens, you win the game.

2) Alternate conditions (highest score): same as #1 above, but each tomb card left is counted against your VPs collected (negative based on the amount left). Score is based on the rules in the book.

This game has potential to be a favorite. This is a classic dungeon running game. Gather your party, gear, and spells and enter the tomb. High quality cards and artwork.

Population of the tomb is done by the players, which adds a bit of pre-game strategy. The dice mechanic is interesting, and you often throw a lot of them. Traps are done well, and offer an excellent danger mechanic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun and reasonably short dungeon crawl.  The interaction of the numerous special powers is particularly interesting and enjoyable.  The sheer number of characters and Tomb cards means that this will stay fresh for a long time.

A few caveats, though, which keep this from a higher rating.  First, it is only this good with 2 or at most 3 players.  With more than that the game is much longer and filled with down time.  Second, the rules as written are pretty bad.  The designers are trying to plug the holes here and on their website, but it still means that there are many circumstances that you just have to make your own call.

RATING: 6.7
A really great game. Travel through an old tomb and kill all the monsters as you go. Collect the Xps and win the game. The rules as written are pretty bad and need a lot of re reading, but the theme is brilliantly captured and there are lots of things to do with the cards you get. I love this one and look forward to playing it for a good long time to come.

I wish the game was a little shorter, but even so, it's still very fun. It's a little annoying when a player ends up with an insane character due to the items he found, and can't lose a battle.  It's a trade off, but we usually just deal cards into the tombs, instead of the players placing them, to shorten the set up, since the game takes so long.
60 minutes would be perfect for this game.

Likes: Great variety of characters and tones of differnt "tomb" cards. Alot of replay value here.  The art work is quite nice as well.

Overall: I really think my rating of this game will go up with more experience. Playing a five player game with four first time players (myself included) made downtime really bad as everyone tried to get down the battle system.

Played according to their 'solo' rules.  Can see the promise, but honestly their solo rules are filled with holes (and worse, loopholes.)  There are several characters and items, for example, that totally negate the 'penalty' of stashing up at cards at the inn.

Plus, keeping up with all of your party's stuff, their cards, and then the optimum plays for the crypts, etc...it just isn't very smooth.  Plus, the interaction isn't there whatsoever.

Then there's the fact that several cards boost movement (who cares how fast you get there in solo?  There's no time limit!), affect YOU being the CM against other players (doesn't happen), and so on and so forth.

I expect this to be a point or two higher after the full game gets played...but I'll keep the "solo kind of sucks" comments.

The system is pretty rich and full of promise, though.  This would be the easiest game to expand, and relatively cheaply as it's all cards and cardboard characters.  A "full sized" expansion could include a new double-sided crypt board.

So...yeah.  It's worth playing.  I just wouldn't bother playing it solo.



UPDATE:  Played 2p.  Sadly, it didn't get that much more impressive.  Just not nearly as many "screw" cards as I was hoping for.  That leaves the only interaction the pickpocket thing (untenable late game, for sure) and racing to nab a crypt before your opponent does.

If there's an expansion, I want MANY more direct interaction style cards put into the game.  It just became sort of a random race game.

Also, it may be just us, but characters become tanks in this game FAR too easily.  My brother and I very quickly had two characters that were essentially untouchable by monsters.  My "tank" had something that caused monsters to roll one less of each of their die, AND had armor that capped damage at two.  In return, he threw like 8 combat dice thanks to natural abilities and some item that gave him more dice for each item he had.  Wee?


And to cap all this off, I lost by two points because at one point my brother wandered into a 3 or 4 card crypt and it was pure VP items.



EDIT:  Traded away to a better home on March 12th, 2009.  Via con dios, Tomb.

RATING: 7.5
You really get the dungeon crawler feeling, without too long a set-up time or too complex a set of rules. The large number of cards seems to give it some replayability at least. On the minus side, definitely low on player interaction (though not comlpetely devoid of it) which makes downtime a little boring, especially if you play with people that take time reading cards etc... (otherwise the turns should be pretty quick). Components are good but some of the illustrations are a little ugly to me. Overall, a rather good experience, plays quick enough and rich in theme.

More of a push your luck, than a typical dungeon crawl game. Though it's still fun to play and offers a solitaire version of play, which is always nice. The rule book and abilities of the characters, could've been written a bit better, but it's still playable and most questions have been answered, in the updated FAQ's.

Game components are nice and functional, but nothing spectacular, except for the very nicely made big tile bag. Very nice and funcional.

Overall, it's a fun game, but may not be what's expected. Your characters will die and quite often. So becoming attached to your characters, is out of the question. There's a bit of luck, but it's pretty even for everyone. It's definitely different, for a dungeon type game and I give the designer credit, for breaking the typical game play style, of most dungeon crawl type game, but it does take some getting used to.

I'd recommend trying this one if possible, before forking out the money for a copy. Especially now that it's OOP and starting to run high. I don't think I'd pay much more than retail for the game, but am glad to have a copy of the game in my collection.

Many thanks, to my friend Jake, who introduced me to this game.

This game has serious rulebook presentation issues, download one of the FAQ or guides here and use that to help get past the initial hurdles.

I wish we had played with random seeding rather than not but the game was ok with one really wild moment. I got this game in a math trade and will hold onto it for a few more plays at least.

The game is conceptually more interesting than it actually plays but isn't nearly as bad as I've seen other people react to it.

I didn't find the rulebook to be that badly written, as the general consensus points out.
But, then again, I didn't have a hard time figuring out Marvel Heroes rulebook either.Perhaps it's my geek decoder ring?

The Lady and I have tried to play this one several times, but we just can't seem to get into it. Although, I'm not a big fan of games where you don't stay focused on making your single party/character expand and grow in power. So, that's the likely reason I can't get into it, since your party dies off quickly, and easily, preventing the players from focusing on making their party better. Simple point grabs whilst sacrificing one's party members seems to go against my expectations of fantasy adventure games.

Still willing to give it a second, third, and more chances though.

Innovative mechanic with the character party, where you shouldn't get too attached to your characters. It can be enjoyed with the right group of players in the right situation, but it's not enough of tactic possibilities, but rather run and hack and slash annd get lucky woth the dice. The random factor is a bit too high in combination with quite a lot of downtime sometimes, I couldn't even imagine playing it with more that 4 players.

I really enjoyed this game, but character selection from the inn took way too long on other players turns. I would only play this again with a 1 minute sand timer.
We got a rule wrong about the order of attacks between heroes and monsters and it made the game a little weird. I hear it is pretty common to get a rule wrong from that initial set. 
I am excited to try the Cryptmaster expansion and see how it plays.

My group likes this, probably more than I did.  (It was a birthday present from them!).  Heavy on theme.  More for the imaginitive group maybe than analytical players.  I liked the artwork, nice quality bits, buckets of battleAxe dice, team member drafting.  I did not like some ambiguities in the rules, very low player interaction.  You have very little to do with each other, other than racing to tombs, stealing an occassional item, and drafting characters.  That might be enough, though.  Have to get in more plays to see how I feel about it overall.

RATING: 4
An okay dungeon crawler that's random even for dungeon crawlers.  Not nearly as tedious as things like Descent.  Unfortunately, like most games of this genre, there's a lot of downtime between player turns where you don't do much.  Players to the left and right of the current player play as the crypt master (the bad guys), giving them a little to do, but there's still not much of consequence until it's your turn proper.  Gives you time to go to the bathroom or get a snack, I guess.

Had a blast the first time that I played this, it ran a little long though (2.5 hrs.). The last crypt had 4(5 with a special ability)monsters and there were some pretty complicated rules situations created with the combo, but we decided to bag the last room and call it a game.

I only had to hit the monster once to kill it, but I missed, and it proceeded to kill my entire party. Whee!!

I was intrigued by good friend Ted Cheatham's video review, particularly the part where he said it was a "dungeon crawl" that can be played in an hour.  Well,  our game took us well over two hours to play, and there just isn't enough fun here to justify that duration.

The rules were not clear on many issues, and there was an information overload with all of the character powers, items, spells, etc.  

I'm not a big fan of dungeon crawl games, and this one didn't do anything to improve my opinion of the genre.

Solid dungeon crawl that probably won't stand up to repeated plays because underneath the surface lies an underdeveloped game.  The hour playtime is a lie, it will take you longer.  Lots of interesting combos with the characters, spells, items, etc.  A little bit like a watered down version of descent.  We encountered no rules problems in our game, but I understand there is a FAQ and errata.  The way you seed the dungeon with the traps, treasures, and monsters makes for some interesting decisions and is a neat twist on the genre.  It can also lead to very random situations where one player might find several dungeons full of nothing but treasure but another player hits dungeons with one piece of treasure laid by them and the rest huge monsters.  

Ultimately, the game is extremely random and has some serious balance issues that will hurt its usefulness as a serious game and will hurt its replayability, but that doesn't attract from the fun- you kill monsters and take their stuff!  As a two hour long D&D replacement, its pretty good.  

Another bright spot is the components- tons of variety, and good to great art all around.  Nice quality too.

The box said it would play in 60 minutes, and take up to six players. We tried to figure this out at a boardgame meetup, and it took over two hours to get three turns in before we called it quits. Definitely needs an experienced player to tell us what the heck is going on. The characters were diverse and colorful enough, with all sorts of stats (actually tomb dice) to indicate their relative areas of expertise (whether in combat, pickpocketing, casting spells, healing, etc.), so it actually felt just like my first AD&D game--there was a sense of mystery and wonder. This illusion was crushed with poorly written rules, where the various cards seemed to contradict each other. The game reminds me of Arkham Horror, which is not a good thing--lots of cards to create the 'AI' of the game. What it boils down to is this: we take a party of characters, go somewhere, encounter some traps, kill some monsters, and get some treasure. Without some intelligence behind it all, like in Descent, this gameplay seems flat. I'd rather be playing Runebound, if I am going to put in this much effort.

Update (01/16/12): Who am I kidding? I'm never going to play this again. It's a '2'.

My friend and I demo-ed this game at GenCon in Indy and found it very fun. I bought the game and tried it solitare this morning. The game is very fun to play solitare, since the cards are randomly dealt, the tombs can be very different every time. 

I also like the different classes as well as the multiple class characters that they have. I almost would like to see way that a person could create their own character and take them through the tombs.

A decent-enough dungeoner with some back-stabbing thrown into the mix.  Could have been improved with better planning (item deck is also called "blacksmith" in addition to item deck), and balance isn't maintained, even with everyone trying to drag down one party, some become unstoppable.  Also, the game favors hoarding of cards, such that non-magic users can have all the cards for spells and it seems to favor camping out at the inn for prolonged (boring) periods just drawing until you have ALL the cards in your hand or discarded.  Lame.  Could have been better.

Dungeon crawl board game with a pleasant spin on classic rpgs.  Recruit up to 5 PCs, equip them with spells & items (tactics), enter the dungeon and clear out rooms (facing curses, traps, monsters & treasure).  Much better than Talisman, Dungeon, Arkham Horror.  Has the problem of mini-maxing, but the pressure of getting XP once one player starts prevents a lot of that. Attacking other players also possible.  Needs to be played to see how well it is.

Box top has a split corner that needs mending.

Initial thoughts after 1 incomplete play:

An interesting game that has a lot of replayablity.  The only problem is there is a lot of information that you have to remember about your characters, items, spells, prayers and treasures (this information is on the cards however).

I really like the recruiting of characters and the variety of cards that you place in the "Tomb".

RATING: 6
This game is exactly what Steve Jackson's "Munchkin" should have been.  It's not so much a dungeon crawler than it is a brake-neck race to get more loot than your opponents.  Backstabbing, dirty trickery and generally ruthless behavior are strongly encouraged by the games rules and treasures, and provide many of the "Oh, Snap!" moments.  
This game is extremely frustrating the first couple of plays through, epically if you are trying to play seriously and strategically.  Your entire party WILL DIE. Often horribly, usually instantly.  Once you and your gaming group realize this and then decide "that's okay because there is a fresh new, and possibly better party waiting to be recruited at the inn," gameplay gets much more enjoyable.  ...At least until you fail that single trap roll and every single party member is instantly killed and all that treasure you had pimped them out with is lost to the abyss...  That sucks.

A little long for my taste, and there's a lot of downtime, especially with 5 players, some of whom haven't played it before and none of whom have played it more than once or twice.  Still, it was fun (especially since I won).

In Tomb the players play leaders of adventuring parties, who delve into the titular dungeon in search of traps to disarm, monsters to defeat, and treasure to steal. The crypts within the tomb get progressively more complex as they get farther from the tomb entrance - this is measured by the number of "tomb" cards they contain. A tomb card is a monster, trap, or treasure. Any tomb card resolved successfully scores XP (victory points), though treasures may be equipped for game effects. However this risks losing the treasure if the equipping character dies.

Players will recruit characters from the inn and those characters will adventure into the tomb. There's some fun in the cynical theme, since at no time are the players risking their own skins, and the monsters and traps are dangerous enough that heroes will die often. This can be played up for cheap laughs. There's also some strategy in party composition along the axes of character class and party size, as a party may hold 1-5 characters. It's tempting to build up a super-powered party at the inn, but the game offers several incentives to break from that plan in the way of carrots (earlier access to the easier crypts, heroes which get better if they're in a small party) and sticks (traps and monsters that scale by party size, monsters who get to use character spells and items).

There's a lot of chaos though. One player was hit by a trap that wiped out his entire 5-character party, and that cost him enough time that he was forced out of contention. This is how we learned that there's some danger in a large party size, as the character did n damage to every character in the party where n was the party size. (Characters range from 2-4 HP though they may gain more HP through armor and effects.) 

The game keeps non-phasing players involved by assigning the player to the left or right of the phasing player as "crypt master" to make all decisions for the monsters and traps in the scenario. There's also some direct interaction in that you get to steal other players' stuff if your rogues can make an opposed skill check against another player's rogues; however that carries some risk to the stealing player in that the rogue can get himself killed. I like how the game handles this form of direct interaction; imposing potential consequences for stealing avoids the Munchkin problem where everyone just steals everyone else's stuff and the game never ends. Stealing can sometimes be the right thing to do, but it's far from the default choice as it is in some games which implement the mechanic. 

I'm not sure Tomb knows what it wants to be. There are a lot of strategic elements in there but also a lot of direct interaction and chaos. The game length on the box is a total fiction; it says 60 minutes but even with experience I wouldn't expect to be done in less than 90.

This game is unique that not every one will like it. It is a fantastic dungeon crawling board game with tons of playing characters and Inn cards for great replayability. The only problem i experienced with this game is long playing time, analysis paralysis due to the big number of characters, cards and interaction among players, terribly written rules (now resolved with revised rules) and poor dice production (color). Though it suffered from various setback, it is still a marvelous creation of a fantasy RPG theme board game with an interesting game system. I love it!

RATING: 6
A light dungeon game with a clever dungeon-seeding mechanic for the set up. This is a bit of an odd bird because it goes against what many people enjoy in these types of games. Rather than being a player's alter-ego, characters are as expendable as used tissue. There is little sense of discovery since you already know about a third of the cards on the board. Memory is a significant element to play, which is unusual for this genre. It also has some of the problems that plague many of these sorts of games - overpowered items and a playtime that runs a bit too long for what it is. 

But even with all of that, it's still a pretty fun game. Check your dungeon-crawl expectations at the door and you just might find a good, very light game of creating character combos, monster killing and looting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Not as much a dungeon crawl as it is a race, full of unbalanced, chaotic game play which makes it great fun for [i]the right group.[/i] At first I wondered why there were so many characters provided, but I quickly learned why: this game can be a meat grinder. There's definitely a push your luck element to the game, which can make your party's lives quite short. It's also an exercise in reading other players, looking at their moves from set-up through exploration.

This feels like a game that is best played fast with a certain amount of good-natured nastiness. Not one for rule lawyers or those needing balance. 

Sweet spot seems to be 3-4 players max. More than that brings crippling downtime.

This is the first, and only, game my group ever gave up on.  After about 90 minutes, we just decided that no one was really having that much fun and packed it up.  We spent another hour postgame discussing all manner of things that would make it better.  I think we all wanted it to be a good game, but it's just not worth the effort, not when there are so many other, better games out there that don't require much, or any, tinkering at all.

Basically, once I realized that I would always rather play Runebound, it was an easy decision to put this game up for trade.  [It could just as easily have been WoW the Board Game, or Dungeon Twister, or a dozen other games, but once I thought of one that was so clearly superior out of the box, I didn't need to think twice about Tomb.]

I'd like to like this game better, but it doesn't seem to have been constrained and defined enough to really shine as a rules system.  It's taken a tremendous effort to try exploring corner cases and even some basic rules and collect them in an external FAQ.

RATING: 7
Well, this is my take on TOMB.
I really enjoyed it and would/will play again at anytime.
It is NOT for everyone, however.
If you do not like chaos, stop reading.
If you grow connected to things and don't want to see them crumble, stop reading.
If you like preparation and hate seeing your best laid plans crumble, stop reading.

This game is -b-r-u-t-a-l-

That's it.  Deal with it.  It does tend to affect/effect each player the same over the long course of the game, so at no point can you feel like your game was just shot to hell because of bad rolls or a terrible monster pull in the crypt...
The player interaction is actually higher than I had suspected; which is a good thing.

House-Rule Whore of a game, but alot of fun, if you don't go in thinking it's a game based on what you are seeing...based on it's theme, look and feel. It is NOT  a Descent-type...it is NOT really even a dungeon crawl, really.  It is more of a "push your luck" and play the odds-type game, imo...

TONS of variety, tons of fun...I really enjoy it.
One niggle...there are alot of oddities with certain card interactions...we, as a group, tried to resolve disputes with some logic and what we thought the designer's intent was.  Most of it wasn't too awful; it just causes some small delays in trying to figure out what to do when the Tomb goes boom!!!  ;)

A dungeon hack where players compete against each other. Time is spent building a party and then sending them into the dungeon to kill or be killed. Don't grow too attached to party members since most will die! This game is a load of fun, but can have significant amounts of down-time between turns. When combined with Tomb: Cryptmaster, the game doubles in size, offering a very good re-playability.

RATING: 4
A neat concept, but poorly explained and imo poorly playtested rules produce a boring game.  A lot of the spells are game-breakingly powerful because they are so potent and you can use them at will, so after the midgame it's just a question of who can run from crypt to crypt the fastest.  That is boring.  Also, by the midgame you may be eliminated from any realistic chance of winning but have to play the rest of the game out, more boring.  There's no good way to catch up after the mid-point.  Oh and also the rulebook is incomplete.  Please go back and work on the design some more, the idea of sending expendable henchpersons into the dungeon to bring back treasure or die trying is a good one.

One of the more brutal games I have played but having a tavern full of willing recruits softens the blow somewhat. This game is a lot deeper than one might suspect. There is a tremendous potential for interaction that deepens the game and sometimes the doom. Includes Cryptmaster expansion.

Currently my favorite dungeon crawl game.  Dense, somewhat richer and more complicated than similar games (which are generally too simple anyway), tons of combinations and variations, good re-playability, etc.  It's still somewhat light and reliant on luck as typical to the genre, but very good at what it does and does it in a reasonable play length.

I'd rather play Dungeon or Cave Troll...  The only good idea I like from this game is the party creation and character recruitment options.  Everything else about this game screams not-fun randomness.  It was so not fun that our group just aborted it after a handful of turns.  Please break out Descent instead.  This isn't even close to a Top 10 dungeon crawler.

Were it not for the pretty badly organized rules and some problems with cards, this could well be a "9". Seems to be one of the best Fantasy/Dungeoncrawler Experiences so far for me (after one slow - due to the fiddly figuring out of several rules - play, so I might be mistaken here). Time will tell how it holds up.

Houserules:
Warriors start with one equipment, Rogues start with one tactic. Combos start with one each.
Less characters at the inn to start.
Some face up crypt cards.
40 treasure cards taken out variant.

Card: for the fallen. Instead of recruiting 3 characters, recruit 1 character for each character in the dead pile (up to 3 characters).

Setup: draw 5, keep 2, 3 to inn.

No draw action (or just 1 card). 

10 card hand limit.
Spells, Prayers, Tactics can't be moved onced attached. (only items)
Max 1 Traited card per character.

Allow CM to use monster and target any character from another party.

To balance, you can use as many traited cards (1 per trait).

After each successful crypt, you automatically draw 1 inn cards.

You can never draw more than 1 inn card per turn (regardless of what your character or power says)

Mosters no weapons.

In crypts, all cards saying "monsters" can be used to target players if used by a monster.

Thanks to junesen for trading this at BGG.CON 2009 (math trade). Traded away in 2010 for some Dreamblade stuff.

Just because a game has solo rules doesn't mean it's fun to play solo. It is an okay way to learn the rules, though. You just lose the race aspect. I think it might be okay to play with a group, but I don't expect it to be great. Expecting it to be about a 5. I eventually got an offer I couldn't refuse, so I traded it instead of giving it another shot.

This was an intersting one. The game itself is simple in theory but very complex in practice. 

I enjoyed the Gauntlet-like dungeon raid idea of the game and the artwork is amazing. However, the combination of event, item and hero special rules and abilities is simply skull shattering- in my first game I felt completely overwhelmed by the huge mass of information the game spades at you. I imagine this will put off many first time gamers, unlucky for them as I think this blast of information will ease with more plays.

I enjoyed the experience despite achieving very little, although I'm not sure how much of this was just down to been swept along on the "wow" factor of all of the cards and heroes. Compelled to try again.

Solid game to hang out and play without much thought required. It's a game where you run into the Dungeon kill monsters, encounter traps and get loot. Fairly quick to teach, quick to play, and not a lot of strategy.

The rules for distributing loot initially cause problems with "breaking" the game, but you can just randomize it and it works a lot better. 

Players can have downtime from someone else attacking a tomb, so you do have times you're sitting around for 5-10 minutes waiting for your turn.

If you are in the mood to take some adventurers into a Tomb and kill as many monsters as you can, escape traps and collect loads of treasure, then this is going to be fun! This game comes with a mega bag full of cardboard adventurers. You draw several at the start of the game and choose who will be among your team. Once you feel like you have enough in your party, you can get equipment...and more equipment...until you feel ready to delve into the dark Tomb. When you open those doors to the Tomb you will travel to each crypt and uncover what vile trouble lays within. But Hay...sometimes there's nothing in there but treasure...Yeah!

The original rulebook is overly confusing and very ambiguous. Take the time to download a rules summary sheet and FAQ and you will really enjoy the experience.

The game centres around the characters you draft. They'll be strong in one of the 4 things you need to roll for (attacking, skill, magic or healing), quality being a function of what dice you get to roll. Each character also has a bonus power in text which can be important. So draft a party of characters, take some turns collecting bonus/action cards until you feel you're ready, or bored, and then move on out. Your mission is to clear those crypts. Crypts contain trap cards (roll dice to beat), then monster cards (roll dice to beat) then treasure cards (bank 'em). Every card you beat is worth VPs. Most VPs wins once all the crypts are clear. If you die, go back and recruit another party. You'll know some of the cards at some of the crypts from the seeding at gamestart (ie go to where you've placed cards you can beat!!). There's some decent decision making in getting a good symbiotic party together, and each crypt is a mini-puzzle on how best to fight it in terms of character order and cards to play. But game pace is very uneven. Turns are either whizz past fast or cryptlike slow. Fights can take a while as others just sit and watch - there can be a ton of dice to roll, cards to go through, combat rounds can go back and forth. Not that exciting really. The theme is great. It's just a big dicefest slugfest though, a race to beat things faster than the other players, and the downtime marked it down for me in the end.

Pure Amerithrash! Dungeon crawl dice fest. Don't get too attached to your party's characters or their attachments. Loot crypts after engaging traps, curses, monsters. 2 sided board. Beware of the manual.

I hope this gets reprinted, with character cards instead of character cardboard standees.

I have not played this solitaire, yet.

The component quality and HUGE assortment of characters that can be part of a player's party are what I like most about this game. The fact the player to the left or right of you could possibly be the person controlling the traps and monsters (marked on the board) is a nice touch as well.

The game is very nice looking, but that is all it has going. I cannot say I am a fan of the genre though (character based monster fighting with lots of dice). Thee is too much down time, since a players turn can last 20 minutes or 10 seconds and this makes it dull for the others. The cards and characters are also not really balanced due to the fact that the draws are luck based and you can be stuck with a party lacking a certain trait, which can really hurt you. There is also a lot to read, so to really play properly, you wouls have to read what everyone else has, which would be painfully long on each turn. If you don't like the genre, avoid it, you will just like it less.

Rulebook has too many errors and omissions to be considered even passingly good. Cards refer to other cards that were apparently dropped during development. The rules don't say (at least anywhere I read...) HOW or WHERE the parties enter the tomb, so we just assumed it was the end near the "1" card crypts for the small board. We found that empty crypts become hallways, but nowhere does it mention if the walls disappear - again we had to assume. I will follow the discussions on the post-release development to see if this game takes shape further into what could end up being a really cool game. I just resent dropping $60.00 to be on the beta playtest team without getting credit for it!

Having played again, all I can say is that if AEG is going to continue producing board games, I really really hope they spend some time in playtesting with outside groups.

First play, we didn't take much time to read all the cards and their (possible) interactions, and we didn't pay all that much attention to where we put the cards on the map, so maybe it deserves a second chance because of that... This way, it was way too random... even for me.

The play time on this game is severely understated unless you have experienced players that know most of the cards. The average player will spend a lot of time just reading their cards and making sure that everything happens when and if it should. I understand how that would frustrate some, but I still enjoy the game with all it's variability immensely. I decided to play with some of the variations found here to ease play and the game worked out much better for players. Overall, I love fantasy games and this one just has so many possibilities that I love it's replayability. You have to play with others that enjoy the fantasy or video game type of play or people will soon get bogged down with the details and could lose interest since it does take a long time to play with even four people.

Dungeon game that manages to include loads of interesting elements (spells, traps, monsters, treasure) yet still remains simple to play.

The abundance of cards (300!) should keep the game fresh, although this also occasionally causes some problems working out how card effects should be resolved.

I can perhaps see some of the influence of games like Talisman (for example, moving to board spaces then tackling the cards placed there in prescribed order, monsters before rewards).

Plays well from 2-4 players, but perhaps drags too long with more.

Components are great - except for the few errors on cards & the board!

The rules could be better & clearer - some terms are used inconsistently and there are obvious errors. FAQs are available though with updates promised.

WARNING: Given the errors in rules, cards & the board, it sounds like there will be many corrections and alterations by the time a 2nd Edition is issued. Will there be an "update kit" of some kind? Or will expansions be able to replace certain components such as cards & rules?

Quite light game, a bit umbalanced due to the heavy randomness (some XP value are not so well tuned with the power of the card they refer in my opinion) but fun to play. Rules are the worst part of it, very poorly written and incapable to cover all the possibilities occurring during a game (the FAQ is a must). I feel also the monsters mechanics a bit 'forced': using the same cards of the heroes, simply changing the references on the cards, causes a lot of strange things to happen during combat; but I have to admit that this kind of mechanics works on the front of variety, allowing a really huge amount of comboes between card effects and hero abilities - and 84 heroes and 300 cards are really a lot!
All in all I like the game.

The upside:

The downside:
-Poorly developed. With the same ideas it could be a better game.
-No sense of storytelling or progretion as I like to see when there's dungeons and heroes involved.
-Surprisingly, or not, unfun.

RATING: 7
1st play thoughts : like almost every dungeoncrawler other than Dungeonquest and Dungeon, Tomb simply takes Too Long For What It Is (TLFWII). The attempt to bring more tactics into a dungeoncrawl simply provides frustration when any semblance of balance is thrown out the window when someone draws a uber-powerful card, and another gets a worthless card.
That said, it is probably the best fantasy adventure boardgame I've played [b]in simulating an RPG [/b](D&D session). The fact that you are recruiting a [b]party[/b], that will cycle thru many adventurers after dying horribly against powerful monsters, is a nice element that raises it up and helps it stand out amongst the dungeoncrawl crowd.
I'd say Descent is still the leader in strategic dungeon-delving boardgames (and it's scary saying Descent is more balanced than Tomb), but if Tomb could get the gamelength down to 90 minutes, it would go up a full point rating.

After more thinking, Tomb's problems are rooted in it trying to be strategic (the seeding of the dungeon, etc) but most strategy is eradicated by the gross disparity in items, monsters, traps, and rolls. I think the game may be improved for me if some of the more egregiously unbalanced items were removed. It's not like that Blessed Blade needs +3 Blue dice in addition to doubling the damage of that character! And useless spells like Slow simply have to go. It's examples like that which call into question the designer's performance and decisions with the game. They may have made the typical mistake of overpowering (power creep) cards as they added so many to increase the total to 200.

RATING: 7
There is NO reason this game should be as fun as it is. It's random and chaotic with odd spurts of downtime between player turns. The scoring system rewards only the most extreme player- you either go super attack or super fast. 

However, I found myself enjoying myself immensely throughout the entirety of Tomb. It's fun to recruit a party of characters and watch them all die a couple turns later. It's hilarious when half the characters in the game are dead by the end. It's also fun to walk into an impossible battle and watch your enemy get zero successes on like 20 dice.

Overall: Really, the wild randomness and crazy swings of luck are all part of the charm of Tomb. It has no business being this much fun, BUT IT IS! Also, it's pretty good with nearly any number of players.

This game ended up being much "funner" than I thought. This will definitely get a lot of play. The only downside to this game is that when it's not your turn and you are playing with 3-6 people, you are waiting along time for things to come back around to you. The 1 hour that they suggest on the box is completely false advertisement. How about 1 hour per player!!!

There is a good game in here somewhere.

The good:
Raiding the tomb is rather fun.  It is also great fun to play as the monsters and rip an opponent to shreds.

A number of interesting choices to make when filling the tomb.

The bad:
Some printing errors and a few ambiguous rules.

Very slow to get to the fun as everyone spends the first few turns looking through the character stack picking characters or drawing inn cards.

The inn cards are incredibly unbalanced, and it is almost never worth it to consume your turn playing an inn card.  Furthermore, monsters occasionally get stuck with inn cards that can't be used making some fights easier than they should be.

Another game I shouldn't have purchased and is unpunched, although I did break the shrink wrap.

RATING: 6
My rating of "6" may seem unduly harsh, but it does have some fun and challenge, and I will be happy to play if in the right mood.

This is a random dungeon crawl, with an emphasis on "random."  It is true that some heroes and villains are vastly under/overpowered, there is more luck than strategy, the rule book is lacking, and that the game can go on longer than it should.

That said, I believe that one of the attributes of a dungeon crawl is precisely that it is random and a dice fest.

There was nothing in the rules that my good friend and I couldn't figure out and agree on.  We had a four-hour (!) two-player game and enjoyed every bit of it.  (I would hesitate to play with more than two.)  It came down to a nail-biting finale of who could raid the last crypt first.

If future experiences are anything like the first, I would be happy to play again.

I really want to like this game. It is Warlord in a board game.  But it is very luck dependent.

Strategy - Put your cards down at the beginning very smartly.  Put all your treasures in one tomb then go get it.

--Sept2008-- It's a dungeon crawl.  Not a terrible one, either.  Yet it seems to lack something.  I think, for example, that the (completely silly) Cutthroat Caverns was more fun.  (Some of the trouble, I think, is the lack of coherence about what it is that the players are attempting.  We found ourselves doing things that made no sense to the story of the game to advance some abstract score.  Consistently falling out of the game abstraction doesn't endear the game to me.)

This is a lite dungeon crawl that is heavy on information...  meaning, there id a tone of text to read and AP prone players will drag this game down to an unbearable experience.  I enjoy the characters and the combinations of items, spells and abilities.  I think the setup of the game is a bit involved and in turn we randomized the distribution of the 'tomb' cards.   I think a scenario or at least different goals for teams would be a pleasant addition.

RATING: 8.5
Tomb is dungeon crawling taken to a violent and vicious end.  During the setup of the game players take turns filling the tomb's crypt with treasure, traps, or monsters.  After the tomb is full players then add adventurers to the Inn (5 per player) and select one.  Then the game begins in earnest.  What a player can do depends on where they are: at the Inn they can recruit another adventurer until they have 5 in their party or they can draw cards, in the tomb they can move or attempt to pick the pockets of another party (thereby stealing their stuff) and at the door of a crypt they may decide  to raid it.  Make too many wrong choices and the other players may out distance you.

The real heart of the game are in the crypts.  Each card is worth points at the end of the game, so raiding crypts is what you want to be doing.  You must first pass any traps then kill all the monsters before you may claim the treasure.  However, you can either "bank" the treasure for points or use it and run the risk of losing the treasure if the adventurer using it dies in combat.  Combat is a dice fest; it is not unusual to be rolling a handful of dice.  Combat is furious and by no means easy.  Many adventurers will die each game.

While the game has a huge pool of adventurers available, only 5 per player are ever active in the game.  If an adventurer dies it is removed from the game and a new one is drawn from the pool and added to the Inn.  Players must carefully build their party from what is available, but any player not willing to see any of them die in combat will have a hard time earning enough points to compete.

RATING: 6
If you like lots of dice and a wild ride, then this is reasonably fun if the players enjoy this type of game. Seeding the board gives it a bit of strategy. Having players to the left or right play the monsters keeps players engaged when it's not their turn. Easy rules lure me to play it, because otherwise (with my personal interest in dungeon crawl games being low), I wouldn't bother. The advanced side of the board is the way to go.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Even when it doesn't seem to, I hope that we got the rules wrong when we played this game, since it looks like nearly broken, if not broken for good. The parties that enter the dungeon are never in real danger and they leave room after room with no rush and with their hair properly brushed, like if they would have been taking a walk in the park, and not disarming traps, killing a bunch of monsters and looting a lot of treasures. That's why the dungeon crawler spirit vanishes and the game turns into one of maximization of movements and luck of the draw.  Almost no other statistic than attack is used, and characters don't have to be a wizard or a cleric to attach spells or prayers to them, so there is no real use for those. Rogues can steal items from other prayers, but this ability is not used that much in the game neither.  The idea is nice, the components are pretty, the combat and recruitment systems are clever, but it seems deadly unbalanced in favor of the heroes, like if the game would have never been playtested before. I hope that [i]Cryptmaster[/i] have rescued these nice concepts, because they deserve to.

There was too much time spent counting and rolling dice (2 green, 3 blue, 1...no 2 red.  Oh, and I'm using this spell, so I add 3 blue and 2 green, but I have a modifier of -1 on all attack rolls)and it never really caught my interest.  

The artwork on the cards is very nice, the game plays quickly, but it was a bit too fiddly for my taste.

I played this 3 times at the Strategicon convention. My second play was with John Zinser & Jim of AEG.  It was cool playing with the designers.  I played a 5, 6 & 3 player game.  Don't over think the game as this isn't very stategic. But you do want to build your party wisely and equip them well.  There are some nasty monsters in this game.  After playing it I showed some others how to play and my advice to them was "Don't get attached to your characters,  they will die."  But you can recruit more.  Bottom line its just a lot of fun and there is player interaction with the person to your right or left acting as crypt master when you enter a tomb.  They get to try and kill your party.  What fun!

If your looking for comparison think of Runebound or Talisman but lighter and faster.  I can't wait for this to be released.

Fun (if slightly long) RPG-inspired romp. Players recruit a D&D style party and move into a dungeon to raid crypts. XP points are gained for disarming traps, beating monsters and finding treasure. Combat is simple: 3 different levels of combat dice are used according to stats. Hits are applied immediately (no defence) and combat is 'I go, you go'.

1st edition rules need plenty of work as there is much ambiguity. Print out the FAQ as you'll need it.

I played it once, but I think the game suffered for some analysis paralysis from the new players.  I think we also had too many players.  I would have loved this game many years ago as a more advanced version of the classic TSR game "Dungeon".  It also appears to be a quicker and simpler version of the game Descent.  The game might actually play best with 1-3 players.  Too much down time really seems to kill the fun in this game...

This game shares a problem with Age of Mythology: Most turns are very short, but when combat occurs, the game grinds to a halt for several minutes, and all players but the two involved have nothing to do. Also, why can't anyone do proper play testing? We must have had at least two dozens questions raised in our one game that should have been raised and solved in the first play test game.

RATING: 6
Lightweight dungeon encounter game.  You start by seeding the crypts within the catacombs with monsters, traps, and treasures.  Then you recruit characters from a pool in the inn, and trick them out with weaponry.  Then, you send them into the tomb to raid the various rooms for XP.  You generally want some disposable characters to sacrifice to monsters.  When your party is getting obliterated, you can flee to the inn to heal and recruit more adventurers.  The game is over when the tomb is cleared, and the winner is the player with the most XP.

Positives: Large number of encounters means that no two games will have the same monsters, traps, and treasures.  Overall, it's a unique, relatively streamlined way of meshing an RPG with a boardgame.

Negatives: Despite the excess encounter cards, every game will still be simply disarming traps and killing monsters in some combination, so it could easily become stale.  It plays much longer than the 60 minute box time, and doesn't require much strategy.  You basically want to have a big enough party to absorb some damage, and know when to flee.  There's not much player interaction, other than the race for the larger rooms and the ability to pickpocket other raiding parties.  The only truly annoying negative is excessive downtime as the game wears on.

Played a pick up game at GenCon 2008.  Not impressed.  Go in, kill the monster, get the treasure.  Seemed very easy to die and hard to come back from a death.   You can screw with other players, but that just drags out the game.  This is ok for an hour or so, but it just seemed to drag at the end.  Two players fought for the win, the rest of us just going through the motions.  There are much better games of this type around.

Tentative rating, based on an aborted play. The rules were...a little confusing.  It's badly in need of an FAQ (which it has, thankfully...but we didn't have access to it at the time).

Tomb is a surprisingly good dungeon crawl given its reasonable duration.  The interaction between the base characters and the abilities is slick, as is the memory component to mapping the crypts.  Tomb is not perfect; the colors are confusing, many of the cards are ambiguous, and the rules are notorious.  Find a teacher.

We've had a lot of fun with this. The rules are NOT user friendly, but it's a good game once you get your questions & house rules ironed out.

An interesting take on the dungeon crawler. This game relies a little too much on chance, for my taste. One player could enter a crypt and find nothing but treasure. Another player could find nothing but monsters. The worst part is, the player with the treasure gets XP for it. The monster player (if he survives) might get the same amount of XP. Where do my decisions come into play?

This game suffers from what I like to call: Candy-Landitis. A single card draw can send you all the way forward or all the way back.

Rules should be a bit clearer, as it is read it seems the best bet is to sit in the tavern and gather an unstoppable army.  When your first several turns are nothing but "Recruit from Tavern", it seems to be quite boring.

I liked this game on first play. Then a guy who is irregular in my gaming group bought it and insisted every couple of days that people play it with him. Some of us obliged for a while, and then we completely lost interest. Those few aspects I appreciated at first were quickly lost in an abyss of carelessness. In one game all the treasures got placed in one room and all the super monsters in another. One guy won, the other got smashed. Some fun, hey?

I'm really glad that I came back to Tomb and gave it another chance.  What at first seemed like a rather slow and cumbersome dungeon crawler has emerged as a brisk fun factor game laden with surprises and fun screw-your-neighbor antics.

The biggest difference in replay has been an increase in speed, and a familiarity with the mechanics.  I never would have suspected that a 5 man group at our game night could have busted this out in 90 minutes, but we made short work of the board and had a lot of fun doing it.

Rather chaotic, but a wonderful time burner that incorporates some clever strategies and the reward of much longer games into a tighter package.  It lacks some of the strong mechanics that signify my favorite games, but Tomb is fun.

Too much randomness in the cards. One moment can destroy your entire game. You can lose your entire party if you get the disintegration trap.

I like this game but it takes a really long time to play. While there is a ton of variety, once you learn the characters and items it is easy to build an unstoppable party.

RATING: 6
Alright....here is the scoop. There is heavy critiscism regarding the rules of this game. I myself, didn't find them that broken or confusing. If you just read the card as is, and don't put your own theory on what the card wants you to do then its an easy game to play....a really easy game to play! It does have some inexcusable mistakes, however. The game verbage was changed some time before the whole game was printed. Some parts of the game (board, rule book and some cards) refer to two decks of cards by a different name. This is really bad on the publishers part for making the customer swallow that mistake on a $50 dollar game! The game also advertises a 60 minute time for gameplay?! This couldn't be farther from the truth. It is more like a 2.5 to 3.5 hour game. Lastly, the game is not very difficult. By this I mean the Characters are a lot more powerful than all the monsters, and house rules are required to make the monsters have a fighting chance. I just never felt like the monsters might just win one fight. With all this said, it is a really fun game to play with your kids, or someone who doesn't like rule heavy games. It is extremely simple to learn and play. It is a game where you can socialize throughout, without periods of "contemplating". Hope this helps. It should be noted that I got this game at a huge discount and it is my opinion that this game is best enjoyed if you spend no more than $25 for it.

RATING: 6.5
It feels a little Munchkin-ish with all the overpowered stuff you get to do (I had the power to discard a card to summon a creature from another crypt over, which ended up moving a dragon all over the place), but somehow, all the overpoweredness actually balances out somehow. And besides, it's fast.

RATING: 6.5
Dungeon rompin' fun as you storm in and try to grab what treasure you can. Parties are 'disposable' which is a plus and a minus - they are simply a resource, and it can be quite funny to be slaughtered. However, there isn't any attachment to most of your characters. Overall, a fun and quick competitive dungeon crawl.

Revisited:
Once you give up trying to read the terribly written rule book and just look up on Youtube how to play... It's a really solid game.

Think "football manager" for fantasy/D&D heroes. Draft a team, lead them into the dungeon, try to come out on top!

RATING: 7.5
If you can get past the clunky as hell rule book (and download the extensive FAQ from AEG's website) you will be able to find a pretty good game hidden in here. The game itself looks awesome, and the competing teams of adventurers is a fun change from each person getting one adventurer only in other FRPG boardgames.

I haven't yet picked up the Cryptmaster expansion/extra base game which may mean that I have grown past this one - and in truth I haven't pulled it down from the shelf in over a year, which is unfortunate because I have had a lot of fun with this one. I need to play it again soon. (5/22/10)

RATING: 8
A fun game. Your enjoyment of it will suffer from too much downtime if you play with people who are slow to make decisions as there is a  lot of decision making on a turn. I think I would rather play with random seeding of the crypts than letting the players do it. This would also speed up the game a bit.

Tomb pits opponents against one another in a game of monsters, traps, treasures, and spells. Attempts to capture the dungeon crawl experience without hours of preparation. Assemble a crack squad of adventurers and enter the fabled Goldenaxe Catacombs in search of glory and hidden treasure. With Tomb’s unique set-up and character recruitment, you’ll never play the same game twice.

A fun dungeon crawl game that is vastly improved by its "expansion" (i.e. Tomb Cryptmaster).  Still, I would recommend the combination for all those who enjoy adventure games and are looking for a good multiplayer one to play with 3-4 people.

I want to love this game.  I think though that RPG board games are the worst designed board games, including this one.  It is such a simple game where the mechanics (especially the timing of cards) can get very confusing.

I think there is a great game in there, I just read the FAQ and want to give it a try again.

Played this twice at Strategicon over the Memorial Day weekend convention.  John Zinser brought the final production copy of the game, which is now being assembled.  John and Jim from AEG played the first time with us (6 players) and we played on our own the second (3 players).  Generally, the game feels like the classic Dungeon, but infinitely better.  The big warning - don't expect a strategic game here.  It's a fun social event; gathering treasure, killing monsters, playing a couple of screw you cards, and generally having a good time.  There are some nice card combos to discover, but largely, the game revolves around building up your characters and then whacking some monsters.  There is a fair bit of luck here - don't think otherwise.  Finally, despite the fact that the game plays up to 6 players, I'd stick with 3 or 4.  Like many dungeon crawl type games (e.g., Runebound), the game is a lot more engaging when you are involved in more of the action.

I'll definitely pick it up when it is available, as it is a game that scratches that monster-slaying itch without taking as long as Runebound or Descent.

Classic dungeon crawl dice roller on a modular board. Equip and level characters and spawn encounters. This game is showing its age versus the new stuff coming out especially with big downtime between player turns and too many rule exceptions. Fun in its day but the evolution of game design leaves this as a sentimental memory.

You have to treat this more as a race to get treasure than a pure dungeon crawl. Good with 3 but it does take a bit of time. Rules are horrible but for a beer and pretzels dice chucking fest it does its job.

RATING: 6
An interesting take on the dungeon crawl. Has a ton of character cards. You can have 5 characters in your party. Though only so many are available each game, you have to read a lot to get started. Game play is pretty simple. Stay in the tavern or move. In the tavern you recruit characters or draw cards.  Movement is toward a crypt or into a crypt. Once you enter, the player on your left or right plays the traps or monsters. If you win you get any treasure. Empty the tomb to end the game.

fun competitive dungeon crawl with some interesting characteristics not found in other crawls.  the system of choosing your party is brilliant... it forces strategic decisions right off the bat, such as whether to recruit the best characters immediately, or to head out for the easy treasures that you've placed in the '1' crypts.  there are some problems with the rules, mostly for card play, and the monsters using spells seems tacked on.  you tend to run out of characters about halfway through... which leads to a longer endgame because everyone is stuck with only 1 person in their party.

The rules for this game had to be revised. I obtained a PDF copy of the updated rules but then never tried the game again. I have watched a nice video play-through and now I understand it better. I will have to play this again soon. It's really just a dungeon crawl.

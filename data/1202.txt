Bought at the Origins 2008 auction.  I really enjoy Mystic Wood and have been looking for this game for quite some time.   Apparently my copy was owned by the CEO of Ral Pautha at one time.  The quote from Virgil on the cover of the rule book is great--I wish more games did this.   

A lot like Mystic Wood, but it takes up a ton of space.  I really enjoy the exploration aspect, though sometimes when the Sorcerer is in the first chamber it feels a little weird...that would be easy to fix, though.

Ah, nostalgia.  Played so much Mystic Wood growing up and found this in a package deal.  It's fun for what it is, but Mystic Wood still holds a play in my heart that this won't ever find its way into.

Great game with cards too big to play in any convenient space! Also, each player can control a search party so large that encountering any hostile stranger will result in death of said stranger.

RATING: 4
One of the earliest dungeon crawls.  Simple rules and quick turns minimise downtime.  However, the cheap artwork, characterless characters and stock encounters are significant negatives.  It is all over much too quickly with one set.  Three and the expansion is a reasonable number.

It's an oldie and a real classic -- but I don't think it's aged all that well, to be honest.  You can fairly quickly build a party which is kind of unassailable and then it's just a trawl for points.  All the challenge goes after that.

RATING: 8
While you stumble around on the floor, the ever-deepening dungeon starts to expand beyond your living room. Your party of heroes and witches has evolved into a coalition of friendly trolls and rescued prisoners. The Sorcerer is waiting for you somewhere in the labyrinth: do you call off the search and cash in your treasure or press on into the darkness?

This game shows its age, but if you are prepared to day-dream and go with the flow, it is the most open-ended and still the deepest darkest dungeon-crawl.

Un jeu extremement simple, qui pourrait servir comme introduction aux jeux de rôle classiques.

Absolute re-ludebla.

Very old, early entry into the dungeons and monsters game. The rules read like something from a bygone age and make me feel warm all over. I mixed three sets together so the game would snake off into other rooms of the house. Rating based mostly on nostalgia.

RATING: 5
A knee-aching dungeon bash where players lay out the dungeon using 4x3 inch cards.  So yes, it has to be played on the floor.  Stairways led to new levels that have to be begun elsewhere, so have a large house handy!  Fun romp.

The game plays almost as a combination of [GAMEID=7493] and [GAMEID=1370]. 

This could be easily re-fashioned with smaller tiles so that it becomes more practical: those tiles are huge, (even then you may still end up playing on the floor.)

Small pawns work very well. We are using Risk LOTR minis.

I picked up a copy of the original '78 set at a garage sale and I enjoy playing it. The only drawback is how much space it takes to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A light dungeon crawl which is less deadly than Dungeon Quest but of comparable low complexity. Decision scope especially in the basic friendly play is limited and gameplay lacks fine tuning. Some parties will grow so huge that any battle will easily be won, others will die repeatedly and the result of a single d6 can have huge consequences. Still, a fun experience when not taken seriously.
Various variants are possible. In friendly play you could restart your party, in competitive play rules are provided for attacking other players. Even Zombies can be added to the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Early card-based dungeon crawl. Quite random. Might benefit from a set of specific goals (e.g. kill a dragon, defeat the Sorcerer, rescue a victim from the Medusa). Only played using the designer's own computer version, which hides some game specifics regarding card distributions, combat, reaction, morale and scoring.

It's easy to look down on this simply designed and fairy misogynistic game - but hey, it was the 80s. Lay tiles to find your way through an unforgiving cave. You need a very large floor and friends who will endure being marooned because they got cocky. My friends moved to San Francisco and very time we visit they beg us to bring it. Good for those who aren't ashamed of their inner geek.

RATING: 5
Not at all bad as a dungeoncrawl game - just enough variety to stay interesting and make the basis of a decent narrative. Most of the tension and skill - such as it is - here come from balancing the need to collect as much good stuff as possible from the depths of the dungeon with the need to eventually return to the surface in order to score anything at all. The unusual "morale" mechanic whereby party members - whom you need to carry your booty out of the dungeon - get fed up and leave over time adds interest to this balance. Physical components are intensely annoying, with map tiles spreading out all over the place.

Liked Magic Wood, so thought I would give this one a try as well.  For 1 Euro, can't go too far wrong.  The game itself is very easy, plays very fast and is actually quite a bit of fun.  Less restrictive map than Magic Wood, takes up a lot of space so we play on the floor.  Good to play with kids.

Simple and luck based.  Still, a very cool idea for its time and great for young fantasy gamers as they watch their (often tragic) story unfold.  I had some fun with the little computer version too.  Desperately needs and deserves a reprint with smaller cave tiles, more cards, fresh artwork (although I like the artwork on the cards) and some simple luck mitigation additions (like the fate tokens in Talisman).  I wish Pete would reprint it!

Played this game a lot with my dad, much to my mom's chagrin. She'd come home from work and find the cave tiles spread all over the floor, and the chores not done. Yikes! We got in trouble a lot. 

Sorcerer's Cave is a fun game for young kids who like adventure and fantasy themes. Parents may use this game to introduce basic role playing concepts, such as character classes, inventory management, negotiation with NPCs, and killing monsters and taking their loot. 

Seriously, what better path could you choose to lure your kids into the world of roleplaying games? Sorcerer's cave is about the lightest pseudo RPG you could hope to find. Plus, you can always add your own monsters and items to the basic set. I recall the set had blank cards. 

Gameplay is simplicity itself: draw a tile, lay it down, encounter and defeat monsters with a few simple rolls of the die. Simple! Consider it RPG lite for kids too young for heavier games. 

Be warned however, this game takes up LOTS of space. You'll end up playing it on the floor. no doubt.

I never looked at this game (got it years ago) until I was checking it for purposes of trading it away (for Dibs, yay!).  Anyway, it appears to be a more D&D-ish, dungeoncrawly version of Mystic Wood (it's spinoff).  Avalon Hill cleaned up MW so that it could be played in a reasonable time, but there are a lot more adventures in this game and there are levels to the caverns, whereas MW is just on one plane--on top of the earth (well, with that whole other-side-of-the-board thing).

Fell in love with this game's slightly drab, classical aesthetic, which I still find very appealing today. A reissue should probably have smaller floor tiles and minis for the heroes, but no need to change anything else really. A solid dungeoncrawler, perhaps especially for solo play. Fun - frustrating when you keep falling down pit-traps and run out of tiles before you can work your way back to the exit, but no less fun for that.

Pretty Cool Dungeon Crawl.  I enjoyed it, but the only way I could affect the outcome of my game was to roll the dice well.  Hmmm.  The funniest joke is "Wow, you really are good at this game."

RATING: 6.2
Really fun game to play with younger people - my children when in their late single digits or early teens loved it but I can't imagine them playing it now.  The major problem this game has is in managing the dungeon layout and keeping track of which stair goes to which level.

We used to play on the floor in my parents living room with cards spread out all over the place ... It was an adventure !

I still prefer "Mystic Woods" which I would play at any time !

Another E-bay nostalgia effort.  I remember first playing this pre-teen, somewhere in the slippery slope that also had Choose Your Own Adventure, Fighting Fantasy, Talisman and eventually a whole lot of RPGs in it.

But only with friends who had large floors and understanding parents.  It's a small box, but a *big* game.

The "original" Dungeon boardgame. A work of quiet genius which is usually mistaken as simplistic or childish. Game designers should take note - a felt tipped pen, some dice and a pack of index cards are all that is needed to create your own fantasy game. Why has this not been brought up to date with 21st Century graphics. A crime!!!

The first game I played at my University wargaming/roleplaying club. Many years later, I bought a copy for myself. Aged and dated, it still has appeal, but takes up too much space, and the components have too little visual appeal (considering they DO take up so much space).

Could never get the hang of moving down levels, i.e. I would descend three set of stairs, round a few corners, and end up circling back to the top of the very same set of stairs!?

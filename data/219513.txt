Enjoyable tile laying puzzle game. Fits right into the rotation of Patchwork and Cottage Garden. Haven't fully decided which is best, they have their own place but its not necessary to have them all, though I will keep them all.

Similar to Patchwork. The game was very good. Regarding bear monument - there is lack of balance.  The rest of the game is very nice. The game is beautifull. I recommend this game for kids, because this game develop spacial sense. The game is quick and give a lot of fun - you want to game once again.

LIKE: More intense than I had thought! Lots of tetris-like configurations to think about. I also love how the tiles will deplete early, forcing players to improvise.

DISLIKE: It's light. Probably plays best at highest player counts. I wish it would play 5 or 6 players.

OVERALL: Good game for a filler or lighter night. It gets competitive, so don't let the "nature" of the game fool you! I think removing green tiles during setup would create an even tighter game.

Bärenpark is a family friendly two-dimensional jigsaw puzzle game that can be explained in just a few minutes. Place a tile and collect all bonus tiles from the spaces you covered, or pass and take a free tile. It is easy as that. Player interaction is limited to indirect blocking by snatching the tile your opponent want the most. The level of conflict felt appropriate for this type of a game. Rules are very robust with no obvious gaps and the game plays fast. 

Personally I absolutely recommend playing with the advanced rules right away because the special scoring rules will enhance the gameplay significantly (you select three random special scoring rules to be used in the game). I think that without the special scoring, working out the optimum way to play the game is too easy. With the specials in the play, you are forced away from your routines and the puzzle feel fresh. 

My only major complaint is about the box art. Don’t get me wrong, Klemens is a fine artist but he cannot draw humans. In Agricola his human figures were tolerable still, but today his work is plagued by something that just does not appeal to me. Cannot just put my finger on what it is exactly but the characters appear a bit clumsy, as if sculpted from clay in a haste. Thankfully, the bits and pieces do not share the art on the box, and the game actually is fully functional and pretty.

One more thing worth mentioning is that the setup takes a while, but not too long.

Neat game, similar to multiplayer Patchwork.  Since it isn't only 2-player, I feel it is a better game that isn't "solved" or made less fun by "best" strategies, but it isn't something I would need to own.

Also, koalas.  WHY!?

This game is a perfect fit as an introductory one. You just pick different type of Tetris-like tiles (such as in Patchwork) and try to cover a grid to build up a zoo with bears. It is easy to learn and fun to play although the analysis-paralysis factor can be a nuisance, but as usual that depends on the players.

Uma grata surpresa no catálogo da Ludofy. Um jogo que para quem jogou Patchwork e os outros que vieram com a mesma ideia de colocar peças de forma a montar um quebra cabeças dinâmico entenderá rapidamente este divertido jogo. Qualidade muito boa tanto nos comportes quanto no jogo em si. Ideal para jogar de maneira mais descontraída.

Great puzzle/game, light but gives you somethings to think about nonetheless. Pretty and easy to teach make it a great gateway option, you can even desconsider the suggestion to play with the goals in you first game and throw everything in on the first time. It's a bit of a hassle to store the parts in the box and I firmly believe the "insert" was a practical joke on us. :)

Think Patchwork - but simpler. This game is as light as they come, pleasant but not much in the way of interesting decisions. Most of the information is available on the table at the beginning of the game, so there's a big potential for AP for anyone inclined to work through optimal tile sequences. Its best qualities are that it's inoffensive and quick. Theme is almost nonexistent - during play, the artwork doesn't give much of a sense of anything, they may as well be generic coloured tiles.

RATING: 8
Tile laying game similar to cottage garden. The tile market is simplified and not determined by randomness, but by limiting your options based on your tile placement in your own park and decisions by other players. This, the absence of 2 seperate scoring tracks and a less circuitous end game makes this game much more elegant and also more approachable, while still offering enough interesting decision space for gamers. 

The race for the objectives, the variability of them and the fact that you're keeping your tiles to actually build up your park instead of discarding fields, make this game more exciting than cottage garden. For me this game took out the cumbersome parts of the latter and added more interesting elements. It removed cottage garden from my collection and it doesn't even include cat tokens.

Very good tile laying - puzzle like game. After few plays I like it much more, than Patchwork: it's definitely deeper and tensile, you really have to watch the other(s) and I also like the theme more, however this is really subjective. Plays really well with 2 players as well!  The games play very quick - for 2 players 20-30 minutes, with 4 players 40-60 minutes. I'm happy I've purchased it :)

Have yet to play with four players. Two is very good, and three is great.

This is an inspired design. I can't help but compare to Cottage Garden, and while I really appreciate the planning and thinkyness of that game, this one has a lot of planning and thinkyness too, and in altogether a simpler, more streamlined, less-clumsy, and more competitive game.

Though it would impact its simplicity, I wish the game could in some way reward you at the end of the game for a "good" bear park. I don't know, enclosures next to matching buildings, toilets next to food streets, something like that. The game's screaming for it, and the achievements don't really do that. I hope they can work something like this into the expansion, maybe a "gamer's ruleset" or something.

So placing tiles to fit into your tableau and scoring points is the new mechanic hotness.  Think Patchwerk, Odin's Ravens and Cottage Garden.  How many of them do you need?  I'm sticking with Patchwerk and calling it good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is what I was hoping Cottage Garden would be.  It's got the feel of Patchwork, but lighter.

Players take turns trying to fill their board Tetris-style.  As they cover icons they get tiles of the same type as the now-hidden icon.  So, part of the choice of placement is what tile you want next.

There are also end game goals that drive players to push towards either getting certain types of tiles or filling their board up in a certain way.  It's not Patchwork interaction, but it is interaction and gives a little room for dickishness.

Finally, there's decreasing points for filling each of your four boards.  So, earlier is better.

Definitely lighter than Patchwork, but very fun to play (and it goes up to 4 players).

What's not to like about a game called Bärenpark? Turns out quite a bit... While this game is somewhat reminiscent of Patchwork, it fails to deliver the same level of gameplay. The game needed a way to either more player interaction or player competition. I never felt like any of my decisions were meaningful. I've only gotten to play this as a two player game so maybe its missing. Maybe time will tell?

Very light, fun little tile placement game. I like the variable scoring options, and like the breeziness of gameplay: turns are quick, comboing actions can be very satisfying, and the game flies by so quickly that it's easy to play 2-3 times in a single sitting. I have not yet played Cottage Garden (or its Tetris-tile successors), but I like this enough that I don't feel any need to own any other games like this.

Solid gateway game with a great theme and may be my tetris piece game of choice besides Patchwork. Very simple to explain and plays pretty quick. Place a tile and get the bonuses from the spots you cover. First to complete 4 boards ends the game and you add up your points to determine the winner. There is also an advanced variant with different objectives that can add to your scores. The game takes a bit to setup and tear down since some tiles have to be stacked in numerical order, but the game is so smooth playing and in my mind doesn't outstay its welcome. I'd like to play it again with the objectives just to add a little more challenge, which I think the game needs if you are going to play it frequently.

Well-designed tile laying game. The cleverness of it revolves around planning ahead 2-3 pieces to use, and in making tradeoffs between the various point possibilities.

Not really all that impressive game of filling up areas Tetris-style. It makes me wonder if Uwe Rosenberg's Cottage Garden (or some earlier title, there are indeed a few) served as a blueprint... and then not just for designers, but also for publishers: [i]Look guys, the customers want to play Tetris. Anyone around who can make a game that will make [/i]us[i] money?[/i] The subject matter is incredibly silly, but I suppose it works as well as any other. Less excusable is the very limited way in which you can build up your own little world, as only overbuilding icons begets you new tiles. Usually you only have two, at most three tiles to select from. Because of how VP-awarding tiles are stacked up prior to the game's beginning, you really want to grab the valuable ones first; there is very little incentive to go off in a different direction. Also annoying is that your final score is difficult to predict in advance because of small differences between players which continue to add up over the course of the game. It isn't as bad as in, say, Russian Railroads or Die Macher or Hermagor (if you've ever heard of that title, that is)... but as a general rule I don't like it when a game 'works' like that. I prefer the cleaner mechanism present in Indian Summer, for example: simply finish your area, then see how may nuts you have left over. 

One thing in favour of Bärenpark is that it's a nice family game, I suppose. But overall I find the positive vibe surrounding this title a little over the top.

RATING: 8
More and more I`m being enthralled by games that have easy to understand 
and easy to explain rules. And at the same time offer a variety of small
logical and puzzely choices. This game delivers on all accounts. Much like
"Amerigo" I love the tetrisy  visual feel of the game.  Some of the bonus
cards to strive for are  difficult. (Looking at you double bear statues.)

Scores are tight and if played at a reasonable pace this game can give a mentally
challenging puzzle that gamers and non gamers can enjoy together. Can be played
aggressivly ,but most likely you`ll have enough problems to solve to even  care about screwing other players over.

In my mind, this is an easier version of 4 player patchwork. Players take turns drafting irregularly shaped tiles and then trying to fit them into a square. Unlike patchwork, you can select any piece that's available instead of one from the next three. Also, there are only positive points so open spaces don't count against you. It was a very light but interesting puzzle game that was fun to play. Owning Patchwork and playing a lot of 2 player games makes this a non-purchase. There is nothing in this game different enough to replace Patchwork.

RATING: 6
Does not replace Cottage Garden.  Here's why:  this game is a pain in the butt to set up.  Tons of pieces to sort, count, and filter.   There is a huge typo on the board for setup.   Lazy publisher has no intention to fix it until next printing.   It's correct in the rule book.   The game suffers a bit from AP, where Cottage Garden is the more breezy game.   Barenpark can move quick until the end when somebody must fill their board exactly and if there is a shortage of toilets this can be a problem,  if not impossible.   So, there are some annoying elements to this game.   Horrible insert, no baggies, etc.   The list goes on.   Is it fun?   Yeah.   It kind of is.    Does it have a long shelf life?   Probably not.   It does some things well and there is tension, so that's good.   A decent but not great poly-omino game.   Most people seem to prefer this over Cottage Garden, but I admire how casual that game is and this definitely isn't casual so it has its place.

This is a polyomino game in the vein of Cottage Garden and Patchwork. Each player starts with a landscape tile with various icons. You place a poyomino on the landscape tile to cover icons and acquire new polyominoes to your supply to be played in future rounds. Some of the polyominoes are worth points and if they're in a stack, the points descend as their acquired. Some of the icons will allow you to add a new landscape tile adjacent to your starter. You can have 4 landscapes at most. When you complete a board, you'll get a point tile from a stack that descends. Unless playing with families/children, always play with the expert variant with goals. Everything in this game is a race to get points and efficiently fitting everything into your park. I don't find it as good as Patchwork, but Barenpark is worth having in your collection due to Patchwork only being able to accommodate 2 players. I haven't played Cottage Garden, but I think the consensus is that this is better. This is also cheaper than Cottage Garden and comes in a smaller box. Definitely worth trying. 

Please note: The first edition has a misprint on the supply board. Though, it is correct in the rulebook. The insert is more terrible than most and there can be an issue with 4 players where none of the players can finish their boards leading to people having to houserule the game ending or trying to find some other way to end the game:

RATING: 7
Barenpark, despite being yet another poly-omino game in the wake of Patchwork, manages to set itself apart by introducing new pieces to the mold. Most importantly the addition of objectives and statues establish the game as a series of races. Properly prioritizing these races along with the smooth building of your park is key. Since the objectives, statues, and tiles themselves each offer points, players must assess which to prioritize each turn. Additionally, the boards themselves grant players access to new tiles, which injects planning into this racing element. Choosing to place a tile inefficiently, to secure a key tile or objective, must be weighed against the risk on not completing the tile as quickly. This give and take is the heart of Barenpark. The various objectives provide a decent deal of replayability. I wish there were ways to lay multiple tiles on a turn to create the possibility of swingy combos, but as it stands it is still quite fun, lightning quick, and highly recommended lighter-fare.

A competitive puzzle solving tile placement race game themed around constructing a bear park. In a 2 player game the first player starts off with 1 toilet and the second player 1 playground. You use these to cover icons on your individual player boards that give you ether a green area for 0 points, an animal house which is worth more the earlier you take it, or a new board to expand your park. You use these to cover even more icons with the goal of filling up your board. Once your park is expanded you also have access to animal enclosures which come in different configurations and are also worth points. Each of the boards that you complete earns you a bear statue which again, are worth more points if you take them sooner rather than later. The first person to complete their 4 board maximum triggers the game end and the other player gets a final turn. There is also the option to play the Expert variant where there are 10 sets of objective tiles available, you choose 3 to put in play, and they give you additional points for completing the objectives. To date we have played 5x Basic and 4x Expert games.

For what is supposedly a race game this has a surprising lack of tension. I always felt like I could do what I needed without too much pressure, or maybe it was that I just didn't care about the outcome either way. There was a bit of competition for the animal houses, but the animal enclosures are such a wide variety of shapes that you were rarely in competition for those and it was more about checking to see what was available that fitted in with the layout of your own park. Even the stack of green areas always had something remaining at game end. Maybe we should remove [i]even more[/i] pieces from the 2 player game than is suggested. I somehow feel that the mechanisms are at odds with each other. On the one hand I'm trying to work out a puzzle of the best way to place my shapes for maximum benefits which in itself can be quite tricky, then I have to think about grabbing the higher point pieces first and some of them don't even work with my layout so I have to get to my optimums before anybody else or settle, then I have to collect bear statues (sometimes 2 on a turn!)...whew! It's a totally different feeling from something like Qin where you are just plopping down tiles and pagodas in a mad frenzy trying to poach villages from each other etc.

This led to me feeling that it was one of the dullest, blandest, most generic tile placement games I've played and fits right in there with Alhambra, Carcassonne, Cacao and Palazzo in my book. Forgettable. It is also one of the games I like least in the list of polyominoes games I've played keeping company at the bottom with New York 1901 (another bland generic feeling kind of game). That list is currently topped by Blokus Duo and NMBR9 with Patchwork and Cottage Garden close behind. I find the Expert variant to be [i]slightly[/i] more interesting but my gaming partner doesn't think it adds anything to his gaming experience so he prefers the Basic version. In either case, both of us could take it or leave it.

Its nice enough, but there is zero player interaction, and the theme is redundant....all three other players immediately asked why bears? Why not slap a Jurassic park license on it and be creating a dino park?

Gameplay is quick but actually not all that rewarding. It needs something to make it 'pop' something....like the secret job boards from zooloretto, or simply dishing out 1-2 secret objectives to each player rather than the completely open information of the current game...or maybe a penalty for left over tiles at the end

Sold in 2017.

I'm glad I picked this one up on a whim. I was interested in getting one of these light games that are all about fitting tiles together (Cottage Garden, Castles of Mad King Ludwig), and the theme made this the winner. I'm not necessarily into bear parks, but I certainly like bears. 

Super easy to teach, play is fast (but has potential for serious AP problems), and there are so many objectives to race for that there is constant tension. I prefer 3P-4P because the tile quantities place more constraints on players, making each decision a bit more important.

A beautiful and easy game that is played in 20 minutes. It is streamlined and well designed. With simple and good rules that can be taught in a few minutes. 

Place a tile and get the things you place your tile upon. That is a great mechanism. But the things you get in this game are only more tiles and boards to place them on. And you can only ever place a tile on your turn. Bigger is almost always better and what you place them on does not really matter once you have a few tiles in your storage. 

There is a puzzling aspect of the game as you want to fill up the board but are not allowed to place on wells. It is a good mechanism but it is quite easy to find the best option. 

It is a race to fill up boards to get the highest points for filling them up and there are goals that are random for the game that give a bonus when you complete them. The first to complete goals get the most points. That gives variety to the game, but it still feels to easy and solvable to be really interesting for me. Could be good to play with kids, but for gamers this game is too simple.

Quick tile laying family game where there is very little player interaction or need to look up from your player board. Cover over an area with a symbol and take a tile matching that symbol from the pool. Keep doing this until a player has covered four boards completely. Bonuses for completing a board and for fulfilling certain public goals. 

I don't need to play it again but it'd make a great one to pull out with non-gamers.

Excellent game. Bärenpark takes the main concept from Patchwork but reworks it in a number of interesting ways. All the pieces are technically available from the start, being unlocked every time you build on top of specific icons. You can choose to expand the park in different directions, and every time you fill one of your tiles you get a bear statue of decreasing value.
Once you've learned how to play, check out the Achievements variant! It makes the game more tense, and the choices more interesting.

Barenpark is a polyomino tile laying game. Explained in moments with deep strategy, Barenpark is an excellent implementation of this style of puzzle game. Depending on where you place a tile determines the next tile you will be able to place. Combine this with thoughtfully simple goals to reach during the game, Barenpark is a winner.

RATING: 6
Decent game with "Tetris" tiles. You start with one tile to place in your park, and you acquire more by covering marked spots. The only interaction is by getting tiles your opponents want, but this usually happens by chance, as everyone just focuses on their own park. I played the basic game, which is, indeed, very basic: most tiles give victory points and you just total them at the end. Playing with achievements should spice things up, but doubtfully enough to change my opinion on the game very much.

Now, about that box insert... Seriously, what the hell were they thinking?

RATING: 7
Barenpark is a puzzly, tile-laying game with a far more depth than it appears on first blush. Yes, it's tile-laying on individual player boards, which usually means "little to no player interaction" or "multi-player solitaire." But there are tweaks here that makes for a sneakily deeper experience with plenty of passive confrontation and competition. Don't let the gorgeous artwork by Klemens Franz or the cuddly, family-friendly goal  (to build the best bear-themed park) fool you!

Players lay Patchwork-like orthogonal tiles on their individual player boards to build the best Bear-themed park. Each player starts with one 4x4 square park board, and can add up to three more during the game to expand their park. Each turn, one tile can be laid on your player board and must connect orthogonally to a previously laid tile on the board. No part of a tile can jut beyond the parameters of the player board tiles, and no tiles can overlap or stack with other placed tiles. 

During tile placement one will be able to cover various squares on each board that contain symbols: a green wheelbarrow, a white cement mixer truck, an orange steam shovel, or a crew of construction workers. These symbols are in different placements on each player board tile. New tiles are rewarded when/if your tile covers one or more of these symbol spaces during one of your tile placements in the following ways:

Green wheelbarrow spaces (two per player board tile): choose from a selection of four different green park tile shapes, which are worth no points in and of themselves: one-square toilets, two-square rectangular playgrounds, three-square rectangular food stalls, and three-square, L-shaped river tiles. These pieces are the most plentiful in the game and are usually the "glue" type pieces needed to completely cover a singular player board tile. 

White cement mixer spaces (two per player board tile): choose from one of (4) differently shaped tile pieces, each shape corresponding to a different breed of bear (panda, gobi, koala, polar). Depending on player count there are equal stacks of each type that score in descending order. So claiming the first panda tile from the stack will be worth 7 victory points; claiming the second is worth 6, and so on. These tiles are numbered to identify their VP value. [White cement mixers also give you the option to take from the lower-tiered green park tiles].

Orange steam shovel spaces (one per player board tile): choose from 12 singular and uniquely shaped 5-square tiles (think "the longer or zig-zaggier fancy shapes from Patchwork"), with three each corresponding to a different bear type (panda, gobi, koala, polar) as above. These vary in VP between 6-9 points when placed. These valuable and one-of-a-kind pieces are also the trickiest to fit into your park. [Orange steam shovels also give you the option to take from the lower-tiered white cement mixer or green park tiles].

Construction crew (one per player board tile): when covered, players can expand by taking a new 4x4 player board tile from the stack and connecting it orthogonally to their existing park boards. Players are limited to no more than four total park boards per park (including the starting board).

Each player board tile also has one square that cannot be covered by a standard tile. This 1x1 square is a pit and can only be filled by a bear statue, which can only be obtained once the 15 other squares on the player board have been covered with tiles. There are 16 bear statue tiles in the game numbered #1-16 VP, and if you qualify for a bear statue tile, you take the highest value numbered tile remaining to fill in your pit square. 

Players take turns until one player has filled in 64 squares across four player board tiles in their parks (15 squares per tile + one bear statue awarded for filling each of these completely). After the round is finished allowing for equal turns per player, all points from VP tiles on your park boards are tallied, as well as the points on your bear statues (if any). Your uncovered squares on your player boards and your unplayed tiles do not count for points (i.e. you are not penalized with negative points for this either). 

The "advanced rules" introduces ten different in-game scoring rewards, of which three are randomly selected each game. Each scoring condition includes three VP tiles of descending values per type, and are claimed if a player activates a particular scoring condition. Examples include "first to place three polar/koala/gobi/panda bear tiles," or "first to place three connected river park tiles." This "advanced" addition doesn't add more time nor complicate the gameplay, so I suggest playing with these optional tiles immediately in your games. 

Folks that are familiar with the tile-laying confines of Carcassonne, Patchwork, etc. may think "nothing to see here." But this game will surprise you because it's not as straightforward as all that, and certainly not as intuitive to someone used to other tile-layers namely, the Bärenpark tile economy makes the game more strategic, introduces more agonizing choices, and introduces more direct "indirect" player interaction.

All tiles in Bärenpark are public. As are all player boards. And these tiles are finite (and in the case of the orange backhoe 12 5-square tiles, wholly unique). You can see what's left, what's dwindling, and what's gone. And you can also see who may need what piece to fit into their boards next. 

Bärenpark has open and perfect information that can be planned for, unlike Carcassonne (face down draws) and Patchwork (randomized starting tile layout as you wheel around the inventory). 

The other aspect that differs from other tile-layers is how tiles are acquired. Essentially, you decide when you want to take a tile, and what kind of tile - or tiles - you wish to acquire. Tiles are rewarded if and when you place a tile over the various symbols. So larger tiles may cover multiple symbols at once, granting you multiple tiles to take (essentially steal) from other players. 

This game is tenser, with more frisson, because while you control when you can claim certain types of tiles, you are restricted by how many of each you may acquire in Bärenpark. There are only (4) possible opportunities to gain a high-value orange tile, and only (8) possible chances to gain white tiles. So you want to make your plays count when you do decide to cover the spaces on your park to acquire them - and also make sure they will fit in your player board after you do!

Bärenpark is imbued with a far greater sense of urgency while playing. Tiles decrease in value as they are taken from the supply and golden bears decrease in value as players fill their player boards. So the game has you racing to acquire tiles for points as fast as possible. While also trying to reconcile these higher scoring tiles on your board in legal ways, and in ways that don't limit your builds in future turns. 

Add to this the replayability of the game due to the variable, double sided player board tiles, and the 10 in-game victory conditions randomly selected each game, and it's clear there is far more game in Bärenpark than may initially be expected. 

Bärenpark is a dynamite game for 2-4 players that plays fast and tight and tense, and scales well for 2-3-4 players. It is tactical and puzzly and there is usually too many things you want to do per turn, which leads to some agonizing and also thrilling plays. And the end result is pleasing (like many tile-layers), when you have a full grid of colorful tiles arranged on your park boards, even if your civic planning was less-than-optimal. I highly recommend it for fans of the genre - and especially to those who think that the tile-layer genre is all played out.

An overall solitaire puzzle game where you are placing tetris-shaped pieces into your tableau to expand and obtain more pieces to use in future turns. You can only place one piece on your turn from your supply. If you planned poorly and don't have any pieces, your whole turn is getting a generic piece.
The multiplayer part is trying to beat other players to the milestones which score points. Accomplishing the scoring objective(s) first will net you the most points, which is pretty key to winning.

Barenpark is very similar to Patchwork and Cottage Garden. I always thought that the two are family games that don't really appeal to the younger players with its more serious theme - patching and planting. This one does with its animal theme and cutesy components. It doesn't feel as tight as Patchwork and certainly allows more flexibility to develop your "park" board. Don't think I'll hold on to this game. Having Patchwork is enough for my collection.

It's a tetris puzzle sort of game, but with an added element of racing toward a few different goals, all of which reward a few points more for finishing first. But then after one player finishes the whole park, everyone else gets one last turn, which felt really bizarre to me. But anyway, I like the way you're covering spots to get more tiles and boards, and the puzzle is fun, but ultimately it's just not my kind of game. I'm only going to be so excited by just playing a tetris puzzle.

Initially a 7, but I upped my impressions after playing with the 'goals'. They really add a lot to the game. Great, easy to grok tile laying game, much better than cottage garden, but not as clever as Patchwork. Still, works great as a 4 player game.

Bärenpark was aptly introduced to me as an alternative to Cottage Garden. The complexity is comparable, Bärenpark feels more compact and plays a bit quicker while the sedate quality of Cottage Garden is lacking.

The goal again is to complete boards. Points are scored depending on the order of board and task completion. The bigger tiles score points as well. Contrary to Cottage Garden, all tiles are available. The challenge is to decide which goal to pursue first while Cottage Garden is about making the best out of a limited set of option. I stay with Cottage Garden but I can understand why others will prefer Bärenpark.

Very fast playing Tetris. Even though you are filling your own board you have to pay a lot of attention to what others are doing all the time. Reminds me a bit of Alhambra and Suburbia. Special scoring themes change the arc of the game between plays, but so far I'm doubtful of long term replayability due to the fixed set of tiles.

A Tetris-like game centered on racing for better tiles and objectives. I love how covering icons quickly to get good, high-value tiles, forces you to fill your board unoptimally, which creates a large part of the tension in the game.

This game is fast and quite fun. You are always involved and the turns are super quick. You constantly think about which tile really fits best to your park and chase those. Expanding early is good because now you have more options and you can get more valuable tiles. What a simple and great game. Cannot appreciate more.

Great light tile-laying game that features polyomino elements that you piece together to build a theme park. It's a very pleasant game and has gone over very well each time I've broken it out. You really need to play with the goal tiles because it adds a bit more player interaction. Looking forward to see what the expansion brings this year.

RATING: 6
I am predisposed to like this game based on the theme alone. Who would want an entire zoo when you could have a bear park instead and ditch the rest of the stupid animal kingdom?! 

Bärenpark is a nice little tetris-like puzzle. The planning placement can be interesting, but the pace is a bit awkward. The game would almost be better played with a time restraint, as each placement itself doesn't ask too much of your strategic and mental muscle. But outside of actual placement, there is just enough to do that it slows you down. Then, as you are left waiting for your next turn, you find yourself with enough time to be mapping out several moves in advance. 

I'd recommend playing this game at a quick pace. As soon as someone decides on their placement, allow the turn to pass to the next player, while the previous player is finishing up drafting their tiles. 

Would be nice for there to be more opportunities for players to interfere with one another or maybe even cooperate. Outside of your opponents grabbing one of the tiles you were interested, you are mostly playing your own game. 

Decent game, but just a bit too simple for me to be excited about playing again.

RATING: 5
Dull. That is the only word that comes to mind. Place various shaped pieces onto your board covering icons to collect other pieces to place on your board. That is it, there are points for completing boards and for getting sets but as there is no real skill other than selecting the correct piece to cover your icons and remembering that there are goals to achieve the points usually go to the first player. It may work for younger players but for adults this is dull with no challenge, for a similar game with skill I would play Cottage Garden every time.
Update - played it 3 player at the club the other night, completed my board with no difficulties and no holes. To me the game was no challenge - verdict - still dull.

This is a game, which Cottage Garden wanted to be. Bärenpark is lightweight tile laying game which works smoothly and is played in 20 minutes. Scoring is streight-forward and expert versions brings "missions" -> more variety for different plays. Patchwork's/Cottage Garden's tile choosing mechanism is missing here, but Bärenpark doesn't even need it. Good game and choice for the times when you want to play some tetris game with 3-4 players. Still, I think there is a room for the REAL Patchwork experience for 3-4 players...

The best multiplayer light tile laying game out there at the time of this writing.  It's quick, it's smart, there's some interaction / competition with the objectives, I like it.  For 2 players, play patchwork.  Otherwise, this puts cottage garden & indian summer to shame.  If you want very heavy & hardcore tile laying, look at Feast for Odin, but it's really in a different category altogether.  It's also family friendly and accessible while offering enough to convince hardcores to play it.  The errata on the board is a shame, make sure you take note.  But otherwise, well done.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

May be a Cottage Garden killer. The games are a bit different but with some similar concepts. This one is spatial fun puzzling out what pieces are needed, etc. I do like how you can patch across the different boards instead of having to stick to one board. I'd play with achievements straight away as well. Note there is an error on the supply board for the number of green pieces.

Interesting Tetris-style game. I like the different challenges offered: the bonuses, the decisions you have to make about what to cover up to get additional tiles, the fact that there are four boards to fill. Lots more going on compared to Cottage Garden, although I enjoyed the art of Cottage Garden. Barenpark is just "thinkier" with more layers of strategy.

Great tile puzzle game. The game is so balanced that it usually feels like anyone could end up winning. Counting the points at the end is always a lot of fun because it is usually super close! This is a very simple game with little downtime and plays under an hour with four! This should be a big hit for anyone who loves Tetris.

I played a basic game, and my rating is slightly speculative of what the game would be in the "expert" version. If I had rated the basic game as is, this would be a 4. This is because not only is this game's mechanisms completely tangential to its theme, but also it is much too easy to fit tiles into your grid, creating no sense of tension. There is a race to get certain tiles before other players, but usually it only costs you a point or 2 if you mess up (which matters but the game makes it feel like it doesn't matter cause the scores are so inflated), and if they take the unique tile you want since it is so easy to find space to place tiles it is no problem: just choose a different unique tile and adjust slightly. I'd expect the achievements in expert mode makes the tile placement decisions harder, which is why I think it would make the game better. Even the though I think I'd much, much rather play Patchwork as my quick and light tile placement game, as not only is tile placing more agonizing but he pieces have more cool shapes, the theme is better evoked even if the theme is less cool, and both the market and time track mechanisms are pretty cool.

Well the idea "each players builds something Ubongo-ish, while taking the tiles from common pool" is quite frequently visited lately.
We've had Patchwork (which remains the best, but only accomodates two players), we've had Cottage Garden, we've had Steam Park.
BearPark has the problem of being published later than those games, but is superior to Cottage Garden (closely) and Steam Park (by far). Why? It's far more streamlined, less things to remember, more puzzly action, faster pace, more intuitive in terms of pretty much everything. Don't be repulsed by the uglyish box, BearPark is the perfect territory-building family game.

Simple, fun tile-laying game. Thinking ahead to your selection of available tiles is needed, but it won’t burn your brain.

This has replaced "Patchwork" for me.  The game looks big, but it is a deceptively simple filler.  As such, it plays really quickly and never outstays its welcome.  I think a currency system (like "Suburbia") would have made tile earning a little more weighty than simply covering up an icon, and the arbitrary nature of turn order can give undue advantage to some players.  One caveat: ALWAYS play with the achievement tiles.  They are not that hard to integrate, and they really speed up playtime by narrowing the focus of goals and objectives.  The components are excellent, but the "insert" is horrible.

Nice basic idea. A race to efficiently fill up eventually 4 square boards (you start with one and acquire the rest later) with polyominoes from a common stock. Various sets (different colored polyominoes...) and alignments score points, as well as a completed board. You need to watch what is left available, you need to watch what your opponent is up to and plan your own actions, which is difficult to do. Somehow I did not enjoy this as much, because it seems a little chaotic, There are only one of each pentominoes, and even though there are many triominoes in the game they can also run out and make it impossible to fill holes on you board. The playing time a little bit longer than I think this game merits for.

[b]Barenpark[/b] was sold via the marketplace 1/30/18.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8/10):[/COLOR]

[i]I am a huge fan of spacial puzzles and I've really enjoyed Patchwork, unfortunately my kids don't like it nearly as much as I do. We tried Cottage Garden and while my older daughter liked it I really didn't enjoy how compressed the boards were [i](they could typically be filled in with less than 6 pieces)[/i]. Then along came Barenpark which has a theme my girls love, according to them it doesn't get better than polar and panda bears, and is designed by Phil Walker-Harding who's been on quite a roll designing excellent family games.

In short Barenpark offers a similar Tetris style puzzle to solve as Patchwork, but instead of choosing tiles from a path you collect new tiles based on the symbols you cover up in your park and everyone is racing to be the first to finish building their park. There are different types of tiles, the larger the tile the less of them you can get over the course of the game. You can also expand your park as you play and collect bonus tiles as you completely fill in each board. While not difficult, you are definitely rewarded for planning ahead and paying attention to your opponents. This is especially true if you play with the optional achievement tiles which immediately reward the player who finishes them with additional points. The artwork is charming and perfect for the theme, the tiles are nice and thick and the rules are clearly laid out and it's easy to teach. 

Patchwork is still my personal favorite Tetris style game because I love the tension created from having to balance time versus button income when selecting tiles. Barenpark offers a very fun challenge to solve that is a blast to play with my kids and definitely offers a different play experience than Patchwork. I'm happy to have both of these games in my collection.[/i]

This game asks the inevitable question of how much can a koala bear. The core of the game is the decision on where to place your tile on your board - for the spaces it covers dictate what types of tiles you add to your personal store for placing on future turns. It’s clever in its simplicity. While pleasant to play, my fear is that the game at heart is too simple - get and place the biggest (and highest scoring) tiles as fast as you can, because they'll cover more spaces more quickly, getting you more big tiles for future turns as well as filling your boards more quickly (for other points). And then backfill the bare spaces as required with smaller pieces. My other fear is that analysis paralysis is lurking around the corner for the competitive beasts - there are lots of shapes and lots of potential configurations and the game is all about point maximisation in the minimum number of turns. If you have trouble configuring your Princes of Florence board, this is 4 times worse! Otherwise, bear with it, the game is dead easy to teach and play, and the components are nice to play with. It could easily find success in a family setting if they're happy to play at a normal non-optimisation pace, and that has much merit.

2 Plays - Quite a fun game. Essentially you're laying different shaped tiles onto a board, which essentially amounts to a variation on Tetris. The twist is that covering up icons on the board allows you to take particular tiles from a market, which you can then use later on. As you might have guessed, you will need to get tiles from the market area that match the available space left on the board, as you will be rewarded for efficiently filling your board(s) (you expand your 'bear park as you go). The final thing that brings the game together, is that the market tiles are kept in stacks, with the tile at the top being worth them most points. so it creates a "first in, best dressed" situation. This adds to some interesting decisions as you race for rarer/ better point value tiles, but also the ones that best fit your park space. It all comes together very well - it's not ground breaking, but it is fun and simple to teach!

Bärenpark is a light tile-laying game where players are trying to fill up their boards with tetris-style pieces, covering up icons that give them more pieces to place. Almost every source of points in the game is worth decreasing amounts of points the later it is taken, from the medium-sized tiles to the statues for completing boards to the goals earned by placing tiles in certain configurations. This keeps the tension in the game high. However, in addition to trying to compete for these points, players have to make sure always to have at least one tile queued lest they lose a turn. This game really exercises the brain trying to puzzle out which tiles will go where, often a few turns into the future. While it's definitely not heavy fare, I really like the thought that this game requires.

Good game. Maybe a little too light. First two player game ended in an almost ex aequo. The strategy or tactics are only there by taking tiles before your opponent. Good and elegant, no must have. Might be more exciting with three or four players.

RATING: 7
Smooth combination of tile laying and planning. Choices are not overwhelming, since you only have one action and limited options, but it offers surprising depth, because you have to plan some turns ahead. Aside from the first come first serve principle, there's no player interaction. The strategy for the base game gets repetitive, but I haven't played with the bonus tiles yet (that might change the game quite a bit, I hope).

Barkenpark is a light game where players are laying tetris style tiles onto their player boards. When they cover symbols, they get to take more tiles from a central display into their personal supply. The tiles have decreasing point values as their piles get depleted, and there is a point reward for completing filling one of your tiles. The replayability is supposed to come from these three achievement goals, which also have a decreasing value as players achieve them. It was a nice, quick, light game. The high impedance on being firsties bothered me some, but in a game this short it wasn't too too troublesome.

And more Tetris pieces. This one is most similar to Cottage Garden and Patchwork, with each player acquiring pieces from a common area to accommodate in their individual board. Phil Walker-Harding really knows how to make a smooth-playing game and I liked Barenpark much more than the fiddly Cottage Garden. But with that smoothness can come a feeling of too much balance. It's hard to see how players will ever end up far apart in scoring, unlike in the superior Patchwork.

Impressed with Barenpark as is usual with this designer's games. He really seems to be on fire lately with making games with simple accessible rules, a bit of depth, and just flat out fun levels of interaction. 

Barenpark isn't super deep, but it offers interesting decisions at every turn. There's not tons of player competition or interaction, but the quicker you grab certain structures and fill in your board, the quicker you'll get those higher point tiles and be closer to victory. 

I also really quite enjoy Uwe's tile laying games of Patchwork and particularly A Feast for Odin, so I'm glad to see another design using these ideas. Looking forward to more plays of this.

A bit of a brain burner in a tight package.  Will be compared to other tetris style games like Patchwork.  Vastly different than patchwork but both are great in there own way.  The achievement tiles really make the game as it gives you direction and conflict with your opponents.  Patchwork is a time management / block your opponent tile  placement game.  Baren Park is a expand your area and optimize that area with the pieces you get  but there isn't as heavy a defensive aspect.  Not to say there isn't defense.  Great game that plays quick but has thoughtful decisions each turn.

Very good tile-laying game. Perfect for a casual, lightweight, peaceful mood; and the achievements/placements provide enough strategic choice for the game to be interesting.

In a 1v1 setting, Patchwork provides a more competitive and exciting experience, but the cutthroat nature of Patchwork means it only works well when you're in the mood - Barenpark allows you to skip that and peacefully build the best bear park you can.

Very nice, satisfying, good game for 2-4 players (my wife loves it!!), with very good production quality for the price. Many people compare it to "Patchwork" (another game that my wife and me love), although in my opinion Uwe Rosenberg´s game still is better than this "Bärenpark". Both have very simple rules (although playing well is another story...). Advanced mode of "Bärenpark" (adding target tiles), I like a lot, and we always play it this way. I don´t know ... I would say that "Patchwork" is prettier, a perfect game for two players, it´s a beautiful puzzle-tetris-race-management game. And "Bärenpark" is a pure puzzle-tetris-race-game, in which it could seem (at first sight) that there´s no interaction between players, but you´ll have to be very alert to see what others players do in their turns if you don´t want to be behind in victory points, and think ahead about your three-four future moves. I´ve both games, and I´m very happy because both cover different leisure moments, we enjoy both a lot!, and both are very good if you like this kind of board games.

Wifey approved.

One of my picks from a recent visit to he wonderful Spirit Games in Burton. Wifey was a little dubious to begin with, but after about three turns was absolutly loving it. so much so that we immediately played another game.

It really is quite a simple take on the Patchwork/Cottage Garden type spacial awareness game. Far easy to play and explain, with no button currency to worry about, or cats! Just lay a tile onto your board and if it covers one of four icons, then follow the simple instructions (either take another tile or an expansion board). 

Point scoring is easy to follow and so the 2P games played have been enjoyable and quick. Will see if this is the same reaction at higher player counts.

A tetriszezés mostanában úgy tűnik nagyon népszerű a játékfejlesztők körében. A Medvepark  a Patchwork és Cottage Garden után sok újat nem tud mutatni. Annyi újdonság van benne, hogy a üres területeken különböző szimbólumok letakarásával mi döntjük el milyen következő beépítendő elemekhez jussunk és mikor bővüljün a parkunk. Pontok a nagyobb elemeken szerepelnek, amelyek ha beépítésre kerülnek hozzák a játék végén a rájuk írt pontokat. A játék nehézsében sem tér el nagyon a fent említett két elődtől, időben sem hosszú.
Nem az én világom a tetriszes társasjátékok, amit a játékra adott pontom is tükröz. Aki szereti a fenti két elődöt, ebben sem fog csalódni.

Neat game in the Cottage Garden family (but different designer, of course): draft puzzle pieces from a communal pool, fill up your own boards as quickly as possible. There are several differences, of course, but you still get that similar feel. 3 random bonus types are chosen each game so incentives will be slightly different. You get those puzzle pieces by covering specific icons on your boards, and you can only play pieces orthogonally connected to one another: so you have to do some advance planning to maximize efficiency.

Fun little family-weight game! I don't need to own it, but wouldn't mind playing it if someone else wanted to.

This is a game of Tetris where you build a park for bears.  Each round players place one of the pieces in their stock on their personal park boards and based on the spaces they cover get to choose new tiles to place on future turns.  Some of these pieces score points but the real points are scored by filling the entire board except for one space where you will then get to put a bear statue for a large point gain.  The earlier to get to these the more points they are worth.

I've found that when games have such stringent and limited scoring opportunities the scores end up being very close or a player who makes a mistake or unoptimized decision loses the game early with no real way of catching up.  This makes for a very unsatisfying competitive experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.3
This is a tetris like tile laying game. The theme is cute, a bear park (koalas, polar bears etc). Each round you lay a tile down on your board and depending on what symbol you cover up determines what tile you can select for the next round. I recommend playing with the achievements as it adds a little more variety to the game. Overall it is an okay game, just too light for me. I could see this being great for family as it is quick and easy to learn.

Patchwork comparison:
I prefer Patchwork because the majority of the tiles in patchwork are rather oddly shaped, where as in this game the majority of the tiles tend to be rectangles, which does not make the game as challenaging. The one drawback to Patchwork is that it is 2 player only whereas Barenpark is 2-4.

Note: Have not played Cottage Garden.

Good, puzzle-like tile-placement. Laying out the perfect grid isn't that difficult once you get the hang of the game flow, but your perfect plans aren't that good if someone else gets there faster. Very much a race game in feeling as everything you can do for points is worth more if you do it sooner than your competitors. When you do something in this game is at least as important as what you do.

I'm not much of a "spatial relations" type guy, but this game is still fun. It is very straight forward but has some interesting decisions, especially with the board you get and even more so with the missions.

I do wish there was more stuff going on as it is very light and straight forward most of the time (put pieces that cover the most area up and leave room for bigger pieces since they give more points, get you closer to getting bear statues, and end the game faster). I enjoy the missions that are not related to simply building the biggest thing but require you to plan around them and take a hit here and there to get more points through the goal.

This definitely went well with the wife. Brought it with us on a trip to play over some long holidays and we definitely played almost 8 or more games.

The game is easy to explain, you just place a tile, and pick up what new tiles that the placement grants you. Whoever who has the most points at the end wins. It's fast as well but still presents some varying degrees of decision making. And at the end that feeling of building up a bear park, each time very different definitely makes the wife happy. 

We've only played with the basic version of the game thus far, and i suspect there will be more fun to be had once we start using the achievements. In a 2 player game, I find that scores are maybe a little too close sometimes, and we even had a game where we draw but we have no left over tiles for tie-breaker.

The ability to scale up to 4 players is definitely a winner in my books. I will have to see how it plays with more and if it has more interesting tensions. 

The difference of this to Azul is the more solitaire game play that is present in this. I find myself more of looking for what pieces fits and how to get them rather than looking to see what my opponent is doing. The bear statues become the biggest point scorers and I look to optimize my pieces to cover bigger ground with lesser moves and snatch the statues and close out fast.

But the game definitely stands apart from Azul and is definitely a nice tile-laying game to have in my collection.

This game gives you some tiles, and by laying tiles you not only score points, but also get new tiles. The order in which you place the tiles and puzzle the different shapes is what this game is all about.
This is what it is: a family friendly game that doesn't offer 10 different strategies to explore, but hey, this is good fun, so I wouldn't mind playing this a couple more times!

RATING: 6.8
another Tetris-style puzzle game similar to "Patchwork"/"Cottage Garden"/...
but with some nice twists (getting new tiles by overbuilding special spots, competing for tiles with more scoring points, achievement tiles, ...)
and an almost soothing theme
short and plays fast

It's still just a puzzle game and mostly multiplayer Solitaire, but I think the theme and the twists make it superior to most similar games.

Quite thinky. Not the most interactive game, since it can become a bit of a ‘head-down, solitaire’ game at times. But still fun, good sense of satisfaction and the bonus cards (for, say, completing 6 green tiles all adjacent to each other, or the first to get three Polar Bear tiles) are a good challenge to add spice.

The strategy is straightforward, and the mechanics are nothing new. This one isn't breaking new ground. And yet, it's delightful and charming. The artwork is perfect, and the game has just enough meat to warrant repeat plays when you're in the mood for something a little lighter. Spatial planning a la Patchwork meets multi-player drafting. You have to plan ahead, but it's never taxing. The game's a winner. Definitely play with the additional goal cards. I think the game would veer into the boring without them.

First play impression: Pretty impressed.

Where games like Dominion and Century just take a simple mechanic and boil it down to its essential parts, Barenpark does the same with spatial tile placement.

You place a tile onto your player board and then you take another tile (or sometimes multiple tiles) based on which symbols you covered up with your tile. That's literally all there is. No economy aspect to manage, no card-flipping or dice rolling, no intermittent scoring, nothing.

The scoring is all about a race to victory points. Most of the tiles that you place will have victory points printed on them, and the stacks of tiles become less valuable as the stacks start to dwindle. The first tile in a stack might be worth six points, but the next tile is only four points, and so on.

Besides your starting player board, you'll add other small boards onto your park and eventually you'll fill them in with tiles too. This adds on to the race element because as you completely fill up each board with tiles, you get a number of victory points. But these points also decrease, so you want to try to fill in each of your boards as fast and efficiently as possible.

That's the entire game, but there are also optional achievements that you can add to the game. They add yet another race element. The first person to place certain tiles will get so many points, then the next person to do it will get fewer points, etc.

Then at the end of the game you just add up all of the points that are in your park. No bonus points or anything like that. Just add up all of the numbers that you see.

The only slightly negative thing I can think of is that the game can be AP prone. Not 10-minute turns or anything, but longer turns than one would like in a family-level game with such a simple ruleset. This is a spatial game with almost no randomness and you need to plan ahead to build your park effectively. Sometimes you need to think through all of the different options, and some players might even need to take a few different tiles and try them out to see how they'll fit into their park before making their final decision. This can really slow things down when all you're really doing is playing a tile then claiming a tile.

I have to say when I see that a game uses those Tetris pieces I'm usually not excited.  I don't like Patchwork and I guess I'm just not a big fan of spatial puzzles. But there's just something about the ease of play and the colorful look of Barenpark that reels me in. Will have to rate after more plays, but so far I'm sold.

Just from the rules this seems not to be a game for me: 
1st: The theme. I don't think bear parks are good, especially those which host ice bears. 99% of the games I own/play the theme doesn't matter or bother me, but in this case I have huge doubts!
2nd: Too many rule adjustments depending on player account. I hate such rules. Every time you play the game you have to double check which tiles to put back in the box. 
I like tile laying and puzzling games, but this one doesn't catch me. Sorry!

Lovely game, reminiscent of Pathwork & Cottage Garden but with some nice twists of its own. Artwork is lovely and the rules are nice and simple. Deep enough without the bonus cards but they do add some nice depth to your decision making and overall strategy in the same way as games like Suburbia etc.

This game is fast and very fun. It's never going to be one I'm too upset about losing, but the puzzley nature of the game keeps me engaged from beginning to end. I'm really becoming a fan of Phil Walker Harding (with the exception of Imhotep, which is just okay).

1st impressions: Keen to play again, but for all the physical similarities to Patchwork this surprised me with how little this actually felt like Patchwork. A key difference here is how far ahead you can plan - I felt like I was always playing 3 or 4 turns into the future, whereas with Patchwork you are never quite sure what your opponent is going to take so you aren't sure what is going to be available to you. Another difference is the better tiles in Barenpark are just better, so the game is a race to grab those tiles, whereas in Patchwork the relative values of the tiles change as the game progresses giving it a wonderful arc.
I feel like there are two ways to play: 1. You stare at the board planning out and optimising your next 5 moves, or you sit around with beer and nuts and talk with your friends while casually completing a game every now and then. The first mode feels a bit like terra mystica where you are tying to out-optimse your friends, the second mode feels like a disservice to the game but would be a lot of fun.

Super bland point-salad with nothing at all that feels unique or interesting to me.  Still functions fine as a game so there are worse options, but the flow just isn't, well... anything.  It's purely a series of slightly out-pipping opponents by getting some things a turn sooner than them for one extra point.

Plays faster than one might expect.  Puzzle type game that works better with the advanced variant because it shifts the game from a "fill your park quick" game to a "fill your park wisely" game.

I was concerned that the first player has too much of an advantage in the "race" aspect of the game.  However, multiple plays later, I have concluded there is very little advantage to the first player.  Have played at two and four player counts.  I prefer four players, as it adds a bit more suspense to the game.

Family Tetris puzzle.  Wildlife supporters race to be first to arrange different bear habitats and features on their individual park boards while matching set pattern goals and utilizing all usable space.  I like how covering board symbols with placed tiles determines the subset of pieces you will select and place in the following turn.

Very enjoyable game. Relaxing with good choices.  Biggest drawback is that it has the worst insert I've ever seen. Everything is just a mess in the box and I know that having to sort all this later may cause me to not want to play. Also the printing mistakes on the board is annoying. I paid $38.50 for this game. 25-30 is more reasonable. Definitely do not pay as much as I did. But again it's a good game. Don't get me wrong. And I had fun with it, just slightly disappointed for the price I paid.

Having considered all the new tetris games - Patchwork, Indian Summer etc I decided this was ideal as a relaxing outing for gamers and non alike. Nice heavy duty tiles and loads of them; lush, outdoorsy art with blues and greens galore. Fast, simple clickety click gameplay ideal for my 7 yr old.

At first I was worried that the game would suffer from sameness, but after about 10 plays, I'm surprised how varied the game actually is. Just like Imhotep, the choices this game has to offer are simple, yet nuanced and tough.

Such a fantastic tile laying game. It takes this whole concept of fitting Tetris-like pieces on a board and elevates it while simultaneously streamlining it. Cute theme, easy turns, and a great pace.

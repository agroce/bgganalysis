Sociable and nice game for any "empty" moment. I think this is as good as the Pirate Fluxx. Martian technology and pathetic humans bring their nice flavour to this one. If you like other fluxxes, you probably like this one, too!

Fluxx, in general, is for people looking for something crazy without a lot of consistency. Things can change in a second, and so long-term strategy goes out the window. Still, it's a fun, filler game with people who aren't feeling all that serious.

Unexpectedly fun. I'm coming around to liking it as much as Zombie Fluxx, but it's not quite there yet. Quite often, our games have run no longer than 5 minutes. It's great when you're looking for a really quick game, but it sometimes feels like it's over before you know it. Then again, that also means you get to play it again without losing much time.

Suffers the same problem as all the Fluxx games: there's no strategy whatsoever. Draw cards and play them. Exact numbers of each change frequently as the rules change which is the gimmick in this game. Since the end condition keeps changing, too, it's almost impossible to plan any moves. Also means that games can last two minutes or two hours. Not too good.

RATING: 4
As much as I enjoyed the original Fluxx, I can't say that I care much for this iteration.  The deck seems to be extremely heavy with Goals, and it was extremely frustrating to be constantly drawing more and more of them, without ever feeling like you're changing your position in the game.  The original game was heavily focused on Action cards, which made you feel like you had some choice in how to play out your hand, but this one made it feel like we were continuously drawing crap while waiting anxiously for the one card that will cause you to win the game.  I'd rather play the original Fluxx over Martian Fluxx any day.

What I like:
- Cute theme
- Far less screwage than most fillers
- Portable

What I don't like:
- Games can last (literally) one minute, or can go 45+ minutes
- The designer has filed patents for other boardgame mecahnisms


With 2p, there can be so many creepers that it can be really hard for anyone to win. I would prefer fewer creepers and/or more cards that churn creepers (and maybe also keepers).

Fluxx is for sure one of those that I am willing to play when asked and would have a decent amount of fun while playing but I really don't seek them out, overall they are too chaotic for my liking to really enjoy the Fluxx series, they can easily overstay their welcome, too.
The martians have some goofy moments when a winning goal is to have cows, I like that all humans are pathetic, nice that players don't fight but play as Martians. If I had to choose a Fluxx I would stick with the Zombie version because, duh, Zombies, but Martians are a not too bad choice either.

In Martian Fluxx, the players are invaders from Mars, and the Creepers are those pesky Pathetic Humans who are always getting in our way, keeping us from winning. Cows of course are Keepers because for Humans and Martians alike, they're good eating. There are actually two Cow Keepers in the game; if you have them both you can win with the Goal "Two All-Beef Earthlings."

I cannot qualify this game as being boring or as being bad or as being unplayable. It is simply the most uninsteresting game I have ever played. We had 5 sessions and we all arrived to the same conclusion: this game is a waste of time. Winning or losing feels the same: a complete insatisfaction. May I recommend you forget this if you are looking for a good time among friends... or enemies or another human being... or alien.

It's Fluxx, so it's fun, but this was actually not as good as I was expecting it to be. While there seems to be more strategy behind what the cards do in the game play, it seems to take away from the random fun that Fluxx is - almost putting the way the theme is handled in opposition to the core game.

It felt like the game would have benefited from a greater number of human creepers. They just didn't seem to come up often enough.

I also felt like certain card actions that you could perform were kind of pointless - such as being able to prevent people from stealing your human creepers. And even if there's one goal or new rule card that benefits from you keeping your creepers, it just doesn't feel like enough to warrant the protection effect. This gave the impression that there would be or needed to be an expansion.

This one will probably be last in line in which version of Fluxx I play in the future.

A great laugh if there's a bunch of you.  Warning - use of "Germs" can cause friction among friends.

My first card/filler game. Simple rules and easy to pick up. I like the way this version plays compared to Zombie Fluxx.

Another reworking of Flux.  Really just Zombie Flux with a make-over.  But a good theme so I picked it up.

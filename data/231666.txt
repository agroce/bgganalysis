Solo card game(yes,it can be played with up to 4 but same rules, just more fuss). It's essentially a puzzle that once solved, you have to bury the game and forget of its existance, then unbury it after some years and replay it, hoping you've forgotten how the solution went: talk about replayability. Artwork is basic, cards are large and sturdy: overall, nothing to brag about. All in all play a few times, solve it once, pass it along (or burn it..).

This was the one that I looked forward to play the most of the fast forward series. I was a little worried about the replayability due to the puzzle-like design. I’m not even sure if you could finish this on the first run, but seems unlikely. I think the design is great, but didn’t enjoy playing it as much as I thought I would.

Flee was the first of the Fast Forward series from Friedeman Friese that I played. I had no idea what to expect, but I played as a 4 player game. The aspect of learning as you go works (for a relatively gamery group), introducing this puzzly cooperative game and creating a mini-legacy-like experience. Is it a great game? No. Was it fun and worth playing? Yes. We played for at least 90 minutes and got through 2 or so games, but not the whole deck. I feel like there is more to do here and I could see picking up this game even though I know it won't get a ton of play. It's the best of the Fast Forward games and the most complex too... though, it isn't really complicated. It's just that the other two are pretty simple.

I played this twice with gamers at a convention and then twice with my son at home... at that point, I didn't have any interest in playing again because I had seen all there was to see.  I did enjoy playing it and was glad to have the opportunity to experience the whole game.  Now, I'll trade it or sell it and move on.  This almost works like an Escape the Room style game, especially if you try to play it through without ever losing.  But, the story and options are a bit looser... it feels more like you are playing a game.  Friese often creates new and interesting games and this is yet another.  His interesting ideas don't always work well, but I always appreciate them and I found that this one did work pretty well.

RATING: 3
A truly admirable puzzle design, and a really neat concept, but unfortunately it's just not something I enjoyed playing at all.

Flee boils down to a puzzle, which is solved via a sequence of moves. Along the way, you'll screw up, and then fix your sequence of moves to avoid screwing up again. This means there's a lot of memory involved, as you need to remember the sequence so as not to screw it up.

We also felt some of the rules that were introduced were a bit cumbersome to grok, and were worded in rather unclear ways. They took several reads before we thought we understood them, with some minor doubts. This seems like it could have been delivered in a more clear manner.

I just don't at all like this sort of puzzle, but if you do, you'll likely love it, and I do really admire it as a cool thing that pushes some game design boundaries.

Played the first chapter Essen'17. I liked the idea, but it was, from the beginning, very annoying that everybody has to read out every card (maybe even multiple times as you forget what it was about), so that one knows what is does. This might get better over time, but as meaningful symbols are missing this problem does not disappear completely, I believe. I want to like that, please give me a better version of this game ;-).

F. Friese went to the mad scientist way and he never stopped.
I like the concept of the Fast Forward series, it feels like a distillation of the game Fabled Fruit.
I love the puzzle nature of the game.
I mainly played in solo mode. I'm eager to play with my wife, sat by my side, and enjoying the puzzle together.

played until we hit the monster twice. The idea behind the game is nice and can be fun. But in the end none of us was een to play it a third time. We all had the feeling we would go through the same moves again with not much improvement.

Much reading necessary which hurts speed of play. Meaningful symbols would have been nice. Like the idea of learning the rules while playing. Quite enjoyable. May be prone to alpha player syndrom.

Maybe it's because I played this after Fear (which I thought was lame), but I really liked this game. It's puzzly and fun, and while the Alice in Wonderland theming doesn't matter in any meaningful sense, I like the look of the game. I played this solitaire (I was gun shy about setting this in front of my friends after Fear), but I think it would make a decent co-op. I also don't think this is as unreplayable as some say. You'll know some of the surprises, but l doubt you'll remember all the cards or the order they come out in. All told, this was fun. It's priced high if you only play once, but there's no reason you couldn't pass this on if you don't want to play it again. This was billed as based on escape rooms, and while it doesn't feel like one in the traditional sense, I liked this better than other card-only puzzles like Unlock and Deckscape. Impressive.

More puzzle than game. Probably best solo.
The puzzle is about knowing which cards are in the deck and in which order to play them. It's probably impossible to win this on the first try, since you need advance knowledge of what is in the deck.

Flee is the second Fast Forward game after Fear that I have played. It's cooperative and more complicated than Fear. The rules border on the limit of what is feasible with the concept of learning them on the fly whenever a new rules card is revealed. Repeatedly, we had to look through the rules again when we had different recollections of them.

The game itself is a puzzle of how to solve the task on hand. One of the four actors has a monster card. If it is ever his turn while holding the monster, the players lose. Other cards allow manipulating the turn order, exchanging cards etc. As the card order is fixed, the game is solvable. Except for the challenge to keep all rules in mind as a single player, there's few to be gained by involving more players in solving the puzzle.

With the novelty of discovering new rules and the goal of the game gone, I have no interest to play this again although we have lost our game with the last card. Better puzzles to be solved.

This game is not easy. I guess I don’t know what I was expecting. After 3 hours, we were only 2/3 of the way through. I’m not completely sure how replayable this game Ian once you beat it. We only played it with two players, which always gave us the feeling of having lots to do.

Man, I love the concept. I liked the initial gameplay.

But it felt VERY linear, where you had one path you could take and if you didn't do it right pretty much the whole time, you wouldn't win. I also HATED the ending. I felt entirely like one of those "Hahahahaha, got you! You suck!" twist endings.

So I wouldn't play this again, and I wouldn't recommend that other people play it.

I will try to other Fast Forward games, but if one of the others is like it, I won't play any of the others. I'm really glad I tried this out from the BGG library and didn't actually buy it because I would have been pissed.

Impressions after first game:
Credits for the idea. Very innovative to have a game without a rulebook. The premise of the game is fairly simple; escape from a monster by reaching the end of the deck, a player can't own the monster of the beginning of turn or everyone loses. 
We lost game after going a little bit over half the deck, it was simple to play yet tactical. However, the amount of text in some cards makes it boring to play or not as engaging, so I never felt like I was having fun. I'm sure the gameplay gets better as you are familiar with the rules and don't have to read the conditions as they come up, but after first play, cant' say I was excited about it.

More complicated than some of the other Fast Forward games, made it more difficult to see what I should be doing.  Nice use of artwork, so I will forgive the use of Alice as the theme.  A lot of text we had to interpret: think we got it right.  We lost my only play so far.

I just don't get the rules, box says it's 1-4 players but pretty much asks me to simulate all 4 players when I try to play it with 1. I feel cheated and downright fleeced (local price in local boardgame store is 17.95 €) right from the behinning. It's hard to even try to learn the game when you have if not technically lied to but seriously mislead.

I was quiet disappointed with this one initially. The first chapter is very restricted and there is pretty much the perfect way to solve it. I'm happy I stuck with it though as I found it got a lot more interesting during chapter 2 and when having to restart from there. 
Not sure if I'm ever going to play it again now that I "solved" it, but it was a fun solo puzzle for quiet a while and ended up as a solid puzzle (once you get through the first bit, which  just didn't enjoy too much).

It is easy to learn and simple to play, though it seems like a game could go for quite a while. Feel like you really need to memorize the deck to play effectively. Limited options; feels like there's a fairly narrow solution (this might not be true). Just not grabbing us.

Our first session went like this:  (no spoilers)

- Barely made it through the first chapter, then failed immediately
- Barely made it through the second chapter, then failed immediately

In my book, Flee has a hard limit of two players (see [i]box lying[/i] in the dictionary), unless you're a cadre of androids looking to practice your defense subroutines before the inevitable human uprising.

There's a decent puzzle here, but that's all. It's procedural and dry, and would be extremely frustrating if you never made progress.  So while there's potential satisfaction tucked inside, there's not much fun.

Also, as a Friese game, expect the usual mistranslations and rules confusion.

Bonus complaint: Characters are placed in a circle, but turn order is represented by a straight arrow. How is that even remotely helpful?

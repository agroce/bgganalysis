Not my favorite Haba stacking game but no slouch. In Rhino hero you are stacking a card tower and moving a rhino hero up and down its ever more precarious levels. The game is quick and light and fun. Hardly a meaty all night affair, this game is great to bring some levity before or after a long grind of another more heavy game has begun or ended.

Silly card-stacking game.  Nothing heavy.  As with other balancing games, it requires players of a similar skillset in order to get the most fun out of it.

RATING: 8
Fairly neat for a simple dexterity game, but the little guy already loves setting it up and knocking it down.  I've played quite a few times with a toddler and preschooler.

Playing with adults is still a fun, social time, especially with poking fun at how others arrange the cards and attempt to game the rules.  Great for what it is!

1st play: Tested it out with the wife, cute kid's version of building a house of cards with typical excellent Haba production values.  Seems like a perfect game for a 4-7 year old kid, as the balancing isn't too hard and the tower grows pretty high.

2nd play: We've played this 4 times in two days and the kids actually requested it. Kids games don't score very well, so 6 reflects about as high as a kids game gets for me. But in the realm of kid games this one is good. My kids aren't patient enough so our towers don't get very high, but plenty of room for improvement.

Good and very fun game, it is a good filler and it remind me of Jenga in some level, but it is funnier and adds some good layers to it that make it preferable than Jenga.

Best with 2-3 players (4 is a stretch). Also, we play with house rules where:
1. Everyone will get a chance to start
2. Score is number of roof cards on hand when the tower topples down.
3. Lowest score wins.
4. Whoever topples down the tower has +3 added to his/her final score. 

Everyone will get a chance to start and whoever topples down the tower has +3 added to his/her final score.

RATING: 7.5
Adorable kids' variation on Jenga which is probably more of a game than the original. You're stacking cards and folded cardboard walls, but with each floor there can be a slight rules change based on the card you use for the floor. And of course, you've gotta keep placing that cute rhino token when called for...

Bought it for my young son. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.

This game is the result of a crossbreed between Animal Upon Animal and UNO!
Every player has a hand of roof cards and the goal is getting rid of them, building a house, using special "bendable" wall cards.
Each roof has a "blueprint" showing how the next wall level has to be built! as well as possible special powers.
Very funny dexterity game, even for adults!

My nephew who's in kindergarten loves this game. He takes out all the cards that don't move the rhino . He'll play it for hours trading in and out opponents till everyone tells him they tired of it. He's not wrong. Moving the rhino is the best part. 

The art is great. The stacking isn't too hard so it's not too taxing till it gets super tall. I'm going to have to admit I have a terrible weakness for all stacking games though.

This is another great haba game for kids, that is perfectly enjoyable to adults without kids any way. In this game you stack cards from your hand and try to not knock over the tower. There are also uno type cards that can reverse the order, or cause someone to draw a card or skip. Very fun and simple stacking game, that works for anyone 5ish and up.

My 4 years old daughter loved it from the very first minute.

*update*

I have to admit that this game hasn't clicked for my daughter as good as other games after the inicial reception. She prefers whatever else before this one, I believe it's due to her difficulty to place the cards when the building is too tall and she has to stand on the chair to get to the roof. I guess that she feels in disavantage compared to me.

Another enjoyable game by HABA, even though it boils down to just card house stacking. The special abilities on the cards helps makes this game one that keeps getting back to the table for many plays.

Cards can be pulled out of the box and rubber banded together with the Rhino, or dropped in a deck box.  A better stacking game than something older like Jenga, and works in a wider set of situations than the Toc Toc Woodman series.  Fantastic for keeping in a go box/bag and having at bars/restaurants, or when traveling since it can be played on any flat surface, with anyone from kids to senior citizens.

Simple Haba dexterity game. Start w/ 4-5 cards. Place cards, which act as floors, and walls to build a vertical column of cards. Some cards have special circumstances, i.e. reverse the order of play or place two cards. The player knocking it over loses, otherwise, the first person to have zero cards in their hand wins. Suitable for a variety of ages. Tension mounts as the tower of cards grows higher and higher. Easy to explain and plays quick.

This is a really good family game that I can't wait to play with my girls when they get older!  I understand why this game is such a popular dexterity game among families. The visual aspect is very appealing, and the challenge of the gameplay itself seems to have a good level for younger players (and, maybe even too tough for some adults who often seem to lack fine motor skills compared to children!)
The tower of apartments you're building has cute images, and the Rhino itself is so cool! Now, it's definitely not a huge strategy game (way too much luck in the cards, and some are infinitely better than others), but every game doesn't need to be. This is just plain simple a cosy game to play - with very tense moments once the tower is getting higher and higher, and you let out a sigh of relief once your turn is over and you haven't toppled the tower!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

It's a charming little game and I enjoy building a precarious structure but I don't think the cards' special abilities are fun nor do I feel any sense of accomplishment i.e. that I won, when other players cause the tower to collapse.

A card version of Animal Upon Animal that is a slightly harder game as each roof card has its own rules that you need to apply and each player has a hand of cards in secret. Getting the cards in place can be a little tricky, but it definitely provides an interesting twist and the bendable cards are pretty sweet. I look forward to playing this again as an alternative even if we are just playing it now to stack the cards as high as we can go.

Just introduced this to a "non gamer" friend. She loved it! She kept asking to play another round so we ended up playing 5 or 6 rounds.
It's great fun, very simple, easy to teach or learn.
Probably less skill involved than in other dexterity games but it's just so much fun watching the tower grow and making that little rhino climb up the levels!

For the price and for what it is (a little kid's dexterity game thatc comes ina  small box with a cute rhino meeple): fantastic!

RATING: 6
Simple children's card game with great components.  Players are slowly building a house of cards, level by level.  The level played by the previous player dictates where the next level's supports have to be placed, as well as a possible constraint on the level (player has to draw a card, miss a turn, move the super rhino piece up to the current level, etc).  As the house gets taller, it becomes more precarious until the inevitable collapse and hilarity.  Sort of like reverse Jenga, but very much a fun and accessible game.  Great Haba presentation too.

A great little filler game, which is sort of a much cooler version of Jenga.

Super Rhino has players building a tower of cards which the little figure of Super Rhino must climb, the basic aim of the game is to use all of the cards in your hand before the tower collapses, and don't be the player that makes it collapse!

[b]Rating based on - 2 plays, 2 player[/b]
A cute little rhino stars in a stacking dexterity game where you stack cards that consist of walls and roofs. The roof cards have special powers that allow you to stack more than one roof card, let another player take an extra card etc. and the first to finish their hand of cards wins. Very much luck dependent (in the 2 player game anyway) as you only need to out manoeuvre one person. If you have a hand of special cards and the other person only has regular roofs or rhino cards then you're golden.

It was OK, but I doubt the memory of it will last and I'm frankly quite surprised about the hype that surrounds it. Much prefer playing Kapitan Wackelpudding which is also a kids and family friendly dexterity stacking game. The different shapes and configurations make it much more exciting. This was very bland.

Silly, light, fast, lots of fun.

It's a perfect dexterity filler and an awesome gateway game. There's also some kind of Uno element (you can reverse the order of play, skip the next player and so on), but if that bothers you for some reason, you can just ignore it. Any game that makes people get up and move around the table is a keeper in my book! Has never let me down.

Oh, and it's probably fun for kids as well...

Excellent Jenga style game whereby you must build a new floor to the building on each of your turns with the previously played cards dictating how you must build that floor, the building can actually get quite high actually.

The super rhino meeple is really quite clever as occassionally you need to move him up to the floor you just built. quite often the Rhino was a counter balance to the tower so as soon as he is moved the building collapses and that player loses. 

Really quick really fun simple little filler.  :)

It's fine. It's cute! I like being able to build the apartment out of cards and moving the Rhino slowly upwards is really neat (and strangely I can't think of another dexterity game that does something like this). I really don't like the action cards. Skipping turns, taking extra cards, etc.  Those really can dictate the winner. If you're playing with kids, usually one will knock down the tower - so no biggie. But with a group of steadier individuals, the player who got attacked the least will most likely win. So it goes! Good game for kids though, so I'm keeping it at school.

A dexterity game with cards! Don't worry, it's not just a card castle. The Wall cards have a crease in the middle and you play them in 90 degree angles.

Dexterity game--Reverse Jenga meets Uno. Fun for all ages.
What makes things really interesting/challenging is how sometimes a player will have to pick up the Rhino Meeple (who is standing in the card tower) and place him on the highest level. The Rhino meeple makes this precarious tower of cards unbalanced and more in danger of falling. You feel pretty awesome each time you survive your turn.

Probably one of my favourite haba games. Almost like a reverse jenga. I also like the fact the cards all have different abilities - almost uno-esc. Despite being a german game i think there is enough in this game that kids might find famillar to more mainstream western games, thats its really approachable. Unfortunatly, really only a game for kids, i'd be hard pressed to find this game that replayable with adults unless there was alcahol involved. I think its a good middle group for as a game that an adult might enjoy playing with a child though.

Rated as a kids game, although I think it would be fun with adults too. Kids need to have a certain amount of dexterity, so think age 6+, but if they can handle Animal Upon Animal, they can handle this. Really cute theme.

Great game for kids and adults, because it seems like just a kid's game until the building is 6-7 levels tall, then it becomes something new entirely. We use a lot of house rules (sometimes making the person that knocks over the tower try a beanboozled jelly bean)

Good fun with the kids, this one has an impressive table presence as it builds higher. Other than the rhino cards I find the different cards fairly redundant but I suppose they add a little extra layer. Almost always raises a smile but grows old fairly quickly.

Rhino Hero succeeds in being an awesome game for both kids and adults.  The difficulty comes less from the actual building of the tower, but more so from moving that Rhino Hero guy.  He has a way of getting stuck in some pretty out of reach areas which makes it difficult for adult hands to pull him from.  Awesome game!

An excellent stacking game for families.  Card powers can be harder for younger kids to understand, so maybe Animal Upon Animal would be more for them.  Kids also need to be taught that you only bend the wall cards, not the roof cards (bending cards becomes the fun thing to do for new players I've found).  Those towers can stack taller than you may think and some fun tension builds the taller it gets.  If you happen to get a hand of one or more 2x cards, the game can be unfairly "stacked" in your favor.  Har har.

Clever to see a balancing game using only cards, but the gameplay is thin stuff. With the carefully prescribed positions for cards and the rhino there's no real potential for setting up awkward positions for your opponents, and the powerups on the cards are Uno-level skip a turn stuff.

RATING: 8
Rhino Hero is a solid family game.  

In RH, the first player plays a roof card.  Roof cards are flat, and each has spots detailing where any walls must be placed on it by the next player.  Each roof also may have one of a few simple symbols on it (effects like Skip Next Player, Reverse Player Order). 

Every turn, a player adds walls (folded cards) and then places a roof on top.  The roof you play determines where the next player must put the walls.  A card with the Rhino Hero symbol on it means that you place the Rhino Hero (a wooden meeple) on the top card. Placing a new Rhino Hero card mean that the meeple must be moved from it's current location to the new level.

This game works great with families, but also does EXTREMELY well as a Jenga substitute.  The only quibbles with it are that the cards have symbols on them that you need to reference in the rulebook instead of simple saying "Skip" or "Reverse", and that it doesn't have a lot of longevity.  

Kids will LOVE it, though, and it's a good gateway game.   It adds the bonus of being very affordable and portable.   There is a sequel called  "Super Rhino Hero" that is a lot deeper and more fleshed out.

Not the hero we need, but the one that we deserve. A cute and fun kid's dexterity game with an awesome Rhino meeple complete with superhero get-up. Players draw a card and then build another floor of a building, as the rhino scales it. All of the cards in this are completely bendable and it blows my mind. A dexterity game I can sit through, and it has all of the jenga 'uh oh, any minute' feels.

This is the perfect opener/closer and great to finish a night with at a gaming con. Simple dexterity game where drama is created as the card tower is built higher and higher and one almost wants to work together to keep building higher...but eventually, all good things come crashing down. :-)

So fun! It's Haba, so the components are great. The cards are gorgeous, especially the little foil accents.

I love dexterity games, particularly those that are fun with kids and adults, and RH fits that bill perfectly. The tower gets impressively precarious, there are two difficulties to choose from at the outset, the cards are silly, and the whole thing is easy for everyone to grok. And all that in two decks of cards and a rhinople!

Pure dexterity, some luck (what others play "on" you), and an escalating challenge, all perfectly executed.

It's made for children and contains minimal rules and strategy, but it's a very fun and social game to pass the time or play with non-gamers who might not be interested in other games.

Quick playing and silly fun - the 9 year old I was playing with was having a blast (even though he couldn't control his trembling due to too much sugar).  As a game, however, a lot of the rules don't end up mattering that much - even with only 2-3 people we never got close to someone running out of roof times before it all came tumbling down so making someone draw an extra card or get skipped etc was rather irrelevant.  That might be different in a group of more careful players.

With five players, the game is too often over before somebody gets a turn. Three or four players is better.

Már régóta meg van, de még sosem került az asztalra, pedig rendszeresen magammal hordtam. Ma végre megtört a jég! olyannyira, hogy egymás után 5 partit lenyomtunk, majd ezt megismételtük az este végén! Nagyon szórakoztató! Senkit nem érdekel, hogy ki nyer, egyszerűen baromi izgalmas, látványos, és mindenki talpon szurkolja végig (persze, különben fel sem érné a tetejét :P). Aztán az építmény gyorsan összedől, és jöhet a következő parti! Sokkal jobb, mint a Jenga (pörgősebb és cukibb), az UNO-s elemek meg egy idő után már nem érdekesek, ahogyan az sem, kinek mennyi lapja maradt. A lényeg, hogy muszáj azonnal még egyet játszani! :)

(Rated as a family/children's game)

One of my favourite 'yellow box' Haba games so far. Essentially this is a stacking game, but stacking cards to build a tower. You will stack one or two 'walls' and then add a ceiling or roof which tells you how to place the next walls and also any effects to play. Great for kids of all ages.

Uno meets Jenga. While I'm not a big fan of either of those games, this game has a lot of charm that comes through in the components, and it helps suck me in to what's going on. Plus it's over so quickly that it's easy to laugh about the house of cards crumbling down before you're ready for another round. Really neat family game.

Build a tower out of the cards and move the Rhino from level to level as shown on the cards. Special cards can reverse turn order, skip a turn, draw additional cards or use up a second floor card. First player to use all their floor cards wins, if a player knocks over the tower they lose. A quick, fun, quirky game.

Jenga meet your better. Only gripe about this game is the size of the box means you have to re-flatten the wall cards each time you put it a way. I can see this being a real problem when the game gets older and the cards lose some of their hardiness.

Perfect filler game though.

My understanding is that their is a jumbo version of this game out there now, which makes me sad that I have the smaller one.

I guess it was inevitable that someone would work out a way to turn the building of a card tower into a game. They've done it pretty well. A card is placed which has a symbol (play again, next player draws a card, etc). The card also has an outline showing where the next player must place walls, which are heavy cardboard 2 inch long pieces which bend 90 degrees at the middle. So the first thing the next player does is place these walls, and then place a card on top (indicating what the next player must do), building ever higher and higher. Some cards have a rhino symbol meaning you need to extract the rhino meeple from whichever card its on and place it on top, which adds extra pressure. It's a dexterity game obviously so if the card tower collapses, you're gone-ski. The tower is surprisingly stable at high heights which makes for fun, and yet it's always on a precipice as well, making for good tension. Make sure you're playing on a no-knock stable table. As kids games go, this seems like a really good one. As adult games go, it's a bit of fun.

Excellent for what this does. A quick dexterity game for kids and adults. A filler that doesn't need a lot of table space, except for the height factor. Better than Jenga and Uno combined. Very good production.

Good Lord, is this game awesome. I love playing it with my 4-year-old daughter--she especially loves moving the rhino up the tower. But I've also played it exclusively with adults and it's a hit. It's one that I'm tempted to bring out just to play on my own and see how high I can get the tower.

A great stacking dexterity game. The cards are such a fickle construction medium, and the size of them make for a excitingly tall building before it crashes down.

My kid (4) just loves this game. The tower is sturdy enough that it doesn't fall on lower levels even with his over excitement and we often end up playing past the winning point. We haven't played the hard mode much (only one supporting beam) cause that'd be frustrating.

Since it's a game that's enjoyable to play as an adult too, I ended up buying extra copies for gifts.

In this game you build a tower made of cards, and if you place the last roof card in your hand, you win. However, if you cause the tower to fall, you lose. This game works well for young children, ages 3 to 5.  Three-year-olds will need some help with the card play, but should be able to build the roofs, and even the walls with some instructive help.  The fun thing about the game is the adults are not necessarily better than the children, as building towers is something these kids practice while adults are at work.  It’s a quick game, easy to set up and clean up, and the kids are naturally drawn to the building part of it.  

Update: The rhino really is the hero of this game.  That piece keeps bringing the kids back to this game, and they love placing it.

My rating involves how eager I am to bring out the game compared to other games for children 3-8 years old.

Stacking up cards folded and unfolded and moving around the Rhino Heroeeple. It's sorta like Uno, but the tower always falls after about four floors are built up, and then whoever has the least cards wins. Considering that if someone plays a 'draw another card' floor against you, you're not going to win. Super filler, super family, and not that great in execution. 

The current working theory is that Super Rhino is the tiny rhino who rides in and pilots the giant robot Rhino Hero.

Having played a bit more, it's actually no worse than Animals upon Animals, which is pretty glowing praise truly.

A pretty fun kid's game where you build a precarious tower made out of cards. First person to knock the tower over loses, then you determine the winner based on how many cards people have left in their hands (or you play it where the first player to rid their hand of cards first wins). It's fun and silly and works with a lot of ages. If I had one complaint it's that if you're playing with kids, it's possible to draw a lot of "Skip your Turn" cards, thus frustrating whichever child is sitting to your left. 

"Take that" or "Skip a Turn" plays in kid's games are a mixed bag. Kids want to [i]play[/i], and while it might be funny to skip someone now and again, I've had games of this where I've had no choice but to disproportionately skip my 3-year-old. Yeah, you can redeal, so it's not a major issue, but it needs to be monitored. Otherwise, this game can be great fun.

This game encompasses the addiction of a board game experience in a nutshell. Without a board too. How can a few pieces , a bundle of limited function cards and some folded walls made of card stock be so brilliant. 
The playability is through the roof in this game. Just the sheer challenging nature of balancing pieces of card on top of one another makes this game rich and entertaining. Its simply outrageous how one small wooden meeple shaped like a rhino can make this game so exhilaratingly entertaining.The energy that comes from playing this is comparable to nothing we have yet to experience. The fun factor is 10. Games should be listed by gameplay, playability and fun factor. This game has very little gameplay. The components are simplistic at best.The thought required is minimal. The artwork is clean but aimed at a younger audience.But the playability and the fun factor are maximum. 
If you need a game to help bring your group/family to life then this is a heavy favorite. We always start off with a few games of rhino hero, I don't think I have ever heard anyone say "No!".

RATING: 6.97
Jogo que resulta de uma fusão entre dois dos jogos mais populares: "Jenga" e "UNO", acabando por ser melhor que qualquer um deles - não que tal fosse muito difícil de se conseguir! Ótimo para a pequenada, este é um jogo onde prima a diversão, podendo proporcionar uma mesa volumosa (em altura), colorida e engraçada. Tem algo que saber, mas não muito, o melhor mesmo é deixar-se levar...

This is a pretty fun card stacking dexterity game. The easy side is pretty easy to stack until someone is out of cards but the harder base makes this fun even for adults.  Great family game that even my 3 and a half year old can play and enjoy.

This is a perfect 5 minute filler game for all ages! A much harder dexterity game than I thought it would be. We haven't had a win by running out of cards yet. The weight of the rhino is significant once you get to the higher levels and it can easily be enough to make it topple. I can see why this is a much loved staple from Haba.

nearly everything i look for in a kids game (minus maybe a memory element): universally challenging, holds attention between rounds, and alternate considerations to keep in mind. this is essentially Uno, but the dexterity element is something you're more likely to run afoul of. when it falls over, you can play again. can play with children and/or while having a beer with friends. it's a perfect bite-sized chunk of game that you can put away in a small box.

Not sure how to rate a child's game. The rating reflects my enjoyment, not the child's.

Anyway, I got this for the times a kid too young for my other games is at my place. This got chosen simply because it takes up so little space on my shelf. It's a deck of cards and a rhino meeple.

Still, it manages to get a lot out of that. The structure you build can be quite impressive and moving the rhino adds a neat wrinkle, though at the end of the day, it's a dexterity game, so it's only going to rate so high for me, but I could see pulling this out for laughs after a beer or two at the end of a gaming session, even without kids around.

Nem utolsó sorban persze a fantasztikus minőségi megvalósításnak. Akár a kártya anyaga, nyomtatása, akár az art rengeteget tesz hozzá az alapötlethez.
Kicsiktől nagyokig (felnőttekig) mindenkinek a kedvence.
Igaz, ügyességi játék, inkább a party jellege dominál erősen, nem szabad túl komolyan venni, nehogy sértődés legyen belőle. A magas szerencsefaktort a könnyű és villámgyors játékmenet kompenzálja.

Currently my favorite stacking game. Which isn't even a challenging stacking game. The popularity of this game eludes me. 

It's very simple to play. Simpler than Animal upon Animal (which has quite some tricks up its sleeve), but looks more adult-friendly. Also the special powers on the cards are mostly UNO related, so they're familiar to mostly everyone. 
The thing about it is the whole card tower building aspect - maybe this evokes something from our childhood. Or maybe it's why building games are so popular - we love to see something being built, only here this is physical. And it's a real building - a skyscraper (kinda wonky one, but sure). 

About the gameplay - it's possible to play evil. You can put floors done in a way the tower is more likely to collapse or even make it so (in certain circumstances) it's almost unlikely the person after you will succeed (forcing the rhino in an odd position). 
The rhino - some people think it's just about him being heavy and likely to destroy the tower. But Rhino is your friend - he can also balance the tower nicely. 

So, it's a game with not much tension, often somebody just wins, but has a unique charm to it. An experience. A story. And it's cheap to pick up.

The game says it's from ages 5-99 and I basically couldn't agree more.  Using cards as walls and roofs, you alternate wall and roof (each roof becomes the new floor) and create a tower that you try not to topple.  With each roof card you play, you may have to move the Rhino Hero onto the new floor.  This is an excellent dexterity game with quality cards and a cute rhino figure!

This is a family favorite; small box, great game. Building the tower requires some dexterity from the kids, but they love to make those high towers. (Re)placing the rhino on the building is a nice twist. Requires a flat, stable surface to avoid frustration. Components are of top notch HABA quality. Would love to find the Rhino Hero Giant Edition!

Fun little tower-building-with-cards game with great artwork, and a cool little Rhino Superhero who has to climb the tower.  Combines elements of Jenga and Uno, but in a fresh and fun way.  Basically rewards dexterity and therefore easier for younger and/or better balanced players.  Still a good family filler, that generates tension and hilarity.

1 play, 2er

In general, I like dexterity games, mostly flicking but also precision stuff like this on occasion. It's very light and fun.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
It's a very simple stacking game where you build a tower of cards (which, fortunately, come pre-folded in halves so you don't have to "ruin" your own cards!). Begin the game with the start floor (one of 2 maps showing) on the table; players each get 5 roof cards (7 in 2er). On your turn, place walls according to the floor plan on the topmost roof (floor). You can use both hands but only touch the walls and roof you're playing. Then place a roof on top. If there's an icon on it, various things happen:
- skip next player
- switch play direction
- you place another roof directly on top (if it's your last card, take one from the player to your left)
- next player draws an extra roof card
- move the rhino hero meeple from current location to the rhino icon

The game ends if:
- the tower collapses: the player with the fewest cards remaining wins
- a player places their last roof: they win!

RATING: 6
Fun, for a few rounds - purchased this mostly for adult Jenga alternative. Surprisingly difficult to stack higher than 8-9 stories. Prefer as co-op, let's build the tower as high as we can! vs competitive game. Prefer Jenga (despite Rhino hero being "cuter") as it can play longer and players have more of an opportunity to actually stack before the tower falls. (Hated skip and reverse cards, so house ruled them)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Rhino Hero is an awesome dexterity game with direct easy rules and short play time as best selling points.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Players take turns building a tower out of folded cards (walls) and flat ones (roofs). Each roof has a pattern showing how the walls to the next level must be built, and a special power (skip a turn, reverse direction of play, move super rhino figure) to affect the next player.

It looks fantastic when set up but there's not a whole lot of game there. Card play is limited, and unlike stacking games such as Animal Upon Animal there is no scope for clever or fiendish placement.

An enjoyable activity for kids -- the tower gets truly, impressively tall! -- but there's not a lot of game there.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The card abilities feel forced and seemingly added to try and turn this otherwise 'activity' into a game. Skipping turns, reversing, drawing extra cards etc mean that you could play an entire game and not have a single turn! These types of card abilities work in Uno because there are usually so many turns, but in Super Rhino each person might have only 2-3 turns. 

Having said that...my daughter loves building up huge skyscrapers and we think it's pretty fun too.

Good, cheap, family fun. It's a simple card stacking game, with the added element of a little wooden figure you have to move up the ever-growing tower. My 6 year old and I really enjoy playing this, and its good if it extends to a kid few adults. Almost every game gets tense when the tower is swaying, and you get the instant pleasure of accomplishment if it stays, and laughter if it falls. I'm not sure if I'd go for this for JUST adults - but it's not bad!

This is a great dexterity game. Players build a tower of cards one turn at a time. Each card can have an ability on them. Among those cards is the Super Rhino card. On this card a little wooden rhino must be moved to the card before the next floor card can be placed. It isn't a big deal when you first start, but on turn three, four, and five can be quite interesting. This game goes over well with almost any age group. One of my favorite games to take to the pub.

About [thing=91514][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=91514][/thing] is a light dexterity game, very pretty to look at, with hand management (including "take that" cards) and more interaction between players than one will find in its close related [thing=2452][/thing].

Coming from Haba, is possible to think this game is for kids, but it truly works marvelously for adults also - I only ever played with adults, and everyone had fun.

[thing=91514][/thing] offers basically the same challenge [thing=2452][/thing] (fiddling with a tower and not knocking it down), but also provides a little more to think about, with the use of the cards.

Overall, [thing=91514][/thing] is a very good game, easy to teach, to play and allowing for a fun time.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Everyone starts with a hand of cards. The building starts with a card which shows how to place the walls of the floor above. The first player must put the walls accordingly with the direction. Then she puts a floor above the newly place walls, and this card will tell the next player how she will place the walls. And so on, until one of three things happen:

a) The building falls. The player that did this loses outright. The rest compare the number of cards in hand and the person with least cards in hands will be the winner;

b) Someone plays her last card. This person wins;

c) All the walls have been placed. Everyone wins!

Many cards, coupled with the layout for the walls, also have effects when placed: making the next player draw a card; skipping the turn of the next player; allowing the player to place two cards instead of just one; changing the order of play; or the best of all: placing the Rhino Hero figure. The cards that have this also have a position in which the Rhino Hero must be placed. If the Rhino already is in the building, in another floor, it must be taken from there and placed in the new floor.

That is basically it.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Just one: which card to play. This has two considerations:
a) Which card will help you the most (usually by prolonging the game) and/or mess the most with the next player, considering the building as it is (if you know the building is leaning heavily to one side, you might want to force the next player to put a wall or the Rhino Hero in that direction);
b) Which card to keep in hand - this matters because often the game will end in a tie in the number of cards in hand two or more players have. The tie breaker is special cards (those with abilities) in hand. So it might be worth to not use a special card.

Only this. [thing=91514][/thing] isn't a game for deep thought, just plain fun.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Beautiful components;
- Easy to teach and to play;
- Good amount of interaction;
- Very short playing time, making the "take that" hurt a lot less (to almost nothing, except for the most competitive types);
- Language independent.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Several cards do the "take that";
- Very light on decision making;
- Has luck of the draw;
- People with the best dexterity won't necessarily win;
- Most young kids will have some difficulty with it, mostly because dexterity tends to be an issue the younger (or older) someone is, and also because the tower tend to get high enough for the younglings have problems reaching the top.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Learning that animals tend a not build the most stable buildings, and a heavy Rhino jumping on the floor doesn't help a bit.

[thing=91514][/thing] works in all accounts it should: light and uncompromised fun, while allowing for interaction for everyone poke each other at some point, but not enough for someone to get upset (at least for those without anger issues).

Very recommended.

A fun little "don't topple the thing you are building" type game. I think it plays best with 3 players so you have a chance to have more than one or two turns before the building falls.

I still have to be in the mood for a dexterity game, but Super Rino is certainly a fun filler. It is even easier to explain and faster to play than games like Animal Upon Animal and Cat Tower - just deal out the roof cards and take turns building floors. Most of the roofs have Uno-style actions on them, with the most funny and unique being the one that forces the next player to move the wooden rhino meeple to the upper floor. The game ends when the tower crumbles or one of the players has placed all of his roof cards. Nice game in which dexterity rightfully plays a bigger role than luck.

Maybe decent with kids, but not so much with adults. This game was over pretty quick and not much action. Unlike animals upon animals or dancing eggs, I am not entirely sure if this game is compatible with both adults and children. Still, I have to wait till my daughter is old enough to figure out if she likes it.

JENGA! Well, very similar to it. In this game, you place roof cards over the building and maintain it not to make it fall. It's super fun, simple, easy and full of laughter. The player who play out all his cards, win the game, or the player who collapse the building lose and the player with least cards in hand win.

This is a silly little game that I’ve been describing as a combination of Uno and “reverse”-Jenga. You’re building a tower out of cards (fun) and those cards tell you what happens next: play another card, skip the next player’s turn, switch the direction of play, or (the best) move the rhino hero to that card.

The winner is the person who gets rid of their cards first, alternatively the loser is the person who makes the tower fall over. This is a nice little filler that’s great to start or finish up a game night.

unusual climbing tower building game with colourful folded cards and small wooden rhino figure. Half a dozen card effects on floor cards laid between levels. Could become a classic with the little one. Up there with Diego Drachenzahn and Kayanak for most unique gameplay interaction. All brilliant stuff from the chaps at HABA.

update 2016: bumped up to an 8 as proved itself as a long-running fave. The roof card bonus/penalties add that little something etra to an already fun building game. Always enjoy this with Ted before school.

Really great, original kids game. The tower gets surprisingly high sometimes. Card quality is excellent, game takes only five minutes to play.
The game is more varied than Jenga and when the tower collapses, it does not make an annoying sound.

Super Rhino is much better than I had imagined. I had heard the praise for the title, but dismissed it as another silly dexterity game that I didn't need. I am happy to admit that I was definitely wrong, it's a fantastic game!

Taking turns playing floors of an ever growing high rise building, and sometimes forcing your opponents to move Super Rhino around is a lot more fun than it has any right to be. The game is helped by amazing graphics, filled with fun little details and colors that makes the high rise stand out.

I generally like dexterity games, so I rather liked Rhino Hero!  Other than the skip a turn mechanic I quite like how the card play interacts with how you stack your pieces and forcing people to tack the Rhino Meeple higher and higher on the tower is a good added bit of fun.  While I still would rather be playing Viva Topo, this is more portable and scales better so I might have to add a copy to my collection!

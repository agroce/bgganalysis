One of the better SPI offerings. The character only game is a fun way to start, then you can add military units and fight over one star system or the galaxy. A real star wars feel with some great characters. Planetary Stabiliser is this games equivalent of the Death Star...works by stopping the planetary rotation so the crust tears off. Nice.

This game takes several plays to warm up to and get the rules mastered.  My rating has gone up from a 5 to an 8 with reapeated plays.  It's got the old school wargame fiddliness, table lookups and a rulebook that has you jumping all over bring it down.  After several playings these become much more automatic and less hampering.  Working through the scenarios it was the third one where game started flowing.  Coincidentally it was also the same scenario where I won as the rebels.  

You definitely want to start with the smaller/easier scenarios and work your way up.  The Imperials can really hose themselves from the get go if they do their initial setup poorly.  But it takes experience to figure out how you should set up.

Making/downloading some player aids certainly helps game flow.  Some of the instructions and special cases are just plain difficult to internalize.

Definitely a story/rollplaying space opera.  The game does a good job of combining individual chacters with strategic gaming.  Reminds me of Tales of Arabian Nights in that respect.  You've got to be willing to take on the learning curve of the game engine, and rules that may have seemed clearly laid out 30 years ago, but now seem antiquated and poorly written.  However once you get past that its a very rewarding game.

Fantastic fun rip-off of Star Wars with heroic rebels and evil Imperials.

It gets a 9 because of rules problems and the very evident luck bias. (Many variant rules appear on the game listing, but most are really rules for different games that the poster's have envisaged).

Have spent hours of fun playing this both ftf and online.  I'd purchase a microbadge straight away if there was one.  Any microbadge makers around?

One of my all-time favorites.  I think the game suffered in ratings because of presentation.  Its a wargame, and will appeal to wargamers.  Its not a fast-furious sci-fi game.  It takes a while to play, but its not a monster like A World at War or my favorite World in Flames.The biggest problem with the game is that its too hard for the rebels to win in 20 turns.  We play the game as a 'timing' method -- play the game twice, on each side.  Play until the rebels win, see who wins first.  As a real strategy game, it is very, very good.  The rebels have a lot of choices that are hard to decide.  The early character protion of the game is lots of fun, and the endgame with armies is a nice finish.  As I said, its not a sci-fi game.  Its a great wargame in a sci-fi setting.  I can't think of another game that uses the domino effect like this does.  Do I coup quickly, or get characters?  It doesn't get a 10 because the game is really for the rebels to enjoy.  The empire is tedious.  Indeed, it may be best as a solitaire (where you have to make some rules for secrets).

AH Bookcase. Yeah, so it didn't get the Lucas 'Star Wars' lisence, but it saved us some money for what is a great game anyway... futile to hope someone'd reissue it with a Disney lisence as it'd compete with expensive 'SW: Rebellion'. So it will remain a cult favourite.

RATING: 6
Of the various SPI wargames that tried to meld a charater-based system with a standard wargame (War of the Ring and Swords and Sorcery being two others), this one is by far the best. A lot of very clever stuff, but of course it's too damn long. Still, a game that deserves to be updated and remade for the new generation of wargames.

I own this, but haven't been able to get anyone to play it WITH me. The rules are complex, bordering on arcane, but I love the IDEA of the game quite a bit (and I also love that many elements of these rules were borrowed for the Star Wars 'Rebellion/Supremacy' computer game). 

The setting itself is an obvious rip-off of/paean to Star Wars, but in my experience, the better an imitation is, the better it stands on its own (the 'Freedom Force' series of PC games is one example of this, and I think the FitG's setting is another).

RATING: 8.5
A thinly veiled Star Wars game, FiTG is, unfortunately, as about as close to a full-on wargame version of the Rebel vs Empire conflict in the movies as we are likely to get. This game was quite an achievement for its time, managing to incorporate both individual characters/spaceships with large units, firefights between individuals as well as battles between fleets and armies, and balancing the missions conducted by a handful of characters with campaigns to conquer worlds and solar systems.

It's got a few problems (SPI games of this era often seemed to have been never thoroughly playtested) but they certainly don't break the game and the system is amenable to minor fixes and house rules.

This is a grand strategic game.  While there are smaller scenarios, they are useful only for learning some of the game's mechanics; this game only comes into its own in the full strategic game, which unfortunately takes about 20 hours to play.

Of all the hex and counter games I own, this is the one I most wish would get a second edition.

RATING: 6
I'm not sure what to think of this game after 1 play.  We played the small scenario of just a single planet.  There's a lot of rules, but not many decisions.  But still, it does have a lot of theme.  My rating is based mainly on my desire to play it again.  If I had to rate the game based on this limited play, it would be a 5.  But I do want to try it again mainly because I think we may have gotten some rules wrong + the scenarios that incorporate multiple planets seem more interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Having only played the province scenario, I don't really have a complete picture of the real game. And by real game I mean the full galactic game. From what I understand, it would take 30  hours to play and it becomes a real juggling act... managing rebellions in various sectors and the domino effects involved. 

Even though on the macro-level the strategy may get really interesting, the minute-to-minute game play is pretty painful. Combat is grindingly slow and decidedly un-futuristic: typical add up combat factors and compare ratios. The mission resolution system is the real breaker: draw a certain number of cards hoping for a letter code that matches your mission to come up. More often than not you get the same random events again and again and again: being discovered by the eneny or fending off irate locals. Doesn't hold up, though nothing has yet replaced it successfully.

Well, I doubt many readers even know this game. Really fun with the character cards and chance to make systems rebel and such. I never ever set off a cascade as the Rebel faction. It's just plain imbalanced, and takes hours or days too long to ever be of interest in this day and age.

RATING: 6
This game is almost a good game. Certainly having Characters to play adds to the feel of the game. Tough rules though and given its length it is unlikely to be played very often. But its theme is pretty neat, the Characters that form the Rebellion are interesting and the Empire is very strong and is therefore a difficult but not impossible force to beat.

RATING: 6.99999
This Monster hybrid role-playing/war-game is a magnificent labour-of-love. Many SPI inside references such as  Drakir Greb (Rik[ch]ard Berg in a loose anagram). It is a sprawling, juicy, slyly comic ("Thysa Kimbo", hee-hee) multilevel blatant rip-off and loving  homage to Star Wars. The rules, as mentioned in almost every other review, are difficult to master, but I think well worth it if you do. I tend to forgive complicated and convoluted rules when the designer is going for something this big and novel and clearly spent countless hours in that pursuit. The "Kayn Mutiny"? Beautiful stuff here all over the place if you're willing to relax and go along for the ride. For an additional wild ride one can (with a few modifications) reverse the game functions of Secret Planet/Potential Rebel Base and throw the designer's intended flow of action merrily out of whack. It will send the characters on different routes and create alternate lines of activity in the Domino effect of attempted Rebellions.

It should be noted that this game almost certainly was not playtested as the Rebels have a MUCH harder time fomenting rebellions than the rulebook would lead you to believe but it's great fun nonetheless. There are several homebrewed play balance variants that attempt to achieve some level of parity; The Official AH variant by Nicky Palmer (no relation) published in the General Vol 20 # 4 is as good as any. Lot's of room for tinkering with this one.

I agree that there was potential here that was gimped by clunky rules.  In my opinion, this game was designed by fans of Star Wars that wanted to make a wargame based on the origional movies, couldn't get an official license, and ran with it anyway under a different name.  Apparently there was not much play testing outside their gaming group, since only the 'insiders' at AH could make heads or tails of the campaign rules.

The game plays just like everyone says it does; the most fun you will have losing, when it comes to playing the rebels. They have no chance in hell. Not even with Nick Palmer's fix do they have a chance. You just have a couple of more feel good turns where you're thinking, "yeah, they can do this,"

Forget it. Barcus, or Redjac will come in with a giant space armada, and the intrepid mission group will be getting prison-raped shortly. 

I have down-graded my ratings. How can a game be any good if it doesn't give one side a chance to win, ever?

It's a direct take on Star Wars, almost to the point of being liable to be sued for plagarism, however the game is a lot of fun, though how the developers ever got away with calling the Emperor's daughter "Thysa Kimbo", I'll never know.

From a gaming sense, the Imperial player rocks, but only in "la-la" land should the Rebels win anyway & there in lies the challenge & fun for them, the 20 characters they have available should try & stretch the Imperial player's 12 simply leaving the Imperial player nothing but violence as the response.

Wow.  So much of a game inside this box, a great sprawling masterpiece.  I am learning the slow way, going through scenarios.  So much going on, so many systems and planets, and choices.  My colleague and I are learning together, and so far we've really enjoyed playing and look forward to moving to the next scenarios soon.

If anyone has a pristine copy, ideally without pieces punched out, I would love to have it!

I bought this game when I was 12, and it took me nearly a year to digest the rules.  My friend Forest learned to play, and together we completed 17 turns (games lasts 20) over the course of about 3 months.  Each turn has five phases, and after weeks of practice we could get through one entire turn in a day.  At turn 17, we realized that our two forces didn't need to keep battling - instead, we simply opted for a truce, and allowed one another to exist in peace.

I don't think I've ever enjoyed a game more.  But I doubt I'll ever play a game through to completion.

I used to want this so badly when I was a kid and I'd see it in Kay-Bee.  Then it disappeared for a long, long time.  I finally picked it up on eBay just to see what it looks like.  Honestly, it doesn't look that great.  I don't know that I'll ever get around to actually playing.

Wow. Awesome game but time consuming and a bit complicated. A strategic imitation Star Wars galaxy finds the rebels fighting the evil empire. Really great artwork on the character cards. Cool board with many solar systems and planet environments. Individual ships, environmental combat specialist units, characters, equipement, politics, battles, it has everything.

Although FITG has just a single map and only 400 counters, make no mistake: this is truly a monster game. The smaller scenarios are just for learning; the full campaign is the only version worth playing... and the estimated 20 hours playing time is optimistic. Playing the full game is an experience unmatched by any other game. Missions conducted by small teams of characters, hand-to-hand combat, firefights, large scale land and space battles, and the destruction of entire planets combine to create a game experience of incredible depth. The rebels have little chance to win, but the game is so good that many players do not care, and there are several variants available that give them a better chance. SPI made many attempts to combine characters & armies in a single game, most notably with "The War of the Ring" and "Swords & Sorcery." With FITG they finally got it right. An awesome game to play! I have both the original SPI version and the AH version.

Star Wars as a wargame, with the serial numbers filed off. This game is actually an odd hybrid of wargame and rpg, with each side controlling key characters who go on missions, plus military units that engage in warfare. The chrome goes out of control and creates plenty of unnecessary complexity. I have played two partial games but never had the time (or interest) for finishing one.

I enjoy wading around in this monster of a game.  I've set up the Galactic Scenario several times but never really played it.  I've played the different Province Scenarios several times.   It helps to photocopy just one province so you can minimize the game's footprint on the kitchen table.  The problem with the game is the seeming impossibility of actually accomplishing missions.   It's incredibly hard to get the "D" diplomacy result in the Action Card draws in the succession you need to send an Imperial planet into rebellion.   After an hour of useless firefights with Irate Locals you just sweep all the chits back into the tray and put it away.    
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
The best of my $5 Kay-Bee specials from the 80s.  The game has a nifty feel where the Empire seems in total control for many turns, but the rebellion can erupt from a relatively small foothold and quickly spiral out of control.  The only problem with this game is that usually no one wants to play the Empire; I blame Star Wars.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
High on the want-to-play list, higher on the I-will-never-be-able-to-learn-this list. The sheer amount of sci-fi chrome is too impressive to ignore. This is the kind of epic created before expansions were the norm: all the detail and imagination went into the box at the get-go. It makes the thought of playing anything less than the full campaign game kind of lame; the problem of course is that the campaign game is a 25-hour opus.

The Rebels vs. Evil Empire theme is obviously remiscient of Star Wars, but Freedom of the Galaxy has its own flavor and backstory. Very, very complex game (on the par with Magic Realm). Players will spend considerable time learning the fundamental rules-- and then much longer learning strategies. You&#039;ve got everything in here: Suicide squads, planet destroying weapons, diplomacy, hunting for rebel scum, and the Rebel Secret Base. Game requires immense planning to use the most of your characters, equipment, and military advantages. If only the game did not take so long to play...

Bought it a few years after it first came out; many years ago. Never played ftf as no one around me, at the time, knew what to make of it. I was young and in my first real job (field engineer building EPCOT center) and I was boarding for two months in a hotel room that I shared with an old, eccentric, silent buzzard of a man who, no matter how many beers I offered to buy, would not play it with me. It stayed all set up for many nights. He'd kindly step over my solo attempt so he could chain smoke at the window. One night joining him at the window, our cigarettes burning and one more can of beer away from flopping for the night, he dropped his voice and confided to me that aliens visited our planet & it was best to keep quiet about such things. In broken sentences he explained. In detail.

When he finished we both turned to look at the game in silence for a few beats. 

Picture the background, a raw EPCOT Center rising out of the ground, steel & concrete. The big, naked geodesic ball of steel dominating.

I never finished the game.

What this game prompted from an odd old man gives this game it's rating.

One of my all-time favorites since trying to digest this behemoth as a pre-teen, the (justifiable) claims that this is a blatant Star Wars rip-off disguise the depth and variety of the game world represented.

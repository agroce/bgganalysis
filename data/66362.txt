Sweet spot is 3 players, with 2 players coming in behind that. Above 3, everyone has to be super judicious for their turns or it slogs painfully slow. Standard mid-2000s Alea components (read: cheap), and the iconography is *really tough* to make out in anything other than bright light (especially the market/festivals with those tiny numbers/colors). I generally enjoy playing (mostly because it's a novel combination of erratic turn order and tile laying), but something about it makes me go "oh, yeah... we can do that..." and as such, I never really suggest it. Lots of folks talk about the manipulation of the market as being an avenue of interest, but for some reason it's not a function that I find appealing in this game and I'm not sure why.

RATING: 8
This is a sophisticated, subtle, beautifully designed game-mechanic, wrapped up in an aesthetically rather unappealing package. Wooden resource tokens help a lot. It feels like a great multi-player solitaire puzzle. It doesn't outstay its welcome, although downtime can be a problem when a player chooses to take many turns in a row. The rules allow this but the player is heavily punished at game-end if they do this too frequently. 

There are many routes to victory so interesting strategies abound. The turn system is particularly interesting and enjoyable.

It makes a great solo game (using dummy players) - rules are discussed in the "variants" forum.

A really strong little Euro-game I think.

German edition.

LIKE: Simple engine building with tile laying. Fun to see which tiles come out next and trying to figure out combos. Many ways to score. Great turn order mechanism.
DISLIKE: Very fiddly, very dry, cube pusher. Knowing the different tiles in advance help players. Iconography is small. The game is starting to show it's age.

OVERALL: Meh. I should play this again and with more engaged players. I could feel a little tension when trying to block other players, and weighing different decisions. Unfortunately, hard to get to the table for the above reasons. (German version wasn't an issue.)

Because I constantly want to play Glen More, it really deserves a 9. Along with Notre Dame, this game has become my pick for an euro to fill a 30-40min slot.

2016-04-19
9->10
The fact that Glen More has been stood the test of time for five years and it still finds its way onto the table on a regular basis has earned the game a ten in my book. The game is almost free of negatives.

First off, I really like how many tough decisions you have to make. Every move is a trade off between two or more things, since choosing to go through a door makes others close for you. And this is really the thing I enjoy the most in boardgames. You can execute multiple different strategies, although one has to be flexible since there is enough randomness and chaos to keep things fresh. However, this fluctuation does not dominate the game and players have a good sense of control. Competition over tiles and money is fierce adding a thick layer of indirect player interaction.

There are only two little minor details that I can criticise. The first one is the game end. Since you know the number of tiles left exactly, the last round is not as exciting as the others. Basically you are only min-maxing the last victory points without the decision whether to invest on future potential or cashing out. The second point of criticism is on the visual appearance. It's functional but not as exciting as it could be. However, I really have to say that the aforementioned two aspects are really really minor and do not preclude me from rating the game a ten. There is plenty to ponder on the earlier rounds, and the game is not exactly an eyesore.

This is the game I try to get Carcassonne players to play.  A wonderful little strategy game that uses tile placements and different scoring tracks.  The clever bit is that scoring is relative to other players, so there isn't a single winning strategy.  Players have to watch what others are doing and adjust their strategy as they go along.

EDIT: Suburbia is surprisingly similar to this.

Very interesting game with the use of the track for time.  Play as far forward as you like, just be prepared to wait for the other players to catch up to you.  I also like the tile-laying aspect.  Provides a nice dynamic for activating the buildings and having to think about where different buildings should go.  I'd like to play this one more.

A fast placed tile laying game, a perfect filler. As the ruler of a Scottish Clan you have to decide which tile to take from a row of tiles, taking into the account the fartest tile you take you'll give advantages to the opponents as the round is always begun by the player in last position. So if you are to much ahead then you'll probably will be the last to choose from the leftovers. After you take a tile (field, brewery, castle), you will build it into your tableaux and activate it, giving you resources, bonuses, victory points. The most valuable resource is of course whisky. The catch at the end is that if you have more tiles than the others you'll be penalized, so you will always have to consider balancing. It is fast paced and fun, with minimum of downtime.

A solid Euro with a lot of mechanics I enjoy in games. The way you choose your tiles is like Patchwork and I really like this style. The placement rules are ok, there are some things to think about but generally not so difficult to put tiles where you want them. The point machine system and catch up is good, like a solid euro, the theme is vague and seems like I played a hundred games with similar theme before (like a lot of euros).

A more interesting tile-laying game than Carcassone, for me, because of the way tiles are drafted.  You can elect to reach for a critical tile but will then give your opponents several moves in a row.  The theme isn't incorporated very well, but any game even remotely about the highlands and whiskey production is going to be cool.  The scoring is a bit strange at first until you realize how important special buildings can be.

RATING: 8
Cool little tableau builder with variable turn order, a time track, and funky VP distribution just for kicks! I like it. Offers some fun spatial/tactical city building decisions. 

It resists being just 'multiplayer solitaire' with real tension in keeping track of what other players are doing so you can capitalize upon your differences for  determining income and avoiding big penalties at the end.

The others were more enthusiastic about this one than I was. Some have called the spacial element sort of frivolous (as in, it'll punish you if you're not paying attention to your clan member placement, but otherwise it's just annoying) and I can see that, but people do get dinged on where their meeples are. Also, it will reward players who make sure to set up for maximal activation of their juiciest tiles. I do find it annoying, but I figure others think that this is a key strategic element.

The tile selection is nice, and sort of self-balancing. People skip to the better tiles and then somebody else can "clean up" the worse tiles (at their risk, of course). My issue, though, is that so many tiles feel the same. They give you a cube of a certain color, or turn a cube of a certain color to points or whatever. I don't need a deep theme or something, but I really don't want to play something that's so purely cube-pushing. Blech, maybe it's just because the tiles are so drab.

Glen More is one of those unusual games that assembles familiar mechanics in a way that seems fresh. In this case it's Alhambra-esque tile placing, Thebes-esque turn order with the player who has taken the least time playing next, and you-name-the-efficiency-game churning of resources into vps. An interesting wrinkle is in the final scoring, which rewards the frugal Scot who has built his resource churning engine with the fewest tiles and penalises the tile-happy builder who has most despoiled the Highlands.

On paper, Glen More does not look at all my kind of game, but I've enjoyed my plays of it. My one grumble concerns the thinness of the tiles and the tiny text and icons on them, which is the same in both Alea and Rio Grande editions.

Anyway it is interesting enough for me to keep trying.

Quirky cube pusher.  Wish the theme were more integrated, or rather I wish for an entirely different theme with different and more descriptive art to boot.  The closest match I can think of offhand to it is UR, and I liked this a lot better.  Enjoyed the turn order mechanics, the puzzle elements, and the ghost dice for 3P.  I think 3P would be right around my limit because of the AP potential, though.  Would gladly play again, could see it being a 7 but hard to picture more.

This game is quite well themed for an abstract.  The Scottish theme is well done throughout the entire game, but it has very little to do with the game play.  Game play is a combination of a fancy rondel that is constantly changing and a tile laying game.  If these 2 mechanisms are of interest, this is a very fun game.  Game length is in the super filler range and of appropriate weight to match.  A good game to finishing a game night.

Absolutely lovely elegant mechanics. I was at first uncertain how much of the game was strategic, how much tactical, and how much luck, but the more I play it, the more I'm starting to see that by focusing on both the strategic and the tactical aspects, you can really make your own luck. The deeper game is in large part about jockeying for position, and getting the most benefit from what your opponents will ignore.

The game reminds me in some ways of Cuba: There's difficult decisions to make on where to place clansmen to allow most opportunity for both scoring and building in subsequent turns - but luckily it's not punishing you _quite_ so badly for making a wrong decision.

RATING: 5
On the surface, this game doesn't impress. The components are thin and the iconography very small... to the point it distracts away from the gameplay. But if you are able to move pass that, there is something charming and satisfying about this game. Mechanically, this charm is achieved in multiples way.

1. The rondel mechanism allows players to plan ahead while creating situations where players may be able to have several turns consecutively. But beware... taking too many tiles will lead to a strong end-game penalty. 

2. The marketplace can serve as an easy-source of coins/resources if timed right... but can also be manipulated to cut-off other players from resources they can't produce. 

3. The variable scoring is dependent on what other players have. Sometimes it is worthwhile to do something for the sole purpose of denying another player VP. 

4. There really seems to be multiple paths of victory and viable strategies. The best choice is dependent on when the tiles come out and what your opponents do.

5. The inclusion of the die, for 2/3-players, speeds up the game without adding much luck. In the end, you feel like the best player won.

A bit of Carcassonne tile-laying, with a little Thebes in terms of how the drafting works.  It's even got a simple little market in to boot.

I really love the idea behind a game where you get to build your own little section of the board, and that each piece you build can connect with the others to create interesting combonations.

I also really like the (slightly forced) balancing mechanism where players who take a lot of tiles, run the risk of being punished over those who are a bit more selective.

Egész ötletes játék! A lapkaszerzés módja is tetszik, és az, hogy milyen gyorsan pörög az egész (1 óra volt, pedig 4-ből 3-an most játszottuk először). Tetszik az a kiegyenlítő mechanizmus, ami a kevés lapkával rendelkezőknek kedvez, és ezzel egy érdekes dilemmát visz a játékba. (A mi partink egyébként épp ezen a szabályon múlt, végül a legkevesebb lapkás ember nyert.) Szerintem ritka, hogy ennyire rövid szabállyal ennyire komoly dilemmák elé állítja egy játék az embert. És hogy ennyi féle győzelmi stratégiát kínál. Kérdés, hogy a kevés lapkás stratégia nem túl domináns-e. Bár ha mindenki arra megy, akkor hatástalan.
A játék nagy hibája, ahogy már előre beharangozták nekem, a mérete. Tudom hogy nem a méret számít, de ez akkor is kicsi:)) Főleg a lapkák. A tábla meg pofátlanul puritán. De nem szabad a külső alapján megítélni, mert tényleg elég jó játék.
(Megjegyzés: Annak ellenére is tetszett a játék, hogy nagyon rossz állapotban voltam, amikor próbáltam.)

Really nice combination of tile lying and "last one chooses tile".  Also, the placement of the tile with the subsequent activation of the other tiles is quite original.  Quite a lot of scoring ways, which is done 3 times,plus final scoring.  Nicely ilustrated.

I love this game.  I don't know exactly why that is, but all of the mechanics just seem to come together to make for a great game.  Some tiles seem overpowered, but they're not always - I've just beaten someone who got Loch Ness before I could nab it - but that slight nagging doubt accounts for the missing half point.

Sometimes you encounter a game that's at the same time simple and complex, immediate and deep... and it is a joy to play. Glen More even scales well to two, with an ingenious 'robot'. It is definitely a gem I am glad to have bought and played, and hopefully it will see many many more plays.

Not exactly oozing with theme but the game is awesome. It scales well although can be quite different at the different player counts.  I like it with all counts but enjoying with 3-4 most at the moment - the more I learn the tiles the more fun this gets.  Downside of the game is that it is a lot more fun when everyone knows the tiles - then it is just masses of fun. As a side note this is my favorite roll and move game although its only the AI for the extra player in the 2/3 player game that moves.

Very excited Rio Grande might produce an English Language version.  I love Scotland!!!

Played at BGG Con.  Played with 5.  If you want to pick up the best tiles and have the best chance to win you will have A LOT of down time.  I'm talking Settlers length downtime.  Seems like AP could be really heavy with this game.  

Played again with 4 and then a third time with 5.  If the players are not APers, the game goes much quicker.  With 4 players we played in under an hour.  The last 5 player game was about an hour and a half and we discovered how easy it was to abuse the grocer tile with a couple of production tiles and Loch Ness.

Really enjoy all my plays of this little game. Smart tile/worker mechanism which sits alongside considerations about when to leap forward and take a tile and when not to. Take too many tiles and be too greedy and you won't do well, but leap forward too much and you'll be left in a sorry state.

First Play: Rules are quite straightforward but with some important elements that must be emphasised pre-start. Once begun, the game is quite intuitive and then reveals itself as something that needs a fair degree of forethought and planning. A weather eye must be kept open for what your opponants are up to and the possibility to stifle other players plans is always a good thing.

There seem to be killer combos with the cards that need to be appreciated and blocked to stop players taking advantage.

Second game and the importance of pre-empting the game end is crucial. 

A very impressive game

[b](just read the bold parts for my short take of this game)[/b]
I would rather do almost anything, than ever, ever, ever play a 5-player game of this flawed game, ever again.

I still probably wouldn't play it with less than 5, because I would be wasting my time on a game that really isn't worth the repeat plays relative to what else is out there that really earns my respect as a repeat play game.

1.) It has phased tiles.  That, by itself, is only mildly annoying and I don't normally fault a game for phased tiling if it's not done too over-the-top with people waiting for phase x because they know a special building is going to be there that they want.  I hate that, because the only way a new person would know that building is coming, is if they had played the game.  Homesteaders does this, and it's not too bad because normally it's only phased to keep things interesting within an engine.  Pelepones does it, but it's not too terrible, either.  Le Havre does it, but I really like it there because it's super gradual.

[b]Stacked with the random various 'tam' cards with random castles and special happy yippie-skippie win-me-the-game cards, I want to slap Matthias upside the head for requiring everyone to know what every card does before they play the game.[/b]  "Oh, there's a card that gives 2 points for every village?  MAN, that would have been nice to know at the start of the game."

[b]Yes, you can read what the cards do, but you still shouldn't be required to study a game in depth before you play it to have a chance at it. Even if you do study all the cards, until you play the game a time or two, you really don't know the implications of some of the special powers on the cards.[/b]

[b]2.) With 5 players.[/b]  Random buildings coming out every turn.  This is going to bring-out the analysis paralysis in everyone, and with 5 players, there's a guaranteed person at the table that when it gets to their turn, they're going to act like they just looked at the board 5 seconds ago and suddenly everything has changed.  

So you're looking at ~5 minutes a 'round'.  

Unless...

This has a mechanism where you select what you want by jumping ahead, and you can only go again when everyone else has caught-up and jumped ahead of you.  So, say you see something you really want?  How bad do you want it?  Do you want to wait 5 minutes before you take a turn again, or 10 minutes?  Yes.  Really.  

So eventually I catch myself going, "I do really want that tile, but I also enjoy actually playing a game.  Lets go with the closer one."  [b]I've never been punished by boredom for my game choices in a game before.[/b]

3.) If a new tile comes out that you do want, and you don't jump on it and suffer the consequences of boredom, you can kiss that tile goodbye anyway.  It's basically being railroaded into the next three available tiles whether you want them or not.  There's 5 players, and 8 tiles to choose from.  I assure you, that choice tile you want is going bye-bye.

True to form, take a look at the 'recommendations', and most do not recommend this with 5.   

I bet with 2 and 3, it might be a passable experience, but with 5, I've never wanted to slit my wrists to make a game stop before.  However, with any number of players, it's a fundamentally-flawed game that requires you to play it 2-3 times before you can really play it, anyway.

If everyone has tried it 2-3 times knows the cards, and it was only 2-4 players, it might be a pretty kickass game.

Nifty little game.

It's quite fast with little to no downtime... and I find it quite original (although I might not have played as many worker placement games as others on BGG so the originality comment is purely subjective).

I played this twice and always lost against my GF.

One thing I kinda don't like is the feel that some of the special buildings (lochs and castles) are overpowered compared to others. It's a bit like the big buildings in Puerto Rico...

A quick note for those scared about the presence of the die for the 2 and 3 players game: it's no big deal and simulates pretty well an additional player (that might or might not pick up a tile you wanted). My GF -REALLY- hates randomness and she never even thought about complaining about the die.

I may have to learn to just say no at a convention.  I'm in this habit of just kind of saying "sure I'll play whatever you feel like."  And what ends up happening is that I end up playing games like Glen More.  What makes it even worse is that the person who selected the game often is VERY familiar with the game and mops the floor with me, but that's a separate issue (I must admit it partially colored my view of this game, though.)  The biggest knock I have against Glen More is just the total and utter themelessness of the game.  I have a limit on the amount of boring themeless games I can handle and this one pushed me over the edge.

Now, to be fair the way that players run around the board snatching up tiles is cool.  And I like how this determines turn order.  Plus, strategic tile-laying is often right up my alley.  But trying to build a "machine" that can churn out victory points is just not even slightly exciting to me.  I want to fly in space, fight dragons, and other fantastical stuff.  Boardgames are a method of escapism for me.  I have no interest in struggling to grow wheat in order to brew whiskey, and raising sheep to sell wool at market.  Boring, thy name is Glen More, and I'm happy I was able to try it before I bought it.  All that said, some people will absolutely love this game, and I'll completely understand why.  Heck, I'd even play it again if it was with a group of rookies.  But it will never be one I suggest.

Hated it.  But, that was only one play with 5 people.  Way too much down time with no chance to plan because you really have no idea what the tile selection will be when it gets around to you.

Good game. One of those where there are so many ways to score it is difficult to work out who is doing well and who isn't. The placement conditions are fiendish to start with but quickly become less of a challenge. There are nice balancing mechanisms too.

Only complaint is that I am not too keen on the 'ghost player'. I would like to play with 4 to see if it is better without.

Update: Definitely better without.

Another update: 5 is good too.

This is, simply put, a great game. I don't tend to like heavier economic Euros, as they tend to be very AP-prone or very long. This one is neither, yet the experience is fulfilling and the decision space is large. There are multiple paths to victory - you can diversify or specialise. There is a fun and rewarding spatial element with chieftain movement and villages, and tile-laying. Despite appearances, close-out is very unlikely as there are multiple copies of each tile. And to top it all off, it has a limited but functioning economy and minimal luck.

I think this is the best Euro currently available.

There is a lot of tough choices packed into the less than an hour play time. It hits on a lot of keys for me. I like the tile placement and the choices presented by activating other tiles around where you place. I enjoy Thebes and like the mechanic where the player in the back gets the next move. The strategies around collecting resources you will need and the market are interesting. There are some interesting things in the scoring with the separation from the leader in a category and the person in last deciding points. Also the fact that you lose points if you’ve played more tiles than others brings an increased need for efficiency into the game. There is a lot to like going on. I’ve only had two plays but the first was good and the second was even better. We’ve only played with two and it’s great at that number. The dummy third player works well. I’m a little worried with the lower number of tiles to go around in a four or five player game, but look forward to trying.

// I picked this up after playing Kraftwagen. These games
have a similar mechanism for action selection and player
order. Overall, I like Kraftwagen more; this almost feels 
like too simple of a multiplayer solitaire game, and 
there's really no catch-up mechanism, so once you fall
behind, what's the point in continuing to play anymore?

I don't know what happened but I didn't like this game as much as I expected due to the average ranting here in the BGG. Maybe it was because we were only 3 players.

Traded away, 3 years later I played it in yucata.de and felt very happy because I didn't like it at all... it's a strange tiles laying victory point's salad.

Probably the best tile laying game I have encountered. Strategy has to adapt to changing tiles and the simple fact that you cannot count on getting any one specific tile. I like this randomness and it really makes the game a challenge. I suspect this will take many plays to really figure out good tactics, so it shall remain a dust free keeper in my collection.

The sort of Euro I loathe, a boring, abstract with a pasted on theme that doesn't connect to the mechanics. Then add in random, unbalanced tiles, overly long turns with no interaction (it's multiplayer solo) and I just wanted it over  and you can't accelerate the game as all you're doing is waiting for others to take more turns if you do that.

If I ever play it again I'll probably drop the rating further.

One of my favorite Euros in my collection.  I really enjoy the tile laying mechanic and the activating of the tiles in your tableau.  The turn order mechanic is neat and the dummy player/die in the 2p game is a breeze to control and does exactly what he should do with no fiddlyness whatsoever.   The game is light enough that my wife enjoys it, yet it has the depth to satisfy me as well.  All this in a 30 minute play time(with 2 players and once you know the rules).  I rate this an 8 but I bump it up to 9 because any game that lets you make whiskey deserves a +1 bump in my book.

A little more complicated '7 Wonders,' with the three ages/rounds of scoring moving from having mostly resources (#1) to more important buildings (#2 and #3) to maximize scoring. Difference between the two is that players can play the resource market in Glen More, rather than rely on neighbors, to gain coins or acquire resources that are not available; and players have to decide where to place the new tile to maximize production. Additionally, scoring is done in a handful of ways in both games, and in Glen More your opponents can increase your scoring in other areas by not advancing. Both games have open information in tile/card selection, but in Glen More it's more apparent, as the tiles are always open to view, where in 7 Wonders one does not know a card will come back around until the pass goes through all players. The dice 'player' for the 2 and 3 player games is the most innovative of any game including Alhambra that I have played. Just an excellent game packed into a little box and board.

Interesting new mechanics (market, auction, scoring by differences..) even though the core of the game uses mechanics from Carcasone and Catan. Big hit from an unknown designer. Just tried with 2 and loved "the 3rd player" by means of a dice. Could go up to a 9 when playing with more people.

RATING: 7.5
Very clever, interesting game, challenging enough to warrant multiple plays but short enough to be a filler. The dummy player works really well with two players, and I like the "time track" turn-order mechanic seen in Thebes, Red November, etc. My only complaint is that sometimes the tiles appear in the market in such a way that you cannot place them in your village, which can be frustrating. Otherwise, a great little game.

This is a much bigger game than the size of the box would suggest - there's a lot going on and some nice interconnecting mechanisms to grapple with without complex rules getting in the way.  It also has a nicely novel feel to it without necessarily being groundbreaking - indeed the 'brand new' element emphasised by the rules is, surprisingly, the turn order - which was previously seen in Thebes/Jenseits von Theben and Shipyard/Neuland (though, to be fair, if the game is a success, and it deserves to be, it will probably be played by many folk who've never heard played any of those games).  In fact the placement/activation rules feel like a fresher element - while there are similarities with other games I haven't come across anything quite the same.  My rating could easily be a point higher, though I would freely admit that part of that is down to the theming.  I'm hesitating only because the first game took longer than expected.  While my expectation is that, like many games, it will go a lot faster when replayed, the addition of an extra (new) player didn't speed things any on second play.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Great, simple and elegant tile laying tableau-builer with smooth gameplay, but yet very deep strategy-wise with many paths to victory (it feels light-weight but it plays as a medium-weight game).
++ I love the variable player's order turns using the time track (We must always strive to find the right balance between having great tiles first and the number of turns/tiles that we will have in the end, also while considering the excess tiles penalty).
++ Great, brilliantly simple and very effective dummy-player mechanism (for 2 and 3 players games).
++ I love the simple but fun implementation of the variable market of the ressources.
++ Good replayability due to random tiles order on the time track (especially the order of the third and last stack that are not all used during a game) and to variable player's turn order.
++ Good value, as all Alea title (component of relatively good quality, but great price point).
++ Relatively easy to teach, fast to set-up, don't take too much table space, and fast to play.


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- I wish there were more ressource cubes, to be able to populate the market with either coins or ressources cubes, since it's really easier to explain that you either take a cube and pay the coin(s) or you take the coin(s) and put back a ressource token (like Rahdo did in his run through).
-- To make it more thematic, this game could easily used animeeples and thematic ressource tokens instead of just cubes.
-- The end of the game happens quite fast sometimes (and abruptly) and thus we sometimes have a feeling of not having done everything we wish we would have done.
-- The replayability in 2-players games can be a bit lower, although still high enough.

Pretty cool middle-weight game with a bit of an engine  building feel to it.  As is typical in many Eurogames, you're producing cubes to turn into points and money here, so if you're not into that, you'll hate this.

However, I thought this was a pretty cool twist on the standard Euro-feel, and I pretty much always enjoy engine building type games.  It was also very cool to see that in our game, all the players were doing very different strategies, with the score very close in the end.  I really like that the game seemingly has a lot of routes to potential victory.

All in all, this game just has some cool mechanisms that while mostly unoriginal, come together to make a game that is quite good.  I look forward to exploring it more!

Slow to starts. Picks up at the end.

I didn't feel engaged with the tiles I was selecting at the start. 

Loch Oich over powerful tile. Need to check you can activate loch tiles on the same turn. 

Remember you can have multiple clan members on the same tile if you want. 

Early in the game, maybe not enough ability tiles to mix up the resource tiles. 

Maybe better with more people as you have to plan what tile to take.

I like the mechanic used here to pick your tiles: choosing the best tiles but leaving more for your opponents or chosing carefully but not always getting the best ones. Great decision making, theme/tiles colours are a bit bland though.

RATING: 3
I had the opportunity to play [i]Glen More[/i] for the first time at last weekend’s Unity Games convention and I found it to be the most disappointing game of the Con.  For what it’s worth, I think that Glen More might appeal to fans of [thing=27173][/thing] .  I rate [i]Vikings[/i] a [b][BGCOLOR=#CC99FF][COLOR=#CC99FF]_[/COLOR]5[COLOR=#CC99FF]_[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR][/b], however, and [i]Glen More[/i] seems intent on beating [i]Vikings[/i] at it’s own game.

The two biggest issues I had with Glen More are its solitary play and its funky round timing.  

The idea of the game is that players move their meeple around a circular, tile-filled track, selecting tiles and adding them to their own individual tableau.  Each time a new tile is added, that tile plus all surrounding tiles are activated (in the order of the player's choice).  For those of you who have had the chance to play [thing=65781]London[/thing], tile activation creates a fair bit of lonely downtime that is reminiscent of a player running a large city. The difference, of course, is that in Glen More this happens [i]for every player on every turn of the game[/i].  A typical turn might involve (1) staring at the board weighing options, (2) selecting a tile, (3) staring at your tableau to decide where to put it, (4) placing the tile, (5) activating an adjacent tile that produces wheat, (6) activating an adjacent tile that produces cow, (7) activating an adjacent tile that produces stone, (8) using the newly placed building to change the wheat into a whisky barrel, (9) activating an adjacent building to convert the meat into VP, (10) selling the quarry to the market for 3 coins.  

To be clear, my main complaint is not about downtime or speed of play.  My main complaint is that the game is solitairish.  The sense of isolation I had playing the game was merely exacerbated by the downtime.  While my opponents are playing, I wait, but I don't care.  They are stringing together a chain of events that I'm not paying any attention to.  Their hands fly into and out of the supply, coins enter and leave the market.  They could be cheating openly for as much as I can tell from across the table.  I probably wouldn't stop them if I could.  Rarely have I played a game where I had so little emotional investment in what the players around me were doing, yet had to wait so long for them to do it.

As for my second complaint, urns in [i]Glen More[/i] are taken on a [thing=30869]Thebes[/thing]-like system (the player in the back of the line goes next), but the game instills a penalty for taking too many tiles as a sandbagging disincentive.  The game has three scoring rounds that trigger when each of three stacks of tiles run out.  The combination of the turn order system and the round-scoring trigger means that a competitive player needs to constantly count the tiles in the stack and the spaces on the board to judge how many turns they will get before the next scoring (saying nothing about predicting how many turns their opponents might get by comparison).  Of course, being novice players, at least two of my opponents failed to count during the last round, and, because they had jumped so far ahead at a time when the round end didn't seem imminent, ended their game without realizing they had.  Of course, they didn’t realize that their game was over for about 10 more minutes (there’s that lonely downtime again).  If , like me, you are the player who is fortunate enough to be in position to take the last turn when your opponents make this blunder, you can spend even more time optimizing your tile selection to set you up for the scoring.  In fact, I won the game because I was able to use my last "turn" to take three turns in a row, rocketing me from a likely 3rd into a runaway 1st (with the help of an incredibly lucky tile draw).   Needless to say, that’s about as unsatisfying as a victory can get.

I have other, lesser gripes, as well:
- I didn't like that most of the game's tiles are about resource-management-like combos (that go with the theme), but that scoring is based on performance in three categories, two of which are primarily related to the resource-management side of the game only by being in direct tension with it.  Honestly, the resource bit was the only thing that initially seemed promising to me about the game, but, given its marginalization in Glen More, its inclusion only made me realize how much I wished I were playing a different game.
- I didn't like clansman movement, which was largely trivial and seemed to exist solely to trip up inattentive or unaware players rather than to provide any meaningful tactical maneuvering.   I enjoy a healthy spatial element to erstwhile economic games.  I don’t enjoy things like Agricola’s field adjacency rules that provide little to think about, but punish those who forget to think about them.  Glen More is pretty much that. 
- I didn't like the special buildings that provide wildly divergent special powers (my win was thanks to a last-turn special building that allowed me to activate every tile on my tableau).  As a general rule, [i]I hate special power combo building.[/i]  But, in addition to providing powers, the buildings are one of the three scoring categories, and they often provide bonuses in one of the other categories, making them appear incredibly valuable (at least to first time players). 
- I didn't like the scoring system, where all points are relative to last place.  When an opponent and I started a whiskey barrel arms race in round 1, it was kind of fun.  Then I realized that my production had absolutely no effect on him (we both finished with the maximum possible whiskey bonus), and that I could see no way to meaningfully interfere with his success in that area.  That was less fun.  
- I didn't like the minimalistic components.  The tiles are small, the money flimsy, and the cubes sparse.  At least it's a cheap game, but this is one of those things that would make me not want to own it.  
- The rulebook was horrific.  We had to refer to it often to scour for niggling rules hidden in small type, or in examples, or, in one case, in a concise summary of the rule that conflicted with the natural reading of the longer, detailed rule.  Another rule was open-ended enough that we had a relatively lengthy debate about what conduct was/wasn't allowed.

The whole experience would have been a giant drag, but was saved by the company at the table.   I played with a really great group of guys who seemed to take the lackluster session in stride. I can't see any redeeming value for me in Glen More, and it's the sort of thing that I'd likely need to be persuaded to play again, as the simple time and effort of playing far outpaces any interest it holds or entertainment it provides.  It's a [b][BGCOLOR=#FF6699][COLOR=#FF6699]_[/COLOR]3[COLOR=#FF6699]_[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR][/b] (FWIW, my highest one).

Bought this quite a while ago, simply because it was farming in Scotland, and without knowing any of the mechanics of it. I was more than pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoy this game. I'm still not sold on the little White dice acting like a little AI for a 2 or 3 player game, but I can let that slide. I like how you need to plan out laying your tiles out to maximise their effects, while looking out for end of round scoring. Very fun.

I *really* like this game after a couple plays. The trade-off between moving r=forward to get a valued tile and then waiting to move again, couple with the end game bonus/penalty for having a small Dorf fascinates me. Multiple paths to victors and some tile management too. Very good game for the money once it is available in U.S. Besides, any game that rewards getting barrels of whiskey while wearing black hats is on the right track.

I can tell there's a good game in here. The first play was a little overwhelming with the variety of tiles. I wasn't quite sure on how to win. I like all the activations of tiles and the variety of tiles, I just need more play to become familiar. I really like the turn order track, it makes for some difficult decisions.

RATING: 8
One of my favorite tile laying games, and the selection process for whose turn it is is well designed.  The scoring modifiers throughout the game (as well as the balancing mechanism for those with "uge tracks of land") are what makes this game very unique.

For those who don't like "economic engine" games, I think you may still like this one, as there is an "engine" aspect to it, but there are enough variables throughout the game that it won't be the primary focus.

Opponent screwage can also be a big factor in this game, so be aware that it can cause "issues" with your friends.  Not as bad as Diplomacy, but I get yelled at by my wife on a regular basis when we play, because I always seem to be the one to take that much needed tile that she so desperately wants.

Decent Euro resource gathering and tile laying game. Nothing awful, but nothing special. The pros for me are that there seems to be a nice range of avenues for victory, and there's some fun strategy in trying to figure out where to play tiles. It also plays quick.

On the other hand, the components are a bit bland, I didn't feel that choices were terribly tense, and there's not much interaction. Eh... it's OK, I'd play it again, but I won't be disappointed if I never do.

An okay tile laying game with a neat time track mechanic that plays surprisingly fast. I think the only thing holding this back for me was that it just felt fiddly for some reason. Too much resource juggling and clan movement to place a tile in my mind dragged this one down for me. While I was playing it I kept thinking I would rather be playing Isle of Skye if I wanted a tile laying game set in Scotland. If someone suggested this I would always suggest Isle of Skye first. For that reason this game is leaving the collection.

RATING: 6
Initial impressions after two plays, two player.  There's more to this game then first meets the eye.  For example, the game has a spacial aspect that is both surprising and hard to explain.  It's one of those game that you will play sub-optimally your first game, but immediately want to play again.

After our second game, my rating dropped.  It's not that the game is bad, it is a fine game and we expect to play it a few more times, but in the end it has very little "new" to recommend it.

Sadly the production values are below what we've come to expect from Rio Grande and its European suppliers.  The tiles are thin, really thin, and I say this as a wargamer.  It gives the game a cheap feel and makes it hard to pick up counters like the money and VP markers.

Quick tile laying game with meaningful decisions.  The turn order is basically a rondel mechanic meaning that certain players will end up with more tiles than others, however, you do have to pay victory points at the end for how many tiles you have, so you have to try to be economical.  Like Carcassone, the game is over once the tiles run out, so it never overstays its welcome, but it feels much less random than Carc.  A great next step game.

Rating based on one 2-player and one 4-player game. I actually enjoyed the 2-player game a little more than the 4-player game. If you are looking for multiplayer-solitaire, then this is the game for you. Still, much better than Take It Easy, which I rate a one.

I'm getting pretty jaded to most new middle-weight Euros. This is a fine game, and I enjoyed playing. There were even some novel concepts (well, at least not overused concepts....like the track-advance element from Tutankhamen).

But in the end its just one more game with meeples that plays in 60 minutes or so. 

I'd be willing to play again, and would enjoy myself. But I also see no reason to go out of my way to play it.

The love child of Carcassonne and Catan? Throw in a little worker placement. Add whisky. Definitely add whisky. This game is a tableau builder with multiple paths to victory, high replayability, and tons of other buzzwords. Don't mistake my flippant tone for dislike of this game. I like it. I like it a lot. I see little originality overall, except in that it combined great elements of other games into one tense little drama that lasts about an hour.

Nothing is "wrong" in Glen More. It is a not-simple but light entertainment, with a remarkable dose of luck that you should drive safe, and some final combo stage.
On the other hand, nothing is stellar and the combination of mechanics feels like very old and/or clunky.

Nice combination of the tile placement mechanism and economic management. I found it played a bit slowly, but that was probably because it was our first game. Would definately play again to see if it grows on me. 

The components are cheap, and I can't see myself getting this game until I have played it more AND they release a version with better components. 

12/4/13 - Upgraded to 8 on second play. It deserves higher than a 7. It is a solid game.

I wanted to like this, but the first run through was kind of lackluster.  Part of this may be due to the instructions, which were kind of crummy; we kept finding new rules throughout our play.  If I wind up playing again, knowing more of what's going on, my opinion might improve.

Sort of like worker placement in reverse, in that you have the worker there and place the action tile next to it.  Cool.  The "last in line goes first" player order is nice, as is the die usage for 2 & 3 player games.  The tile placement next to a meeple reminds me of Maori and some other clever tile laying games.  It's the scoring in this game that's a little wonky.  Love it!

Some refer to this as a rondel, but it's clearly not.  A rondel brings you back around to the same options, where this one is a line of tiles that just happens to be laid out in a circle.

This new Alea small box showed up halfway through the Gathering, in preproduction form. This seemed to get generally, but not uniformly, positive feedback. To me it felt like the action selection from Shipyard, plus the building aspect of Alhambra. I'm sure there was a theme in there somewhere, but it's a little thin. Especially one of the primary scoring conditions, which is collecting fewer cards than other players. Our table had some major concerns over whether the game was balanced, in terms of the different things that score. Not sure how much that had to do with first game syndrome. But the argument seemed to make sense. Much less luck-heavy (and infinitely more pronounceable) than the previous game in this line, Alea Iacta Est. The only luck is the order that tiles come out, but there's a fairly big opportunity cost to jumping way ahead to a tile as soon as it comes out.

RATING: 6.5
4 plays: 8.5 - all two player
7.5 plays: 7.5 - all two player, the luster is fading.

Interesting mechanics with turn order, and tile penalty, but not as much fun as I had hoped. I think I prefer tile laying games where the tiles are the focus rather than focusing on resources as is required here. Haven't tried teaching it, but I think it would be tricky. Experienced players would have advantage of knowing types of tiles and special building to expect.

Glen More was more or less a researched impulse buy for me. I spotted it at a local game shop while on holiday, glossed over some reviews (a little too carelessly, I’ll admit that) and when opportunity presented itself some weeks later, purchased the box at a fair price. Now although I did know about some ‘cool’ turn order mechanism (which, as it turns out, was already known to me from other games) and some tile laying, what I didn’t know was that Glen More contains a resource growth engine. As luck would have it, the engine is fairly simple and straightforward: there are at most two levels between obtaining raw resources and gaining VPs, and in the vast majority of cases there is in fact nothing in between these two (although they do constitute separate actions). The difficulty is far more in the topological restrictions deciding which actions can be activated. This makes the engine easier to grok. Another thing which helps is that stronger actions tend to come out in the last part of the game, but at an uncertain time, so players are not easily left in the dust by more experienced gamers.

Now if you are looking for a clever resource building engine where you can do what you want whenever you want (go slow now, go fast at the end; or the other way around; or ...), and don’t need the game to introduce some breaks because your fellow players are quick on the uptake of subtleties in the engine speeds, then Glen More is not for you. Simple as that: you will find it trite and simplistic. But for the likes of me, Glen More is really not that bad, perhaps even fun. The random tile draw means that players need to remain flexible whatever their chosen path and cannot settle down in fixed unbeatably efficient paths; the fact that for three rounds a [i]relative[/i] scoring takes place is a nice way of forcing players to keep up, or to slack off once the difference becomes too big. Of course knowledge of what is in the draw stacks will help you plan better, but still the need for flexibility must not be underestimated.

Speaking against Glen More are downtime at high player counts, difficulties in assessing what tiles are good for other players (as looking at someone else's little area is not easy), and a rather solitary nature. The efficiency of your engine is distilled into a few basic parameters, so you notice each other there; and of course tile track and market are the other sources of interactivity. Don’t expect brilliant gaming patterns or on-the-spot brinkmanship or whatever: you’re going to play a significant part of the game solo. 

Since I own very few resource engine games, and dislike squeezing every bit of efficiency out of them because that is what they are all about, Glen More is for the time being sufficiently likeable for me to not be regretting my purchase. I'm putting in a low rate, but if nothing funny happens I expect the rate to climb.

[b]Update[/b] Increased the rate. This is a solid little game, at least at the lower player end.

Really enjoyed my first play - can really tell that there are things you're doing wrong, as you're doing them. Keeping track of future tiles, not only what's in your opponents tableau, but where his meeples are, etc.

For example, if there's a key river tile that you want, but you think he might take it, make sure he can actually place it. Because if you make play X so that he won't steal, but he could actually steal because he couldn't afford or couldn't place, you're just screwing yourself.

Decisions like that throughout - nice balance of spacial planning and efficient resource manipulation. Enjoy this more face to face than on Yucata.

I've started playing this on Yucata as it was suggested to me as a game I would enjoy.  And indeed it is.  Takes a little bit to wrap your head around the scoring and activation, but otherwise a delight.

In this tile-laying game, players pick up one tile per turn, then placing it adjacent to a tile with a villager.  The tile then "activates" all adjacent tiles, which can help you collect resources or earn victory points.  Resources can also be bought and sold in a limited market.  The game also uses the classic "last shall be first" model of turn order.

The key here is scoring is based on a few factors - but specifically on how you compare to all other players, which provides the interactivity.  So for example, letting one player run away with a lot of whiskey barrels is NOT a good idea for anyone but him.  Get thee to a distillery!  This game is good fun and family-friendly.  It offers just enough strategy to make me scratch my head but plays quickly.  I need a copy.

I like: the spatial puzzling of your territory layout & activation (so long as people are willing to play without taking too long on "where will this tile go?"), the market system (nice method of indirect trading), and the points penalty for using more tiles than the most frugal player - it provides a nice counterpressure to hoovering up as many tiles (and thus activations) as you can manage, which in turn makes it more worthwhile to jump ahead to get the just-right tile, which in turn makes the time-track system more interesting.

I dislike: the length of the time track (feels too short - I want more lookahead), the downtime between turns with more than 3 players, the incredibly tiny icons/text, and the sometimes-unintuitive iconography. (When do goods need to be different vs. the same?) I also found the placement restrictions of (clansfolk) + (river/road) a bit irritating - either one alone would have been fine, but together crossed over the line from "interesting constraints" to "annoyance", particularly in concert with the limited lookahead on the time track.

The theme is as usual medieval, but the game is nice euro engine building. With tile placement mechanic and somewhat variant of thebes's turn order mechanic, the game really shines with all its cohesiveness. The interactions is simply elegant. In addition of tile snatching, the game has built in interaction of scoring mechanic, in which we score the differences of with player who has the least in each category.

There's something about Scotland that just sparks my interest(maybe Haggis and Backpipes?)...well.....the United Kingdom actually...so I had to pick this up.

I mean all that whiskey and we just keep it in storage? Oh...wait....there's a Tavern...there we go....booze for the masses.

Nice economic game that plays in a short time and has enough strategy to keep you going. If you like eurogames you would most probably enjoy this one.

Components: Clear iconography (except the tams look like little sea shells). Would have preferred individually shaped wood over cubes, but I guess I can borrow from my Agricola set.

Experience: An interesting decision on every turn. There is a huge selection of tiles, many places to pick from, and different sequences in which to trigger my abilities. Each turn is a puzzle to be solved. The market fluctuation is a cool mechanism, and allows me to try to strategically block my opponent from buying/selling a good.

Glen More is an interesting game.  At first look it seems to be a lot of game in a small box.  I also like that there is the possibility for solo play.  It is not bad to teach, and I think the tile laying would make it a good gateway game.  There is competition for the tiles, but there is not an in-your-face component of playing in the same tile area.  I need to try this one some more final judgement, but it looks to have a lot of potential.

RATING: 8
Players develop their fief in Scotland, laying tiles with villages (to attract more "workers"), agricultural land (producing grain, sheep and cows), industries (meat and whisky to gain money, stone quarries)...With these resources one can build castles giving special abilities or gain access to Lochs with special abilities. There is also a market where you can buy and sell the resources you're lacking or have too much of. To score points you have to develop as efficiently as possible, because in the end the players with more tiles than the player with the smallest amount looses points. There are also three scoring rounds in which the difference with the player scoring lowest for number of whisky barrels, number of castles/lochs, and number of clan chieftains ("workers" that don't work anymore) determines how much you score. So, one always has to keep an eye on what the other players are up to.
The player who is in last position on the tile track always gets to choose a tile (some are for free, others you have to pay for). The tile has to fit to the ones you already have (river, road, land) and can only be placed next to a tile where you have a "worker". Each time a tile is placed, the adjacent tiles are activated. Careful planning of tile placement and "worker" placement is thus necessary. But then again, you never know whether you're going to be able to get that tile you want to create a powerful combination.
Some of the special tiles (castles/lochs) seem to be overpowering, especially considering their relative cost.
But all in all, this is quite a challenging and fun game.

Decent tile placement and resource management game that, like so many other euros, feels mostly like an amalgam of two or three other games. It does have some unique mechanics, though, so that kept me interested.

The downtime can be a bit much if you jump ahead on the track. I've tried it with 3 and 5 players, and I had several opportunities to walk away from the table, get some food, and come back without missing, well, anything. Some denial is possible (and required if you don't watch out for the wheat/distillery/tavern combo), but it's mostly multi-player solitaire.

RATING: 7
The usual "build resource engine & get points" heart, but in this case players select and place tiles into thier own tableaux with the placement triggering tiles around it. ie, Good tileplanning is critical. An elegant mechanism ensures players who choose the better tiles get fewer turns (less tiles) so there's some nice decision tension there. However, this mechanism also leads to significant downtime if you've taken the good stuff. I usually find myself taking lots of crap because I can't stand the boredom of leaping ahead, then waiting. I also dislike that the main VPs are the usual "who has most X" with its typical problem of providing a boost to players on find themselves on a lonely path. At least the game also has a way to steer your game onto the lonely path.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's your basic multiple-paths-to-victory euro. Collect resources. Certain resources enable you acquire tiles that help you along Path A; other resources lead to tiles that help with Path B, etc. However, the tile placement restrictions lift this game above the average such euro. You want to place each tile so that the most useful previously-placed tiles are re-activated, and there's the rub. You finish every game thinking you could have built a more optimal village of tiles.

I really love the player-turn mechanic in Glen More and think more games should use it. It definitely takes awhile to wrap your head around the strategy/gameplay and it's better played with everyone at the same experience level. For a minimal components, the theme comes through quite well.

There are hints of Puerto Rico here, but with a nice timer to it.

The special cards are one of my few complaints. There are a couple super-powerful ones that can change the game. The other is the penalty for having more tiles than others, which to me sort of ruins the player-turn mechanic. Hanging back to get more tiles can't really be played as a full-on strategy.

Need to play more.  Tough to find in the United States.

Needs a couple of plays before the subtleties start to sink in.  I love that fact that more tiles vs. your opponents is negative points at the end of the game.  It forces you to be efficient, even if there are some easy score chances due to your place in the turn order, you have to weigh that with having more tiles overall.

Dude, this guy's mullet rocked in highschool, back when mullets were cool and he was the coolest.  I once saw Glen drink a gallon of milk and then swallow a tablespoon of cinnamon right after, just on a dare.  He was the best.  Too bad about the accident, really.  At least they named this game in his honor.  Though unlike Glen, the game is very well balanced, and stimulating intellectually.  Glen was more about being the life of the party and getting laid, which I'm pretty sure this game could never do.

I liked this one, but then I do like the Thebes turn order system they use here as well. You can pick a tile far ahead but then you probably will have to wait for your turn for a while.

RATING: 5
Nice tile collection game.  Seems that some tiles are overpowered, but the game still works.  This is mainly because turn order is determined in the Thebes fashion.  Want that valuable tile as soon as it is uncovered?  Jumping way ahead on the track to get it means forfeiting a lot of moves.  Will be curious to see how it hold up with repeat plays.

Update: After a 6 year break, it got to the table again.  Lowering a couple of notches (7 to 5).  This game has not aged well and is bad with 5 players.  Keep player count down to 4...3 would be even better.  Otherwise..way too much downtime.  And you better have good light to play this game, otherwise very difficult to tell the difference between cube colors on the tile.  Some of the smallest iconography I've ever seen for the bazaar tiles.

Glen More, by Mattias Cramer, was another surprise out of BGG.Con for me, a light game that combines both an interesting time mechanism, a zero-sum market, and an innovative tile place mechanic into a solid, broad game that allows for multiple strategic options yet rewards opportunistic risk taking.

The second thing a player does on their turn is place a tile into their area. I am going to explain it first, however, because it provides a good deal of context for the first part of a player’s turn. In order to place a tile into their area, the player needs to meet two criterion: first, the tile must be placed in such that it is adjacent to one of their clansmen meeples; second, the tile’s side features must match those on the board, with the only features of real note being a river that moves north and south, and a road that moves east and west. As the tiles are placed, the owner pays for the resource requirements of the tile either by removing those resources from their board or by buying them from the market. After the tile is placed then that tile, and all adjacent tiles are immediately activated, thus producing resources, converting resources to victory points, allowing the movement of clansmen, or whatever else that particular tile does. In general, tiles can only be activated when new tiles are placed adjacent to them, thus making the order of tile placement, and the movement of the clanspeople very, very important.

The first thing a player does on their turn is to move their meeple along the time track that circles the central board area, moving it to a tile, then taking the tile and adding it to their overall board. Then the player whose meeple is closest to the back of the time track can move their meeple to take a tile. If the same player who is at the back of the line stays at the back of the line then they are allowed to take multiple tiles in a row. This has a number of interesting implications, both because by getting more tiles you have more opportunities to activate your tile set, but also because individuals lose victory points at the end of the game based on the relative size of their tile set, with larger numbers of tiles causing a bigger victory point loss.

Victory points are awarded based on resource conversion tiles that are acquired during play, as well as relative majorities of whiskey barrels, chieftains (retired clanspeople), and bonus cards (acquired by taking castle or loch tiles). Points for majorities are scored three times during the game, with a relative amount of parity available between all of the different scoring options; it seems quite possible to combine victory point generation in all sorts of ways and still pull of a victory.

I found Glen More to be fairly clever and entertaining at first but further exploration showed it to be just as shallow as most lighter games. Helvetia (also by the same designer), had a similar lack of depth so I may avoid him in the future.

Glen more is quite a unique small deeply dents game. All the decisions that can be made and mechanisms are quite interesting. It looks like a Carcassonne clone but it is not. A much deeper euro with an interesting puzzle mechanic and a action selection and turn order mechanism unlike anything I have seen. It is quite enjoyable and I would like to see this mechanism used in other games. Overall Glen more is a wonderful small but deep euro.

Players are Scottish lairds in the 16th century, trying to expand and work their land holdings.  Mechanically simple game, where the player trailing on the action track takes the next turn (think Jenseit von Theben's turn order mechanic), advancing their pawn as far as they like and claiming a land tile to add to their holding.  The placed tile activates for some sort of ability, as well as every adjacent tile, setting up a nice puzzle of where to position tiles for maximum benefit.  Added restrictions, related to your meeples, add to the decision tree.  Tiles typically produce stuff, move pieces or mince stuff into victory points.  Three scoring rounds award extra points for having chiefs, special holdings and whiskey barrels.  So we've seen it all before, but rarely in a nice tight package with simple, intuitive rules that asks some nice questions of the players.  Enjoyable.

Combines a timing rondel, tile laying, and resource/engine building in an interesting fashion, although maybe not interesting enough to have longevity.   The Alea production is amazingly cheap, with cube shortages and tiny, tiny icons that are very difficult to ready when right in front of you.   Ugly too.   There is enough thinking on one's turn to make that part interesting, but you can't plan too far ahead.  The end of round timing can bite you unfairly also.   There is a challenging game here, no doubt but I think it could have been done better.   After one play, I feel like I understand the tile mix better.

I myself like the scoring mechanics. The way it works is rather unique. Player try to score in three different categories (number of whiskey barrels, number of chieftains and tam hats, and finally number of special buildings). They sum up the total in all 3 different categories respectively and compare them with the player who has the least in each category.

With the difference you get, you refer to the scoring table and get that many points.

Also, at the end game, players with more tiles than the players with the least, are required to deduct 3 VPs for each differences. This I think is good to not promote the runaway leader, and to encourage players with less VPs to do some catch-up

Another thing to admire, is the turn order mechanics, People say that it is somehow a little similar to Thebes. If you choose to jump too far, especially to grab tiles that you want the most, your next turn will be late. 

BUT! I have only one gripe, and it can be huge for a person like me. The components! Come on Alea, you can do better.

rather paste on theme euro about being a scottish land owner. I wrote a review. In short if you like euro games about collection tiles and moving meeples around you might like this. The only major positive about this game for me, was that due to the random appearance of tiles you can't determine your overall strategy after the first turn.

Glen More is a big game in a small package.  I've enjoyed my initial games and look forward to playing more.

Lots of game for a good price.  Feels polished.  Multiple paths to victory.  The deal breaker for me is the turn order mechanic similar to the one found in Thebes that is certainly clever but suffers from serious downtime when you jump forward and have to wait for others to take multiple turns before yours comes around again.  Admittedly, I can be unusually sensitive with downtime in some games and this was one of them unfortunately.  The artwork is dreary and the board, font, and icons are obnoxiously small.

Holy crap this box is stuffed full of game.  I wish this was  a big box game with a better board, bigger tiles with larger symbols, etc. Ok, on to the game!

This game is surprisingly complex for its ruleset. In a nutshell the game is an engine builder with a spacial element that also rewards efficiency (end game subtraction for all but the smallest boards). It's clear to see there's a lot of strategy to explore the game, and I'm looking forward to more plays.

This has all the makings of a good euro. It's very well balanced - the minus VPs per additional tile and scoring by differences is genius. It's simple to learn with minimal moments of AP, yet with multiple victory paths and delicate decisions to make. And finally, it's one of the few euros with a very nice theme implementation.

Picked up a few micro games today and was thinking about how this game could easily fit in an envelope (maybe 5x8").  So much fun in such a few bits.  Some of the many things to like:  tile selection process; resource market mechanic; tile placement strategy;  and balance of points accumulation.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
[2 plays] I think a common problem with a lot of current games, or with the teaching of those games, is that because the game involves a lot of resource conversion, what you spend most of the game doing doesn't really directly help you at all in winning the game. Thus it's easy to have your attention engaged by the main activity and only notice when it's too late that you haven't actually done the thing that counts for victory. 

So if you play a few times, you get the hang of it and can play more interesting and strategic games.  If you just play once and move on, you have a string of weirdly frustrating experiences.

All that notwithstanding, Glen More has its merits. I like the way the scoring works: instead of the typical game where you're maybe thinking it's hopeless to catch up with the leader, in this game you can be the worst player in the game, and if you do something to help yourself, it directly drags down everyone else.  That's pretty good.

I am quite bad at this game, but it's very intriguing! It also took some time for me to warm up to it. And I think you have to play it a few times because it's important to know what's coming up in the later stacks.

[i]Edit:[/i] I got much better at this game and it is absolutely amazing. There are many things you have to keep an eye on, but figuring out what you have to focus on in a particular situation and what you have to let go is sooo much fun.

I love the element of time in games a la Thebes and Tinners Trail, so it was with great surprise that this game did not appeal to me. I've only played a couple of times, but I found the game lacked a certain something. I found myself not caring about building my "city" nor what the other players were doing. I'm sure I play plenty of games that others consider "soulless euros" but that's what I thought of here; isolated and uninspiring.

The time element didn't click for me in this case b/c it would take others so long to select their tiles and place them that downtime became a prominent issue. I found myself ignoring tiles down the line for fear of how long I'd have to wait. I also didn't like how you can count the tiles in the stack as a means of predicting when the next scoring round will come. I find that type of thing taxing and annoying and refuse to do it. The spatial element of the tiles seemed more annoying to me than fun, and in any case, it slowed everyone down as they wanted to make sure they didn't screw themselves with a bad placement.

I did not do well my first play...seems I was chasing the wrong stuff constantly. Perhaps we play again soon? On subsequent plays I did better, but it is very easy to fall prey to simplistic goals.

I like engine games like this, and the tile selection mechanism is fairly unique (you can jump ahead to get a really desirable tile but you'll give up turns to your opponents).

I got this cheaply at Essen 2011 and I was pleased with the purchase for the price. Largely a multi-player solitaire (MPS) with no direct inter-action (not my thang), you build an optimal arrangement of tiles, and try to trigger multiple scoring actions as often as possible. The building requirement of needing an adjacent clan member is a nice restriction, but I was frustrated by the turn order and randomness of tile drawing meaning I often missed out on the tile I needed. Still, it was fairly good for what it offers, and simpler in result than the very long rules presaged. The game is nicely structured by design, but it's another tight MPS and they don't spell FUN for me.

An interesting and unique take on the tile laying genre, with a basic economic focus, Glen More is a moderately entertaining and relatively accessible game for two to five players.  I have yet to play a game with more than three so far, and it seems that four players is the sweet spot, but I've still found the game to be generally a good time, with a moderate amount of depth to it.  The player is given a fair amount of choice in how they develop their clan's economy, and I really enjoy the trade-off in being able to jump ahead of the competition to grab a really desirable tile, but then having to suffer the consequences of losing a few turns while the other players catch up on the track; I also like the related concept that you are rewarded at the end for being "efficient" and not overdeveloping your land by building too many tiles.

The game seems to go by rather slow however, despite rarely lasting more than one hour.  There's also no player interaction, and I've never felt particularly excited or invested in the game, which makes winning or losing far less engaging.  Not a personal favorite of mine, and I feel it has kind of a limited shelf life (though, perhaps a few four or five player games will change my mind), but I can't say I haven't enjoyed the game thus far.

     I enjoy tile & resource games, of which this is a very nice one.  It comes in a modest box that fits easily on the shelf.  Lasts about an hour and the rules are not complicated although, as my friend pointed out, looks as though a non-English speaking person translated the rules. Although the box appears low-key, I like the graphics on components very much.
     I like the mechanics of placing the tiles including the river restriction, activating tiles, upgrading goods, and scoring.  
     A refreshing game I am anxious to play again.  Others playing the game enjoyed it as well.
     Two equalizers to reign back those who get too far ahead in the game make it a good family game.

This game exceeded my expectations, offering some interesting bits I've seen in other games in one fairly elegant, albeit themeless, package.  The "time as a resource" mechanism from games like Thebes, the spatial tile placement, the goods collection, and the many different ways to collect points all combine to form an engaging experience that feels somewhat unique.  The decision of which tile to collect each turn can be agonizing in and of itself.  I really like the way the meeples on the board can be used for two conflicting purposes: keeping options open for where to place future tiles, and being moved off the board to score extra points as chieftans.

I really rate this game.  It's very compact for a strategy game, quality components with great art work.  gameplay is simple and there are numerous strategies to pursue.

For whatever reason I've found this simple enough game incredibly difficult to teach.  The amount of times I'm asked "Can I put this tile here?" or "Does this activate here?" after repeatedly explaining the somewhat simple rules is boggling.   
I guess that for this reason about 50% of people I've played this with absolutely hated it.  The rest really liked it.  
To me this really is one of those love/hate games.  unlikely that I'll get to play this much.  Ultimately I had to trade this one away.

Essentially an optimization game, where the limited interaction comes from others snatching tiles before you. My only play was 5-players and in this configuration, the tiles disappear very quickly and you have next to no ability to plan from turn to turn. Moreover, the luck of the draw can be important as it's not a bad move to jump ahead quite a bit to grab a powerful castle.

Talking about castles, these appeared unbalanced to me as they give you two scoring resources: chieftains and special cards.

All that said, there are a few things I like about the game and I'd gladly give it another go, which may change my rating.

Aránylag egyszerű rondellás lapkagyűjtőgető és lerakosgató játék. Jópofák az épületek, képességei, ötletes az aktiválás menete. Gyors, szinte bárkinek megtanítható. Talán lehetne kicsit tematikusabb. Olyan kockamenedzselés érzése van menet közben az embernek. Persze egy-két menőbb ábra  vagy meeple sokat dobna rajta.

RATING: 6
In Glen More, players each build a landscape from tiles collected from a common pool. Those tiles kind of construct an economic engine but much of the effect usually associated with engine-building games is mitigated by how the tile-laying works. You cannot build wherever you want and to actually use previously built tiles you need to activate them by placing new tiles next to them. That makes it quite a bit more forgiving than other entries in that category.

While Glen More is thematically a game about whisky, that is only one of the avenues that can be pursued. Several paths to victory and some neat mechanics (not all of them new or unique but nicely executed) make it a pleasant game. That the only means of interaction is to snatch away tiles other players might need is a bit of a letdown, however.

Mit GLEN MORE werde ich einfach nicht warm. Nicht, dass ich es nicht mag, aber auch nach mehreren Partien bekomme ich das Spielgeschehen nicht geregelt. Jedesmal stolpere ich durch die Highlands wie Glen Greenhorn. Ich wünschte, ich würde mit dem Spiel noch wärmer werden und könnte es besser spielen, als ich es tue, da ich sowohl den Kreislauf-Kaufmechanismus als auch Matze Cramers Kreationen als auch Schottland mag. Allerdings kommt der Kreislauf-Mechanismus in KRAFTWAGEN noch einfacher und damit originärer. Schön ist, dass sich GLEN MORE recht zügig spielt. An der Pappe hat Stefan Brück wieder einmal gerne gespart. Ab 40 bitte Lesebrille mitbringen.

Good game. Choices of when to lag and when to take the big leap for that special tile remind me of Egzia with more nail-biting. AP players can bog things down. I really suggest Chess rules - take your hand off it and that's your move. Plus no rewinds for "Oh! I should have done this". Of course this means that the next player does have to wait for the previous player to say "Done".
Note: will not be a popular game with the "cult of the new" types as not enough bling for them - so unlikely to get the required number of plays to investigate the strategies.

This game has variable turn order, dynamic economy (prices for items change due to demand), interesting decisions, and nice combos.

Glen More is a mechanically rich game that can be played in a short time, in a small table. It overlaps with [thing=122515][/thing] a bit, but who cares? Both are great keepers to me.

 Never heard of this game before. Didn't really get sucked in by the theme (resource management in Scotland, 1300s). Gameplay started off a little slow and simple, and I didn't really get the appeal. However, Glen More really picked up by the mid- and endgame. The resource track and warehouse mechanic is fresh and a very neat way to manage player interests and balance resource acquisition. The rules governing territory building were also solid and it was enjoyable to figure out ways to become efficient. I was happy to see some new ways of playing a resource management tile game - a genre that has been thoroughly worked - but the designer, Cramer, got a bit more sweet juice out of it! Unfortunately, the theme feels sooo tacked on (even more so than your standard Knizia) that it makes this game feel relatively abstract.

I played this game years ago and really liked it and have only recently played it again since getting into modern boardgaming and man did I enjoy it.

I love the way the tile selection is done with the last person on the track being the one to select. There are various resources and the way you place tiles on your board and procing them is so good.

The pacing in this game is also excellent with multiple scoring rounds and more powerful tiles coming out later. Even the way they balance the number of tiles you have at the end of the game punishes you so that during the game, you aren't as punished for jumping ahead for a good tile.

The overall design of this game is so great with many aspects coming together to create a tight game with lots of interesting decisions.

este jogo é fantástico e quanto mais se joga melhor sabe, no entanto tem um sistema um pouco abrupto de terminar e existem uma ou duas 'tiles' que são completamente 'broken', no entanto é possível fazer algumas alterações e usar regras de casa que tornam o jogo melhor, por ex: o jogo só termina quando não é possível a um jogador recolher uma peça; trocar o lago ness pelo lago oich (basicamente em todos os jogos que joguei a 2, vence quem apanha esta 'tile' mesmo que para isso tenha que dar um salto enorme); e por fim jogar uma versão com as 'tiles'(1,2,3 ou 2 e 3) todas misturadas e separadas em 3 pilhas... sei lá, inventem as vossas, mas joguem-no!

Game core is operated by a big Roundel with players moving their bits and taking a tile. Lots of good decisions, unexpectedly great medium box Alea game #6.

Thank you Secret Santa 2011. Finally a play today 7/21/12. I understand the 13 and up playing age. One needs to have 13 year old eyes in order to read the rulebook. A magnifying glass should have been included with the rules. The game was fun for as much as we played.

Surprisingly complex game built from known mechanisms into something new and uniquely its own.  Non-intuitive at times, after 1 play I think I am starting to get how to play well - each tile has to be worth at least 3 VPs to make it worth playing, but then you can activate it multiple times...

Glen More: Tiny box, giant game. I am constantly struck by just how many decisions and possibilities are available.

RATING: 8
Awesome!  We've played 3 times and I'm already hooked.  :)

UPDATE: My wife isn't thrilled with the theme.  It doesn't "feel" or look like she's building a network of villages in the same way that Carcassonne looks like you're creating the map of the landscape, or in the same sense that in Agricola you can look at your farm when you're done and imagine yourself living there.  I still really like the game, but am inclined to agree with her on this point.  Multi-layer strategy: Check.  Thematic implementation: Not as much as it could have been, perhaps.

UPDATE: We fell out of love with the lack of theme, I think.  It has deeper strategy than Carcassonne, but at least Carcassonne looks like the map of your cities and farms and roads.  For some reason we find that to be more satisfying despite the simplicity of that game.  So we decided to sell Glen More and make room for other games.

Good game with interesting decisions. Too bad the form factor is so bad. They  sacrificed readability and visibility of the icons in favor of pictures.

Lovely interaction of mechanics going on here to create a game that, while short and not having much mechanical complexity, is quite the brain burner in practice.

Unfortunately, the fact that every tile comes out every game (with the exception of some phase 3 tiles that are late on the deck), particularly the tiles with special abilities on cards, can make the game feel less different from one session to the next than, for example, Suburbia or Castle's of Mad King Ludwig.

I enjoyed my first play of Glen More, but it crashed hard with further play. It's hard not to compare Glen More to the similar Vikings, which is a much better game.

The most interesting decisions are where to leave your clansmen, and the way that this limits your selection of tiles in future turns. But slowly building up those margins of chieftains and barrels just feels . . . boring. Games this solitaire-ish need to present players with a more interesting puzzle to solve and/or more ability to plan going forward.

I really, really, really dislike Glen More's cheap look and its muted, clashing color palette. Alea also skimped on the components. There aren't enough resources and VP counters in the box.

Another very good Alea title. At first glance there are a lot of possible strategies. The one minor quibble I have is the 3 player game, where a die is used to randomly remove tiles from the game (simulating a 4th player). 

Unlike another player, where you (sometimes) can predict what will be taken (or even try to 'force' a tile upon them), the die just removes one of the first 3 tiles (50% for the first, 33% for the second and 17% for the third).This mechanism can result in 'illogical' selection and sometimes makes it a bit harder for laonger term planning.

The very limited market is a brutal mechanism, and has got a huge potential to screw other players (or oneself) - I like it.

A beautiful, well-designed and tight game that I simply find frustrating to play. You MUST know the tiles so that you can plan for the future if you want to play well. Certain tiles in the final phase can be deadly, and the timing of their entrance to the game can be game changing. That means (from what I can tell in a handful of plays) that the game is all about keeping pace while you put yourself in the best position to finish strong.

RATING: 7
In a turn order similar to Thebes in the way that you can take many actions in a row by being behind you grab tiles which are placed in front of you activating buildings. Points are awarded in many different ways.

It’s another victory point engine type of game and if that is up your alley you should get it. The game seems to have many avenues to victory and some nice tactical game play. As most Alea games this will probably hold up for many plays, but I just don’t feel that engaged to get it. I am usually not that concerned about graphic design, but don’t like it in this game as the components are too small and doesn’t feel they match together. The art is pretty dark and the game feels pretty theme-less. That makes me sadly less inclined to play it.

Rating after one 5player game. Alea has done another good job. However there are downsides: in our 5player game was a considerable downtime given also to the fact that the game is prone to analysis/paralysis. Another downside is that the tiles are very small. Otherwise the game is very enjoyable and you can put up different strategies which off course must be changeable if you're fellow players don't let you get the tiles you want. Many mechanics you may have seen in other games like Theben, Carcassonne or Siedlers but it feels fresh enough to attract me because of [i]how[/i] getting victory points. Some of my friends said that no matter what you do, you always get some points. This is true, but winning the game means being [i]more[/i] efficient or sneak than your fellow players.

A very interesting design. This is one of the few medium/heavy economic games I've ever played that really engaged me (I usually don't like that sort of thing). The movement mechanic and spatial activation make it very puzzley in an interesting way and the need to raise your score in as many areas as possible while using as few tiles as possible is a very unique kind of challenge. I do really feel, though, like certain tiles are just too rare - in a 5 player game, you can easily have no opportunity to ever buy a distillery, for instance. Also the placement of new tiles on the board gets a little confusing if people start jumping too far ahead. Still, this was very fun and very different and I would definitely enjoy playing more often.

I've only been playing this game 2 player so far and I think its rating would be higher if based on the 3-5 player game, but I can only assume that.  This is namely because the die used to replace the missing player only replaces the player in one way: removing tiles from the track.  if the die could also buy and sell goods, i think players would be less stymied when they want to build certain tiles, but don't have the required resources.  Regardless, the mechanics of this game are quite elegant and I'm quite happy I own it.

Tried it with 4 and found that it really made the game a lot more fun.  It doesn't feel as bad when another player takes a tile as when that stupid die goes around swiping up all the sweetest ones.

RATING: 7.5
Good simple game, even though it is another victory points one. Although shallow, it does have decent replayability since tiles don't come out exactly in the same order, thus making the grabbing different each game.

I prefer many other games, but this one is way better than your average game.

If you like simple games where you build (and gamble a little when playing with the dummy player), this might be your game.

I recommend buying this one if you have tried it and liked it. I would definitively keep it if I had it or someone gave it to me... it's good to play on those evenings you've worked mentally all day, because it is so light and enjoyable.

I think this game is relatively easy to teach, but takes some time to master.  There are lots of choices to make, because there are many tradeoffs -- coins, goods, whisky, cards, etc.  The geographical element adds an additional challenge (because a new tile placement depends on where your clansmen are, and activates the adjacent tiles to the newly-placed one).  

The turn order mechanism is novel and interesting.  Knowing when to jump far ahead on the track and when to go short distances is key.  It's tempting to pick up a lot of tiles when the players are way ahead on the track, but each tile is effectively like spending 3 points, so it's important to be efficient.  Also, when playing with 2 or 3, the extra player's die roll comes into play, which causes some tiles to disappear.  That can throw off your strategy if you're planning on picking up a particular tile which ends up being discarded by the extra player.

Early in the game, cattle (brown cubes) are not useful, but grey and green cubes are very useful for building certain tiles.  Yellow cubes (wheat) are useful for distilling into whisky, which are good for points and are also required to build the point-generating tavern tiles in the #3 stack of tiles.

The markets are surprisingly good tiles.  The one that gives you 12 points for selling 5 different goods cubes is especially good, and can be a game-winner if you can activate it more than once.  It does take a lot of goods, but you might be able to buy those goods from the board for 1 coin each, which is totally worth it.

It's important to pay attention to when the game is about to end, because if you have no more turns left, you want to sell all your goods for coins (each coin is worth a point, and selling your goods prevents others from selling to the bank for those coins) and to move all your clansmen off the board to become chieftains (to compete in the final chieftain scoring).

By reading the comments and reviews, one might conclude then Glen more is a lighter game than it really is; in fact Glen More can be quite brainy, I would recommend to avoid playing this game with the AP-prone; it is certainly more opportunistic than strategic, but the number of choices can be quite a challenge, making Glen More a too involved game to be considered gateway.
I do not find luck to be that an important factor as some reviewers/commenters did.

The choices here are interesting, and the tension between wanting to get lots of scoring tiles and the penalty for expanding too much makes for some great trade offs. There are a couple issues that drag it down, the biggest being downtime. This is one of those games where you will want to get a string of complimentary actions, or even get a string of turns close together, so downtime can be significant. Most of the rules work well enough but some things could have been trimmed to keep the fiddlyness down. For instance the meeple movement feels like an unnecessary constraint and not a very interesting one. Still, this is a reasonable quality game, and I find myself enjoying it more and more.

Wow, with this game, you really think the next game will be the one where you crack the code and find THE strategy. Don't get me wrong, it is fun from the very beginning to expand your scottish community and lay those gorgeous tiles with lakes and villages and fields and destilleries and make everything grow. But next time, man will I make everything just right!

RATING: 7
Nice little game, with more going on than is immediately visible.

Tactical tile playing, and planning for the next tile(s), timing of claims/purchases/sales/turns, action winning, point grabbing or scoring accumulation prior to scoring rounds- a lot to think about, and it keeps changing with the next tiles revealed by other players.

So there's some 'grab it while you can,' but if you miss an opportunity, or fail to plan you could miss out on a critical action you find you need- and it's very easy to do that by mistake.

It went a little long for what it is, but this was also a first play, so I spent more time in the rules than I expect to in the future.

An attractive little game, which could have more thematic art, but what it has is very nice, and is not overdone.

I'm starting this at a 7- I think I will always want to play, but I don't think I'd turn down a game either. A good addition to the Alea Mid-sized box series.

Rating based on around 7 plays. This is a tile-laying game, similar to Carcasonne, but with everybody creating their own little network of villages, resources, and production capability, such that you could call this a "civ-lite" kind of game. Points are scored in three categories: whiskey, special places, and chieftains/tams. VP is a sliding, non-linear scale, based on the delta between your number of items against the player with the least. Players select tiles from a novel rondel-like arrangement, with turn order based on whomever happens to be on the tail end. The selected tile is then positioned relative to the other tiles of the player's tableau based on some placement rules; all surrounding tiles and the tile itself is activated to produce resources or VP.

It is light enough to play quickly, but the varied mechanisms are a bit difficult to grasp at first, and it will take time to explain. There is enough tactical and strategic play to keep the interest of novices and veterans, that it should see more play. There is a lot of gaming goodness in that tiny little box. However, after the initial exposure, I am not too excited to play it again so soon (I still can't articulate why), and hence my initial '7'. It may improve.

Update (03/02/12) 8 plays: I wasn't too excited to play this after being away from it for five months. It is an interesting game, but my initial enthusiasm for the game has faded considerably. Again, I can't articulate why. Holding steady at a '7', but I see this game having a short half-life.

Update (04/21/12) 9 plays: This is like each player playing their own version of Carcasonne: instead of picking off the top of a deck, players have choices from a rectangular arrangement on which tile to pick; players then take that tile and add to their own collection, instead of adding to a collective. The latest play was somewhat exciting, as a new strategy was uncovered.

Update (06/13/2015) 10 plays: Some people had expressed an interest, so we broke it out. It soon became apparent why it was collecting dust on the shelf for the past three years: fiddly components, fiddly rules, and too much downtime, all that has been better implemented as a computer game. General complaints that components needed to be bigger, with text being easier to read. It was like what happened with La Isla, where the publisher took everything and shrank it down to fit into a small box--bad move. It is a good design, with an innovative tile-selection/turn-order mechanism, but it reminded us of the fiddliness of Suburbia and Castles of Mad King Ludwig, where players took too much time to decide where to place a tile on their expanding village tableau. That was the initial major gripe of CoMKL--too much downtime. I think we've been recently spoiled with sleeker, smoother games like Deus and Ginkgopolis that play quickly in about an hour. With five players, and having to rehash the rules, this exercise took over two hours, where the expectation was it was supposed to be a quick, simple game of an hour. Just like the other games, this requires frequent play to familiarize oneself in order to play quickly. It's not bad, but it's not great, so it doesn't come out as often. Infrequent play means forgotten rules and an generally unsatisfying, "meh", gaming experience. Dropping to a "6".

My estimation of this game has gone up from my initial play. I think it is one of the better "short but not filler" games I've played. That is, games that are less than ~60 minutes but have more strategy/planning/tactics than you expect from most "fillers".

I think the spatial aspect of the tile laying is what pushes it over the top for me. It combines everything into a very "efficiency engine" that, for some reason, isn't as dry as, say, St. Petersburg.

I have some concern that some of the special buildings are too overwhelming in scoring (and too subtle for newbies to understand their worth) but I dunno if I'll ever play this enough for that to be a real problem.

You build a personal tableau of tiles that generate resources or converts them into points. There is a spacial aspect in that you can only build around where you have a guy standing. Tiles with a river always flows vertial, the road horizontal, and some tiles have no special attributes so they can be placed more freely.

A few neat things about the game:
Scoring is literally relative to what everyone else is doing, so it's got that same-strategy-won't-work every time thing going for it. Player order is determined by the person standing furthest in the back, so skipping far ahead to snag the tile you want may cost you some turns (which might or might not be a bad thing). And money never enters* or leaves the game--if you need to buy a resource, the money goes on top of a spot on the center board signifying that now that one unit of that resource can be sold for that money, or the next person who buys that type of resource from the bank has to pay a higher price.

I really like this game, and it plays great with two, despite the trepidation I had over the dummy player. It's really quick once everyone knows it (only half an hour with two!) but always feels like you've played a fairly meaty game.

There are a few little fiddly hidden rules, mostly relating to the special location tiles, but in general everything works together really well.

Oh, this is a good one. In many games of this type, it's difficult to get a good engine going, but things smooth out once you're established. Not Glen More. It's a constant struggle to keep things going and there's always planning and an element of risk.  Everything depends on performance relative to the other players in the game, so there's an element of keeping an eye on them as well.  I really enjoy trying to make this work, even though I'm not very good at it. (5+ plays)

If you like games like stone age and/or powergrid, you'll most likely enjoy this game. Solid game that we always come back to. Plays like a combination of Seeland and Alhambra. 


You have a track that you move around to purchase tiles(how far you go affects how many turns you can get in a game). Once you purchase a tile, you place it attached to your village, with certain placement restrictions. Where you place it, determines what resources you can gain.

Solid mechanics and balance in this game. It's a go-to staple amongst our horde of boxes.

Neutral - on occasion

Few unique mechanics combined with the unexceptional "cube to VP". A straightforward cube-to-VP game usually feels "meh" now (at 2015), but this one does not (for me). I'm surprised that it still has enough tricks to make some fresh air.

Tempo flows fluently. The game shines more when players try a little bit harder to create as big combo as possible. If player just play it in a casual way, it's still fine(since the tempo runs very smoothly, much like the case of Carcassonne)

Finally got this game from Germany and we got a chance to play it.  I liked the game.

RATING: 7
A little Carcasonne-ish, offers a much richer game with multiple strategies for end game point gathering.  Employs a clever resource track that allows you to leap ahead to grab terrain you really want (but punishes you by having to wait until everyone else has caught up on the track), but also will punish slow movers who hoover up all the territory left behind (nicely balanced).  Plays reasonably quickly but can have significant down time.

Jan11:

A few plays in, and I really am liking this one.

In particular, I love how everything thing in the game comes with trade-offs.  Heck, each tile you take is a strict -3 VP so you need to be sure to earn at least 3 VP by taking them.

The market makes for some neat swing of supply and demand.

At the moment in two player, it almost appears like you should gobble gobble gobble.  I've won just by having the most tiles.

I love the theme.  I actually replaced the sheep&cow cubes with sheeples and cowpules.  It adds a lot to the game so that the only cubes are the resources.

Anyway, I need to try some more with more than 2 players.

Pleasantly surprised with this one, really liked the "loop" mechanic.  Played with 3 players there was a nice balance between taking the best tile available, and potentially leaving a large number of decent tiles for your opponents to gobble up.  There was a perfect amount of "resources" to balance during the game, and there are multiple routes to victory.  What's more, it seems that the games would always be quite tight after final scoring.

A nice game with a decent theme and clever mechanics, all you could ask from a quality Euro.

[b]2 Player Review: [/b]

This is the game that made it painfully obvious my talent lies in long-term planning, while Yuki's is all about the short-term goals and how to make every turn count. Because of the constantly changing nature of what tiles are available each turn, I am unable to commit to a strategy. With that in mind though I always look forward to our next match so I can learn from the master and hopefully win consistently for a few matches some day. 

The presentation of the titles is fantastic and the constriction of placement based on the road or river is clever and only makes the tiles with no such restriction more sorely sort after. The market allows for the purchasing of resources which gives a little more leeway to the game play in case you don't have the exact resources available. 

[b]Pros:[/b]

- You feel like your building your own corner of Scotland. 
- Plays quickly with lots of choices to agonize over turn. 
- It's great fun to collect whiskey barrels!

[b]Cons:[/b]

-Once you fall behind it's difficult to catch-up.
-The randomness of the dummy player leads to a lot of frustration in a 2 player game.

Decent game.  Building restrictions seem a bit forced and unpredictable. Probably won't have a spot in my collection, as I have others of the same weight

update: this one crept up by over half a point, after I got it at a discount.  It is actually in my travel bag now, as the only heavier game that is always with me.  People seem to pick this up quickly, and enjoy it.  I like the delayed gratification type decision that are made on each turn.  Played with the die in the 3 player game and that seemed to work just fine too.

RATING: 9
Everything about this game is a balancing act!  How far do you move ahead to get your next tile?  How many tiles should you build?  How many chieftans should you promote?

This has lots of little clever aspects to it that appeal to me: moving around the board picking up tiles, the turn-order mechanism, the tile-laying rules, the special tiles, etc. I find it to be on the lighter end of medium-weight games, although I've experienced first-hand that it might be complicated for some people. It probably helps to play it once or twice in order to have an idea of what kinds of tiles will be available throughout the game and how you will use the various production mechanisms to score points. 

Also, the game reminded me heavily of Suburbia (of course, I know that Suburbia is newer), but I [i]much[/i] prefer this one.

A cute little euro, this game's strongest feature is the way you move around the track (ala Thebes or Egizia).  However, there are too few ways to score points, so most of the resource gathering you do ends up being irrelevant.

While I enjoyed my play, it many ways the game typifies the critique against Euros.  Its processional, thinly themed and an exercise in group solitaire.  Not much you haven't seen in other games other than kind of a spatial element to tile placement.  Alea's graphical work used to be at least very functional.  This game carries neither the rich visual potential of a game with a Scottish theme, nor the functionality that we have come to expect from premier German publishers.

RATING: 7
Most fun I've ever had playing multiplayer solitaire (and that's not a moniker that I throw around liberally). Glen More presents an elegant, interesting, and well-balanced system to tinker with. The turn track evokes fond memories of Neuland (which should make that great game easier to teach!), and the closed market is an impressively simple implementation that I've never seen before.

Biggest issues are subpar component quality (which makes the game tough to learn) and how it skews from "tactical" to "wildly tactical" once you go from 3 players to 4 or 5. Also a lot of downtime in the 5 player game, though I did not see that when playing with 4.

Rating after 1 play.  "Alhambra squared."  This is a beautiful tile-laying game (like Alhambra) but with far more strategic play.  The player track is a brilliant way to offer more choice in tiles.  Do you jump ahead for a particularly good one, effectively giving up some turns?  You're rarely shut out of a tile by sheer luck, if you want it badly enough.  And the market is a brilliant way to balance resources.  It's tough to get a balanced economic engine, since early placements get harder to activate over time, but the market gives you options as long as, again, you're willing to pay the price.  This feels like trading in other games, but with pricing  discipline.  That is, one player can't be generous out of good nature.  If you're underproducing wheat and need it for your distillery, you will have to pay higher prices as you buy more (unless of course there are two players overproducing wheat, in which case they may both be selling and keeping the price down.  I love this.).  After one play I don't have a firm grasp on strategy, but there certainly appear to be multiple paths to victory.  The players in my first game took very different paths (one with a virtual whiskey monopoly and a big lead in chieftans), but the scores were close.  Looking forward to more plays.  Packs a lot of strategic punch and thematic appeal (the mechanisms may not be thematic, but the tiles are evocative) in a small box.

Played once with five.  A couple rules were interpreted incorrectly, which may have changed the outcome, but I didn't really care.

Glen More isn't reminiscent of too many games I've played, and yet, it is reminiscent of many games I have played.  It is more or less a puzzle game with resource and time management.  There are so many ways to score that it seems like pretty much everything is a viable strategy.  Whatever you do, you're going to be able to score points from it, deny points from other players, or make resources that can be used to score points.  Because having less tiles than opponents, tile/points efficiency matters too.

There's not much tension, and your decision tree is small.  The icons are horrid and miniscule.  Some of them are seriously only 2mm.  If they were four times the size, you would be able to read the tiles from a distance, but it was very hard to see what tiles did at all.

Five is too many people for this game.  The downtime is bad.  I'd be willing to give the game another shot, but probably with only 3 players max, and I wouldn't have high expectations.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (February 2017)

I finally played Glen more face to face. I have previously played a couple of times online and, although I understood the core mechanism of the game, I had some holes in the rules. I always lost my games and I didn’t know why. A friend explained the game to me and it turned out the biggest you village the more points you will lose at the end :D. 

I bought the game on 2015 and I finally played it. In general I dislike tile laying games, but I enjoyed Glen More.

The rules are pretty easy to teach, you can do it under 10 minutes. The hardest are the special tiles but you can explain them as they appear. The game moves at a fast pace, playtime is around 60 minutes.

The game´s components are very flimsy, furthermore, it was a very expensive game, I had to import from Germany as it was out of print in America. The art is ok, but the tiles have tiny text on them that isn’t easy to read.

Best with 4 fast players, with more I begin to feel the downtime.

Ok theme, but it doesn’t excite me (that’s ok for an Euro game). In any case it is very thin.

The game´s decisions are very interesting (namely, which tile to take, where to put it, how to move your meeples inside your village and how far to jump ahead in the turn order track). Going last all the time seems great, but, as I wrote before, if you take a lot more tiles that your opponents, at the end of the game you will lose a lot of points, so you have to strike a balance between opportunistic turn order and village size, I love this (and that’s missing from Kraftwagen, a game that uses the same mechanism but do not penalize taking a lot of extra actions). Glen More is more deep that I initially thought.

I also enjoy the spatial element of building your village. It seems the game has many paths to victory, but I need more plays to verify this point.

Bottom line, Glen More is a good Euro game and a solid 7.0 to me. It plays very fast for a game of this kind and I want to explore it further. It is a keeper in my game collection. I know a second edition of the game is coming, but I’m not sure if I will get it, time will tell.

One of 2010 favorites.

There's a lot going on in this game. Tons of decisions to be made. After 2 plays with 2 players I can see that the game is going to get better the more times we play it and understand what's going on. 

My wife beat me so bad the first game, 67-17. The second game was a lot closer. I won 52-42.The robot die really made my wife mad!

The surprise hit of fall 2010 for me, this light game wasn’t on my radar at all until a somewhat serendipitous play at BGG.CON.  The time track is the standout feature, and shares with the other games using this mechanic that it is nothing like the others.  There is a heavily spatial element which is somewhat reminiscent of Vikings.  The scoring is an interesting back-and-forth between resource conversion activities and long-term majority scoring.  I don’t think a player can get by totally avoiding the resource conversions but certainly the all-out pointmongering seems balanced with a more hybrid long-term approach, which is good.

At the Alea small box price point, this is a likely purchase.  A fair bit of game in a small package.

As it stands I like this game because of its fantastic strategic depth.  But it feels VERY gamey and with the wrong players AP is out in spades.  Not sure who's playing it that they say anyone can play this game fast, but I'd like to play it with them.  Then Glen More would go from "like" to "love."

This game has gone from like to love.  It's now a favorite and I would never get rid of it.  Such a fantastic design.  Wish I got to play it more often.

One solo game, one 4 player and one 5 player game  player game only.

Tile and resource games are not usually my thing, but the Scottish theme ('cause I'm Scottish) and some favourable comments here on BGG drew me to this one, and I'm glad they did.

I like the way the various elements of the game come together in a 'sum of the parts' way. I agree with those who think that there's a puzzle-like element to choosing and placing tiles: from a simple base it makes you think, and it's quick to play.

Various ways of scoring points, so if someone else is cornering the distillery points go for chieftans or castles etc.

RATING: 9
For the price strikes me as a solid game.  Kinda surprised this one isn't talked about more.  My only real complaint is that the board and the tiles could have been a little bigger.  Gaming content thus far has proven strong with replayability unlimited.  No obvious path to victory that I can see...not yet at least.

Bumping this one up.  I find myself requesting to play this game fairly often.

**Edit**
This is a remarkable game.  I've found that I'm actually quite terrible at it but am willing to play pretty much any time.  Given it's price point I would strongly recommend adding it to your collection.  I can't understand why this one isn't in the top 100 on BGG...probably one of the most underrated games on this site.

I like this rondel style tile laying game. The rondel is a very interesting mechanism, forcing you to make tough decisions between the tiles you want, knowing that your opponents will pick up what you don't. On top of that, the different tile effects and the ways in which they interact to produce points are simple enough to not be fiddly, but deep enough to make that part of the game fun.

I had read up on this on the Geek and was excited to try. Unfortunately I like it a lot less than I thought I would going in.

Liked: the theme and art; the closed economy; the time movement track a la Red November; the "difference scoring".

Disliked: new player extreme handicap. new players don't know the best "power combos" and tile distribution; this can also really screw up the game (by screw up the game I mean 80% of visible tiles being unavailable to anyone at all) by skipping critical resources early in the game not knowing more won't be available; constraint of using as few tiles as possible was frustrating when attempting to attend the various VP generating avenues. I disagree with a lot of "multiplayer solitaire" criticisms of euros but in this game I feel it's apt. Component font was way too small. In the end a small dose of fun with a larger dose of frustrating.

RATING: 9
One of the best games of 2010, somehow lost in the crowd after a low profile release early in the year. 

Each player undertakes the role of a clan in medieval Scotland, pushing outward into an expanse of land that includes villages, castles, lakes (even Loch Ness), pastures, woods, fairgrounds, distilleries, and so on. This expanse is built out of tiles in a Carcassonne-like fashion, with some great twists. First, tiles are drafted from the board using the Thebes-system for time-lapse: a player who takes a tile farther in the queue will have to wait a while before getting another turn. I've always enjoyed this tradeoff in games like Thebes and Tinners' Trail, and I found it well-implemented here. Is it worth jumping way ahead for a good tile, and giving other players an extra turn or two? How badly do I want it? Second, the game includes an extremely well-tuned resource market that provides tough tradeoffs and gratifying flexibility. Essentially, the market allows players to take tiles they are otherwise not prepared for (for example, building a castle even if they have not hauled stone from a quarry), but the game's economy is closed, so any money used to purchase goods will ultimately end up in the hands of another player. Very slick. Third, players must carefully move clan-members around on their board to enable effective expansion, and each tile added to the board activates all of the tiles surrounding it. Fourth, the game also rewards players for specializing (always a good thing in my book), and also penalizes the players who took the most tiles at the end of the game, essentially rewarding the players who made the most of a slim tile-set. Add in some special-buildings with unique perks, and you've got a fabulous game.

Players move around a board and select tiles many of which create resources. They need to be played orthogonal or diagonal to your meeples and connected correctly to the other tiles. To buy certain tiles requires resources. There are various ways to gain victory points such as coverting resources with certain tiles, buying special cards, selling resources on the market, removing a meeple, and making barrels of ale. Also try not to get too many more tiles than the person with the least since you will lose points.

Glen More uses the whole range of eurogame mechanisms by combining resource management, engine building and spatial tile placement in a not too complicated but slightly fiddly game with a multidimensional scoring mechanism. First play didn't wow me but left me thinking about the game afterwards. Three very different strategies led to a very close result. Further plays have to show whether the closeness is a sign of strategic variability or an illusion of the same while decisions only matter as long as you don't make severe blunders.

RATING: 8
Initial rating 7, but I think I'm going up to 8 on this one. Glen More feels like a nice blend of Alhambra's tile laying) and Thebes' turn-taking mechanism. While a genuine Euro, the Scottish theme does come through to some extent via the clansmen, chieftains, and the location-specific tiles. While I suspect that 4 and 5 players are probably better, the "dummy" player for 2- and 3-player games is simple enough to execute and probably not a lot more random than some players I know. I think this game probably "fires" Alhambra for me; I'm hard pressed to think of something in Alhambra that I like better than its Glen More counterpart.

Players pick tiles of a circular board and make their own carcassonne city. Interesting use of builders and tile activation. I liked the tile-purchasing mechanic a lot, but the city-building seemed a bit dull. Not as much variety to activate tiles as (for example) Suburbia.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The tiles could be bigger. I am kind of sad and disappointed every time I look at the small tiles. I love the artwork, but the size... 
Other than that, I  like the game a lot 
I like how the market system works, it is tight and how you can buy only as many resources as you need so you cannot pile them .
Some neat mechanism, such as the rules for tile laying, the turn order (which I first found strange) and the use of the pawns. I love the castle tiles with various benefits.
You can chose different directions to pursue. 
Yes, it is true that the dice is important in a two player game but I do not see it necessary in a three player game. 
Even if the tiles are small, I like how you can either buy or gain resources and decide whether you want to get resources (and what kind), which tiles you want to pick and how you combine gaining VPs, resources and/or cards during the game. 
Finally, I like how the game combines resource management and tile laying elements.

A brilliant idea for manipulating turn order carries this game alone quite far. Add smart building rules using the workers and and an interesting economy and you have a relatively good game.

The turn order system of Glen More is great. Many times you will find yourself struggling with the decision whether to jump ahead and take what you really want or take something less important, so that your opponents don't get multiple turns before you can take your next one.

The system of tile placement and activation also quite neat.

And finally: It's got one of the most elegant dummy players I've seen.

Tile-laying, worker-placement game with an interesting mechanism where the last player goes until they move forward, so there is a chance for that player to go multiple times before others go.

There's a lot going on in this quick playing game.  Which tile you pick can affect turn order.  Whether or not to remove your meeples for VP.  Where to place tiles to activate your other tiles.  When to sell and buy resources.  

My first game went so fast, I didn't have time to consider all of the possiblities.  This is short enough to be a filler, but deep enough to get  alot of replays.

I don't know but I like this game.  I like the turn order mechanism whereby whoever is at the end of the track is the one whose turn it is.  However I'm not sure if the rating wouldn't dip a bit after repeated plays.  I need to play this more to find out where it sits with me whether as a very good game that I'd suggest or as good game that I'd play occasionally.  The artwork is okay but could be better.  Also going go it is that it's a compact and quick playing game.

I've been really impressed with this game. It has been regularly requested by my wife which is no mean feat. 

I find it to have a similar sense of satisfaction to Agricola, insofar as it is rewarding to sit back at the end of a game and observe your operational Scottish village.

One complaint: I really wish they would have spend a few more $ on the quality of the components. This FEELS like playing a cheap game, which ultimately belies the quality of the mechanics that create such a wonderful little gem.

Quite typical Euro. Limited interaction among players. Building one's own economic engine and generating victory points through it.

Everything works, everything is well-developed, it's a nice game and I also like that it's not too long. It's just not that interesting; also it has some production issues (too small, thin and shiny tiles). All in all, a nice game, just nothing to be really excited about.

Played three times, 5p, 3p.  Better than I expected, with one of my favorite new mechanics; something very similar to the "time" mechanic from Tinners' Trail and Thebes (a player continues to take actions until they "catch up" with the other players). Has some very manageable random aspects; these aspects become more important, though, with more players.  The activation rules are slightly fiddly, but a couple of games will make them clear.  The game was more fun with 3 than 5.

Very nice game with decent length and cute theme.  Mechanics are pretty original/unique which is both interesting and a hurdle for some players.  Lighter / flukier than many euros with a still decent amount of player agency and fluid play.  Scoring is somewhat arcane which combines with the mechanics to make this mostly a gamer game.

I really enjoy this game. A kind of worker placement / ressource mangement game, but the mechanics are different from the other games I own (and have played). Lighter end of the scale, but it's really good. Meeples from Scotland that can make whiskey :)

Excellent tile laying game with some solid and interesting twists.  If behind on the turn track, you keep going unitl you pass someone else.  Build up a tableu with synergy and you should score a fair bit of points.  Plays in an hour or so.  Bit of a puzzle aspect as you must consider tile placement according to rivers, roads, and open sides as well as where your pawns are located.  Looking forward to playing this one more!

We had heard some good things about [thing=66362][/thing], so we were interested, particularly since it sounded like a light economic game combined with the tile laying of [thing=822][/thing].  We were able to get a copy and give it a try.

The game went over pretty well.  The turn and tile selection track is a neat idea.  The tile laying and activation mechanism is interesting---since you can only activate and use a tile that's adjacent to the one you placed, you can only use a particular tile a limited amount of time.  As a result, you do get a feeling of using up and exhausting your resources and being forced to expand into newer areas.  There do seem to be several ways to score points, as well as special buildings that can help a particular strategy.  The scoring does feel a little fiddly (it's all relative positioning  between players), but you get used to it after several plays.  

The two player game does have sort of a dummy player, but it's really just a die that randomly removes some of the tiles.  Like "Dirk" in [thing=6249][/thing], it doesn't take too much time to implement, and it gives the game a little bit of variety.  It's nothing to be worried about.  We also haven't really utilized the market too much.  On the other hand, it is a relatively light game with a lot of familiar ideas, but it does scratch that itch in a short amount of time.

Yup. Its good. its fun and very clever. Scales fantastically from 2 players up and a game I play often with the wife. My only gripe with the game preventing it from scoring higher is the components. I'm not happy with them. Cave Troll costs less and has great components. Why doesn't Glen More? Its a missed opportunity - I hope they catch a clue and replace the ugly cubes with assorted meepels. That being said thats my next buy a bag of meeples to replace the cubes :)

This game really rewards intelligent play and once I do something intelligent in the game I will update the comment below.

Glen More has aspects familiar to those who have played Carcasonne & Tutankhamun.  But through incredible design reveals how puny these games are.  Glen More is a musclebound game with real strength, real ambition and replayability.  A powerhouse in a relatively small box.

The combination of tiles, workers & resources create a variety of routes to victory, which though may be difficult to grasp at first, rewards continued play.  I lost by a distance, my best turn being the last getting several resources to high scoring markets, but Glen More is certainly a game I would like to revisit.

I really want to like this game. It's about making whiskeys set in Scotland! However when I first played it, I figured the turn thing wrong and end up playing too slowly in the first few rounds which kind of spoilt the whole game for me. However I want to give this game another chance and hopefully could get to play it for 2 players when it's more faster.

RATING: 7
The rondel mechanic causes you to have to adapt your strategy a bit each game based on which tiles show up when despite always using the same tiles, and I also like the tricky task of placing your tiles optimally. I wouldn't say it's the most replayable game ever, but which special tiles and resource to VP conversion tiles you can get a hand on can really change the valuation of your tiles. Also, that you can have fewer (and potentially want fewer turns to prevent the negative VPs at the end of hte game) turns depending on how far you move on the rondel is mechanic not utilized much. However, the theme is completely pasted on, and component quality is pretty bad.

One of my friends compared this game to Suburbia, as both rely heavily on tile placement, both require you to get certain tile combos to build an optimal engine, and both have a mechanism to make you pay for taking tiles that more recently appeared (money vs. # of turns). I've never thought of it that way before, but now I guess they also both share the bad similarity of using most/all of their tiles each game instead of having more variability, and yet how early each tile shows up can really affect the game.

It combines engine-building, tile-laying, and drafting in a very tight package. I love the depth of this game relative to its play length (30 minutes?).

The variety of possible strategies is great. I've seen people win with all kinds of extremes, as well as balanced approaches.

This kind of track for picking actions is always very interesting. Other games have used similar approaches, but what makes Glen More stand out is that you're penalized for having lots of tiles on your board, so you're incentivized to jump ahead to the juicy tiles instead of just picking one of the 2-3 tiles in front of you.

RATING: 7
Feels a tiny bit like multiplayer solitaire as you don't REALLY need to pay much attention to what other players are doing.  However, I thought it played very smoothly and was enjoyable and I actually did much better than I originally thought I was doing due to the end game scoring with penalties given out to the other players for having boards that were too big.

Nice game that plays quickly and has some fun mechanics.

This game has a lot of things I like and it's a good game. It's just not for me. Troyes had the same effect. I would be glad to play either one again. Has the same thing as London - the new player extreme handicap. new players don't know the best "power combos" and tile distribution.The game also encourages you to jump ahead and then you wait for your next turn as you go back and fourth to the rule book to see what the next new tile out does. We played a three player game and it went pretty fast but with some people in a four or five player game it could get quite long. This game will also require you to reread the rules every time you play it or something will be forgotten.

this game is a little hard to wrap your mind around.  why do i need these black meeples?  how do i trigger what?  why would i want this tile instead of that tile?

i like cube collecting, farming, and economic engines though, so i enjoyed this.

I'm a fan. Very neat little set of mechanics - the turn order track, the activation of surrounding tiles (a little puzzle to see where to put your clansmen for best effect), the varied ways of generating VP and the market (a closed economy) are all combined into a reasonably short and engaging game with a variety of ways to win. Not sure if everyone around me entirely agrees (a game that seems to have a 'like but don't love' vibe about it), but I will play it any time.

An interesting Euro where you are laying tiles and activating nearby tiles.  Selecting tiles is done where you move forward on track to draft the tiles but you can go again if you are behind all other players.  There are multiple paths to victory including having a small number of tiles or large tile numbers.  You have different types of goods you can produce including whiskey. Players lose points at the end if there fields are the largest compared to the player with smallest field.  

An excellent game with somewhat unique mechanics when it came out.

Although it has some similarities to [i]At the Gates of Loyang[/i] in that you can do your actions in any order you wish (and there's lots of cube pushing in the process), I don't enjoy [i]Glen More[/i] as much. But then, I think the real decisions are not how you puzzle through your order of activating the tiles, but in the choice of the tile (à la [i]Thebes[/i]) and the choice of where you place it, as these determine what you can activate.  I found the "dummy" player (in the two-player game) a bit of a distraction at first, but have become used to it over time.  All in all, [i]Glen More[/i] is a very good (two-player) game, but not a great one.

Neat game with some good ideas ... that is if I could see it. 

I thought Spielbox was harsh in its review for putting such an emphasis on the physical design, but in this case it is justified. The publisher has f**ked up the physical design by about 150%, meaning that all materials must be scaled up 150% before the game becomes playable for real.

The game seems really good and original, and apart from the physical design, I only have objections to the massive downtimes you can run into. 
In one game I experienced waiting through 11 turns before it was my turn again, and then the game was almost over - it was my own fault of course, but that makes it no less frustrating.

One of my first game purchases when I started getting into the hobby in 2012. I'd enjoyed playing the Yucata version so much that a physical copy was inevitable. It scratches the same itch as Castles of Burgundy in a way but with more grit / player interaction. I also like how generous the game feels. It flatters you, by which I mean you always come away from a turn feeling like you achieved quite a bit. Not a stingy Agricola type of game at all. Very satisfying!

A quete little game that holds more of tactics and strategy that first meets the eye. I like the theme and the way the villages builds. The replayabillity is high and several ways to victory with rather low random impact but easy to go wrong if not planning a bit ahead.I think you could get more out of the market and the economics than now, but it is a good thing it is closed so there is no snowballing. With 5 players it might tend to drag abit if not all in the group is pretty quick.

Even tho I seldom feel a thrill when it hit the table there is always a feeling of an well spent hour with both exitement and joy when done, and I can warmly recomend it for a try.

Glen More feels a bit like it was released a decade earlier than it actually was. It's an archetypal Euro; dry/loose theme, small amount of luck, indirect conflict, multiple paths to victory, and lots of bits of wood. These are things that I like, providing that the gameplay is interesting (which it is).

Unfortunately, even though I really enjoy playing Glen More, I don't play it very often. This is probably because it is such an innocuous game (in its small, bland box) that it doesn't leap out at me when I'm considering what to play. I guess I'll have to try and remind myself of this game a bit more often.

The average resource management game (gather them, convert them into VPs) with a couple of twists (realtive scoring, turn order).

Its worse flaw is downtime (there's no interactions with the opponents and turn order is not fixed): you'll spend way more time waiting than playing.
Maybe it is better with fewer players to mitigate this issue.

a unique take on worker placement and resource management.
Turn order depends on what you chose from from the tiles to pick from, and that works quite smoothly.  You can get into some binds but mostly just with tile placement as you have to have a worker present.  

I played with three and I think would work well at all player counts your just possibly not going to get as many tiles and the market on resources could be more important.

Compactness is something I value a lot in game design, and Glen More was apparently designed by somebody just as enticed by efficiency. Small meeples race around a small track to snap up small tiles that are subsequently placed in your small building area so that you gain the biggest amount of small resources and no less small victory point counters. What's not to love?

Apart from that (possibly rather special) appeal , Glen More offers a lot of planning, smart use of the Jenseits von Theben time track, and all of it in a rather small (here I go again) amount of time.

This is such a good game, with innovative turn order and tile selection mechanism which is later incorporated into games like kraftwagen, heaven and ale just to name a few. Game has sufficient interaction among players, but what really makes the game shine is the combo potentials for each action that can be highly rewarding. As a result, what tiles to grab and what to skip have great significance. Tight gameplay however makes the game very AP prone, which is the biggest downside. Also the component quality is not the greatest based on today's standards.

Smart game of kind of worker placement creating an expanding homeland. To score higher you have to keep it small and at the same time have more than your opponents in several categories: castles, lakes, whisky, clan chieftains, money. This makes every move count, which is good. It gets repetitive after much playing but it's refreshing to play from time to time. It's quite fast to play.

I wanted to love Glen More, but my one play didn't grab me. The theme is a winner, and I like the combination of mechanisms -- but, for whatever reason, not the whole.

The turn mechanic is fun, but didn't blow my skirt up quite as much as I expected. The board doesn't need to be larger, but I always felt crowded using it; apart from that, the components are nice.

I probably should have tried it again, but life is short and full of other games so I sold it instead.

RATING: 7
A light euro that plays very quickly for 2-4 players.  Haven't tried it with five.  Nothing earth shattering or ground breaking, but interesting.  Appeals to me because there are quite a few decisions to make in a quick game.  Will get plenty of plays.

Note: I think the insert is worthless and the rulebook is on the poor side of things.

As far as tile-laying games are concerned, this might be my favorite one. To be sure, I prefer both Hawaii and Vikings to this game, but unlike Glen More, those games offer several mechanisms blended into crazy good games. This one is more of a pure tile-layer. It's certainly more fun than Carcassonne, which although I enjoy, I find sort of bland. I think the turn order mechanic in this game is what makes it pop. The special buildings don't hurt either. Solid game!


Update 7/10/15: Even better the second game. A keeper!

I like the mechanics, the track that allows you to skip ahead to claim a juicy tile but at the cost of giving up more tiles to your opponent. That's nice in theory, but i never found that we ever really skipped ahead that much at all, which turned the game into more of a random back and forth tile draw..less exhilarating. I like the tile placement and the moving around of the clansmen, so i have a good appreciation of the design and mechanics. Yet this one still fell a little flat for me.

Enjoy the tile laying mechanic combined with the economic elements and variable playing order.  A well balanced game which discourages over specialising due to the differential scoring mechanism (# whiskey barrels; # tarls; # special location tiles).  Many possible paths to victory.

Like the theme too.  The components could be better - some of the iconography is takes getting used to.  But it is a great game, and one that appeals to my heritage.

Experience after one play: the game has to grow on me. I like the theme very much, but my wife has to get used to it. I like the fact that putting together your glen is also very important. Funny to see how the different glens grow!

I like the economy of the game (with the market), very simple to understand, better than the trade in 7 Wonders (yes, this game is in my opinion comparable to 7 Wonders). I also like the fact that everybody chooses from the same visible 'hand'. Also the dummy-player adds some randomness which is good.

Still have to get used to the game (the theme and game feel is not as slick and 'happy' as 7 Wonders), but I like to play it.

Edit: introduced the game to my parents. It was very hard to get them to learn all the ins and outs of the game, but at the end scoring they actually really liked the game. My wife is still a bit 'meh' about this game, she played because of me. It isn't 7 Wonders, I actually think it is Tokaido, but then upgraded... Maybe Tokaido and Among the Stars/7 Wonders together? This time I actually saw the interaction between players of the intermediate scoring and that you really have to watch your opponents. I also like the puzzle-element in the game (how to place your tiles).

[b]2015-08-25 7[/b] After 1 Play:
Random and almost impossible to plan at 5-player. The tile placement itself is quite clever but scoring mechanism is a bit weaker. Hoping lower player count plays better but not sure if it's worth the time to try again. Should this be a 6?

RATING: 9
One of my favorite worker placement games. I like the mechanic of choosing tiles based on where you will end up in the player order. Take a few less optimal tiles and get more, or go farther ahead for that amazing one. The tile placement and activations are also unique, as is the scoring. Altogether a a wonderful little euro package.

Think carcassonne, alhambra, and resource management.  A good execution of a game building up from the lighter games.  Good components, great artwork and fun mechanism.

Odd note: the bonus score tiles have two sides that say the same thing just worded slightly differently (why?).

This is a quintessential eurogame in many ways.
Resource management (cube pushing)?  Check.
Tile Laying?  Check.
Variable Player Order? Check.
Economic Engine? Check.
Multiple Scoring Paths? Check.
That said, I do like the game quite a bit.  There is a fair amount of strategy at work and you need make some careful decisions to get the most points while always keeping an eye on what your opponent is doing. I like the scoring mechanism and the tile section, encourages more player interaction.  My gripes is that the game feels like it ends a little too early, and I'm often left wanting 1 or 2 more turns, but it gets the game time down.  The components are nice, but I wish everything was about 50% bigger ... then again its pretty portable as far as euros go.

Played a five-player game. I liked Glen More but found it somewhat frustrating. The mechanisms are not what I'd call intuative. So I spent the first half of this outing "fighting the game system", and the second half lamenting there were no good tiles for me to grab from the display.  As to the game components/graphics, I thought the tiles were too small, and the text on them was microscopic.  The iconography was OK except for the the symbol for VPs. Without being told I never would have figured out a green hex = VPs, when there was a green resource (lumber) in the game. The coins were very thin. There is no direct player interaction, and only a little indirectly. Even though it only lasted 1.7 hours the down time between turns really got to me.

This is kind of a strange mash of things.

Ok cubepushing/tilelaying game. Mishmash of mechanisms seen before (f.e.: player turn a la Thebes/Tinner's Trails/Red novemeber) in a new mix. but it doesn't feel 'fresh' to me.

Although the various tiles seem to be thematically related, it's still quite 'gamey' and dry. Especially the interaction level is way too low for me. Bit too much multiplayer solitaire.

Although it's not bad I have no need to buy this one. Especially not so good with AP prone people (downtime). 

Several times during the game we got distracted by chatting nicely while someone was taking his turn.

Started out okay, when the game was over I felt I had already played it enough. Wouldn't mind sitting in if someone would really want to play this, but wouldn't suggest it. After a session with 4 players I'd rather NOT play this with more than 3. 
Although with 3 you seem to get another randomization with a dummy player, which I suspect is pretty sucky. And would definitely not play it with 5.

Really enjoyable tile-laying game where you constantly have the pull between taking the readily available options or making a longer jump to secure yourself that tile you desperately want, while at the same time leaving your opponent(s) with less competition for the tiles you skipped.

The mechanics are really tight, like the market capping both how much of a resource can be bought or sold, and how that becomes like a double-edged sword, as one player might gain a lot of money from selling a resource, but at the same time if they do they are opening up for opponents to buy the resource to afford certain tiles - and vice versa, a player might buy the last resource, but know they are opening up for an opponent to sell theirs for a higher price.

And although it's no secret when round scorings are triggered, so far I've experienced that the player who doesn't directly trigger it forgets to plan for it, and the triggering player can use that to their advantage to earn a couple of extra points with a well-timed tile-choice.

Finally I like that the end game scoring includes a penalty for players who decided to build big, making the game more balanced as building efficiently ultimately becomes more important than building big.

One of the best games from 2010.

A tense and meaningful gameplay packed into a short playtime is for sure a winner in my book.

It could be descriped as a standard euro, but with the mix of allready known mechanics it manages to feel fresh, innovative and engaging. A label I unfortunately cant give a lot of euros nowadays.

There are many different strategies and ways to score VP, but after several plays everything seems very well ballanced.
What seems to matter the most is, who most effectively carries out their chosen strategy. 
Managing your tableau is key, as clever placement of tiles can provide very powerfull combos when activated.

In short, this is a great game that grows on you with each play.

[u]23-Jan-2013[/u]: I have several plays of this one, but many of them were me trying to come up with [article=15917977]my own set of rules[/article] based on [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/643104/anyone-worked-up-a-solo-variant/new]this Solo variant thread.[/url]

Anyway, I really like this game and hope to get it to the table with opponents some day.  It's got elements of Carcassonne and 7 Wonders in it...two games that I enjoy a lot.  You draft tiles from the central board and play them in your own mini-Carc landscape.  When you do, you may activate that tile and any tiles within a one-tile radius.  This gives you resources which you can convert to VP.  There is more to it, obviously, but I think it is really well put together.

I do enjoy the tile-laying mechanism and the various paths you can take to gain VP.  It's not overly thinky, but there is definitely strategy in this little game.  I really hope my family will latch onto this one.

[u]24-Jan-2014[/u]:  I finally got in a couple of multiplayer games of this one, and I still think it's a fantastic game.  Not sure how much my family enjoyed it, so I don't know if it'll see the table all that much.  But personally, I think this is a solid entry into the Eurogame realm with tile-laying, a spacial aspect to consider, and a 7 Wonders feel to the resource management / point scoring system.  With the small box and lower price tag, it's a good one to have in the collection.  Just hope I can play it more often.

A resource engine builder game with many familiar mechanics yet a unique feel.  It uses the Neuland turn order mechanic where you can choose a purchase tile as far up as possible but you don't get to take your turn again until everyone else has passed you.  There are a number of different combinations one can build and each player must manage their actions by placing bought tiles on a personal map which triggers adjacent tiles.  Later in the game resources can be used to make other resources (whiskey for example).  I haven't seen any dominant strategy yet.

*Jan 2013* After having played this game 3 times, I'm starting to see the depth I always felt was there. Like any good Euro, you have to keep readjusting your goals based off what your opponents keep doing and how their meddling gets in your way. Like any good economic game, there is real value in specializing what others aren't. Need to play it more to see if there isn't one path to victory but I don't think there is and I think it's a game that will see a lot of play. 

I really love Homesteaders for many of the same reasons but that one has more bits and is less portable. I'm glad I own both!

Great game.

Played once with 5 people.  It was the first game for everyone I played with, and the scores were incredibly tight (36 - 46, with four of us between 40 and 45).  

This game is filled with very neat mechanics.  Players choose a tile to place on their map; they can only place tiles near where they have meeples, and only tiles adjacent to the one they just placed activate.  So, spatially arranging your tiles in an optimal order is absolutely essential.  

Also, the order in which you choose tiles varies greatly, and so players may end up with a different number of turns.  This is elegantly balanced out at the end-game scoring, and leads to widely different strategies being successful.

All in all a very neat, meaty game that I want to play again.

Ez az egyetlen kizárólag német nyelvű játékom. Ez a verzió volt kapható itthon, ezért vásárlás előtt meggyőződtem róla, hogy tuti nem jelent e gondot a nyelv. Egyáltalán nem! Úgyhogy senkit ne tántorítson el a német nyelv ettől a társastól (nem tudok németül jómagam).
A játék elemei igencsak kicsik, de ez teszi a játékot "cukivá és barátnő kompatibilissé". Még csak párommal játszottunk ketten Glen More-t, szerencsére tetszett neki is. Valószínűleg azért, amit én is szeretek benne: a játék csak jutalmaz. Építgetjük a saját kis városunkat, és közben arra törekszünk, hogy minél több dologhoz jussunk, és szinte bármit teszünk, valamit mindenképpen kapunk.
Egy parti hamar lemegy, bár barátnőm hajlamos sokat gondolkodni, úgyhogy emiatt kicsit megnő a játékidő (1-1,5 óra). A harmadik "robot" játékos szerintem kell, mert izgalmat visz a játékba,  hiszen sosem lehetünk benne biztosak, hogy megkaparintjuk e a kiszemelt lapocskát.

Szeretném kipróbálni még több fővel, de egyértelműen sokra hivatott, még nőhet a pontszám

The clever central tile selection mechanism is what makes this game stand out. Players will move freely around a ring of tiles, picking up the ones they want as they go, but if you jump too far ahead, players behind you may get multiple turns in a row... since the person at the back of the line always goes first. It plays fairly quick. Traded in anticipation of the revised version scheduled for 2017/2018 release.

I've only played this online as it seems to be out of print. I'm tempted to track down Lunarchitects (the ill-fated reskin of this game that received then lost the blessing of Matthias Cramer) because the theme of the original is so arbitrary and it looks kind of crummy. (Kind of like Castles of Burgundy, also from Ravensburger: a bunch of grim little tiles.) -- That said, the gameplay here is really smart, with some unusual quirks, and it plays super fast. The most interesting aspect is that the midgame penalizes you for falling behind in various categories (chieftains, special cards, whiskey)--but if you just grab a ton of stuff you'll be even more penalized at the end, because there's a stiff penalty for being greedy for tiles: minus 3 points per tile in excess of the SMALLEST fiefdom of the other players. (Thus if one player ends the game with 12 tiles and you have 18, you are penalized 6 x 3 = 18 points.) I appreciate games that make you play smart rather than greedy--if you grab a lot of stuff you have to actually make it EARN points to overcome the offset.

I have played this game twice and I definitely like it. Beyond the fact that the game theme involves distilling whiskey and you gain victory points by activating a tavern, I really like the mechanic where you chose your next tile. I have been frustrated numerous times playing other tile games where I end up drawing tiles I can not use. There is a lot of tactics involved in deciding what tiles you can use and what tiles your opponent may want.

I also like the fact that you must plan ahead several moves so that you properly lay the tiles in the correct places in your tableau. Plus, you must move you meeples in the right spots. 

Gaining victory points based on differences in the number of whiskey barrels, special places and chieftains, is a unique twist and keeps people from focusing on one strategy to win the game.

A game very simple in rules but very deep in strategy and game-play.

An excellent, innovative mechanic. Too much downtime with 5 players, rating would probably go up if I played it with fewer players. The theme is pasted on & feels a bit dry. The different activation combos can and will get too complex for me, so I'd probably like it more solo or as a two-player game, when I can really think without annoying the other players with my slowness. I hear it's best with 4, but I'd probably like fewer players.

Interesting mechanics, but a rather simple resource management at heart. Scoring seems to be a bit unbalanced - the marketplaces are much stronger sources for victory points than the actual three scoring rounds. Also, too few materials included for four players or more which often forces you to substitute resources with different things.

From the moment I saw the sheep on the box, the game was in my wishlist. When I realized that sheep had a little to do with the theme, I wasn't dissappointed at all because the game is very balanced, though it has some luck in it.
The interesting aspect of it, is the way that players take turns over the tiles on the board.

RATING: N/A
I had heard a lot of positive things about this simple and compact game with its innovative action mechanisms. However, chally's excellent motivation for rating Glen More a 3 put me off completely.

(Quote from his review: "The idea of the game is that players move their meeple around a circular, tile-filled track, selecting tiles and adding them to their own individual tableau. Each time a new tile is added, that tile plus all surrounding tiles are activated (in the order of the player's choice). For those of you who have had the chance to play London, tile activation creates a fair bit of lonely downtime that is reminiscent of a player running a large city. The difference, of course, is that in Glen More this happens for every player on every turn of the game. A typical turn might involve (1) staring at the board weighing options, (2) selecting a tile, (3) staring at your tableau to decide where to put it, (4) placing the tile, (5) activating an adjacent tile that produces wheat, (6) activating an adjacent tile that produces cow, (7) activating an adjacent tile that produces stone, (8) using the newly placed building to change the wheat into a whisky barrel, (9) activating an adjacent building to convert the meat into VP, (10) selling the quarry to the market for 3 coins.")

Still, I'd like to see the action selection mechanism in... well, action.

A wonderful game, combining Carcassonne style tile laying with building a little economic community.  Does the job of 'too many decisions, not enough time' very well, and the theme is charmingly integrated.  I find this hits a sweet spot of moderate complexity and length, and works wonderfully in two, which is how I usually play.  Picked this up second hand, not really knowing what it was, but I am very glad I did, even though I cannot seem to figure out how to win.

The rules are easy, the game play is surprisingly deep consider the easy rules and small amount of components. The market mechanism is one of the best implementation ever - it's easy to understand, yet it works in this game by adding an interactive element to an otherwise personal engine building game. This will be the game that would get played often because it's portable and finishes within an hour with deep strategies.

RATING: 7.5
As the head of a Scottish clan in the 17th century, your turn consists of choosing a tile from the display and adding it your display. Your new tile has to go adjacent to a clan member, and you get to activate all adjacent tiles. If you race ahead in the display to grab tiles, other players can grab more tiles behind to catch up.

Tiles give resources, give VPs, or give you special abilities. There are three scoring rounds, when the tile deck in each round runs out. You then compare your whisky production, your chieftians and special cards to everyone else to score VPs. At the end game, you get penalized 3 VP per tile to the person with the lowest number of tiles. 

It's a fun game, with agonizing decisions on which tile to take and which tiles to activate. You don't have enough resources to do everything and always replayable with the order the tiles come out. I enjoy this game.

I enjoyed the game play, but concerned that there's a big imbalance in the strategies. The payouts just don't match the investments for some things (having more items than other players), and others feel too powerful (the cards which let you trade in cubes each round). I would gladly play it again, but would need to be convinced that there are multiple paths to victory. ***UPDATE*** A second play showed a lot more depth, and I really enjoyed the game. I am looking forward to more plays.

Sleeper hit of 2011. Ok. So the cover is meh. The theme is meh. The illustrations are meh. The board, tiles, etc. are all meh. And I really hate green. But this game rocks. Really. This game has shown the designer, Matthias Cramer to be one to look out for in the coming years. He has since followed up with Lancaster (just got a copy) and Helvetia (highly rated @ Essen 2011). The placement of tiles, activating them and scoring really sets this game apart. Plus it plays at most 60 mins. Perfect for lunch time gaming.  One thing that really appeals to me is you can pick a particular strategy and ride it all the way to the end... this is something I really like. I hate having to "diversify" (or play everything) to win. The only problem (if it is one) is that experienced players can really hammer newbies.

RATING: 5
Decisions in Glen More are limited to choosing to take the next available tile or jump ahead to a tile you may want more and lose out on a turn or two, and where to place the newly acquired tile. Other decisions are essentially resource management.

The best feature of the game is its closed economy as prices of goods are based on player demand rather than an arbitrary figure.

With less than 4 players the game requires a dummy player represented by a die. Given how little actual player interaction there is in this game, one could conceivably play solo with 3 dummy dice and get a similar play experience. Unfortunately, with GM’s closed economy, the Dummy can remove certain resources from play early on that will cause shortages throughout the game.

I wonder if the Scots would be offended by the characterization of their heritage being reduced to sheep & cattle farming and whiskey production. Probably not, but if so I'm sure they'll just drink it off ;)

This game was on my radar, although I was not too keen on it.  I am glad I played it now because there are some very unique mechanics in this game.  Most scoring is done by what you own compared to what your opponents own, so I have 1 whiskey, you have 5 whiskey, the difference is 4 and you look on the table to see how many points 4 is worth.  To acquire tiles whenever your meeple is the last in line you can move it to any tile you want, but be careful, because in the end if you have the most tiles you score -3 points for every tile more you have over the opponent with the least.  

The game felt very fresh, had lots of strategy, and played pretty quickly.

I get the similarities to Alhambra and why it's a better game. There's a few different paths to victory, and it's important not only to get and utilize good combos for yourself but to prevent others from doing the same, adding a bit of depth to the proceedings. Still, the first play (4er) felt a little dry with not as much there as it would seem. I think I need to play it more to appreciate the game.

Tile placement VP engine entirely based on the Jenseits von Theben turn order system.

I am very bad at this game, but I think anyway it is a good one.
Put together a rondel, tile placement, worker placement, a closed market economy and a very exotic scoring mechanism (score for a player is calculated based on the difference between that player and the player with the least amount of scoring item) and you get Glen More!

Glen More is firmly rooted in the very familiar domain of tiles with special properties, wooden cubes, money, intricate scoring and a tagged-on topic: this time players progress along a track collecting tiles for their own display, laying them according to the positions of figures that move on top of them. Victory points can be increased by certain majorities at definite scoring rounds or by exploiting the properties of your display while the game evolves. The best results should be achieved with as few tiles as possible. The beautiful and slightly humorous setting is distilling whisky in Scotland.

Among these well-balanced and rather comfortable ingredients there is, though, one surprising mechanic that sets Glen More apart from the myriad of games in its genre - the player to move is always the last one on the track. This little kink makes the acquisition of tiles for your own display a more complicated affair, since players can have several moves in a row to develop their own displays; they might be penalised for the amount of tiles later on, but in turn that might not matter anymore considering the powerful machine they've helped build...

Gioco che non sono riuscito a farmi piacere malgrado l'indubbia profondità e strategia. Adoro il suo autore e anche Glen More ha apparentemente tutti gli elementi per essere un valido gioco, a me però non diverte e non mi immedesima. Trovo l'astrattezza e l'aridità prevalere sul gioco e coprire il tentativo di ambientazione. E' vero che questo aspetto è presente in molti giochi ma Glen More è un titolo che ho rivenduto senza alcun pentimento e tutt'oggi non ho particolare piacere nel riprovarlo.

RATING: 8.5
I'm dabbling here somewhere between a game that could have lots of potential, and something that's just too random and unmanageable to be taken seriously. On the surface of things, there seems to be one too many VP-earning factor, and there's a routine 'going through the motions' to the gameplay that doesn't quite click. There can be an awful lot of downtime and fiddling with cubes, which sort of highlights the worst aspects of Euro-gaming.

On the other hand, the theme seems to make surprising sense, and the resource balancing will keep everyone involved until the final score tally. Doing sneaky stuff like locking up the market and hogging certain resources is very admirable.

Further Thoughts: Well, it was good enough for me to pimp my own version with some proper Resource-eeples and a dinky little storage tray. And it plays pretty swiftly with two or three. I guess it's a keeper now.

Well worth the $20 bucks I spent on it.  A note about the production quality.  I have the Rio Grande version - the rules are poorly proofed nor well written, and the components are on the flimsy side - not a quality effort (see price point above), however, it's a fun game that has an unique movement and scoring technique.  Easy to teach, but has a bit of depth to it.

The theme is primary production in Scotland, with a heavy emphasis on Whiskey. Excellent. Gameplay focuses on selection of new land areas (tiles) using a "you can't go back" mechanism similar to [i]Egizia[/i]. Tile placements follow rules similar to [i]Carcasssonne[/i] and generate production. Materials are processed by each players points-production-mechanism (their tile array) and generate victory points or improvements that score big at the end. It's a Euro!
And it is a very, very good Euro too. As is often the case, the principal player interaction comes through blocking moves- but in Glen More these are easy to find and often quite vicious. Turns involve a lot of decisions (what tile to take, where to place it, how to use the resources) but since these choices often impact other players, everyone will be attentive and interested. The game clicks along at a good pace.

COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8 -> 8)[/COLOR]

[i]I've been lucky enough to play this a few more times even though I don't own a copy. After three plays I've seen multiple strategies lead to victory as long as you focus your efforts. Glen More is definitely not a point salad game, if you try and do a little of everything you won't do well. The special tiles add another opportunity to find ways to get even more out of the engine you've built. Of course all of this is easier said than done because of the tile placement/activation rules surrounding the game. Glen More is one of those games that manages to achieve the perfect balance
  
Last year I thought Glen More was getting a reprint, but in fact it is actually going to be a 2.0 version that appears to still be a ways off. For now I am content to play my buddy's copy any time it hits the table and wait and see what Cramer has in store for the second version of Glen More when it's released.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I was very excited to finally play Glen More, it's been on my radar since I got into the hobby almost four years ago. However; it went out of print before I decided to get a copy so it took a while to finally get the opportunity to play. 

Now that I've played both Glen More and Kraftwagon I definitely prefer the game play of Glen More. I compare both games because they share a similar mechanic when it comes to determining player order. There is basically a rondel of sorts and you can move forward as far as you want along the track, but it won't be your turn again until everyone else's markers are ahead of yours. This makes for some agonizing choices in Glen More because there are times when you really want to jump ahead and not worry about how many possible tiles the players behind you will get. Also Glen More will penalize you if you just take every tile others have passed since you can lose a lot of points depending on how many more tiles you have compared to the person with the least. I felt like this balancing mechanism was missing in Kraftwagon and it almost always made sense for the other player to take every action the previous player skipped over (which is especially true in the 2p game). 

Besides that I just found the decisions you make in Glen More to be more interesting. The combination of tile laying with the need to have a worker on an adjacent tile to place it makes for a strategic game where you need to plan ahead so you don't create a tableau of tiles where it is no longer possible to activate the tiles you need to. In the end I'm very glad D=Glen More is getting a second edition and I'll be picking up a copy once it becomes available.[/i]

Not bad, had the feel of Carcassonne and Settlers, though I expect that was more due to the resources, meeples, tile edge matching and maybe artwork/theme. Also I felt there were little elements from Shipyard (circular main rondell), Thebes/Year of the Dragon time track, Homesteaders (resource conversion buildings).

Innovative mechanics (the tile laying and the central market), though I didn't like the scoring system, it rewards lots of little things at the end/during scoring rounds and lots of little tactical opportunities to gain a few points here and there, with no real scoring bombs.

Cool tile laying game.  When playing it felt a little empty but I had some good decisions.  The more I thought about the game afterward I really like its simplicity.  It bring something a little different to the table and I would like to play it again soon.  The timing of turns is similar to Neuland.  I think the reason I was a little put off at first was the fact that the game forces you to diversify, and games like this I would rather create my own unique engine.  There is a little wiggle room, you just have to keep up on the three or four scoring categories so you don't give away 5-8 points to the rest of the players.

A tile collection game a la Vikings where the tiles you choose are placed carefully into your display, but it has layers of complexity wrought over and around it to produce a more thoughtful (but less fun) beast. Choose any tile on the track you like - some will be free, others will require cubes to purchase. Place it into your display next to one of your meeples (which eventually need to move around to provide you future places to build), and then trigger not only the tile you score, but every tile around it as well. Tile actions may be to generate cubes (ie the currencies), trade cubes in for vp's, get/move a meeple, and so on. Each turn is a consideration of placement for now (what's everything that will trigger), and to plan for future turn triggerings (what am I aiming to collect in future to take advantage of this placement now). That leads into your master VP earning strategy and more specifically what VP races you want to be part of and which to ignore (most meeples, most whisky, etc) which will score three times throughout. You'll only get 7 to 12 turns say (depending on how far you leap ahead to claim tiles on the display), so each turn is important and must complement previous and future turns. All good stuff. But there's so much to consider, including determining the likelihood of the tile you want next being left by the others, that the downtime can be a real turnoff, especially if you've down a leapahead and you're waiting for the others to work through multiple turns until they all pass you again. With 4 players we found it too slow, so will restrict to less in future. A very tight game, well produced, but be prepared for a slow game, and this cruelled it for me in the end.

One of my Top 10 !! Perfect City/Farm Building Economic Variable-Turn-Order Rondel Tile Game !! I love this game !! Plays 2-5 players under 90 minutes. Feels like a lighter version of Homesteaders without the auctions and the debts.

Replayabiliity through the randomness of the tiles to select on the rondel, and through differing strategies. Still, players must be flexible in order to win.

RATING: 5
It's a clever, well-designed game, but I'm lowering my rating from 7 to 5. I love the turn order mechanic, and that it is non-confrontational, but maybe tile-laying isn't my thing. I don't like the majority aspects of chieftans, whiskey, or special cards, and I don't like the potential complexity of tile activations.

There is definitely a risk of AP, but if you don't optimize it can go pretty quickly. I liked that a 4p with 2 first-timers only took 90 minutes, but the optimizer won.

I would be willing to play again, but I won't suggest it. Although mechanically it works fine with 2p (the random tile grabber is fine), it is definitely less interesting. I think the 2.7 weight is about right.

RATING: 8.5
You follow around a track, with the player in the back being the current player and you move around collecting buildings to place in your city. You must try and achieve majority in several goods and other items, while using as few buildings as possible. You get points, either from your buildings or at one of the three scorings where you get points by being ahead in one item versus your opponents. A fairly fun game with not too many complex mechanics that newer games can even join in with ease.

RATING: 7
  Play is smooth and quick with meaningful decisions as to which tiles to take and where to build them.  Points can be scored at the end of each phase as well as when certain tiles are activated.  There are enough ways to score points to allow for the development of strategy.  The game scales very easily from 2 to 5.  The dummy "dice" player that is used for 2 or 3 players does not detract from the game at all.  In fact I think it is necessary.  Highly recommended game.

I was not expecting to like this game, but I did like my first play.  It was described to me as an engine-building game and that sounded distasteful and not fun.  Well, there was a bit of thinking required, but it was fun nevertheless.  The scoring method, based on how much more of something you have compared to the player with the least, is surprisingly interesting.

A very good game. Interesting and different. In the "short but not-so-light" category.

Rules have a bit of a learning curve. And rulebook is inexcusably un-thorough and vague on several points.

Three plays so far, we'll see if my rating rises over time.

A fine little euro.  This is a sweet game that plays in an hour.  Its well put together and there is a lot going on.  The tile draft is the best part, but I also love the tile placement, scoring, and multiple small VP engines.  Each of the above listed aspects is innovative in some small way, and the game feels fresh.  It has a simple, closed free-market economy that is robust enough that the game doesn't break even if there is an unexpected surfeit or shortage of a commodity.

Strategically, the key is to compete in at least one, or better yet two, of the three scoring categories (hats, barrels, real estate), and ALSO have at least one brown-tile VP engine going. But it is very possible to win by specializing.

Its thematic in the euro tradition.  I think its lovely.  You can make some scotch!  Its far more thematic than Goa, which might be Glen More's closest comparison.  It main thematic fault is that in the game you need wheat to make scotch.  That's wrong: scotch is made from barley!!  

Glen More scales well from two to five although three and four are the best counts.  The dummy player, for 2 and 3 handed games, is very simply integrated into the game–it actually makes the game better rather than worse. 

The rulebook could have been larger. The type is small. In fact the whole game could have been printed a wee bit larger. I normally hate over-boxed and over-produced games, but this one deserves a little more cardboard.

There are a lot of interesting concepts in this tile-laying game.  The tile selection felt like a combination of Egizia and Thebes--you can't move backwards, and the person furthest behind in the queue always goes next, potentially getting more tiles.  Tiles activating upon placement really helps streamline the turns.  Getting more tiles can be good and bad--you get more activations and potentially more points, but the game penalizes you at the end for number of tiles, so you need to make sure they're at least worth that much.  I liked this a lot, and look forward to playing more.

(5+ plays)

It has very tight strategy based on efficiency, which I like.  It has good turn mechanics.  I like the city building and resource collections.  There are many paths to win.

The game I too hastily traded! This is a nice small game I should have not of got rid of. In this game you are building your own town. There is a track and when your last on that track you decide which building you want, the catch is that the tile you want may not be available on your next turn, so do you get the tile and miss out on some potential turns. It's a nice, unique (as far as my gaming goes), mechanic with only one problem! If you go too far away you have too much down time. Not a massive problem but still there. I really enjoyed the themes of the castles and whiskey. The main reason I traded this game was because I had the German version and would have enjoyed a game with English text. If I drank the whiskey in this game maybe it would be a blur and I wouldn't mind so much.

Didn't make the cut as I am xenophobic to foreign languages. XHEfnvfHBIT

I've read the rules twice, but this seems to be a game like Puerto Rico and Agricola where you have to stumble through a couple learning games first to understand how it all comes together.  I couldn't figure out Puerto Rico by reading the rules, but once I played the online computer version, it was a breeze.  I hope someone comes out with a computer version of Glen More -- it might take that for me to learn it.

葛蘭摩爾(Glen More)一聽名就知道是啥主題的根本不重要的歐式桌遊，你要經營一個大型農莊...............遊戲的特色在取得版塊的方式和拼板塊兩件事上面，版塊(建築)都環繞在版圖上任君挑選，想跳很多格去搶自己想要的版塊，可以!只是代價是下次要等很久才輪的到你動作，因為在棋子在後面的玩家先動，那一直慢慢動不就好了嗎?No~~因為遊戲最後拿越多版塊扣越多分哪!!糾結......至於拼板塊特色在版塊放下去就可以啟動四周8個方向的版塊功能，聽起來好爽!!!不過前提是......你版塊要放得下去XD。總之這遊戲還不錯規則不難時間也還好

This is a huge step up from Carcassonne. In Carc you don't really plan where to put the tile until you draw them, but in Glen More you have to think ahead how to build the most efficient town you can ever get. The -3 VP per extra tile forces people to not only plan ahead, but not spam things that on the surface seems like a good idea to earn VP, but later give back the VP since other people has less tile than you. This is definitely not a gateway game for my gf and family. I can see the rating goes up once we are done with less meatier games.

Read its PDF manual and played few games in yucata.de. The feeling is cool and it has some elements like 7 Wonders but seems can be controlled more by the players.

2013-11-4 --- Played 100 games in yucata.de and still find it is an interesting game, still want to play more. It has many ways to win when playing 2-P game while playing 3-P game seems will be affected a lot by others' choices. Feel "Rich" in 2-P while feel "Poor" in 3-P or more player mode. If can have more resource title in multiplayer mode, will make the player more happier.

RATING: 7
This is a solid game, where players walk their meeple in a circle taking tiles, which they add to their board based on certain placement rules, then they activate the ability of the tile they took and all tiles surrounding it. The player who is standing at the back of the line is the active player, so at times players might jump ahead for a strong tile, but then lose out on a turn. The scoring is based on comparing your scoring resource to the person who has the least of that resource, so it's good to specialize if you can. Lots of fun, very intelligent game, however this game does suffer from component problems, iconography unclarity and a few unclear special buildings.

I had a feeling Glen More might be the kind of Euro I hate, and I was right. The couple of nice ideas it has are buried underneath a bland VP salad; exacerbated by long, fiddly turns that are of no interest to anyone but the active player. Could easily be a Feld.

Only played solitaire - great fun! I love engine building, and tiles are great too. It's fun to try and get different strategies to work, and simple enough that it isn't too hard to solo a two-player game. It is also possible to play a real solo, though if using the die as in a two player game you may end up with much fewer tiles than otherwise. 

Update: now also 2 two-player games. Very happy to have this one in my collection.

Delightful tile laying game.  I love the tile selection mechanic, which also determines turn order.  Good variety of tile options on what to include in your clan’s territory- meadow, pasture, quarry, wheat, distillery, castle, village, butcher, tavern, etc.  Do you build a large territory that will hopefully not crush your victory points at the game end, or do you stay small and hope to sneak in a victory??  There’s whiskey barrels too!

I like the way it uses turn order, jumping ahead to grab a tile, can prevent you from having turn for a while. However, being too much of a bottom feeder has it penalty as well.

It is another of the points engine game where you have to commit early to how you will churn out the points. Don't mind playing but not a game I would suggest.

I really wish I could give this a higher score, as I really like the underlying systems, but when I played this with my wife, sister-in-law, and wife's best friend, this game sank for all three. The reactions of all three women was surprisingly negative, with my wife claiming that she has no interest in ever playing again.

I believe that four may not be the sweet spot for the game, and that it may play better with two or three. With four or five I think there is just too little opportunity to get good tiles before they are snatched up by other players. Still, this will always be more tactical than strategic.

Interesting mechanism for turn order; skipping turns gives penalty for others. Fairly different strategies seem to work well, and the game plays quite quickly -- what more could one want? Maybe the special tiles that score points in the end are a bit too strong, and who gets them is partly based on luck of draw.

An interesting and quick playing Post-Carcassone variant (which resembles 20th Century quiet a bit). I like the theme, despite being very light. A handful of nice balancing mechanics make the game interactive enough to be interesting, although I would have prefered - again - if players would build on the same landscape instead of creating your own little Scotland in front of you.

I tend to enjoy tile-building games whether it is on a shared board or on individual tableaus. I enjoy determining how far to jump and the tiles to get, managing your area size and making sure you're not going to be penalized for additional tiles over the smallest player, and timing things to take advantage of the three scoring rounds. For me the defining element of this game is the quick play as we can usually play in about 30-45 minutes and I get a lot of the satisfaction I get in longer games like Ora et Labora.

RATING: N/A
I don't think I "get" optimization games like Glen More and Dominion. I can understand them and win them, but they're not fun. Or maybe they're just not fun for two players.

Glen More failed for us for the same reasons the base Dominion did, and in fact they feel like the same game. You pick a strategy early on (butcher, whisky, variety (fairs), special tiles, etc) and then work through the mechanics of the game until you reach an arbitrary end condition (last tile has been placed) to see if your strategy was more optimal than that of your opponents. Aside from taking a tile the other person wanted or clogging up the market in one way or another, there's almost no direct conflict or interaction between players. I can watch what you're doing and react to it, but mostly I'm just going to do my thing while you do yours and hope mine works better.

I think we prefer games with a victory goal (Battleline = three flags in a row; Hive = surround the queen; Catan = first to 10; Attika = first to make a path or place all tiles; Barons = first to build a cathedral; etc) or at least where the score is more open and obvious as you go along (Bohnanza; Carcassone without farmers).

Going to give it another shot before passing judgement. I want to be wrong about this game and games like it. I want to learn to like these games.

UPDATE: The store where we bought this has a fantastic return policy. We took it back. I think the game was mechanically excellent and if we liked games /like/ this, we'd probably very much like this game. That said, it just wasn't for us and I'm not going to give it a rating.

June 2017: Downgrade fro 6 to 3

Too many rules for what the game is. I'm losing patience with these kinds of games. As with so many Euros, it's really about playing the system and much less about playing against other players.

At least it still plays relatively quickly.

March 2016: A pleasant surprise (as I'm not a fan of Euros in general).

There are a lot of mechanisms in this game, and they work quite tightly together: turn order dictated by which tile you drew, restrictive tile laying, supply-and-demand mechanism, and lots and lots of special powers. Surprisingly smooth play! Still, the tile laying rules I find a bit too overly complicated.

But like many Euros, the game rewards players who focus on their own strategies rather than getting in the way of others. 

The Thebes-like mechanism of determining turn order is strange here; you're rewarded more for taking less turns than more. So if there's a tile you really want, you go ahead and get it; you don't wait to hopefully get extra turns.

Played 2x but so far it is very fun. There is some strategy and some tactics and some interesting tableu building. Time will tell how well this lasts. 

-May 2012

I really didn't dig Glen More. It has this mechanic I found annoying in which you move your pawn forward along the tile market. The pawn that is furthest back goes first and can either skip ahead past some or all opponent pawns or or move to and purchase a tile that is behind some or all opponents. Thus impacting how many tiles they will get compared to opponents and impacting turn order. 

It was always hard to decide whether to move far past opponents to lock down a highly desired tile or to wait and hope they don't hate draft it from you. I don't enjoy hate drafting or being inefficient and this game made you risk one or the other. :(

Many people seem to like the tension that decision requires. Not me...

Alea medium box games are consistently...interesting? Anyway, this one is too. Variable ways to score and win, and while you do play solo you need to keep an eye on other player's chieftains, whiskey barrels and castles. Few different ways to score your points too, so it keeps it interesting. Strong entry for Alea.

I really like Glen More, it is pretty unique as far as my experience goes. It has interesting decisions as well as clever and novel mechanics. I find the the theme light but satisfying and always love a good economic game. The scoring mechanics are also very interesting, you have your buildings which convert resources directly into victory points and then you have the long term scoring mechanisms of whiskey, chieftains and cards. I walk away from this one satisfied and fulfilled in the relatively short time it takes to play.

Pleasant as a two-player game, but unexceptional: there are better games that offer a similar experience. (Carcassonne for tile placement, Shipyard for the circular track mechanism, and so on.)

Tile collection, placement, and activation for the production of goods, which can be collected for victory points, sold for money, etc. The innovation in this game is the unique turn order mechanic (seemingly inspired by Peter Prinz's Thebes, and with some similarities to that in Tikal II), which allows the player "furthest back" in the chain of tiles to continue to take turns until they are no longer last. This may encourage taking less optimal tiles in order to get another turn; however each selected tile must be placed in a legal (and sometimes optimal, because it activates all tiles around it) open space in the player's display, removing that space for a future tile.

this game was awesome.  A pure euro at heart however with a thin theme but we were happy there was a theme their rather than it be purely abstract.  This is kind of, in my mind, a cross between Alhambra, Thebes, and with resource management thrown in.  Great w/ two and a real brain burner.  You build city-type area via tile placement rules, you get resources based on various parameters and you use these resources to attempt to better your opponents victory points in various parameters. however, as in Thebes the more aggressive you are at getting tiles the more opportunity you give to you opponents because they may get more turns than you.  A really brain burner.  Pretty easy rules but superb depth with the game.  After three plays, this really is a tactical strategy game.  You need to determine a strategy a some point but it's needs to be done sometime in the middle round.  Incredible game that seems to play differently each time.

Jan. 2015: Tough to judge after just one play.  Not sure if part of the reason I like it is that it's in short supply.  I really like the design, though, and would like to try it again.  Our game (2 newbies and a veteran) was very unusual market-wise because we weren't selling many things back to the market.

Glen More is a resource management, tile-laying eurogame with a neat little market mechanism and a novel turn-order mechanism. The game scales well between player counts with the ghost player die an interesting mechanism to balance the lower player counts. 

The quick playtime is the redeeming factor here; there's a lot going on but not that many interesting decisions.

A tile laying game with an interesting drafting mechanic. 

You can get the tile you want when it appears, but that may be at the cost of effectively missing your next few plays!

Not too heavy, but careful forethought is useful

(+) Easy to explain and understand.
(+) Limited play time, yet offering enough depth en strategic and tactical opportunities.
(+) Interesting scoring mechanic (3x scoring in different types of resources relative to other players). The rondel system to take actions makes for a fine game engine. I can see different strategies working in this game.
(+) Opportunities for some engine building.

(-) Theme is pasted on, this is a very mechanical game.
(-) Maybe it is due to a lack of experience, but certain lakes seem too powerful (like the lake allowing to activate each and every tile and which comes out at the end of the game).
(-) Some chaos/luck dependence with tile draws.

Interesting turn order mechanic... I like tableau building games in this vein, although I am not so sure about the combo aspect that can be triggered with some placements. Some special locations can also have wild effects and while they do pop up ahead of time they sometimes give me the impression that they can give the game to the player lucky enough to play next after they appear.

I debated briefly on whether I prefer Glen More or Homesteaders. Despite the differences between the two, both feel like quintessential efficiency engine games.

In the end, I decided I prefer Glen More. Homesteaders has a fairly convoluted trading element that Glen More does not. Glen More also has a spatial aspect in deciding where tiles are placed.

rating after 1 play - 4pl - 5/6

felt like someone had a cpl of ideas for game mechs and simply applied a generic eurogame brush to them - turns out i dont like the central mechs so it was just multiplayer solitaire - worse thing though is if u skip ahead on the tile track (which the game scoring ENCOURAGES you to do) then u have to wait for other ppl to take multiple turns before u can play again - and other ppls turns are v v dull to watch ^^

RATING: 7
Multiple ways to score points and the differential scoring means that one just needs to score enough in any of those ways to gain the max points.  This means that different players will be working on different goals.  But one needs to be efficient as the number of tiles in one's tableau is also a scoring unit.  And then one needs to time one's end as one should clear off the tableau (buying all available goods, moving workers to clan leaders) at the end to maximize game end scoring.

Ugh, this game was a bore. I don't really see how this game is rated so well. The tiles are all improperly balanced and it becomes luck as to who can get what tile.

An Alea small box game that deserves the big box treatment. The components are serviceable, but thicker tiles would have been nice.

The novel turn-order mechanic is a pretty interesting take on the Thebes time track. It creates some tough decisions based on assessing the desirability of a tile, and how many turns is it worth giving up in exchange. The warehouse is fascinating, and it adds a few, minor economic considerations each turn in addition to added flexibility for tile purchases.

The area of each player will grow as tiles are added each turn. Placement alone provides for some interesting strategic play. There's no prescribed way for the land to grow, which allows for some creative tile actions.

Out of all the "no direct conflict" games I've played, Glen More seems to have the most player interaction out of them all. Each player has to keep track of scoring majorities and the current state of the warehouse.

Open ended with plenty of paths to victory, a nice little game that deserves to be the crown gem of the small box line.

--Jan2011-- Nice tile drafting exercise, with a tractable set of moving parts and reasonable play time.  Probably would work well for the Friday Lunch crew.  While I enjoyed my first play, I wonder a bit about destructive collisions between players:  might it be the case that the winner is simply the one whose path coincides the least with the opponents?

I like the dice as the third "player" in a two player game to add to the tough decisions and unpredictability. Genius. (It worked so well that they've picked it up to create a two-player alternative for Francis Drake.) 

This is now my favorite two-player game.

I appreciate the decisions of what to pick up and where to play it, and when to take the chieftains off of your map so that they can score. This is a thinking game all the way through.

Glen More was a pleasant surprise. I hadn't read any high praises about it beforehand but to me this is a very nice addition to the Alea collection. The tile laying mechanic gives this great replayability and there is a huge number of different combos available for 'pumping' points. They aren't necessarily apparent and also even if there is a huge number of options available at any given time it's quick to evaluate which is the best for me. Not a lot of strategic planning can be done. One must rather suit their strategy to which tiles become available and that suits me just fine. Will definitely play again.

Players must earn some victory points, doing his common job as a scottish clan leader, like whisky, butchery, etc, and increasing his own town, with some more villages, pastures, forests, etc.

Certainly one of my best games.

Even as an AT'er, I LOVE THIS GAME. :laugh:

Sure, there's no plundering or fighting (or farms!), but drinking (distilleries), more drinking (taverns), slaughtering (butchers) and partying (annual faires) are part of the game. One of your men even "mysteriously disappears" (is paid as a cost) when you place the Loch Ness tile! The mechanics of the game are more intricate than some of the simpler Eurogames, yet you're not blindsided by some annoying arbitrary themeless mechanic.

As a newbie bonus, you can play the first round (each game has three rounds) as a 20-minute "practice round". All information is public, so it's easy to help other players.

BTW, We call the chieftans middle managers. They're worth points but don't actually do anything once they're promoted!

It's a lovely game of trying to create an efficient point making machine through tile selection. What elevates this variant of that mechanic is the somewhat inelegant, yet interesting tile placement system. You're trying to activate certain previously bought tiles by placing new tiles next to them. That's more difficult and challenging than it sounds. Another nice element to the game is the scoring mechanic. You're scoring points in three categories against the player with the fewest in that category. If you can engineer a nice jump on one opponent early in the game there's some points to rake in, but at what cost to your nicely balanced and planned village? Make points against the others, but find that they make them back in another category. It's thought provoking.

This scales well from 2-5 players, but plays differently. I was concerned with five players the control would be lost, but there's still plenty of tiles to choose from on your turn. The game comes in under an hour once you get the system of moving clan members around, what kinds of tiles are out there, how to get a production engine going, etc. There's a few different paths to victory with the markets and special tiles.

Downsides:
1. The 2 & 3 player games have a dummy player pinching random tiles. Some people might not like that.
2. Player interaction is lowish. Sometimes you'll take a tile because it's just too good to leave for another player. You'll cast an eye on what the others are up to and how they're scoring. On the whole though you're just playing your own game.

It's a very likeable game that will stand up to repeated playings. Good job Alea - this is perfect for your mid-box range - low to medium difficulty, playable in an hour, but a reasonably meaty offering (like Louis XIV). Well worth the price and doesn't hog the shelf space.

Upon further play I can't help but feel that the game would be a better one if there was not the three point penalty for each tile more than the person with the lowest number of tiles. Firstly, it would reduce some of the downtime players experience who go charging off to the front each turn. Secondly, it would make the decision of choosing your tiles just a bit harder - charging off to collect a good tile further ahead would no longer be the obvious move if there were a couple of semi-decent tiles along the way.

RATING: 8
Well integrated game that combines a mechanic similar to the turn order of [i]Thebes[/i] with the drafting of tiles. The way that tiles activate when you acquire them is also clever. And, of course, as an Eurogame the rest is getting and exchanging cubes to obtain other resources or victory points, with a majority type of scoring.

This is an interesting game that has a lot going for it.  The game play puts you to a lot of interesting decisions.  You have to balance how far you want to move along the track, where you need your people, what tiles you need, etc.  I much prefer this to, say, Carcassonne.  I like the art and think the color choices are good.  The play time is great and this is a game that could even be played at lunch.  The box size is nice too, not taking up too much space.  Anyone, good, fun game.

Fantastic. Just fantastic.

Admittedly somewhat visually unappealing, the originality of this game more than compensates. It's a mashup of tile placement, tableau building and resource management and... drafting?? So well done. Really, I love the powers of the special tiles and the tension between trying to collect the different chieftains, whiskey barrels and special locations.

If you want to play Alhambra - just play this. If you want to play Settlers - just play this. If you want to play 7 Wonders - just play this. Seems to satisfy a lot of urges at once.

RATING: 5
A pool-to-mat game reminiscent of Maori/Vikings/Factory Fun, but a lot more advanced than them due to having your tiles trigger an efficiency engine with 5-8 resources to juggle, a market driven by supply and demand, and a Thebes-like time track for variable turn order.

Adapted a lot of components from different games that don't fit together.

Here is one that I thought I would like and it turns out that I was right.  It has a cool little mechanic where travel around a track collecting tiles to improve your clan, but there is a rub - tiles occasionally have roads or rivers that must be legally placed.  You must place the tiles adjacent to a clan member and then the tile activates all of the tiles around it.  The market works pretty well too.  I don't mind the dummy player when you have only 3, but I think the game shines when you have at least 4.  It's an enjoyable game and one that I look forward to playing again.

A good Euro with a non-standard turn order. You should be able to calculate exactly how many turns you have left long before the game ends and plan accordingly. If you don't, you'll be surprised at how fast it ends.

RATING: 7.5
Played three times over the course of 5 years. Glen More hits a number of right notes for me for being a relatively small and quick game packed with tricky decisions. Its turn order track is the primary attraction – there is so much angst in jumping ahead to nab a good tile, and enduring the painful wait for your turn to roll around. But even those who meander behind have to watch out for the penalty that bites back for having too many tiles. Hah!

The other point of interest is the scoring system which gauges how well players are doing in accumulating particular elements (special cards, chieftains and whiskey barrels) in relation to other players. Depending on your position in the game, you'd sometimes want to close a scoring gap, and at other times widen another. The other considerations, such as the spatial element in triggering the effects of tiles and the mini-market for resources, fit nicely into the framework.

The only thing I wish for is that the size of the tiles and typeface be increased for legibility's sake. The gameplay is also admittedly a little dry and calculative at times, but otherwise Glen More is upper-tier material amongst the Alea medium box titles.

2013-2015: 9. Love this game, a nice collection of mechanics and lightly pasted theme with a tight closed economic system.  Some of the tiles in the game are really powerful, but not game-breakingly so.  Definitely a game that rewards experienced players, new players will have a tougher time until they learn all the tiles and can plan more for the long term.  For a game this deep, it plays pretty quick too!

Not the light game I (for some reason) expected.  A lot of stuff to keep an eye on.  Long term strategy is important but due to an abundance of chaos, tactics come into play every turn.  Would like to try it with fewer players to see if this chaos becomes more manageable.

Any game where you get to distil whiskey has to be good, right? The rondel mechanism is really interesting and it's great how there are multiple routes you can take to get those VPs. I need to make some kind of tokens to remind everyone of their colour though, because it's surprisingly easy to forget.

Hű, ez a játék nagyon meglepett. Nem gondoltam volna egy ilyen kis doboz ilyen jó kis játékot rejt. Egy kis Carcassone beütésű városépítési játék. A játékosok egy nagyon jó kis mechanizmus alapján különböző lapkákat szereznek, amelyekkel termelhetnek különböző nyersanyagokat, illetve különböző bónuszokat adó épületeket építhetnek. Nagyon jó a lapkalehelyezési és termelési mechanizmus. Nagyon jó a pénz és piac megoldás is. Szinte minden eleme a játéknak nagyon jól kitalált és nagyon egyszerű. A játék gyors, öten se húzódik el. Többfajta út vezet a győzelemhez. Egyedül kritika a kivitelezést érheti. Minden nagyon kicsire sikerült. Egyes szimbólumokat már nehéz látni, de ez legyen egy játék legnagyobb gondja. Nagyon tetszett.

[2011-05-27]
Második játék után is tartom a fenti dolgokat, sőt még jobban tetszik, hogy tényleg többféle út vezet a nyeréshez és nagyon figyelni kell a többi játékost, milyen szinten terjeszkedik és mire megy. Nagyon jó kis pörgős játék.

Kipróbáltam hárman és ketten is. A kocka megjelenés néha hoz bosszús helyzeteket és némi szerencsefaktort, de a játék úgy tűnik minden játékosszám mellett jól működik.

Surprisingly deep game that would easily garner a 10 if the production value were higher.  The small stature of the board and bits, coupled with the thin cardboard, make for a 1-point ding.  Maybe a re-release with better components is in order?  One can hope.

Nice little Euro where you draft tiles with the Neuland/Jenseit/Tutankhamen system.  You create a little map with them based on landscape and the positioning of your workers.  Then you creatively produce resources by building tiles by previous tiles. 

Cute, with some worthwhile ways to try varying the way you build your "empire".  Certainly, a multiple paths to victory game.  There are three checks that pit your progress against other players, so it isn't a completely solitaire experience, but really the other players could be reproduced by a randomly generated number device (like, say, the die that does this exact thing in the two/three player game).

If you like converting cubes into victory points then this is a worthwhile place to do it.  If you are looking for more interaction other than losing out on drafting a tile now and again or comparing the size of your Parliament, then look elsewhere.

RATING: 8.2
This game has much more depth than most other "tile placement" games.  In fact, it plays much more like a boardgame.

The game is packed with tense tactical decisions such as which tile to select (and how that impacts others and your future turns), how to develop your village, where you wish your black meeple to be in your village and when you should start collecting chieftans.  It is short and quick and always leaves me wanting to play again ... 

I highly recommend this game.

Uh-oh.  I thought I would like this game.  I did not.  Glen More is so abstract and so tedious I wanted to quit before the end.  Perhaps I'm being too harsh with that sentence but by the time the end did come I got rather upset with the scoring system.  It's just not for me, I guess.

LOVE THIS TO DEATH!

It is such an amazing game. My only complaint is that i dont like to play this at higher play counts with really slow players. It can get really long at that point, and you may feel like you don't have much interaction at all with some of the other players. It is a very good two or three player game - really excellent with two. I would even play with 4, but never again with 5! 

The geometric element of placing your tiles in this game is great because it is very simple, and doesn't feel like it's a huge part of the game. Much of the game is on the shared board, as it is an excruciating choice sometimes whether to take a tile that you need, or to take a chance of someone else taking it. This choice is so great because of the very elegant mechanic that often you can take the tile you want, but that will mean that you wont get another turn for a while - brilliant! 

Love the theme, gameplay, and bits - all awesome in a little package too!

Cool tile placement game, much like an advanced Alhambra. However, the resource management aspects of this combined with the actions that you get to take by where you place your tiles really add for another layer of depth to make this a truly solid game worthy of being in my collection.

UPDATE: Have to move this up a bit, as I do really enjoy the combination of the resource management and tile placement.

RATING: 8
A unique game, combining tile laying, resource management, production facilities and a miniature internal marketplace, with a combination of familiar and novel mechanics.  A little involved to learn at the beginning, but becomes intuitive very quickly, and (admirably) has many different paths to victory.  There's a lot going on, for the size of the game and the very reasonable playing time.  Also features a very workable 2 and 3 player modification using a dummy player much better and more simply than many games.  A favourite.

This is, in essence, a fantastic medium weight economic game that is pretty quick to play. I loved it after one play and I love it even more after many plays.

This is a nice combination of tile laying (Alhambra style: build your own little area) with tile selection (sort of like Egizia: in one direction only) and turn order (like Neuland and Thebes: last player goes next).

Here, you're a Scottish clansman collecting tiles (they produce goods, give you more clansmen to work with, etc.) by moving your token forward along the path of tiles. Tile placement is also clever: you can place them adjacent to your meeple (assuming it fits otherwise). Placing a tile activates it and all 8 adjacent tiles -- cool! Tiles are not totally random; instead, they are grouped into 3 groups, and scoring happens after going through each stack. You score for a variety of things (e.g., number of whisky tokens, # of chieftains, etc.). In addition, at the end of the game you lose points for having collected too many tiles. Most points at the end wins. The player with the most points wins.

The game played pretty quickly and was full of little decisons along the way. Like Egizia, the simple choice of when to jump ahead and when to hang back provides plenty of tension. The tile-laying part is not terribly difficult -- you can find a spot for most tiles -- but you do have to plan for it by placing/moving your meeples appropriately. 

Good game, looking forward to playing it more!

I've only played twice, but it seems very good. Fiddly, lots of little things to keep track of, but also the possibility of working a good plan, and earning a well deserved win. Not truly elegant, the tile picking mechanic doesn't really balance the random nature of the tiles, but it helps a lot, making this much better than a card game with tiles might be.

RATING: 7
This is a tile-laying game where each player takes turns selecting a tile from a track and placing it in their own personal tableau.  Each tile has a different ability and placing a tile activates its ability as well as all surrounding tile abilities.  These abilities range from collecting resources (which are used to purchase tiles as well as some ability activations) to collecting points.  The point scoring is reasonably interesting where each player scores points based on the difference between their count of certain items and the player with the lowest count in that particular item.  But otherwise this is a reasonably run-of-the-mill tile-laying game.  Except for the turn order mechanism.

The player whose piece is furthest toward the back of the tile auction track always gets to go first.  That player can take any tile they like on the track whether it is simply one space ahead of their piece or all the way around the track.  This means the turn order is very variable and players can take multiple turns in a row or go several turns without getting one of their own if they jumped way ahead for a specific tile.

The one minor thing I think is pretty neat is because of this variable number and order of turns one player could potentially end up with many more tiles and thus ability activations than others.  The final scoring somewhat accommodates for this because each tile a player has over the player with the least LOSES them 3 points at the end of the game.

That turn order mechanic is really what elevates an otherwise pretty standard, dry, and honestly not that exciting tile-laying game.  The artwork is drab and the components aren't the best either.  But I really do enjoy that turn order mechanic enough to enjoy the game overall and give it a recommendation.

RATING: 10
Reasons I like this game:
-Good integration of theme and mechanics.
-Simple and effective market system allows exchange of goods and points.
-Interesting decisions each turn, and very tense downtime.
-Players are rewarded for planning ahead, but the game requires tactical finesse as well.
-There are multiple strategies that can win the game; learning them is fun and rewarding.
-The game can be played casually and competitively.
-The order the tiles appear is different each time; the game has high replay value.

Reasons I hate this game:
-The iconography on the tiles is rather small.
-Its not really a family game so I don't get to play very often.

TL;DR: One of the greatest euro-games in the genre. Highly replayable, deep, tense, strategic, tactical...In fact I could go for a game right now...

RATING: 5.5
"Glen More" does a lot of things that I like but nothing that really excites me. It has a more solitary feeling to it which can make the downtime between turns to a problem. Overall, I am not sure who to bring this game to the table with, for non-gamers there is way too much info in the beginning that needs to be memorized or looked up (what do all the different tiles do?), for a light game it is not easy enough, for a challenging game it doesn't go deep enough. Plus, the theme has nothing to do whatsoever with the game play.
All that said, I do like it though, it is a decent game but I am not sure I will play it much.

Interesting tile laying game.  Like many Euros it is glorified solitaire with the player interactions limited to scoring, using the market, and tile selection.

It is interesting and unique and deserves more play, but not something I am excited about.

RATING: 7.5
Not quite sure yet how much chaos rules this one, even with 3.  There are numerous paths to victory, but it is easily possible for your plans to be foiled by other players, or the die if playing 2 or 3.  The random factor of when tiles come out, combined with the the chaos added by your opponents might make it a little too tactical, but, on the other hand it plays fairly quickly so perhaps in balance it is good.  The only real problem is the tendency toward AP as players weigh the relative costs vs benefits of tiles and turn-order,

The length and calculations necessary to play well, make the game want for more control--gut feeling is that it might fall to a 6 or 7 in few more plays, but it might surprise me as we all get use to the tile sets....

*****

After more play we find that this game works great for two players--and the ghost player is an often nerve-wracking push-your-element, which truly adds to the game, rather than just "making it work."  Two or three players seems pretty optimal to us, as more players increases the player-driven chaos, and pushes the game progressively more towards tactical at the expense of the more decision-based strategy found at 2 and 3.

May 2012: Just played it again and it is growing on me.

At the moment, probably the most requested game in our group.  Its kind of hard to put a finger on as to why but it is a small game with a big bang.  Lots of ways to score and a pleasure to try and figure out.  I'm sure to be hanging on to this one!

Adding on to this comment:  I had to lower the score a bit for this one.  I have played maybe 6 times and am still not sure what to make of the game.  I just can't seem to figure out how to score in this game.  However, I am (surprisingly) not too frustrated about it.  I still have the feeling I can figure out some strategies and therefore still very willing to give this game quite a few more tries.

I really like the theme and the mechanics.  Hoping to my rating in the near future!

Satisfying & tricky blend of constrained tile-laying and resource management. Lots of little decisions required at various points, and plenty of variety in approaches to scoring. The 'differential scoring' seems unusual (compared to the more common majorities scoring) and means that players that seem to have locked-in VP can be reined in by the back marker.

I'd be delighted if I could master the knack of efficiently placing & activating complimentary groups of tiles - in fact I seem to be getting [i]less[/i] good at this with each play, which makes me more determined to master this art.

I absolutely adore this game. It's simple but thinky, and overall one of the best light to middleweight euros out there, in my opinion. My wife loves it - one of the few games she is excited about. I am a sucker for Tile-laying games, and this one is a fantastic step up from Carcassonne. Planning your little village around maximizing your tile activations is a fantastically fun little puzzle. The ONLY problem with this game is that you really need 4 or 5 people playing. With 2 or 3 there is this damned annoying little dice that you roll that simulates another player. I just don't like the randomness. With other players, you at leaast have a DECENT idea if a tile you want will be available by analyzing the other player's style of play, but that little dice is a jerk and always takes what you want...Ugh. But anyway, I only play this with 4 or 5, and thats where my rating comes from. Normally I'd dock a game for having a weaker player range, but this one is just too good to knock points off (and I know other people don't mind it as much as I do). "

Never did grab me. There's much to like here not least of which is a great theme and plenty of strategic scope, but the game falls into this mire of being too many things at once. A bit of market, a bit of drafting, a bit of tile placement, a bit of resource management and none of it feels fleshed out enough to give the game a real sense of purpose.

There's also something about 3 scoring rounds and VP chips instead of public track which I hate. See Airlines Europe and to a lesser extent Alhambra.

Never in the field of gaming have so many mechanisms been rolled into such a small package with such a low weight. Glen More is a deceptively low/mid complexity game boasting a whole of features: innovative turn-order mechanism, spatial tile laying, resource market and income/VP generating engine.

Only a few plays so far but this game rather has me hooked.

It's medium complexity and time investment of about an hour seem to scratch an itch for me rather well. 

Once I have a few more games played I'll enter a rating but i them an idea this will settle as an 8 to 8.5

Update August 2010

I've posted the 8 score, I'm not bored of it yet and it's becoming a firm favourite to play at home with she who must be obeyed as well as with the local group, it only drops the .5 from what I originally intended as Lucy will sometimes sit out from a game.

Cynthia and I have been playing it all week as a 2p. Even with the dummy 3rd player, it's very competitive.  In fact, because of the Tinner's Trail/Thebes-like turn mechanism, turns spun around even faster with 2. 

Starts off simple, but the last few rounds are pretty brain-burning as you're trying to juggling 6-9 potential actions at a time. I'd say that it's a perfect Entrée game before starting on a heavier game.

A nice, compact victory point engine game. Basically a game for 4, a "robot" player is added when playing with 3. The players leap-frog around a (topologically) circular track which is kept filled with various tiles which grant resources (men and material) and special powers. There are an initial set of tiles, 0 (zero), and then 1 to 3, which denote phases of the game. Victory points are awarded for completing certain actions, and for having more whiskey, parliament votes, and special tiles at the end of each phase.

Two interesting factors hold greed in check, If you really want a tile, you have to leap far ahead to make sure you get it, since your opponents can leap ahead, too. This means you aren't going to get your next turn for some time--until they've all passed you. On the other hand, at the very end of the game, you get assessed 3 points per tile, and it's difficult to get tiles to produce that many VPs in the game. Yet when it's your turn to leap frog, you either take the best tile available to you, or grab tiles you don't really need (costing -3 VP at the end of the game) trying to get the tile you really want.

I enjoy this game, but I truly suck at it. I think luck of the draw has a little to do with it, but taking a village as your first or second tile is a bad plan.

For a card-drafting, engine-building game, I like this one. The player interaction is low, but competing for tiles and income via the warehouse adds enough to keep things interesting. I also enjoy the rule that penalizes players for building a large village. While counter-intuitive at first, this penalty provides yet another inter-player vector to monitor (in addition to the chieftains, cards, and whiskey).

Ultimately, it's the fact that players must not only build a victory point engine, but also do so in step with the other players that makes this game a winner in a genre that I normally write off as nothing more than a multi-player solitaire exercise in optimization. Glen More does not save the genre for me, and it won't be my favorite game, but it does have its charms, and I can bring it out with players who don't share my passion for high interaction contests.

This is a great game.  It manages to include resource management, spatial relations, unique location tiles, a very interesting turn order mechanism, and a supply/demand economy, all while remaining fairly simple and quick to play.  Impressive.  I love how players can choose to take more but less impressive turns, or fewer turns, but jumping ahead to get just what they need.

Possibly my favorite euro system, with a lot of paths to victory and lots of engine building. The feeling of reward is frequent for all players in this game, which is great. The only negatives are that when using the dice with two three players, it can have a negative random detrimental effect on players unevenly. Also, since the same tiles are used every game, there isn't as much variety as in some euros.

I played a pre-production copy of this several times at the 2010 Gathering of Friends. I like the tile-drafting mechanism, but the rest of this game didn't set my imagination on fire.

This is a very solid, quick playing tile laying game. Really like the tiles in a rondel mechanic. Can be some pretty tough decisions on skipping ahead to get some of the bonus cards. Probably would be enhanced nicely if the cubes were replaced with wood tokens shaped like the things they represent. This will likely become a game that I play for a long time in the future.

Not a bad little game.  There were a couple of simple rules that took me awhile to get the hang of (tile placement is adjactent to a tile with a meeple but tile activation is based on adjacency to the just-placed tile).  The theme is super thin and really not at all connected to the mechanics.  But it's a game I'd like to play a few times to try different approaches.

Very nice tileplacement game with timeline turn taking. A mechanic that never seems to get old (I haven't encountered any game with this element I didn't enjoy.

A 9 rating after the first play of a new Euro?  How can this be?  

Let me tell you how--it is a terrific game.  That is how.  It is a 402 in a Plymouth Horizon.  Resource management, spatial reasoning, worker placement, all with a small bit of cutthroat play.  Wow.  

I didn't think that it was possible to find a Euro that I really enjoyed playing anymore.  I figured they had gone the way of the buffalo.  Guess what?  I just spotted one!

The game felt a little bit chaotic the first couple of times, but after playing some more I started to realize the amount of depth that this game can have. Very good game, and the two-player version is incredibly elegant in a similar way to Pergamon's two-player version: you just roll a die and remove a tile each turn.

Update: As much as I like the gameplay, the low-quality production values really made us not want to play the game very much. Would buy again if they ever release a deluxe version.

Outstanding tile-laying game that incorporates many familiar mechanics (rondel-like variable turn order, spatial decision-making, resource timing/management) into an easily digestible whole.  

The only knock I can give this game is that with low player counts (2 or 3), there is not really that much competition for resources and thus the market is seldom used.  I suspect the tension of acquiring the correct resources would ratchet up with 4 or 5 players.  

So long, Carcassonne!

This game feels a lot like Caylus, but without the flexibility on varying your strategy. The downtime in the game can be painful as people figure out the effects of that each tile would create.

Glen More was neat to play as we just returned from the Scottish Highlands.

The game itself has some fun, unique qualities. Movement is similar to Patchwork, but you can choose to claim any tile on the board. However, the further you move along the track the more opportunity opponents have to claim multiple (albeit less powerful) tiles.

This is offset a bit by the final scoring, where any player who has more tiles than the player with the least number of tiles is penalized significant points.

Hopefully this gets a reprint soon.

Fairly good tile placement/engine building game.

Multiple competitive goals, minimum luck and great variability create a strong combo. The market is well implemented.

The game does have some downtime, but not enough to spoil the fun. It does make the game drag a little longer than I would like though. I don't like the way the dice is used. The theme is also not that strong, not to mention not that interesting.

I was pleasantly surpised by this. Maybe my rating will rise as I play more.

This one didn't take me quite as much as I had anticipated it would. I have a nagging feeling this one will decrease in rating a tad after several plays. I love time mechanics like this but this game distorts it as is punishes you for utilizing it to take more actions. The rest of the game, collecting tiles and generating a point engine, is all kind of been there done that, before kind of thing. Good theme though and fun little game given it's short play time is a BIG plus for this game. For such a small short game it does deliver what larger games attempt to do.

Glen More is a game for gamers. It has some new mechanisms. The mechanism for selection of tiles is nice (not great because most of the time it feels like players are getting the tiles in turn order, but it improves as the game comes to its end (players leapfrog to get better tiles). The mechanism for the market is great (more games should adopt this). The mechanism for scoring is based on comparison of your progress vs the other players which very balancing and nice (I wish they had a scoring track around the board instead of victory little tiles). The mechanism of placing and activating tiles is brilliant and fresh. The problem with the game is that the tiles should have been made larger and with better standard illustrations of what they produce and how they function. Also more cubes are necessary (they should have added 3 extra cubes in each color). It is a tricky game that it would have been a great game if only the tiles had a better and more consistent description on them of how they work. As you can tell from my comments, a great game but whoever was head of the art department clearly downgraded the game.

RATING: 7
This is a tile laying game where you pick tiles from a circular track.  You don't get to play again until the other players catch up to you.  So you can jump ahead to grab something you really need, but you won't move again for a while.  Which might not be a bad idea in some cases as having more tiles in your tableau than other players counts against you at game end.  

There are three scoring rounds where you're judged on how much whiskey you have, how many chieftains, and how many special sites you've built.  The higher you are than the worst player the better, up to a point where it's capped.

When you lay a tile it activates and triggers all it's neighbors.  Tiles have some placement restrictions... tiles must match up to either your one river (north-south) or your one road (east-west) or a tile with neither.  Additionally you can only place a tile adjacent to a Chieftain which can make moving Chieftains an important decision.

There are a bunch of tiles, and you're going to have to keep checking what the special tiles do.  The tile iconography isn't sufficient for them.

Overall it's a clever little game with interesting decisions that plays fairly quickly.

RATING: 8
[thing=66362][/thing] is a strange game at first. The turn order caused some frowning in my friends, that struggled a little with it. Also, the notion that when you place your newly acquired place, all the location adjacent (even diagonally) are activated - this also caused confusion throughout the whole game, especially because of the diagonally thing and the need of a clan member near by. Some of the players got all this by the third turn, more or less, others were doing things wrong all the way to the end.

Also, the buying and selling of goods worked until a point: after all the stones and wood were bought, no one else wanted to sell them - the ones that have them, didn't wanted to "give" the chance for the others to purchase such goods, trying to hamper the tile-acquiring abilities of the other players. So the market was basically "locked" from early turns until the very end (when someone then sell goods to get the coins, to use them for VPs). Maybe this is usual, maybe I was playing with bastards :), by now I can't say.

Even with this perks, I liked [thing=66362][/thing] quite a bit, and basically all the other players in the table also. It is a smart game, that went on fast and gives a lot to think about (from the choice of a tile, to its placing, its uses, and its relation to what the others have). All of this in the 1 hour time.

I need to explore this game further, so its rating will probably change in the near future.

The rate did change: up! From 7.5 now to a solid 8.

My first actual time track game. I don't think it's very good, but +.5 for coming in a small box and not taking too long to play.

The point of the time track is supposed to be that you can sacrifice turns in order to leap ahead to grab something of high value. I see a couple of things that keep this from being interesting in Glen More. First, especially early in the game I don't feel like the values among various tiles vary that much. Secondly, you won't even be able to take a number of tiles because of placement restrictions. (This also limits the potential for hate drafting.)

The game penalizes players at game end who have taken more tiles than others. I guess this is supposed to give players a push in the direction of jumping further down the track, even if there is nothing so much more valuable there.

The chieftain placement system is a little displeasing. It governs where you can place new tiles and which tiles you will be able to use, but the decisions don't seem difficult.

I like the supply/demand-based market system for the various goods, but I didn't usually feel I had enough control to make it part of a strategy. The game's shortness doesn't help here.

The short and chaotic feel also makes the game feel more like solitaire.

While the activations reminded me of Cuba and the "last goes first" nature reminded me of Shipyard, I didn't enjoy this game nearly as much as the others.

So in other words, a middle-of-the-road Euro.

Present from vitamientje who made me a surprise this summer! The mechanics is clever, and it gives a lot of satisfaction for its short length. It's interesting and allows for different ways to gain victory points without becoming heavy. A lot of great wooden bits, nice art and works very well with two players. The only glitch is that the board, tiles and token should be thicker. But we like this game a lot and I expect we will play it many more times!

Solid game that does, however, offer little new. Choose tiles to produce cubes, use cubes to gain VP, add some rondel (timing) decisions and a Knizia like scoring mechanism. I like it as a gamer's game that is mostly tactical by nature (Agricola for example encourages you to think ahead more), that is not necessarily suitable for non-gamers. Components are OK-ish (nice artwork, but everything is really small). Plays well with two. Nuff said.

After one play through, I like the game so far.  It's compact, provides lots of interesting choices, many ways to win, and looks good.  It may be too fiddly to use with those new to euros.  Need another play to be sure.  Wondering if all versions are in German, or if Leons was an early release.

[i]"Very good. Like to play, will probably suggest it, will never turn it down."[/i]

Quick to teach and play for its depth, quite non-linear in its mechanisms and scoring. Very interesting game.

Not great with 2 due to comparative scoring, good with 3 + dummy dice, great with 4.

Excellent tile laying game, with some very interesting decisions to be made in a very short time. Thebes-like turn order system makes it difficult to decide which tile to take, as when you jump out too far, your opponents get easy access to the ones you jumped over. Very nice limited market, as goods may or may not be available to be bought or sold depending on how many times they've been done previously. All around great game.

(Jan 2011 - after 2 plays - 1 with 3p, 1 w/5p)  Took a game for me to "get it" and see the interaction of the parts.  Lots of familiar mechanics, but a lot going on in this small box.  The "activate" feature of tile laying is frustrating, the 3 "difference" scoring areas require specialization and balance.   Look forward to more plays.

Two fast tile-laying games behind and it feels good. The theme is quite pasted up, but comes up nicely on some points. It might take a game or two more to understand the combos and special tiles better, but it is still enjoyable. Not for casual gamers, perhaps. The "die player" is a nice addition to the smaller groups and it gives a nice random element.

Great tile placement game. The central tile selection mechanic cleverly intertwines turn order and tile desirability where leaping to a newer tile sets you further back in the turn queue. Add interesting placement/activation choices and you've got more fun than you'd think could fit in that small box.

RATING: 5
The standout mechanic of Glen More is the tile drafting mechanism, which implements the time concept from games like Neuland, Thebes and Tinner's Trail. There is also a mild spatial element to deal with as you place your acquired tiles in your personal tableau, not entirely unlike Alhambra or Vikings. 

In our recent four player game I was largely absent minded while my opponents debated where to place their tiles. I don't think the issue is so much that there's a long time between turns so much as there's so little to think about. I felt like once I committed to a strategy early on the choice of which tile to take was mostly obvious once it came around to my turn. I dislike when in games I decide what I'm going to do and then spend all this time executing the decision I already made. This is why the game Lost Valley doesn't work for me: you have to walk to point A to get a resource and then come back to your base and then walk to point B and then come back to your base and then go... all to just do a simple conversion that you decided on 20 minutes ago. Glen More isn't quite as onerous but in a real sense it's like the whole game is one protracted execution of a decision you made early on without anything of interest along the way.

1e essai à 4 joueurs. À première vue, il avait piqué ma curiosité parce qu’il m'avait rappelé Carcassonne (pose de tuiles) tout en possédant des mécaniques assez différentes pour soulever mon intérêt lors de la lecture des règles. Ce fût donc une déception pour moi lorsque notre partie-découverte s'est révélée plutôt lourde (ennui généralisé). Entre autres, je n’ai pas apprécié les règles du chemin et de la rivière uniques qui m’ont semblé plus irritantes que pertinentes. Cependant, d'autres mécaniques du jeu m'ont semblé intéressantes, tel le circuit des tuiles et le marché, mais pas assez pour contrebalancer mon ressenti global négatif.

There's absolutely nothing wrong with this game.  It works, it presents a nice set of challenges to the players, and there's a nice balance of offensive and defensive play that occurs simultaneously, giving the game a bit of tension.  Unfortunately, there's nothing really great about this game, either.  It's just another Euro with nothing special about it, which then becomes largely forgettable.

This is the game that put Matthias Cramer on the map and for good reason. Mixing a Carcassonne style tile laying game with a fairly complex resource management game, Glen More hits all the notes that pure Euro fans love. The real trick however, is that Cramer manages to strip out every speck of unnecessary fat. This game can be taught in 10 minutes, but feels much more complex, as building your tableau of tiles for peak efficiency is a real brain burn.

It's crazy to me that this has stayed out of print for so long.

2.6 - Played a bunch on Yucata before buying. Very good game. Fast, thinky, tactical. Love the rondel-style turn order/tile acquisition track, intermediate scoring and simple yet deep tile interactions. The ONLY thing that could improve this game is better, maybe larger components. I might just trick this game out - it's that good!

RATING: 8
Really clever game with a cute theme. I really like how the turn order mechanism is complicated by the need to be efficient in your tile purchases. If your opponents are investing time in actions that are valuable to them, you must also be selective in your choices since just cleaning up all the skipped over tiles will drag you down. Prevents spammy strategies and forces tough decisions in what would otherwise be obvious situations.

Glen More is a light-medium resource-conversion game similar to Troyes, but not as prone to AP so it moves faster.  The conversion process -- resources->goods->VPs -- is far less complex than Troyes, and as such I enjoy it more as this is not my preferred type of game.  No confrontation other than taking a tile someone else may want, a la Vikings.  Worth replaying.

Have not played this game yet, but my initial impression is that the component boards and tiles are a bit flimsy.  I would have liked Carcassonne thickness tiles, but then again, I wouldn't have paid $22 new for it either!

Update -- played this last weekend at MidSouthCon in Memphis as a 2P and liked it a lot.  Got beat up by allowing my opponent to get both butchers and a pair of cattle producing tiles, but had a blast.  Like the length and the multiple paths to victory.

I initially passed over this game because the title and box cover art was so boring. That was a mistake. I've never seen a turn order action mechanic like this. So cool.

Only one play in.  It didn't "grab" me, but I think with more plays and a better understanding of what the different tiles/cards do, the rating will go up.

It's got the feel of most resource mgmt titles without the ungainly stash of card and wood. There are three reasons why this is enjoyable: 

1: The flexible queue-like turn order system which allows bonkers leaps ahead to pick exactly what you want at the cost of waiting out a few turns, or a slow creep around the tile board soaking up everything in sight while everyone has to wait for you to catch up.

2: The satisfying triggering of neighbouring tiles when placing a new tile. 

3: The seperate puzzle of clansmen movement which governs your web-like sprawl across the table

Very nice tile laying game. The order of picking tiles is decided by who is in the back so you can get several extra turns by choosing tiles near the back. That can be a negative though because the larger cities (most tiles) receive negative points. The activation of tiles is new as well. I like this one.

Increased my rating of Glen More now that I've (finally) played it with two. Thought it would never see the table again due to competition at four-five players. The dummy (dice) 'player' works fine in this game; you almost don't notice its presence.

Glen More is a very abstract game of getting stuff to buy more stuff to gain victory points, but it has a neat turn order mechanic where you can decide to jump ahead to gain a tile you really want but then have to wait until the pack catches up to you before you can go again.

Good game, a bit economic for me but unique enough to keep playing.

Nice little pure-Euro game. The tile selection and activation mechanics are very elegant. My main complaint is that the scoring rounds feel like they should be the focus of the game, and yet they're mostly overshadowed by the points scored through taverns and selling resources. It's hard to get far enough ahead in any one thing to get the larger bonuses, and even harder to get their early enough to score them more than once.

Really fun fairly lite Euro. Even though it says 2 players I have become a bit disenchanted with it as a 2 player game. Works as that but much MUCH better with 3 or more. Good mix of tile/worker placement with interesting turn order mechanic to keep it interesting. Several paths to victory. Whole thing seems tight as the game can move more quickly then you think it will so you need to really think choices through from the get go - no real room to correct if you get in trouble - so plays better with experienced players familiar with the tiles/powers.

interesting variant tile laying game with tile selection reminiscent of Around the World, or Thebes.  The manipulation of workers allows placement of tiles in various zones, and as a consequence allows actions of the tiles to activate.  a cool system.  the final scoring bit where you lose points for having more tiles is pure euro bullshit.  i would never play the game again with that rule.  why punish players for doing well at the game??

Great tile-laying game and certainly one of my favorites.  New players can get bogged down a bit with tile-placement, however, which tends to drag the game.  It's definitely also the kind of game you'll need to play once or twice, to get your head around scoring.

This is a board game best played slowly. Take the time to observe the position of available tiles and what your opponents are doing. The core mechanic and scoring system is relatively simple, yet it manages to create gameplay requiring a balance of efficiency vs greed and generalist vs specialist style of play. Short playtime is also another plus point.

The only drawback is the theme is rather pasted on. Nonetheless, the strong mechanic and scoring system more than makes up for that.

Leading your Highland clan to prosperity in Scotland is my kind of theme. Usually plays in less than an hour, but you experience something similar to what more heavier titles offer.

First: I love Scotland, so I had to buy the game.

The game is okay. I like the tile-grabbing part and the mechanic that always the last in line can make his/her turn, because it makes for some interesting decision-making: do I jump over all the tiles to the end, because I really want the tile that just came out or do I risk not getting it, but I can make some more moves in between?
Not my favourite game, but the gameplay is good and I'd play it again.

O my god, what is the text on the tiles small. So, now I have complained about it, and that’s it. I mean, I can keep talking about it, but you have to deal with it while you’re playing.

While playing, you’ll notice that this is a easy flowing game. The way the turn-order is determined is different then usual, and it makes it possible that if your opponent makes a big move forwards, that you might be able to take several turns after each-other. But you’ll have to keep in mind that for every tile that you own more then your opponents at the end of the game, will cost you three points. A way to avoid that loss, is to make sure every tile you take will give you three points minimum. The game mechanics are not very original. The way the turn-order is determined, we’ve seen before (for example in Neuland). But in this game, it just flows very well. Very pleasant to play. Not a game for families.

Combines Irondale, Alhambra, and Shipyard features.

Move around a Shipyard-style tile circle to pick up tiles.  Play them to your realm Alhambra-style.  Trigger played and adjacent tiles, Irondale-style, to get and use resources.  

I liked the movement mechanic a lot: you can jump ahead on the circle to acquire an especially tasty tile, but since the player at the back always gets the next turn, it might be a while before you get to go again.

Scoring is triggered three times as tile stacks are diminished.

This is a nice game, implementing a time track/loop with an insidious counterbalance:  It can be quite damaging to maximize the number of turns you get, if your yields are inefficient.  Very cleverly designed.  I quite like it!

Lighter than I expected. I've never been much good at tile placing.

Quite a lot of game into such a small box. This game somehow encourages you to think through and weight your every move, as impact on scoring is public and involves every player, resulting in long and boring games with AP players. That's the wrong way of playing it though, as after few plays it's evident that the tile draw scrambles most deterministic evaluations.
Played smoothly and without weighting too much every action this is an extremely enjoyable and deep enough experience that blends together many mechanics in a clever way. Probably works best with 3-4 players.

After 2+ Plays: I like all the parts of this game, but it is lacking some spark that would make it really good.  As it stands this will probably enter the large mass of pretty good games that I'll never suggest but will be happy to play.

Wow if only every game can be like this one. Simple, clever, replayable, deep and fast all at once!

Great game for sure. Although it's actually quite fiddly and quite a bit to teach for a small box. Meeple budget is also clearly a bit lean.

This is a solid game but feels simply a bit dry and solitaire'ish.

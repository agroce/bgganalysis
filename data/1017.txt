120909 Interesting abstract early game by Friedman Friesse.  The components could use and upgrade and the game is opaque as hell...but then again so is Alien City on a first play.  If it wasn't for the combo of opacity and components I'd play it again, but right now I'd prefer to play Alien City.

Great game, horrible rules (as always with 2F).  Will make your head hurt more than T&E.  Only flaw I can see is that it is almost NEVER worth actually bidding for a tile.

Love it. very hard. Needs better tiles. With too many players there usually are tons of externalities due to other players poor moves. But that's life. Tons of people all around the world find themselves in the middle of wars because of no fault of their own. Back to the game, I find it very challenging to figure out good moves because it is hard to visualize more than a couple of changes on the board. Very unique design. I have never seen anything like this.

Tough to play. Too easy to overlook streets you should have placed and other details, requiring backpedaling. At the end of the day it's hard thinking that's kind of fun, but too much luck to make the work worthwhile. Neat ideas in here, but somehow needed more dumbing down.

A decent quick little tactical game (note that randomness can play a large role if you happen to hate this).  It's quick enough for a filler, but the setup is a bit annoying (assuming you don't remember how many of each tile to use for a given number of players).

RATING: 7
Excellent emergent effect, good lookahead, and quite fun.

The only downside, but a significant downside, is intrinsic to the design, so is not fixable in a board game instantiation: the road fill-in is extremely sensitive to human error.  That is enough to dock it from what might have been almost a 9.

Tricky sometimes to understand what should be appropriated and what not.  High screwage factor!

RATING: 7.5
Absorbing early FF game.  The road building element is a puzzle on its own.  Its easy to get stitched up in this game.  But its reasonably short for this not to matter too much. Not everyone's cup of tea, but if you enjoy puzzles, you're likely to enjoy this.

Played just 5 players games. I like it. Very clever, the more I play the deeper it seems. It's extremely important to not overcommit in tile auction, for often the money left will decide who will win.

This is a brain-burner when trying to figure out how to place the roads. When I read the rules, I figured it would be easy to do it, but in practice it wasn't.  After a second playing, I think the hype that the expropriation is *really difficult* influenced my initial reaction.  It isn't as difficult as suggested by some, though I can see errors being made in future games, though not enough to ruin the game.

I think this is one of those examples of "games I like because I'm pretty good at them".  There are also games I dislike because I'm horrible at them (I'm looking at you, Kahuna).

The game is interesting, and it's fun to puzzle over.  My positive rating is in spite of the jarring auction that occasionally comes up.  I don't like it when designers tack on an auction to balance something that is inherently unbalanced.  It works fine in this game, however.

RATING: 7
This is quite a brain burner for a simple looking game. You start with a 10x10 grid and add 4 factory tiles. The deal is that roads get built to connect the factory tiles with 1 outlet for each factory, per player that they can place once they have "reserved" a sqare with a cube. The kicker is that the roads get built when there's no other way out of a factory, so other tiles must be on the other 3 sides, either blocker tiles or outlet tiles. So you have to picture the completed board and then work back to place what you want, where you want it. The idea is to have your outlet tils closest by road to the factories. There's bedding too, to make it more fun. Oh, and some additional random tiles you can add.

RATING: 7
A fun but rather bizzare game. You build buildings and then roads by implication; this can be hard to see and the rules on this are not crystal-clear. Don't screw it up; if you miss a road placement, it can have a bad effect on the game. Still, a very interesting game and entirely unique. However, don't be too put out by its general lack of availability - it's certainly not a "top 10" type, good for a number of plays but a little too bizzare to be truly replayable.

I should say too the difficulty of seeing roads makes this game almost impossible to play competitively. You'll realize halfway through that a spot where you've built something actually had to be road and you need to retroactively bulldoze it or the game falls apart. It's almost inevitable this will happen; nobody is ever likely to play this game frequently enough to become facile with the road-visualization thing. So when it happens you just have to grin and bear it. A corrollary to this: don't play with anyone who is so intense a gamer that they would willfully not point out a spot they know has to be a road for personal gain.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Ugh.  The rules for road building are horrendous, as it leaves it up to the players to "figure out" when roads should be built.  Other than that, the auctions are often lackluster, as everyone bids zero in the early-goings for fear of being screwed by the other players if they place their shops too early.  I'll probably never willingly play this again.

RATING: 8
Regarding the Plenary edition: Overall, great work -- it looks terrific, and is a lot of fun!  A couple of bits comments: the cubes are awfully small, and the tiles aren't perforated very well, so they don't come out smoothly.  Also, the green cubes are hard to see on the green board.  But don't let that stop you from buying it.

I've been playing it 2-player with my son lately, and I'm surprised at how quickly it plays that way.  We can finish a game in about 15 minutes.

Great game with some mind bending rules. I'm glad I searched out a used copy.

This really is a game about increasing probabilities.  There are many times when I get the exact piece I though I wanted, only to find the limitations of tile placement has worked to screw me over.  We've houseruled where initial legal placement of markers are to make the game almost diabolical.  Otherwise, the two player option contains little tension in the tile draw.

Wow, this great game doesn't get the run it deserves on the Geek.  I have the Plenary Games version, which (in my opinion) has inferior components to most of the Rio Grande/bigger company stuff you might get.  But they are certainly adequate.  Unfortunately, two of my players blocks looked extremely close to the same color...so I just painted one a different color.

But the game itself more than makes up for any minor quibbles (and that's all they are) I have about components. I love the way the auctions work.  I love the way the positioning gets to be very convoluted and tense.  I love how you can totally screw your opponent with a clever play.  One downside is that at least one player really needs to have a good eye for when roads need to be placed.  Its unfortunate to discover a tile that ought to have been changed AFTER someone has already made a move (or multiple have) based on the board configuration as it stood.  Its a little tricky to get that bit of the rules sorted in one's mind (or it was for me), but once that's mastered the game totally rocks.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Minimalist and quick for a brain burner, yet engaging given its niche. Choosing which plots to reserve can be tricky, and being able to see which sites the government is going to expropriate definitely takes some getting used to, and will make or break ones ability to play this game well, or even enjoy it. Reserving the right lots can be tricky, and there are a lot of opportunities to screw the opposition once you start to understand how the expropriation works. There are enough variables in play to keep you thinking, but not such a broad decision tree that AP sets in. Absolutely a gamers only title.

I owned this for quite a while, but I ultimately got rid of my copy because it just was a pain to get onto the table, and because I kept mentally having problems explaining and enforcing the expropriation rule correctly...every time I pulled it out we would play it one way for half the game, and then mentally realize that there were situations where that interpretation of expropriation wouldn't work correctly, and then we'd have to muddle to another solution, and so on. I like the idea of the game, but I think it needs a slightly cleaner implementation.

RATING: 5
Completely nuts.  It's nice to see this sort of "gonzo" game design that's totally original.  Of course, that comes with a caveat- the rules are sort of confusing at first but once you get it, it's one of those "ohhh...I see now" things.  I can't see ever playing it again, but at least it was an interesting desing for its time.

Everyone was right about the difficulty of not screwing the game up by missing required expropriations. But it's good if you get it right. 1 point off for below average cardboard bits, and red/orange player cubes that are virtually IDENTICAL, which means in reality this is not a five player game unless you expropriate (pun intended) small cubes from like Wallenstein or something.

Darryl's game finally made it to the table.  I enjoyed it, but like Pat noted, I too am unsure I can spot when the roads must get laid.  Would like to play again, so that is a good sign.

Clever, elegant tile placement game.  The board begins empty, apart from four suppliers (of fish, games, nuclear waste and petrol).  The players must position their four retail outlets as close as possible in terms of street spaces to the suppliers.  The game is unique in that streets are placed *after* the buildings, and the concept is a tricky one that takes a couple of games to grasp.  Unique.

Make sure you're playing by the correct expropriation rules.  And then make doubly sure you're expropriating as soon as necessary!  Despite the difficulty in just getting the rules right, I find it a great brain-burning game.  I'm beginning to suspect that with 5 players it's too chaotic, though, because you can get screwed by the wrong sequence of tile draws between your turns without anything you can do about it.

It has a reputation as a brain burner, but it doesn't have to be.   Feels like an older, simpler German game... because it is.   You are simply trying to connect four of your shops to 4 common supply centers for those shops.   Because of the uncertainty of the tile draw, and the blind bidding, you don't have to worry a lot about control, because there isn't too much.   The forced road building is the brain-burny part of the game.   If somebody else knows how that works, then you can play casually and still enjoy it.    I'm not sure if I like that aspect of the game, but that's also it's most unique characteristic.

In addition to all the tile-laying goodness, this game also provides some great opportunities for fun screwage.  However, I must say, that even though I get them (finally... I think), the quirky appropriation rules left a bad taste with my group, and create a significant barrier to entry for new players.  Yes, they're extremely simple once you get them, but everyone seems to struggle with them at first.  Providing an overly profuse collection of examples in the rules would've helped a lot.

I have the new edition from Plenary. A very good mix of auction and placement, but it takes a while to figure when to place roads. The new edition is nicely made, but the proofreading on the rules could be better. There's an errata, but these are for typos that should have been spotted. Angela's picked a real classic to start with, I'm sure she's learnt tons in making this and will get better and better.

Awesome.  Very thinky.  Took 3-4 plays to understand the strategy.  The rules are simple but the implications are quite broad.  Early on I had quite a bit of success introducing this to people, more than I thought I would.  My last game didn't go over to well, but I think it had more to do with the gap between my understanding the game and doing well and the other 3 players not grasping it until it was too late.  Doesn't have to take very long to play, which is a good thing.  I've had great experiences with 2, 3 and 4 so far.  The hard part is planning the best spots to reserve your plots.  This is one of the few games I can actually say that I "always want to play."  May even beat AoS because it's shorter and scales down better.  Quite possibly my favorite Euro of all time.  Rating upped from 9 to 10.

Played 1 time. I have no idea if my rating will rise from a 5 or not. Part of the problem with this game is that the visuals are quite poor. It is easy to lose the &#039;retail&#039; tiles on the board or not match them up easy with their suppliers because the colors are a mishmash. Also, the cubes to mark property are way too small, and red and orange are almost identical. Also, the buildings are rather crudely put together and so big on the tiles that it makes the board far too &#039;busy&#039; visually. On top of that this game is hard to pick up on one game, which is another reason this starts out a 5. I know I would have liked it a lot better if we had randomized the Supplier placements, but the other players insisted on &#039;4 corners&#039; for beginners which made the game WAY too predictable (much in the way La Citta setup for beginners is so balanced it&#039;s boring.

Found this game in a thrift store for $2 some time ago, and am quite delighted with it.

The name is misleading. I was surprised to discover this was about creating the shortest distribution route for four products: games, gas, nuclear waste, and yes, fish. Couldn't they think of a better title?

Although the board expands for the number of players, the more players there are, the more interactive the game, and the less control over your routes. I found the 4-player game more fun than the 3-player--it was easier to gang up & totally squash the leader--serves them right for getting in the lead. And then I had to laugh when that person dinged my winning, 3-point path unexpectedly, and turned into a losing, maxed out 12 pt. one.  Lots of strategy in the placement & bidding.

Sorting in the beginning is tedious--bagging the street tiles separately helps. Lots of rule's translation problems & just some plain sloppiness--must get rules corrections from BGG, otherwise difficult to play the game correctly. Player's cubes incredibly tiny & easy to lose and handle--could have easily been 8 times larger. The gold player cubes are the same red's player cube, but just sprayed over gold--but the gold is rubbing off, so it is becoming difficult to tell which are red's cubes & which are gold's. I am probably going to have to replace the cubes, or at least re-spray the gold. Ignoring these side issues, I found the play refreshing and hope to snag some more people into playing.

Edit:  ended up replacing the cubes with larger, better painted ones.

Really not convinced after one play. (Update) Played again with two players and a better understanding of the rules. This game works quite well, provided everybody around the table does the effort of understanding the subtle automatic road construction mechanism. It is random but short, so it's not really an issue.

RATING: 7
Fresh Fish takes a little time to wrap your head around. The game is pretty short and the rules are quite simple, but the effects of those rules aren't exactly obvious which often leads to the city inadvertently paving over your plots in the first game. Of course, that doesn't really change later on, except now the city paves over your plots through the deliberate actions of your fellow players.

A wonderful mixture of tile placement and auctions. It does have a few issues presentation-wise but that is easy to condone in this case.

I would never have believed you could make a good game around the concept of eminent domain but this game succeeds. There are four commodities in the game. The closer you place your shop to the source of a commodity the higher you score. But no space can be left without road access so your carefully chosen location for future construction may be seized by the state to build a road to access one of your opponents buildings. 

This leads to interesting tactics like building non-scoring structures in locations to force the road away from a high scoring position for an opponent or to actually cause that position to be paved over. Lots of screw the opponent fun ensues.

Tough tile placement with blind bidding.  After much puzzling and error, I understand the road-building rules AND the restrictions on where cubes can be placed.  Now I need to learn how to ensure good locations for my shops.  :) A worthy challenge.

Not a bad game, but it is a little dull.  Tracking the road is kind of a pain, especially if it isn't placed when it should be.  The game is pretty darn dry and while there is strategy, you really are at the whim of draws.  I have nothing really against this, but I see this game getting old quickly.

RATING: 8.5
An astonishingly original design and a real mindbender, requiring non-obvious strategies and great attention to detail.  If my description makes Fresh Fish sound like a ponderous, glacial game, there's no need to worry.  It actually moves along at a nice clip, packing an expansive array of decisions and drama into about an hour's time. I like it best with four players, but will also happily play it with three or five. Five can feel rather chaotic, though.

Be sure to get a translation of the original 2F rules.  They're not perfectly clear, but they're much better than the mess of errors, misinterpretations and inexplicable changes that's included in the Plenary Games box. In the original rules the auctioneer wins all tiebreakers, and claims are allowed only adjacent to undeveloped claim markers or adjacent to roads (not next to developed tiles, as the PG edition states).  Also, expropriation is much, much simpler than the PG rules make it sound (2F rules are wordier than necessary here, too).

While the graphic style has some "still prototype" charme, the game is demanding and may even turn out to be mean.

RATING: 5
After one play (possibly with a bad tile mix), it seems almost inevitable that someone will spot a road placement several turns too late--and this always has a significant impact on the plays made before the error was spotted. This bodes ill for a competitive game. 
As a nifty quasi-puzzle, though, it is still a fair bit of fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a combination puzzle/game.  The goal is to lay the puzzle pieces that can go in multiple spots in such a way that when the rest of the puzzle gets finished, it benefits you more than the other players.  I really stink at it.  It seems pretty unpredictable with five people, not that I mind unpredictability, but for a game that is this much work, I would like to have felt like my choices influenced the outcome in a way that wasn't total luck.  The puzzle aspect turned me off, the components are ugly, the theme didn't really make sense.  Fearsome Floors is a similar game with a better theme, better components, and a lot more fun!

RATING: 4
I've only played this once, and am torn between wanting to play it more and hating it because of the appropriation rule.  That rule is clunky to describe -- we had a big argument about it the first time we played it!  Basically, all unbuilt squares and road squares must be connected to each other at all times.  This leads to sudden and unexpected conversions of claimed (but unbuilt) squares into road tiles at times, and requires all players to reason out what squares should be paved over after every move.  Would be better with computerization ("if I did this, what squares would be appropriated as road tiles?").

A highly original route finding tile layer that succeeds in spite of modest production values. Make sure you thoroughly understand the expropriation rules before you start (how well you understand them will be a major determinant of how much you like the game) and preferably have a second player with similar insight as mistakes are possible and will wreck the gameplay. Plenty of deep thought and clear sightedness is required to come out the winner. The industry would do well to produce more games that display this much originality rather than simply turning out games that use the mechanism of the moment.

Mar09: Soooo.... my wife really hated this one.  It took her half a game to understand the rules.  I completely understand why too.

Do I think I'll play it more?  Well I'd just like to anyway.  I'd sure like to.  My preferred rules:

Can Reserve Adjacent to Anything (Just not nothing.)
Tile Drawer wins Ties
If a Space can't Currently be a Building it is Permanently A Street
Money is Just a Tiebreak
Game ends when building deck is exhausted, all other spaces become streets.

RATING: 6.5
Ideal Players: 4-5

Description: Players try to position their markets as close as possible to the relevant goods. A single road must connect to every tile placed, forcing players to think about the board in terms of right-of-way.

Pro: Requires a very unique style of thinking, making it a fresh change from other games. Bidding sets tile prices at market value.

Con: Some people have a hard time with the concept of right-of-way and the unique style of thinking required to play.

Not my kind of game, I think.  I have yet to encounter an FF game that I really like.  This game is VERY spatial, so if you're like me, and have a hard time wrapping your head around spatial games, then you may struggle with this one, as I did.  It's hard for me to foresee where road tiles are going to go, depending on where people play, so it was frustrating.  But I'd play again to see if it gets any easier for me to get it.

A bit surprised by the high rating.  The game struck me as kind of OK but not something I would be clamouring to play again quickly.  The bidding mechanism seemed kind of pasted on and fairly irrelevant (most of the time it seemed better to wait to see where the road was going and so not bidding anything, this being especially true if you deduct money spent from your score).  The roadbuilding was not too difficult to work out but still took some effort and didn&#039;t add to the enjoyment level.  An OK game which I&#039;ll give another try.

I have never played anything quite like Fresh Fish. Spatially dynamic, Fresh Fish begins with only one tile on the board with the rest randomly drawn and bid upon, leaving the rest of the board to develop at the will of the players.

Be forewarned, the rules are poorly written and easily misunderstood. We didn't play a mistake free game until our fourth session and that was after three previous sessions that same evening.

Fresh Fish could be a simple tile laying game with few rules if it weren't for the two requirements that all buildings need a road access and all road tiles must be connected.
The challenge is in understanding the implications of these two rules when erecting buildings and appropriately preparing these builds by claiming the necessary spots before. After two games, I barely can foresee the resulting automatic laying of road tiles and often I only see what I should have done after things happen.
Fresh Fish is a subtle and abstract game that will please fans of games like Dolmengötter, King of Siam, Winsome train games and the like.
It's major weakness is the rudimentary scoring system. With the standard rule of money counting for scoring purposes, the strategy of mostly not bidding for tiles and saving money is too strong compared to board play. The proposed variant of money counting only as tie breaker almost entirely eliminates the challenge of managing the money supply.

A few plays in now and I really like this game. The gameplay is very chaotic in a way (tile draws can drastically change the lay of the board) but there is still strategic and tactical planning.

The road expropriations really have to be examined after each action carefully to ensure none are missed or the game can quickly become an error fest. Having said that when done properly the game is very entertaining and plays quickly.

Probably the brain-burner with the simplest rules ever -- but it can be so hard to figure out the roads, I can see many games completed with 'wrong' road placements. Not a huge fan of the blind bidding (the game would work better with straight-up bidding, I think), and possibly too chaotic with 4-5 players.

A placement and auction game where you're reserving land and building retail outlets that you buy in auctions on those spots.  Streets are built automatically based on an AI that will (eventually) connect to all of the outlets.  You want your outlets to connect (via street) to their corresponding supply centers in the shortest distance possible.  Easier said than done as your opponents can work to invalidate your reserve spots or to route the roads away from your supply centers.

A fascinating game with simple mechanics but with  difficult-to-understand placement and street-building rules.  The difficulty could be overcome quickly if someone could just print out a rule set with thorough, well-written examples.

I give Friese a ton of credit for such a cool design but wonder if some of the strategic depth that came from it did not happen by accident.  At times it can be mind-boggling as their are often hard-to-see domino effects after something's been built.

Lovely game, very cerebral. Hard to play correctly, the road rules are just so confusing. Gives a headache, but a good one. Has unfortunate usability issues, too, but they are quite minor.

This game doesn't work with two players. The bigger problem is that the game, overall, works with relatively few players. I've had massive problems finding suitable players for the game. Too bad, I like it, but I suppose it'll hit the trade pile, it's just too hard to get on table (once, maybe, but nobody wants to play it again).

Suggest.

Blech.  The fish are rotten in this game, which I just didn't enjoy at all.  Here's the problem:  after each move, the board must be carefully evaluated to see which spaces are unplayable, something that I don't think is intuitive at all.  If you miss one (which you will) and find out later it's unplayable, a player's action tokens on those spaces are thrown off the board.  So after each move, everybody has to sit and stare, and I mean really stare, at the board for a while to make sure they're not about to waste a move.  I don't necessarily mind sitting and staring at a board for a while, but not when the components are boring enough to put me to sleep and I don't really enjoy the game in the first place.  Move along.

Excellent game with my favorite theme (fish!). I totally love this one and play it 12 times in 2 weeks (which including 5 times in 3 days in a row).  Road expropriation rule is very neat and, fortunately, we don't have too much trouble with identifying them. Tried variant using road constraction tiles and demo tiles and I don't know if they are good addition or not.
I would like to try the variant that the money is worthless at the end of the game.

A game I found disconcerting. Lots of thinking trying to work out how to ensure the roads ran straight from the factory to my store, and then each game seemed to come down to the luck of the last few tiles to force the road either the short way or the long way around, regardless of how much thought went into the early stages. But it'll get replay because the initial challenge remains.

An excellent cerebral game that requires a little around-the-corner thinking.  The board builds dynamically and your moves indirectly build the roads.  I've never played any game like it and I'll keep it in my collection for that reason alone even if I didn't like it.. Which I do!

1st play with 4: it was spatially difficult to grasp how the roads are played out and so preventing the tactical play of influencing where the road should go. Then you have the hard task of evaluating current and potential score status of players, although at least it is spatially intuitive. Not sure if all that mental effort is worth it when you have to then draw a random tile (where as in El Caballero you had a choice). Theme fits well with game play.

I've only just played Fresh Fish for the first time, and it was very much a learning game punctuated by rules errors, but I was highly intrigued by the strong spatial element. The 'expropriation' rule (in this original edition, not the recent reprint) is simply stated but very hard to visualise - if one can get past that barrier, it seems to offer huge potential for dickishness. Reminded me slightly of the difficultly of route-wrangling in the wonderful Stephenson's Rocket.

Good game.  Really fun to play once you get your head around how the road is built.  There is a lot of fun in solving the puzzle aspect of where to build.

Rating dropped.  The last time I played, I had done all I could do 5 to 10 minutes before the game ended (and I won).  So basically I sat around watching people fight it out for no reason.  This game is great for the first 20 minutes, but then dries up for me.

I played it with 3 then with 5 players.  Great game with lots of tactical possibilities, great player interaction, great complexity, and about the right amount of randomness.  Rating might go up with more plays.  I think 5 players has a much different feel than with 3, since players have to be more aggressive in getting the choice locations.

A novel game that is both very simple and complicated at the same time.  This game has some interesting potential, especially with a higher player count.  The game is a bit dry and calculating combined with some luck of tile draws, and figuring out the roads can bog the game down a bit, but it has some good tension and nice twists.  It's good, but not as much fun as I'd hoped.

This is a great game.  The rules, once "grokked" are very simple and the game plays in less than an hour.  However there is considerable depth here, mainly in trying to force the road in the direction you want, which feels a bit like trying to steer a car in reverse.  This is leavened with a little luck in the tile draw so that the whole has a feel that is challenging but not painfully grindy.  The rules and the components leave a bit to be desired.

RATING: 6
The idea for this game is great, but it's just not something that I'm excited to play.  I'll definitely play it again at some point, but the core mechanism (when roads appear) needs to be truly understood to do well.  I think it would take me several games to really grasp that and I'm not sure I'll play it enough to get there.  Unique game that I'll play again, but not clamor to get to the table.

How can such a simple game be so difficult to figure out.  Trying to understand how the AI of the game is tough enough, but it doesn't help that the rulebook is a nightmare.

With that in mind it is a great game.  Many tough choices, lots of fun decisions, this is really what Carcassonne should have been.

It didn't seem quite the brainburner that it is reputed to be, but keeping track of the AI can be a pain.

I want to play this again immediately.

UPDATE:I didn't play this for years, but it was nice coming back to it.  It wasn't as great as I remember, but still it is a solid game.  This really needs an completely rewritten rulebook.  

I also feel that this game really is best with three, any more and the chaos is too much.

RATING: 8
Played twice.  This is a tough game of maximizing the efficiency of your fish distributing empire.  Instead of building routes to a pre-planned map, you place buildings on the map, and the routes are built by a simple set of deterministic rules.  These simple rules are rather confusing to implement, however, leading to arguments about where the road should actually be built.  Nevertheless, this is fun to play, and brain-burny and AP-inducing in a way that appeals to me.  If you like Java, you'll like this, and I have no idea why this is true.

Unusual, nasty mind-bender of a game. It sounds simple: build your outlets as close as possible by road to the appropriate factory. The trick is that players can't* build roads directly: instead, land is expropriated for roads, as necessary, to enforce the guarantees that a) all roads are connected and b) all factories/outlets (and potential factories/outlets) are reachable.

One of those games that rapidly goes from unbearably open (no idea what a good move looks like!) to claustrophobic; the magic is in that transformation, when whole swaths of the board are expropriated and some players are cut out.

I have the Plenary edition, which is hideous; the other components (like microscopic claim markers) are also dreadful. But it's worth it.

07 JUL 2009 - The artwork is blah. The game is challenging. Managing the streets/board is not very elegant. However, I really enjoyed playing it.

I have only played once as a 2-player game...it works as a 2-player, but I think at least 3 players will be a better game due to the auction mechanism. This is a game where you really can screw with other people. I got royally screwed at the beginning due to the auction mechanism and my 'friend' taking advantage of how the rules worked -- I ended up with two outlets at the maximum distance away early on. However, I was then able to make strategic plays to force him to move further and further away until he had the same problem. We ended up tied at the end, but he won because he had more money than me as I'd grossly overbid on a property I desperately needed.

Looking forward to playing this game again with 3.

I've been wanting to try this older Friedemann Friese game for a while now and finally got the chance, but after learning the rules and playing the game, I'm still not sure I understand it, and am definitely sure I couldn't play the game without someone there to help walk me through it. Basically it's a blind bidding auction game combined with a tile placement game where you're trying to bid on tiles so you can add them to the board and build them as close as possible to their matching tile. It would be simple enough if proximity weren't determined by a byzantine road network system (as opposed to actual distance) wherein the roads are not built by the players, but rather by the game, and only when absolutely necessary to keep the road network linked together throughout the board. Every time a tile is placed you need to check to see whether any roads are necessary to avoid splitting the road network up into multiple pieces. It sounds fairly simple, but in practice I found it surprisingly hard to predict when and where roads would be placed. I'm sure this would get easier with experience, but then all you'd be left with is a blind bidding tile placement game that doesn't seem to have much going for it.

Only one play so far. Fun game... but was hampered by two problems. One - on our first play the understanding of the laying of streets was argued about for awhile - and I was playing with 5 experienced gamers!

Wow! What a splendid little game. The rulebook is awful, and two of the player colors are virtually indistinguishable, but the latter problem is easily fixable since all that identifies a player are generic small wooden cubes (just get some in a different color when you have a full compliment of 5 players at the table). 

Fresh Fish is a brain burner with a sizable dose of luck thrown in the mix. Now, this should be an awful combination, but the game mechanics are just so unique and game play is so FUN that it doesn't matter. You may get screwed by luck (and God knows other players are trying as hard as possible to screw you), but the experience is just so tense and engaging, trying to make things work, that you can't be upset. It helps that the game is reasonably short (30mins?). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's probably a sign of my opinion of the game that six years separate my two plays of it, but I actually do like it.  I understand the concept of how to place your cubes so that you can place your tiles in such a way as to force a road to your store through the expropriation.  My problem is that I can't always identify when expropriation should occur, so I misjudge where I should play my cube.  A certain spatial awareness of the game is necessary, but it's very counter-intuitive, and it requires at least one of the players in the game to be able to recognize when it should happen.  I'm not sure I'm that player.

Connect your booths with shortest distance to the delivery truck. Heavy thinking and paralysis possibilities.

What a superb game, even if you spend most of it trying to not do something stupid rather than try to do something clever. Oh and it has auctions, which is always a plus.

A mid-stream game, with an unusual theme.

Not as much of a brain burner as I thought it would be, but still a good mental workout. The expropriation rules are fairly easy to work with after a game or two - still possible to miss cases though.

Interesting game - different from just about everything else. . .

I did not like this game as much as other reviewers.. it just dont grab me.. components are not nice, especially with the colour blocks.. bidding are often boring affair.. some strategy in placing tiles to &#039;screw&#039; others but find this game very bland.. rules are also poorly written, best to have an experienced player explain..

Plenary Games English edition.  Complete and very good condition.  It even includes a set of (poorly) painted gold cubes which, I think, were intended for a sixth player.

Rating has gone up from 6 to a 7, now that I can sort of "see" the road rules. While getting decent plots to play on is important, the game is really all about being able to make the roads go where you want them to, in order to screw other players outlets.

Truly, a great theme gone to waste. Wait, what?

Played several times (with 3 to 5 players). An interesting game based on a clever idea. The expropriation rules are not that difficult to understand, but it can be tricky to figure out and play properly. In my last few games, I have used money as a tie-breaker only, which forces players to focus on distances on the board rather than allowing them to win by saving their whole cash.

A unique game concept.  I've played it a few times and still don't have a strong sense of how to best play it.  But I really enjoy trying to figure it out each time we play.  We've gotten pretty good at knowing when and where the roads show up.  I'm still a ways from figuring out the best cube placement though.

one of FF's best designs I think.  Needs better explainations in the rules though

I really like this game, my wife less so. I find the rules for the roads tough to get my brain around but that makes the game more fun. I am always willing to play this :)

tile laying game -- must try!  I got it from a trade, and have now played twice.  it is definitely a brain burner, and also the instructions do a poor job of conveying the limitation on tile placement.  but somewhat fun.

I definitely don't have the faculty to easily visualize the road placement/blocking -- which means I just don't have what it takes to play well, and don't enjoy the game.  Interesting concept, but far too difficult for me to plan ahead. I'd enjoy it much better as a light computer game.

Fun game. Too many variant rules. Not everyone can see how roads are built which spoils the game.

RATING: 7.5
A very difficult game to wrap your head around.  The placement of cubes to reserve spots for buildings isn't as obvious at the beginning until the board starts to fill up.  The road construction is probably the hardest concept to understand and visualize.  It is true that the blind bidding aspect as well as the huge swing of luck due to the random tile draw sort of hurts the gameplay, but I believe Fresh Fish to be a refreshing design regardless.  While not as accessible as Friese's other titles, definitely one of his better work.

Not fun for me; more of an exercise.

RATING: 7.5
This isn't a game, but rather a full-blown reenactment of the entire submarine campaign in the Pacific Theatre for the entire war.

Playing the short patrols is fine, but they're included just to get the mechanics of the sim down... the real "game" is in doing thousands of missions over and over again.

While it's not bad, I don't find this an incredible experience. I refuse to do this with a paper and counter setup, as Vassal will eliminate the need to keep a table set up for over 200-PLUS hours of "game" time.

Still, it is interesting and frustrating -- and I'm sure a lot less than it was for the brave souls that actually participated in this endeavor.

RATING: 10
A tour de force simulation of the Untied States' submarine campaign in the Pacific.  Epic in scope and depth, it is not for the faint of heart or those who desire to see tactical interactions.  Even so, tension abounds in combat, and strategic planning is a complicated mix of resource management and risk taking.  As the game's designer has said, Silent War-and its companion game for the Atlantic, Steel Wolves-are simulations designed for those who enjoy being the Grim Reaper's accountant.  A downside for many will be extensive repetitive tasks, but these are necessary to provide the statistically accurate results that are at the core of this game, while at the same time providing a combat narrative to the player.  But for those willing to put in the time and effort, it will provide an experience like no other.

This is the game that brought me back into boardgaming.  Very well done solitaire design.   The Cyberboard and Vassal modules for this game allow me to play out any of the big campaigns.  Excellent game!!

Played the full campaign game using Vassal.  Took a year.  Very enjoyable.

Replaying the full campaign started 2/2011. Using VASSAL and IJN.  Great stuff!!

One of the best solitaire games. The only drawback is that you need to have the stamina of an accountant.
In the first period of the war you curse the bloody torpedos, which were also historically lots of duds. So in the beginning it is very hard to reach a reasonable tonnage score, otherwise you will be relieved of command. 
When you consider to call it a day, there is always another sub with which you want to finish a patrol, and then another and another etc. 
I would have wished, though, that there were more War Events to enliven the monotony. Anyway, go and get it.
Looking forward to the sequel Steel Wolves: Submarine warfare in the Atlantic.

RATING: 8.25
One of the best Solitaire game ever. Historically and statistically perfect although rules are quite simple. So historically perfect that the "nothing happens" effect of the lonely hunts in the ocean has a great part in the (long) game with no proportional reduction of the "house keeping" work the system requires. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
If you are looking for a game that lets you sneak up on enemy ships, get them in your sights and then sink them with a salvo of torpedoes you'll need to look elsewhere! Silent War is an operational level game that lets you manage the entire US sub fleet in the Pacific and challenges you to do better than the actual participants did. As interesting and unique the theme is it really has more in common with accounting than warfare. The individual scenarios are fairly quick but are determined with some of the many die rolls. There's not much to ponder over, just roll the dice and see what happens. The campaigns and some of the multi-sub scenarios are more involved but also much longer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
One of the best Solo-games I ever played. Simulates the sub-war really well and gives you a tense feeling when approaching a convoy. The rules are detailed but not overly complex and it provides a lot of gaming for the money. Started with the campaign game and don't feel overwhelmed by the rules. Includes smaller scenarios to but wasn't my cup of tea when the game arrived - jumped fully in. 

Hopefully they do a reprint because I need a new map - my was a bit beaten when the game arrived (even if it was originally shrink-wrapped).

RATING: 6
This is strictly a simulation. And it is a mini-monster. The full campaign simulation takes around 140 hours. The rules are very easy for such a monstergame. Aside from the large campaigns you can play short single submarine patrols. The patrols are not very satisfying, use only a portion of the rules and just make you learn the combat rules. 

Fortunately compass games designed some mini and short campaigns available to download on their website. They make the game playable for a lot more people and you get a glimpse into the full campaign game, because they use the same rules with less submarines and zones of operation. The game stays as close as possible to the historical situation. It's not about action. That makes it a little dry at times. 

The game is beautiful and very well designed, but i can't see me playing this very often. And for me every game i can't finish in 2 hour evening sessions within 4 days is a bit more than i can take :-)

But, i want to say this again: it is a really fine monster!

A good "true" solitaire game.  This one is not quite equivalent to RAF for me and I give the nod to RAF because of theme and the mechanics of RAF don;t seem like I am doing the same thing over and over (though I am of course).

This sub sim does get repetitive but if you like subs this is a good choice for solitaire.

Try the mini-campaigns.

It´s a bit effording to coordinating all these USS-boats in the pacific. The mark XIV is a real weak torpedo in 1941/42, so the first 16 months of war, was real luck for the Japanese merchant ships. The playtime is about 48+ hours! I played with VASSAL and the IJN Expansion, that adds more of the heavy enemy vessels.

All around great game/simulation with excellent components (wish the game map was mounted).  Single patrols are interesting, but the game's real strength is in the campaigns (check the web for additional campaign scenarios).  Strategic situation requires you to work with what you have, accept the fact that you will miss your target much of the time, and maintain a balance of boats deployed across op areas and bases.  Keeping a reasonable percentage of your fleet on patrol each turn can be a challenge.  

Historical and simulation aspects are spot on, and rules are complete without needless complexity.  Not for everyone (my wife thinks I'm crazy), but a great addition to the canon of solo war games.

RATING: 7
A solitaire simulation of the submarine war against Japan, this is an attractive game with some fairly simple systems driving an immense simulation in both time and space. The solitaire nature works well in the early war years, as poor quality subs, skippers and torpedoes conspire to drive you to distraction. You can't hit anything, and when you hit something, you often can't sink it. But the odd triumph keeps you going, the attack procedure is neat and quick and delivers a strong narrative, and the wider campaign gives it all a broader meaning. I managed 6 months with the super VASSAL module before it got too much, and there's a chance I'd go back, as I'd love to see the war develop and those damn torpedoes improve. Fun is probably not the right word - but it is compelling. Blair's 2 volume Silent Victory is the perfect complement, with its detailed listing of patrols and sinkings matching the game perfectly. Hats off to anyone who goes the distance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Seems like this will become one of the solo classics.  The only downside is the short scenarios ("patrol games") are really just demos of the mechanics with luck being a huge factor.  The game really shines when you take on the challenge of a campaign.My initial thought when I first heard of the game was too much money for a topic I'm not that interested in.  I finally gave in and bought it because of the solo aspect.  Now, I'm sold on the system and will buy any expansion they put out.

RATING: 7
I don't play many solitaire boardgames, so I'm having trouble rating this one.  Solitaire boardgames have a tough mountain to climb, as they have to answer the question: Why do this rather than read a book or play a video game?  Silent War does a pretty good job of answering that question: to immerse yourself in the history of a conflict in a way that you can't in a book or videogame.  That is, I think what would make an interesting solitaire boardgame to me is similar to what would make a good book.  How much I can learn about the period, is it interesting, well researched, does it have good production qualities.  Silent War gets pretty good marks for these attributes, but I don't see any solitaire game having the legs of the better multi-player games.  There's only so much you can do in a solitaire system.  But I did have fun learning about the period, which I think is the only reason to look into games like this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Based on two scenarios, this game delivers easy gameplay with a nice narrative in a short amount of time.  And as these quick play options are not the whole game, Silent War could be a rewarding experience  when playing through a campaign or two.
A 6 - based on first two scenarios.  I believe the rating will go up after a campaign, when throwing in Super Skippers, wolfpacks, better torps, and more battles.

The designer/developer notes peg this game pretty well, when they state that the game is more a simulation, and less a wargame.  Because of this (and because it's a game designed for solitaire play), the game is a little light in the strategy department.

However, because of the simulation value, the game makes for a fascinating study of the submarine campaign, with surprisingly historical results, in terms of tonnage and ships sunk.

I don't know how much replay value the game actually possesses, but as a full campaign game can take literally dozens of hours, I think I'll have my money's worth of enjoyment and fascination, after only playing it once.

RATING: 8
I'm unaware of too many other games on this subject (US Sub Ops in PTO), but this one is more than decent. If you don't mind a game that has a certain amount of repetitiveness and do enjoy watching the campaign evolve slowly over time (and I do), then this is a winner. If not, there are also a lot of scenarios with smaller scopes and timeframes that will probably be a lot of fun.

That said, the game gives you surprisingly few meaningful decision points other than whether or not to reattack or whether to go for high tonnage vs easy pickings in the early game when you are trying to decide between hitting your tonnage numbers to keep the game going or your total ships sunk to improve your torpedoes. I recommend playing a turn every day or two to keep it fresh, and definitely using the VASSAL module to do so. 

IJN expansion seems to be more for completists than to add much other than a couple of extra rules from the follow-on game, Steel Wolves, but it doesn't require significantly more work to execute, and you'll certainly see a wider range of naval vessels than you would with the base game, so that's always a good thing. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Who would have guessed - a complex underlying simulation based on statistical data that is both easy to play and one heck of a lot of fun!  You can run a single sub patrol in a few minutes, or play out a campaign (where the game really shines) over part or all of the war, with every US sub that served in the Pacific.  If you enjoy solitaire games at all, GET THIS GAME.

For those of you getting frustrated in the early war, try a later war patrol or campaign; historically, the sub commanders were tearing their hair out in frustration for at least the first six months of the war.  They had passable to poor subs and torpedoes that simply DID NOT WORK.  Face it, at the start of the war the Mk-XIV torpedo had THREE major defects - the magnetic exploder didn't work, the contact exploder USUALLY didn't work, and it ran too deep.  You WILL understand the sub skippers' frustration if you go sailing out of Manila in December, 1941, and you can count every sinking as a real victory.  If you're trying a patrol, DO NOT do the first patrol in the book unless that's precisely what you want.  On the other hand, take a Gato or Balao out of Pearl in early 1944, and let the fun begin....

Very good solitaire game.  Definitely suffers from rinse-n-repeat, but it didn't get too tiresome and I found myself getting engaged in trying to sink tonnage.

I'd bring it out again.

Began playing full campaign around Christmas and was still working on getting through 1942 by middle of May. It has times that are fun, but is a game that demands all of your time for a really, really long time. It can get really monotonous too as each week involves a lot of battles that are very similar to each other. Once you get a handle on the rules, it just isn't that much fun.

(These comments are based on an abortive attempt to play the long campaign scenario) 

It's not overly complex, but it's a grind! The same processes, over and over. Yes, it's a thrill when you actually sink something (4 ships in 3 game weeks so far), but, at least in the early stages of the war, it's few and far between. It's heartbreaking when you have a 20k ton oiler lined up in your sights, a perfect solution on the TDC, and you miss! (damn that -2 torpedo modifier!) It can also be difficult to know where to send your subs, and the early model boats are particularly ineffective. OTOH, I haven't lost a sub, yet.

Some minor problems I've noted - 
It would help to have a second person present to help draw chits for targets, TDC solutions, etc..  
Otherwise it's just too easy to "accidentally" see what you're drawing, and decide to make a 'less than random' choice.

For all but the shortest patrol scenario, you need to leave this up for a long time.  Otherwise, it's just too tedious to put up, take down, put up, ad nauseum.  If you don't have the room, forget it.
However, the map itself will fit on a standard card table.

All in all, it's pretty cool, but the dice rolling tedium this game requires makes it difficult to  sit through for more than an hour at a time. Which means that some of the longer scenarios could take quite a while.  The whole campaign could end up lasting just as long as the actual war!

One important fact:  THIS IS NOT A GAME!!!!
This is an Historical Simulation.  The difference, at least for me, comes down to the elusive and unquantifiable "fun factor."  I just didn't find it very fun at all.

Physically, it is a very attractive product.  All the game charts are in full color, the counters are heavy stock and beautifully illustrated, the map is large enough to provide plenty of room for all the counters.  A very well-produced item.

Bottom line: Is it worth getting? If you are the kind that likes simulations vs games, and as long as you keep in mind that you ain't gonna play this in an afternoon, then Yes.  Remember, it's a long-term investment of your time.
If that isn't you, pass on this one, and find something a little more fun.

As a Simulation: 9.5  
As a Game: 3

Well produced game.  I wanted to like it, but it felt very dry and mechanical.  For me, the game failed to engage the imagination and to capture the excitement and flavor of submarine warfare.  I'm sure that it's a fine simulation, but I didn't enjoy it as a game.

I rated the game a 4 because I'm unlikely to play again.  If you are seeking a solitaire game, add one to my rating.  If long playing time does not deter you, add one to my rating.  Finally, if you love submarine games, add one to my rating.  

All in all, I prefer the AH title Submarine http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3083/submarine (a tactical level game with no strategic element).

Heard good things about this from Joe Steadman on the old Dice Tower podcast.  A lot of detail in this game.  I have all of the components carefully organized.  Found it at an out-of-the-way hobby shop in Cincinnati, Ohio, while I was traveling there to visit family.  Game was pretty pricey, if I remember correctly.

Good and solid solitaire play, but be aware, the campaign system is monstrous, not that the rules are gigantic (they are really streamlined) but because of the number of submarines and the time frame, from the 2nd week Dec 41 to the end of the war!!! Virtually all submarines from the US that where on the PTO are represented in the game!! Fantastic!!

I have about a play and a half of this game, although my one full game ended at the first checkpoint when I didn't sink enough tonnage to keep going.

It was enjoyable, but it's much more of a simulation than a game.  If that's what you are looking for (and I was) then this may be the game for you.

I'll probably try its sister game next:  Steel Wolves

Acquired Jan 08 - Just played the patrol 3x so far.  Eager to play the campaign. Downloaded mini-campaigns from consimworld to try. Feb 08 - Completed mini-campaign, lost full campaign at first Career Longevity Check and have restarted Full campaign.  Fantastic Sim that totally sucks one in, despite the repetition/die rolls, there is a tension and eagerness that drives the campaign forward.  Changing rating to 9/10 to represent the addiction that keeps me up until 2am playing this game! As last night was a 3am finish.  How many solitaire simulations lasting 150  hours can keep you playing constantly.  Play is repetitive at times, but the tension and immersion are unequalled.

RATING: 2
played 2 turns of the campaign, drew dozens of chits, rolled dozens of dice, and moved dozens of counters to sink a 1T freighter and lose 1 sub.  Probably a quite realistic simulation, but the player choice:roll/chit pull ratio seems very low to me.  Add in the amount of time required to play, and it just isn't high on my list.  Components are top-notch, research is impressive, but the game is just not compelling; almost hoping that I rolled a 'no contact' so that I didn't have to draw a dozen chits to just miss. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Really detailed and fun for ME. I must warn you its really only for the dedicated and grognardy at heart. I love the chit pull system combined with convoy interaction which does a good job at simulating the frustration of submarine warfare of the time. I have only played the complete campaign (full war time frame) but scenarios are included that take less time.

RATING: 9
Wow, very cool solitaire game.  Really gives you the feeling of being the overall submarine commander.  You'll cheer when your boys score a big hit, and pull your hair out as those horrible early-war torpedoes fail to work time and time again.  Certainly can get repetitive in play, but keep your eye on the big picture and the chit pulling moves along quickly.  Once the play sequence is learned the game really moves along quickly.

Really good solitaire designs are rarer than hens' teeth in this hobby, and that's why I rate this design so highly-- it's a really good solitaire design that doesn't have to rely on paragraph booklets, random card draws or even a lot of dice rolling as you move from zone to zone (though you do indeed have to flail away at a 1D6).  I really like this one.

RATING: 4
This is a strategic sub game that gives you very few strategic decisions to make. Instead, you get some not very exciting operational deployment decisions followed by a mind numbingly repetitive and seemingly infinite loop of very obvious tactical engagements powered by an unbelievably clunky and time-consuming chit pull mechanic. 

As a sim, it's very carefully designed to achieve realistic results but there's no game to speak of so...why not just read a book on the subject? It would certainly take less time and cost less money.

Component quality is the usual from Compass Games (i.e. fairly attractive if you don't mind everything being a bit thin and glossy) but one gets the impression that this is only really destined to be played on Vassal. I'm sure that cuts down on some of the mechanical drudge work but I suspect it's still a rather hollow and mindless exercise.

I am playing the whole war campaign scenario, so each logged play represents one game session towards that goal.
  My Grandpa served on subs in the Pacific during the war and I have always found submarine warfare fascinating, so this game is right in my wheelhouse.  I have found the rules to be very simple to understand and well laid out for use during play.  The individual sub actions are very abstracted as this is a strategic game- but it really, really works!  I already feel invested in every subs patrol and am on the edge of my seat for every die roll....excellent game!

Interesting campaign on sub-warfare in the Pacific.  What knocks its rating down for me is the hundreds of combat resolutions and the set-up required for each resolution -- not to mention all the die rolling for each sub as it transitions.  I can only take this for so long before I have to put the game away.  Nonetheless, I expect to pull Silent War out here and there, though that means I won't even complete a short campaign for several years.

This game is not everyone's cup of tea. It's more like a simulation than a game. There are decisions to make and they really do effect the game, but there are few of them (a bit like RAF:Battle of Britain, which is also a campaign simulation).

If you like RAF:BoB, you'll like Silent War. Luckily there are several scenarios, but beware: the whole campaign will take a year or so to play. ;)

RATING: 9
Stellar.  Intuitive rules, a riveting "one more turn" factor, plenty of tension.  The components look great.  You can play a 15 minute patrol or a 150 hour campaign, all using the same essential turn structure.  I've been looking for a solitaire wargame for awhile, I had REALLY built up expectations for this (and sort of expected to be disappointed), but it is just fantastic.  If you're remotely interested in solitaire wargaming, pick up a copy.

Update: I'm about 20 hours into my first campaign, I'm about to get releived of duty for failure to send enough tonnage to Davy Jones's Locker, yet this game might move up to a "10" in a few weeks . . .
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This was a game, that I really wanted to play. I bought it at the beginning of 2011 but tried it only at the end of June. The reason is I knew the game had to be kept flat for a long time, so I went for it only after making my special gaming plate.

This is rather a simulation than a game. The rules seem to be  hard but after playing a few turns everything becomes crystal clear (in the rare cases it doesn't BGG always provides the correct answer). 

Now to my opinion: I was disappointed. I like solitaire games but I do not think Silent War will become one of my favourites. There are to few decisions to be made, the turns become very schematic and so you become bored quite quickly. The playing time for the campaign mode is hilarious (I managed to play to the end of February 1942 - comfortably reaching the tonnage ratio needed to proceed). And finally the thing that bored me the most: the war mix. Drawing new counters for each submarine was a real nightmare. Even when I started to return to the cups only the revealed counters the entire process was such a waste of time. Here is a big advantage of the Vassal module over the real game...

Final verdict:
9,5 if I were to rate a simulation.
6 when rating a GAME.

A very excellent simulation of submarine operations in the Pacific Theater. It allows you to simulate a single patrol, or the entire war, but at a level that's more sim than game. While you can bring your own narrative to the events, those looking for an action packed sub combat sim probably won't be sated by the more abstracted combat system used to determine an individual subs success or not.

This game is ideal for long term table/wall setup, where you can pop in now and then and run a few patrols for an hour or two and slowly watch the campaign progress, allowing you to compete with history. It could also be used to trigger separate tactical games (using another system, with some adaption) for those wishing to combine the best of both worlds.

RATING: 5
VERY realistic cosim about the subwar of the US in world war II. Perhaps the best simulation I know. But that´s the problem: It´s a simulation not a good game. It IS realistic, and damn, as a historian I really enjoyed its accuracy. But after some evenings playing war patrols and after trying one whole campaign my hunger for history has been totally satisfied. In a negative way. It´s everything but not a game - just dice rolling, beside "how do I place my sub in the attack rows and which target to select" no real decisions... and WHERE you are on the map does not really matter. Only one thing matters: Take some region with at least 8 or 9 coloured spaces. Then you have contacts and then you can perhaps hit a target. 

Especially in the early war years Silent War is only frustrating. Yes, it IS realistic when only three or four subs hit a target out of 30 or 40 on war patrol. But: That does not mean, it is fun to simulate this. The early -2 and -1 modifiers for hits are more than frustrating. For each sub you throw dice to look, if you encountered something. Then you throw dice to look, what size your target is: a convoy? A Task Force? Then you have to build up the combat screen - and that takes really time. Choose the chits, choose the TDC-Markers, choose the target to shoot at. Then throw dice and determine if you have hit something. And after all that you have to throw dice again and see if the torpedo not only hit the target but did perhaps have a malfunction or only damaged it (what in 90% of all cases means it can make it back to port). And after that: the counter attack - roll dice. Roll dice again and look if the sub has to return... You know what I mean? You have rolled dice about a dozen times ONLY FOR ONE SUB!!! And only to see that in 90% of all cases you did sink nothing and your sub has to return after simply one week (that is one game turn), because the -2 and -1 modifier again lowers endurance on sea. And there is nothing else in the game. Yes, you hear right. Nothing. The sparse war events that may occur are really nothing to mention - the real war could have had MUCH more impact on the game by more specific attacks on historical convois etc. But - nothing then really abstract impact by some sparse events.

Oh yes, it IS realistic, but is no fun. That´s simply a simulation. But I have to do other things than game on for about a year REAL TIME to get through a campaign - meaning 178 evenings or more of nothing than dice-rolling and getting frustrated because your wife shouts for you to undertake nice things ;) And you do nothing than... yeah, rolling dice and looking on the map and get more frustrated and more frustrated... So this is a simulation and no real game - take it on a wooden board and take your turn every evening after work... :) Make at least half of a turn each evening (when about 30-40 subs are in sea, when there are less because of many repairs you should try to make one whole turn, i.e. a week in the game). That takes about one up to two hours each day. We will see when you are ready at this pace. And even a single war patrol is nothing then the above stated dice-rolling. No offense meant - I really WANTED to love the game, but I can´t... :(

It´s a well done simulation, but even for this I can´t show enough enthusiasm to waste dozens over dozens evenings...

RATING: 7.5
Tough game to rate.. On one hand its quite a lot of fun, but on the other its also disappointing. 

The bits are excellent quality, nicely illustrated and dripping with theme, as are the rules which have excellent historical notes (but i wish there were more..). Unfortunately the rules are also somewhat vague due to what feels like a loosely defined turn structure and special events which dont always interact in a nice way. If you read the FAQ it is mostly all clear (except you'll still be scouring the net to figure out RTB) and its actually an incredibly simple game.

The game itself is repetitive and rarely requires much decision making by the player[i] yet somehow it is also incredibly addictive and exciting[/i]. I think its partially because it sucks you into its theme but also because it has some addictive video game like qualities. 

[i]Just.. one.. more.. patrol[/i].

Silent War will suck up your free time more than any other boardgame but in the end its worth it.. I think.

I had hoped for more decisions and less repetition. But this is still good.

I bought the 2008 reprint.

This game is awesome. It really is playable, and I like the the Operational and Tactical aspects of the game. It's nice that while combat is abstracted you still have some tactical decisions to make, especially with regard to who you target, what attack column your sub is in, and whether or not you should re-attack.

Really fun.

Lots of dice rolling, but it's all based on probability so it never feels completely random.

This game is so excellently researched as well. Simply an amazing simulation!

Damn those -2 torpedoes!

Let's see...I rarely have a whole lot of free time...I've had minimal wargaming experience...I know absolutely nothing about submarine warfare in WWII...I have a couple cats who'll probably knock over every piece...I don't have a spare room in which to set this up...etc.  Nonetheless, it's really relaxing (almost hypnotic, after a while) to sit down and play through a turn, and, despite being somewhat complicated, the rules become rather intuitive over time.  It's doubtful that I'll ever complete the overall campaign, but I feel I've already received my money's worth.

New game company offer...a solid and excellent solitaire game design on the submarine warfare in WW2.  U.S. submrines (you) take on Imperial Japanese Navy in the vast ocean in the Far East.  A very nice solitaire gaming idea. Ranked top 10 wargames here in BGG when it was first released because of its realism and accuracy of the simulation.  It seems that it is a very tough luck in a submarine warfare in general, especially for the small skipper scenario like the first one S38 7th Patrol in the Soloman. After 3 weeks on patrol from Brisbane, not a single hit could be inflicted on the Japanese convoys.  On some occasion, when you make the contact, you really don't need to place all the convoy ships on all the 4 columns of the tactical display if you consider that there is really not a chance to survive the endurance check after the combat, meaning that the skipper had run out of ammo or submerging too long out in the open sea, and had to return to base for now.  It's better to choose at least a Gato class skipper scenario to have a longer time to accomplish the target no. of ships and tonnage sunk.  The meaty game is in the campaigns (there are 6).  It is a tough system to beat and thus requires a cool mind to beat it.  The Game Designer Notes are one of the best written I have ever seen.  Plus the complete OOB of the U.S. submarines, it keeps me wanting more out of it...

Finished watching Gregory Peck's Desitnation Tokyo - not a spectacular movie but more of a propaganda. The last 10 minutes submarine sinking the Japanese carriers and subsequent counterattack with depth charges by the destroyers are the only part worth watching. Nonetheless, the movie prompted me to take a revisit to this solitaire game and wanting to become a submarine commander with this game again. I have to read the rulebook again to recall and capture of my memories about this game in my first play back in Nov 2006. I should try a larger submarine in future to test how it goes. Of course, order from the High Command is to sink more tonnage!

Very detailed, very streamlined.  This is an interesting solitaire affair, that can end up playing like a spreadsheet if you don't "get into it."  Keeping a log of the exploits of the individual subs can go a ways toward keeping you playing those longer scenarios.  You'll also need a good organizational system, because there are lots of counters.  I enjoyed my games, and it will hit the table again (but you need a dedicated game space for anything but the short patrol scenarios).

Difficult to rate this one.  Although I recognise that it is a very clever design and close to the history, the full campaign game is just too long.

For the first nine months or so, you're carried along by the challenging quarterly tonnage sunk requirements, the urge to sink enough ships to earn a torpedo upgrade and by the ever present danger that the Philippines will fall.  After that, the endless repetition of individual patrols gets boring and the prospect of carrying on with more of the same until you sink 5.5 *million* tons of enemy shipping becomes unthinkable.

Fortunately, the designer is coming up with a steady stream of shorter scenarios and I would strongly advise you to play those rather than embark on the full campaign.

Must play the campaign game in order to truly experience this game, and doing so can take over your life and become an obsession. When properly played to minimize time in transit the campaign will end in the spring of 1944 (true for the two full campaigns I've completed). This suggests that hindsight and possession of far more knowledge about the situation than was afforded to Lockwood & Co. skews the campaign results.

The game is extremely good.  The full campaign game is massive in it's scope and detail on an operational level.  It's almost too much.  The smaller campaigns, including the ones available for download from Compass Games actually bring the game into the range of what could be completed by an "average" gamer.  The only thing that is missing is the ability to develop a single captain over the course of the war.  I would like to be able to have "me" as a sub captain and go through the war, earning promotions, better boats, medals etc.

RATING: N/A
A serious sim powered by reams of hard data and sporting state of the art graphic and information design; obviously a deeply tested, lovingly crafted system. But, as the polarized ratings here suggest, it's not for everyone. The best comparison is probably to something like the Strat-O-Matic sports sims. This game is a statistical model with which you, as the player, can interact. 

I respect the heck out of it, but I'm honestly not sure I enjoy it. There's just a *lot* of work involved in setting up and taking down the combat displays for each sub's contacts--something you'll be doing dozens of times a turn in the large campaign scenarios. I don't mind the low early war kill numbers--I don't need a shoot 'em up--but the constant manual tedium detracts from any sense of immersion, which for me is the real pleasure of solitaire games. (Someone upstream saying that they almost hoped they rolled no contact so they wouldn't have to bother is a sentiment that rings true.) The patrol scenarios, meanwhile, are too slight and dice-driven to hold much interest beyond being a tool for learning mechanics. I'm leaving it unrated. At the same time, I will almost surely get its sibling, Steel Wolves.

Solo game that treats about the american submarine war in the Pacific vs Japan. A good playing system, completed by IJN. When you contact some ship, you don't know if it will be a big one, or small, even if it will be a warship or a petroleum or cargo one... until you end the process. Then you have the option to fire or not, but... will you get the target? May be you miss it, or the torpedo will not explode, specially if at the beginning of the war. And if you get the target, will it sinks, or only be damaged? You must again end the process.
As a negative note, it takes a very very long time play (some 150 hours) the complete campaign, but you have the option to play shorter scenarios instead. However, to play the full campaign is a challenge!

A tough solitaire game that is somewhat of a dice fest, but it is very fascinating...for a niche game.  Do yourself a couple of favors...Download the rules and scenarios, as well as the FAQ/ errata, so the originals last more than a few hours, and download and play on Vassal, to save your sanity, and your wife's.  Long play time makes this vital.

LONG! Wow, this is not a short game by any means. Granted, I'm still learning the rules (and really, the only way to do that is by playing), but each turn can take several hours, depending on the die rolls. The longest part is setting up each engagement. It is a challenging game in that it can get frustrating when your best subs manage to consistently miss or fail to scratch those big, juicy, unguarded targets (and then have to return to base, get damaged on the way and spend weeks in drydock; big dumb idiots). The variable TDC markers can make a tough sub nearly impotent.It's a nice looking game, but it's too long and too repetitious.

An excellent solitaire simulation of the American WW2 submarine campaign against Japan.  Has both quick play patrol scenarios and long, richly detailed campaign game.

One of the best solitaire games out there.
As the turns are weekly, the full  4 year campaign is not for the faint of heart.

I finally got this on the table.  There is a lot to like about this game.  It's an innovative simulation that represents the attritional nature of the submarine campaign very well.  Silent War can be engaging and very frustrating at the same time.  When contact is made it takes a little while to set up everything on the combat display - so it's frustrating when you can't even get off a shot or come up empty handed which is often the case. This is due to a variety of factors such as high ASW values, Diligent Escorts, Combat Events, bad torpedoes, bad positioning, etc. Of course when you do sink a ship, you feel that you earned it.  I do recommend this game.  While some will find it engaging, others may find it to be a bit dry.

Interesting tactical sequence but the strategic aspects are a little too abstracted.  Strategic planning is limited to cherry picking the best areas with your best subs and putting the vunerable subs in safer areas.  You would not go to Alaska if the events didn't force it.  As long as you have all your subs in an effective area, there is little reason to move into higher risk areas.

Too many dice roll and the game is just a question of luck: you send our submarine to an area, you roll a die and see what happen; then you begin a new turn. Even if my comment is voluntaril exagerated, it's not far from the truth.
Silent war is a game of hazard and not of strategy.

Great solitaire experience.  Takes a long time to do a full campaign, but if you've got space to set this up for a while, it's fun to do.  Recommend you use vassal for the combat aspect of the game, keeps things moving quickly without losing the map and cardboard feel of the main map.

Update:  After further plays I have downgraded this one.  Too repetitive, slow moving.  You're taking essentially the same steps, over and over and over again.  Just doesn't have the replay value.  I guess I'll go back to playing Ambush!

After a few patrol games and two turns into the campaign I tend to like the game. Gaming is fluid, but I am not yet sure if the scale is right to portray the whole sub war in the Pacific (only speaking for me, of course).

Rating based upon my initial play of a campaign game, which is still in progress.  As long as you don't mind LOTS of die rolling, this game builds a good amount of tension and suspense.  Is the target really a nice fat merchant ship, or is it a destroyer bent on sending you down to Davey Jone's locker?  Will you sink that carrier, or will your torpedoes bounce off, or even worse, circle around and hit you?

RATING: 9
I'm a few turns into my first campaign (Campaign 1). I've been playing on Vassal as I don't have the capacity to set up and store the physical copy right now. 

[b]What do I like:[/b]
:d10-1: I really enjoy the historical simulation. Playing the game seems more interesting and engrossing than a standard game as the pieces represent really men and equipment that fought and died.

:d10-2: Combat and transit rolls are tense because the loss of a sub could happen almost anytime.

:d10-3: Overall game play and sequence of play are fairly straightforward. The big picture is not complicated.

:d10-4: I enjoy the statistical nature of the game. It's fun to track the successes of subs that have sunk Japanese ships.

[b]What is tough about this?[/b]

:d6-1: The historical simulation. The outset of US submarine warfare against the Japanese in WWII was rife with unsuccessful patrols due in large part to faulty torpedoes. This is modeled well in the game. As such, it is hard to hit many targets at the beginning which can be frustrating. 

:d6-2: While I feel the overall play sequence and big picture is simple, there are many rules for uncommonly encountered situations. While a beginning player may understand the game flow quickly, there will be plenty of rule book referencing as uncommon situations pop up at nearly every segment through a game turn.

:d6-3: Errata. The errata and FAQ documents need to be read and understood well. Unfortunately some ideas were worded incorrectly or vaguely in the original rulebook. Download & become familiar withe the errata/FAQ.

:d6-4: Lots of charts and player aids are necessary for this game in addition to the FAQ/errata and frequent (initially) rulebook referencing.

:d6-5: Repetitious nature of combat may wear some players down over time.

[b]Overall thoughts[/b]

I've incorporated 100% of the rules from the IJN expansion into my play. I really enjoy what the expansion offers and recommend doing so. This is definitely a game for players interested in historical simulation, statistics, and a long campaign game. It requires space to hold the board and pieces setup over a long period of time or familiarization and use of the Vassal program. So far I'm really enjoying it and hope I'll have the determination and wherewithal to complete a whole campaign far into the future.

Part of my solitaire wargame collection. See my comments on Cartagena for how I nearly got away with adding two games to my collection without my girlfriend knowing. I've only played the patrol missions so far, where I found there was too much dice rolling for the sparse decision-making involved. You essentially have three decisions to make: which column to attack, which sub or subs to target, and whether or not to reattack. I'm hoping there's more brain food in the campaign games.

Ordered again, almost one year after first deciding to buy it, then changing my mind. I had been wrong to second-guess this game. It took me a year of searching to realize this and come back to it.

The components are beautiful.

After playing it on and off for a couple of months, and after much vacillation, I sold it. The repetitive physical procedure of the combat phases crossed over from being exciting to being too often annoying -- placing, say, eighteen counters, careful to place them face-down without looking first, turning over one of them, and aborting the phase. Also, I realized that I wouldn't be able to leave the game out on the table set up for a long campaign. I did enjoy playing the two mini-campaign games, and it's a very nice design, but I decided I'd rather move on to playing a different kind of game now.

The sequel Steel Wolves is under development now. It will likely be more complex, which I think will help. Silent War could really use one or two additional player-driven mechanisms to keep it interesting over time.

Attractive game. Once you master the system, the game is engaging. If you have trouble finding opponents to play other games, this might be the game for you. Although it's listed as such, I can't see this ever being played as a two player game.

RATING: 9
The reason I took off a point was I played the game so much that the Japanese ship counters wore out and did not hold up to the constant useage of being drawn out of a cup. I have played wargames since high school in the late 1960s and folks I can say that I have never played a more fun solitaire game than Silent War but RAF would be up there too. The research into the game and support was excellent. If you like solitaire games this game is for you. The last scenario I played I don't know if I was very lucky but I had moved from war period one (Dec.41) to war period three by December 1942. Which seems a bit unhistorical. Maybe because I was sooo good! Just kidding. But I never got a super skipper in the process. A great game!
***********
I am adding this section later Feb 2012 . I can not stess enough how bad some of the Japanese ship counters look. They are frayed on the sides and the color are faded. I don't think they would hold up for playing a campaign. I think the only way to play this without destorying the cup counters is to play it on VASSAL. I wonder if someone can come up with a chart to use instead. I should mention the tasks in this game are very repetative. I still do like this game.

[BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]SoloX.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] [BGCOLOR=#FF3300][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Wargame.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]   Well-regarded solitaire naval game.

Got it and played a couple short scenarios. I like it, but after a while the execution becomes very procedural, which is not atypical for many solitaire games, I suppose.

I made an excel spreadsheet to automate the hunting/combat tasks, thinking I might grind out the entire war, then ended up giving the game away. Picked up the Hunters instead - I think driving a single sub may be more fun and less tedious.

Now with more play time under my belt, revising my rating upward.  It's an amazing idea and probably the best topic for a solo wargame I've yet seen; a perfect meshing of theme and mechanics.  Anti-shipping operations at their heart are a cold and impersonal type of combat; this game manages to convey the mood of that type of warfare.  As you send out your steel wolves to prowl the seas for easy pickings you can imagine yourself in the shoes of Christie or Lockwood.  Carried it to Iraq with me and got many good yours of service from it.  All I had to take was the rulebooks and the reference cards, using the the Vassal module to keep the board and counters.

This game deserves great credit for its detailed OOB and modeling of submarine warfare and is a well designed game.  However, Players looking for a quick game will be disappointed. This game requires alot of time to enjoy the campaigns.  Quick patrols can be played but depending on the submarine capabilities and war period, you may play for an hour with not a ship sunk.  Realistic - yes.  Fun - ?   If you are a sub fanatic with months able to be devoted to this game then this game's rating will be an 8.5.  This is definitely a grognard game of Sub Warfare.  It resolves down to tactical scale but is more of a strategic simulation over the long haul of the Pacific War.

A good game if only because it will take you through the WHOLE submarine war in the Pacific against the Japanese in WWII.
While the game has many elements to it and it shares both a strategic and a tactical element to it, the game lacks choices. Most everything is a die roll. True you get to choose which op-area to send your subs, but there is no real purpose in going to a certain area over others. Unless of course you are ordered to by a game event roll.
Still I am enjoying the game; although I am keeping a log book of my submarine's activities, as well as using the IJN expansion module. This adds time to the game play but it is interesting to see how my subs are fairing in this titanic struggle.

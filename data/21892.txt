While I thought the mechanics were pretty interesting, it seemed as though the draw of the cards was really the decider. Almost always, everyone seems to buy all the cards they can, and then the auctions are pretty much decided from that point on. The decisions on what privileges to take also seemed pretty straight forward - points if you can get a coat-of-arms, etc; money if you're getting near a bottleneck and need a church or cathedral; and cards if someone's just going to steal your privilages.

Since you're not going to hold on to the highest thing in each category, plan a double move to grab the highest thing and then use the privilege to lock in one of the upper board things that can't be taken away.

It is clever how first the quantity and then the quality of the cards count in Augsburg's auctions.  This with the addition of holding bids and the inability to raise your bid if everyone else holds or passes gives auctions a distinctive feel.

The rest of the game is a rather less interesting system for acquiring money, cards and victory points (prestige).  The distribution of promissory notes and privilege cards and the frequent give and take of level tiles make this a highly tactical game.  You do what seems best at the moment of winning a bid. My preference is to play Augsburg with three players.  That bit more control and a slightly shorter playing time seem to make all the difference.


Artwork and production quality are just OK.  The English rules do a bad job of making a straightforward game seem more complex.

This is a good and fast playing auction game that centers on influence.  It has a bit of the feel of Prince's of Florence in that you are building your own player mat, but not with buildings.  It's honors you want.  Game play is smooth and uses an interesting auction that looks at both card quantity and the highest card value.  A good light to mid weight auction game that plays bigger than the smaller size box would indicate.  A strong game for the Alea mid-size games series. [GTI: TGCL]

Played rules incorrectly but enjoyed nonetheless.  Very much in the Stephan Br√ºck mould.  Felt similar to Louis XIV.  Hope to play again with wrinkles sorted.  Second play.  Less impressed.  Seems very difficult to catch a leader.  One player won two auctions in the first round and from the on was unassaiable.  Would like more ways to obtain prestige points.  Will try again.

Tentative rating after 1 playing. An auction game with important timing considerations for scoring. One either wins a round by bidding the most cards, or in the case of a tie, by having the highest card within the bid. After my one play, I wonder if the game would be a bit better with the tiebreaker being the total amount bid...

A deeply annoying and frustrating card game. Early gains seem based upon marginal wins through early card draw. These gains then compound into the ability to generate more cash and buy more cards. Cost of cards does not seem to reflect their potential (2 200 cards worth 2 & 3 are not worth the same as 1 17). The damming rule on the score chart at 25 and 45 points again just seems to benifit the early leader and simply exagerates the winning margin. In the last game two players could have won dependant upon final card draft, the fortunate one came first with a margin of nearly 30 points 50 points ahead of the 4th placed player. In one round I had 14 cards and despite contesting each auction lost every one. 

Simply put this is a card game with significant luck only slightly offset by player interaction. Neither well balanced, skilful nor enjoyable. Never to be played again.

It's not flashy, but it's pretty fun. It is a bidding game where you are trying to win two bids in a row. The dilemma is how to start. Do you go for money to buy bidding cards, jump ahead on points or start building to be able to break through scoring thesholds that everyone will be up against. You'll have to compete for the scoring threshholds eventually.....

RATING: 5
First impressions of this Alea title were positive from everyone in my group, an impression quickly dispelled with further plays.  The tragic flaw vitiating this otherwise exceptional game is the one-dimensionality of the strategy.  Everything revolves around the prestige point track and no dilemmas exist as to whether to pursue other tracks since, I must reiterate, everything hinges upon your success in the prestige point track.  Compounding matters, the privileges of the prestige track award the player with irrevocable point sources.  The only strategy present consists of timing your purchases of prestige points tiles and privileges to avoid the possibility of someone stealing them from you before the turn or before you get your privilege.  Obviously the crude mechanic of the church and cathedral attempt to mitigate the problem by penalizing excessive expenditures on prestige points, except the cathedral does nothing of the sort and the church is only a minor impediment.  All of these factors result in a game won long before its conclusion, a mortal flaw for any game.  The obvious solution requires opening up point sources and balancing the different tracks.  Concomitantly, these additions could enhance and texture the translucent theme.

Cambiado en la BSK a lani√±ademisojos por el Atlanteon+mamma mia, en Marzo 2012 (me regal√≥ un Black Stories 2 en P&P).
A√∫n sin probar.

Finalmente lo prob√© en Agosto 2013. Tiene un sistema de subastas peculiar... y el juego est√° bastante entretenido. Fue una agradable sorpresa. Hay un numero de rondas variable (numero de jugadores+2) y en cada ronda hay una fase de visitas en la que se hacen pujas por cuatro nobles. PAra pujar s√≥lo se pueden usar cartas de ese noble. Hay  una quita puja por maximiliano en donde ya se pueden usar cualquier tipo de carta. Cuando alguien gana una subasta, obtiene una carta que contiene tres privilegios de los que puede ejecutar dos.  Esos privilegios te permiten mejorar tu tablero para que en la siguiente fase de la ronda se obtengan mejores beneficios (pasta, puntos y pagar√©s o cartas).

Al final no es tan farragoso como parece tras una primera lectura del reglamento. Est√° bien y no es dif√≠cil. Insisto: Fue una sorpresa agradable.

RATING: 5.5
Okay, I'm not a big fan of auction games, and this one made a worse first impression than most.  First off, the mechanism where players can take scarce upper-level tiles from other players turned our three-player game into a zero-sum bloodbath, with tiles sometimes changing hands before their crucial power could be activated.  This was a problem particularly with the tile that lets you gain the ability to build churches and cathedrals, since there are victory point roadblocks beyond which you cannot pass without a church or cathedral.  It seems that there is only one path to victory (first get money, then get ability to  build church/cathedral, then put all effort into VP generation).

I could be talked into playing this again now that I have a better idea of the relative value of things, though.

Perhaps a few too many catch-up mechanisms and artificial rules to even the game.

Luck dependent on the cards drawn too. If you never draw a "17" then you're not likely to win any auctions. It's more cost effective to buy a "17" rather than  lots of the smaller numbers.

Don't like catch up mechanisms to help the loser.

This one is fine, quite fine and refined.  A pure, dry Euro if ever I saw one - just what I'd expect from Alea.  I got this because I'm an Alea addict, and while it is very good (I especially love the card bidding mechanism), it's just not really lots of fun with 2.  Ok, but trade-worthy.

RATING: 7
Enjoyable game with poorly written English rules.  All of the "do this to make sure nobody is cheating" stuff in the rules is odd...especially for a Euro game.  If you are playing games with people who cheat you should find new opponents.  Anyway, I enjoy the auction mechanics of the game and the money/VP engine building.  The card draws are a little problematic because there are only a few turns in the game (no time for the randomness to "even out") and getting sets of cards for 1 or 2 nobles is more useful than getting 1 card for every noble.  Still, I like it.

Playing again recently, this has solidified in my mind as a good, clever, but not great game. The balance just doesn't feel quite as tight as the best alea games, the money management and bidding decisions don't seem quite as nuanced as in other games in the line. But it's still a fun game - in the genre of trade-money-for-VPs-games like Saint Petersburg or Through the Ages, this seems the most successful of the lot. Also a few minor but troublesome usability glitches in the RGG version.

My previous comment about keeping the number of players up may not quite have been fair. My last play was with 3, and that worked quite well. Don't bother with 2, though.
---
Early plays were lukewarm, but this has grown on my significantly. I think one key is to keep the number of players up; I had a lot more fun with 5 than any other number.

It's a fairly by-the-numbers cross of Saint Petersburg and its "aquire cash generating or VP-generating assets" and an auction game, but both sides are twisty enough to make the game different. The auctions move quickly because they are poker-style. Cash doesn't beget more cash because you need to both invest the cash in debt to redeem in auctions as well as buy churches and cathedrals. And the ability to steal prizes from your opponents gives the game a nice interaction level.

So, Augsburg 1520 has a lot of what I like in a game: it's well-paced, it's got plenty of tension and player interaction, tough choices, and as an auction game it's got enough indirection to work. All it's missing is a good theme. I think the theme of debt cancellation actually works reasonably well, it's just *so* obscure an unexciting that it's a shame they couldn't have come up with something better.

Intense auction game.  Quite cutthroat, because there aren't enough of the really valuable tiles to go around, so you steal them from whoever has them, resulting in, at times, one acquiring a tile, and never seeing the benefit.  Game seems to be won or lost in the last round, as long as all players have been playing competently.  A certain (expensive) tile (I forget it's name) needs to be purchased for one to be able to progress past 45 points on the scoring track, and this tile is crucial, and it's not hard to end up in a position where you cannot purchase it, through timing, and/or lack of funds, and/or lack of cards to be competitive in the auctions.

The game I played seemed as if the game was going to be unbalanced from the start, but then managed to surprise me by unbalancing at the end as the player who streaked ahead on PP was unable to capitalise on this as they could not win a subsequent auction.

My feel is that the fact you can only really get PP frome one place means that this will very quickly lose its replayability, and after a few plays will be relegated to the back of a shelf.  I'll probably be happy to play another person's copy for a few games, but would not buy myself or really look to play again.

RATING: 3
Much too long and repetitive with 5 players. I fell in second place, 3 points behind the winner, and I didn't even do anything at all during the last 2 turns of the game. I even could have won if at the end of the 5th turn, the other players would have let me go back on my choice and let me take the card giving 7 points right away. In summary, with 5 players, the game is simply 2 turns too long. I would not play this again with 5 players, as it seems I've done everything there is to do in the game. Oh yeah, the theme is very thin. We're supposed to be bankers, but money is not worth anything at the end of the game? One player had a ton of money left with nothing to do with it.

aka: alea does mathy, Euro-inspired auction game with elements of poker.

I walked into this frankly not expecting very much, and I was pleasantly surprised by the way this game plays. Not a heavy alea classic, but more of a fun, quick, in-between games game which has some decent card play.

Players are essentially playing a game of cards that revolves around having the most cards of a given suit (5 suits). There are 5 auctions each round, and players bid using the physical number of cards that plan to play. Someone declares, for instance, 2. Then, the other players can either call or raise that bid. Once a number has been called out, then the auction is resolved, players flip up the cards in the numbers stated, and the player with the single highest value card (a number on the face) wins the auction. Second and third can also receive consolation money. When you win, you can basically advance on one of three tracks: money, victory points, or more cards. The victory point and card tracks also have side benefits. For instance, the victory point track can give you permanent tiles which give you even more victory points. The card track, rather importantly, allows you to build a church or a cathedral, which are each required to go over 25/45 victory points. 

During all of this, there is a little swap thing going on. Basically, each of the tracks has 4 levels of advancement. Each of those levels is short though, there aren't enough to go around. If a player wants to take something and it is not available, they simply take it from one of the people who has it, and that person gets a consolation VP or 100 bucks. This is the driving force for the game because the VP and card tracks each have potential ways to give you permanent effects that cannot be taken away, but to get those effects you have to win level 3 or 4 chit for that track, and then win another auction to get the special chit. The rub is that the other players will likely to be trying to steal that higher chit from you, so that you cannot get the permanent chit and run them over.

So, this game isn't all that heavy, but it is enjoyable in an Edel, Stein und Reich sort of way. This game is quite a bit heavier than that, and doesn't have any of the blind choices of ES&R, but for some reason, the games remind me of each other. They are not super heavy, but they do have some fun choices and are probably at their best when people can simply pull down the box and knock the game out quickly as a break in-between games. Much better than I was expecting given the lukewarm press on here. Only niggle: the way you get cards...largely random. The higher price of the higher numbered cards seemed to not sufficiently offset their value in winning auctions.

Very enjoyable, and firmly in the 'Euro' camp, complete with auctions, bidding and prestige points.  I felt a little handcuffed by the cards in my one play, but I think that's probably because I rarely took advances that would give me more cards to choose from, probably to my detriment.  Spent quite a bit of time discussing and thinking about this game after we played, which is a very good sign.  Want to play again soon.

Even more so than Thurn & Taxis (another popular game at the Gathering), this didn't do anything for me. I just feel like with modern boardgames, we should be past the point of mechanics like: "buy X; if there is no more available from the bank, choose any player who has one and take theirs". This is arbitrary targeted screwage. It's a flimsy catch the leader mechanic. I *really* don't like that. A more minor issue is that I don't care for the bidding system.

First impression: meh. The artwork is unclear and unappealing; and the options available to you as a player are limited and not very interesting. There are of course some small ways to balance bad luck of the draw a little, but it doesn't address the core issues of the game: not much to do, and from a certain moment onwards (once certain privileges have been 'built') even less to do. The game lacks tension, and a feel of progression. There's some jockeying for the first few levels of development, and after that it's just going through the motions for a few hands. It would probably have made a reasonable game in 1986 or even 1996, but in 2006 (when the game was published) it is just a license to burn money.

Augsburg 1520 is definitely not alea's finest hour, and I strongly suspect the publisher of having been in a drugged or inebriated state while signing the contracts. I cannot explain the inclusion of this mediocre title in an otherwise impressive lineup of quality games otherwise. In the future I'm hauling out another alea if I want something short and interesting to play.

I was concerned that this game had a runaway leader problem in it, however, after playing it 3 times, and the final time with all players having at least one game under their belt, it was a very tight, close game that came down to the wire.  
My two complaints with the game are  the pace and the instructions/components though.  Regarding the pace, in a 4 player game, this is a 30 auction game.  When everyone's focused, this becomes a really nice game that clicks along, but when it slows down, it can really drag.  The other problem is the instructions - it takes a while to really understand what is going on, and most of the confusion is due to the components not really being clearly distinguishable.  You really need to sit down with the rules and the game and set up a practice game before springing this on your group!
Aside from these two items though, I find this to be a superb auction game when played with equally experienced players.  Some complain about the auctions, however I find them to be a nice change from the normal Eurogame auction methods.

Players play a rich medieval money-lending family in Germany.  Each round, players bid "debt collection certificates" (i.e. cards) in five auction rounds, to try and reclaim debt in the form of royal patronage and favours.  Favours won lets you advance in three areas of prestige - money, nobility and offices.  Each area has its perks, but it's all about gaining prestige (victory points) - which is the nobility area.  However, you need to concentrate on your money (for more loan certificates) and offices (to build the mandatory churches and cathedrals) in order to continue to the quest for prestige.  Rather dense rulebook (footnotes!?) disguises a simple, albeit meaty auction game that plays surprisingly quickly.   One for auction fans.

Small-box Alea game that's interesting, but I just don't see it coming off the shelf too often in the future.  It has a clunky 'hold back the leader' situation and the bidding can be frustrating.

RATING: 8
A.. very odd game. The possibility for card screwage, especially in the first two rounds, makes me a bit more down on it than I would otherwise be. I also haven't played it with a small number of players, yet. It worked very nicely with 4 and 5, though. I'd like to play more of this one.

After another play: Okay, that game, I basically won by chance. Yes, my opponents made a couple of mistakes, but I got *amazing* cards for the entire game. When it just keeps handing you 16s and 17s, along with plenty of low-value cards to bulk up...

For some reason, I really enjoy this, despite the luck in it. Understanding when to spend your cards and when to hold them seems to outweigh the luck.

RATING: 7
Don't pass this up if you enjoy auctions games.  Timing is crucial as players can get stalled on the victory point track (as happened to me in my first game) if they don't manage money properly and play a balanced game concerning the three progress tracks on the board.  I look forward to exploring different strategies in the future- highly recommended.

This is a typical euro game, and you must juggle your income, debt certificates and prestige points.  Neat auction mechanic that really flourishes with four or more players, best with five.  Some nice levelling mechanisms to prevent a runaway leader.  The theme is also good.  It takes some work to get into this game, but underneath the somewhat dull looking components is a good game that is probably unappreciated!  I wonder about replay value, but time will be the test of that.  Enjoyed the first couple of plays so far!

I liked the way the auctions integrated with the timing decisions, and player interaction based on limited tiles. Yes, it's a bit lucky who draws the high cards, but you can't stay in the bid unless you have enough low cards, and if you're still in but don't win an auction, you get free money from the bank.

Although not text heavy, I struggled a little with the transalation. The terms used for the game parts didn't sit well with me, and I didn't connect well with the game. However, I did like the auction mechanism (ANOTHER new auction mechanism) and I liked the flow of the game. But, it just wasn't fun, and the rich got richer. If I played again, I would do better, but this one didn't grab me. (Note, I was sick while playing, having a bad allergy attack, which may affect my judgement).

My first try was with 3 players and I can see how more players can definitely kick the drama up a notch or two.  The bidding mechanic is simple and works very well.  I will review once I've had a few more games with 4-5 which seems to be the better fit.

Crystalline bidding mechanics coupled with a timing-based development game. It's very good. You often want to win a couple of successive auctions, but neither too early in the round (or you'll get overthrown in some area) nor too late (the good cards will be gone). Also you can try to lay low for the next "killer round". A lot of things to consider, a rich game.

RATING: 6
In Augsburg players try to gain influence with the mighty of the time by lending them money (or maybe I should rather say "giving them money" - you're not going to get it back). In essence, this boils down to blind bidding plus hand management.

The game plays fairly quickly, and what amazes me most about it is how incredibly balanced it is. It works with all players counts, and supports wildly different approaches all of which are viable. Final scores are usually close, certainly to a great extent thanks to the church/cathedral "roadblocks".

An auction game, and I always find auction games unnecessarily stressful. Hand management is a much more friendly way of selecting resources! The game does have some interesting features, but not enough to keep me entranced, and the components are just average.

On the basis of one play, I would tend to agree with the comments on luck being too much of an element in the card draws, particularly early in the game.  Also, I managed to come from way behind to second place, locking out two players who I felt had been playing better than me, simply because with a mitt full of cards I managed to win three of the final five auctions, thus thwarting their acquistion of cathedrals (which, admittedly, they had left to the final round, but then so had I!)  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The auction system where you bid a number of cards, regardless of their value, and only consider the high card played among the players tied for the high bid, makes this a great game.  The need to contribute to a church and then a cathedral to score victory points beyond 25 and 45, respectively, make the game a nail-biter.  Will you win an auction that gives you a purple action before you start losing victory points?  Will you intentionally leave yourself 500 guilders short of the cost of a church/cathedral, trusting that you'll either win an auction that gives you both the build and the 500 bucks, or that enough other people will build before you this turn that the building will cost you 500 less?  Fun, fun, fun.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Plays pretty fast.  The auction mechanism is decent, but perhaps less interesting than the offerings provided by some comparable euro games.  Perhaps more interesting is the way the auction interacts with the stealing of scarce tiles from other players; there is a race to gain benefits from these scarce tiles before other players have an opportunity to steal them.

Overall impression: it's a worthy auction game, but I found it to be pretty dry.  Not something I am likely to recommend over other similar games.

RATING: 8
A game of short duration that requires exact play combining king of the mountain interaction with poker style bidding in the auction phases.  This game improves in my estimation with every play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.75
The negative comments about this game are generally invalid or off-base.  If 16s and 17s are winning auctions, then you're not bidding smartly.  There is a real tension between buying lower value cards which are much cheaper, and going for a high value card which breaks ties.  Each of the techs are important and have to be managed, especially the timing of when you go for the top prvilages.  This is a very good game, and hugely under-rated IMO.  The vast majority of people I teach this too wind up purchasing.

I'm not very fond of auction/bidding games but this one almost takes the cake. Some 'racing' to the best tiles, some set collecting, some hand management - everything fits in its place. The theme is a bit dull but doesn't bother as long as you focus on the best strategy to win.

I like Augsburg. Maybe it's not the best game I have ever played but definitely one of the few auction games I simply like.

The bidding part is a normal one, but you have several cards from several characters, and you can use them for the character shown or the final one. Weird system for resolving the winner in case of a tie on the bid
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Starts out nicely, but ends up feeling unfinished and unbalanced.  Too much depends on the cards drawn.  Scoring is too "chunky" (i.e. not granulated).  Worst of all, the way that players can steal each other's tiles leaves too much to whimsy, and opens the door to tiresome cajoling and bickering.  This author's style (Augsburg, Chinatown, Lucky Loop) just doesn't align well with my taste in games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is tricky and different kind of auction game, where it's important to time what you do. The new mechanic that you must by certain buildings to pass certain number of prestige points is a good automatic bash-the-leader fucntion, as the first building cost more than the second etc. There is a trifle too much luck in what kind of card you draw, but the better cards cost more to get, it's reasonable balanced.

Four plays with four players. There is a constant stream of novel situations to which a lot of tactical thinking can be applied. The conflict of needing to acquire the status symbols of the coat-of-arms and letter of nobility as quickly as possible while at the same time holding back enough resources so that you won't be stymied by a lack of "stained glass" when the time comes creates a great deal of urgency and tension. Meanwhile the auctions are quick and interesting, and somehow they don't feel repetitious. The two negatives which bring my rating down are the shaky theme-to-mechanism relationship and the fact that there are rather a lot of small, easily forgotten rules. "Inelegant," I guess you might say.

It is a game of 35 auctions with a very pleasant auction system (bid a # of cards - highest card in hands of equal length wins.)

Augsburg 1520 had been on my list to 'find' and try for a while. A friend brought to a game night, so I was excited to try it. Others didn't enjoy it as much as I did, I really enjoyed figuring out with cards to keep and which auctions to try for. Others didn't like not being about to get the cards they needed. Even though I couldn't get the one I needed either (I was unable to increase income for the longest time), it made it exciting and made me have to fight that much harder. Rated a 7 after one play.

This game is really about if you are lucky enough to have drawn the 16 or 17 of a suit.  If you did, hooray, you're going to win in that suit!  Everyone else gets money, which is really useful to buy some more crappy cards that aren't going to win you anything.  I doubt I will play this game again, the point of it is lost on me I guess.

RATING: 6
A lightish auction game with a substantial luck-of-the-draw element. There's no catch up mechanism, so if you don't win an auction in the first round (and it's by no means guaranteed that you will), then you'll likely be chasing the game from then on. Similarly, you may need a church to progress, but you may not have the cards to win an auction that round, leaving VPs going begging. Don't believe the 45 minute playing time, unless you're only playing with 2, it can run to double that. Very much a game in the 'OK, nothing special' category.

P.S. Is it just me, or does the box art resemble Sid James and Kenneth Williams acting a scene from 'Carry On up the Fuggers'?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Not a bad auction game with a couple of twists. The system for bidding is interesting and the victory points caps add something to think about. Still, it lacked the excitement needed for me to really want to play more.

RATING: 6
Well, this is a very unusual game. It's really a card game somewhere between poker and Taj Mahal, where cards are so valuable you want to hang on to them, but if you don't spend them, they're worth nothing.  Timing is everything.  It's really important to get a quick start.

It's hard to really judge the game after one play because it is so different from other games I'd played.  More of a card game than a euro, and probably better when you know what you are doing. (1 play)

A very nice auction game using this mechanic to power a points gathering engine that follows three different paths (money in order to pay for auction point cards, nobility which gains victory points, status which gains additional auction point cards).  You need money to buy cards & churches/cathedrals, you need cards to win auctions.  If you don't buy a church, you can't go past 25 victory points, if you don't buy a cathedral, you can't go past 45 victory points.  Very simple process (limited number of turns) with strategic choices.

Played two games back to back. This seems like a good game boardering on a great game. However, the rules we had were abysmally written and I'm still not sure we were playing everything right. I played both games with two players and am still waiting to see if the game plays well with 4 or 5 players. If it does I'll probably bump the rating to an 8. Well, I played my first game with 4 players and the rating stays a 7. I was dealt a hand at the start with no cards higher than an 11 and was not able to take any tricks on the first round. One player took 3 of the 5 tricks and went on to win the game handily. Played a 5 player game, it's a good game, but the rating stays a 7.

Initial impression after one game. I actually liked many of the aspects of this game a lot, but the auction mechanism has driven down my first impression. In my first game I was dealt no "17" cards at all and basically felt unable to win any of the important auctions, despite having a huge handful of cards. I am of course willing to accept the possibility that some alternative strategy, independent of getting high-valued cards exists, but after my first game it eludes me and the game was somewhat spoiled by what felt like an excessive luck of the draw factor. Going through more than one turn without winning any auctions, but getting a lot of loose second- and third-place change was not terribly exciting.

Also, the mechanism where there aren't enough of the various upgrade tiles to go round, which forces players to steal existing ones from each other felt a bit too arbitrary to me. Again, with experience good rational arguments can probably be made why taking from one opponent is better than from another, but in our game the choice was often completely arbitrary (or based on personal grudges - even worse).

What seems to be an auction/economic game is to me much more about hand management.  It can be frustrating as you are so dependent on the cards you draw - and winning the right auction - or not - can seem so out of your control.  Yet, after a few playings I've increasingly seen how your hand management decisions - and ways of "not quite winning" key auctions can provide interesting tactics.

I didn't expect much from Augsburg 1520. Of the first four medium line alea games this has the lowest average, least ratings and least plays. So it was a pleasant surprise that there's a good game here that is on par with Louis XIV. At first glance they are completely different games with Augsburg being an auction game and Louis XIV an area control game. But both are similar in length and weight and in both games the challenge for the player is to build up small advantages by using their cards/resources a bit more efficient than the other players to earn privileges. 
Augsburg has a cool innovative auction mechanism and built in victory point barriers. While the barriers are a key element they might be too digital. Four out of five players were stuck at the last 45 VP barrier although we used different strategies. This leads to the final auctions being very important. Advantages gained earlier in the game can be rendered obsolete. Further games have to show if it is possible to prepare for success in the final auctions by using resources efficiently beforehand (my impression) or if it comes down to plain luck who succeeds there.
One other thing: The graphics of this game are terrible. Czarn√© must be the most overrated boardgame artist around.

I can see where some of the complaints come from for this game.  There is a large amount of luck in the cards that you draw (or, "debt certificates", as the rules refer to them).  Some players can go without winning several auctions in a row when they continually draw low/middle cards.  However, I feel that this evens itself out a little bit, as players can accumulate more cards and then come in later and dominate some auctions.  It also feels like the rich get richer quite easily.  Still, I like auction games, and this has an intriguing system.  I'm not a big fan of the poker-style bidding, but I like the way you have to spend money/points to make more money/points.

RATING: 5
A blind-bidding game about advancing 3 tracks - money, VPs, and cards. You use money to buy cards, and cards to win bids. In a 5-player game, one person misses out on an advancement (i.e. limited number to buy), and if it happens to be the VP advancement, then you're pretty much out of the game. 

In addition, the bidding system seemed to be extremely random. To win a bid, you need the most cards of 1 suit (extremely rare - it mostly comes down to ties). In the case of a tie, a tie-breaker on the card is used. And it seemed that almost every bid was won by the person with the 16 or 17 tie-breaker on the card. 

If you're unlucky enough to draw small cards in the start, all you can do is hold them and collect more of the suit. And in a game with limited items to buy, that can be devastating. 

So overall, I didn't think it was a particularly good bidding game. Games like Taj Mahal employ the card-bidding system much more elegantly and are more enjoyable to play.

Need to revisit this with 'correct' bidding (it's a shame the game can't cope with new players?!)

UPDATE: Replayed with a better idea of how to do well and crushed my opponents, it was an eye-opener on how far game design has moved on. It's not bad, but it's neither intuitive nor all that satisfying to work out.

This game just doesn't sit right with me.  It seems like losing an auction is just so devastating, and there is too much kingmaking with taking away other people's "powers".  I'm not sure I would want to try it again.

[i]Rating (removed) and above comment applies to the unintentional variant where we didn't play correctly[/i]:
1. Only the winning player in the auction has to pay the cards bid.
2. You can forfeit an action on the card for 2 Prestige points.
3. The +2 cards action requires you to discard one card.
4. When taking the highest level tile, you must return your 3rd level tile to the pool.
5. If you lose a tile to another player, you get a consolation of 100 guilders or 1 prestige point.
6. You cannot take the 300 guilders as the action if you are on the first level of the money track (don't think anyone attempted to do this).

Somehow I have been roped into teaching this game several times. I have always acquiesced even though it is quite flawed. I am not sure why I keep getting pulled back to it but I plan to avoid it from now on. The most important problem is that early auctions can create a runaway leader problem or at least force players who do not win sufficient favours in the first round into a very defensive and tight game that has little hope for success. The game is better for as few players as possible (as RaDiKal would say: optimal number=0). I find it marginally tolerable with two because it is fast and the raise-pass-call bidding system is much less frustrating. It should never be played with five as at least two people will likely not enjoy the experience as they can do little but watch the early leaders.

A mixed bag for me...
Good gameplay, enough good decisions to be made...
It was just lacking a "wow" factor and fun-factor.
I'd play again, but many of the other Alea's themselves hold up better than this offer...

Ug. The art is complete turn off to me. 19th century Baptist style church for a cathedral? Early 20th century gold coins for the money? I dislike this game more than any in my collection.

Very good auction/set-collection card game. Timing & money management is crucial, as there are two barriers on the victory point track (requiring a donation for a church and a dom). The poker-style of bidding is an original touch. Luck of the cards has an impact, although this is balanced by a higher cost for the better cards and the fact that you can also win an auction with a lot of the cheaper/lower cards. More enjoyable once you know the auction cards and the game mechanism (both auction and scoring).

Luck driven (=cards) auction game. Not an unique or different kind of, which is the biggest problem. What I mean is, that there are so many GOOD auction games available, so this one is not going to be big hit for me. I was expecting more.

Very Good game.  I like the auction mechanic and how you have to build your ability to auction.  I also like how each track needs to be built evenly.  It can have a bit of a runaway leader problem but there are mechanics availble to counter that.  I have yet to win, but I look forward to the next play.

Money gets you influence cards which allows you to bid.  It's mostly a blind-bidding game with a few limitations on trying to slow down a runaway leader (who ever manages to get upgrade their VP track early on).  It's also a card collecting game where those who have money will benefit more, so it can be frustrating in not getting enough/right cards you need to come from behind.  This was the major issue I also had with Louis XIV (same small-sized Alea game).  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Enjoyed my first play with 3 people.  The bidding mechanism involving first quantity and then quality is a different twist and adds some variety to an auction/bidding game.  The requirement to build a church to move past 25 points and then a cathedral to move past 45 points forces a change in strategy at times as well and perhaps serves as a bit of a catch-up mechanism for those who are behind.  However, thus far in my couple plays, there hasn't been an extremely close game yet.  Not sure how easy it is to catch up in this game?

An auction game with a bidding system annoyingly dependent on luck of the draw and a terrible "bash the leader" mechanic (resources are deliberately scarce and so you take them from the other players when you get them).

Whew!!  Understanding the rules at first seems to make more confusion that understanding.  But just get the first game under your belt and it is actually very easy to understand.  Playing it well however is another matter.  I very much enjoy the game.  It is a challenge to dowell, and there is some interesting issues to deal with- money, timing of church and cathedral building, using priveldges or increasing your steps in the three areas.  Wonderful auction game, deserves to be played many times.

A quick scan of the rules gave me the impression of just more of the usual: auctions, money, victory points and so on. Coupled with the strange premise of the game - all players are Jakob Fugger, but some more than others - my interest was rather low.
Discovering a tense and manylayered knifefight of a game was therefore even more of a pleasant surprise, and it even works well with just two players.
See my review.

I know there is no way I will ever get those two and a half hours of my life back.  Someone else summarized this game as being overly complicated poker, and I agree with that assessment.  My risk aversion makes this game a miserable exercise, not to mention the fact that poor card draws can make it impossible to do much of anything for turn after turn after turn.

I was in Augsburg in early 2017.  I like the city, and I learned a little about Jakob Fugger, so I ordered this from my hotel room whilst there.

The game is fine, but the connection to the theme is really pretty thin - which was a disappointment given my reason for buying the game.  Nothing bad to say about the play, but did not really excite my interest.

03/03/09 Played a five-player game, once. I generally like auction games. The scoreboard speed bumps were a novel twist. Not enough of the better tiles for everyone allows players to somewhat beat down the leader by stealing theirs. But not so much they can't recover. On the other hand the game took much longer (2:05) than I assumed it would. Of course it was the first time for all concerned. Most of the graphics for the cards and tiles work well. But a couple of the developer's choices (e.g. yellow print on orange tiles) were hard to read. It will be interesting to see how it plays with four or three.

Solid light - mid-weight auction game where players are vying to prove that they are the best Jakob Fugger a Jakob Fugger can be.  I like this game, it's quick and has some good decision-making.  I imagine that it could become fairly formulaic after repeat plays.  UPDATE: I've played with 3 & 5.  I much preferred the competition in a 5 player game but think 4 would probably be the sweet spot due to how long the game took.

After four plays, I've really had fun with this game.  Bias to the upside for me with further play, I suspect.  I like RA and Goa very, very much and I like a luck element to my strategy games.  After reading the rules I didn't think I would like it but after playing it I really loved it.  The balancing mechanisms are interesting and the need for a church and then a cathedral to advance beyond 25vps then 45vps is a very unique mechanism...the winner of our game wasted 16vp.  I wasted none but he still won, so it shows the power and momentum that a player can generate in this game.  I like that.....the player that had poor card draws early in the game and didn't win a single auction still ended up not getting last place as he won later in the game with the sheer number of low cards...very interesting mechanisms.  Want to play again real soon after which time I suspect I will be upgrading my rating.

Auction game simulating Germany in 1520. One is dealt a number of cards. The deck is composed of 4 suits representing the nobility, with values ranging from 1 to 17. There are also jokers in the deck. Each card has a cash value as well (lower cards cost less) and you have to pay for your cards. Use the cards to bid on nobility. In the case of a tie with the numbers of cards, the single highest card is a tiebreaker. The winner gets to choose his reward, by advancing along one of three tracks: 1) money, 2) VPs, or 3) cards. Play over a number of rounds. The games we have played have had a runaway leader. There is a mechanic where one has to pay money to advance past 25 VPs and 45 VPs to attempt to slow the leader. It's not a bad game, but the repetition of the bidding does make it kind of dry, and there is not a whole lot of tension in the play. There is also a mechanic where you have to pay for your cards, with the theory being that you have to pay for your higher value cards. I will play again, but it just doesn't grab me.

A late pre-production copy obtained at GoF 2006 - apparently there may still be some very minor changes but essentially a final-release version.

I like this one quite a bit, except that the tension doesn't feel like it truly increases over the course of the game - your choices in the first round are identical to those in the later rounds, for the most part.  But a solid design that forces some interesting decisions and features plenty of player interaction.  A game worthy of the alea name.

Decent auction game, where you want to proceed up all tech trees at once, but nothing really excites me to pull it out and explore further. I don't think auction mechanics can last on their own anymore. I think they're best when being a vital sub-plot which helps drive a more interesting and strategic main plot. Augsburg almost got there by having multiple currencies, but competing for VP tiles didn't have enough main plot to carry my interest.

I felt that the endgame was a  bit broken. If a player is incapable of purchasing a cathedral (entirely possible if they get beat to the proper cards) they can not score past 45 and all of their plays from then on are either worthless or kingmaking. I liked this game right up until realizing this.

RATING: 7
This is an auction-ish game where you're bidding cards that you randomly drew.  It's a little like Taj Mahal in that cards are only good for certain auctions, so you usually want to load up on a particular color to do well in that auction.  There's a bit of a take-that element in which tiles get passed back and forth, but since the tiles are so limited, this happens to everyone and doesn't feel particularly heinous.  What is really difficult in this game is getting the church/cathedral--you need to have the cash to buy it AND win an auction in the same turn, which isn't easy.  If you don't get both of them, though, you won't win.

First play with 4 and some things don't sit right with me. Firstly, I think this game is worth the time with no more than 3 players as the pile of debt certificates won't be reshuffled as often, giving your low value bids a chance to win in the next couple of rounds before the surrended high cards are recycled back into the draw pile. I may be wrong about this aspect but it feels unfair; as does the stealing of the "Peurto Rico" power tiles and being compensated 100 guilders which feels like  a "cheap shot" and a artificial catchup mechanic. As does the scoring track barriers at 25 prestige and 45, which sums up the whole feel of having to manage money to buy the certificates to bid for prestige which is dependent on things that cost money and round and round we go. Held some mechanical interest, but I didn't feel like I was Jakob Fugger (poker in the 16th C.?) and emotionally didn't engage me as it was too clinical.

Augsburg 1520 is a funny one, with some things I admire and some that disappointed. I really like the bidding system, where you can win by having more cards or by having higher values. It reminded me a bit of Taj Mahal. And the sharp edges in the scoring introduced by needing specific upgrades to go beyond 25 and 45 VP provide some good tension. But the engine underneath all that is a rather generic set of advancement tracks, some of which seem much stronger than others.

First of all, its boring. Second, there are so many better games in this genre - both in theme and mechanic that are light years better. Further, it seems flawed. There are artificial catch up mechanisms that penalize the better player in order to help the others to catch up. THis keeps the score artificially close but has nothing to do with the skill or luck of the players involved. Lastly, the card draw can have a siginificant impact. I would always rather get a 17 for high card then have to spend 5 little cards just to beat the other guy. Likely won't ever play again.

So far, have only played it 2-player with my wife, but i can already see its potential.  I know this will be better with more players...

Upon reading the rules, it sounded a bit like Pizarro & Co, but upon playing, it is not all that similar (and far superior).

A game that has a good deal of depth for its relative brevity (a la Louis XIV).

UPDATE:  Played it with 5, and LOVED IT!  I had a blast playing this game...I was utterly frustrated (in a good way) by the "race to see who could build a cathedral" toward the end of the game.  Very tense and enjoyable.

There are a lot of things going on here, and I liked the way they fit together.  The auction mechanism is interesting and I like the card distribution method as well (dealt X cards and then have to buy the ones you want to keep).  The rule to keep the leader in check (having to buy a building to allow a score to increase beyond a certain threshold) was interesting and sort of innovative.  

My beef with the game (and what kept it from a seven or eight rating) was that there were a lot of fiddly exceptions that made it hard to just pick up and run with -- the end of the instructions has sixteen special rules and notes.

Game where you are attempting to collect points by improving your 'influence' over nobles. Interesting bidding mechanic. There is very little, if any, balancing mechanism to allow last players to have a chance at the end. The player who makes the least errors, or the one who is best at maximizing his turns, will win. You can very easily, and very quickly, get out of the game with no chance to come back.

RATING: 8
Blind bidding, money management, and development in three key areas make a very balanced game with multiple ways to win. Pursuing just one strategy will result in losing because you will run out of money, hit a max victory point limit, or not gain VPs fast enough to contend.

The game has a very interesting bidding mechanic which essentially consists of two rounds. In the first round players commit to spending a certain number of cards if they win. Then all players who made that commitment secretly place cards and the player with the highest card wins - and spends the cards. Other players in the second round do not lose their stake but do get a small consolation. What it makes it interesting is the cards available to players change in number and likely type over the course of the game rounds so the dynamic of the auction is subtly shifting.
I am not sure it is a good game but I am always more foregiving of games which are different.

This is extremely bad.... good idea very badly executed. The game is made in a way that the snowball effect is exponential in favor of someone who gets lucky... so you got no card of this one, the other gets the bonus so next time turn they have more money to buy more card so they can win over you more easily.... so great!!! ... not! I havent been disapointed in a game that much in a loooooong time!

You bid cards in four suits, only being able to bid in the suit you're currently on. In a round you go through all four and a wild. Whoever starts makes a bid (1, 2, etc) and then all other players can then pass, call, or raise. The cards are number 1-17 in each suit, but the numbers only matter if two or more players tie for the win in an auction, normally whoever bid the most cards wins. The confusing thing for me was, when it was my turn, I would start at 2 or 3 and expect it to be bid up like normal, but then all players pass or call and I wasn't able to play all my cards for a win cause I can't raise my own bid. Normally in an auction other players have to bid higher, but here they can bid the same amount. Cause all the cards for the suit are unique, which means if the person with the 17 or 16 or something high can just stay in long enough to be involved in the flop, then he can win. Then theres the Goa-like track, which is what drives you to win a certain auction or not. I thought it was fun, but think that some of the auctions were going too cheap, while the wild auction was going for a little too much.

Finally played with the correct rule.. well I think we did anyway.. it played very well with 4, there are few interesting decision, and I quite like the auction system in this one.  If you want something you really need to bid like you want it.  I do think getting the early coat of arms and other bonus vp tile is very important, and timing of getting church and cathedral..  

The whole auction feels like Taj Mahal lite, which is a good thing in my book. quick game too.

Alea Medium Box Series #3
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a truly clever auction game.  There are a number of great choices here created from the constraints of the design.  The Church and Cathedral push this to a whole new level as you work to find ways to get yourself past those humps.  I found myself constantly pushed into delicious decisions throughout the game.  The greatest thing about the design is that it works well with three, which is tough to pull off in an auction game.

The end game is a little awkward as you basically play out what you have and hope that it works, at a certain point you can see clearly how you just cannot win so it feels strange to continue whole-heartedly. Still, if you pull off a few key wins at the last round and finagle your situation you may be able to do something with what you are given.  Even with this, the rest of the game is so compelling that it makes me feel like I should have been spending more time preparing for the end. 

It is weird to play one of Jacob Fugger's split personalities.  Who will succeed in taking over his body?  Why the player with the most Prestige Points...

UPDATE: The five player game is too bloated.  The downtime is high, there is too much of a dependence on the card draws (as opposed to the lovely balance in the three player game) and you can spend a significant chunk of time with no chance of winning auctions, and knowing it.  I don't want to drop the rating of the game because I really enjoy it with three, but with five players I give this a 5.

An auction paired with a tech tree. One branch increases the number of cards drawn at the end of a round; another advances income which players use to buy the drawn cards; the last advances a victory point engine. Essentially, players draw cards, buy them, and use the winnings to advance up the tech tree, ultimately aiming for victory points. The auction is clever. I like it. However, many of the spaces on the tech tree are obviously superior to others, and the tech tree itself feels as generic as the theme, which makes the game both less interesting and less fun than it might be otherwise. It's a $2 ham sandwich.

Auction games are right up my alley, so I enjoyed Augsburg and want to try it again.  I wish there was a little more you could do other than mainly going up and down the track, giving the game a slightly claustrophobic feel.

The first time I played this game, I played a variant (without myself and others knowing about it), and won the game.  This variant involved the losing players losing their cards played as well as the first place player.  Everyone involved considered the game very cutthroat and so I was surpised when the second group didn't think so.  However, I really liked the game.  The real game I played was very different including get 300 extra gold when upgrading on the gold track and getting 100 gold or taking a point when losing your upgrde to another player.  This game involved a completely different strategy.  I have to play it again to comment further but at this point I liked the "variant" slightly better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
An interesting game with an hilarious nonsense theme about a convention of Jakob Fugger impersonators. There are a whole lot more sharp edges than is typical for an alea game: the exclusivity of the final stages of the tracks, the declining values of the royal seal etc., and of course the nightmare that is timing the purchase of a church or cathedral. It's just [i]brutal[/i].

There is some luck to the card draw (how much?). Some comments here attest to a runaway leader problem which I do not think exists unless the other players allow it through early mistakes in the bidding.

I'd love a retheme.

Freebie from the 2009 Origins Board Room. Eight months later I finally ran into someone who knew the rules and was willing to teach them, and enjoyed the game. Still, I see a lot of luck involved in the cards you have a chance to buy; in just one game I was nearly shut out of two entire rounds because my cards were bad. I'll need to play it once or twice more to decide whether my current rating will hold.

Another fine auction game from Alea. This time you're rich businessmen "loaning" money to nobles, and instead of getting your money repaid back to you, you're offered certain "favors" (like, for instance, being Mayor). How cynical! Like every Alea game I've ever played, I got creamed in my first playing. Not quite enough elegance or "fun" factor to bring it up to an '8', but still worth playing.

Many things to like - the bidding mechanism, with the balancing of quantity vs value of cards, the little bonuses to make it worth your while bidding up and calling your opponents, the timing issues of the 5-auction sequence and the chances of taking & retaking certain tiles, the need to buy Church & Cathedral (but as late as possible to minimise the cost). Not convinced of the benefits of the Offices track.

Interesting game, but the mechanics of being able to steal upgrades from other players presents some "kingmaker" problems and didn't much appeal to me. The auction mechanics are fairly cool, though. The game also seems to have some runaway leader problems (somewhat connected to the kingmaker issues). In the end, I find it very unsatisfying to have the engine I've build torn down, which is at the very heart of this game ...

UPDATE: Rating raised to a 6 after a 4 player game. Yes there is a game here but it's not as much as I was hoping it would be. I'd like to give this one a couple more plays through and really see how it pans out after that. 

Rating of a 2 after a single play and it was a 2 player game. This game sucks as a 2 player game...sucks big time. In fact the box really should say that it supports it at all. I can't imagine 3 being much better. With 5 cards being awarded every turn and 2 actions from each, it's just ridiculous. I wouldn't usually be this harsh after one 2 player play but it annoys me they printed it. I see a good game here but 4 to 5 is where that will be.

I had originally overlooked this Alea release back when it came out because it looked like another unremarkable auction game, of which I already have too many. But I later became eager to give it a try because I noticed that it was #1 on my BoardGameGeek personalized recommendations page based on my over 600 game ratings. I figured the algorithm must have some good reasoning behind its recommendation so I sought out an opportunity to play it. Thankfully I played it before I bought it because I was right, it is just another unremarkable auction game. I really enjoy many pure auction games such as Ra, and many games with auctions in them such as Goa, Princes of Florence, Age of Steam, and Amun-Re, but its not a mechanic that particularly excites me so I'm not out there looking for more auction games to add to my collection unless they really strike me as original and fresh, and this one did not. It's certainly not that Augsburg was bad by any means, but it doesn't offer anything new that makes it compelling enough to purchase for me. Now that I've rated Augsburg (a 6 incidentally), BGG has removed it from my personalized recommendations, and the new #1 recommendation is Flaschenteufel. I wonder if I should trust the algorithm and seek out a chance to play this one.

With five, at least, the VP track is the only thing that matters, which makes the game disappointingly one-dimensional.  (And woe to anyone who doesn't realize this *immediately*.)

Yes, the theme is horribly boring, but for some reason it actually works for me, aside from that fact that each player is playing one of the split personalities of Old Man Fugger. I think all the parts of this game are interesting and really fit together nicely, giving a lot of meaningful choices in each segment, from which cards to buy, how many to bid, which to play, and how many favors to take. The buildings as score limiters and also tie breakers are also quite fab. The end of the game was a little odd, but perhaps we were unprepared for it.

The 3 player game is good, but unfortunately the 5 player game is too long and random.

Nice alea-gem. As others indicated before, (un)lucky card draw in the first rounds may weigh too heavy on the further development. In the endgame, players may be unable to score in the final round only because they do not win any auction in the last round and cannot build a dome. Otherwise, the game has its various mechanics working very well together, has close interaction, pretty high tension and great fun. Recommended!

I likey... I have a feeling that this game will soon supplant RA as my favorite auction drive game.

Its an 8 right now but could go up very easily with more plays.

You're bidding less often based on what you're getting, because the prizes are all so similar,  but more on what you think it's costing you- trying to win with low value cards, etc.  this makes it feel more like a trick taking game than an auction game.  also, someone in the lead can steamroll a bit with the advantage (despite the negative feedback loop),  which makes the first couple of turns the most important usually.  ok for a couple of plays.

(after 1 5p play)  Enjoyable auction game.  Timing was key with the 25 and 45 point caps unless you had a church/cathedral.   Game went a little longer than expected with 5 players.  We also shuffled through the deck more frequently with 5 which made 16's less valuable if you'd already seen the 17 played.

I thought the game was overly long for what it had to offer, and I didn't like the endlessly repetitive oneupmanship dynamic created by being able to take another player's building, which is one of the central mechanics of the game. Both philosophically and as a puzzle it didn't do anything for me.

RATING: 5
I want to be generous with my rating, since I was impressed with the mechanisms, and how they interacted.  Unfortunately, though, I think too much was dictated in the card draw, both in the order in which the selection cards came out, and the cards that players received through the standard draw.  If there's only one good selection card in the initial draw, and you don't have any good red cards (or worse, any red cards at all), then you don't stand a chance of getting it.  The way that cards are dealt out and paid for is nice, but I think cards would need to rotate through the deck more quickly (as in San Juan) to really make up for the randomness of the draw deck.  Still, the VP cap levels, and the prices of the cards on the back of the cards, was interesting.  I'd play it again, just to see how it holds up over multiple plays, but it doesn't really impress me all that much.

One of those good solid 7 Euro games.  Not much new in the way of mechanics but good game play.

Well, I'm not quite sure what to make of this one.  The rules are relatively difficult to make out (I read all the rules for everything, and this one required about three reads before I understood quite what was going on).  It plays a lot more enjoyably than it appears from the rules.  My biggest question on this one is the endgame.  The last one or two turns (on a four player game) seemed a bit anti-climactic.  Everyone more or less felt like they'd done just about everything they could do that mattered, except for stealing the 12 victory point role from other people.  Near the end, money and cards are virtually meaningless, so worrying about the trade and office roles was pointless (if you hadn't built your church/cathedral by then, you were long since out of the game).  I think this one will likely go down 1/2 a point or so on future plays because of the lackluster endgame.

Almost simple bidding game, somehow original, just a bit too dry.

I don't really like the knocking down of progress too much, and while the theme is cleverly implemented it still leads to a somewhat dry game with not quite enough to do. A very clean, elegant design.

interesting theme and system. but it seems not enough different way to win.it looks strict way to win and only metters is you can do or not. 
and it has little bit strange theme, there're 5 Jakob Fugger competing each other. :P

I like the card use to win the auctions as well as the buying of the cards. Solid game.

Played several times (with 4 and 5 players). The more I play this, the more I enjoy it. The whole game is very tense: even if the church and cathedral are critical points of the players' development, all the auctions matter. My main concerns are with the end game, which might suffer from king-making.

Never opened.  Prefer trades in SW Ohio area, just to avoid needing to ship, I can probably come to you.

If you like auction games that could be the right choice, but I do not really like.
It can happen that the last round is just boring and you have no benefit from auctions you have won!!!

I'm of two minds on Augsburg.   I love the gameplay.  It's an excellent auction system. 

But the components suck.  The tiles all look alike, and it's impossible to tell the columns apart thematically.

If Augsburg were rethemed and actually had some money invested in production, I suspect it would be a much more successful game.

I rather enjoy this game.  It's possible to walk away from it with a bad first impression if its odd mechanisms strike you wrong; however, I like them - they really lend an unusual feel to the game.

Only one playing, but feels okay. On the first playing it was a bit hard to see some obvious strategies and much was learnt the hard way. Will have to play more, for sure!

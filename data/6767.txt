RATING: 8.5
Kinetics that gain damage factors by shooter velocity.  Lasers that punch small, deep holes instead of wide swaths.  The ability to use cunning maneuver and rotation to disperse damage across your ship as it is taken.  The first time you core an opponent, then get to giddily continue compounding the damage through the rest of his ship, you will be hooked, just for the fact that things shred in vacuum correctly.  And that isn't even mentioning the physics of maneuver...

Rating is tentative after a few solo plays but this is looking like an awesome hardcore 3D strategy game.
Star Fleet Battles fell flat for me but this feels about right.

Love, love, love the hard science and realistic physics!  You really need to know when to turn those thrusters off or you can end up flying off the map.

REVIEW OF ATTACK VECTOR: TACTICAL. Attack Vector: Tactical is, basically, the most intricate and scientifically accurate spacecraft combat simulation available today. If you%u2019re interested in the ultimate in realistic space combat as can be extrapolated from current scientific knowledge and technological possibilities and you%u2019re willing to put a lot of effort into it, then it%u2019s the game for you. AVT is, as the name implies, a tactical game with some strategic elements. Most of the strategy can be ignored if you wish to focus on the tactical elements, but it does little good to win a battle if afterwards you have too little fuel or life support to reach home. The game is quite detailed and requires the tracking of large amounts of information, fortunately the designers have added several things that make it easier for most gamers to get thru the process. The first are the detailed ship control cards, called AVIDs, that allow you to track your ship%u2019s orientation and vectors in 3 dimensions.  The AVID is, frankly, one of the best designed game aids I%u2019ve ever seen.The second is the detailed and comprehensive training missions, which use a combination of step by step instructions and Pavlovian conditioning to help players grasp the basics of ship orientation, rotation and movement vectors. Yes, I said Pavlovian conditioning. In the training scenarios you use chocolate candy (Though  you can substitute some other form of treat. I used cherry lifesavers.) as a reward mechanism. You place the chocolates at various locations on the map, and when you learn the basics of movement and shooting you get rewarded for successfully completing training tasks by being allowed to eat the chocolates you move over or shoot.One piece of advice I might give to someone going thru the tutorials, as I did, is to use one of the box miniatures and the tilt blocks provided to help you grasp the idea of ship rotation and tilt as you learn to diagram such details on the AVID, it helped me a little in getting the 3d aspect down.AVT has some other good points, like the fact it makes realistic use of nuclear weapons instead of, like so many SF wargames, assuming that everyone either forgot how to build nukes once they had space travel, or adhere to some covenant banning their use. As for the downside, this is basically the %u201CPhoenix command%u201D of space combat systems. Phoenix Command was an incredibly detailed and realistic roleplaying game system with an emphasis on personal combat, and while it was hailed for it%u2019s groundbreaking realism, it failed in the end due to the sheer complexity and difficulty of the system. Still, the game has an appeal to it, and anyone who can master it has earned his %u201Chardcore gamer%u201D badge. Also, the game maintains a fair sense of humor, as evidenced in the ramming rules. I give it another good point for having the courage to lay out a future history that proposes a realistic, though unpopular, resolution to some of the major problems facing the real world today. To give further credit where it%u2019s due, I must say that Ad Astra games has excellent customer service, and replaced some misprinted books I got in my copy of AVT promptly and courteously. All in all, I%u2019d recommend AVT to those who like real, hard science in their science fiction, and the game could possibly serve as a valuable writing aid to someone who wants to write spacecraft combat oriented science fiction.

I recently played a game with a buddy of mine at a local Games shop and I gotta say it is outstanding. It's really easy to pick up the basics of movement and thinking in 3D in so far as plotting where your enemy is at on the AVID. Everything you need to figure out the numbers for target distance, angle, etc...etc...are all provided and very easy to read. The game plays very quickly once you get into it, me and my buddy were playing a very simplified game focusing primarily on getting movement and target sighting down, but I don't imagine it will take much longer per turn once you add in all the other things that are supposed to be there. Definately a must have for anyone wanting a truly realistic space combat experience.

The game I wish existed when I was a student. Then I was running in the right crowd for it, and had the time to play; if I found (or founded) a regular group this would probably shoot up a point or two. Elegant 3-D on the tabletop, realistic physics, and still some game in there.

RATING: 7
There is a bit of a learning curve right at the start, but once that hump has been surmounted, the wipe-off tactical display cards and stacked altitude and attitude indicators are straightforward and easy to use. The print on some of the play aids is a bit small, in particular the distance plotting look-up table and the fuel indicators near the bottom of the ship status sheets. But plotting accelerations, movements and firing vectors is not hard at all, no more difficult than the comparable 2D game (Triplanetary) and far easier than some that use a similar 3D space (StarForce: Alpha Centauri). I've only played using beam weapons, but adding projectile weapons, gravity wells and other hazards should be only a minor stretch.

I initially rated AV:T an 8 based on several plays using the tutorial and some basic setups mostly consisting of manuevering a couple of ships around and doing some simple combat with beam weapons.  I stand by my initial assessment that game is a staggeringly well-designed simulation of "realistic" space combat and I think that making this much science accessible is truly an admirable, respectable endeavor.  However, beyond the basic mechanics lies an almost impenetrable, terminally unfun exercise- its one thing for a game to be a simulation when it's exciting, but it's another when firing a missile salvo means resolving a _worksheet_ to see if anything hits.   Bluntly put, AV:T as a complete system is much more work than fun, which is very unfortunate because the concepts are solid and the idea is pretty much unprecedented.  I think if anything, AV:T proves that space combat with all of the romantic elements removed- no matter how preposterous and unrealistic they may be- is ultimately cold, boring, and empty, much like the white (?) hexmaps the game contains.  I'd much rather play an hour long complete game of Federation Commander, with all its impossible, nonsensical physics than spend 20 minutes working out a single firing solution in AV:T.  The difference is fun- FedCom is _fun_.  I play games to have fun.  A simple equation reveals that if FedCom=Fun and AV:T=Work, I'll choose FedCom.  One of the sharpest about-faces I've ever had in an opinion concerning a game.  That being said, I do think that there is definitely an audience for this kind of thing, so if you're at MIT or have a dot-matrix printout of all the technical inaccuracies in "The Hunt for Red October", then have at it.

I had an opportunity to learn this game at BGG con. There is some truth to the games claim that we do the math so you can have the fun. But its a bit like we provide the shovel so you can clean up the dung. Well I exagerate a bit. The game is really very interesting and I was impressed with the true ease at which you can do the 3D tactical combat. However we started the demo with 6 players and 5 left at the break. I was the only one who stayed to the finish. This game would rate a 8 out of 10 for complexity. Someone compared it to Die Macher but its far more complex than that. It not as complex as Star Fleet battles or Squad Leader but you are doing 3D newtonian vector physics. This will take a dedicated effort to learn.

Traded Axis & Allies Pacific and Amazonas for Attack Vector Tactical and Hunting Party.

Well...it is what it says it is.  A Realisitic space combat simulator.  The problem is that...well...realistic space combat is kinda boring.  And full of lots of math (though granted they try to hide all the math as much as possible and do a fairly good job of it).

You are going to spend X time flying at each other, exchange a bunch of shots and maybe have some interesting maneuvering as you pass, then spend 3X time trying to position and adjust your vectors so you can fight again.  That part is boring.  Really boring.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not a bad game, just a bit too cumbersome for my tastes.

Plus, the whole bit about "realistic" physics cracks me up. Apparently fantastical weapons are no problemo, but we're still stuck with thrust-based engines that somehow propelled insanely expensive capital warships to other solar systems that are light years away for the sole purpose of fighting other ships. Yeah, ok.

Basically, the premise itself is crap, and IMO the 3D element doesn't really add anything meaningful to the gameplay since you rotate and/or point your weapons at each other at all times, which effectively means you're always fighting on a 2D plane relative to one another anyway.

I have a great time playing this, even if I do tend to fumble my ship through all three dimensions.  The game IS playable 3D starship combat, but expect your first games to take about 4 hours, and you'll probably dedicated multiple play sessions to learning the game.  Familiarity with the game rules and tactics will speed play, but I don't have a sense for how much yet.  No complex math.

I wish I could split my rating on this game.  The movement engine and detail behind this game is phenomenal.  But the weapon system (especially missile tracking) is a real chore, and not well explained in the rules. I didn't really get it until I played a game with the designer.

But for those who are looking for an unbelievable clever and realistic take on 3-D space combat, you must try this game.  It is a tour-de-force.

As noted in a bunch of other comments, bookkeeping can be on the overwhelming side for some. And also as noted in other reviews, the complexity of gameplay is staggering, and it's been put into a coherent and manageable system. I would rank it higher, but after two separate plays I still wouldn't be able to sit down and remember how to play. I guess I would rather sacrifice the 3D movement and play Federation Commander where you can play a scenario almost as fast as it takes you to engage in AV:T. I have no doubts I'll play the game again, and will end up owning it someday  ...but not today.

This game seems to have everything I wanted in a 3D space combat game... except playability.  Oh, the designer/developer has done a remarkable job streamlining the game, but I still feel more like the navigational and targetting computer rather than the captain.  It's doubtful any of my friends would agree to a casual game.  Maybe if it was implemented as a computer game...

RATING: N/A
I really can't rate this game yet, because I have not had a chance to play other than solo.  This game is complex, but it is *not* a rules related complexity; it is execution related complexity.  In other words, the rules are not hard to grasp, but the execution, or what I would call mental rendering, of each step is very complex.  Much like Kahn!!, it is hard for my mind to break out of the traditional 2D plane.  

The play aids are fantastic and make the game possible.  Ken Burnside et al have clearly worked very hard to make this game special, and their dedication shows.  Contrary to what some have said, you do *not* need to be a physicist or engineer to play; you just need to devote some time to the system.  Unfortunately, what little time I have has to be spent elsewhere.

RATING: 3
cool design, cool background.

however, the potential for interesting tactics has not been realized in the games I have played so far.  the concepts are so difficult for most people to get through that they are not interested in trying again, and they limit movement and seeking weapons fire to avoid the mental overhead they require.

unlike air combat, I am not sure there is a big payoff in playing in 3D for space combat.  going 'up' or 'down' in space has no real tactical benefit, other than making things difficult to visualize (the minis don't match the 2D map scale, and the height scale doesn't match the 2D scale).

in air combat, altitude has major impact (e.g. engine power changes, drag changes, turning with/against gravity, loss/gain of speed with climb/dive, etc.).  in space, you can call any vector 'up' with no affect on gameplay.

particular to attack vector, the seeking weapon complexity is overdone and a number of the ships have glaring design problems (e.g. a Wasp needs to keep it's nose pointed at the enemy, but will always lose 25-50% of it's firepower with any damage through the nose).

I've worked through the tutorials but have yet to find/create an opponent. This is simply an amazing game. Cards on the table, I'm a physicist, but you can taste the hard science without actually seeing it a lot of it. If you want to know how space combat will _really_ be (as opposed to the "fighter planes and ships in space" nonsense from most popular SF) then all the complexity is worth it IMHO.

I'll rate it as soon as I've played another person or two.

A very difficult game to rate.  The components and the amount of background in the books rates a 10, but the complexity and trying to get a gaming group to try this rates a 5, so I went halfway.  It is a clever 3D system that presents a realistic view of what space combat will probably be over the next hundred years or so, but it can be questioned whether or not it is fun.  I found the system interesting, well designed, and unusual(in a good way), but if you're into blowing things up in space with a lot of ships on the board then you will need to look elsewhere.

This is an excellent simulation of what I suspect space combat could be in the future.  It is still a game as the real (extrapolated) tactics and strategies involved in a real space war would probably preclude any tactical decision making whatsoever.  All that aside, this game would be very fun for anybody interested in war games and space flight, or somebody interested in physics.  It is NOT for anybody looking for a cinematic approach to space combat a la Star Wars.

Fun, fascinating, stimulating -- but it's definitely not everyone's cup of tea. The play aids are scary and unfamilair. You have to do a bit of math (mind you, not any worse than Euro-game VP bean counting!). There are a lot of moving parts - power, heat, weapon cycle times, ammunition, fuel, and more. Movement is unforgivingly Newtonian and three-dimensional. But once you have slammed into that cliff-shipped learning curve and climbed up it...

Hard game to rate. I initially gave this game a 7 based on reading the rules (would have been higher if not for the pretentious rubbish that passes for 'realism') and solo play. However it only took a couple of sessions of play between two people to realise that the game has no real tactical depth underneath the complexity. The way the numbers are set it boils down to point your nose at the enemy and keep shooting until somebody blows up. Really that is a pity, a lot of clever work went into the mechanics and somebody kind of forgot to put a game underneath.

So far, I only have one play of this under my belt.  I *want* this to be a 10, but the complexity is tough.  I think that if I get more plays in, it will go up in rank, but the initial complexity is intimidating to new players.  It has to be admitted though, it does a great job of taking a very very complex concept, and reducing it to a moderately complex game, without losing any simulation detail.

The ultimate evolution of conceiving of and fighting with space ships as kids. The ballistic weapon mechanics are scary to describe, but beautiful in play.

Sadly, I have to play it (or play with it) solitaire, as it's a big commitment to learn, and it takes a rare kind of person to be drawn in far enough. I finally wound up selling it (for a steal), but I remain eager to see how version 2 turns out and to play again in the future.

RATING: 10
The play aids do an excellent job of making what should be a math nightmare into a playable game.  Yes, there is a good deal of recordkeeping, but that's the price paid for this level of detail.  What that buys you is a tactical combat simulation that makes a one-on-one ship duel an interesting tactical excercise.  The only drawback is that it is difficult to run more than one ship each (at least with the little practice I've been able to get).  Excellent for large games (one person to a ship) but difficult to run a larger engagement with only two people.  Given the eventual fleet version, I don't see this as much of a drawback.

RATING: 8.5
Playable, enjoyable and interesting - no mean feat given the complexity of the subject. Learning to play the game means learning a group of procedures, simple individually but collectively providing tactical depth. Thus you move from game mechanics to tactics (the fun stuff) without much delay. Given that the focus of the game is on duels, the level of detail seems right. There's a good deal of book-keeping, but most of the time it goes by in little dribs and drabs and isn't really onerous. For multiship battles it seems much better to have 1 player per ship. I find the "Ten Worlds" backstory compelling. (Full disclosure: I've volunteered to demo this game at cons, so I'm affiliated with the publisher, albeit loosely.)

Being a sci-fi fanatic myself, this game is awesome.  I relate it to being in the captain's chair during a star trek episode.  Fantastic.  The rule book is also a great read.  It is interesting to see how Ken and his team integrated real science for this game.

Great movement, beam weapon, and damage system.  Kinetics need to be reworked to be faster, easier, and more fun to use.  Good kinetics would make this a 10 for me.

Simply awesome fully 3D ship positioning, targeting, and vector movement! Once you get accustomed to the AVID (a neat laminated work-tool for recording ship orientation, movement and targeting information) the game basics are fairly easy. 

It looks more complicated than it really is. AVID familiarity and beam weapons will get players gaming rapidly. The coilguns and missles add complexity, so avoid those at first. Comes with a nice hands-on walkthrough to teach these basics!

If you're looking for "space combat done right" with "no scary math" - this is THE game!

Excellent ideas here, extremely well done for what it is.  A bit too much bookkeeping in my opinion.  The 1.5 rules are a big step up from 1.0, though.

Genius bit of tag. Shooting at each of is so difficult unless you all agree to head to the middle and shoot.

This is very difficult to rate according to BGG guidelines.  I really, really enjoy this game.  The mechanics and execution blow me away, and it's a lot of fun trying to get everything figured out as you try to fly your ship, locate your target, plan your attack, and calculate how to make that happen, while attempting to evade all the incoming missles and other nasties heading your way.

The game mechanics are brilliant.  While they're full of detail, they still are hiding a LOT of math and physics that you don't need to worry about, since the rules already incorporate them.

All that said, this is NOT the game to suggest on a light game night.  I'd love to play this a lot more often, but the right opportunities to do so don't come up that much for me.

So I'd rate it a 9 or more for my enjoyment and appreciation of it, and a 7 or less for the difficulty of getting it to the table, and bringing others up to speed on how to play it, and I'll average that out to an 8 for my rating.

The game does just what it claims:  it is a fun, playable, 3-d, Newtonian, vector movement, hard science space combat game.  The play aids make the game run smoothly and quickly while taking care of maintaining the realism.  I'm looking forward to playing some 2 on 2.

Quite possibly one of the best games I've ever played. The use of play aids and concept design set the standard for how an in-depth game -should- be. Lots of detail and room to be sneaky and creative, but presented in such a way to be playable.

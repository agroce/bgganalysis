One gaming session played... forever discarded to the sell/sold pile!
The game plays okay; but falls flat on it's face even with the card design...
The useful things you need to know about the characters are so small compared to the card (very nice) art and ('fancy schmancy') character names, that any pleasure and subtlety of game play is lost.
Certain elements of the game don't even come into play until too late... and it's too easy to win simply by selecting/recruiting the least costly character.
Definitely NOT a party game... despite it being marketed as such.  
A real shame as the game has promise, but the fundamentals of card design appear to simply have been forgetten or laid aside in leiu of fancy art.

This a light and very playable - card drafting game.  Players will draft 1 of 2 different cards.  Guest cards will have interests that if matched to other guests in groups score you points.  Belle cards allow the rules to be mixed up.  The drafting mechanic uses a pass-over feature in that others gain a benefit if they take that card in later rounds.  This is a nice mechanic for drafting the card you want vs. the one that is 'free'/ next.  Overall, the gameplay is light and flows smoothly.  The game is nicely illustrated and the card quality is top notch.  Game play can suffer a tad if not enough Belle cards are in play and "messin' with things".  In this regard the base game falls short, but the advance game starts players with these in hand and thus ensures that the cards are available to mess with the game (in a good way).  overall, a solid game.  Its good filler material and nicely made.  Not overly in-depth, but certainly tactical enough to make it interesting enough for repeat plays.

Was not expecting to enjoy this for the theme, but the GF wanted it and so I learned the rules. It's actually pretty neat, the art and character names are colorful and fun, and the mechanics are really interesting, scoring groups of guests at the Ball based on shared interests, and then having all manner of modifiers to different groups, and cards you can use to harass one another. Really recommend using the Advanced game with the County cards and Grifters for added strategy and scoring options. Another unique Dice Hate Me game, worth checking out, don't be put off by the title.

Totally underwhelmed with this (although to be fair we didn't play the advanced version, so maybe there's more using that ... No incentive to try it again)

Draft with closed economy (that I suspect will break if someone just refuses to spend rejections) couldn't see why you'd bother to take the belle cards in a multi-player game just taking a guest seems better. 

Turn order seems an issue too, game is unlikely to run an even number for everyone, so going earlier is just better.

Saying all that for a quick filler I'd forgive it - looks pretty (although there's too much text on the belle cards) if it was fun. But it wasn't, decisions were obvious, theme is thin and I couldn't wait for it to end.

Shame ...

Yet another cute, light card game that is ultimately forgettable. The art is really stunning — it looks like it was drawn by a Disney animator — and I appreciate that the theme is a less stereotypical "guy's" theme. I did not like the take-that cards at all, though, especially the ones that allowed you to steal cards. It turned the childish whimsy of the theme into resentful annoyance. Why do card game designers still insist on having these annoying attack mechanics in their games? Brought to Goodwill.

Pretty weak set collection game, where cards are drafted from a queue similar to Small World.   There is a parallel queue of "take that cards" which are essential to spice the game up, but also allow for point calculation and king making in a game that doesn't need either.   The best thing was the funny names, but that's the kind of thing that is only funny the first time through.

[b][FirstImpressionOn5thDEC2014][/b] This is a light set collection game. The game feels very automated with a few choices. I only gathered person cards throughout my play rather than claiming the ability cards to help or deny players. 

The game tries to add complexity to the game by having the ability cards, but I still think it doesn't do much. The base game is too simple so playing with the expansions/variants are probably the best way to play the game.

This game is pretty fantastic. I've played it simplified (no Belle cards) and had fun with pre-literate children. I've played it with 30-year-old men. Everyone has fun.

The game's alignment of theme with exclusive parties and regrets and line-jumping is tons of fun.

In my experience thus far, there is a lot of variance in the power level of different Belle cards, so the game can be pretty swingy because of it.

This game has a very poor title. The title will immediately turn off serious gamers, because it seems to be made for little girls. 

Instead, this game has grown-up strategy and backstabbing that can only come from great gamers. I really like this game. You collect people into 3 groups by finding things they have in common. The more things in common the people in the group have, the more points you get when the group is full. But beware- your opponents can play cards that take away your points! 

Great graphics, funny character names and strategy that changes based on what your opponents are doing make this game great!

Trying to suspend judgment, since I played a PnP version missing some of the extra frills of the published version, but this seemed really dry and not fun. All symbols have exactly the same distribution; there's nothing to distinguish an interest in books from an interest in bananas. (Or whatever.)

Redeeming factors: Jacqui Davis' beautiful and varied character art, and the ridiculous names.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I don't mind the theme, but a game of this lightness and theme needs to have the mechanics deeply intertwined in the theme(IMO).  I was hoping to be gain influence and resources in order to be the Belle of the ball, but I ended up just drafting cards for set collection. . . .

On the good side, no one had to ask what any of the cards did- the wording was great.  On the other hand I had major problems with the way the game ends.  It was clunky, encouraged card counting/AP/annoyance and un-thematic.

Belle of the Ball used the Heartland Hauling Co. trick of cards becoming a score track. In Heartland Hauling, each player had 2 and they also acted as your storage. In BotB, there were 3, and they were only used for a score track, so it seemed stretched a bit thin. I can appreciate it from their side, it's cheaper/easier to print 3 cards than add a different component for a score track, but I wasn't crazy about it.

Belle of the Ball has several different types of action cards; instant, prolonged, and attack. We read through the attack cards and took them out. 

I had seen a comment from someone that they didn't care for this with 2, and it probably would be more interesting with more - the action cards would be more likely to score more points. I had a card that said, "Get 1 point when another player plays a Regret". If Sam didn't play a regret, I was out of luck. Also, with 2 people's turns in between mine, the cards would be active for more turns (1 round = 3 turns versus 2).

* Kickstarted! *

Choose either a guest for your party or a card that can affect a party next turn — with points awarded for the shared interests in each quartet of guests. It's a simple mechanic with a lot of strategy because you want to prevent opponents from getting points just as much as you want to accumulate them. As an added bonus, the characters' names are ridiculous fun for the kids. The advanced options make the game even more challenging too.

PLUS: easy to learn, strategy required
MINUS: entices one or two plays - not a main game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.2
I feel like there is a really good game here, I just don't really enjoy it so much as the game has been presented in this package.  The way scoring works and the ability to choose from guests is interesting and works well.  I can't see much reason for the Belle cards as picking them up means not choosing a guest, and guests are so important.  I'd like to try out some variations my group discussed such as mixing all of the cards and having one line instead of two.  Again, a great basis for a game, however for us, it just didn't quite work out for us.

As a game, its far too simplistic for my tastes, but as a family game for me, my wife, and my 2 young daughters (ages 7 and 8)?  This is darn near perfect.  In that sense, BotB would get a 10 for the enjoyment it has brought to me and my girls for a few nights. 

Has small expansions included.  Belle's Favor, and advanced variants.

"Okay, so you're a Renaissance merchant--"
"Nope, next."
"Take up your sword and shield because--"
"Ugh, pass."
"There are zomb--"
"NO."
"You have to throw the best party and anticipate the whims of the Belle."
"I'm listening..."

Yes, this is the sort of thing I like. A novel yet completely normal theme, lots of flavor, and a fun narrative that emerges. Much more of a game than the similarly-shelved Marrying Mr. Darcy (which I also like), this is a fun, silly game that is a delight. Will you put aside your pride and invite a dude named Satisfied Stainplop to your party? This is one of the tense situations you will find yourself in with Belle of the Ball.

An interesting card drafting game where you are building small groups of partygoers and matching them based on their discussion interests.  You also have Belle cards which can be a take that card, cards that help you, or cards that can benefit you and others.  It has ok artwork and a relatively solid design.  I don't know if the cards ought to be in one line as Tom Vasel suggest in his review, but it is a different theme.  Not the best game but not terrible.

A simple symbol matching, set-collecting game. The points for a meld are pretty even (most in the 7-9 range, by the looks of it); that makes the belle cards largely superfluous, because you're a turn behind in making a meld when you take one; and it's very unlikely that you'll win if you have fewer melds than the opponents.

I like the art style and the fast pace of this game, But I'm afraid there is just no control. Power cards dealt out at the beginning of the game are not balanced, and I strongly suggest using tokens as letters instead of random guest cards, since it seems one person can lose a lot of points before the game even begins just by luck of the draw. This will result in a longer play time, but the game is fast enough that the fix is worth it.

I wish the game had a better way to encourage players to take/use the action cards. If the starting line-up is junk, the game drags while players only take guest cards.

Overall, definitely not a perfect game. A few house-rules can clear up these issues, but I wish more foresight had gone into the mechanics.

15-02-2015. Rated after 1 play. Belle of the Ball is a fun set collection game, centered around organizing parties. The artwork is beautiful, but whimsical. 

In Belle of the Ball, you invite guests to a party. Each guest likes 3 topics to talk about and can typically fit in a party of 4 different people. You get VPs for making sets of matched visitor interests (sets).  Besides visitors, you can also get Belle cards. These are special cards that give you a benefit or screws a little with your buddy.

Each round you may play a Belle card, invite a card from the central offer of 5 cards. This works with a Smallworld mechanism, you have 'regrets' that you can spend to take up cards higher up in the offer. If you take one of the cards with an regret card you get it and can use it in subsequent turns.

Belle of the Ball is light, but whimsically fun game. I think the theme is good and works for the game. The artwork is fantastic (Jacqui Davis) and makes the game feel more interesting than the mechanisms really are.

It's a very simple, lightweight card game with advanced rules that may add a bit more depth.  The theme doesn't necessarily pop out very strongly but, then again, how many card games really have themes that do?  Ultimately, it's a filler game that might have some of the more AP prone players over-thinking a bit but I am quite fond of the art and silly names.

Nice light little filler with an unusual theme. seems like there should be a better way of getting the 'Belle' cards, as choosing between one of them and the party guests is usually a no-brainer. have yet to try the variant where you mix all the cards into one big deck though, so that might work better.

I was pretty underwhelmed with this one. It seemed like it would be a quick and clever tableau building game. It was alright for a turn or two, but I couldn't help but feel like I was just playing a grade school matching game with the  card symbols. There were a few interesting gotcha cards, but seeming as they were public knowledge when gained it was pretty much impossible not to telegraph exactly what you were going to be doing with them. To be fair, that might be less of an issue with a higher player count, but I still don't think my opinion will change all that much.

A wonderfully thematic [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/tag/set_collection/user/Vroenis]set collection[/url] game in which the sets you're collecting are people attending your parties.

Medium-high theme application.

Wonderful art and hilarious character names, it's light but fun without being complicated.

I backed this KS just so that I could get the Great heartland Hauling Company. Since then I gave Belle away. That said, I think the game is fine and the artwork is great.

This has way too much of "Oh, you look like you're doing well. Well, not anymore!" Even for its length. I really dislike games that easily devolve into "who can screw everyone else the best?"

It's actually a fairly tactical game when playing the full variants.  My kids enjoy it, and allows for a fairly "thinky" game in a small package, particularity for kids.  Yet, the decisions are not too deep or broad to discourage play from young players.

To much take that and not enough anything else. Cute card art and names.

Fun game albeit a bit simple.  Would like to have seen more cards and more combinations of Belle effects.

I printed the kickstarter P&P file for this to play a little before becoming a backer.  Unfortunately its really too light to add to my collection despite the little girl friendly theme so I'll be sticking with some other fillers.

This was actually a pretty cool light card game except for the Mischief Belles.  Those targeted attack cards were ridiculously weak and more or less randomly assigned.  The game would improve by a good point or two without them.

I sometimes like games just because of the art.  And because my daughter will go bananas.  THERE'S A PRINCESS!

RATING: 5.5
At long last: a game by the Brands that I didn't like! There is a great deal in Rajas that I actually do like; but
1) the overly busy board,
2) the fiddly rules system,
3) the lack of a catch-up mechanism, and
4) the lack of a way (even an expensive way) of mitigating die-rolls in a significant manner
makes the game a disappointment....unless you like Feld games: it definitely feels far more Feldian than Brandian, which coming from me is a bad thing.

And a warning: if you suffer from blue-green colour-blindness (as I tend towards), playing Rajas WILL be a challenge!

Worker placement with a ton of options.  Dice used as currency of various colours (think of the different currencies in Alhambra) and mainly spent on tiles to arrange on a personal board (like the cities built in Alhambra, but less challenging).  Two forms of victory points - money and fame. Multi-player solitaire except for worker placement's grabbed that before you element. Everything well integrated and more accessible than my description might suggest, because it's designed by the Brands. Nothing very original to make it stand out from the mass of euros.

Production quality is good.  The artwork is sumptuous.

Very nice game. Like the worker placement with dice as resources (not dice placement really). The theme (which is as pasted on as the next euro) is something I actually enjoy; I met my wife on a trip to Varanasi, on the Ganges river.

This is a clever dice roller and worker placement game with an interesting "score points on two opposing tracks until they meet" race mechanic that overall, felt fresh and fun to play around with.  Our two player game played very well.

The game also incorporates races on the board to get extra workers, a design touch that I liked very much.  The art felt fresh, original and interesting; I particularly loved the dice holders with many arms. The tile and road building portion of the game felt reasonably interesting if not too spectacular.  

I do get the sense that in order to play this game at a very high level, a great deal of thought ought to go into certain turns, particularly those toward the end of the game.  Many spots on the board "cost points" in order to make points, and that complicates decision making somewhat.  Other spots, are free making the mental calculating easier.  Other spots give you no points, but do set you up for more points later, IF a particular spot is available by the time it comes back to your turn.  Thus, the game does provide for some very interesting, deep, VP optimization, decision-making.  

On the downside, the mechanics of the game did not particularly mesh with the theme.  In particular, I did not sense that I was doing anything thematically in Rajas other than optimizing my fame and money rewards with each move.  

Bottom line:  Rajas is a game that is going to make a lot of euro gamers happy with its clever design touches and interesting worker placement decisions; I only wish it were a tad more thematic, though in truth, the wonderful art very nearly compensates for the lack of thematic game play.

The game appears to be open at first, but it's not. You have to do the money/points tracks first.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The game is gorgeous and simple to play but seems to lack any sort of depth which was rather disappointing. At its core, it's really just a racing game as you're trying to get your money and prestige markers to meet each other but it feels like you're constantly taking the same 2 or 3 actions every single turn and the game starts to feel incredibly repetitive 1/3 of the way through a single play. When one person gets their markers to meet or pass, the other players get one final action if possible based on turn order. This creates an issue where the end of the game can come up unexpectedly (partially because you really have zero interest in what your opponent is doing because it never seems to affect you and partially because the a chain of actions can cause your score to suddenly leap on both tracks), or you have that one final action but can't make up enough ground to pass them so there's no point in taking that final action at all. 2-player board feels too open and the number of tokens is too plentiful for the number of players; it just completely lacks tension. Had really high hopes for this one but ended up being rather disappointed by it. Sold it as we had zero desire to play this again.

From the creators of Village, one game I particularily enjoyed and preciously kept in my collection. Once you get the rules down (not difficult but quite a bunch of them), what you are left is a euro about maximizing your total points through 2 tracks, through very streamlined mechanisms and (above all) the only currency being dice! It looks cluttered but proved to be just fine in gameplay. The only (huge for me, one that kept it off my buylist) downside is the lack of theme and coherence, which is why I kept Village around. Great try though, mashing dice rolling with worker placement and tile playing in a euro.

A fine medium-weight worker placement game, but lacking the tension necessary to really make it interesting.

The dice use is far too forgiving of rolls, not just in that low and high rolls are both useful, but that it is easy to obtain additional dice and to flip the die to the opposite side for a different pip count.

Extra workers, as in most (all?) worker placement games, are integral to winning. The player who earns them quickest will be at an advantage.

Round clean-up is very quick - just pick up your workers and start again. That's a nice change of pace from the Rosenberg-style resource explosion.

There are a lot of dice in this game and, like many other games lately, it is a dice, worker placement game. You discard a die or dice and place a worker. One of the more interesting parts of the game is the win condition. Players are pushing their Money on one track and their Glory on another track. These two tracks are going around the board, one clockwise and the other counter-clockwise. Glory is tougher to get and can't be spent, but one step of Glory is equal to two steps of Money. The game ends in the round when one player's Money and Glory cross one another and that player wins, unless another player did the same during the same round and their Money and Glory are further apart after crossing.

You can hold up to 10 dice which fit on your statue piece and you spend dice to get more dice or to move your boat along the river for bonuses or to build buildings and markets in your town or to sell goods at your market or use one of the special locations which require a particular number. I'd like to try it again.

Very solid worker placement game with an interesting approach to dice usage and an innovative scoring mechanism. Gameplay is very smooth and fast, but I have the feeling that replayability could become a concern as there are basically only two "main strategies" (gold and fame) to pursue.

Enjoying Rajas so far. Easy to explain and with 3 different expansions (b-sides, river tiles and Mango plantation) it probably has a fair amount of replayability. It works well for 2 and 3 (haven't tried 4 yet) and is a good family game with enough interesting decisions. Play time of about 75 minutes is perfect for this kind of game.

I will need some more plays, but right now enjoy it quite a bit.
It plays smoothly, but has meaningfull decisions and the end game condition feels very original.
Might have some balance issues in 3 player games especially with mango villages.
Really good for 2 players though.

The two scoring tracks going the opposite direction is the novelty. It also could have been two parallel scoring tracks that you had to sum. 

As for game play, it seems obvious that one needs to place tiles asap so that you can get all the edge bonuses. 
Questionable replayability. Is there anything left to discover after two plays?

I know this is the jaded old gamer in me speaking, but I just have a hard time getting excited about these worker placement games that throw in everything plus the kitchen sink in terms of ways to score points and do various actions, without any sort of grounding in a coherent theme.

For example... (deep breath)... you can buy tiles to a personal board that might trigger scoring of some temples, each with their own track, to determine how many points you score for each type of temple, which you advance down using other actions. The tiles also contain markets, which you can activate via another action to produce money. There are these dudes you can activate that do special things. There's a boat you can move down a river to do a plethora of other various actions. You need dice to do most of this stuff, which you obtain and manipulate via other actions. Etc, etc, etc.

In fact, rule explanations for games like these always end up giving me a chuckle: "You can do this, and this, and this thing, and this other thing, oh, and then there's this thing, and this, and this thing". Worker placement games are the most susceptible to this sort of thing, as you can just add more spaces to do more stuff.

You end up with this Frankenstein monster that's kind of a fun puzzle to work out, but doesn't feel like it has any soul. Compare this to a game like Agricola. There's still a lot to do, but everything I do in Agricola feels solidly grounded in a theme. I can plow fields and plant stuff to harvest, I can build fenced areas to put animals in. I can build and upgrade my house. There's still a lot to do, but it actually feels like I'm working on something concrete (building a farm) vs. a game like Rajas, where I'm just taking a bunch of actions to do all these things that puzzle together, but I don't feel like I actually accomplished anything by the end of the game, win or lose, because nothing is grounded in any sort of distinguishable reality.

At the end of the day, I admire designs like this, as they obviously took a lot of effort to design, playtest, balance, etc. But, I'm liking this sort of game less and less as a player, as they start to become a dime a dozen. I much more admire the ones where I actually feel like the theme is present, making me feel like I'm actually working toward something concrete.

Excellent worker placement and tile-laying hybrid that uses dice as a resource in a really clever way. Players must gain fame and money by placing various tiles with buildings and markets in their province until their fame and money tokens meet on their respective tracks. It's a really clever win condition that lends itself to trying different strategies to achieve victory. The game is very colorful and the components are good quality. The game also comes with an "advanced" mode that really elevates the game for people looking for a bit more depth. Overall, it's an excellent medium-weight game that plays very fast with plenty of replayability. Highly recommended.

Love the artwork and aesthetics in this game. The dice look and feel really good, and I love resource games that use dice. This one is unlike anything I have really played before. It took a little getting used to, but I wouldn’t call this heavy. There are many ways to acquire resources needed to win and looks to have a few variants that can be added for more experienced players. The interesting part, there are no victory points. The game ends when a players money track meets with the same players game track, so its a race. Looking forward to trying more.

A solid worker placement game with a unique twist of trying to get your score and money to cross on tracks running in opposite directions by using 4 different colored dice that determine the strength of each action. Unlike in Stone Age where you place your workers before you roll the dice, here you know the values of the dice and can plan how to use them for the exact value you have. The board looks busy but there are really only 4 main areas to look at with the quarry, market, river, and palace. The quarry scores you points and gains you money plus allows you to achieve bonuses by placing tiles on your player board, the river gives small bonus actions, the market allows you to gain money based on the 3 types of goods, and the palace is primarily a way to manipulate your dice. It all comes together very well and plays quickly. We knocked out a 2-player game in 60 minutes, which was great. The game also comes with some additional advanced variants that will only extend the variability of this game. Another hit from the Brands for me!

After the excellent 'Village'i could not miss Rajas of The Gange. It's a good worker-palcement game, a main construction mechanism to learn, then 3 smaller ones that revolve around, it avoids dispersion and allows to understand where the stake is. I liked the final scoring system based on the gap between money and glory we are a little bit of the usual 'salad points' games. Of course, there is a significant chance factor even if it is well managed with the system of karma, it remains a discriminating element for this type of game. Note also, the many variants and the adjustment 'aux petit oignons' according to the number of players, desired complexity.

Après l'excellentissime Descendance impossible pour moi de manquer Rajas of The Gange. C'est un excellent jeu de placement d'ouvrier, un gros mécanisme de construction, puis 3 plus petits qui gravitent autour, ça évite la dispersion et permet de bien comprendre ou est l'enjeu. J'ai bien aimé le système de scoring final basé sur l'écart entre l'argent et la gloire ça nous repose un peu des jeux à salade de points habituels. Forcément, il y'a un facteur chance non négligeable même s'il est bien géré avec le système de karma, cela reste un élément discriminant pour ce type de jeu. A noter aussi, les nombreuses variantes et l'ajustement aux petits oignons selon le nombre de joueurs, complexité désiré.

RATING: 7
Nice dice game. Clever central idea where you can make money, and you can make VP, which advance on opposite tracks, and the objective is to make them meet. Advancing down each track will unlock new stuff when you reach checkpoints. I think the money side is strictly better, which is a little concerning. Lots of interesting things to do, most of which require dice. Nice little tile laying aspect where you buy tiles in different colors to build out your personal tableau, where tiles can (again) generate money or VP. You start at the top middle, and get rewards for reaching any (every) edge position. Every tile must have a path back to starting tile. Would definitely play again.

RATING: 4
Standard worker placement game with two 'gimmicky' mechanisms: two scoring tracks which run counterclockwise, with the crossover point of two scoring markers marking the end of the game; and continued shortage of workhorse dice which get transformed into more dice at an annoyingly glacial pace. You begin with three workers, and are likely to end up with five at the end of the game. There isn't much opportunity for diversification in where you place your workers: people tend to select the same actions because that is where money and straight VPs are to be had. The result is quite a bit of turn order friction (reminding me a bit of Caylus, of all games) which gets old rather quickly.

To be honest I don't think the double scoring track is worth the effort. Since there is a fixed conversion rate between the two tracks, there really is no difference in going this way or the other or in a combination of both. As in: the game won't play out fundamentally different because it's about making your actions efficient and then hammering them as often as possible. If efficient VP options are momentarily unavailable, go the money route; and vice versa. It's all the same in the end. In 4P-practice it turns out that you cannot even decide to go for a particular way of playing the game: there's so much competition between money and fame that most players end up in a 70-30 mix of sorts. 

What very quickly becomes a problem is the fickleness of Lady Luck in tiles and dice. You can't mitigate the tiles on offer and this is annoying because tiles are clearly different in their value, sometimes oddly so. Players soon learn to snap up the best of the best in order to grab as many side bonuses as possible: the game requires you to obtain a number of VPs before it can end (remember, money and fame are interchangeable in this respect) so it doesn't make sense to rush the building aspect with cheap ones featuring but two exits. Besides, the bonuses alleviate the stress on the main board. Dice are just as annoying. The design clearly favours some values over others, and mitigating dice is very expensive indeed. Even obtaining them is a very inefficient process when done via the provided worker areas, so quickly players annoy each other silly over areas where the dice obtainment is much more profitable. In total the game quickly becomes syrupy as players work out how best to use their sub-optimal routes. The game really is not meant to be played this slowly. 

All in all, not a fan.

This has to be my favorite game of the Brands. While all of their other games (with the exception of the games in the EXIT series) fall flat with me, Rajas of the Ganges was enjoyable every time it has hit the table. Although there's nothing really new here, it's the sum of the parts that makes this one good. I do enjoy the combo potential your moves have once the game gets going and the many possibilities to achieve what you're trying to do. Rajas has really caught me by surprise since after reading the rules, I wasn't really excited to try it. Glad I did and I hope it hits the table more often in the future. Who knows, maybe it will even go up in rating. Fun!

2017-12-17 : When I opened the box, this game had every sign I was going to like it with its clear iconography of the board and components, And the early signs were not wrong, this game is a winner : turns go fast, there's a clear goal and after having explained the game I just got 1 rules-question during the game, because it's one of those games where the board graphics and layout do an excellent job at summarizing the rules. The multiple avenues to victory were visible right in our first game, which gives the players lots of room to explore and play just how they like to play. This game just rocks. Another winner from the Brand team.
2017-12-19 : Played it again, now with 2 players and my initial favorable impression has even gone up a notch. It was a challenging game that was done and dusted in 45 minutes. You can't ask for more from a game.
2017-12-30 : We've now played it at all player counts - it plays well at all player counts, but the game is a bit more confrontational with more players as certain action spaces get occupied sooner. The average cost to perform actions also goes up in a 4-player game, so the end-goal will be reached slightly slower.
2018-01-20 : You know a game is a winner when you have 100+ years of gaming experience at the table and they request to play this one.
2018-02-13 : 7 plays in and personally I'm done with it, it's played out. Going to bury it in a closet for 5 years so it'll become fresh again.

I enjoyed my play of this and the end game goal of having your two score tracks cross is interesting, however as a worker placement game this one gives you a dizzying array of options each turn (35 spots) so it is quite multiplayer solitaire and if someone does happen to be in the spot you expected to take, then you simply pick something else and go back next round, there is no urgency to any of the actions. This multitude of spots also make it difficult to stop someone as usually there is another spot that does the same and/or very similar action and you cannot hope to block them all.

The die manipulation in this one is interesting as you can only flip your die over and you cannot add/subtract pips. Whilst this is interesting you can get stuck if you continually fails to roll say 3's and 4's as you have no other way to obtain them

I think I need a few more games to try different sorts of strategy to see if the gameplay feels  and there may be a run away leader problem, but overall I did enjoy the play of this and will happily play again.

Once you look past the "smoke and mirrors" of the two converging score tracks, Rajas of the Ganges is a pretty mundane worker placement game with a bit of dice management thrown in for good measure. The dice (and tiles) make the game quite tactical and, somewhat annoyingly, some numbers and spaces are clearly better than others, continually leading to fierce contention for the same few spaces. Since there is no fundamental difference between the two scoring resources you can (and actually have to) switch between them all the time, and with only three basic actions available (gain dice, build (for VP or engine), spend (for money)) the game quickly becomes a bit of a repetitive slog.

Bei den Brands liegt Spielen in der Familie: Vater Heiner Handballweltmeister und Handballweltmeistertrainer, Sohn Markus und Schwiegertochter Inka Spieleerfinder. Während ich mich für Heiners dramatischen Handball in Memorian Jo Deckarm stets  begeistern konnte, waren die Spielideen von Inka und Markus bis dato eher nicht so mein Geschmack. Einzig VILLAGE fand ich gut, MURANO okay, mit den EXIT-Sachen kann ich gar nichts anfangen. Nun also RAJAS OF THE GANGES und soviel kann ich schon sagen: RAJAS ist das bisher beste Spiel des Autorenehepaares. Dabei macht auch RAJAS nichts neu: WP wie gehabt an vielen, konventionellen Einsatzorten. Und was in ULM die Donau ist hier der Ganges. Dennoch zündet das Teil bei mir. Schön ist z.B., dass man sich die bunt durchscheinenden Würfel, die man zum Einsetzen der Arbeiter braucht, mit den Arbeiteraktionen wiederum besorgen muss. Oder auch der Spieleende-Gag, dass man sich auf zwei Leisten (Siegpunkte und Geld) selbst entgegenkommt, ist hübschi-hübsch, auch wenn die Idee etwas Augenwischerei betreibt. Auf leichtem Kennerniveau angesiedelt ist RAJAS eines der Spiele, denen es gelingt, das gute alte WP-Rad bequem fahren ohne es neu zu erfinden. Das typische Indienfahrrad mit der Doppelstange und dem fliehenden Lenker, das die Inder den Kolonialbriten zu verdanken haben, wird bei uns in Deutschland übrigens über den Onlinestore Indienrad.de vertrieben. Indien: Am Straßenrand in Mumbai sitzen halbblinde Bettler mit zugenähten Augen neben platt gewalzten Ratten. Schrottautos, Motorroller, Rikschas, Kleinlaster mit Gefieder, Ochsenkarren, Jesuslatschen und Füße aus Hornhautfersen verstopfen die Schlaglochstraße. Es gibt nichts, das nicht zum Verkehrsproblem wird: die Auslage des Obsthändlers, der versunkene Fakir auf seinem Nagelbrett, die heilige Kuh, die gerade ihre letzte Mahlzeit auf der Straße entleert. Öffentliche Toiletten stehen neben Chai Teeküchen. Über den Köpfen baumelt labiler Stromkabelsalat. Dicke Mamas waschen die Kids, die Klamotten der Kids und die verbeulten Blechteller im kackbraunen Ganges. Ein Geruchsgemisch aus Curry und Benzin hängt in der Luft. Auf den Fladentürmen sitzen Fliegen. In einer Seitenstraße nach Pakistan verbrennen Radikale eine US-Flagge. Gut, dass Art-Guru Lohausen für RAJAS ein thematisch schönes Indien gemalt hat, das nichts mit der Wirklichkeit zu tun hat und auch ein anderes Thema hätte sein können. Stattdessen eskapiert er uns in ein verklärtes Indien der Schönheit, der Gottheiten und Prachtbauten: geschmackvoll bunt, detailverliebt, fröhlich, lebensbehjahend, augenschön. RAJAS OF THE GANGES ist das spielegeschmackliche Pendant zu einem Glas Mango Lassie. Was auch eine gute Idee wäre: mal gemeinsam mit Heiner, seinen Kindern und Enkelkindern zum Inder essen zu gehen und über den VFL Gummersbach, RAJAS, Shiva, Karma, Kali, Gott und die Welt zu plaudern. Brand - macht leicht Appetit!

I liked it! I was a little nervous because RotG is one of the few games I've bought almost purely on the art (I have an art crush on Denis Lohausen these days.) Plus, the nascent reviews have been kind. This could have been a total JASE with nothing new, but its core mechanism - the converging Fame/Income markers for the win - feels innovative and drives a good part of why I like the game. While this might be a typical worker placement game in that you are using workers to activate areas for stuff, there is also a bit of territory building (a la Carcassonne) in here, and some interesting timing stuff to pull off in regards to players going before you and stuff costing you more the longer you wait to go there. The die do definitely play a big part in guiding your decisions, but for a cost and with enough variety of dice you can usually get a die to the side you want in order to take the action you're looking for. In the end, it all works quite well and while the game doesn't exactly scream 'innovative' it isn't just a straight re-hash of something we've seen before. Established mechanics re-worked into something new. As such, it satisfies and might be the best game so far that the Brand couple have released. I'm hoping further plays are as enjoyable as the first. (Also: skip the 'basic' ruleset and go right to the 'advanced'.)

Very good game, would certainly recommend if you don't have too much experience with dice worker placement/ utilisation games. For me, It runs too close to other games in my collection that I would not trade for it (Troyes, Marco Polo).  Cannot fault the design -- enjoy how your collected dice run from round to round -- but the game just lacks a bit on the theme. I wish the coloured dice were explicit resources or the town you are building was more dynamic.

A rare game in that despite its quality and my enjoyment of it. I feel no need to own it.

I didn't dislike RotG; it's just that nothing here really captured my interest. Minimal interaction worker placement game mashed up with the tile-laying mechanic on a player board a la Princes of the Renaissance. I hear Paul Dean somewhere saying, "It's fine. It's fine." 

It also has a smattering of Euro dice rolling that is just meh. The last game I played like this that comes readily for comparison's sake is Oracle of Delphi. And, yes, like OoD, you can mitigate your bad rolls. 

As others have pointed out, it has an unusual win condition of getting your money track to meet up with your fame track. But, for all its innovation, this too felt uninteresting. 

It's got beautiful art and everything fits together nicely but I've seen most everything in dozens of other games.

A masterpiece. Turns are quick, decisions are interesting, the artwork, dice and components are high quality and the paths to victory are multiple. All this in a game that is ultra fun to play and with an interesting race mechanic that allows you to focus on money, fame, or a combination of both. If you like feeling clever and triggering combo after combo, this game is for you. I love it. My only question is replayability. After two plays, there seems to be an optimal strategy that is hard to deviate from, so I wonder if it will hold its luster over time.

Really good worker placement game. On one side it‘s just „get resources and build things for getting VP“ but there is also money and you need both if you wanna succeed. Special end game conditions. Played Merlin the same evening (also for the first time) and found this better.

RATING: 7
Enjoyable worker placement game with dice used as resources. There may be too much luck, though, as manipulating dice is very restricted. Expanding your principality is a key point, and high numbers are strictly better to acquire building tiles - not to mention that these tiles may vary quite a bit in value, and what is on offer is random. The scoring system is somewhat original, with money and fame running in opposite directions around the board, their meeting signaling the end of the game and determining the winner.

I'm not sure if I like the race for new workers, as there is no benefit or compensation for getting behind. With only three at the beginning, an extra worker can make a lot of difference. And it seems that the game already suffers from a runaway leader problem, even with equal numbers of workers most of the time.

On the production, the board art is beautiful, albeit a little busy, and the translucent dice add to the visual appeal. The statues of Kali to store your dice are a nice touch, even if they are just flat cardboard pieces.

Probably needs some more plays to see if it can hold up, but it's a nice WP game with a cool and original end condition. As you need to get your money track to meet your point track you can play on both or ignore one of them, without losing anything.

Given, it doesn't feel any new, but to me it's fun, especially because of the end game, with many ways to explore and that's what I like in games.

Some ppl compare it to "Marco Polo" and I can see why, but this one is so much more interesting, but yeah, that's just talking about personal taste.

So far, good game!

Standard worker placement game with some exciting twists. Scoring is quite interesting, with two differently scaled point tracks going opposite directions. You win when you get them to intersect, allowing specialization of one kind or the other (or any mixture). Scoring tracks also provide bonuses along the way. The addition of the dice is reminiscent of a dice placement game, yet the dice themselves are not placed and so are sort of decoupled from the workers themselves. This all works very well. Not sure about replayability, but it was a very enjoyable experience.

I like this a lot. There's always something you can do with your dice, just get your engine going early, get your extra workers early, not sure how viable it is to race off down the river early? but the actions do obviously get juicier so it could be a viable strategy

Feels very much like a race game, though the finish line is having your two different currencies (money and wealth/fame?) cross each other on the scoretrack, so the finish line is flexible to whatever strategy you employing.

Being able to acquire your two additional workers is a big deal--if you get them much earlier than anyone else you'll be able to steamroll the competition with being able to do extra actions. Of course, the extra workers are obtained from reaching a particular point on the score track, so you they are like the carrot to drive the donkey forward anyway. Was surprised how quickly this game goes (it can definitely play under an hour).

Rajas has interesting worker/dice placement mechanics in addition to tile-laying.  You can create some good combos with multiple triggers.  The race aspect of Rajas is neat because you advance both fame and money until the 2 tracks meet.  Like any race style game, however, Rajas suffers from the fact that you can often see who will win about halfway through the game.

2018-02-24 - This is a pretty fun, if pretty abstract, game. The art is very pretty and the components are nice. I like the dice-as-resources element. Some of the actions aren't super exciting (trade one blue dice for 2 orange (or something)), but many of the other actions make up for that by giving you opportunities to chain actions together. I also enjoy the way the 2 scoring tracks work.

Mechanically, Rajas is a fairly typical euro worker placement game. The inclusion of a tile-laying/pathfinding element, its striking graphic sensibility, and the utilization of dice as a variable resource set it apart from the crowd. It is much easier to learn and to teach than its admittedly busy board suggests. The Mango Village promo is a worthwhile investment if you already know and love the base game. Rajas of the Ganges is one of my favorite releases of 2017.

Raja of the Ganges is a medium Euro that uses dice in conjunction with worker placement in a novel way. The game is easy to explain and plays fast with little downtime. 

You place workers in turn order until everyone has placed all their workers, then you retrieve them all and start over. Many of the actions require you to spend dice of a certain colour and/or value to perform the action you want. You retain dice between rounds and the only way to get more is to exploit bonuses or take specific actions.

I really enjoy the way the dice are used in this game. You can learn a lot about another player's available actions by looking at their dice. You also have to be very mindful of where your next dice are coming from. You can take slightly inefficient actions to get more dice, but it's much better to earn them as bonuses while carrying out other actions.

The game is a race to a certain number of victory points. They have tried to be clever by having two victory point currencies to obtain. The prestige track runs clockwise around the board and the coin track counter clockwise. You win when your two VP markers pass each other. Aside from a few subtleties this is equivalent to having one track and a target number to reach. The two tracks seem a lot more interesting then they actually are, and the race ending condition comes with all the problems that race games have. The chief among them being that players who fall behind have to continue playing despite having no hope of winning.

Given the play length and my adoration of the use of dice I will happily play this game whenever it's suggested.

RATING: 5
Rajas of the Ganges pushes all the wrong buttons. Another game that objectively is a good game but gives me negative enjoyment. After the first third of the game, I was only waiting for the game to end. Thus, a mediocre rating. 

It starts of with additional workers that you have to get as quickly as possible. I dislike this feature when it's a must to get them. Then, there's the obvious engine building. Raise the VP scales for specific buildings before getting them to squeeze out VP's more efficiently. Raise your karma and use the spots on the river giving you an additional die for each karma. Always have enough dice available to have a higher degree of freedom. Engine building to generate efficiency is the name of the game. 

Rajas of the Ganges is challenging. Timing your movement on the river, snatching away buildings before a competitor builds them, accessing and blocking worker placement spots. It's just a challenge I'm not interested in. The sources of efficiency are obvious. There won't be any new discoveries on replays. The victory condition is the outstanding feature of the game. The VP and money track are counter-rotating. When the markers of a player meet on these tracks, he wins. Both ways are feasible. The winner in our game didn't get much income, the second place didn't score many VPs.

Instead of sailing the Ganges, I'll rather ship down the Danube in Ulm.

Designed by Inka and Markus Brand (Village, Murano and the Exit Series), this is a neat worker placement game that uses dice as resources. There are two scoring tracks (fame and money) that start on opposite ends and the first player to cross their markers in the middle is the winner. Really enjoyable with unique mechanisms, only reason it’s lower in rank is that I’m concerned with the replay value because there is only a tiny bit of setup variability.

I hesitate to put this at the top of the spectrum when the publisher did such a shoddy job representing Hinduism.

You really know you like a game when every chance you've had to play it you get smashed and the only thing you can think of is, "Man, that was great!" Some of my favorite games are Euros that employ dice in creative ways (CoB, Macao, Troyes, Grand Austria Hotel, et al.) and Rajas fits along nicely with these. The unique thing about this game is that it's a combination point salad/race. There are two tracks (money and fame) that progress in opposite directions. The person who wins is the one who first makes their track markers cross. Meaning, the winner is not only the wealthiest or the most famous, but the person who is best able to balance both those things. This change turns what would be a fairly typical worker placement/point salad game on its head. Very cool. Inka and Markus Brand really are two of the best designers out there.

Definitely a great game to introduce people to the hobby. Maybe a "bit" meaty for a gateway, but I think it will do the trick. The choices to focus on money or fame each round are good choices to have and in some ways it feels like you are building a mini engine for each. Artwork is great and really pops on the table. Component quality all round is very good. Prefer this as a two or three player game, at 4 players the game is a 8 due to a bit more downtime than I like.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This is an interesting race game of sorts where you are trying to make your fame and your money tracks meet before anyone else. Dice and money are used as different forms of currency in this worker placement game. I kept trying to place my dice as my workers but you are supposed to place your wooden workers. :-) One builds a personal tableau in the process of this race. The board is a bit busy but functional. Managing your karma allows you to manipulate your dice by flipping a die to the other side.

First impression. This game is great. I have village and played their exit series. The Brands's always make good games. In spite of village being such an awesome game, sometimes it just falls flat and doesnt' hit the table as often. This game gave me a different vibe. The game flows so fast! it's intense. Every action feels like you are going back and forth trying to catch up or pass opponent. Even after first game, we felt the game was amazing and wanted to play right away! 
The actions (there are many) are pretty straight forward but interesting and you have many ways to go to try to efficient use both your workers and dice. There is also several ways to mitigate for the dice rolls. I just love how quick and entertaining the game is. Will have ot play more to see how the game feels after several plays. Definitely one of my favorite games of 2017

Dice worker placement with just enough things to do without becoming too complex. Main part is building your tableau by acquiring and placing tiles. This lets you generate income from 3 types of markets and VP from 3 types of buildings. You can also move your boat on the river to get boni. Innovative end game conditions, money and VP tracker start on opposite ends of the same track and game ends, when they meet.
I really enjoy this medium-light game because it has tile placement, you try to chain the boni, and it does not overwhelm you. There is also an advanced variant which I have not yet tried.

Rating after 1 play. What I liked:
- The dice usage and dice management on top of worker placement felt fresh. I have played quite some worker placement games (agricola, stone age, lords of waterdeep, viticulture), but will keep this one in my collection, because of the mix. Getting new dice, throwing them, seeing the results and the new possibilities this gives you is great fun
- Very good sense of progress. Getting new workers, getting past a threshold on one of the scoring tracks, unlocking bonuses on your personal board: you constantly get small rewards and can immediately start focusing on the next one. 
- Short explanation time: took me 10 minutes to get our game going.

What I found out I disliked
- Racing games can end quite anti-climactic, you do not have that 3-5 minutes of everybody saying how much they score in each category and then counting the score. It's just over when 1 person reaches the finish line and the others do not.

[b]Rajas of the Granges[/b]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6/8):[/COLOR]

[i]I was looking forward to playing Rajas of the Granges and when the opportunity arose at my local meet up I was able to play. Mechanically what Rajas of the Ganges offers is excellent; during the game you are managing a pool of dice that act as goods which can be used to perform a variety of actions you will choose via worker placement. Die value will matter, but thankfully there are ways to mitigate your dice/reroll them. There are a plethora of WP options on the board which appears to be complex at first, but once you learn the game everything makes sense and the board is actually laid out quite well. The main crux of the game is your individual player board where you are placing tiles that have roads and buildings on them. Temples provide points and Markets gold. This leads to one of the more interesting aspects of the game. You have two different tracks you move your scoring discs along, one for VP and the other gold. To win you are trying to be the first person to have your markers pass by each other. 

Thematically Rajas in the Ganges is a miss for me. There is nothing about the game play that ties into the chosen theme and the artwork is tiny making it difficult to really care about. This isn't a deal breaker for me by any means, I'll choose mechanics over theme any day, but it may turn some folks off. However; I do have one major concern with the game. Because there are so many different actions you can take combined with die manipulation means this game is prone to major AP. The 4p game I played in took over two hours which is way too long based on the weight of the game. There isn't enough there to think about in between turns for the game to take that long. Turns can be fast, but some players will want to math out every option in order to maximize each turn [i](I had the same issue with 5 Tribes)[/i]. In some games this doesn't bother me because there is a lot for you to think about when it is not your turn. In this game the decisions aren't that complicated or difficult which makes the long wait between turns somewhat painful. I also felt like the beginning of the game is scripted, it is imperative you grab your extra workers early [i](specifically the ones on the VP and gold tracks)[/i], I failed to do this and was behind the whole game.

While I would like to play Rajas of the Ganges again, I'd prefer to try it with two. Will you like it? That depends on how much you want to play a worker placement game that adds dice manipulation to the mix and you don't mind the game having a completely pasted on theme.[/i]

Dice placement euro. The board is a bit busy, and the mechanisms are fairly abstract. You place tiles on a personal board, containing buildings for points, and connecting roads to get bonuses. You win by having a combination of money plus fame, so you could focus on one or the other. 

There are no player special powers, so I don't see why I would ever choose this over Marco Polo.

Super game. I really like this and whilst most people I've spoken about this game highlight the two tracks that players try to get to meet since they start in opposite ends, I actually like the worker-dice mechanic a lot more. This is what makes the game a success to me. Players have got workers that need to go onto the board and have got die that determine how they can use their workers. The fact that dice are not regained at the start of a round makes this a brilliant mechanic as player need to be constantly checking that they got enough dice so they can actually use their workers.

Excellent game and really looking forward to play over the coming weeks. 

I have finally gotten to play it again and this is a very exciting game. The planning is slightly askew thanks to the dice rolling that might not always go your way, and a plan that is usually straight forward to pursue is made just a little more unpredictable tipping your opponent's towards victory one round, yourself another round. Very exciting indeed!

What a great game!  A nice medium weight Euro with a pairing of two of my favorite game mechanics: worker/dice placement and tile laying.  Pick the best actions with your dice to be the most efficient.  And there are a lot of options for you to choose from.  Place your tiles to score points, earn money, and possibly also get bonuses.  And on top of all that it's a race game with a unique system of racing down a points track and also a money track.  And the artwork is great.  Very colorful!  Great game!

A kitchen sink euro with a scoring track gimmick that has been done before (RattleBones).  The game was fun to play, but due to the fact that there is very little in this game to separate it from the pack, I can't imagine this game being played much even 6 months from now.

Rajas of the Ganges is a worker placement game that uses dice as resources. The main use of the dice is to buy tiles, which can either have buildings that give you fame, or markets that can be used for income when you use the market action. This market action lets you use either one of each type of market on your board, or all of the same type of market, though the latter requires that you use an extra die. Advancing on the money track or the fame track provides rewards at certain points, such as extra workers, extra dice, or moves on the river (which can provide a variety of one-time bonuses). The unusual part of the game is that the fame track goes clockwise and the money track goes counterclockwise, and the game is over when a player reaches the same point on both tracks. I thought the game was fairly interesting, though getting the extra workers does cause a bit of a snowball effect. I didn't like how using the market for similars had an extra cost, that seemed to make it much worse. On the whole though, this was a good game.

RATING: 9
I don't generally like race to the finish games, but this one blew me away. The way the game works is each player has three workers, and some number of dice. The dice get rolled, and represent the different resources in the game. Some action spots only require a worker. Others need a worker and then a die of a specific value or value range. Still others require a worker and one or more dice of a specific color, with the pips across all dice needing to total or exceed the requirement. The game doesn't have any inherent die income, so you have to be careful and clever about where and how to get more dice.

The main purpose of the dice is to purchase tiles which get laid into your player board. The tiles have roads that must connect to your starting spot, but which may also connect to the edge of your board which grants you a special reward. We played the advanced game where the printed rewards are pretty dull, but you can get much better ones to replace them through a few ways, which allows you to customize your path through the game in a really compelling way.

The game ends during a round that someone's dollars marker meets their points marker on the oppositely oriented tracks. This means a big money strategy is just as effective as a big points strategy in theory, although you'll want to do some of everything in this game, as each major track has a spot it grants an extra worker.

Turns are pretty quick, there are marvelous combos you can line up with the various rewards, the iconography is consistent and clear. The components look nice, especially the dice. The process of solving the puzzle feels satisfying. When you run aground it's because of your choices as opposed to die luck or being punched by other players. There's some, but minimal player interaction. It's mostly the occupying of action spots you wanted and the taking of the edge of board scoring tiles you needed. I'm very excited about this game, and I'm hoping to play more.

Pretty much a standard worker placement. Money and dice are used as resources. It has a nice idea of using two scoring tracks of fame and money and the winner is who can get them to meet. but the game to drive the tracks didn't capture me.
There are so many options on the board it doesn't feel that there is significant competition. Yes there seemed to a couple of good ones that would get grabbed first but rest seemed all the same.
The tile laying mechanic on a personal tableau didn't seem to mesh. I guess it is to try to force limits on the players so they can't just pick any tile. 
Like all worker placement games getting new workers out is a primary goal.
The board is way too busy for my tastes, and distracts from the game. 

All in all Village is a superior implementation of the worker placement strategy, it would be the Brands game that I would keep, I'll pass on this one.

The theme does nothing for me, the board is super busy, and it is just not visually appealing to me. But the game is very solid. There are two key mechanics that separate this from the other dice placement games in the field. First is a scoring mechanism I have never seen before. You have two scoring tracks, money and victory points. They start at opposite sides of the board. When those two tracks pass each other then the end game triggers. After the round is over the person who overlapped their two tracks the most wins. Secondly, there is this nice dice resource management that you would have to see. Hard for me to explain. Bottom line is I wouldn't buy this one because it would basically be a great mechanics game with zero theme or art for my eyes to enjoy. At this point in my collection I can choose to be picky. I would definitely play this one again if someone suggested it though.

Clever race game. The board is super busy but after someone explains what all the icons mean it's actually very intuitive and easy to remember. I like how you can go for economy or fame primarily in order to get them to cross first, and even if you have to switch to the other for an action or two, it's still not hurting you and advancing you to the end of the game.

There seems to be a bit of a rich get richer situation going on in the game, which I usually get annoyed by, but in this game I wasn't bothered by it at all. I think the get richer effect is milder than some other games and there are multiple approaches to bumping up your scores anyway, so if someone feels weaker in one aspect, they might be stronger in another.

Rating could go up a bit with more plays.

A relatively light worker placement game – despite the busy-looking board – in which dice are used as resources. There are no brain-burning decisions to be made here, nor are resources in short supply. Instead, the game derives its tension from the race to converge players' fame with money.

The rounds in the game don't feel discrete despite players taking back their workers each round, which feeds into the the race-like atmosphere of the game. The tile-laying minigame is a neat little diversion too. But despite the presence of three tracks (fame, river and money) from which players can unlock their workers, I do have concerns over the overall replay value of the game. Still, this is a pleasant surprise which moves fluidly enough.

1 play prototype, 1 play published

It’s a worker placement game with dice allocation. The board is wide open, with lots of places from which to choose (and no real direction to guide you, no scoring goal card ... just your own strategy. You start the game with 4 dice, then use your workers to do a variety of things (some of which require a specific die count or color): get more dice, build a tile onto your player board (and earn money/fame), improve the fame value of building types, move your boat along the river (getting some bonus from the space you land on), etc. If you move your tokens (coin, fame, boat) far enough, you get an extra worker (up to max 5); you also get bonuses after passing specific targets along the way. All of which is pretty typical stuff. The twist is that players have 2 scoring markers (coins, fame) moving in opposite directions. You win by having the markers meet/cross each other (and if more than one player succeed, whoever’s markers are furthest apart wins).

It’s OK, but just OK.

Then there are these own little player boards that every player has, where you make a little kingdom - carcassone style!

I liked this, but I could see my rating going up or down on subsequent plays.  It has interesting decisions and solid artwork.  On the other hand, luck seems to be a fairly big factor, and racing to get extra worker has no drawbacks, so you must do it as quickly as you can.  It's a race game where getting to certain markers in the race makes you go much, much faster, meaning that the rich get richer, and I'm not sure how I feel about that.  I'll be interested to play more to find out.

tl;dr quite good indeed

The Brands have been a bit hit-and-miss for me, but the last couple of years they've had more hits then before. And this game definitely is a hit.
This is a dice placement game. Certain actions require certain colors of dice, others requite certain values. So good die management is essential. But that's not just an interesting mechanism in a shell. No it's been integrated into a very good, tight game that appears to offer a good variety of different strategies to explore.
On top of that it has a rather unique scoring mechanism with 2 different makers moving in opposite directions. When they cross, the distance between them determines your score. But the way you move them (and witch one to move) is what the game is all about. Lots of choices!

Attractive and interesting race game.  The end game of the meeting of the two tracks is good.  Starting to feel a little samey after 4 plays.  The money track seem much easier to implement.

(Full disclosure: I was a play tester for Rajas of the Ganges and helped R&R demo teh game during the 2017 Essen Spiel). Interesting worker-placement game that encourages specialization in some ways (especially in terms of racing up a particular track to get your extra workers) and generalization in others (the money, fame and river tracks all have great benefits and optimal play probably means lots of activity in all three areas). I love that high dice rolls aren't necessarily better than low rolls, but rather do different things (high rolls help you build, low rolls help you move on the river, etc.). Enjoying this quite a bit.

Early impressions: I am a fan of the Brands since Village.  I have enjoyed many of their designs. Rajas is their latest offering which is strictly classified as a worker placement Euro with a slight twist to scoring: there are two anti-parallel score tracks of money and fame. The end game is triggered when the scoring markers in these two tracks converge with the winner being the one having the biggest differential score between the two tracks.

The track is unique but the game play itself is not nearly as much. It is quite the standard Euro worker placement game with players jostling for spots to build markets and monuments on a personal board. The game also consists of two forms of currency: Dice and money. Because the money track is one of the scoring tracks, money does not feel tight and is plentiful. Fame points however are much harder to obtain.

First, the game itself feels a bit of a letdown. While the scoring twist is novel, the game play is not and rather fiddly. Constantly moving the money track back and forth is slightly annoying and I am sure, we may have occasionally messed up the accounting. To make things worse, payment sometimes comes in term of dice AND money both. We all felt that some spots on the board are "unbalanced". Some of the spots on the board are also quite underutilized. For example, in our 3p game, not a single person used the "take 1 die" spots. Meanwhile, the "take 3 dice and 2 money" spot was ultra-competitive to the point that it was usually the first spot taken by the starting player. Perhaps with 3 players, there is less competition and this game is more suitable with 4. Finally, the game did feel relatively anti-climatic if players avoid conflict or choice denials. If players each went with their specializations, then the money track become slightly out of hand. Since there are 3 commodities, perhaps this game will shine with 4. 

Overall, the game was underwhelming first time around but deserves a few additional plays with a higher player count.

Light euro with dice for resources, all sides/pip counts are useful - though some are situationally more useful than others.  The converging tracks of money and fame are novel.  Okay puzzle like aspect in the player boards.  The game still seems as though it is a little lacking, but perhaps more depth would be uncovered in additional plays.

Very cool dice mechanic and loads of thing you can do with your turn.  So many ways to score points.  Really like this worker placement game.

Worker placement where most of the actions also use dice. Players gather two types of points, and the game is won when the two score markers pass each other. Board looks busy, but single actions are not complicated.

The most boring game I've played in a long time. Visuals are gorgeous, yet the game is completely flavourless.

Way too tactical.
The endgame rule sucks, not playing the whole round. It would be easy to houserule, but it just shows how little the designers wanted to make this really strategic. There are other mechanisms where this tendency clearly shows (white yield tokens, river spaces, tiles available).
Only being able to manipulate your dice by turning them over is interesting but at times it can be really frustrating to only have 3/4s when you want something else and having no way to get it other than to get new dice.
The whole vp-money two tracks meet thing, which seems to be the hook for the game isn't really interesting at all, it mostly just means you can spend vps you gained in a certain way.

Excellent point-salad Euro using dice exchange and worker placement mechanics.  I like the way you need to balance fame against fortune and join the two for the hopeful win.

very heavy german with intricate actions and overfull board. after a few turns you start understanding what's going on. It works well, turns aren't too slow despite the wealth of info and possibilities. All in all, it's not my cup of tea but I enjoyed playing it after the initial headache

I loved it the first time I played it, but after 3 plays, it seems to me that the '3 different goods' market strategy is really overpowered. Unless all players go for it from the very start of the game, you'll have a runaway leader that halfway through the game starts raking in 5-7 money each round because there is no competition for the action spot. Going for 3 different goods is also better than going for the same type of goods, because you don't have to give up a (high valued) die in order to take the action. Some of the characters in the palace (mainly nrs 2 and 4) are also clearly overpowered compared to the others. Overall an okay game, but  in its genre there are plenty of other games in my collection that I think are better.

Economic development in 16th century India along the Ganges river with worker placement actions in conjunction with spending values of colored resource dice.

Innovative scoring track that creates excitement as they draw closer. I find myself exploring options early then later using that infrastructure to maximize the money/fame gained each turn. Three different currencies and two scoring tracks may be intimidating, but they integrate quite well.

Have not tried the advanced game, but hope to pick this one up soon to try it out!

Inka y Marcus lo han vuelto a hacer, un euro rápido, combero, que va a ver mucha mesa y que me recuerda un poco a Marco Polo, pero que aun así pueden convivir perfectamente en la ludoteca.

Was selled out at "Spel 2017" in Antwerp. We bought this at our LFGS.

We love Markus & Inka Brand, so this needed to be in our collection. Now finding the time to play this.

Wow. Another fun filler from OINK, in the ilk of Deep Sea Adventure. There is an element of greed like DSA. You want to play daring when you can. TROLL is a hidden "gem" of a game.

Yet to complete a game. But it's a neat bluff game where you try to steal gems as thieves from big trolls. You can be cautious or daring and as your thief cards run out, your aim is to either steal or avoid getting caught by the troll with good timing on your side and luck if you dare not to be cautious.

I like the role of the scout as you are able to set up the other players by being the first to peek at the troll card and declare how many jewels you want to steal.

The rules are a mess, but the game itself is quick + simple. Lovely opportunities for mind-games. I'm curious how it plays with 4 (my one play is with 3).

I think this game is a really smart design in an incredibly tiny box. More plays needed

Troll is a good little 25 minute game of clever bluffing and push your luck.  WIth all the components in such a little box it completes the fine trio of Onik games in tiny boxes: [thing=169654][/thing] and [thing=135779][/thing].

RATING: 7
Components: lot of things in a small box
Complex: easy to teach and learn
Weight: light
Players: 4 or 5
Length: 20 mins aprox
Mechanics: bluffing, nothing else but bluffing
Decisions: enough for these kind of games
Opinion: go into the hole of a troll and try to catch as much jewels as possible.
So, you have to decide if you go slowly and cautious, playing one of your tiles face up, or dare to go for everything, playing a tile face down and doubling the winning.
A day has several rounds, and in each round you go into one Troll hole. But you have a limited numbers of tiles for each day (from 0 to 5). You have to bluff and take risks. Should I go cautious and try to secure my jewels, or I think I can go for a high amount. But this also can play with the thoughts of your opponents (he has play a high value,  I think I can risk).
And lets say that you only can take jewels up to an amount, and this is the number printed on the Troll card. If you are caught the Troll bites you and you get minus points, if you go over that, you see the bite to the previous thief and can run away without penalty.
As said, fast and funny game, with a small box that you can take with you almost anywhere

TROLL is a press-your-luck, crowd type game where players can bluff, double-or-nothing or play cautious with numeric bids of treasure.
If others play cautious as well as the scout, then the last player will have all the information needed to maximize their efforts.
Double-or-nothing blind bids double the rewards or the penalties if one is caught by the TROLL; they also lend some fog of war: are they bluffing or not, did they intend to go large and get someone else caught while they run away.
Its a clever little game. I'm starting this game off at 7.25, and hope to enjoy it with a group soon.

I might have to try this one again. I played with 4 and it seemed like turn order really dictated your behavior and your choices were pretty terrible. I am a huge fan of Dungeon of Mandom, but this press your luck game fell pretty flat for me.

The rulebook makes this game needlessly complex, but once you get the swing of things, this is a very quick, fun, and challenging game of bluffing and risk vs. reward.

The components are well-crafted and sturdy, though I do wish everything was a bit bigger, especially for the 10 pieces at make up the X- and Y-axis of the "resolution grid".

[i]I absolutely love the aesthetic of this game. I always appreciate minimal design and the art in this game pulls it off quite well. 

The game play is fun, if a bit wonky. The rules are obtuse and make everything sound much more complex than it is. In the end it is a very simple push your luck game with great art. I do think that the game can devolve into a betting game in later rounds because you have no choice but to try and score big knowing you have no other way to win. This could potentially dilute the experience and make it less about bluffing and more about gambling. Still, I had fun playing and think this could definitely be a fun, family game. I'm looking forward to playing it again.[/i]

--Jun2015-- Perhaps over-rated slightly on the significant enthusiasm of my sons.  But this really is "our kind" of short game - misdirection; havoc; a bit of deduction and logic: quite nice.  It's also susceptible to bad play, I've discovered:  If the players want, they can make a rather poor gambling game out of it.

RATING: 7
In each round of Troll, players can either choose to peek at the current troll's value before playing a number, or blindly play a number in exchange for doubling the eventual payout. When the troll is revealed, the numbers are added up in ascending value and any player whose number is equal or below the troll's value walks away with a reward.

Troll stands out as one of the more layered designs in the Oink Games line. Along with the usual elements of bluffing and pushing your luck, there is also a bit of deduction thrown in as trolls and players' numbers are not reused in the same cycle. It can be quite dry and calculative depending on the group you're playing with, but nonetheless I think this is one of the best in the series.

First I didn't get it, thought there is no game inside. Then I realised there is a dry deduction game. I'm not smart enough. Or too smart. Or something.

Fun third member of Oink Games' tiny-box series. I still prefer Deep Sea Adventure and A Fake Artist Goes to New York, but this is still an enjoyable push-your-luck and wager-making game.

Troll is a press your luck bluffing game that is really short and sweet - just how I like this type of game best. It just makes estimating how much risk your fellow players are willing to take really fun. As with all Oink games, the game is stunning looking, with sturdy components and highly stylized artwork. A perfect end of the evening filler.

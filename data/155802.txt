Nice kid's game with a nice game progression during play.

Still would not play it with adults, and my son was not that taken by it.

Really nice light game.  It is a collection game where you have to decide whether to collect coins (points) or animals to be able to move better, to better collect coins.  It looks quite nice, all the miniatures are different, and I specially like the non defined moment of the end of game.  Quite good for the family.

Korrigans. Who is it for? 

I got roped into playing a few games because I have a friend that is obsessed with gnomes and leprechauns. It's got more game to it than something like Candyland, but it's still not great. It's much too light to set in front of a gaming group, but might work for kids?? But what kid likes gnomes and leprechauns? They are weird and creepy, like grandma's collection of porcelain cherubs. I just have trouble envisioning the crowd this is for. 

Beyond that, the rule book is not clear on a couple of things, most notably, the turn structure, which feels incredibly wonky. The components are okay, although I've never once thought stickers were a good choice. The color scheme is cute. The animal tokens are cute. 

I would never ever request or even recommend this game; there are better games out there that achieve a similar weight/complexity and have much more interesting themes. But, I know I will end up playing it again (because of circumstance), and that's acceptable.

This is quite a good family game, and I feel this game could be grasped by young children.  There are also enough decisions to entertain adults.  The theme is unique, the bits are very nice looking, and the game is fun.  This is a great title that should be more popular.

Despite the first rate components, Korrigans feels and looks like a children’s game: which isn’t to its detriment at all, as Korrigans is a light and slightly thematic family game that works best as a gateway game.

A cutesy family style game with top notch components.  No brain burning here but a simple family friendly game for all to enjoy.  Perfect for a St. Patrick's Day gaming session.

RATING: 5
Nothing too exciting. We had a lucky player hit on almost all of the gold in the pre-pot o' gold stage. Now, that can be waved away as a fluke, but he still got to the pot o' gold as easy as anyone else. To me, this indicates that the problem of optimising your gold is poorly constrained since choosing to either go for early gold is much more beneficial than doubling up on animals since the map isn't that big.

Cute miniatures but quality of other component (chips, the game board) are very poor. Our board was teared apart since first couple days because it stick together with only thin paper.

Gameplay. It's too much randomness on how animal gate are distributed over the board. This poor randomness show up during the end-game when we can't reach the gold pot because we have no luck to discover some overpowered animal like bird, mole and frog. Not about the planning at all.

Collect tokens before the rainbow. Either it is gold (victory points), or it is "companions" that allow you to move from one field to the other.

Korrigans is a great, light weight game which reminds me a lot of classic games, with a good amount more of gameplay to be had than those of yesteryear.  The whole production is really beautiful and something to behold from start to finish.  I also really like the randomness of both the game itself and when it will end, as well as where the game's end will take place.  As long as you're not looking for much strategy, this one is right up there with some of the better luck-based games.

Bunches of theme in this light weight game.  The bits are very nice, but my board started coming apart on the very first play.  Treat it very carefully and you probably won't have a problem.
You are a Korrigan, a small dwarf-like creature from British mythology.  You are trying to find the most gold, including the pot-of-gold that appears at the end of the game, by riding your animal helpers around a map while you search through the four leaf clovers.  Clever mechanics fit well with the theme.  Decisions are not brain burners, but are important to success.

RATING: 3
THE GOOD: 
This game's components are top notch.  The sculpting on the little leprechauns is well done.  The punch-out chips are from a thick linen-finish cardboard.  There are also a number of smoothly finished, different colored wood discs and small rock formations.  The board is rather large and beautifully detailed as well with its lush, bright colors.  Sadly, that's where the fun ends.

THE BAD:
There are usually multiple cardboard tokens/chips on each field and when you land in a field, the player secretly reviews them all to decide which one they want.  This flipping of tokens every time you land in a field gets rather fiddly and disrupts any kind of flow of the game.  Also, the placement of the colored discs in the margins eventually says where the pot of gold will appear.  It doesn't take long at all for it to show up at all.  Turns play extremely quick and once that seventh disc is drawn (one is drawn on each turn) the pot of gold is revealed.  Now you race to get there.

THE UGLY:
During the game, you collect animal tokens (the aforementioned tokens/chips) that allow you to move in certain ways from field to field.  Each token can be used an infinite amount of times before the pot of gold is revealed.  Cool, right?  Yes!  Then once the gold shows up, each token has one use.  We quickly discovered that if you don't have the right animals to get to the field where the pot of gold is, you're essentially stuck.  Nothing like playing to a stalemate.  In chess, that's an acceptable outcome.  Here, it's a nuisance.

One reviewer wrote:
I am a hardcore euro gamer at heart, but there is always a place for the light and whimsical in any collection. I absolutely recommend this game for its charming, unique theme and its light, press-your-luck, exploration-style gameplay. Kids will love it, and adults will find it relaxing and easy, but still interesting enough to hold your attention for 20-30 minutes.

Cute, easy to learn, fast to play, nice to play with kids, but not much there for gamers except that it's cute, easy to learn and fast to play. Basically, wander around the board and hope to stumble across the big-gold tokens, but there are decisions on whether to pick up move tokens vs gold tokens along the way with the hope of having enough move tokens to earn the end-game bonus (getting your pieces together on the last remaining spot). Happy to play as a pseudo-filler when the brain cells are dead.

I like heavy games, like ZhanGuo, but I certainly can also enjoy this kind of lighter family games, with very nice components and artwork. 

You just have to make the best of it, there's a certain level of strategy in it (don't leave the bonus rocks for your opponents! and should you take the gold - the points - or the animals for more flexibility?), but off course you need a bit of luck with the hidden chits.

A family weighted game with a refreshingly unique theme.  It is main a tactical game however, there is some sneaky strategy when planning for the pot of gold.  Seems to play better with more players as the board tighten up.  Fun light game that is worth breaking out every St. Patrick's day.

Rated as a family game

For just gamers, it's a bit too random.  For just kids, it's a bit to complex.  With a little guidance, the kids can learn to think ahead.  However, even then, it's a bit overwhelming to consider the options and there is very little information to choose between them -- so it's a lot of time spent working out options for little gain.  It's still a fast game, so this isn't a disaster, but it's a serious weakness.

However, for kids (like my -year-old) learning to plan ahead but liking a lot of like, this is a good mix.  They have to think a bit ahead, and they can play competitively.  In fact, I'm currently 3-0 against my kids -- good for a family game, but  bad sign for a serious game.

I do like the trade-off between collecting gold (VP gain) and collecting animals (options now and chance to get the pot-o-gold later).  The animals steeds are also quite cute, which helps the game with kids.  My daughter seems to have a much better intuition for this trade-off than I do, and she beat me regularly.

for adults: 4/10
for families: 7/10

tl;dr: OK but unremarkable

OK, so the theme is pasted on. You're walking around, increasing your maneuverability to enable you to get to the right spot at the end of the game. Fine enough, but very unremarkable. There's nothing wrong with it but I do feel it is terribly overproduced. It feels like they knew this is a mediocre game, but they upped the amount of fancy components in able to to be able to sell this. Let me remind you: there are enough great games with great components, there is no reason for me to spend money on mediocre games with great components.

Rating after one play at Essen. Felt a bit too light for our taste. Not sure how much strategy there is. 

To move your two pawns, you need to find animal tokens. Once you have an animal available, you can keep using it and pass the connections with the animal symbol. In the end, you want to reach the pot of gold with both tokens, so you want to find the animals necessary to reach all areas. When you don't find an animal or don't want it, you can usually pick up some gold (victory points). It is always good to be first in an area, so the best gold coins or animals are there to chose from.

This is a solid game for kids.

It teaches a lot of Euro mechanics without being too boring for adults.

There's hidden information, a variety of ways to move, even a privacy screen.

The menhirs give special abilities.

Everything works together very well, and the components are awesome (except the board; mine ripped a little when I unfolded it for the first time).

I gave this one away because I don't have kids this age and some friends' kids really enjoyed it.

Full disclosure: I received a review copy of this game from the company.

Easy light fast game, maybe not many interesting decision, surely not much strategy but a good deal of tactics. Too random when it comes to organize your pieces to go near the gold pot as this comes out quite randomly. I didnt like the abrupt end of the game but yes, we knew the end could have come that fast.
Nice art and pieces, exept the fact that the symbols behind menhirs aren't easily visible.

FR - Acheté à Essen Spiel 2014, après une partie d'essai à 4 joueurs. J'avais listé Korrigans comme un jeu pour enfants avec une thématique amusante: c'est en fait un jeu avec plusieurs dimensions et une réelle finesse stratégique. C'est un bon jeu pour entrer dans le jeu de stratégie avec une course au trésor très attrayante! Une bonne surprise, toute la famille en profitera, car il est prévu pour 5 joueurs.

This game oozes charm.  Great artwork and components draw little (and big) gamers right to this game.  My 4 year old even can grasp the gameplay pretty well... though setup is a bit too much for her to enjoy.  Get different animal tiles to give you access to different areas of the board while trying to gather more gold than the other players.  Pull rainbow pieces from a bag until a grid fills up making a pot of gold appear then use your animal helpers one last time to get the gold.  Charming, straightforward, but still with some interesting choices.  A very fine family style game!

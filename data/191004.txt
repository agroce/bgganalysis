So yes , a kids game. Yes a mechanism of roll and move is there, but blended together with the worker placement of the parent game AND a memory game the kids are familiar with. I kinda want to try playin without the dice tokens after a few more plays to see if the straight worker placement game is worth much. It is doing great in teaching my five year old how to examine costs for buildings and see if he has what he needs to build it,  while the strategy of trying to hit particular resources or buildings will come organically as he ages

On my scale this is very much a kids game.  Scaled down so much that it almost doesn't resemble the original game.  However this is a good game for kids.  I also found out that adults who are not deep into board games can enjoy this as well even when not playing with kids.

Stone Age Junior is a funny and well crafted kids game, reminiscent of Stone Age, with a great production value.
There is a clever use of the memory element, with movement (and therefore resource gathering) dependent on face down tiles.
The art and the hut-building are tied on its parent game, but it is in no way a dumbed down version of Stone Age: it is a good kids game, and a smooth and solid design.

Yes it's a kids game, but I liked it.  The SdJ Jury did a great job with the Kinderspiel nominees in 2016.  This game has some meanness to it and a lot of memory work.  Good times.

Wow. Great introductory resource management game for kids. My kids took to it very quickly and started pulling it out to play it (sort of) by themselves. Will gladly play this with the kiddos. 

The game looks great, doesn't play too long, and has interesting elements to keep kids interested, but is not so complex as to overly confuse them. Recommended.

There's a strong nod towards Stone Age, but with much simpler interactions and a little bit of memory game thrown in for good measure.

7 & 10yr old - fun game for the kids. They enjoy the oversized tokens and the simple game play, sometimes that is all you really want.

Game does require players to be on the same skill level. I found I had to make "mistakes" the whole time against my kids. A quick game to play and a great gateway game.

Great game for kids and the components are simply outstanding. Thick tiles, big wooden bits, and a functional player screen to stand up your collected huts. My almost 5 year old seemed to figure it out pretty quickly, which was nice. The memory element is good for the most part as it's not possible to remember where every movement tile is to get the exact resources you need, but with 3 huts out all the time it's almost too easy to get the right combination of resources for any of those huts. I also think more switching of movement tiles after the build action while adding a slightly higher randomness would help when playing against children. Overall a great choice for Kinderspiel des Jahres and I look forward to playing this for the next few years with my girls.

My favourite game to play with my 5-year-old daughter at the moment. It's introducing her to concepts like set collection, saving goods of the correct type to spend them later purchasing cards.  It also rewards paying attention and memory, so I think we'll get lots of use out of this.

2017-09-30 : This is a brilliant design. The original game boiled down to its essence : resource collection to buy buildings, with the genius twist of adding the very important memory element to it, thus ensuring adults and kids can play it on the same level. The kids just love this game and I'm pretty sure a game with only adults would also go down well as a 15 minute filler.

This is a good game for younger players.  They have to collect resources and decide when to use them to buy which huts.  More savvy players will look at their opponents' resources and try to buy up huts that their opponents can buy too.  

Perhaps a small step below Catan Junior in terms of fun but good nonetheless.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.1
Easy enough for my 4 year old to play, but so easy that my 9 year old can play it too well.  We tried making a change from the rules to make it less memory based, but that made it too much reliant on chance to keep the resources cycling. It's enjoyable, but not all that well balanced for multiple age groups.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.7
I still think the base rules are broken. Once the hut tile is revealed, it's so easy to cash in your resources, that it's not even challenging for a 4 year old. However, after we house ruled this game (shuffling ALL tiles after the hut tile is revealed), it becomes a much better game and one that my 7 and 5 year olds have really gravitated to. This raises the rating in my mind up two full points, maybe higher if my kids keep asking for this to hit the table.

I was a little disappointed with this game.  It was fun, but I was hoping for a little more to the game, maybe an actually worker placement mechanic.
I bought the game to help introduce my 5 year old to games. His favorites right now are Splendor, Spinderella, TTR first Journey, and Tsuro. He even does alright with Forbidden Island. This game seemed below his level and didn't interest him very much. It is a very quick game and at least helps him learn resource  management/set collection.
We will play it more, but it will not be one we recommend. Possibly a good introductory game for kids not already playing games.

Resemblance to the parent game, but dice rolling has been replaced with memory mechanic used to move around the board. Collect resources and buy huts (3 to trigger victory). Probably only enjoyed with younger ages present, but a high production value with art, pieces, and children's story written in rulebook. A "Don't buy this" at least until there are younger gamers in our group.

I don't rate games on a curve, and so I have to give this a "4" compared to other games I have rated.

BUT I would certainly boost this rating by two or even three if I am playing with the target market, a five-year-old new gamer.

A beautiful game, simple (not too simple) rules. Great first step into the hobby.

Try some house rules to increase the complexity (swap three tiles, and mix those three up so nobody knows which is which--this is what we do).

Great quality, and kids love it! 
I love watching my 4-y daughter stalking for the dog or the hut. And while it is supposed to be for 5+ she got it from the very first play.

A good game for kids to get to grips with basic planning: set collecting + memory. Stunning visuals and straigforward gameplay draws kids in, and the memory element keeps adults engaged. (Yes we suck at it, I only bother to memorize 2 out of 12 actions - the one for building huts (need 3 to win) and one to get a dog (joker resource, can be stolen away from others)). Its biggest strength is really it's simplicity and immediacy (within the idea of making plans and collecting sets). 

Compared to parent game - no engine building, added memory element and only 15 min long instead of 60+ min. 
Oh, yes, please.

An OK set collection and memory game. Great for really young gamers, but not something I cared too much for.

Children's game.

The kids liked this. It required more thought than some of the other games. It has a memory mechanic but also board movement and game piece collection.

The first real game I can play with my oldest child. With little simpler rules my 3 year old girl really liked it. The things we simplified are that we didn’t change the location of two "trees” after the village "tree" has been resolved.

Kids game only, marginally retains parents' interest - at least more than other kids games. Memory element in movement, collect resources to build 3 huts for the win. Very basic stuff. Same graphic design and artist as it's older inspiration.

My 3 year old is able to play this - with some supervision and occasional guidance. She absolutely loves it and asks to play Every. Single. Day. That's a good thing really.

This is fun to play with kids, but there is a strong element of memory involved.  To make it a little more challenging it's a good idea to shuffle the forest tokens when they are reset.

This is a well produced game as a pure introduction to gaming for kids.  My son used to use this to play with his (non-gamer) friends.

The game itself will make any self-respcting board game player want to drink heavily; however, I must admit that the components are very well made and it helps to teach some good gaming concepts to your little one.  Kids age 5-6 will probably enjoy this game, but it's not something a 7 y/o would enjoy for the most part.

(Rated as a childrens game where adults can participate)
Expected a worker placement that adults can play with their kids. This is not it, this is memory/roll and move... Children will probably love it but as an adult I would probably not be able to do more than teach them the game once and then go pick my back hairs one by one rather than play another game.

Excellent remake of the original Euro game for children aged 5 and up. Had two sessions yesterday with my son aged 6 and my daughter aged 4 and they loved it! My son actually told me that this is the nicest board game in their (children's) collection! The price is a bit steep but the game is beautiful to behold! Reccommended for children!

This is a great game for introducing civ-building games to a young audience.  My son picked it up quickly and we have a lot of fun with it.  The production quality of the pieces is outstanding.

Para niños pequeños, pasando de la oca a algo más complejo sin pasarse. Deben planificar los materiales que necesitan y en vez de un dado usan las fichas de bosque, que hacen que ejerciten la memoria.

Played it again not so long ago. Very stock standard war-game of its time, although lighter and had the political aspect which was a bit different. Found in a three player game we simply ran out of components... and no-one was going to win for hours so we gave up. Not a glowing endorsement.

Takes very long unfortunately, and I do mean unfortunately. Galactic domination is an awesome theme, tons of bits, and politics. One down side for me were the backstabbing and gang-up qualities. This is not a game to play nicely, and you&#039;d better be thick skinned.

I really rate this despite the time taken to play.  If you like huge, sprawling space epics you need this game in your collection.  Any game that allows for so many quotes from all your fave sci-fi films must be good!  (It's the only reason I'll play that boring Dune game)

This game bogs down. It is very slow, and it doesn't reward aggressive game play.  Easier to sit back and fortify, than strike out.  The new edition makes this game a 6 instead of a 5, but for $80 I would have liked to give this game an 8.  Fiddly rules, balance issues and epic play time would be cited.  C'mon FFG get it together.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
[v1.0] PROS: Inspiring chrome and components, conveys the feeling of empire-building. CONS: Giltchy gameplay with poorly defined rules and insufficient components; on top of it all it was overpriced. Even with all the supplements (Borderlands, Distant Suns, The Outer Rim, Twilight Armada) the game felt glitchy and the pricetag had moved into the realm of the ludicrous.  [v2.0] I eschewed this edition out of disgust after just spending a fortune on a less than adequate game. [v3.0 - http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/12493] I recommend third edition.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Longish, complex, but fun game of exploration, conquest, and empire-building. Lots of deal-making and diplomacy for players to engage in, to. Set aside six hours for this one.

I have first edition.  The random Hex board makes it interesting.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
2nd edition.  2 plays with 5/6 people.  Much troop build-up, turtling & diplomacy.  Basically, most of your time will be spent trying to convince opponents to attack each other (instead of attacking you).  Takes TOO LONG to play.  If you like diplomacy games, you might like this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not my cup of tea; I don't generally like games that combine heavy fighting with heavy negotiation and I tend to turtle.  I do like this game more than most of its ilk though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A little to long for what it is (I'd rather play other ScFi games), with some balance problems. Definitely doesn't work well with 3 (2 gang up on the third ...) but is good with 4, more than that and it drags and drags.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great game of empire building. Can be a bit long and is prone to standoffs.
I´m not sure yet if I prefer the original or the third edition. This version feels more epic and has a smaller footprint. On the other hand the new version plays a bit more dynamic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I probably haven't played this in twenty years, so I can't remember fine detail. Pretty severe turtle selection: the winner is the one who can stay out of the most fight, in our experience. I seem to recall the races were somewhat imbalanced, although I couldn't say which way at this point.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is a fantastic game and I can't wait for the 3rd edition!  The only things that keep this game from a [10] for me are: a) the length - it's not so easy to set aside a full day for this jewel; b) we're all a bit too predictable at it now 'cos we've played it so often; and c) I can never win!

RATING: 7.5
Yes, the game is not quite as elegant as our German games. It's very much a design of the American boardgame design school. Unsurprisingly, that means it is long and at least for my gaming circles going to be rarely played due to time constraints.

War... Materialschlacht WWI style is very typical for this game. Yes, you can also blitz another weaker player, but often both sides will sink a lot of hardware into fighting. 

Tech advancement and particularly the politics is where the game shines. I just love it. And I have to say that I even get sucked into the scifi bit - a genre which generally leaves me cold. Starwars leaves me pretty cold for one and Startreck... well never watched one episode to its conclusion. Not my kinda stuff. Twilight Imperium oddly enough is.

2nd Edition:
I grabbed this a couple of years ago and saw a great game in there however the unnecessary bookkeeping and cumbersome interface really held it back.  But finally the 3e is coming out and it looks to have fixed all the problems of the past.

RATING: 7.7
I picked this up for cheap--it has already proven itself a wonderful purchase. It is surprisingly addictive to otherwise non-"gamer" type people because who doesn't want to crush and destroy their way to an empire? It does have a bit of an initial learning curve, but that goes away quickly, and while fiddly it provides a good game experience.

RATING: 6
Finally played this. I have the second edition with the expansion. American as opposed to German design elements. Longer playing time. Long rules but once you play your first game its very intuitive and easy to learn. Some downtime as well especially in a 6 player game. However I may try simultaneuos movement in my next game. On the positive side it has great Sci Fi elements. The basic design of the game is superb with a good tech tree, space combat, unit design, economic system, political system, leaders, action cards, random board creation. This game has a ton of things going for it.

regarding the 2nd edition: Good game - really wets my appetite for the 3rd version!! Love the space exploration, the races, the techs... Really good game for the old MOO fans and other strategy enthusiasts who enjoy more to their games than just combat. However, be prepared for the downtime in anything greater than 3 or 4 players. That's my main fault - that and the system could be a little more robust.

RATING: 7
Nice looking pieces (most of them, anyway), pretty good mechanics, and good interaction. Also very long, some aspects are pretty weak, such as the technology, and the millions of chits you have to keep track of. Still, I tend to lean towards liking this game, even with its flaws.

I am not sure how fair that rating is, nor how good it is.  I do remember enjoying the game, but it is long.  It&#039;s weird.  I really want to like long war games and I really think I should, but think I tend to get to competetive and that takes something away from it for me.  Maybe it was the fact that it was the first time for all 5 of us.  I think 4 players would be more fun, as it would be shorter, not that I would mind a long game.  So it is this double talk that I do that makes it so hard to rate games.  In the end, I was hoping for something more complicated.  Not sure what that is, but it seems if I am going to play 6 hours of a game it better be a damn complex game and twilight&#039;s combat system, doesn&#039;t fall into my &quot;damn complex&quot; category.

MOO2.  If those four letters make your heart twitter, then you need this game.  But dang does it take forever to clip all those pieces.  Argh!  3rd edition is so much better in every way that I just can't support a rating of 9 any more.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
All the races mass up a big fleet near their homeworld and stare at one another.  If you feel like losing...you can always attack someone.  This game is really 100% diplomacy.  The rest of the game is just window dressing.  The goal is to get others (preferably your neighbors) to attack someone else while you keep massing up your fleet and/or gaining tech advantages.  And boy does it drag (mainly due to everyone trying to convince others to screw someone else).  However the combat system is the game's the biggest failure.  Lose one big battle (via dice roll), and you're done...eliminated.
If you are still wondering about this game...I'd say it is very similar to Axis and Allies except there are 6 capitals, no alliances, and the capitals are 1 space from each other.
Played 2nd edition...6 players.

RATING: 6.5
(2nd ed.) Wargame with space theme.  The political rounds are great fun, and make one really feel like a galactic ruler in a council.  Minorly different alien powers and starting forces surprisingly add a lot to the theme and different strategies.  The game tends to be too long, though, and I dont like some of the victory conditions; technology is too expensive and varies too much in its effectiveness.  There are not enough ways to do well with less powerful military strategies.  Playing with a balanced map is essential for a game this long.

This game seems cumbersome at first, but after a game or two, it's really not bad at all, and it has a ton of great atmosphere and gameplay.

Occassionally with a 3 player game you build up a massive fleet just in time for somebody to win, and that's anticlimactic as all heck, but more often than not, hell breaks loose and all is good.

There is a slight issue with fitting all the pieces on each hex, but the game is pretty simple to learn and a lot of fun to play.  As far as war game go, I prefer it to most anything else out there. Also, try to have more than 2 or 3 players involved. With only 2, if one player is stymied early on, the entire game is screwed. I played with 5 players and the guy in the weakest starting position (see rules) won. I had one round where I got hit HARD from two sides and lost almost everything and within 3 rounds was back in the thick of things. I love a game that forgives that allows a guy that is behind to rebuild and reenter the game.

One of the best long-run space-themed wargames ever made. Takes 10-12 hours to play with an experienced group of gamers. Expect heated negotiations, especially with the political phases of the game.

I own the second edition. This really is not a casual player or family game. The game is long (maybe too long...) and because of that some of my friends don't want to play it. Personally, I think this is a great game. I like the flow of it, I like the different phases and I particularly like the fact that it's really hard to win a military campaign. That kinda forces the players into alliances and treachery. You have to look at what's hapening on the board. My main complaint is that it can really suffer of the gang up syndrome.

I'm sure this was a groundbreaking, trendsetting game in its time. I played it for the first time in 2014, by which time space 4x games have become numerous and have improved on the concepts here (and TI itself is in its 3rd edition!). It is a well-designed game and the experience was overall an enjoyable one. It was very time consuming and anticlimactic in the end. That being said, I was glad to have the chance to play this game and, while I probably wouldn't play it again, it gave me a sense of appreciation for its influence on the genre.

Second edition - wish now that I had waited for third. A really grand scale strategy - with some intriguing politics and diplomacy added. Only played a few times, but enjoyed each time.

After additional plays, finding it a little slow. Points for scope and epic feel, though!

UPDATE: Changed rating down to reflect length of game (for what you get)

Own 1st and 2nd Eds plus expansions. Bought 1st ed for counters as plastic bits are a pain. (May be fixed in 3rd ed?) Need to intermix aggressive and more timid players around the board or the meek may inherit it all. Lots of fun to play.

Update: Have TI3 but only have played a few rounds. Big change in strategies from prior incarnations.

This game has everything I want in a game: domination, trade, war, civilization expansion, diplomacy, great bits (it's not true that the plastic units are bad). After re-reading the rules, I think that this one + the expansion Hope's End provides a great and deep playing experience. Too bad it lacks a good 2 players variant.

A 4X game that is clunky, too long, and fraught with balance issues.

RATING: 7
Chaotic, long and occasionally rather luck-driven, but still a lot of fun somehow. The game length is definitely the biggest drawback and makes it rather likely that I'd rather vote for Game of Thrones, Mare Nostrum, Warcraft or another newer game when we've decided on something big.
Played 5 times.

RATING: 9.5
1st edition - 2 sets. Nice blend of mechanics from Settlers, Axis & Allies, Risk & Cosmic Encounter. Ive made a few special scenery hexes for this game myself. Raised this to a 9 as it has consistantly been a game where I walk away from a game of 4+ hours feeling like I want more.

What a fantastic game !  One of the most played games in my gaming group... just complex enough for the adults, yet easy enough for the older teens.  A good balace between the different races... the expansions are a must have to make this game really rock.  I wouldn't buy the new TI3, its slower and has more flaws...the pieces are nice, but I like the counters better.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Though this game wasn't downright terrible, it sure wasn't well balanced.  I've played 5-10 times, and each game ended too quickly, before you could really develop a strategy, and before some races could take serious advantage of their bonuses (and it *still* takes 2-3 hours to play!).  It's a near-miss, with really nice bits, cool set up, interesting use of cards and voting, but basically just didn't work.  I hear the first edition took longer to play, perhaps shortening the game took something away from its playability?  Definately better than Chinese water torture, though.

Don't get me wrong - prior to the third edition, this was rated an 8.  Now I rate the third edition an 8, and this version drops out of my favorites.  A great game, but just very overshadowed by its bigger (but younger) brother.  I'd never play 2e if 3e were available.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The big piles of little plastic starships are always fun, and this is the best game in a genre I love, but it's just not great.  The rules are awkward in places, it takes way too long, and the font used on the board pieces is difficult to read.  Someone needs to do a more elegant "German" version of this.

That being said, one strength of TI is the perfect variety of units.

2nd Edition.  Only based on one play, but it didn't grab me.  However, the whole concept DID grab me, so my game buddies and I may splurge for 3rd Edition.  In fact, I will probably play this again, and then my rating might rise.  Great rules, but hugely cumbersome talley process each turn.  Some players will not play without their laptops close at hand!  There were no tech tree charts or player mats included with the game, and they are essential!  The Political phase is nice, but often meaningless.  In fine, a lot of counting and re-counting and not a lot of bang for the buck!

RATING: 7
Great empire building game. It has good amounts of diplomacy, negotiation and war.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Based on 3 plays my rating simply indicates that I had a pretty good time with this one. I especially liked the political and diplomatic aspect of the game. The "Laws" that are randomly brought for voting provide a bend in the rules that add variety without altering drastically the mechanism of the game. What I didn't like is the bookkeeping that was required and the playing time which for our group of 6 was more than 7 hours.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An excellent abstract strategy game. Perhaps the best game I've played that manages to combine strategy, diplomacy/politics and economics. I recommend only getting the 2nd edition, since that contains both new plastic units and better rules. It might focus too much on politics for some tastes, but I value that kind of player interaction very highly, so I love it. :o)

RATING: 5
The prologue is fine - building units, moving out, settling new planets, building techs - and then you realise you need to conquer over half the board to win and each player has a chance to whack back any player who looks like they're getting too close to winning. And you realise with 90% of the game gone, there's probably another 90% to go, that everyone's going to end up with the same techs and it's then a matter of just building units, hoping not to get hit, and hoping to sneak under the radar enough at some point to launch all those units for the win. So would you play again, knowing that the end-game could be 90% of the game? Probably not.

(5+ plays) This game really hasn't gotten a proper test, since most of the time we have played with 2 or 3 players.  It isn't simple, but not too difficult either.  There are quite a few rules holes, but most questions are answered on the FFG website.  It could be a great game if we tried it out with more people, but don't bother with only 2 or 3 players.

New rules made this game a hit!We play with a time or round limit, and we get points during the game for the new planets, conquered enemy units and new techs which we note on our secret papers. At the end the one with most points win the game. With standard rules I'll give it a 5.

It's a fine game.   I just wish there wasn't a lion-dude in the mix, especially on the cover.  The whole Kilrathi thing was silly in Wing Commander and it's no less juvenile here.  (I hate Wookies, too).  Of course, the whole business of playing a game, any game, that pretends to tell a future history is fairly juvenile, but you have to draw the line somewhere.  I draw the line at goat-head aliens, lion-people, etc.

I wouldn't call this "average" (a 5), but I doubt I'll even play this "sporadically" (a 6). It's a good war game, but it's too much of a war game for me: I'm not generally into games of direct conflict. And all that negotiation in the political phase ... what a pain in the ass! I am not a good negotiator, and I'm not good at lying/misleading - I'd rather not make secret deals, etc. I will probably not play this ever again.

Just a great game.  It has luck, but I feel it is less complex than the 3rd Edition which is a good thing.  Still plays way to long.  Roughly 7 hours in 3 player games.  Obviously that time can come down and come down fast, but with that length we can't play it enough to bring length significantly down.

Played 4 player recently and this might be my favorite space epic now...just need to get the time down...and more players...is that to much to ask.

I own both the first and second edition of the game. I consider it my favorite boardgame of all time. It's suitably epic in scope, it plays very different depending on the race you play, the layout of the board, and countless other factors. With a focus on the political aspects of war, I can't help but love Twilight Imperium. The 2nd edition improves and streamlines the game and appears to be very successful at it.

The first edition was quickly followed by four expansions sets in 1997-1998: Twilight Imperium: Borderlands, Twilight Imperium: Distant Suns, Twilight Imperium: The Outer Rim and Twilight Imperium: Twilight Armada.

RATING: 7.5
A good game.  The political aspect is great fun.  However, overall it doesn&#039;t have as many hard choices as some other games.  Quite often your action phases are quite simple as there&#039;s not really much alternative over what to do.  In lots of ways the game is very linear - you start at one point and move out from there.  Technology purchases allow you to employ an overall strategy building on your race&#039;s strengths.

After one 6-player, 7-hour, game, all players agreed that the game took much too long and wasn't enough fun. The different player powers and starting positions can easily put someone in a hole right from the start that they'll never get out of. "Pound on the leader" causes the game to drag on and on. There are lots of stats to keep track of and no mats or charts are provided to help you. But it does have a cool theme! So I give it one bonus point for allowing me to destroy the squishy humans, with their hot, mammalian brains...

A space combat game with a Catan-style randomized board.  Some people apparently like this game, but every game I've ever played has quickly bogged down into a stalemate, as players realize that fighting weakens them almost as much as their opponent, for minimal gain.  The politics and technology, while adding flavor, do little for the actual gameplay.

A game of galactic warfare.  Pretty good in a genre that hasn't seen much, recently.  The problem I see with this game is the layout of the planets.  Too often, one player gets enough good planets and storms into the lead, while other players get screwed with no way of competing.

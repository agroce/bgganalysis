One of several "Dominion clones" that is better than its sire.  In Dominion, the available cards are known at the outset.  In Ascension, you shuffle a big pile of cards and six are available at a time.  Because of this the game state is always morphing in surprising and interesting fashions.  A strong deck can become weak if the wrong cards come up in the middle, so it's more common for players' strategies to evolve over the course of the game.  Dominion is like taking a swim in an indoor climate-controlled swimming pool.  Ascension is like trying to swim in the raging ocean.

The events are a cool addition to the game and the Fanatics make it a bit less painful when you have a hand full of attack and no monsters.  Unite is kind of cool for the Lifebound faction, and the Trophy monsters give you more flexibility with your monster bonuses.  All in all, a very good expansion.

RATING: 1
Aesthetically, goes a little more Faerie and less Mysticism. Feels like a bit of a stretch creatively and is immediately off-putting. 

Mechanically, the game becomes too busy. Cards are less efficient than their base game block forebears. Events exacerbate problems with variance, rather than complicate it. 

Dynamically, this set just plods. It really shows that there wasn't a lot to the base game, but that base block played fast and hard to compensate. This set makes you carry your bad cards for longer and seems to give you a lot more turns where nothing happens. 

I really don't recommend going with this set at all. I can make a weak recommendation for the base game block if you're heart is set on it.

I really wanted to like this game, but it just didn't click for me (doesn't mean that the game is bad, in fact it was fun to play once in a while).

RATING: 7.9
My impression of this game is quite positive, though it's gone down from how I initially perceived it. The artwork and theme is not my style at all, but the gameplay flows quite smoothly. The game is more finicky than Dominion, with a lot more text to read and little details to pay attention to, but the balance seems to be struck very well, and there's some interesting effects and interplay between types of cards. In an average game, luck plays a somewhat larger factor than I like, but although that mostly balances out over a game, there's some cards and some games where luck causes way overpowered point swings.

Downtime becomes quite an issue with more than two players, and this is not recommended with more than three players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
General thoughts on Ascension: I generally like the game, having the right level for complexity for what it is. It's definitely better with a low player count, as with five or six players (which you can play with only by combining two sets) the downtime gets a bit too much and the center line changes too much after your turn to really care about what is there. Combining sets is also problematic, as it make the deck unshufflable. If I were to ever buy a copy of Ascension, I probably get only set and player as a two-player game.

Storm of Souls adds some more cards to the base game and, besides the more variety that's always good in these kind of games, adds a few interesting choices: now players feel less on "autopilot" mode.

Better than the original.  The additional basic monster (Fanatic) to be fought, the event cards, and the fate/instant events all improve the plain, mechanical feeling of the base game.  It's an okay deck-building game; however, I don't like the randomness of the draw deck compared to having control over purchases in other deck-building games.  For example, on my first turn in one game, I bought a green hero that benefits from having other green hero cards but almost none of the green cards came out until halfway through the game.  Another example is someone with only 3 runes (money) available buys a cost 1 card and then gets lucky as 2 more cards that cost 1 each get drawn consecutively afterward such that he was able to buy 3 cards with his weak hand.

Storm of Souls is basically a better version of "Chronicle". This stand-alone expansion relies on the same basic mechanics, but re-forms the four "factions" of the original into more cohesive play styles/strategies, while also allowing them to blend nicely together to create interesting interactions.
Storm of Souls solves the problem of the Mechana faction being overpowered somewhat, while also making that faction more fun to play.
Overall, a solid improvement over the original game. Can be played either as a standalone or an expansion. Admittedly, I've only played it as a standalone, but I quite like it.

RATING: 3.5
I like the graphics and the materials. BUT, it's really too kind in plans and tactics. Too short in time, it's impossible to plan one or two great ways to win... so it's always almost luck.

And either you play carrefully or play anyhow, you can win (i have a greater score in buiying all things i can).

The great point, is fluidity and easyness... but at which price?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like that there is a new permanent monster next to the Cultist: the Fanatic can be used once after it has been beaten to gain a small bonus depending on the current event in play. Events are also a nice addition, changing up the game a bit.

The game feels very turn by turn, as the random release of cards makes planning a deck out in advance very unlikely to actually work out. 

However, once I learnt the card mix, I felt encourage to attempt to build certain decks. Most of the time this works out well. Unfortunately, some times the random release of cards means you don't see the cards you need (because they never come out, or because someone else buys them), and you just sit there, sub-optimal and frustrated.

For trade in UK Math Trade or BGG Trade.

Components checked.

If you're an experienced deck building player then Storm of Souls is probably a better place to start than the original Chronicles of the Godslayer (re-named as "Ascension: Deckbuilding Game") which could be a bit too basic (or "vanilla") for experienced players.  

All of the sets in Ascension are not particularly deep or strategic.  There is randomness in the way Ascension plays.  But I love the Ascension sets because they're quick to set-up, the  turns are quick, the ease of play, trying new sets mixed together is fun and being able to play cool combo turns when you get some really good cards in your deck is so much fun.

SoS adds a couple of new features, such as the "Event" cards and the "Fate" mechanic and Trophy Monsters, giving more variety than CotG.

The artwork is much improved from CotG as well.

Until it was completely replaced by Star Realms I loved Ascension. I used to forgive the ugly artwork, just because it was giving me such a great experience.

Expansion and/or stand alone game in the Ascension family.  This game adds a couple of new rules - trophies, which are on defeated monsters, and can be held until cashed in for some sort of reward.  There are also suited events, which last until discarded/replaced, and change the rules in subtle ways.  The new card mix is very interesting and takes a little getting used to - you need to adjust your play style slightly to get the most out of the new cards.  All in all, good stuff.

This is Ascension, but it adds Events, Trophy Monsters, and a new basic card: The Fanatic which relates to both events and trophies.  Trophy monsters are monsters that are placed in front of you when killed and can be cashed in for a bonus effect.  The trophy monsters are great and give players more flexibility with the monster effects.  The events come out randomly from the center deck and relates to either one of the four factions or the cultists.  They each change the game with their unique effects and when the fanatic is cashed in as a trophy, the effect is determined by the event in play.  I ended up enjoying the events a lot more than I thought I would.  Two of the five events favor violence based decks which I think were generally a bit underpowered in the previous cycle.  I guess what I really think makes this set stand out above the previous one is that it makes Violence-based decks a more interesting to play with more decision making. Basically, I think this is a more interesting and more balanced base set than Chronicle of the Godslayer.  Highly recommended!

Why is it previously owned if I rate it so highly: The digital edition has killed my interest in the physical edition.

Type: Expansion to Ascension

New board with two new category spaces: one for The Fanatic Trophy Monsters and another for Events.  Interestingly enough, I don't feel this complicates the game.  when all the cards from all the expansions are added in, you may or may not get an event during the game.  A player can have only one Fanatic Trophy Monster in front of them to eliminate events.  However, a player might not want to eliminate an event which gives bonuses for other cards he holds.  Other trophy monsters that hit the center row are no more complicated than the other cards, just more variety.

I actually think this expansion improves the game, especially when the overpowering Leprechaun expansion is included, because the cards now have a reduced chance of multiple draws.
   
EDIT: I recently placed an order from the publisher's web site, and had a complaint which I registered by email. Gary responded immediately with apologies and corrected the problem with a very surprising bonus. This is a top notch company who cares about their product and customers, and they go the extra mile. Thank you, so much!

C'est amusant le monde du jeu de société. Et c'est aussi un peu à part, ça a ses particularités. Par exemple, si vous écoutez un album de rock récent (prenons, au hasard, les Black Keys), vous allez peut-être faire des comparaisons avec les autres albums du groupe, mais vous n'allez pas aller jusqu'aux origines du rock (ou même à aller jusqu'à dire qu'en fait, c'est le même genre que Led Zeppelin, mais en moins bien). Pareil pour les films, quand vous donnez votre avis sur un film, vous ne remontez pas à l'origine du genre de celui-ci, même si on peut l'ancrer dans un style et oser quelques comparaisons judicieuses.

Alors que si on parle d'un jeu de deckbuilding, la comparaison à [url=http://www.trictrac.net/index.php3?id=jeux&rub=detail&inf=detail&jeu=10483][b]"Dominion"[/b][/url] est immédiate. Certes, le jeu a posé un jalon en terme de renouveau ludique, mais la façon qu'on a de comparer un jeu qui emprunte le même mécanisme de base à celui qui l'a initié est assez unique pour être remarqué. Du coup on parle de [i]"Dominion-like"[/i], de [i]"Caylus-like[/i], alors qu'on parle peu de [i]"Simon & Garfunkel-like"[/i], pour rester dans le domaine de la musique.

Cette introduction absolument sans rapport à la qualité du jeu faite, allons-y de notre petit avis, qui bien sûr, fera quelques comparaisons avec [url=http://www.trictrac.net/index.php3?id=jeux&rub=detail&inf=detail&jeu=10483][b]"Dominion"[/b][/url], seul autre deckbuilding que je connaisse. C'est après plusieurs parties lors de tournois ou de soirées organisés par la boutique strasbourgeoise bien connue que j'ai finalement cédé et acheté [url=http://www.trictrac.net/index.php3?id=jeux&rub=detail&inf=detail&jeu=16985][b]"Ascension"[/b][/url]. J'avais bien aimé mes parties, et finalement je me suis dis "Pourquoi pas ?". Depuis, de nombreuses nouvelles parties ont été jouées, dans plusieurs configurations. Et c'est bougrement addictif. On en fait une. Puis la revanche. Puis éventuellement la belle. Et on ne se lasse pas, surtout à deux : ça tourne vite, c'est dynamique, trente minutes et c'est bouclé. Les parties, malgré des stratégies dont on a vite fait le tour, ne se ressemblent jamais tout à fait du fait du tirage des cartes, du tempo que l'on décide de suivre, de ce que fait l'autre... Il peut parfois y avoir une certaine frustration due à ce tempo qui ne nous sert pas toujours, où certaines cartes nous passent sous le nez, mais alors on ne peut s'en prendre qu'à nous même de ne pas avoir optimisé notre deck pour éviter cette frustration.

Pour ce qui est de la comparaison à [url=http://www.trictrac.net/index.php3?id=jeux&rub=detail&inf=detail&jeu=10483][b]"Dominion"[/b][/url], auquel j'ai joué avec uniquement la version de base, je trouve que l'interaction est plus présente. Pas vraiment directe (peu de cartes d'attaques), mais du fait de la ligne centrale et du nombre plus restreint de cartes de chaque type. Prendre une carte, c'est en priver l'autre, même si ça alourdit notre deck ça peut valoir le coup. Mais c'est aussi en faire venir une nouvelle qui lui sera peut-être plus utile. Bref, on fait des choix, on prend des risques, on joue certes de notre côté, mais contre l'autre quand même. Alors que dans [url=http://www.trictrac.net/index.php3?id=jeux&rub=detail&inf=detail&jeu=10483][b]"Dominion"[/b][/url], prendre les cartes, sauf si c'est la dernière, c'est rarement aussi gênant pour les autres joueurs, même s'il y a peut-être plus d'interaction directe. Autre différence, la rejouabilité. Pour le coup, c'est [url=http://www.trictrac.net/index.php3?id=jeux&rub=detail&inf=detail&jeu=10483][b]"Dominion"[/b][/url] qui me semble avoir le plus de potentiel de ce côté, avec des parties qui peuvent vraiment changer du tout au tout selon les cartes disponibles. Dans [url=http://www.trictrac.net/index.php3?id=jeux&rub=detail&inf=detail&jeu=16985][b]"Ascension"[/b][/url], les parties sont moins variées, les actions sont souvent les mêmes, mais il y a tout juste ce qu'il faut de changement pour éviter la lassitude, c'est plus dans le tempo et dans nos choix que les parties vont être modifiées, peut-être plus subtilement. Dans [url=http://www.trictrac.net/index.php3?id=jeux&rub=detail&inf=detail&jeu=16985][b]"Ascension"[/b][/url], il me semble aussi moins nécessaire d'avoir un deck "pur". Dans [url=http://www.trictrac.net/index.php3?id=jeux&rub=detail&inf=detail&jeu=10483][b]"Dominion"[/b][/url], certaines cartes sont vraiment des poids morts et encombrent (les cartes qui rapportent les points), alors qu'ici, aucune carte n'est absolument inutile, au pire elles sont moins bonnes que d'autres, mais elles peuvent avoir de l'intérêt, ne serait-ce que pour marquer des points en fin de partie (encore une différence qui profite, je trouve, à [url=http://www.trictrac.net/index.php3?id=jeux&rub=detail&inf=detail&jeu=16985][b]"Ascension"[/b][/url]). Ce qui ne veut pas dire qu'il ne faut pas épurer un peu si on veut optimiser ses tirages.

Dans les deux cas, jouer à plus de deux semble superflu et pesant. Dans [url=http://www.trictrac.net/index.php3?id=jeux&rub=detail&inf=detail&jeu=16985][b]"Ascension"[/b][/url], ça demande de plus s'adapter car la ligne centrale a plus changé lorsque c'est de nouveau notre tour, donc un peu moins contrôlable, plus chaotique, et surtout plus long... Il faut toutefois noter l'intérêt du jeu en solo, qui s'il ne vaut pas l'affrontement, est agréable, gérer Némésis n'étant pas toujours simple : quand les cartes qui coûtent cher et qui rapportent beaucoup arrivent au début, difficile de lutter, d'autant qu'on voudrait essayer d'éviter qu'elles arrivent jusqu'aux deux emplacements fatidiques (et elles y arrivent vite), mais pour ça on a besoin de ressources, et pour prendre des ressources on est parfois forcés de se priver de bonnes cartes de la ligne centrale.

[url=http://www.trictrac.net/index.php3?id=jeux&rub=detail&inf=detail&jeu=16985][b]"Ascension"[/b][/url] est donc un bon jeu dans son genre, qui tout en restant dans le même domaine que [url=http://www.trictrac.net/index.php3?id=jeux&rub=detail&inf=detail&jeu=10483][b]"Dominion"[/b][/url], arrive à s'en distancier suffisamment pour avoir son identité propre. Les parties s'enchaînent et malgré certaines répétitions et quelques limites, on se prend au jeu et on veut recommencer. Pas un grand jeu, mais sans aucun doute un bon jeu.

I think this improves on the original in several ways. First of all, the art is much better and more compelling in my mind, especially the new art for the basic cards. Second, combat and money are balanced more effectively with the addition of cultists and events than in any other version of the game.

Nice new board and the artwork is improving with each release. Certainly the Militia and Apprentice cards are better.

Have yet to play yet, but the added mechanics look like they will work well and I like how each release furthers the story.

UPDATE: Events and Trophies are a lot of fun and certainly add to the game. I think the game is stronger mixed with Return of the Fallen, but that might change with further plays. There is a lot of recycling constructs in order to get other things. A lot of cards are about destroying the construct to get a benefit and cards to get constructs quickly back into your hand.

Consider this a quickie when you don't have time to play Thunderstone Advance. That's not to say there's nothing original here. These card synergize nicely with each other, and yeah, the game plays in about 30 minutes. Yet, this is merely a smackdown and not an adventure.

Best with 2-3 players, 4 players it gets too random and too much downtime.

After several plays, determined that the luck factor is significant.  Once players are experienced enough, it becomes more about luck of the draw rather than strategic plays (which cards to purchase and which monsters to kill).  Each faction is good in its own way, even the Mechana (despite what others say).  Lifebound and Mechana cards rely on cards of the same type to be useful (moreso for Mechana than Lifebound), while Void and Enlightened can pretty much be purchased and used on their own for good measure.

I consider this more of a filler or warm-up game than anything else, not good for serious play.  Good for lighthearted play though.

I enjoyed Ascension, and decided to pick up this edition as my first. It is just as fun as the other Ascension versions. I love the Honor tokens, and the event variation. I haven't played it in conjunction with the other editions and promos yet. It plays well as a stand alone game. One thing I like about Ascension, it the variation and surprise of the game. Each game is different from the last without having to set up rows of sorted cards like in similar card games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Even with this expansion, Ascension is not a very good game. However, Storm of Souls improves the experience immensely so it gets a solid rating. The game no longer feels like it's on autopilot. Now we have slightly-interesting decisions, the ability to build a slightly-coherent deck, and of course much more variety. The shiny new feature here is the Events, which add fun and unfairness. Unfairness is not a problem because Ascension is about degeneracy, not balance.

RATING: 8
ASCENSION:
A deckbuilding game where you pay to draft cards from a shared center row, rather than from deep stacks a la Dominion.

SPECIFICALLY STORM OF SOULS:
While the Events are few enough that they won't always come up, they dramatically change the shape of the board. The Trophy monsters give you a benefit that can be cashed in later, and the Fate cards return that have an instant effect when they hit the center row (sometimes screwing up a combo).

Immortal Heroes ups the randomness a little bit, in one way that definitely really works and in another way I'm not sure about. The New Event cards I'm not sure about; I feel like Events are more meaningful when they stay around a few turns instead of vanishing after only one or two. The Soul Gems, however, are kind of like the Dreamscape, but instead of a handful of chances to get a very strong effect they give you many chances to get a small effect. The net effect is still increased chaos, but it's at a manageable level.

+ Apprentice Edition center deck

One of my favourite games (thanks to the ios version for making me discover this pearl). A good alternative to dominion, with an immersive theme too. The design as a real identity (then you'll love it or hate it). Ascension as got a debrided mechanism, permitting to the players violent combos... too violent? Ascension doesn't revolutionize the deckbuilding games, but some innovations like the energy or the soul gems (if you buy expansions) are refreshing. Nevertheless, A recuring default is the preparation : If by exemple you play with the base game and one expansion, the pile of central cards is already too big and not easy to mix up... and at the end of the game, too long to sort out.

Really cool to see how the system was tweaked in this new block, leading to a deck with mechanically familiar play but refreshingly novel strategy & tactics.  And I love love [i]love[/i] the fact that the designers are keeping things constrained in discrete blocks (big box + small box).  Sure, you can use every card ever produced in one monstrous Frankendeck, but they're designed and tested to work best as separate story arcs.

As [thing=463]Magic[/thing] pros they've distilled the best things from the Mother Game:  discrete blocks of cards designed to work well together, deck building, throwing cool combos.  The result is a high so sharp and pure it's like freebasing a Black Lotus.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (August 2013)

Ok light game. I like the new cards and the new mechanics (Event, Trophy and Fanatic cards) as they add some interesting decisions without any significant complexity. Sill it isn’t a deep game by any means. The art is great but I dislike the tactical nature of the game (lots of uncontrollable luck). In general I dislike Deck builder games in which the card offering is variable. You can’t plan ahead and the winner is decided by luck (If the card I need/want is in the offering when it is my turn). I also miss that the game has no buy limitations making this a very simple game. Still Storms of Souls is an entertaining game.

In conclusion, I feel Dominion is the better game by a mile but I play Ascension from time to time. I think it is the best tactical deck building game out there and it is a welcome addition as the base game need the additional cards to continue to be enjoyable.

I can't believe how much better this game has gotten after combining 2 more expansions.  It has rapidly jumped into position as one of my favorite games, especially for 2 or 3 players.  

With the additional cards, the deck dynamics are just so much more interesting.

Ascension Year Two Collectors Edition Game

RATING: 9
Ascension is, hands down, my favorite DBG and my most played tabletop game in general. This set in particular is my favorite full-size release as well. It introduces some more interesting gameplay mechanics that get players more involved but also throws in a healthy dose of chance. It should be noted that all of the sets are stand-alone and compatible with each other, though I've found that Chronicles of the Godslayer (the original release of Ascension) doesn't play as smoothly alongside the later sets. Throwing in all the promos makes for a lot of chaotic fun too! I definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys fantasy card games.

Apart from a couple of new and nifty mechanics, like events and the new zealot punching-doll that enables you to use them to greater benefit, Storm of Souls enables game-winning combos apart from Mechana Constructs and generally provides a more demanding battlefield than the original game, both regarding rule density and tactical decisions during your turn.

Ascension remains one of the very, very few Dominion reworks that really feels different and not just weaker than its inspiration. Its main strength is the good balance of lottery and planning, and a secondary benefit of the fate deck approach instead of a layout of available cards is that there is no setup at all.

Good game. I like it about the same as Ascension: Chronicle of the Godslayer (so see my comments on that game).

I think the trophy monsters are a nice edition and add some strategy.  The event cards are also good, especially as they add help to their chosen factions.

Not a fan of the Fate mechanic. It requires players to do things during the middle of opponents turns, and generally interrupts the flow of the game.  Overall I find it a distracting addition to an otherwise relaxing game.  UPDATE:  I'm fine with the Fate mechanic.  It is different, and takes getting used to, but it does some pretty cool stuff (and compared to some things they added later, the Fate mechanic is fairly tame).

A lot to like here. I like the weird new mechanics for the Mechana cards. The trophy cards are great. In general, things are excellent. I am not sure that I like it as an expansion to CoG that much though. And I wish the events had more variety and impact -- there. Are whole games I want to discard the heretic but have no opportunity.

RATING: 10
What a superb game.

I'd played maybe 30-40 games of the original on my phone before trying SoS, and SoS is even better. It adds a lot of depth, variety, and strategy without adding any cruft.

The first time I played SoS, I played six two-player games in the same night. And rated it a 10, something I almost never do out of the gate and don't do often in general (it's my third 10 at the moment).

It's addictive, and setup and tear-down are so easy -- a real breath of fresh air compared to Dominon -- that it's hard not to want to play it again immediately.

I like tactical games that feature a good dose of luck when -- and this is important -- they don't take too long. Like Kingdom Builder, Ascension hits that sweet spot perfectly for me. You don't have a strategy going in, but your first few acquisitions give you one to pursue. You have to think on your feet, and you're constantly weighing things -- often multiple things about every decision point.

What might flip if I buy this? Should I fight that monster, or buy that card first? What's my opponent working on? Would I rather have that mechana construct I need or keep him from getting another lifebound hero? It's jammed full of interesting things to think about.

And I love the art. I've always loved the art. I see why others might not like it, but Sabee's style is perfect for this metaphysical, oddball fantasy world. (I also dig that so much of that world is implied rather than stated outright; it's a nice layer of depth you can appreciate or ignore without impacting the game).

The first big expansion to the game. Adds A LOT of great new center row cards. The major mechanic change is the new trophy monster and events. Both of them work quite well and give you a little more to think about. Also there are lots of nice new constructs to play with. As with most of these expansions it's hard to find flaws when the game moves so smoothly. Each expansion just seems to make the game a little better.

I like the event cards that create windows of crazy meta-gaming, although some events are definitely more interesting than others.  Trophy monsters make the monster killing strategy more interesting.  And I like how constructs are more of a ebb and flow strategy now, as that huge lines of constructs in the previous set got unweildy.

This seems superior to the previous set except with dealing with new players with no CCG or Deck Building experience.

Some minors twists on the original which I think are improvements: some monsters now allow themselves to be kept for a future one-off benefit, adding event cards in the deck, a new cultist type figure you can kill/gain which keys off the event cards. You'd get this over the original if faced with the choice, but no need to own both as they provide the same game-play experience, hence it gets the same rating and the same comment, namely: A quick and clean deck building game. You each start with a set deck and then have options to buy stuff or to kill stuff. The difference is that there are no decks to buy from. Instead there are only 6 cards displayed in the draft, a random mix of cards to buy and cards to kill, drawn from the the one central deck, so as your turn comes around, you get what you get and you don't get upset. Which makes for a more random deck build, but I actually enjoy (and may end up preferring) the unpredictability. Some turns you might get nothing, others there's some decent choices to be made. The stuff to kill are monsters and you get instant rewards (and opponents may be forced to discard stuff) and the stuff you buy could be heroes (which give any variety of purchase / kill power when you draw them back into your hand to play) and constructs (which once you draw and play stays out and generates good stuff each turn). Generally monsters and heroes get you VPs, constructs less so, so there's a choice there on which way to go. The game is easy to teach and it's quick to get up and going (an advantage over the others), but it's more random, sure. The overall variety from game to game may be lower (without the huge variety of card types that Dominion and Thunderstone provide) but it's perhaps made up for by having variety of deck thrust upon you intra-game.

Adds more cards, and some variation. Doesn't really make that much of a difference but variation. Variation is good though, I enjoy the "live" games with everything more than the iPhone play with only the base game. 

The event cards is neat, but it's difficult to remember when they change. You read the fate when you kill your Fanatic, but forget that the trophy changes when a new event arrives!

Trophies is also a new neat function.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This expansion adds events (cards that stick around for a long time and provide bonuses, often geared toward specific factions), trophies (monster cards that they keep upon defeat, and can turn in for a bonus whenever they like), and the fanatic (a new persistent monster that costs 3 to defeat and has a trophy text that's defined by the current event card).  While having the 3-cost persistent monster was a nice additional option every turn, I'm not sure that this expansion really delivered on bang for the buck for its additional complexity.  While I'm sure expert players will have no trouble digesting it all, I don't think it really added much to the game, and the events were something you constantly had to remember and account for.  The events stuck around for a really long time, too, perhaps skewing the game to someone who happened to be pursuing an aligned strategy.  I did like the extra card variety, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Definitely more meaty than the previous sets and probably the best overall ascension block period. It's not my favorite, but it's mechanically so solid. It definitely needs more plays as I still have yet to really sink my teeth into this one even though I have over 30 plays of it. Most seem to be sporadic though and far apart. I think this is the set that finally convinced me that I really need to keep an eye on Ascension as a whole.

A deck-building game; it's like a thematic [thing=36218][/thing], but without action/buy restriction and without any strategy at all. The game is just tactics, as the card pool is random and depends on whatever is available at a time. You have no clue in general what will come up next and can't plan a proper plan. It's clearly inferior to [thing=36218][/thing], for me.

Compared to Chronicle of the Godslayer: cards have better artwork, but gameplay is a bit less fun. Although there are ton of combos possible and generally the gameplay is a bit deeper it is also the problem of this game: the turns take more time and too much downtime is added due that. But in its own right it´s still a good game.

Honestly I don't know how to rate expansions. I usually give them the same score as the base game unless they actually improve the game significantly. But if I go all in on a game and get all the expansions at the time I get the base game it can be hard to see how it improves things. 

I don't think I would play Ascension without at least one expansion in play. So that taken into account I would say the expansion improves somewhat the base game. I'd give the base game a 6 and with the expansions a 7 or 8.

Played this game a ton on my iPhone and loved every minute of it.  Quick and fun with a great interface, a terrific smartphone game.

Acquired a physical copy as well, and can't say as I've been as enamored.  Playing with other people inherently adds playtime taking it from a filler experience to a sit-down game, and the depth isn't really there to support the longer time commitment.  The game can be very random too, and a few lucky (or unlucky) draws in a row can decide a game.

It's a decent deckbuilder and a good change of pace from Dominion, but I don't see myself getting this to the table too often.

A good standalone expansion, introduces events and incorporates fate effects from Return of the Fallen. Utterly changes the engines you normally build with constructs, making for a very different play than Chronicles, but surely does some interesting stuff if you start pooling them.

There isn't much to say here that I haven't said in my comments for the original release of the game (since apparently renamed from Ascension: Chronicle of the Godslayer to Ascension: Deckbuilding Game). Return of the Fallen is the second mainline release in the Ascension line and the only other one I have acquired (there have been several other subsequent releases, but I'm not especially interested despite my adoration of the system). It is more complex and there is an alternate set of militia and apprentice cards, as well as new art for the mystic and heavy infantry that I feel are better overall. My wife prefers Chronicle, but I prefer Storm, they certainly [i]feel[/i] different while still maintaining that wonderful silky feel that the Ascension system brings to the deckbuilding arena.

RATING: 8
I think this expansion adds a lot of depth to the base game. The diversification between the different factions continues and new after some initial rounds the decisions start to be really interesting. 
There are a lot of smart touch to the design what makes this possible: draw & discard/banish mechanisms, the unite ability by green, the appearance of some 7-cost heroes, etc. I especially like, how you should formulate your turn when you have some cards in hand which enable you to draw/discard/banish/peak multiple cards in a row. 
Unfortunately the events are not that much inspired and even if you combine this only with the base game, they will come out only rarely. 
The graphic design is still a hit or miss, I'm on the miss side, but slowly you get accustomed to it. 
I like the tactical nature of Ascension much more than the static offer what Dominion is all about and with the added depth of this card-pool the game got even better then before. 
I 99,9% play this on the IPad, I strongly prefer that to the tabletop version.

My favorite deck-builder so far! With the other players buying up the cards you wanted, you have to adapt your strategy on the fly, so it's not for people who like to plan three steps ahead. This makes me happy!

These people Ripped off Magic the Gathering mechanics, abilities, themes, and art style, then puked them onto the format of Dominion and Marvel Legendary.

As a gamer and a designer, I have never seen such blatant plagiarism and unoriginal work. This game was kickstarter- no wonder. Because they stole from everyone else. AND its not fun, boring, derivative, and ugly.

What a rip off. Lame unplayable hype. Garbage, of the lowest nth degree.

I did not notice while playing this game how awful it was... that crept up on me over the last few months.

Someone recently asked me if I wanted to play and I had a physical gag reflex.

If youve never played TCGs, strategy games, or deck building games, this may be fun for a few goes. But: you are missing out on much better games by wasting your time with this one.

I won the game way too easily. Beat Zack, the other players were inconsequential. Like 120 points, 50 pnt spread. Used constructs, mostly mechanoids, but stayed with purely constructs.

This Game sucks. I have many good reasons to support that statement. Many. Will share a few.

Left out all the wonderful icons, colors, and graphic representations that make Dominion, Legendary, and MTG great games that are easy to play after a while.

No card ability or type icons. ALL TEXT. ENDLESS TEXT. Must read every single cards full text over and over. Shit game.

100% stolen format of Dominion. 75% stolen abilities from Dominion.

75% stolen idea, art, and style of MTG.

50% stolen mechanics and abilities form Legendary.

Do not bother playing this if you are into good games, period.

A nice addition to the Ascension card pool overall. The mechana constructs are generally too weak, the banish effects offer less interesting decision making, as taking them doesn't sacrifice nearly as much early game, the lifebound are much stronger, and there are a few really powerful void cards. Except for mechana, the constructs are generally more interesting in SoS than in CoG.

RATING: 8
Pros:
- amount and diversity of cards guarantees replayability
- with evenly skilled players, the game is so close you cannot drop a single victory point
- (sincere!) I LIKE THE ARTWORK!?
- the turn goes quickly around the table, even with 4 players

Cons:
- not as easy to take with you as Star Realms
- when you have too many rounds with bad buying options, the game can drag out a bit

Got to try this out yesterday and I like the new cards, but the events are so few that the odds of them coming up when mixed in with the other sets is miniscule.  I wouldn't say this set is necessary, but it adds some new card interactions to an already good game.

Ascension does away with the one thing that plagues all deckbuilders – the tedious set-up and tear down – by incorporating all cards into a single deck. Also, with no restrictions on how many cards may be played down or bought in a turn, Ascension is the least restrictive in terms of rules.  However, it’s also very light in terms of strategy, as players can’t really plan ahead not knowing what cards are coming up next. The factions are quite neat, and they all have distinctive characteristics which work well amongst cards from its faction, and with other factions. While it doesn’t really provide a complete deckbuilding experience, Ascension serves as a pretty good filler when you don’t feel like setting up piles and piles of cards. This is my entry point to the Ascension franchise, and it works well as a standalone game.

Played it solo a lot and thought it was great.

I was pleasantly surprised by how much I like Ascension, since I'm not much of a fantasy gamer at all, even in deckbuilding games, which I enjoy.  I'll take the original for its balance, originality, and speed of play, but I wouldn't sure down a game with this expansion either.

RATING: 6
The chief difference with this set is it adds the new Event mechanic as well as some polished up language and minor rules tweaks.

The comments I made for Return of the Fallen apply universally here as well.  New mechanics breathe new life into a game like this one and are welcome.  I even like that the old standbys (Apprentice/Militia/Mystic/Heavy Infantry) get new artwork.  As always the prevalent overabundance of luck means certain card flips and Events that a player can take advantage of on their turn can hand them the game early but I still have fun playing this occasionally.

More of the same. The biggest change from previous Ascension releases is the addition of trophy monsters, which are kept after being defeated and can be banished for a bonus. There are also several global environment cards seeded in the deck; when one is turned up, it applies a persistent effect (such as "the first hero played each turn is Lifebound") until it is replaced.

Several cards in the set don't play well if combined with Chronicle of Godslayer or Return of the Fallen because the supply of environment cards and trophies is too few.

Great deck-building game. It has pure rules and can be played very fast but the theme and illustrations are making this a very interesting piece to have. Rules are the same in all Ascensions games and small things are adding a differtent flavour to every one. Here you can find events that can change the feel of the game a little and boost some types of cards in their natural way of gameplay.

While the game can be played in 4 players, it's still have the sweetspot when you play it in 2. Nontheless playing Ascension in 3 or 4 is still a good fun.

[thing=108784][/thing] is an expansion that adds a huge lot of cards (200) to the base game, which makes it more variable and, sure, adds more luck in draw. Still, the possibilities and replay value that come with the expansion much surpass the luck issue.

Events are fun and, along side the addition of the Fanatics, is great. The many cards enhance the deck building factor - specially due to the amount of cards that allow banishing others.

For those that like the base Ascension but want more from the experience, [thing=108784][/thing] is a very good way to go.

Ascension is a deck-building game similar to Dominion. Main differences in Ascension are that victory points are not interfering your hand (you are collecting gems instead), Hero cards (actions) are limitless and the choice of cards varies, which causes more time to be used for reading text on the cards.

It's more ascension. Ascension doesn't really reward my completionist itches the way other games do. Expansions don't add to or supplement the base game so much as replace it. On one level this is good. I'll just keep the base set because it's easy to teach. The expansions aren't any worse, but they add complexity without being better.

Have only played this as a standalone.  The events are not that big of a deal, although adding the fanatic for a 3-cost kill makes odd-value strength cards a little bit better deal.  As a whole, there seems to be a greater fighting focus with this deck, though that may have been a sample size issue for me.  The events are add a small amount of variability without much rules overhead, though they are by no means essential

If you're looking to buy one Ascension game and are wondering which, I'd give the edge to [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/69789/ascension-chronicle-of-the-godslayer]the original[/url].  That said, this is close enough that you'll still get enjoyment out of this.

RATING: 6
With this expansion (yeah, yeah, base game, [i]whatever[/i]), Ascension gets a little bit fiddlier, but also allows for more strategy.  The event cards and the Fanatic allow players to have more of a multiple-card effect, like in Dominion, so shorter-term tactics going toward a longer-term strategy pay off more here than in the base game alone.  The games will take a little longer, I think, considering the new tactics that the event cards allow, but it's still a 60-minutes-or-less game, so it's a good trade-off.

On the negative side, the cards in this game are completely different from the cards in the previous two Ascension games.  I sleeve my cards, so it's not a huge issue with me, but even sleeved, I can tell a difference in the heft of the cards.  So be forewarned on that issue, especially if you're not a card sleever.

RATING: 5
Simplified Star Fleet Battles sub-light game with leters instead of SSDs.  (Instead of a pictoral representation of a ship with 12 armor boxes, you might have 12 letter "A"s (for Armor).  Strike a letter instead of a box.  Along with much less rules, this makes fleet battles far easier than Star Fleet Battles.  Individual one-on-one battles left something to be desired.

It wasn't my cup of tea because back then, I had no realized that fleet battles in SFB were impractical.  Therefore, I traded it away and never looked back.

RATING: 7
My rating is base on the 1st edition of the game which I play extensively during high school, nice fun and fast game, is a classic on it's own right. I have Starfire I and II. It is easy to learn (compared to Star fleet battles). Never get to Starfire III empires which is the campaign game, too much rules at that point already. The one line ship characteristic code is sweet, though sometime I feel it is single dimensioned. The various weapons type make the game shine. I love Starfire II (the carrier game, not the new edition) better, since it feel more meat with carriers and fighters, plus the firing arc make movement essential and critical.

Another really good tactical space game.  This one you can design ship the way you want it.  The campaign games are real fun if you combine it with exploration and colonization.

I have all 4 editions... I dislike the 4th intensely. 1st and third are the better ones, IMO...

Nothing like taking 30 ships on a side and being done in under an hour, yet still haivng tracked internal damage to specific systems!

RATING: 6.5
Simple space combat game.  Tactics can be a bit basic but the easy flow of the system and the range of weapons compansates.  Jewel in the crown is the excellent ship design rules.

Expansions add extra complication which detracts from the game's greatest strength - simplicity.

Refers to early edditions, haven't tried later incarnations.

RATING: 8
Can't be beat for quick, simple space combat.  The ability to design your own units is a huge plus.  Can become a tedious dice-fest in very large fleet battles.  Recently dropped the rating from a 10 not because my opinion of the game has changed but because the rating felt more realistic.

Not bad, not great. Alot of games are better with fewer rules. Scaled down Star Fleet Battles in a way. Its really nothing too special. I used to have all the modules.

I bought this back in the days when I'd play Star Fleet Battles regularly, it was REALLY nice to be able to setup and play a complete game in less time than it took to play a single SFB turn ;-)

I fall sleep several time when I'm reading the rulebook, it is just boring.

The game rules is not bad but IMO it is outdated.

A revisd verison with new graphic and simplified rules are needed.

I should say honestly that I do not have the rules any longer. Only the Miniatures.  The rules totally SUCKED!  I currently use them for auxillary type ships in Full Thrust.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Totally forgot about this one.  I think this was the game where ships' systems were represented by a string of letters which you crossed out as the ship took hits, so the hits "walked" their way down the string of letters.  An ugly generic game from a time of ugly generic games. No comparison to Star Fleet Battles.

It seems really hard to make a sci fi or fantasy game, not based on a well known book or movie, which is at all interesting.

This was great back in the day. Whereas Star Fleet Battles (by the same company - reviewed under that game) was great at simulating single ship combat, Starfire was awesome at simulating fleet actions. The ability to design your own ship also a great feature. The scenarios were a little contrived, but you could always make up your own.

I found this game after playing [gameid=1589] (SFB), and reading about it in Nexus Magazine.  I liked it because it was simpler to play and setup than SFB.  I loved SFB, but sometimes I wanted to play someting that didn't require me to memorize a binder and play all weekend, and Starfire fit the bill.  I really love the original version of this game because of its simplicity, and the future history scenarios are a great theme to this game.  

I own the Pocket Version (and expansions) and the Second Edition Boxed Version (and expanisons).  I prefer the Boxed Edition before Fighter Rules as my favorite version/scenarios for the game.

Plays for all my versions of Starfire are recorded here as the original game system (including [gameid=20432]).

One of the best space games that I played. I was at a friends house and he was duping some japanese anime for me ( in 1983 or 84) and I saw this on a desk
 " it was a present from my mom, it doesnt excite me" so I was able to borrow it off him as long as I didnt unpunch the counters. So i used the maps from my copy of Airforce and used those counters with designations written in pencil on the back! Taught my 9 and 12 year old brothers to play, had a blast, then we got into Starfleet battles.......

The system for taking and recording damage is a stroke of genius that should be replicated in every space combat game. The movement system is a very good idea in theory, but becomes extremely tedious in large games.

Ah, the original Starfire.  In its heyday, this was probably *the* best mass combat starship boardgame written.  These days, it's got a lot of competition (Starmada springs to mind) and the more recent editions seem to have lost sight of the old KISS principle...but the original I'm always up for a game of.  Shame hardly anyone around here plays anymore.

One of the 1st "micro-games" I ever purchased--& a complicated one at that!  Now, mind you, I was in 5th grade when I picked it up (I had played many AH games at this point) & I wanted a sci-fi themed strategy game.  So, with it being a micro-game, I thought:  "How hard can it be?"  Boy, did I find out--the print in the rulebook was as "micro" as the game.  Very complicated at the time.  If I still had it I'd give it a second shot.

Got this and SFB in 1984 when I lived in Jacksonville, FL. I was 14 at the time and SFB was complicated as hell next to Starfire so I had a hard time finding anyone willing to play SFB, Starfire was simpler and quicker.

I actually played the TFG edition of these rules a few times and was thrilled by the idea of the unique notation to describe each ship. That was when I was a teen.  

After the military I purchased the Galactic Starfire version and I think that the game became very versatile but a bit too complex for me to enjoy.

A game that I had, it did not survive my mid 1990s downsizing, thought I had played it enough and now wish that I kept it. The abstract simplicity worked great as your 'ship' was a series of letters with each letter representing a different function [power source, weapons, armour and shields], allowing you to custom build your ship and fleet. I do miss this game. The game took a bit to set up, but, played well and quickly too.

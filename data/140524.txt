A coop that we kinda broke on our first play.  Needs some revisions to balance it further.  It works, but not very well.  Interesting concept, though.

No rating yet, but the box size is so inconvient. I don't know what to do with it. It's taking up so much space. I actually hope I hate it so I can sell it and not miss it even a little.

RATING: 8
Perfectly designed game. Yes, it is expensive, but the puzzle aspect of the game and the strong cooperation make it a fantastic game.

Hopefully the Dice Tower does not hurt this game too much.

I love the progression of the game as well. The more you get to the outer ring, the faster the game goes. 

It really shines with 4 players. It took us almost 45 minutes the last time to regroup again after the first catch by the guards. Awesome, awesome game!

Especially the real time difficulty advancers bring the game higher on my list.

Some will consider the board a gimmick, but it's the reason the game plays as smoothly as it does.  This is an "escape" game done right.

RATING: 8
Really fun game, that seems a bit simple at first, but greatly ramps up in difficulty as more modifiers are added. Only complaint is the mini quality is a little lacking.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Lots of downtime if you get sent back to your cell.  Too many rounds had either way too many things that needed to be done or being stuck with extra moves that couldn't be used for anything necessary or useful.

I played as the "brawler" role (or whatever it's called in this game) but the way the mintaurs and loctae spawn and move there was never a chance for me to kill more than one at a time, so the power was wasted.

I am really glad I decided to pick this game up regardless of the mixed reviews. I admit my wife and I watched two tutorials after reading the confusing rule book. However now that we know the mechanics we can't get enough, every game is different and there are countless stipulations you can add to make it more challenging. Yes, the box is huge and oddly shaped and yes the rule book is horrible but the game itself is solid and now one of our favorites.

rated a 1 because I will never play this.  When a 2014 date is announced and it hasn't even been KS'ed yet in 2016 tells me that the game is already full of problems.  Pass

I pre-ordered this on first day of KS campaign, 19MAR2016.  It successfully funded on 05APR2016 and is due OCT 2016.  It arrived 17 OCT 2016.

This is the only game I've rated without actually playing, because:

I'm agreeing with Apostolis Koutsikos (tokou) who said, 

"- This is a counter-vote!!! -

I've no exerience of the game but I'm rating this a 10 to offset what I feel is another's unjustified rating of 1 over a small issue. I do like the artwork so far, though. "

A rater thought he saw something which didn't exist and may not even be published in the game and gave it a 1, so I'm trying to balance that with my preliminary rating (I'll probably change it after I actually play the game, but I hope not).

This is a counter-counter-counter vote! Because counter-counter voting a counter vote is categorically uncool! But I don't want to sway the ratings, so I'm slicing it right down the middle. This makes sense.

[url=http://www.techuser.net/klondikeprob.html]Cooperative games are not games, they are puzzles. And whether I win or lose against a random inanimate/unintelligent algorithm, I am left feeling unsatisfied. I'd rather play a One versus All or a Team versus Team game. [/url]

I don't think this is a bad game, but it's not for me.

I don't like a lot of co-op games, and I don't care for lots of fiddliness, especially when I don't care about the outcome.

This game will probably be a smash hit for some people, but I don't want to play it again.

RATING: 4
Temporary player elimination while captured really brings this down. As does being captured at the final threat level; Too much time is spent rescuing and manipulating the board.

I will give it another go, but it seems more likely to drop than rise in rating...

The base game I rate an 8.  It's as good as Pandemic, but can suffer from AP and alpha-player syndrome.  After playing with some of the Difficulty Enhancers in the rulebook, I rated it a 9.  These Enhancers really improve the tension and pressure of the experience, while not allowing for one player to over analyze or run the whole team.  Great co-op game!

It's like a souped up version of Burgle Bros or Room 25. The spinning board works well and the modular variants do a lot to mix up gameplay and keep it somewhat fresh. However, I did not keep it because it's too expensive for what it gives you. For $100+, standards are higher. Give me a campaign, beautiful components... something to justify the cost.

Played solo, it was utterly boring.  Do the obvious thing, then see what random stuff will be drawn.  Repeat.  I doubt it will be much better with more players.

RATING: 7
Fun coop game that uses some new (to me) mechannisms to create an escape puzzle.  Board is very cool and the game play is smooth and not to difficult to adopt.  Have only played a single game on the easiest level so far and look forward to alternative difficulties and even a head to head mode.

Updaye:  Have played a couple more times and still enjoy it.  Not an every week game but several times a year this will be fun to bring out.

:) Tough but certainly winnable
:) Well done, low luck AI that you can outsmart
:) Moving board works well
:) Offers a 1 vs all mode for 5p

:soblue: Giant but necessary box
:soblue: Player aids needed to be better
:soblue: 2 tiles have similar art and abilities. Just needed an icon.
:soblue: Price is high though it can be found for reasonable price

Definitely not worth the MSRP of $150. I got the game for $30 + shipping and felt that the price point was about right. The first play was initially pretty confusing, as expected, and we originally thought it was too easy. Then we realized we had been missing some rules and the game got much more difficult.

The plastic figures have almost no detail and the box is massive. I don't think the insert will hold sleeved cards. I'm not really sure where to put some of the components once they are punched out, so they are underneath the game board in the box.

I will update my review as I play more because I don't think one play is enough to really judge the game.

Unsure...I like the basic premise and executuion but it seems rather "rough around the edges". We lost our first game, because monsters twice randomly spawned on my character - so no amount of planing could have avoided this. Also, it was very little fun just sitting around for 15+ mins waiting fot the other players to come back and rescue me from the cell.

The Daedalus Sentence has got some dang good stuff going for it — great pacing, an excellent way to foresee and manipulate the movement of the station — but it's not quite enough.

While the game is above average (not great) the narrative and tension is tremendous. Lots of fun and putting a timer on it makes it edgy and tense. Very well done for what it is.

Great co-op that plays quick and with tense actions and decision points. Get over the two biggest dislikes for this game which are size and price. Size can't be dealt with given the board mechanical design, but the bits are excellent quality. Price can be dealt with by purchasing it at a significant discount online while you can (2017). From a co-OP game standpoint the game is great fun and in the "solid 7" range.  Disregard morons who've rated it a "1".  From a game collector standpoint, don't miss having a copy while you can find it.

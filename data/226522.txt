Thema sehr gut eingefangen. Schönes neuer Mechanismus der Räume. Empfehlenswert (auch wenn es gefühlt leichter war als andere EXIT-Games.

Also the second game of this series that I've played was great (first : "The Secret Lab" ). Maybe even slightly better, though I would not recommend it as introductory play to this series. It's definitely more challenging (and also a bit more thematic).

[url=http://fortressat.com/articles-analysis/2767-idiots]Cooperative games are not games, they are puzzles. And whether I win or lose against a random inanimate/unintelligent algorithm, I am left feeling unsatisfied. I'd rather play a One versus All or a Team versus Team game. [/url]

Eu gosto de sentir a experiência de um consumismo responsável enquanto jogo, ou seja, jogos que jogarei dezenas de vezes e/ou que depois ainda posso vender, trocar ou doar.

My favorite Exit game so far (played the first and second game).
Points: 9 / 2 hours / 0 help cards. 

We didn't need any help cards. We could solve  every puzzle/riddle without help but for that we needed a little bit more time. Great theme, great new ideas, great illustrations.

Unsere Spielgruppe besteht wirklich aus ein paar cleveren Ratefüchsen- ich würde sagen, wir sind auf Zack! Dieser Tiel war aber einfach zu schwierig für uns. Benötigten 90 Minuten und viele Hinweise. Schade, sehr unbefriedigend.

The family has enjoyed a couple of escape rooms so we thought this might be good fun for a stay at home puzzle. The phone app serves as a timer and will read the instructions out for you, but other than that it just provides incessant choo choo sounds that go on your nerves - so we turned the sound off after a couple of minutes.

It's hard to stay in your chair as four people pore over clues on cards and the inspector's notebook, but my 11 and 14 year old took charge and soon had us powering through. Two puzzles tripped us up for a bit and although we weren't trying to rush the game we wanted to keep it enjoyable and so succumbed to the temptation of the tip deck for the top couple of clues - twice - but other than that the kids found it not too difficult, but a good challenge. There was no need to destroy any bits - a notebook and a bit of visualisation are all you need (okay, I did dash to the printer and copied two pages), so the game will be passed on to the nephews for them to enjoy on their holidays.

I don't think I like this type of puzzle if you're going to rush through it without absorbing and appreciating the storyline, the characters, the artwork. It's a puzzle to think about over a couple of beers and with a full compliment of players - feeding off each other and having a good social experience. So I suggest relaxing, enjoying and not reaching for any tip cards unless you're really, really stuck, and make an evening out of it. No reason why this can't be played with more than four either - you wouldn't want too many people crowding the table, but don't baulk at the game if you happen to have five interested participants.

At the end of the day, I've done one and that'll do me. Life has enough cryptic puzzles to solve and I was a little disappointed that our original inspector didn't ask the right questions of his suspects, or follow up questions before handing the job over to us to solve.

Looks like a neat multiple-level push-your-luck game with some interesting decisions. Push-your-luck bidding, followed by push-your-luck die-rolling in order to accomplish your push-your-luck card collecting goals.

Kicsit komolyabb, mint a Mow. De nem nagyon. Élményre is kb. annyit adott. A licites-kártyaszerző mechanizmus tetszik, de nagyon nagy a szerencse szerepe, ezt tovább fokozza, hogy a kombók irreálisan erősek. Kell egy kis érzék a licithez, (vagy egy jó képlet:)).
A csipeszek nagy sikert arattak:)

Néha játszom vele szívesen.

Not the best of the Zoch series. The betting mechanism for turn order slows down the game. Also, the last player often times gets a benefit, unless black sheep are in the mix.

Yet another good dice game!  This one offers some different decisions than many others I've played, and allows you to control how much risk you want to take on.  The problem is, if you don't take enough risks and play it safe all of the time, you'll probably lose.

I found this a lot of fun as you collect different ship by trying to roll your pre-chosen target on three dice. The clever thing is the three dice are all different. A D8, D10 and D12. If you manage your target on your first roll you take three sheep cards. If not keep a dice and roll again but now you can only take two cards and so on. 1 Play.

Only played a couple games with kids, but seems pretty solid for those who like dice games. It's one of the many new "roll, lock, re-roll" 3 times type games. Not sure if the market really needs this many, but I like the Zoch line of games. But unlike games like the new Ra Dice game, there isn't much difference between beginning/middle late game. But I do like the bid for turn order thing, where your bid is then used a goal you need to roll to to get stuff, and the fewer rolls it takes to reach your goal, the more stuff you get (sheep = vp). And as usual, there's also stuff you don't want (black sheep = -vp). There are a few sheep whose value depends on how many you have, in a very weird way, which really is intended to add a memory element, and I'm not a big fan of memory elements, so that's not the part I like. I'm also not reallu sure about dog scoring. At least in a 2p game there seems to be way too many dogs, and it really comes down to who has the single bone at the end, which you can't really plan for. Having said all that, I really like the core mechanic.

Deceptively deep.  Do I want to bid higher, to go first, only to have my plans dashed by bad rolls?  Or do I want to try to bid a little lower, try to make the target a little easier, and fail at picking up the low hanging fruit when my rolls come up crap?  The best is when the game incents you to try to fail the die roll, only to have that effort fail.  Good fun.

RATING: 7
Another Yahtzee-type game where you roll to win cards from a group.  Much like To Court The King or Airships in that regard.  Here its done lighter and the catch is you have to predict your roll before rolling (d8, d10, d12).  The cards you win score points and/or give modifiers.  Pretty fun, quick, light, one of the better games in this genre.  There's more to consider than you might think, as you sometimes aim to hit your bid on the 2nd or 3rd rolls in order to stick people with bad cards.

No longer care as much for this one and I'll likely have it up for sale/trade. The game goes on for too long for the gambling/bluffing aspect in the game. Hasn't aged well but I can't complain as I got 10 plays out of the game. 

FIRST IMPRESSION: Fun little dice game which plays quickly.  You bid a number which you then have up to 3 chances to match or go over with dice rolls.  Sheep cards are available which give points or take away points and also potentially modify the dice roll.

Non adatto a chi come me non ama i giochi di fortuna, tutto ruota intorno a tre dadi (D8-D10-D12). Poi però c'è una componente di valutazione del rischio e scelta 'strategica' che rendono sipatica una partita. 
Un veloce e simpatico party-game con poche (non pochissime) regole... Gioco comunque apprezzabile per semplicità, il gioco si lascia giocare e rigiocare senza grosse pretese, la lunghezza della partita (15/20 minuti) lo rende ideale come filler.

This is quite an underrated game in my opinion.  I'm guessing its because some of the rules are a little nuts (especially the scoring) - but hey - it is called WOOL RULES, there's a clue that the rules are gonna be a bit crazy.

I think it successfully combines a push-your-luck game with a blind bidding auction where you can also take steps to mitigate the luck factor.

RATING: 2
Awful. Guilty of the flaw of so many Euros: convoluted scoring to give an appearance of strategic and tactical depth.

It's a set collection game with a push-your-luck element. However, the push-your-luck part is incredibly random, and worse, too arithmetic for such a light game.

Avoid at all costs at large  numbers of players. With large numbers, it's the same reason why you don't play Yatzee with 6; the downtime is atrocious because all you do while waiting for your turn is to watch your opponent's roll dice.

A interesting mix of push your luck, with some set collecting and a little memory.  Don't let the cutesy artwork fool you, this has a bit of cutthroat aspect too as you try to stick others with the black sheep of that third 370 sheep or to steal that bone.  A lot going on for such a simple game.  It does have some chaos and luck which can make it fun as long as you don't take it too seriously.

Nagyon szép a játék kivitelezése, a kártyákon az állatok nagyon aranyosak, a csipesz pedig, ami a licitálásra használatos rögtön megvett. Sajnos több jót nehéz a játékról elmondani. Vaklicit, kockadobálás, lapka véletlenszerű felhúzás. Ennél nagyobb szerencsefaktorú játék kevés van. Szóval, aki ezt elviseli az egy aranyos játékkal találkozhat, de nyerés kevéssé a játékoson fog múlni.

RATING: 4
There are some nice ideas here, but there is just such an extreme level of luck that I just fail to see any desire to play this again. There is a blind bid to roll. You rely on other players rolls to determine your results (for good or for ill). If you get a turn the dice will determine whether you are helped or hurt you despite any "decisions" you make.   It is engaging in that you care what other people are doing as it ultimately controls your game, so I upgrade this to a four for the perceived lack of downtime, despite going turns without doing anything at all.  Clever, but not particularly fun.

RATING: 5
[Zoch 'Volle Wolle' 07 edition] {Dice, animal; dice-rolling, simultaneous-action, set collection; optimal 5-6p} Volle Wolle is a cute family dice game, highly luck dependent.  The novel element is rolling 3 different shaped dice (d8, d10, d12).  Players compete for the sheep cards on the table. It is more interesting with aggressive players who will frequently make high bids and compete for the player order.  Players have some control on the dice - 3 rolls, sheep card adjustment and use of wooden chips (but luck is still important).  Some players do not like the memory element but I insist that players can check their collection pile.  Decisions of taking cards are trivial, not special. Nothing really great here, but it is solidly playable.

The illustration of cards is cute, but the clips are too small for children.  I prefer bigger cards, though.

The family and poker-playing friends have enjoyed the Chicken Zock games so thought this would be a winner especially as it was more complex.

Alessandro Zucchini (Lucca Città;VOLLE WOLLE is a clever dice-game, where players try to get the most valuable sheep while trying to avoid black sheep. So you need a little luck, a portion of risk and some self-confidence because only the player, who rolled the predicted dice sum can choose from the available cards. And if you're too careful you might only get what's left over. And as mentioned above no one wants to have black sheep because they equal minus points.

I love the [thing=35508][/thing] system.  While not a strong system for simulation (can tactical games be very good at simulation?), it makes up for in game play, as it creates a stressful balance of maneuver and card management.

This one has better components than Chainmail and [thing=66533][/thing] and is on par with [thing=101539]First Bull Run[/thing].  The rules are not quite as developed (ex: cavalry cannot use 2 cards for movement points and there is no rule limiting face changes to 2 per player round) because this one pre-dated the Chainmail by 7 years.  Overall, though, a very fun game.

RATING: 8
Excellent (and cheap) way to play this famous battle, the terrain and the troops are faithfully reproduced. 
Confused manual but a lot of aids in BGG.
The material is easily playable as a sandbox, for example without cards and using fixed movements and strenght, or modifying original positions and tile numbers and creating some missions (for ex.: capture the prussian heir to the throne before he reaches an occupied castle - the heir represented by a little paper marker hidden under one prussian tile - blocking its troops and avoiding english enemy). Also some parts of the terrain can be added (ex extra trees, buildings) or ignored.

Although I really wish Phalanx Games all the best luck in the world I cannot recommend this one. The components are really outstandig, but as a traditional wargamer I'm not so fond of the square hexes. The activation system is nice, but I really don't like the cards. It's way to fuzzy.

RATING: 2
Makes me remember why I quit wargames 20 years ago. Played "short" game, which took two hours. Leaders are practically worthess, cavlary has same movement rate as infantry, Allies have no chance with French going first and no Prussians (in short game). No zones of control make it easy for units to retreat and then attack on defending player's next turn, etc.

RATING: N/A
Haven't played but to quote BGG description:
"This is the second in Phalanx's series of low complexity, historical wargames ... Beautiful components and an emphasis on playability over simulation put this squarely in the category of wargames that might appeal to a euro-gamer."

RATING: 7
Initial Impression: Phalanx adorns this game with the same high production values that gamers are accustomed to from their products. This game emphasizes tactics based on clever card play. Each card can be used for movement, combat strength, or a special ability. Tough decisions must be made ever turn on how best to use the cards. Proper use of positioning through flank and rear attacks grant combat bonuses which can't be ignored. Overall, this is a good introductory Napoleonic game which emphasizes basic tactics with almost a eurogame mechanism.

RATING: 7
Nice, if not great, game. Richard Berg produces a pretty elegant basic system by adding euro elements to a wargame, and then *almost* resists his usual instincts to continue piling useless details into it. Also has that Richard Berg trademark of feeling a bit "all over the map", having read through the rules once I had almost no conception of how the game actually works - you've got to play a turn or two to see how it goes. This is not a good thing. Still, despite the issues, I liked this game and while it's no Rommel in the Desert despite comparable, or possibly greater, complexity, it's a solid light to medium weight wargame entry.

RATING: 7
I expected this game to be another take on Battle Cry/Memoir '44/Command & Colors, but it's quite different in execution, and requires much more thoughtful play.  It's a real brain-burner, as you try to optimize your card-play.  The combat system is very "euro", and has a strong bluffing(!) element.  This allows the defender to make last-ditch efforts, which can be frustrating to an attacker, but it's costly.  There is CRUCIAL errata published that fundamentally changes gameplay; and despite the errata, the rules still have ambiguous areas.

I don't know...it's pretty cool on one hand, but sort of idiosyncratic and nonsensical on the other.

Suprisingly for a card-based wargame, this game has quite a chess-like feel to it. The physical presentation is top notch, the components sumptuous, and the situation one the classics of wargaming. Be sure to download the FAQ 1.5 here on the geek to augment the rulesbook. With two experienced players the game should go down to the last hand of the game.

I want to play it just because it looks so good.  But the gameplay is not very intuitive.  It's a game that is fun to play once you know how, but you're likely to have few people to sit down with this one.  It's a two player game with a less favorable 3 player variant.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Battles have a nice bluffing element by playing cards supporting the battle; I like the maneuvring part of the game which is very important; however, I think turning is relatively expensive, the game takes too long and follows the same patterns every time; in fact this is just a game for 2 players as the 3rd (Prussian) player has little to do; I think some rules amendments are a must, like moving the British infantry into La Haye to start the game.

RATING: 4
The system uses cards to move units across a square gridded board, then uses same cards to augment the battle values.  The counters and board are beautiful, but the cards are difficult to use as the important information cannot be seen by fanning them, to the point of being nearly unplayable.  There are two scenarios, short and full game.  The short game appears suspect - the French have more units, they are stronger units, they have more cards, and can take two of the three victory locations on the very first turn as they move first and these locations are not occupied by the British.  As of June 2003, the designer and publisher and currently arguing on Consimworld as to what the correct rules actually are.  Not a great sign.

Great Wargame. Lacks a little of action. But most things are realy thought over.
Love the Card factor in it and that their are no dice in the game!
You have to realy think things over before you play your cards and the number
of cards, cause without them...you will meet your Waterloo!

The manual could use some alterations, but with some clever thinking that is
a minor detail.

Excellent components.  Card management makes for interesting fog of war.  Unfortunately, a competent french player easily trounces even an experienced allied side.  There has been some debate about this on ConsimWorld.  If enough time is available for a match where both players switch sides, then I still think this can be a good game.  The quality of the game in general is such that I'm not giving up on it; it is a good game.  The results are just so predictable.  I would add a house rule to give the Allied player a mulligan if he does not draw at least 1 artillery card in the opening hand.  Without one, well, la Garde ne mourrera pas et elle se rendra à St Jean.

Really filling a hole in my collection. It is not that much a simulation, but a real good tactical game, although still a wargame.
A non-wargamer might have problems at the beginning or just don't like it.
What makes me rating this game so high is: no rule digging during play; barely luck-depending. To make this clear: no tables representing probabilities and no dice and modifiers will create a result between terrific and devastating – more chess-like. You know, why you win or loose. It's in your hand and no boxcars can drive me mad here ;o)

As much as we tried, we could never find a way to win as the English, as the hand size, troop quality and position of the French is so good that they control initiative until it is way too late to do anything.

It just takes too much time to play for the amount of game you get.  The short scenario will take about 3 hours, the long scenario perhaps twice that. The game mechanics create a conga line of doom where your guys constantly circle to the enemy's flank - even if they started in front of him - which really shreds the Napoleonic theme.

The game was largely unplayed for 6 years. It hit the table on three occassions. Third time was the charm. 

The rules are solid, but could be streamlined and would benefit from a once-over by a tech writer.

Although I prefer playing World War Two type hexagonal style based games. But this game is an exceptionally fine game. Very entertaining & not getting bogged down on complex rules which drives one person frustrated or simply playing it slow to avoid making mistakes. This is something to play when time is scarce & you want to have a good game. The whole game is well packaged, with superb mapboard, playing pieces & easy to learn. By all means this is for all you Napoleonic War era enthusiasts. A simple but effective way to play an all round Napoleonic era war.  I will always hold onto this game in my personal collection. Also this game is the best gift to give for any Napoleonic era fans, especially for those novice players for their introductory level.

I thought I would provide my thoughts on the facets of this wargame that please me. Obviously this is highly subjective and so I will first state that what will turn me on more than anything else are great production values. This game has them in spades.

The game is published by Phalanx and designed by Richard Berg although it is credited to Alexander S. Berg in respectful memory of the former's late son.

The board is hard-mounted and shows an abstraction of the terrain just south of Mt. St. Jean where the battle occurred. It is grand tactical in its treatment and is sub-divided into squares for movement purposes.

For games of this nature, I always use counter sleds from www.rdoxx.com and paint them in the national colours. So, at the risk of being obvious, these are not included in the game.

The pieces are made of thick 1" x 1" heavy cardboard and depict divisions and brigades. The image below is the view of the French deployment at around 11.35am. There are 19 French pieces, 17 Anglo-Allied and 14 Prussian to represent the actual troops involved. The other pieces are used as game markers. This gives a low counter density.

The pieces are marked by their brigade or divisional designations and I feel here that an opportunity to name them after their respective commanders has been missed. Below is shown Drouet d' Erlon's deployment prior to assaulting the Anglo-Allied left-centre. Wouldn't it have been better to see them named Jaquinot, Durutte, Marcognet and Quiot? This again, is personal preference as I become involved in the role-play aspect of any game I enjoy.

Large cardboard stand-up pieces are provided for Wellington and Napoleon. Poor old Blucher doesn't get a look in.

The game is card driven and a sample is shown below. The cards have a quality linen finish. Movement and battle ratings are provided on the top corners and any special effect is further illustrated at the centre.

The rules are simple and contained in a well laid out 16-page colour booklet. 

Being card-driven, each player is dealt a round of cards that dictate his or her actions using the movement points or battle points earlier mentioned. The object is to outscore one's opponent within the time limit set for the scenario. Points are awarded for gaining particular objective squares or eliminating opposing pieces.

Movement points allow you to advance a piece up to the limit on a card. Each piece has a "facing" marked by an arrow and facing is all-important as attack bonuses are obtained by hitting the flank or rear of an enemy piece. Defence bonuses are derived from occupying important "Chateaux" squares.

Some cards have special effects when used in a battle and these range from artillery barrages to cavalry charges.

The gameplay is tactical and provides enough excercise for the old grey matter without swamping the player in too much detail.

There are some anomalies in that opposing cavalry can be forced to charge a square formation but these are the same for both sides.

Whilst this is basically a two-player game, a third can take the role of the Prussians, but this player would have to be content with a minor role. I have played this solo and attempted to follow the historical course of the battle with mixed results. It has, however, never bored me and provided me with many hours of enjoyment. I love "historical" boardgames and in this case I would call it a game based on history rather than a true denoument of the battle of Waterloo.

As you can see, I enjoy having this game and can wholeheartedly recommend it.

Seems to be pretty much a cake walk for the French.  Neither I nor my usual gaming partner want anything to do with playing the Brits.  All the French have to do is block the entry points for Brit reinforcements.  Looks good, that's the only reason for getting a rating of 4, otherwise not interested in playing.

Suffers from trying to be a euro-wargame. Too much of a eurogame for wargamers, too much of a wargame for eurogamers. Which is a shame, as it fills the niche there clearly is between the two. Movement and actions are card driven. Each card can be used in multiple ways, so the trick is to know what to use each card for. Battles are resolved deterministically, so there is little chance involved (just the cards you draw for each turn). 

My only comment would be on the rules. I'd say these could be brought down to two, maybe three, pages of concise rules. Instead, you get a 16 (or so) page monster, which makes it too hard to see the simple mechanics.

Simple but fun wargame with beautiful components. Card management is an undertreated mechanic in tactical wargames, and other than Combat Commander this is my favorite CDG.

I had to make major adjustments (earlier and stronger Prussian entrance for example) to make this game more workable from an historical perspective.  This is NOT a great simulation of the battle but is fun to play and I really love the large and colorful counters.  As I get older (approaching 60) simple rules and large counters are more my speed than in my early days when I was a "monster game" geek.

Chewy game, nevertheless with great components.
I expected more and was a bit disappointed. Somehow strange.

Same wonderful components as all Phalanx games. Easy to read counters are getting more important to me all the time. We gave it a shot recently and just couldn't get into it as a Euro/wargame crossover despite or because we are long time traditional war gamers and history buffs. It could be because we have preconceptions about what is critically important in a game set in that era, Infantry formations, Grand Batteries and the general rock, paper, scissors interaction of cavalry, infantry and guns.

Ye gods the rules are confusing!  I had a difficult time figuring out the basic flow of a game turn, the very essence of the game, even after consulting the Q&A.  Fortunately I got a quick response direct from Phalanx and here on BGG.  If the rule book were written more clearly -- with the exceptions and special case rules set off from the rest of the text -- learning this game would be a snap.  'Waterloo' isn't that difficult of a game to learn, once you muddle through everything, and the flow of the gameplay is great and engrossing.  It's a tremendous card-management game that deserves more attention and a new, streamlined presentation of the rules.  Plus, it's a freakin' beautiful game to look at.

The game itself looks beautiful, all the components are very good quality.  The rules seemed a little clunky at first but after the 1st turn I started to understand it.  I enjoyed the luckless battle mechanism and found that it worked really well.  I'm now looking forward to swapping sides and playing as the French.

Had a couple more plays and starting to go off the game a little.  Plays a little too slowly for my liking.

Great game! High quality all around, from tactics, to visuals.  I like the card mechanic where a card can be used as a 'move' card, or a 'battle' enhancer card, or even an action card.  Makes for some tough choices during your round of play.

Just what I&#039;ve been looking for in a wargame.  Great card management choices, simple battle resolution, easy terrain and movement rules.  A superb battle system and game that gets my vote for Gamer&#039;s Choice wargame of the year.  Oh yeah, it&#039;s fun too!

I'm not a big wargamer, so for this to get a 6 must mean it's pretty good.  Well, at least I liked it.

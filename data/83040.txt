RATING: 7
An ambitious game about bicycle races. It feels very realistic, like a simulation of the sport. I liked the components, the modular board and the abilities that each member of your team can have. Endless re-playability. The actual race is very strategic, almost no luck involved, and feels different that the other racing games which are more random and exciting. In Leader 1 you control a team of 3 cyclists and you have to plan carefully the moves of each one of them. 

Its a unique simulation of a not so famous sport. Give it a try.

Hell of the North is a hell of a game.

I have been playing games since my early youth at the age of 6 and I used to make my own cycling games with plastic cyclists. I played them everywhere: in the living room, placing books to simulate mountains, on the beach in the sand etc...

I simulated the Tour de France with more than 22 riders, a GC and a complete bookkeeping of yellow jersey, green jersey, mountain GC etc...

Mostly it was based on die rolling of course. 

But THIS game is simply fantastic. Energy management replaces the die rolls. Only the peleton keeps a steady pace with dice rolling and even that can be manipulated.

Great game for those that like cycling races. I would advise 3 or 4 players with 2 cyclists each to keep it manageable. You choose their specs...

But of course my wet dream is having 12 individual riders/ players. Who is going to attack next? And who is going to aid the pursuit ?

Great game. Buy it.

The game design itself is solid and has potential. It has quite a lot going on for it, including special powers, different types of terrain, a fun energy management mechanism, an interesting abstraction of the peloton, and a quite nice components. The two areas that completely let this down though are:

- the lack of playtest/tuning of the various knobs out of the box to make this a tight and tense game
- the abysmal English rulebook, which accomplishes the feat of making a simple game hard to learn

If you are a big fan of cycling and wish to use one of the many variants on the geek (including the new rulebook written by a fellow geek!) to work with the game, I am sure it will make you happy. For me, it was a big miss, and an inexcusably half-baked game. Pass.

The rulebook was translated by a fraud who does not actually speak English. I'm not exaggerating, this game is completely unplayable. I can't believe that RGG would release a game in this condition. 

If you are considering buying this game because of the pretty components, read some forum threads. There will be no answers to your questions. No one really knows how to play this game. There is a user who wrote an entire new rulebook, if you can believe that, but it's nothing like having the support of an actual designer and publisher. 

I have no idea what all the positive ratings are based on. Most of them refer to using the rules of other games (L1, L2, the fan variant, or other ones).  I spent a couple hours trying to sort the gobbledegook in the RB and working through forum threads only to give up. Is this all a hoax or are people just rating the mini's and a game that their buddy made up to play with them? 

I don't get it.

Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for a racing experience.

Jugando una carrera por etapas, es muy tenso y entretenido. Sin embargo, da la sensación de que siempre ganaría el mismo tipo de corredor, junto con algún detalle algo menos realista; pero si te metes en él, puedes incluso plantear estrategias de equipo y se parece a dirigir un equipo ciclista.

Great fun for cycling fans, although the rules are extremely poorly written (full of ambiguities and things left unexplained). From what I remember of the original Leader 1, this is a very big improvement (the new system for the peloton). For a race less dominated by breakaways play with 70% energy values as per the Leader 2 rules (see the files section on the Leader 1 page).

Initial Rating: 5.0 (September 2014)

I hate the theme, so have that in mind  when you read the rest of the comment. Leader 1: Hell of the North is a good racing game, one of the best I have played but still I don’t like it very much, The fact that it is ranked so high in my personal ratings means it can be truly great for other people.

As I wrote before, the theme is very boring for me (in real life and in boardgames), but this is the first racing game I have encountered in which there is truly an strategic component as opposed as pure tactics. Here you need to manage your energy levels AND you know, beforehand. all of the race´s terrain so you can actually plan. Still it has some random elements (uncontrollable luck) which I think cannot be removed from a racing game. That doesn’t mean I have to like it and I don’t. You can lose a 2 hour race due to random events and I HEAVILY dislike that.

The energy management is very well done and the best feature of the game for me, however I felt the decisions are not that hard so I’m not sure how much “game” is actually there. 

The cyclist are very well done and the game looks gorgeous on the table. The components are also good. It seems very thematic but I wouldn’t know as I have never watched the cycling world.

In my only play, all the players used only the sprinter and the climber. The leader (round stats) is always behind. Not sure if that’s the case in all games but it seems so because he isn’t great at anything.

In conclusion, this can be a great racing game, possibly the best cycling game out there, but I still have no desire to play it again as I dislike this kind of game.

Played once, and with some fan-created expansion material so I won't rate the basic game.
The game is an interesting simulation of a cycling race, but might have a bit too much randomness to be enjoyed as a game. (I know randomness is somewhat thematic in this case, but in a game I want my choices to matter more than dice rolls.)
I might have loved this in the past, but now that I have Flamme Rouge, I can't see wanting to play Leader 1 very often except when there are only hardcore cycling fans at the table.

Fantastic simulation of a bike race.  Much more interesting than Formula De in that it captures very nicely well the "flow" of a bike race.  The peleton mechanic is very nice.  Players can sit back in the peleton and conserve energy to some degree, and the peleton can be biased towards catching up with breakaway riders.  The structure of the course will have a big impact on how fun a particular game is, and there might not quite be enough "game" for a long course.  However, if you are a biker, this game is an absolute must play.

Same game as Leader 1 in feel and mechanics, with some variation thrown in re adding cobbles (more risks) and some positioning within the peloton (down back to conserve energy, but must move up to the front the turn before you wish to breakaway, giving some advance notice). Other than that, all the same comments as the original apply, namely great peloton rules, and fantastic bits, but the game's too mathy for mine. For a race game, there's too much counting out when you're trying to work out the best time to breakaway, and the optimum moves once you're out of the peloton. And if you're not playing a tour, then everyone's committed to the end-game breakaway, which doesn't make for much surprise. Still, it has a cycling feel. Lots of theme, but not enough real decision points to make it an interesting game.

Really, a great racing game, the best cycling game that I know. Now, it's possible to replay the spring classics of the North with all different conditions which make them so special: weather, hills (i.e.Koppenberg), cobblestones (Arenberg) etc...It would be nice to have the design of some courses.The new riders look very nice and it's a pleasure to play with them. This game is a must for all who already play Leader 1 or Giro d'Italia.

RATING: 9
Successfully navigates the difficult path between game and simulation. The races feel enough like real cycling races but with minimal book-keeping.

Throughout the entire game it feels as if I'm making small decisions that could turn out to be critical later. Probably the biggest downside is if you realise you've no chance of winning, but that's probably the last 15 minutes of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Take Leader 1, fix the peleton rules, fix the cyclist bits, and add weather and cobblestones. 

If you want a resource management, strategic racing game with the thrill of a long breakaway from the peleton, Hell of the North is your choice. 

If you want a realistic stage race cycling simulation, use Hell of the North with the Leader 2 rules, particularly the reduction in individual energy.

If you want a massive, quick playing, cycling game with the feel of numerous attacks and a living peleton that expands and contracts organically, that resembles watching the Tour de France, with a elements of both roll-and-move and resource management without either mechanic dominating the other, go with Um Refeinbreite with the Homas Tour rules. This will have too much dice rolling for some hard core gamers, but I can play huge stage races with 15 riders in a solitaire format in 60 minutes.

Many complain that the rules are unplayable - they have some gaps, and I much prefer to use the fan-designed rules, but the game is still perfectly playable out of the box.

Szinte tökéletesen valósághű kerékpárverseny szimuláció! A szerencse mértéke kb. az igazi versenyek során felmerülő mértékű.
Aki nem szereti a race game-eket és/vagy a kerékpársportot azt nem hiszem, hogy különösebben vonzaná. Viszont aki a kettő közül akár csak az egyikért is rajong, az nem fog csalódni.
Igen kiváló minőségű komponensek, fun grafika, roppant igényes versenyző figurák. A játék minden porcikájából árad a bicikliversenyek hangulata (trolloknak: nem, dopping lehetőség nincs benne).
A korábbi verziók (Leader 1, Giro) alapján felgyűlt tapasztalat után minden porcikájában érezhetően ki van csiszolva a végletekig. Nagyon tematikus game, elég sok apró szabállyal, amelyek bár logikusak, azért igénylik a befektetett időt (és rutint) a gördülékeny alkalmazáshoz (és, hogy ne feledkezzünk el valamelyikről...).

RATING: 7
Great cycling theme where you can build your route and run a one day race or a multi race tour. If the course has been well thought out then it'll be an interesting decision which team makeup you'll be going for and how you'll approach the race. A steady improvement over Leader 1 with the peleton board positioning cyclists and a few other tweaks and enhancements.

Fun with the right crowd as the maths isn't really maths - it's super basic arithmetic subtracting energy - usually in single digits. Quite dull if players turn it into anything other than a cycling race. The fun is what you bring to the table and this game provides a great framework for a rollicking good time. Plenty of quick and interesting decisions. Table talk and pacts are highly encouraged. Played the right way it's loads of fun, but played the wrong way with players breaking it down to a numbers game with every square up the road examined and pre-counted then it'll be a ho-hum affair. A turn should last 10-15 seconds. Start moving your cyclist and no going back.

Rating gone up a notch due to the great fan made additions to the game. Neutral teams improve any race - even multiplayer. More real world type decisions about who to cover and teams helping each other. Playing with hidden money counters (borrowed from other games) keeps the players guessing others energy levels, introducing a bit of outfoxing and it generally just nicer than crossing off numbers with a pencil. (The down side is that it can be a bit cumbersome if you're juggling more than two cyclists.) Still, lots of potential fun here for those that get the teamwork in cycling.

Great game - gives the feel of "Chess on wheels at 50 kph" as The Tour, and other such races have been described. The game could do with the rules being better translated, and a better marketing job generally could get this game the more love it richly deserves. For example, there are many great looking tracks offered in the Files section here, but they all require tiles from Giro d'Italia as well. Tracks should be provided out of the box to simulate some of the great races. Minor quibbles though - this is an excellent game.

In a day where we abandoned 2 other games because of poor rules and clunky balance, what an absolute delight Leader 1 was. Yes, the rules are pretty heavy going but having summarised the 8 pages in the book to 2 pages of notes, the game became much easier to teach and to understand.

The rules are actually simple enough to then get out of the way and allow the players to simply play against each other. There's just enough luck to keep things difficult to calculate and there's enough push your luck to allow players to take on as much risk as they want.

We ended up playing twice and even the self-professed hater of race games enjoyed herself and said she'd be happy to play again.

This is a clever, interesting, deeply tactical and tense racing game. It's really quite stunningly good.

(Now with added tiles from Giro D'Italia!)

Update: 20 plays in and this remains an exceptional game. My 20th play involved 3 different strategies (2 riders broke early from differing teams - one fell and so the other went on a long solo sprint to the finish - 1 team broke a tile or two later with all 3 riders to chase - and the remaining 2 teams held back in the peloton, pursued with it and made late, late breaks to try and win). First, second and third were from all different teams and different strategies and finished within 2 turns of each other. That's a brilliant design that can allow that to happen.

Rating up from 8.4 to 9.5.

Good re-implementation of "Leader 1" with several new additions (cobbled roads, an improved peloton mechanics which works better than the one in the original, different hexagons, start and finish line are not fixed but can be customized, weather tokens, etc.).
Certainly better than the original. The cyclist minis are also better done than the ones in "Leader 1". All in all I think that the new ruleset is a definite improvement on the old one. Unfortunately, the only salvageable part of the old "Leader 1" to be used with the new one is the track hexagons.

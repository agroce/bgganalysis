Another comic-based card game. Players build their cities, then comes Groo and destroys them for his clumsiness. The game is fun for some time, but winning the game has nothing to do with skill.

Read the comic books, play the game, live the adventure. More enjoyable for those familiar with Sergio Aragones' wandering, wannabe hero, Groo.

RATING: 9.5
Sergio Aragones' Groo The Wanderer comics are are a smart mix of jokes and social commentaries revolving around the moronic, catastrophe-prone Groo (a parody of Conan the Barbarian). I am a fan and I bought this game when it came out - solely because it was illustrated by Sergio. And to my surprise there was a superb game in it too: I've played with many people who have never read the comics, and they've greatly enjoyed this fun card game. And even more amazingly, this excellent game manages to bring to life some of the comic's humour, zany world and chaotic logic. The game fits the theme perfectly.

We played this game almost EXCLUSIVELY for a full year and a half (this was before I discovered BGG) with groups of 2 to 9 players. It has ALWAYS been a success, with players asking for more. We also incorporate the Expansion Set, no matter how many players.

With big groups, we sometimes use a house rule: when the leftover ressource dice are passed around, players also have the choice of attacking the current player's town (at the risk of reducing their troops) - this simple tweak brings about new strategies but makes the game longer.

Love that game. After all these years we still play it and enjoy it immensely :-D

RATING: 7
A card game with probably the highest amount of "take That" it is possible to cram in. More nasty and revengeful things to do, and easier to do them, than in the nuclear war card game. beat the leader up is an absolute must, kicking people when thay are down is also fun. Total chaos, no planning possible, luck driven...pure fun and was designed that way.

If you are familiar with Groo, then the theme will be enjoyable.  The cards seemed terribly unbalanced, so randomness is a big factor.  The mechanic of building using dice is fun, but does not save it.

RATING: 5.5
Luck-heavy.  Some hints of strategy.  There's a lot of text (meaningful text) on some cards... which makes it hard to keep track of special powers of your opponents... and makes for a longer game as everyone needs to keep reading the actions/powers on the cards.  I've never read the comic... so I cannot comment on how well the game incorporates the comic.

More interesting than I thought it would be.  Players take turns choosing from a random pool of resources each turn.  Unfortunately, you can't save resources if you don't build on your turn. This is the major downfall of the game.

I like this game a lot.  Groo&#039;s a fun character; even inspired me to purchase a few of the comics (even though I hadn&#039;t bought any in years!).  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Nice Aragones art and theme on this, but I was never able to get it played. I think a major problem with a game like this is that the theme has a huge appeal to the people who have read the Groo books, and that it is a huge turnoff for people who know nothing about it and/or don't care.

I don't think I was missing very much given my taste in games, because the cards and effects look like the worst of the SJ games, which I am not a fan of at all...but again, did I mention how nice the art and theme is?

Every time a start a game of Groo I think "Why don't I play this more often?"  By the end, I remember.  The variable length of this game is highly annoying, and the play is pretty random.  Nonetheless, it can definitely be fun if you are in the right mood, especially if you have the expansion.

Yes, it's childish.  Yes, it's almost too quick to even be classed as a filler.  Yes, it's silly.  But it's GROO!!.  The artwork alone rocks!!
Viva Sergio Aragones!! Viva Groo!
Bring on the cheese dip!

OK, once the novelty of playing with Groo wears off, (with it does rather quickly) this is basically an revamped game of Old Maid, with Groo as the OM card.  Not a keeper.

All logged plays include the expansion.

RATING: 7
A game that's almost impossible to rate. If you like Groo you'll probably like this game. If you don't know who Groo is and why everything ends up dead around him my guess is that you won't like it. As a major Groo fan I should rate this at 10, but I decided on a 7. Did I err?

RATING: 5
Nice attempt to bring the lovable Groo (from the comic Groo The Wanderer) to a game format.  Plays a little like the Settlers Card Game where you are trying to build a tiny village and avoid Groo wandering in and knocking it down.  A lot of fun if you&#039;re familiar with the comic.

RATING: 6
[2 plays] Reasonably fun card game, even if you don't know the comic.  Reminded me of Race for the Galaxy or Citadels: you start with some cards in your hand that would be great if you could play them, which of course you can't yet for one reason or another, and if you are foolish you hold onto them because they have such promise.  Thus you restrict the usefulness of your hand, and things just stagnate.  The thing to do here is to be ruthless about throwing away what you can't use right away, and to keep churning the deck.

Somewhere between Hot Potato and San Juan, Groo grows exponentially more entertaining with the more people you have involved. Each person tries to build a city worth 7 points, while trying to destroy all their opponents buildings. Not built to be a strategy game, it suffers from randomized resource production and simplistic building placement. Still very fun with the right crowd.

Growing up with a love for Groo compelled me to acquire a copy of this as soon as I knew of it's existence.  However, although it does capture some of the chaos, and does present many of the beloved characters, the game suffers due to the amount of luck.  Strangely enough this luck element usually creates one of two situations - a runaway victory, or a seemingly never ending game.  I like a little element of luck/chaos in most of my games as it prevents a game from becoming stale, but Groo is dependent on luck on too many of it's important phases.  With the above said Groo can be fun with fellow Groo lovers, otherwise it just falls flat - much like a town after Groo has wondered through.

While it's a fun game, it seems to degenerate into attacking back and forth, and causing Groo events to each and everyone, that rarely does anyone win with victory points. I have yet to see this happen. Despite the one downfall, it is a pretty fun, casual game. If you're a Groo fan, you don't want to be without this one, as the theme is captured quite nicely.

This is a pretty fun game, but pretty theme specific, if you don't know Groo, don't play.

If you can look past the artwork, this is a fairly serious empire building game, where you recruit armies, build structures for bonuses and points, and destroy your enemies.  Groo could really just be seen as a roving barbarian horde, which he is all by himself.  Deserves better then the 5.88 it is getting here.

Homemade and then traded away. Not a bad game, but I simply prefer Citadels. The basic game has very few cards, so this expansion is a must.

Utterly chaotic and funny pseudo-M:tG card game, featuring characters and running gags from the long-running comic 'Groo the Wanderer', by Sergio Aragones (of MAD Magazine fame) and Mark Evanier (of no fame whatsoever, despite a writing resume a mile long).  I've played it in a group composed of Groo diehards and casual fans, and a couple of people who never heard of the comic, and we all had a blast.  Biggest danger is the potential for rules lawyering, as the rulesheet can't cover every possible situation that might arise.  Still, any game that has a card that forces you to speak in rhyme in order to use that card gets bonus points from me...  ;)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

It's light and fun.   I just can't believe how few of the people I know have ever heard of Groo.   What's up with that?  One of the most hilarious comics ever, with a neat fantasy/barbarian farce theme, and people who grew up playing D&D never heard of Groo?

Crazy dice game, where you roll dice to generate resources which you use to play cards. Get enough buildings and you win, but you need some people to defend the buildings, or indeed to take down the neighbor who is getting too close to winning. And the highly thematic element of chaos that is Groo, accidently killing half his own army or knocking down buildings. I have a deep love of the source material and while a little variable in length usually ends more quickly than expected, thus not overstaying its welcome. Crazy fun, with emphasis of the crazy.

A favourite game during hiking/camping weekends with friends in the late 90s. Not played since then, until I recently rediscovered it somewhere in the attic.

With lots of dice and cards, you may expect luck playing a major part on this one. It is always fun to watch Groo ruin a city that is about to win the game, he, he! Great, funny art, too! But it can take a lot to end (around 1 hour) - too much for a luck-based card game. And some cards should have their special powers better explained as well.

Needs the expansion.  A bit random, but I like it.  Great art.  Everyone I have taught it to keeps asking where they can get it... not easy to do these days.  Love the Slave Market card and the Orphenage...

Don't play if you have limited time, as it sometimes can go quite long.

Absolutely random. You simply don't have any interesting decision to make. When you are the leader you get bashed, you bash the others and so on. Roll the dice and decide who's the winner before playing and save 45+ minutes of your time.

RATING: 5
Groo is a wild and unpredictable game, and as such some people will really enjoy it, and others will hate it.  It has a very unique resource generating system using dice, not that dissimilar to Yspahan, but more random.  Because of this system, it is possible that a player may not be able to do anything on his turn, and pass a winning roll to his neighbor.  I have seen games end before a player could even take their first turn, and I've seen games continue for a long time.

Groo is a very chaotic game.  The cards are designed to destroy things in front of you and your opponents.  Winning often involves getting the perfect storm of cards just at the right time while getting lucky enough to miss your opponents anger.  If you're looking for a light screw your neighbor style game, Groo isn't a bad option.  But it is definitely not a game for everyone.

I'm a longtime fan of the Groo comic book series, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that this card game is playable even if some rules are odd (like both sides in a battle losing all of their fighters regardless of winner... it's to keep the game balanced, but it's weird).  Great artwork, and surprisingly deep gameplay (you build towns, armies and try to avoid the wandering Groo while sending him to the other players cities) make this a worthy, inexpensive game.

More fun if you know the comic.  Fair bit of randomness, at times you are always tearing the top dog down, other games no one can stop the top player from winning.  However the passing the dice mechanic is fun and they have done a good job of capturing the spirit of the comic in the game.  A fun game, just don&#039;t take it too seriously.

Surprisingly entertaining for such a silly game.  The artwork alone is worth looking at.  Not very challenging but can become somewhat addicting and it's a fantastic travel/time waster candidate--though some space is needed to play as the cards become the board and the "Groo" card needs to move around a bit.

RATING: 5
As soon as we started going through the rules, my first thought was "Munchkin".  It has that whole attempt to build up but then when someone starts to get ahead everyone pounds the leader mechanism.  We played for about 20-30 minutes and nobody had been able to progress more than 50% toward the final victory conditions.  It was way to easy to pound on the leader.  I could see this game going on for hours, which is ridiculous for this type of game.  Groo may be humorous but after watching him smash town after town the humor wears off quickly.

I really enjoy this game.  This was originally bought as a joke because one of my friends really liked the Groo comics--now things will never be the same.

A note of warning, it can get really chaotic, so if you take it too seriously, it will get you in a dither.

Embrace the chaos!  Aside from the expected bash-everyone-you-can gameplay, this game also features a neat system involving the resource dice.  You match the symbols on the dice to those on the cards in your hand in order to get them into play, but whichever dice you don't/can't use, pass to your neighbor, and then around the table until they all get used.  It adds a fresh feeling to what could otherwise be a bit routine (card art notwithstanding).

This mostly just happens. There's clearly very little strategy as evidenced by the cards which make you swap hands with another player. I suspect if I was a Groo fan (or even was more than passingly familiar with his adventures) then this would be funnier.

RATING: 5
Interesting little game that was probably way ahead of its time when it was first released. It oozes theme, has great artwork and offers empire and army building (with cards that work together in interesting ways). Unfortunately, it also involves a lot of randomness, chaos and pretty vicious "take that" actions. Even though I won my first game, I did not like the fact that players could be only one point removed from victory one moment, and be completely wiped from the table the next. Consequently, a single game could probably take anywehere between 30 and 240 minutes. That's a little too chaotic for me.

Here's yet another game in a long line of agonizingly painful Take That! games.  On the one hand, I don't like Take That! games; on the other, it really does fit the theme perfectly.  If the designers had somehow developed it so that all of the Take That! elements came along completely by accident, it would have been perfect.

I’m a huge fan of the art of Sergio Aragonés, and I have followed Groo through many, if not all of his adventures – so this game is a priced gem in my collection. I wish that I had a chance to play it more, but maybe it only appeal to Groo aficionados, and unfortunately not many of my friends have the same passion for the ‘mendicant’ as I do. Anyway, it is a great that I love playing.

Divertido, me encanta el uso de los dados para los materiales.
Siempre lo uso con la expansión, sin ella practicamente no hay ejércitos, se nota que lo hicieron así a drede.
Hay que quitar tres cartas, eso si, las que permiten que los edificios sean inmunes a Groo, si las fabrican con los sobrantes de jugadores estos no tendrán oportunidad de atacar con ejércitos y eliminarlos.

Lamentablemente los dados están hechos con pegatinas que pone el dueño del juego, una producción muy pobre para un juego que si no fuera por las cartas que lo rompen está bien para grupos.

Build a town while staveing off the random visitations of the irrepresible Groo the wanderer (and his little doggy Rafurto), mantain an army to nobble the rival towns in the locality or push Groo towards them and have him to the dirty on them.

I'm a huge fan of Groo the Wanderer, and have collected the comics for ages, but this game is just too dependent on luck. I've tried various house rules, but I still cannot enjoy it as much as I would like to. I will likely never part with it though. Perhaps if I had friends who also loved the comics, then we might enjoy it for the in-jokes, and how it captures the feel of the comics rather well.

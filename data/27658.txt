Miniatures rules the ground! Game play is simple and highly enjoyable. 

The constant buying of minis are a large drawback.

I have two of these boxes, just to get all the cheap dwarfs. This is a great value for Games Workshop, especially the "mini" rules book. This edition of the WFB rules is also very tight. Although I suggest the larger book for those who want to experience the game beyond this introductory set.

My favorite WFB Starter Set because it has a great number of [u]miniatures[/u] to play with, and two of my preferred armies, Dwarf and Goblins (600p each). The over 110 miniatures and props are very nice and the game comes with many different types of units with their own abilities (including magic, heroes or a cannon crew) allowing a lot of tactics. A valuable pack!
I expanded my Goblin army to 2000p adding Goblin units from the 4th Ed. Starter Set, Orc units from the 6th Ed. Starter Set, Goblins Wolf Riders and other Goblin units.
I prefer to play the [url=https://onepagerules.wordpress.com/portfolio/one-page-fantasy/]One Page Fantasy[/url].

Not a game on its own, but rather a starter set to allow a reasonably priced entry into the world of something much better than any board-game - wargaming hobby. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Bad set to buy. Models not best mould.

Good if u want gobbos or dwarf.

Good starter set.

Rules are outdated so u cannot play this rules at local game shop.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
as of year 2014
The company states it themselves they are not a gaming company. Just read their annual reports. 

Bad points:
* not balanced game
 (too many rock beats bigger rock syndrome)
* not clear rules
* high price to start hobby
* crackcast
* bad company reputation
* high price to continue hobby


There are probably other boardgames that are better than this. If u buy starter set and u dont intend to expand then this is ok. 
If u go further (buy powerful models) it will unbalance your game and it will be a competition of who has more money to buy expensive new models with broken rules.

Warhammer Fantasy Battle light ( Another version from another company i Fanatsy warriors). It is enough to get you started and either get bored or want more so you turn to the "real" game Warhammer Fantasy Battle. Bought it to get the figures cheap.

I actually have two full sets (bought used). The sculpts and gameplay don't look like particularly great, but I got them for cheap.

The Box I started Warhammer with. I loved tha game and found 7th Edition to be a very good game, though would still have made a lot of changes to the rules if I had the power.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The latest starter box for WFB.  Comes with a fair number of night goblin and dwarf miniatures to get you started, plus the dice, templates, & rulebook you need.  An awesome deal for $45.  For best bang for your buck, find a friend who wants to buy one also and swap your unwanted race's models to really beef up your respective gobbo/dwarf armies on the cheap.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
This was a bit of a disappointment as an introductory set after the excellent Battle for Macragge set for the Warhammer 40K game.  The miniatures are good, but the included scenarios aren't very good at making learning the game fun like they were in Macragge.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
really nice miniatures and painting them is a pleasure. the game itself is just ordinary warhammer, dice and few tactics

Looking for starter sets to get an army of high quality models as cheap as possible. So I am looking to purchase battle for skull pass and earlier (i.e. Bretonians and lizardmen...). Don't care about box condition or books included, just the models. Please contact me if you are willing to sell.

Tried to play it but the process you have to pass until you start playing is too long. Also, the game is very expensive, has assembly and painting, all of which I don't like.

RATING: 6.5
It's fiddly and not for the casual player. The system bogs it down somewhat by dragging out the turns. It's great with the right people though. This was my first serious tabletop game so it has a lot of sentimental value
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The game system is horribly imbalanced. The rules are extremely complex. The experience in playing the game is not the funnest. Still, I can't help but give it a decent rating for its ability to transport you to another world. A world where you can be anything you want.

Also not a bad choice for players who already own one (or both) of the armies.

Well constructed wargame, yes GW is evil, But this is a great deal and if kept as a self contained game would still be very fun indeed. Well done to GW for finally doing a starter set that is for beginers

RATING: 5
Meh

RATING: 6
I have to admit that I've only played this once and that I was fully sure about the rules but it seems like there's too many charts, different dicerolls and exception/special rules that one has to remember.
With that said; it's a beautiful game and there are some aspects that I really like; the moving in formation, charging, overrunning a.s.o.
One thing I wasn't overwhelmingly intrigued by were the single units - I'ld like it more if it were only groups; less fantasy more midevil warfare.

My friend introduced me into Warhammer Fantasy Battle by making me buy the Battle for Skull Pass set. Now I have a small Dwarf army. I quite enjoyed playing and painting miniatures, though it costed me a lot. Now I'm not playing. I found out that I rather want to get many board games than spend part of my life and leave a fortune for just one battle game. Anyway, I pretty much liked it.

RATING: 8
After some previous mistakes Games Workshop got it right this time. Skull Pass is a terrific deal for getting into WHFB. You get two reasonably sized and diverse armies (plus rules, scenery and gaming aids) in one affordable package.

You really don't need anything more for a while. Good job GW!

RATING: 7
Well, now I finally read all of the 7th ed. rules. They certainly have an interesting world but most of the battles seems to end with one side fleeing rather than one side beating the other one to the ground. If I spend hours reading about how battles are fought in these very complex rules, I don't want my enemies to run away when I charge them.

Intriguing hobby nontheless, with the painting and the modeling and the swearing at thyne own inabilities :D

Even though I have not yet played the game I will give it a temporary 7 for the exquisite components, they are simply stunning...at least until I paint them :D

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This game could be so much more. As with previous editions the playstyle is so hero based.  

Alternating unit actions would make this game so much better.

Painting the mini's is a fun hobby though.

The best way to get into the warhammer hobby.  There is enough depth in the basic set to cover most of the depth of the game and of course enough to get you hooked on it to buy more GW products. :)

Great strategy-game. Beware though, if you start playing WH Fantasy battles, it takes a lot of money and time (to paint your army). Game itself if fun though. Lately Ive stopped expanding my army, takes too much money and its never finished anyway. I have started to invest my money on great boardgames instead.

Great value.  Great looking miniatures.  Looking forward to painting this one.

This game is by no means perfect. There are lots of power balance issues (like Bretonnians being beat sticks), but the game has been with me for 9 years, and I love it. It's just fun. Lots of climatic battles. Tons of fun painting sessions. This is my favorite game of all time.

*Astounding value for money, though I really recommend the hardback rulebook as well if you're not on a budget.  The box set for 6th Edition is good value too, if you can get hold of it, but BfSP really takes the proverbial cake in terms of value.

Of course, to fully enjoy this, you need to devote a large portion of your free time and finances to the Warhammer Hobby.  As such you really need to love the game, the background, modelling and painting.  If you're not sure, this is a good purchase to find out if you're ready to make that commitment.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a great intro to the warhammer hobby, though the dwarf models leave something to be desired.  The scenarios are sound, but it is necessary to get the army books early and expand the armies from the box to have more satisfying games.

RATING: 6
Great value for the miniatures included and it has the full WFB rules.

Dwarves tend to be kinda boring though.

Filed under previously owned since I traded the Dwarves.

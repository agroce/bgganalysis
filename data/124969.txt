The Undead horde - my wife picked this out as her preferred faction simply to have "the bone dragon".  I find it a much more tactical playing faction than the others we've tried so far.  Deployment next to the Lich can definitely turn the tide in a chokepoint battle.

Low-medium complexity fantasy miniatures skirmish game.  It is themed around D&D 4th edition, but has little in common with that game.  Creatures automatically hit when they attack and do a fixed amount of damage (which can be boosted or reduced by card play).  It's fine, but doesn't excite me.  I would prefer to have dice rolls to liven things up.  The miniatures are quite nice for pre-painted minis.  Including cards to use the minis with the [family=9547]D&D Adventure System board games[/family] is brilliant.

Undeath: need to play to faction strengths and not treat it like Orcs (brutal melee power) else will lose badly. Need to use those re-spawn rules + Lich Necromancer to stick it to the enemy. A lot of Undead and Vampire cards really bolster the forces and Dimension Door is a game-changer when played.

Well presented: very nice pre-painted minis; quality art on cards; map on hard stock. I love the fact the that monsters can be directly integrated into other D&D board game sets (Castle Ravenloft, et al) without rules adjustments (brilliant in its simplicity).  I like the idea of various factions and hope that WoC pursues further sets. Basic, fun stand alone skirmish game. The small map squares, however, do not accomidate the minis.

RATING: 7.5
Much better game than I was expecting. Minis were not fantastically painted but good enough and better than plain and i can always touch them up later. A really close battle were I managed to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat because my son got too cocky and wanted to be up close and personal for his killing blow. Looking forward to more battles to come.

RATING: 9
Dungeon Command has been compared to games like Star Wars: Epic Duels, Summoner Wars, and Magic: The Gathering, and there are certainly elements of all of those here. Dungeon Command is primarily a tactical minis game, with movement and positioning being crucial to victory. However, it is also a card game (hence the Magic comparisons) and hand management plays a big role as well.

Each player controls an army of 12 figures and a deck of 30 or more cards. A figure has an inherent movement, attack value, and special abilities. But all of these can be enhanced by playing cards on them. Knowing when to play these cards and how to position your figures are two of the biggest choices the game offers. Despite having diceless combat, almost nothing in this game is calculable, which I love. There is never an obviously right answer for how far you should move, whether you should get a treasure, whether to stay together or split up, to play a card or not, to cower (which hits your morale) or not (which kills your units), and so many other choices.

For a relatively simple rule set, I think Dungeon Command offers a ton of meaningful choices and a depth of gameplay that will require many games to master. None of that even takes into account the additional layer of customizable army/deck-building. This one is a winner.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (February 2013)

I just realized the game has no dice, and that is very attractive for me, however as this game was compared to Mage Wars and Summoner Wars I had huge hopes for it but I was disappointed. I need to give Dungeon Command another chance, as my only game was rushed. 

In my game, I felt I didn’t have a lot of control, the choices were easy in general (low tension), I dislike the treasure as it adds uncontrollable luck, the cards are low quality (sleeve ASAP), the Rulebook is also of low quality (I feel like reading a newspaper)  and (most important for me) the game is not as deep as I have hoped for :( (I wish to be wrong about this). Also I didn’t feel the theme at all, as I know about the D&D world I could imagine it but Mage Wars has more theme IMO. The miniatures are gorgeous though. 

So far, the only advantage it has over Mage Wars and Summoner Wars is that this game has actual miniatures. 

For now, I will play again and see what happen, if I like the game, I will later comment on the Curse of the Undeath Army. 

Current Rating: 6.0

After the success of Mage Wars, desire to play Dungeon Command is very low. I have to rate it accordingly. Also I believe (but I’m not 100% sure) that the game was canceled. It is a shame because the D&D world has lots of potential

This game sits squarely between Magic: The Gathering and Summoner Wars for me--and takes the place of both in my collection. Cool painted minis (that are compatible with the D&D Adventure System games) liven up the presentation but the real hook here is that diceless, card-driven gameplay combined with a decent little tactical miniatures game.

Dungeon Command in general is an under-rated game.  And all the war bands including this one are very fun.  I love the extra cards for Castle Ravenloft.  It is a tactical miniature game which is card driven and has a kind of Magic the Gathering feel.  

This expansion as a Dracolich.  Need I say more.

* I track all Dungeon Command plays, and my overall thoughts on the game, on this item (the first faction I tried). I want to know how often I play it, not how often I play each faction. *

This is an odd duck, but it's a duck that's right up my alley. It combines painted minis (I'm not really into painting), a skirmish wargame (I like short wargames), Magic: The Gathering WITHOUT collectability (I don't play CCGs/LCGs), and the D&D Adventure board games (a great implementation of the best part of 4e: combat) -- all things I really, really like. And it combines them well! There aren't any other games out there that I know of which do exactly what DC does (at least, none that are in print as I write this).

The minis generally look great, the rules are clear (and the exception-driven gameplay is what powers it in any case), the boards and other bits are excellent, and it's easy to learn and teach -- but possesses a good amount of depth. Add in the possibility of building warbands, drafting, 3- and 4-player games, and other options, and it's a fantastic package.

While I can see why it perhaps didn't catch on as much as WotC hoped -- it's an odd duck -- all the things that make it a funny sell work for me. I like that it's expandable, and I even like that it's a dead game: As I'm providing everything for my group, I know how much I "need" to buy if I decide to have it all. Dead is good.

This faction: The undead faction has some of the prettiest minis, and they're an interesting mix in play. I got my clocked cleaned in my first game, unsurprisingly, but I still saw plenty of interesting things and the potential to do cool stuff once I understood my deck and units better.

3 / 5 - Good.

My second favourite set after Goblins. There's no so much variety here but the theme is communicated palpably through the mechanics, and the miniatures are cracking too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I'm not a fan of zombies at all, but this faction is really powerful with action cards certainly related with the theme in the box; this is the only faction I own with almost zero useless cards! That's too much. Probably this is going to be my last purchase of Dungeon Command. 

I'm a little bit sad about it but finally decided to sell all my Dungeon Command boxes. The reasons why:
- Takes too long (excessive downtime) for a game not as deep, I think because of language dependence and all the different activations every player needs to perform.
- Uncontrollable luck in form of treasure.
- Several cards and leaders seem useless, unbalanced or just overpowered.
- Boxes occupy a lot of space and they're just one game.

When I first bought these dungeon command games, I did it only for the miniatures and the tiles, as assets for d&d games. Yesterday after almost 4 years, me and my friends, decided to give them a shot as game.
The game is really interesting, both generals and the races can change a lot the game. It can be played with 3 and 4 people (we tried it both). Havent played the 2 player version yet, but the multiplayer system was great.
Strategy,  wargame, great miniatures and great cards. You have a lot to think, where to move, where to hide, what cards to use, which one to attack and with whom to hold peace. I am glad to have this in my collection. Loved the experience and my friends and wife, already ask for the next gamenight. Try it with multiplayer and have fun!

An easy to learn and play quick skirmish game. It is card driven and the factions are unique and fairly well balanced. The minis are pre-painted and look pretty good for the low price point. These days, I usually prefer something like this for a fantasy skirmish than going through all the work and expense with fielding a Warhammer or Hordes army. Plus the minis work well for my D&D RPG sessions. It's too bad they didn't make a few more factions.

The game system itself is nice, an interesting diceless minaiture combat sytem. It has simple rules, but gains
complexity from multiple unit types with unique special abilities, and Order cards. It's a bit like Magic with
minis, or a really weird version of D&D minis. 
The miniatures in this set are very nice, the Dracolich
and Skeletal Lancer are impressive. If you can get a good price, its
a great source of minis. I purchased this specifically to
add to my D&D Adventure System games, and the Monster Cards
fit right in (especially in Ravenloft). I do wish
there was more included in that way, such as a single
themed adventure. I'm looking forward to future sets. How about
Dark Sun and Gamma World sets?

[b]Pros:[/b]
- Great replayability and variability due to:
--- random card drawing from deck
--- re-positioning of 4 board pieces
--- (so far) 5 very different factions 
--- different positioning and thus strategy of your warband every time
- Beautiful painted miniatures
- Beautiful cards
- Factions are balanced
- You can assemble your own Warband from more than 1 faction

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Lacks mechanic that will make fighting necessary (one player can just hide in convenient place and "wait until the other guy will step into the trap").
- Game under 3 hours are very rare
- There is no point to play it as 3-player game (there is no game mechanic against "hide and wait" strategy until other 2 players fight between each other)

RATING: 8
Fun game, but the price is a bit steep considering you need to have any 2 different sets to have any real fun. And forget customizing unless you want to buy a duplicate set... Seriously, $50 MSRP just to customize ONE army! and to play a good game with 2 of the 5 factions out at this time your at $100.... They need to include duplicates in each set at this price point. Or at least sell individual characters and command card sets. That said, I still bought all of them once and enjoy playing...

Husband's choice which I played to humor him but, boy, did I have fun, can't wait for the next match. Really great 2 player game, cool undead creatures, it plays a bit how Chess would play if Chess had action cards and was way cooler! I like the idea of all the different factions out there that can face each other, it is a mean money pit though since they pretty much ask you to buy at least 2 games to properly play. But for now the 2-player variant of this one faction worked well enough. But yeah, hooked, we will probably invest more money soon. And the art work is extremely fantastic, I totally enjoy the miniatures and looking through the cards.
I know that it fits in as an expansion with other D&D games but I rate it here as a game in itself.
I loved that there are no dice to roll and fight with, I always preferred cards over dice luck. Since I am neither a war gamer, role player (D&D) nor a miniature gamer I am really surprised by how much I like this. Personally I don't know similar games (I know they exist) therefor it fills a nice spot in our home collection.
Concerning the Undead specifically, they seem to ask for a more cautious and strategic game play than some other factions because they are not that strong by itself or come with utterly aggressive cards; they are a nice challenge!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The undead army seem to be set up to both swarm and play the long game as they gain leadership faster than any other army. I was mildly concerned about replayability, but since each turn you should only see about a third of your order cards and maybe a half of your creatures this should easily last 5 or 6 plays - at which point you change up the opposing army.

It doesn't feel particularly chaotic either, though I'd really only recommend the 2 player game...

Played this once with 4 people and enjoyed the mechanics but I'm not sure about the balancing of a 4-player game. 3 of us piled in for a fight while the fourth sat by the entrance at the other end of the dungeon, and won by doing nothing for the entire game.  That's strategically sound,  but not fun.
